First, a previously healthy child may be admitted to the PICU because of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The pneumonia is usually caused by organisms that are prevalent in the out-of-hospital environment. Second, patients with genetic or acquired immune defi ciency commonly develop severe pneumonia with opportunistic infections that usually do not infect healthy children. These immunocompromised patients commonly have been given chemo-radiotherapy for cancer or are receiving immune-suppressive agents to prevent rejection episodes following solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Third, both previously healthy and immunocompromised patients may acquire nosocomial pneumonia during their hospital stay. Mechanically ventilated patients are at especially high risk to develop nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Finally, aspiration pneumonia caused by chronic inoculation of the lower respiratory tract with large amounts of less virulent bacteria in a susceptible host prone to aspiration is also observed in the PICU.",

            "text": "The conducting airways also contain several antimicrobial substances, including immunoglobulins (IgG and secretory IgA), and complement that bind and enhance the elimination of microbial agents. In addition, airway epithelial and alveolar type (AT) II cells secrete several antimicrobial peptides. One of the best characterized families of antimicrobial peptides are the defensins, which are cysteine-rich peptides possessing broad antimicrobial activity [4] . An important recent discovery is the expanding role of respiratory airway epithelium in innate immune defenses by mechanisms that mimic those noted in phagocytic cells. Respiratory epithelial cells, including ATII cells, express TLR and are capable of expressing a variety of cytokines that amplify infl ammation. The importance of innate immunity in epithelial cells was confi rmed in mice with specifi c inhibition of nuclear factor (NF) \u03baB activation that was restricted to distal airway epithelial cells. Mice lacking the ability to activate NF\u03baB in epithelial cells exhibited impaired infl ammatory response to inhaled LPS [5] . These data provide evidence that distal airway epithelial cells and the signals they transduce play a key physiologic role in lung infl ammation in vivo. Alveolar type II cells also secrete surfactant proteins (SP)-A and D. Both SP-A and SP-D are collagen-like lectins (collectins) that agglutinate and/or opsonize pathogens and enhance their phagocytosis by innate immune cells such as alveolar macrophages and neutrophils [6] . Surfactant proteins A and D may have additional immunoregulatory functions [7] and also may exhibit direct bactericidal effects by inducing damage to the bacterial cell membrane [8] . The functions of SP-A and SP-D in host defense are listed in Table 17 .1.",

Macrophages have the capacity to induce the generation of large amounts of cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), nitric oxide, and potent oxidants that participate in antimicrobial defenses. In contrast, interstitial macrophages are located in the lung connective tissue and serve as both phagocytic cells and antigen-processing cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, a macrophage-derived multifunctional cytokine, is expressed early in both patients with and animal models of pneumonia [9] . Microbes also induce macrophages to generate potent chemokines that attract circulating neutrophils and monocytes into the lungs. Cytokines/ chemokines amplify infl ammatory responses and orchestrate the polarization and transition of innate to adaptive immunity that function to eliminate invading microorganisms [10] .

Most episodes of VAP are thought to develop from the aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions containing potentially pathogenic organisms. Aspiration of gastric secretions may also contribute, although likely to a lesser degree. Tracheal intubation interrupts the body's anatomic and physiologic defenses against aspiration, making mechanical ventilation a major risk factor for VAP. The term aspiration pneumonia should be reserved for pneumonia or pneumonitis resulting from the aspiration of large amounts of gastric or oropharyngeal contents that may contain a large inoculum of relatively nonvirulent bacteria. The pathogens that commonly produce CAP or VAP, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Gram-negative bacilli, and Staphylococcus aureus, are relatively virulent bacteria so that only a small inoculum is required and the aspiration is usually subtle.",

Blood culture may reveal organisms in up to 30% of patients with bacterial pneumonia [22] . Sputum collection is usually not practical for infants and children, and bacterial organisms recovered from the nasopharynx do not accurately predict the etiology of pneumonia. However, recovery of viruses and other atypical pathogens from the nasopharynx is more predictive.

Nosocomial bacterial infections remain the most common cause of pneumonia during the early posttransplant, neutropenic phase. Staphylococcus aureus and Gramnegative pathogens predominate. In addition, fungal infections with Candida and Aspergillus species are not uncommonly seen during a severe neutropenic phase. The second period, from 1 to 6 months after solid organ transplant, is the time when opportunistic infections more commonly associated with transplantation, including Nocardia, P. carinii/jiroveci, and CMV are observed [26] .

Those with allograft dysfunction and ongoing heavy immunosuppressive therapy remain subject to all of the opportunistic infections seen during the second period.

Because progression to respiratory failure may be rapid, an aggressive approach to diagnosis and treatment is necessary to limit morbidity and mortality. Initial broad-spectrum therapy is important, with alterations of the empiric regimen once the clinical situation has stabilized and more diagnostic information has been obtained. In the immunocompromised host, BAL procedure should be performed promptly to rule out infectious etiologies. lists suggested BAL fl uids analysis studies and cultures. Bronchoalveolar lavage is very helpful in the diagnosis of P. carinii/jiroveci, CMV, tuberculosis, and some fungal infections. However, the ability of BAL fl uids analysis and culture to detect invasive aspergillosis, one of the most lethal infectious complication after transplantation, is limited [27] . The diagnostic yield for Aspergillus species infection has been enhanced by the recently developed ELISA that detects galactomannan, a fungal cell wall component released during invasive disease [28] . Histopathologic analysis and culture of open lung biopsy specimens may provide accurate determination for the cause of pulmonary infi ltrates in pediatric patients [29] . However, open lung biopsy is associated with a signifi cant surgical risk in critically ill patients. Open lung biopsy is most effective and least risky when performed early in the course of patients who develop nodular infi ltrates that require rapid differentiation between fungal infections and more benign lesions [30] . Chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infections is an important component of management of the post-transplant immunosuppressed patients. Before the widespread introduction of chemoprophylaxis, P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) was observed to be a common opportunistic infection among transplant recipients. With the administration of low-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or an alternative prophylactic agent such as pentamidine, PCP can be effectively prevented [31] . Prophylaxis is also recommended for CMV in high-risk CMV seronegative recipients. Such prophylaxis includes intravenous ganciclovir for 14 days, followed by oral ganciclovir capsules for three months [32] .",

Histories of seizure, anesthesia, or other episode of reduced level of consciousness, neurologic disease, dysphagia, or gastroesophageal refl ux are all risk factors for aspiration. The risk of aspiration is especially high after removal of an endotracheal tube because of the residual effects of sedative drugs, the presence of a nasogastric tube, and swallowing dysfunction related to alterations of upper-airway sensitivity, glottic injury, and laryngeal muscular dysfunction [33] . Aspiration pneumonia may be classifi ed into three clinical syndromes: chemical pneumonitis, bacterial infection, and airway obstruction. In animal models, development of chemical pneumonitis requires a 1 to 4 mL/kg inoculum of fl uid with a pH of 2.5 to initiate an infl ammatory reaction that may lead to pulmonary fi brosis [34] .

Combining clinical and bacteriologic evaluation is probably the best way to achieve the objectives of correctly diagnosing VAP and appropriately using antimicrobial agents. The main aims of this diagnostic approach are to rapidly identify patients with true lung bacterial infection, to select appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy, to adjust therapy based on antibiotic sensitivities, and to withhold antibiotics from patients without VAP. Guidelines for the prevention of VAP in children are lacking, but data extrapolated from adult studies support routine elevation of head of bed 30\u00b0, appropriate use of sedatives and muscle relaxants, and adequate oral and circuit hygiene [46] .",

Antibiotic therapy should be intravenous until the patient becomes afebrile and then should be continued orally for an additional 2-3 weeks. There is major debate as to the proper adjuvant treatment of children with empyema. Prospective, randomized and controlled studies of children with empyema are lacking. With the exception of starting appropriate or empiric antibiotics, there is no consensus on when and in whom to place a chest tube, instill fi brinolytic agents, or take to the operating room [52] . In 1992, Light suggested that chest tubes should be inserted if the pleural fl uid is gross pus, if the Gram stain of the pleural fl uid is positive, if the pleural fl uid glucose level is below 40 mg/dL, or if the pleural fl uid pH level is less than 7.00 [53] . If drainage with a chest tube is unsatisfactory, either urokinase or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) should be injected intrapleurally [54, 55] . If drainage is still unsatisfactory, a decortication should be considered [56] . A stage-related approach to the management of empyema is perhaps most effi cacious and cost-effective [57] . In the exudative stage, conservative treatment using tube drainage may suffi ce. Fibrinolytic treatment may be useful during the fi brinopurulent stage. In contrast, aggressive treatment using surgical decortication may be necessary during the organizing stage.",
