After estimating the serial interval of COVID-19 from 105 hand-collected pairs of the virus carrier and the infected, we calculate the daily effective reproductive number, R, for each of all 100 Chinese cities with more than 40 cases. Using the daily R values from January 21 to 23, 2020 as proxies of nonintervened transmission intensity, we find, under a linear regression framework, high temperature and high humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19, respectively. One-degree Celsius increase in temperature and one percent increase in relative humidity lower R by 0.0225 and 0.0158, respectively. This result is consistent with the fact that the high temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of influenza and SARS. It indicates that the arrival of summer and rainy season in the northern hemisphere can effectively reduce the transmission of the COVID-19. We also developed a website to provide R of major cities around the world according to their daily temperature and relative humidity:",

However, up to now, there is no direct evidence on the influence of temperature and humidity on the transmission of the COVID-19. For example, on March 06, 2020, Michael Ryan, the executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, said that people still did not know the activity or behavior of the COVID-19 virus in different climatic conditions (9) . Our paper aims to provide direct evidence. Since the COVID-19 has spread widely to Chinese cities, and the intensity of transmission and weather conditions in these cities vary largely ( Figure 1 ), we can, therefore, analyze the determinants of COVID-19 transmission, especially the weather factors.",

This finding is consistent with the evidence that high temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of influenza (14, (16) (17) (18) (19) , which can be explained by two possible reasons: First, the influenza virus is more stable in cold temperature, and respiratory droplets, as containers of viruses, remain airborne longer in dry air (20, 21) . Second, cold and dry weather can also weaken the hosts' immunity and make them more susceptible to the virus (22, 23) .",

Therefore, as a robustness check, we remove Wuhan city in our sample and redo both the cross-sectional and panel regressions. The results of robustness checks, presented in Table S2 , are consistent with those in Table 1 (7)), the regression coefficients will be quite different, and the distribution of the coefficients will be highly skewed. However, in Table S3 , the mean and median of the bootstrapped coefficients are quite similar, which means the coefficient distribution is not skilled.

            "text": "although our paper suggests that the arrival of summer and rainy season in the northern hemisphere can effectively reduce the transmission of the COVID-19, it is unlikely that the COVID-19 pandemic diminishes by summer since the central U.S., northwest China and countries in the southern hemisphere (e.g. Australia and South Africa) still have a high coronavirus transmission as shown in Figure 3. Therefore, other measures such as social distancing are still important for blocking the COVID-19 transmission. A city-level visualization of the COVID-19 transmission (a), temperature (b) and relative humidity (c). Average R values from January 21 to 23, 2020 for 100 Chinese cities are used in subplot (a). The average temperature and relative humidity for the same period are plotted in (b) and (c). Subplots (a), (b) and (c) together inform that the R values are larger in the cold and dry northern regions of China. (c) Effective reproduction number R v.s. absolute humidity Effective reproductive number R v.s. temperature, relative humidity and absolute humidity for 100 Chinese cities Daily R values from January 21 to 23 and temperature, relative humidity and absolute humidity averaged 3 days up to and including the day of R measurement are used in this figure. Negative relationships between temperature and R, relative humidity and R and absolute humidity and R are shown in (a), (b) and (c), respectively.

By analyzing the records of each patient's contact history with other patients, we match 209 close contacts. Among them, if a group of patients travel (e.g. go to Wuhan) together, we hence cannot distinguish between the carrier and the infected, and, therefore, remove such samples from the data. We finally screen out 105 pairs of virus carriers and the infected, which are used to estimate serial intervals of COVID-19. We also construct epidemic curves for all 100 Chinese cities with more than 40 cases from their first-case dates to February 20, which are constructed using more than 70,000 cases. The epidemic curves are used to estimate the daily effective reproductive number, R, for different cities.Temperature and relative humidity data are obtained from 699 meteorological stations in China from http://data.cma.cn/. If a city does not have a meteorological station inside it, the closest station is used instead. Population density, GDP per capita, number of hospital beds and the fraction of the population over 65 years old in 2018 for different cities are obtained from https://data.cnki.net. Distribution of the serial interval The serial interval, defined as the time span between symptom onset dates of a primary case to a successive case, is calculated based on the 105 samples of the carrier and the infected. Specifically, we fit the Weibull distribution (2, 3) using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method 1 and obtain the parameters of the mean and standard deviation of 7.4 and 5.2 days, respectively, which are consistent with the preliminary estimation (4) using 10 cases (7.5 days average with 95% confidence interval of 5.3 to 19). Compared to SARS (3), the COVID-19's serial interval has a smaller average but a larger standard deviation. The fitted Weibull distribution is shown in",
