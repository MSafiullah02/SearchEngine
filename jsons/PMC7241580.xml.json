Therefore, in prevention, media could play a vital role. The public health authorities should have consideration for the issue along with other necessary measures during the management of emergencies such as pandemics and epidemics. Media factors responsible for spreading the PB should be strictly monitored such as publishing news with the image of empty shelves should be avoided, especially in social media. Adequate information should be distributed to the media that can help gain the faith on the ruling government, the supply chain measures, and status so that people can understand that the government is capable of dealing with the crisis and there is efficient national as well as local supply chain management system (Lufkin 2020). Identification of fake news and ignoring them or reporting about it to appropriate authority may also be beneficial in the prevention of panic buying. Reduction of fear regarding the scarcity, the pandemics, and the necessary goods should be attempted.",

Limiting the discussion of the scarcity of essential things and avoiding such anxiety-provoking discussion can be a measure to limit panic buying. Similarly, at the individual level, fear of uncertainty may accelerate anxiety and it may result in poor self-regulation (failure in impulse control) leading to panic buying. Measures that reduce anxiety effectively and improve self-regulation (impulse control) may reduce PB behavior.",
