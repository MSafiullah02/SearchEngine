Three studies on feline pulmonary rhodococcosis have been reported from Italy, the USA and Australia.4,24,25 These studies characterised R equi infection in cats and compared it with the disease reported in a highly susceptible host; that is foals. Two previous studies reported feline pulmonary rhodococcosis based on the history, clinical presentation and cytological evaluation of the tracheal exudate without any necropsy confirmation. Immunosuppression was suspected in these cats based on the intestinal lymphoma in one cat and clinical presentation only in another cat.4,24 Radiographic features of feline pulmonary rhodococcosis have not been described to date because of the limited number of cases reported. In foals, radiographic findings include an unstructured interstitial pattern, various combinations of the alveolar pattern, nodular or cavitary lesions and lymphadenopathy, especially tracheobronchial and pleural effusion. Furthermore, the severity of radiographic finding significantly correlated with the survival of the foals infected with R equi.26",

Radiographs were reviewed by two veterinarians to reach a consensus. Severity criteria for radiographic pulmonary patterns were adopted from a study by Crisi et al,27 where bronchial signs were categorised as mild, moderate and severe based on the first-, second- and third-generation bronchi visibility. Alveolar patterns were categorised as mild when there was presentation of isolated fluffy infiltrates, moderate when the pattern was well defined with air bronchograms and severe with lobar signs. Interstitial changes were categorised as mild when an interstitial framework was visible but when a bronchial pattern was suspected as well the moderate category included an interstitial framework distinguishable from bronchial; and the severe category was recorded for undisputed reticular interstitial patterns. Visualisation of a vascular pattern was aided by the relative enlargement of pulmonary vessels between the artery and vein.",

Protein levels in equine cases can be influenced by physiological factors, such as age, pregnancy, and clinical infections and inflammatory processes.40,45 In cats, these changes have also been attributed to systemic diseases, haematological disorders, chronic infections, inflammatory process and neoplastic disorders.46 Hence, these physiological and clinical scenarios highlight the value of protein level changes in cats and horses, especially in ongoing infections and inflammatory processes. An alternative and major differential diagnosis for a low A:G ratio (median value for 36 samples in the present study was 0.6; range: 0.5\u20131.4) is FIP,47 which should be excluded first in this type of clinical finding. Changes in protein levels accompanied by clinical presentations should not prevent clinicians from making a differential diagnosis of R equi infection in the prior screening list.

Other possible options for chest drainage are chest tube thoracostomy, diagnostic and/or therapeutic thoracoscopy and thoracotomy, which can be integrated with a single or multiple lavage, intermittent or continuous suction and intrapleural fibrinolytics administration, and also can be helpful in sample collection.54 In the present study, eight cats with the pulmonary form of the disease were managed by chest tube placement: four recovered, two were euthanased and two died during long-term management of the disease.",

Diagnostic and/or therapeutic thoracocentesis was performed in 33 cats presenting with acute respiratory distress while receiving oxygen by face mask or the flow-by method. Concurrent fluid therapy with shock rate was also considered in patients presenting with septic or distributive shock. After this acute management phase, IV antibiotics were administered during the initial course of the disease and were finally replaced by oral antibiotics. All cats that were boarded and required needle thoracentesis more than twice after initial chest tapping were advised to be managed further with chest tube placement. Further indications for chest tube placement included the inabillity to achieve negative pressure at the end of thoracocentesis, if the patient was deteriorating despite multiple needle thoracentesis, and if daily lavage and continuous or intermittent suction was required, and after thoracotomy surgery.55",

A complete history and thorough physical examination are mandatory to investigate the exposure to infection. Thoracic radiographs are effective in describing the clinical signs and deciding on disease management. Bacterial cultures along with cytology are the key tests in making a definitive diagnosis in cats. The effectiveness of the therapy depends on the susceptibility of the antibiotic combination being used for treatment. The overall prognosis appears to be poor, based on the results of this study. Much is still unknown regarding immune status-related predisposing factors, epidemiology, virulence and pathogenesis of R equi in cats. Further clinical, prospective and experimental studies are necessary to elucidate the various aspects of R equi infection in cats.",
