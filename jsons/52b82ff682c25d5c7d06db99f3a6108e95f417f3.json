The purified peptides exerted an inhibitory action on mycelial growth in various fungal species. The antifungal activity of Brassica and mung bean nsLTPs were thermostable, pH-stable, and stable after treatment with pepsin and trypsin. In contrast, the antifungal activity of mung bean chitinase was much less stable to changes in pH and temperature. Brassica LTP inhibited proliferation of hepatoma Hep G2 cells and breast cancer MCF 7 cells with an IC 50 of 5.8 and 1.6 \u00b5M, respectively, and the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC 50 of 4 \u00b5M. However, mung bean LTP and chitinase were devoid of antiproliferative and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activities. In contrast to the mung bean LTP, which exhibited antibacterial activity, Brassica LTP was inactive. All three antifungal peptides lacked mitogenic activity toward splenocytes. These results indicate that the two LTPs have more desirable activities than the chitinase and that there is a dissociation between the antifungal and other activities of these antifungal proteins.",

The supernatant was designated as the crude extract. The crude extract was first fractionated by ammonium sulfate to 20% saturation. After centrifugation, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant obtained to 80% saturation. The mixture was then centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded, while the precipitate was collected and dissolved. The solution of ammonium sulfate precipitate was dialysed against 0.02 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.4) with several changes, and then applied to an open CM-Sephadex C-50 column (2.5 \u00d7 55 cm) previously equilibrated with the starting buffer. After removal of the unadsorbed proteins, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (200-400 mM) in the same buffer. The first fraction (P1) was pooled, dialysed against 0.02 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 6.0 at 4\u00b0C for 24 h, and subsequently chromatographed on a column of POROS-HS (0.75 \u00d7 7.5 cm) that had been equilibrated with 0.02 M PBS, pH 6.0. Following removal of a large quantity of unadsorbed materials, the column was eluted with a gradient of NaCl (0-0.7 M) in the same buffer to yield four peaks.

            "text": "When the crude B. campestris seed extract was chromatographed on Q-Sepharose, antifungal activity resided in the broad unadsorbed fraction Q1 and not in the sharp adsorbed fraction Q2. Fraction Q1 was resolved on Affi-gel blue gel into a broad unadsorbed fraction B1 devoid of antifungal activity and a smaller adsorbed fraction B2 with antifungal activity. Fraction B2 was fractionated on Mono S into a number of fractions. Antifungal activity was found in fractions S2, S3, and S4. Final purification of fraction S2 was achieved by gel filtration on a Superdex Peptide column. Antifungal activity was detected in the main absorbance peak designated as P1. The yields of the crude extract, fractions Q1, B2, S2, and P1, from 400 g of seeds were 19 430, 7310, 850, 130, and 70 mg, respectively. Fraction P1 representing the purified peptide displayed a molecular mass below 14.4 kDa in SDS-PAGE, 94 kDa in gel filtration in Superdex peptide, and 9414 kDa in mass spectrometry. Its N -terminal sequence closely resembled those of nsLTPs from seeds and leaves of other species including that of P. mungo (Table 1) . It inhibited mycelial growth in Fusarium oxysporum, Helminthosporium staivum, Mycosphaerella arachidicola, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Verticivium albotarum ( Figure 1 ). The IC 50 values of its antifungal activity toward F. oxysporum and M. arachidicola were 8.3 \u00b5M and 4.5 \u00b5M, respectively. The antifungal activity was stable at various temperatures between 20 and 100\u00b0C (Figure 2(A) ), and at various pH values between 0 and 4, and between 9 and 14 ( Figure 2(B) ), and after treatment with either trypsin or pepsin for 1-4 h (Figure 3 ). Mung bean nsLTP yielded similar thermostability, pH stability, and protease resistance data (data not shown). The antifungal activity of mung bean chitinase underwent an abrupt decline when the pH was raised to 8 and when the temperature was increased to 80\u00b0C (data not shown). Mung bean nsLTP and chitinase inhibited mycelial growth in F. oxysporum with an IC 50 of 17.6 \u00b5M and 20 \u00b5M, respectively. The Brassica nsLTP resembles mung bean nsLTP in lipid binding activity (Figure 4) . The Brassica nsLTP inhibited proliferation of HepG2 cells and MCF7 cells with IC 50 values of 5.8 \u00b5M and 1.6 \u00b5M, respectively ( Figure 5(A) ), and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC 50 of 4 \u00b5M (Figure 5(B) ). It did not inhibit HIV-1 integrase and SARS virus proteinase, however (data not shown). By contrast, mung bean nsLTP and chitinase were inactive toward the tumor cells and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (data not shown). The antibacterial activity of mung bean nsLTP had previously been reported [3] but such activity as well as mitogenic activity was lacking in B. campestris nsLTP.",

            "text": "The finding that mung bean nsLTP is adsorbed on the cationic exchange chromatographic media CM-Sephadex and POROS HS-20 [4] is in line with reports on other antifungal proteins. Mung bean chitinase is, however, unadsorbed on POROS-HS [4] . Antifungal activity is undetectable in the seed extracts of several Brassica species from which napin-like polypeptides have been isolated [15] [16] [17] . It is thus noteworthy that an antifungal nsLTP could be isolated from B. campestris and also from mung bean seeds. The nsLTPs have remarkable pH stability, thermostability, and resistance to pepsin and trypsin. This, together with the fact that they are peptides and that B. campestris nsLTP have HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory and antiproliferative activities, suggests that the two nsLTPs, especially B. campestris nsLTP, have potential applications. Some, but not all, LTP have been demonstrated to have antifungal activity [13, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . It is interesting that Brassica and mung bean LTPs inhibit mycelial growth in a number of fungal species. Their high antifungal potency on F. oxysporum and M. arachidicola, a banana pathogen and a peanut pathogen, respectively, suggests their potential usefulness in the prevention of these diseases. In addition, they exert antifungal activity on a number of other fungal species. The two nsLTPs have similar lipid binding activity. Whether they have any of the functions/attributes reported for other nsLTPs such as allergenicity, surface wax biosynthesis, calmodulin binding, cryoprotection, and peroxisomal fatty acyl CoA binding remains to be elucidated [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Mung bean chitinase also inhibits a broad spectrum of fungal species [4] .",

The range of pH values and temperatures over which some other antifungal proteins can withstand without loss of antifungal activity may be narrower than what has been observed for Brassica and mungbean nsLTPs, like in the case of mung bean chitinase. The thermostability and pH stability of the chitinase activity [4] and antifungal activity of mung bean chitinase are similar, suggesting that the same part of the chitinase molecule is responsible for both activities.",

In contrast to other antifungal proteins [8] , it does not inhibit HIV-1 integrase. There is no effect on the SARS virus proteinase either. The Brassica protein also manifests antiproliferative activity toward hepatoma and breast cancer cells with a fairly high potency.
