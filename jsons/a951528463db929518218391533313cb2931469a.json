Wuhan city was put under lockdown since Jan 23, 2020, and many other cities in China implemented similar policies in the next few days. As of Jan 24, 2020, southwestern China, including Chongqing City, Sichuan Province, Guizhou Province and, Yunnan Province, have initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies. Rapid measures have been taken to isolate confirmed or suspected patients and trace and quarantine their close contacts. Situation updates of COVID-2019 and health information have been widely disseminated through TV, internet, radio, and newspapers, and even broadcast on the streets and in villages. The government has encouraged civilians to reduce their going out and gathering. In this situation, many industries have suffered property damage worth hundreds of millions of yuan. The Chinese government has introduced some policies to compensate the losses of enterprises and individuals by reducing taxes, providing low-interest loan support, and full refunds for individuals who already purchased a ticket for public transportation.",

Zhang reported that the rates of depression, neurasthenia, fear, anxiety, and hypochondriasis were 36.40%, 37.21%, 79.70%, 33.41%, and 27.69%, respectively, among 2709 civilians in Zhejiang Province during the outbreak of human H7N9 avian influenza [7] . The National Health Commission of China promulgated the notification of basic principles for emergency psychological crisis interventions for COVID-2019 on Jan 26, 2020 [8] . This notification stated that the public might experience panic, disappointment, and anger, especially those who had confirmed or suspected infection of SARS-CoV-2; that people who were in quarantine might experience anxiety, discrimination, boredom, loneliness, guilt, and stigma; and that mental health support should be provided for the public in need. Then, online psychological counseling services and psychological assistance hot-lines were rapidly established by mental health professionals in medical institutions, universities, and academic societies throughout all 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in mainland China, which provide free 24-h services every day including weekends, as well as providing psychological selfhelp intervention systems and artificial intelligence (AI) programs for psychological crises intervention [9] .",

If those reactions cannot be relieved in time, they are likely to lead to further irrational behaviors, such as the panic buying of materials in Beijing during SARS, the rush for salt during the Fukushima nuclear leak in Japan, and more serious violent behavior [10] . Although the epidemic was in a rapid outbreak stage, some individuals seemed to remain unaware of the true danger of SARS-CoV-2. It is unclear whether there is any difference in psychological response between individuals who directly felt the threat of COVID-2019 (were quarantined or their acquaintance were quarantined) and people who were not directly affected by the epidemic. Anxiety and mood disorders are the most common mental health problems in the general population all over the world [11] , and there are important connections between anxiety and depression and occurrence of viral diseases [12] . However, the epidemiological data on the Chinese general population remain unavailable, and how to best respond to challenges during the outbreak is unknown [13] . Therefore, determining the prevalence of anxiety and depression, as well as differences and associated factors among the public, is the first important step for implementing early targeted intervention, reducing the possibility of further irrational behaviors and helping people return to normal life. This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among people affected by quarantine and those unaffected during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020.",

In the Chinese public, the index score has the following 4 categories [15] : no anxiety (lower than 50); low anxiety (50~59); moderate anxiety (60~69), and severe anxiety (higher than 70).

Another reason might be that the participants had misconceptions about COVID-19 caused by false propaganda, rumors, and defamation. Misconceptions can provoke anxiety, such as one report that caused the panicked buying 'Shuanghuanglian' (a traditional Chinese herbal medicine) among the general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Lienemann et al. reported that during the H1N1 epidemic in India, media reporting of inaccurate information contributed to widespread anxiety, fear, and panic in the general public [32] . We also found that a high level of depression was correlated with having no psychological support or counseling from the community/government agencies. The individuals who had depression symptoms instead tended to not seek help [33, 34] . Their perception of stigma and embarrassment and their preference for self-reliance were the most important barriers to help-seeking [35] . Therefore, enhancing public knowledge about mental disorders is essential to increase help-seeking behavior [36] .",

Its sampling design is subject to many of the usual biases of internet-based surveys, and the sample is not necessarily representative of the general population. In addition, we did not consider other factors that may have confounded the outcomes, such as the actual level of knowledge about COVID-19 and the social support of family and friends, which are commonly considered to be associated with anxiety and depression. Finally, we only roughly divided the population into an 'affected group' and an 'unaffected group' according to their quarantine situation, and we did not conduct a subgroup analysis between population with different exposure levels. Future studies should delve deeper into those issues. The strength of the study is its use of timely data from a large number of respondents at the early stage in the COVID-19 epidemic and its scientific importance for the study of mental response and early intervention during the early stage of an epidemic of a novel virus.",
