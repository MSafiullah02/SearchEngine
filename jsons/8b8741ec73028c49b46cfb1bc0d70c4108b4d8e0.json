Additionally, during this unique pandemic period, all medical staff and the general population are well aware of the disease. Once individuals presented any COVID-19 related symptoms, they would receive confirmation testing. Once the diagnosis was confirmed, the patient would be referred to The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen for further treatment as soon as possible. Medications such as antipyretics (acetaminophen), antibiotics (macrolides, quinolones), or steroids before admission were very unlikely and thus, any effect of these drugs on the results would not be substantial.",

As we have reported, severe cases of COVID-19 are defined by the official clinical practice guidelines of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society, and respiratory abnormalities are a key criteria of diagnosis. Mechanical ventilation was usually needed in severe cases, which has been reported in a recent study. Furthermore, in ours and other studies [1, [3] [4] [5] , severe cases consistently showed a higher percentage of severe liver abnormality than non-severe cases. As Remdesivir was not used in our hospital, we could not assess its effects on liver function.",

Actually, some related experimental studies in our Hospital are ongoing and hope to give answer to these questions. Inspired by the current study, we will conduct more in-depth studies in the future to better enable our understanding of the mechanisms and treatment for this disease.",

For example, a recent study failed to replicate the expression of ACE2 in the alveolar type II (AT2) cells or in the AT2 lung carcinoma cell line A549 [7] . Similarly, our study showed that patients treated with ACE-inhibitors/ARBs were not at increased odds of progressing to severe disease compared to patients taking other antihypertensive drugs. These results indicate that the expression of ACE2 in the human respiratory system may be limited, and thus the expression of the receptor in lung or respiratory epithelia on the protein level is yet to be confirmed. Most concerns above have been discussed in our discussion section.",
