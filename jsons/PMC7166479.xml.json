            "text": "In ferrets, there is a large jejunal lymph node in the mid\u2010abdomen at the root of the mesentery which is commonly palpable in healthy individuals (Paul\u2010Murphy et al. 1999). The jejunal lymph node is also known as the mesenteric lymph node or cranial mesenteric lymph node. According to the Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria (WAVA\u2010ICVGAN 2012), while the jejunal lymph nodes are part of the cranial mesenteric lymphocentre, carnivores lack a cranial mesenteric lymph node. Therefore, although historically this lymph node has been identified as the mesenteric lymph node, it may be more appropriately termed the jejunal lymph node in ferrets, and will be referred to as such throughout this article. In both previous studies evaluating ferret lymph nodes with ultrasound, a single large jejunal lymph node was found in all animals (Paul\u2010Murphy et al. 1999, Garcia et al. 2011). With ultrasound, the jejunal lymph node was described as a round to ovoid structure with uniform echogenicity near the centre of the small intestinal mesentery and near the cranial and caudal mesenteric veins surrounded by fat (Paul\u2010Murphy et al. 1999). The mean and standard deviation for mesenteric lymph node dimensions varied somewhat between the studies and was reported as 7\u00b76 \u00b12\u00b70 mm thick by 12\u00b76 \u00b12\u00b76 mm long and 5\u00b73 \u00b11\u00b739 mm thick by 10\u00b718 \u00b12\u00b736 mm long (Paul\u2010Murphy et al. 1999, Garcia et al. 2011).",

Anatomic landmarks for those lymph nodes were similar to that previously described in cats (Schreurs et al. 2008). Pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes were identified in 55%, splenic lymph nodes in 55%, gastric lymph nodes in 20% and hepatic lymph nodes in 5% of the 20 ferrets (Garcia et al. 2011). Lymph nodes were described as circular to elongate, hypoechoic structures surrounded by fat; some lymph nodes also had a faint echogenic halo. Length measurements (mean \u00b1standard deviation) for the pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes were reported as 5\u00b729 \u00b11\u00b732 mm, for the gastric lymph nodes as 7\u00b77 \u00b12\u00b76 mm, and for the splenic lymph nodes as 5\u00b793 \u00b11\u00b759 mm; thickness measurements were only provided for the mesenteric lymph node (Garcia et al. 2011).",

On ventrodorsal radiographs, the craniodorsal extremity was seen as a triangular soft\u2010tissue opaque structure in the left side of the abdomen along the body wall, caudal to the stomach and craniolateral to the left kidney, and partly summating with the stomach and left kidney. The spleen then variably extended caudally or caudomedially as a broad curvilinear to crescentic soft\u2010tissue structure. On lateral radiographic projections, the craniodorsal extremity of the spleen could be seen as a triangular soft\u2010tissue opaque structure in the craniodorsal abdomen, caudal to the gastric fundus. The spleen could then sometimes be seen extending caudoventrally in the mid\u2010abdomen as a broad, curvilinear soft\u2010tissue opaque structure summating with the intestines. On lateral radiographic projections, the spleen could be seen along the ventral abdomen in 21 out of 55 (38%) ferrets; in 4 out of 21 (19%) this was seen only on the right lateral projection and in 5 out of 21 (24%) only on the left lateral projection. The spleen was more frequently visible along the ventral abdomen in male ferrets (17 out of 21; 81% males) than female ferrets (4 out of 21; 19% females) and in sedated (16 out of 21; 76%) than non\u2010sedated (5 out of 21; 24%) ferrets.",

Lymph node thickness measurements are also graphically depicted in Fig 6. An average and SD of 9 \u00b12 lymph nodes (mode 10 lymph nodes; range 5 to 14 lymph nodes) were identified in each ferret. A single large jejunal lymph node was identified in all ferrets. All lymph nodes were oblong, with the exception of the single large jejunal lymph node which was U\u2010shaped or serpentine (Fig 3). Most lymph nodes were hypoechoic relative to the surrounding mesenteric fat with a more echogenic central hilus (Fig 3). Homogeneous lymph nodes were either hypoechoic or mildly hyperechoic. Heterogeneous lymph nodes were mildly heterogeneous and mildly hyperechoic. Several of the heterogeneous lymph nodes were predominantly hyperechoic with discontinuous hypoechoic marginal regions, not forming a complete hypoechoic rim. Anechoic cyst\u2010like regions (Fig 7) were identified in 31 out of a total of 492 lymph nodes (6.3%) evaluated, and were most frequently detected in the pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes (10 out of 31; 32\u00b73% of cystic lymph nodes) followed by the hepatic lymph nodes (5 out of 31; 16\u00b71% of cystic lymph nodes).
