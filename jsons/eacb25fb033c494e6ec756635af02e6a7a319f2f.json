Despite causing a primarily respiratory illness, cardiology patients and doctors will continue to be affected both directly and indirectly by the pandemic and its aftermath. Here we discuss the UK cardiological response to the pandemic in the provision of front-line care for COVID-19 patients, the re-design of clinical services, and the re-skilling of cardiologists. We describe how the pandemic might affect cardiology patients, how cardiologists can help COVID-19 patients, and how we can support our patients and colleagues during this difficult period. We will draw upon our personal experiences as cardiologists to contribute to the wider published discussion of how cardiology services are changing during this pandemic.",

The precise reasons for this are not clear but the presence of established cardiovascular disease or its associated risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking, age and male gender are all associated with worse outcomes (1). Although these are not all immunocompromising in the classical sense, it seems likely that they contribute to a state of immune dysregulation that predisposes to severe infection and an exaggerated maladaptive immune response (2) . Furthermore, patients with cardiac conditions such as heart failure, cardiomyopathy and ischaemic heart disease may lack the cardiovascular reserve to mount an appropriate physiological response to the virus.",

Furthermore, whilst COVID-19 can present with cardiac-sounding symptoms and has been associated with myocardial infarction this link also remains unproven. It is likely that in the absence of typical symptoms the frequent finding of a mildly elevated serum troponin level is secondary to demand ischaemia from hypoxaemia, sepsis, distributive shock and tachycardia rather than plaque rupture per se (1). Arrhythmias occur in 17% of patients (1). Cardiologists involved in the care of COVID-19 patients should be prepared to provide timely advice on the management of these cardiovascular complications and comorbidities.",

            "text": "In addition to the direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection the downstream effects on cardiac patients who avoid infection are likely to be significant but will be difficult to quantify. Cardiac doctors, nurses, physiologists and allied healthcare professionals all work with patients and are being affected by self-isolation and sickness. Reduced staffing levels and increasing healthcare demands are causing services to become overwhelmed. As a result, many outpatient clinics and elective procedures are being postponed; non-acute cardiac imaging has been reduced. The BCS published guidance to help clinical leadership teams scale down cardiology services appropriately and proportionately during the pandemic (3). It is recommended that emergency pathways for cardiac bypass surgery, percutaneous coronary revascularisation and cardiac electronic device implantation be maintained. However, this may require increased patient transfers, treatment delays and the requirement for less effective interim therapies such as thrombolysis for STEMI. Furthermore, delays in the urgent invasive management of cardiac conditions such as aortic stenosis and NSTE-ACS could indirectly contribute to downstream morbidity and mortality, even after the infection rate falls. Compounding these changes in healthcare provision, patients are choosing to avoid hospitals for fear of catching the virus. Yet unpublished data reveals a significant reduction in STEMI and NSTE-ACS admissions currently compared to this time last year. All of these deviations from established standards of care may negatively affect outcomes. It remains vital that patients who are unwell with cardiac-sounding symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations and syncope are still encouraged to seek medical attention. Furthermore, it must be carefully considered whether the harms of delaying guideline-based therapy for cardiac disease are appropriately balanced against the harms of COVID-19 itself, as neither group are more nor less deserving of effective healthcare than the other. One way that cardiologists can overcome the issue of reduced hospital attendance is to provide virtual or telephone outpatient consultations where feasible.",

Learning cardiac skills such as angiography, echocardiography and device implantation takes time and there is a risk this pandemic will generate de-skilling and opportunity costs. To this we would say three things. Firstly, training authorities have been sympathetic to our predicament; end of year assessments have already been modified accordingly. Secondly, we have found that the sacrifices made in contributing to this crisis are as rewarding as they are a privilege. Finally, it is possible that the unforeseen benefits outweigh these foreseen negatives; amongst healthcare professionals we are already seeing increased collaboration, a strengthened sense of community and a greater appreciation for our respective contributions.",

Many cardiologists have already transitioned from existing roles in sub-speciality rotas, research and training to front-line management of COVID-19 patients in medical or intensive care units. Many cardiologists dual train in internal medicine and are currently expanding their existing contributions in the acute medical take. Cardiologists offer 'hard' clinical skills such as the management of respiratory failure, sepsis, resuscitation and escalation planning, as well as 'soft' skills such as team leadership, rota management, communication, teaching and supervision. In critical care cardiologist's translatable skillsets include vascular access, transthoracic echocardiography and the management of unstable patients. The majority of critically unwell COVID-19 patients require arterial lines, central venous access, cardiovascular support and careful fluid balance management -all familiar areas for cardiologists. Some cardiologists may have already undertaken intensive care rotations, although up-skilling, retraining and supervised support will still be needed to assist with this transition. A subset of patients may also require transthoracic echocardiography, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation and anti-arrhythmic drugs.
