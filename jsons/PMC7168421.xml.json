In the present study, a new DNA construct, namely pET28a\u2010S450\u2013650\u2010CRT, encoding a fusion protein (rS450\u2013650\u2010CRT) between S450\u2013650 and murine CRT/39\u2013272 with a histidine tag was created. All three recombinant proteins were successfully expressed in E. coli. As illustrated in Figures 1a\u20131c, following IPTG induction rCRT/39\u2013272, a highly soluble polypeptide, was present in the lysate of E. coli cells harboring pET28a\u2010CRT/39\u2013272, whilst rS450\u2013650 was less soluble and mainly expressed in the inclusion bodies of pET28a\u2010S450\u2013650\u2010harboring bacteria.

However, there are other possible ways for it to enhance target Ag\u2010specific humoral lresponses in vivo. After all, adjuvants are typically characterized by their ability to activate professional APCs, such as DCs and macrophages, rather than B or T cells. Bone marrow\u2010derived mouse DCs were stimulated with rCRT/39\u2013272, or rS450\u2013650\u2010CRT, or LPS, or rEGFP for 24 hrs and then analyzed by flow cytometry for CD40 expression, which is regarded as a marker for DC maturation (17). As illustrated in Figure 5, the percentage of CD40+ cells of the groups treated with rCRT/39\u2013272 (24.5%) or rS450\u2013650\u2010CRT (18.6%) was considerably higher than that of the rEGFP control group (6.8%), thus confirming rCRT/39\u2013272 and rS450\u2013650\u2010CRT as potent activators of murine DCs. This is further supported by the fact that rS450\u2013650\u2010CRT as well as rCRT/39\u2013272, but not rEGFP, were able to induce production of IL\u201012 and IL\u20101\u03b2 by DCs in vitro (data not shown). The ability of rCRT/39\u2013272 and rS450\u2013650\u2010CRT to activate DC is not due to endotoxin contamination because the recombinant proteins used in this study were passed through polymyxin B agarose to remove endogenous LPS that could have come from the E. coli system.",

It is also of importance to mention that, in addition to its stimulatory effects on B cells and DCs, rCRT/39\u2013272 can also induce CD4 helper T cell responses in mice. In a previous study using draining lymph node cells from BALB/c mice after s.c. immunization with rCRT/39\u2013272, we were able to establish highly sensitive CRT\u2010specific CD4+ helper T cell lines (manuscript in preparation). Based upon the above observation, we propose that recombinant CRT may function as a molecular adjuvant through several different pathways that may result in synergistic effect in vivo. Firstly, APCs are known to express different receptors (e.g. CD14 and CD91) for CRT (18, 19, 20, 21); this would facilitate more efficient capture and uptake of CRT\u2010linked antigens. Secondly, soluble CRT directly activates DCs (Fig. 5) and macrophages (12), thereby leading to more efficient antigen processing and presentation. Thirdly, CRT in fusion proteins functions as a carrier protein and activates CD4+ helper T cells that are capable of providing cognate help for antigen\u2010specific B cells. Finally, the CRT portion of the fusion protein directly activates B cells and triggers their IgG class switching even in the absence of T cell help (Ref. 12 and Fig. 4). The genomes of many viruses (e.g. SARS\u2010CoV and influenza viruses) undergo substantial mutation, which can diminish T cell epitopes in the viral proteins, resulting in escape of the virus from immune detection by T lymphocytes (22, 23, 24). In this scenario, the ability of vaccines to induce IgG responses in hosts deficient in cognate helper T cells can be valuable.",

Previous investigators have observed increased concentrations of CRT\u2010specific serum IgG Abs in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (25, 26). However, it is unclear whether such Abs participate in the pathological damage to the host or function as part of the immunoregulatory network. When rCRT/39\u2013272 was employed to immunize different strains of mice, rats and rabbits, with or without Freund's adjuvant, high titer IgG Abs were obtained in these animals with no accompanying signs of autoimmune disorders (data not shown). In one experiment, BALB/c mice remained healthy for 6 months after four doses of s.c. immunization with rCRT/39\u2013272 (data not shown), arguing against the possibility that recombinant CRT causes autoimmune damage in vivo.",

Cheng and colleagues found that intradermal immunization with a DNA vaccine encoding a fusion protein between CRT, or CRT fragments, and the E7 tumor antigen was more efficient at eliciting E7\u2010specific CD8+ T cells and protecting against E7\u2010expressing tumors in C57BL/6 mice (13, 14). Park and coworkers prepared a DNA vaccine encoding a fusion protein between CRT and Bacillus anthracis protective antigen domain IV and showed that it much enhanced antibody responses to the target Ag (15). Kim and colleagues also demonstrated that a DNA vaccine encoding CRT linked to the N protein of the SARS\u2010CoV is capable of generating strong N\u2010specific humoral and cellular immunity (16). It should be noted, however, that proteins expressed by DNA vaccines may be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi after synthesis, thus limiting their ability to induce an antibody response. Moreover, intracellularly expressed CRT may not be as efficient as soluble extracellular CRT in exerting APC conditioning and in activating B cells in vivo.",

Unlike the S protein, which contains neutralizing epitopes, the N protein cannot induce neutralizing Abs in vivo because it is located inside the viral particles. On the other hand, the S, M and E proteins of SARS\u2010CoV play synergistic roles in viral infection (2) and Abs against these viral proteins are thought to have a synergistic effect in combating the infectivity of SARS\u2010CoV. Thus, a recombinant fusion polypeptide containing CRT/39\u2013272 and the major B cell epitopes in the S, M and E proteins of SARS\u2010CoV may comprise a more favorable vaccine design.",
