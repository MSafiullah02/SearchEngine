However, the pathophysiological role of platelets is much broader than regulation of hemostasis and thrombosis. Platelets are critical elements in linking and modulating thrombosis, inflammation, and tissue repair. Platelets are stimulated by a variety of agonists including thrombin or ADP and also by inflammatory agents such as antibodies, complement, bacteria, and others. Platelets contribute to inflammation by interacting with inflammatory cells via adhesion and secretion of prestored proinflammatory mediators. Thus, platelets are critical elements in the pathophysiology of inflammation and modulate significantly a variety of inflammatory diseases. A profound understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of platelet in inflammation may result in new therapeutic strategies in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.",

Under physiological conditions platelets circulate in the artery branch without interacting with each other or with structures of the intact vessel wall (1) . At the location of an endothelial disruption, subendothelial matrix proteins including collagen and von Willebrand factor (vWF) are exposed to circulating platelets that are recognized by specific platelet membrane receptors such as glycoprotein (GP)VI (2) or the plasma membrane complex GPIb-IX-V (3) (4) (5) . Once adherent to the subendothelium, platelets spread on the surface and release granule-stored components that recruit additional platelets to the arterial lesion. In addition, adhering platelets express the activated form of the fibrinogen receptor GPIIb-IIIa that mediates platelet aggregation through formation of fibrinogen bridges between two adjacent platelets (6, 7) (Fig. 1) .",

Integrins are ubiquitous and can be found on almost all cells including platelets. In addition to platelet aggregation and adhesion, integrins participate in tissue development and differentiation as well as in the growth of atherosclerotic plaques and vascular remodeling. Integrins are noncovalently linked heterodimers consisting of ~-and ~-subunits. They are subdivided on the basis of the 13-chain, which pairs with a specific o~-chain to form a functional receptor. To date 8 ~-and 14 ~-subunits have been identified (25) . subunit serves for the structural classification, and the o~-subunit determines the specificity. Integrins interact with numerous glycoproteins (e.g., collagen, fibronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, thrombospondin, vitronectin, and vWF) ( Table 2 ). These glycoproteins are components of the extracellular matrix, but they also occur in solution in plasma. The [31-and ~3-integrins recognize the arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) amino acid sequence. The RGD sequence is a component of numerous extracellular matrix proteins and is also found in fibrinogen molecules. Synthetic peptides exhibiting the RGD sequence and having similar molecular structures are competitive inhibitors of ligand binding to integrins. Five different integrins have been described so far on platelets, three of the [ GPIIb-IIIa (Oqibl33) belongs to the I]3-integrins and is specific for the platelet/megakaryocyte system. GPIIb-IIIa is the most frequently occurring membrane glycoprotein of blood platelets and is constitutively expressed on the surface membrane. A substantial portion of GPIIb-IIIa is also present in intracellular stores (m-granules and the open canalicular system) and can be translocated to the plasma membrane upon activation. The main task of GPIIb-IIIa is to bind fibrinogen to the activated platelet surface, which allows platelets to aggregate (homotype intercellular adhesion). Under physiological conditions, circulating platelets carry the resting, not activated GPIIb-IIIa complex on their surface (lowaffinity state) (27) . In the unactivated form, GPIIb-IIIa can only bind immobilized, but not soluble, fibrinogen. Platelet activation leads to a rapid change in the conformation of the GPIIb-IIIa complex and thereby to the exposure of high-affinity fibrinogen binding sites (high-affinity state) (27) . This allows binding of soluble fibrinogen to the platelet surface and initiates aggregation. Besides its role in platelet aggregation, GPIIb-IIIa mediates platelet adhesion to subendothelial matrix proteins (fibrinogen, vWF, vitronectin, and laminin). Additionally, the receptor interferes with endothelial cells (heterotype intercellular adhesion) via the formation of fibrinogen \"bridges\" between the platelet GPIIb-IIIa and the vitronectin receptor O~v133 expressed on the luminal aspect of endothelial cells (27) .",

The vitronectin receptor plays a role in angiogenesis, apoptosis, and proliferation (7, 28) . Inhibition of Ctv~ 3 by antagonists reduces the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells--mechanisms that participate in atherogenesis and intima proliferation. Ctv[~ 3 is also expressed on the luminal side of endothelial cells and mediates the adhesion of activated platelets to endothelial cells. Besides the two [33integrins, platelets possess three ~l-integrins that seem to regulate the primary adhesion of platelets to the subendothelial matrix of the injured vessel wall. However, the exact role of [31-integrins in hemostasis or thrombosis remains to be determined (7) .",

The main task of GPIb-IX-V is the adhesion of circulating platelets to vWF immobilized in collagen fibrils in spite of the significant shear forces that exist in regions of arterial flow. The GPIb-IX-V complex consists of four subunits. GPIbc~ (150 kDa) and GPIb~ (27 kDa) are covalently linked to each other by disulfide bridges. Each GPIb molecule binds noncovalently to a GPIX molecule at a ratio of 1:1. GPV (82 kDa) is the central unit of the receptor complex and is surrounded by two GPIb and two GPIX proteins linked noncovalently with one another. All subunits of the GPIb-IX-V complex exhibit leucine-rich regions, whose functions are mostly unknown. The GPIbt~ subunit is very significant for the receptor function. In the region of the extracellular domain, GPIbt~ possesses binding sites for vWF and thrombin. The cytoplasmic domain anchors GPIbt~ in the cytoskeleton. Recent data indicate that GPIbt~ on platelets is a potential counterreceptor for Mac-1 (29) . Furthermore, GPIbt~-associated vWF has also been proposed as a mediator of platelet-endothelium adhesion (30) . Selectins",

Three selectins have been described (31, 32) . E-selectin occurs on cytokine-activated endothelial cells and modulates granulocyte adhesion. Resting endothelial cells do not contain any E-selectin. L-selectin occurs constitutively on leukocytes, is shed from the leukocyte surface after activation, and participates in the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells (31, 32) . Pselectin is found in platelets and endothelial cells, where it is stored in thrombocytic t~-granules and endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies, respectively. P-selectin is not expressed on the surface of resting platelets or endothelial cells. However, activation leads to the rapid release and surface expression of P-selectin on both types of cells. Both endothelial P-selectin and P-selectin exposed on activated adhering platelets at sites of endothelial disruption mediate initial tethering and rolling of leukocytes through their P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) (33, 34) . P-selectin binding to leukocytes induces activation of Mac-1 and allows firm adhesion and transplatelet migration (34) .",

Thus, during the release reaction, prothrombotic constituents are liberated that recruit other platelets to adhere and aggregate. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) acts predominantly as a local vasoconstrictor and proinflammatory compound. Serotonin has been proposed to enhance the chemotactic responsiveness of human leukocytes (47) . Stimulation of monocytes through serotonin induces secretion of lymphocyte chemoattractant activity (interleukin-16 ) that may promote the recruitment of T lymphocytes into an inflammatory focus (48, 49) . Other dense-granule constituents (histamine, ATP) have been shown to support the proinflammatory reaction in the microenvironment of platelet adhesion (41) . t~-Granules m-Granules represent the major granule population in size and number (42) . The t~-granules are typical secretatory vesicles that carry proteins to the cell surface to be released. Some of the released intragranular proteins adhere to the platelet surface or become integrated into the plasma membrane, and some diffuse into the extracellular fluid (Table  3) . Two specific platelet proteins, [3-thromboglobulin (~-TG) and platelet factor-4 (PF-4) are localized in t~-granules together with proteoglycans (50) . The latter include a family of [3-TG-antigen molecules consisting of the platelet basic protein (PBP), connective tissueactivating protein-III (CTAP-III), and neutrophil-activating protein-2 (NAP-2), which are all precursors of ~-TG and PF-4. Purified PF-4 lacks Table 3 Platelet-Derived Vasoactive, Proinflammatory, and Mitogenic Constituents",

PAF is a phosphoglyceride generated from the phospholipids of cell membranes. PAF promotes leukocyte-endothelium interaction and favors diapedesis of leukocytes (61) .

Upon platelet activation TXA 2 is synthesized de novo from arachidonic acid through the action of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-l), an enzyme that is inhibited irreversibly by aspirin (62) . TXA2 is known to induce platelet aggregation at sites of platelet activation. In addition, the arachidonic acid metabolite acts as a potent proinflammatory mediator, inducing leukocyte adhesion to and migration across activated endothelial cells (62) . Another rich source of proinflammatory arachidonic acid metabolites is the platelet microparticles, membrane blebs that are shed from the surface of activated platelets by membrane vesiculation (63) . Platelet microparticles have been shown to increase the adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells in a time-and dose-dependent manner (63) . In line with this finding, microparticle-derived arachidonic acid enhanced the expression of ICAM-1 on resting endothelial cells and upregulated CD1 la/CD18 as well as CD1 lb/CD18 on monocytes.",

Thus are not required for platelet adhesion to the vascular wall. Adherent platelets release a variety of proinflammatory mediators and growth hormones and have the potential to modify signaling cascades in vascular cells, inducing the expression of endothelial adhesion receptors and the release of endothelial chemoattractants. In this manner they might regulate the adhesion and infiltration of leukocytes, in particular of monocytes, into the vascular wall, a process thought to play a key role in acute and chronic inflammation. Normal \"resting\" endothelium represents a nonadhesive and nonthrombogenic surface that prevents extravasation of circulating blood cells (66) . In contrast, activated endothelial cells are proadhesive and promote the adhesion of circulating blood platelets. Adhesion of platelets to the intact but activated endothelium in the absence of previous endothelial denudation involves a surface receptor-dependent process that allows \"capturing\" of circulating platelets toward the vessel wall even under high shear stress. Similar to the recruitment of leukocytes (65) , the adhesion of platelets to the vascular endothelial surface is a multistep process, in which platelets are tethered to the vascular wall, followed by platelet rolling and subsequent firm adhesion (Fig. 2) .",

The initial loose contact between circulating platelets and vascular endothelium (platelet rolling) is mediated by selectins, present on both endothelial cells and platelets (76) (77) (78) (79) (80) . P-selectin (CD62P) is rapidly expressed on the endothelial surface in response to inflammatory stimuli by translocating from membranes of storage granules (Weibel-Palade bodies) to the plasma membrane within seconds. Endothelial P-selectin has been demonstrated to mediate platelet rolling in both arterioles and venules in acute inflammatory processes (76, 79) . E-selectin, which is also expressed on inflamed endothelial cells, also allows a loose contact between platelets and endothelium in vivo (80) . In line with the concept of endothelial inflammation as a trigger for platelet accumulation, the process ofplatelet rolling does not require previous platelet activation, since platelets from mice lacking P-and/or E-selectin roll as efficiently as wild-type platelets (81) .",

On the other hand, these bonds have an intrinsically high dissociation rate and thus a limited half-life, which results in detachment at the tailing edge of platelets, where the tension is greatest, resulting in forward rotational movement (rolling) from torque imposed by the blood flow. However, because of their biophysical characteristics, selectin-ligand interactions are not sufficient to promote firm adhesion of platelets in the blood stream. This indicates that during rotational movement, new bonds, characterized by low dissociation rates, have to be formed that promote irreversible adhesion. These tighter interactions between platelets and the vascular wall involve the interplay of platelets and endothelial integrins as well as immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules.",

Among them, the vitronectin receptor (O~vl]3) appears to play a crucial role in promoting platelet adhesion. The vitronectin receptor is upregulated in response to endothelial cell activation, e.g., by IL-I~ or thrombin (16, 86) . Inhibition of av[33 attenuates platelet-endothelial cell interaction (16) . Hence, both platelet ~IIb~3 and endothelial C~v~ 3 are involved in mediating firm adhesion of platelets to the luminal aspect of activated endothelial cells. However, direct binding of Oqib~ 3 to endothelial C~v~3 has not been reported so far. In fact, heterotypic cell adhesion through ~nb~3 and Otvl] 3 requires the presence of fibrinogen, which bridges the platelet fibrinogen receptor to the endothelial vitronectin receptor (84) . Recent evidence suggests that this fibrinogen-dependent bridging mechanism rather than direct receptorligand interactions mediates firm platelet adhesion to the endothelium both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 3) (85) . The affinity of the platelet (Xiib~ 3 for its ligand underlies strict regulation and increases with platelet activation (inside out-integrin signaling; see p.120). Although even nonactivated ~IIb~3 can bind to immobilized fibrinogen, platelet activation during the initial contact between platelets and endothelial cells (platelet rolling), e.g., via GPIbo~-P-selectin interaction, might enhance the fibrinogen binding capacity of C~iib~3 and thereby facilitate subsequent firm platelet adhesion (30) . clonal antibody-reduced platelet adhesion to TNF-~-treated endothelial cells (Fig. 3) .",

These platelet-induced alterations of the endothelial phenotype support chemotaxis, adhesion, and transmigration of monocytes to the site of inflammation. Among the various platelet-derived proinflammatory proteins, IL-I[3 has been identified as a major mediator of platelet-induced activation of endothelial cells (57, 58) . The IL-1 [3 activity expressed by platelets appears to be associated with the platelet surface (57, 58) , and coincubation of endothelial cells with thrombin-activated platelets induces IL-1 [3-dependent secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 from endothelial cells. Furthermore, incubation of cultured endothelial cells with thrombin-stimulated platelets significantly enhances the secretion of endothelial monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in an IL-l[3-dependent manner (86, 91) . MCP-1 belongs to the CC family of chemokines and is thought to play a key role in the regulation of monocyte recruitment to inflamed tissue (91) .",

IL-ll3-dependent expression of early inflammatory genes, such as MCP-1 or ICAM-1, involves the activation of the transcription factor NF-~B.

Deposition of platelet RANTES induces monocyte recruitment mediated by P-selectin (96) . Furthermore, release of platelet-derived CD40 ligand induces inflammatory responses in endothelium. CD 154 (CD40L), a 30-33-kDa protein, belongs to the TNF family of cytokines, which includes TNF-c~ and Fas ligand. CD40L was originally thought to be restricted to CD4 + T lymphocytes, mast cells, and basophils. Henn et al. (46) showed that platelets store CD40L in high amounts and release CD40L within seconds following activation in vitro. Ligation of CD40 on endothelial cells by CD40L expressed on the surface of activated platelets increased the release of IL-8 and MCP-1, the principal chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes (46) . In addition, platelet CD40L enhanced the expression of endothelial adhesion receptors including E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and ICAM-1, all molecules that mediate the attachment of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes to the inflamed vessel wall. Moreover, CD40L induces endothelial tissue factor expression (97) . Hence, like ILl]], CD40L expressed on platelets induces endothelial cells to release chemokines and to express adhesion molecules, thereby generating signals for the recruitment of leukocytes in the process of inflammation.",

Moreover, adhesion of activated platelets to endothelial cells results in generation and secretion of MMP-9 and of the protease-activated receptor uPAR on cultured endothelium (99) . The endothelial release of MMP-9 was dependent on both the fibrinogen receptor GPIIb-IIIa and CD40L because inhibition of either mechanism resulted in reduction of platelet-induced matrix degradation activity of endothelial cells. Moreover, GPIIb-IIIa ligation results in substantial release of CD40L in the absence of any further platelet agonist (100) (Fig. 5) . These results suggest that the release of platelet-derived proinflammatory mediators like CD40L is dependent on GPIIb-IIIa-mediated adhesion. This mechanism may be pathophysiologically important for the localization of platelet-induced inflammation of the endothelium at a site of platelet-endothelium adhesion.",

Thus, leukocyte-bound platelets are known to enhance leukocyte adhesion molecule expression, superoxide anion generation, tissue factor expression, and cytokine synthesis (43, 44, 113, 114) . These effects seem to be closely regulated by intercellular signaling via adhesion molecule ligation. PSGL-1/Pselectin ligation induces a tyrosine-kinase-dependent signal, which upregulates Mac-1 expression and enhances ~2-integrin-dependent neutrophil adhesion to ICAM-1 (115) . P-selectin/PSGL-1 interaction markedly enhances tissue factor activity in monocytes, and PSGL-1 blockade can inhibit tissue factor expression (116, 117) . Furthermore, PSGL-1 engagement also mobilizes transcription factor NF-~B and induces cytokine expression in monocytes (43) . Signaling via [32-integrins is necessary for neutrophil oxidative bursts, and platelets conjugating to neutrophil ~2-integrin via fibrinogen upregulate neutrophil oxidative burst activity (118) . [32- integrin is also involved in the expression of ]31-integrins ((x4~ 1 and ~2~1), which are important in neutrophil adhesion and migration (119) (Fig. 7) .",

A number of proteins stored in platelet o~-granules have been shown to enhance leukocyte activation ( Table 2) . Platelets contain large amounts of two chemokines, PF-4 and ~-TG, which are stored in cz-granules. PF-4 is chemotactic for neutrophils and monocytes and can induce leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and degranulation via activation of leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) (120). ~-TG is the precursor of NAP-2, which stimulates neutrophil chemotaxis, adherence, calcium mobilization, and degranulation of lysosomes (120, 121) . It is interesting to note that neutrophil-derived cathepsin G is the principal enzyme cleaving [3thromboglobulin into NAP-2, and that this product then acts on neutrophils themselves (122) (123) (124) (125) . Platelet tx-granules also contain PDGF, which may enhance leukocyte adhesion, degranulation, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and tissue factor expression (126) (127) (128) .

Serotonin may enhance leukocyte rolling and adhesion by upregulating the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, such as Mac-1. Activated leukocytes generate PAF, which induces platelet aggregation, platelet adhesion to endothelial cells, and platelet secretion. Platelet-released chemokines, e.g., RANTES, have been reported to induce monocyte adhesion on endothelial cells (95) . Other soluble components released from platelet membranes may also activate leukocytes. For instance, soluble CD40L may bind to monocyte CD40 and promote tissue factor expression and cytokine/chemokine production (97, 99) .

Chronic endothelial injury and inflammation are key features in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (131) . Cardiovascular risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, smoking, and diabetes result in oxidative stress of the vascular wall, endothelial dysfunction, and platelet hyperactivity (131) . Atherosclerosis emerges locally and preferentially at lesion-prone sites (132) that are characterized by decreased shear stress because of nonlaminar, turbulent blood flow at branching vessels or curves. Normal arterial shear stress is atheroprotective, with high expression of nitric oxide synthetase and COX, whereas decreased shear stress is associated with an atherogenic endothelial phenotype, which expresses ICAM-1, MCP-1, and PDGF (132) .

Experimental evidence indicates that platelets might contribute significantly to the inflammatory processes that promote atherosclerotic lesion formation. Platelets can adhere directly to the intact endothelial monolayer even in the absence of endothelial disruption (135) . During adhesion platelets are activated and release proinflammatory cytokines and chemoattractants (such as IL-1 ~3, PF-4, and CD40 ligand). In vitro interactions between platelets and endothelial cells trigger the secretion of chemokines and the expression of adhesion molecules that promote the adhesion of leukocytes (Fig. 4) . In this manner, the adhesion of platelets to the endothelial surface might generate signals that lead to the recruitment and extravasation of monocytes during atherosclerotic plaque progression, a process of paramount importance for atherogenesis. Moreover, platelets have been found to alter substantially the pericellular proteolytic activity of endothelial cells (activation of metalloproteinases), resulting in extracellular matrix degradation and fibrous cap thinning of a vulnerable lesion (Fig. 5) (98) . Thus, in areas of platelet accumulation at lesion-prone sites, an enhanced release of platelet-derived proatherogenic compounds favors atherogenetic changes within the arterial wall and the development of atherosclerotic plaques.",

            "text": "Recently, the occurrence of platelet-derived proatherogenic compounds like PF-4 and NAP-2 in carotid plaques has been documented (136) . PF-4 is a potent chemotactic factor for peripheral blood monocytes and has been found to enhance markedly the uptake of oxLDL by macrophages, an important mechanism in the development of unstable atherosclerotic plaques (137) . Only recently was it shown that platelet adhesion to the arterial wall is enhanced during atherogenesis (17) . Platelet adhesion to endothelium coincides with inflammatory gene expression and precedes atherosclerotic plaque invasion by leukocytes. Prolonged blockade ofplatelet adhesion in mice deficient in apolipoprotein E profoundly reduced leukocyte accumulation in the arterial intima and attenuated atherosclerotic lesion formation in the carotid artery bifurcation, the aortic sinus, and the coronary arteries ( Fig. 8) (17) . Moreover, chronic platelet activation accelerates atherosclerosis (18) . Thus, platelet-induced inflammation of the vessel wall plays a major role in initiation of the atherogenetic process (Fig. 9) .",

Major advances have been achieved in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in platelet interaction with inflammatory cells. The interaction of platelets with leukocytes and endothelial cells results in substantial activation of these cell types that changes their chemotactic, adhesive and proteolytic properties significantly. Specific cell adhesion receptors such as selectins, immunoglobulin-type receptors, and integrins are involved in regulation of platelet adhesion with inflammatory cells. Therafter, release of platelet-dependent proinflammatory mediators substantially triggers the inflammatory response in the microenvironment of the site of platelet adhesion. Thus, platelet adhesion and subsequent release reaction are critical mechanisms involved in platelet-mediated inflammation and might represent targets for future therapeutic strategies in a variety of inflammatory diseases.",
