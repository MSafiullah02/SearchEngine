The developed system is flexible and allows intuitive creation and execution of different algorithms for an extensive range of advanced data analysis topics. Furthermore, we demonstrate a case study of association rule mining and ranking on road accident data.",

Our implementation will be opensource and a live demo can be found at https://youtu.be/QILaVUghlsM. Figure 1 shows our framework architecture which includes three main modules: data preprocessing, association rules mining, and multiple criteria analysis. Data preprocessing allows users to process and prepare data to be used by data mining algorithms to extract association rules based on some input thresholds (minimum support and minimum confidence). Afterward, we use multiple criteria analysis to rank the relevant rules based on user preferences and assign the result to different relevant categories. The system was implemented on R [7] and r shiny [9] , providing interactive and user-friendly interfaces for different modules. The system can be extended with new data sets on demand, rendering information retrieval and query linked data using SPARQL queries (data linkage).",

Summary tab shows the summary of rules mining algorithm, ScatterP lot tab shows the scatter-plot of extracted rules, F requentItemsets tab shows frequent itemsets from data, and the rest of tabs shows interactive techniques to visualize association rules. Figure 3 shows the association rules evaluation interface. The parameters configuration panel is displayed on the left side including method choice and the list of association rules with quality measurement. The main panel presents different steps for ELECTRE TRI (Eqs (1)-(3) ), afterward, user can move to the bottom panels and clicks 'Decision matrix' tab to see the performance table of association rules associated with predefined thresholds (Table 2 ) and quality measurement. Furthermore, user can move to other tabs for different computations and assign association rules to different categories (The set of categories to which the rules must be assigned to is completely ordered from the best to the worst), the rules in the first category will be the most relevant ones to user preferences (Table 1) . Association rules mining algorithms produce a large number of rules. It is, therefore, necessary to choose relevant ones according to the decision-makers' preferences and predefined thresholds p j , q j , v j . Based on this study, the integration of multiple criteria analysis within the association rules process performs well and produces relevant rules. After eliminating the rules users are not interested in, eleven significant rules were obtained in this case study (R1, R2, R5, R10, R15, R20, R30, R31, R15, R22, R13).",
