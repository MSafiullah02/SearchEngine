The risk of infection, for vulnerable hospital patients, their family members and healthcare professionals, increases during outbreaks of novel and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and pandemic influenza A [2]. Healthcare-associated transmission of these viral infections, into previously unaffected communities, was a key feature of the early stages of, for example, SARS in Toronto and MERS in Seoul [3,4]. A notable feature of both outbreaks was the high proportion of those affected who were healthcare workers, with reports of up to 27% and 57% for MERS and SARS, respectively [5]. First responders and emergency department (ED) clinicians are at high risk of exposure to both common and emerging communicable diseases of high consequence, as they are in close contact with symptomatic patients before a diagnosis is made [[5], [6], [7]]. For example, ED staff are among the highest-risk healthcare professionals for exposure to blood-borne viral infections [8] and respiratory diseases such as influenza [9]. Hunter et al. [10] reported an estimated 16% rate of MERS among ED clinicians in Abu Dhabi and, of those infected, 93% had been exposed before the diagnosis was made.",

In addition to appropriate use of PPE, as part of transmission-based precautions (contact, droplet or airborne), standard precautions indicate use of PPE when there is a risk of exposure to pathogens: non-sterile disposable gloves if hands are likely to become contaminated and a surgical mask and eye protection when at risk of exposure to aerosols or direct splash with blood and body fluids. N95/P2 masks are usually reserved for a few diseases (chickenpox, measles, tuberculosis) in which pathogen-contaminated droplet nuclei (residue from evaporated droplets) or dust particles can remain suspended in air for long periods and enter the upper and lower respiratory tracts.",

            "text": "There is limited recent literature examining the use of PPE in EDs. Following the introduction of universal precautions in the early 1990s [21], a number of studies reported poor compliance with these measures in the ED [[22], [23], [24]]. More recently, Singh et al. used self-administered questionnaires to determine compliance with (what are now referred to as) standard precautions in the ED, and found that gloves were frequently used, but there was poor compliance with other PPE, especially eye protection [15]. Evanoff et al. [25] observed video footage to assess compliance with PPE during 304 invasive procedures in an ED and reported 96% glove use for trauma patient encounters, compared with 68% and 78%, for use of mask and protective eyewear, respectively. In a trauma centre study, the compliance rates for use of masks and eye protection, after an educational intervention, were 16% and 44%, respectively [26]. ED clinicians are regularly at risk of facial contamination during invasive procedures, intubation and other resuscitative measures [27]. They are also exposed to both seasonal and emerging respiratory infectious diseases. In one paediatric ED setting, only 1\u201312% of clinicians reported that they always or usually wore a mask or eye protection, while assessing febrile respiratory patients during winter [28]. Although gloves are worn frequently, patient safety may be compromised by misuse, such as not changing them between dirty and clean tasks on the same patient or between different patients and/or failing to comply with hand hygiene before and after use, which often contaminates the clinician\u2019s hands [[29], [30], [31]]. Commonly cited factors contributing to sub-optimal compliance with PPE in healthcare include inadequate knowledge and training, perception of risk, organisational culture and environmental barriers [32,33]. Reid et al. [28] identified knowledge, access to PPE, patient diagnosis and unit culture, in the ED context, as factors influencing PPE compliance.",

While it is difficult to plan in advance for such a rare event, staff who are competent in the principles and practice of routine infection prevention and control (IPC) and PPE use are more likely to be better protected from the start and more prepared to implement high-level precautions rapidly and safely. In this area there is a paucity of literature which examines factors that facilitate or hinder the use of PPE during routine clinical care in the ED. Most previous studies have focused primarily on compliance with standard precautions during procedures that pose a high risk of exposure to blood and body fluids [25,26] or on overall compliance with PPE use, without elucidating determinants of those behaviours [15]. They have described \u2018how\u2019 clinicians use PPE, whereas the present study aimed to shown \u2018why\u2019 PPE is, or is not, used by exploring the factors that influence the use\u2014specifically of gloves and masks\u2014during routine care, in one ED. We employed methods that allowed close engagement with clinicians so as to understand their choices and behaviours and utilised the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) [34] to assess the relevant enablers and barriers. A better understanding of these practices in this context could assist managers, educators and clinicians to optimise enablers and address barriers, locally, and inform health policy and pandemic planning more widely.",

            "text": "Many participants blamed the chaotic, fast-paced ED environment, as a significant barrier to using a mask. While this argument has been reported previously [44], the same contextual reasoning could also apply to gloves, which are in fact regularly used and take longer to don and doff\u2014at least if hand hygiene is included. Thus, other factors may be more influential determinants of mask use, such as the team behavioural norms in the department or the individual\u2019s perception of risk of infectious diseases. One barrier to optimal mask use demonstrated in our research was the strong personal belief about PPE use of some senior medical staff, which overrode IPC policy. This is reflective of a recent study which found that the clinical autonomy of doctors was a significant factor in their IPC practice [47]. In an ED where there are numerous \u2018leaders\u2019, different role models and aberrant behaviour can impact negatively on the IPC culture of the department. Participants identified a lack of positive role modelling and leadership which has been shown elsewhere to influence individual behaviour towards PPE [26,47,48]. In contrast to our findings, a recent qualitative study that utilised focus groups with nurses and assistants, reported a positive peer culture for encouraging respirator mask use [49]. This may indicate a greater perception of risk associated with diseases that required an N95/P2 respirator mask. In our study, a clinician\u2019s reduced perception of risk of infection from facial exposure was a barrier to wearing a mask. Furthermore, clinicians perceived less risk to themselves when the patient was wearing a protective mask for a potential respiratory disease and felt protected enough not to wear a mask. Public Health guidelines recommend that symptomatic persons in hospital waiting rooms and other public spaces are given a mask to wear to prevent transmission of respiratory infection [50,51]. This measure is largely accepted by the public and has had some success in community settings [[52], [53], [54]]. However, research is limited on its protective effect for clinicians engaging in direct patient care. The literature also reports the problem of non-compliance with mask use by the public [55]. This risk may increase in the ED setting, where, as identified by participants in our study, patients are unwell and often non-compliant in correct mask use.",

This study identified the barriers to implementing effective protective mask use, which can be difficult in facilities with few isolation rooms or where staff rely on visual or verbal cues to instigate appropriate precautions [56]. In addition, the placement of boxes of masks was a practical barrier. Poor access to masks is also a common finding in the literature [44,57,58]. In our study setting the introduction of ten isolation equipment trolleys addressed some of these barriers. Applying human factors design principles is one method to address some of the contextual environmental barriers to optimal IPC behaviour such as difficult access to PPE [14,59].",

Although normally viewed as a facilitator, policy in this setting was viewed as a barrier to optimal mask and gloves use. Bouchoucha and Moor [60] suggest that deviating from IPC guidelines and policy can have serious consequences for patient safety. On the other hand, other authors have recognised that the unique complexity of an ED environment can challenge conventional IPC protocols and practices. For example, Liang states that over-crowding, multiple clinician-patient encounters, limited isolation facilities and other factors unique to an ED are barriers to good IPC practice [61]. Chen et al suggests that, compared to inpatient settings, it is more difficult to implement IPC measures in an emergency or outpatient department [62].",
