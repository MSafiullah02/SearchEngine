The emerging evidence for a role of CCR2 and CCR5 receptors in human inflammatory diseases led to a growing interest in CCR2-and CCR5-selective antagonists. In this review, we focus on the recent development of selective CCR2/CCR5 receptor ligands and dual antagonists. Several compounds targeting CCR2, e.g., INCB8761 and MK0812, were developed as promising candidates for clinical trials, but failed to show clinical efficacy as presumed from preclinical models. The role of CCR5 receptors as the second co-receptor for the HIV-host cell fusion led to the development of various CCR5-selective ligands. Maraviroc is the first CCR5-targeting drug for the treatment of HIV-1 infections on the market. The role of CCR5 receptors in the progression of inflammatory processes fueled the use of CCR5 antagonists for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Unfortunately, the use of maraviroc for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis failed due to its inefficacy. Some of the ligands, e.g., TAK-779 and TAK-652, were also found to be dual antagonists of CCR2 and CCR5 receptors. The fact that CCR2 and CCR5 receptor antagonists contribute to the treatment of inflammatory diseases renders the development of dual antagonists as promising novel therapeutic strategy.",

Because the chemokine receptors 2 (CCR2) and 5 (CCR5) represent highly interesting candidates of the chemokine receptor family, much of investigations have recently been carried out in the development of ligands for these receptors. Maraviroc (1) is the first and to date the only FDA-and EMEAapproved drug on the market, targeting the CCR5 receptor (see Fig. 1 ) [1, 2] . The intention of this review is to elucidate the structure activity relationships of various small-molecule CCR2 and CCR5 ligands. The focus will be on the receptor binding affinity, antiviral activity for the treatment of HIV, and chemotactic activity for the treatment of atherosclerosis. In addition to the receptor binding affinity, many further aspects, which play a crucial role in drug development, will be discussed, e.g., physicochemical properties, lipophilicity, and the affinity to the human Ether-\u00e0-go-go-Related Gene (hERG), a K + -channel which would lead to severe side effects induced by the compounds.",

The concerted action of the chemokine ligand CCL2 and the CCR2 receptor plays an important role in the recruitment of monocytes from the bone marrow into the arterial wall, which is known to be an early key step in atherosclerotic plaque formation. Lesions of the arterial endothelium are caused by mechanic injury or toxins and lead to migration of monocytes into the subendothelium that is mediated by adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors. In the artery wall, monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which develop to foam cells by taking up blood lipids [3] [4] [5] . Advanced plaques become unstable and can suddenly rupture. They expose their content to the blood, leading to platelet aggregation and occlusion of the blood vessel. Thrombosis, stroke, and myocardial infarction result as serious long-term complications. With regard to the increasing number of patients, the use of small-molecule CCR2 antagonists in atherosclerosis has attracted significant attention in the last years [6] . The CCR2 receptor is linked also to progression and development of other inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [7] .",

            "text": "The CCR5 and the CXCR4 receptors are mainly known as co-receptors required for the development of the HIV-1 infection [8] . The binding of gp120 of the virus to CD4 receptors on T-lymphocytes and macrophages leads to a conformational change of gp120 and enables the interaction with the CCR5 co-receptor. This triggers conformational changes in gp41, which leads to the fusion of the virus with the host cell [9] . At the beginning of an infection, the vast majority of the transmitted virus strains is M-or R5-tropic and uses the CCR5 receptor as a co-receptor. The T-or X4-tropic virus strains, which use the CXCR4 receptor as a co-receptor, are associated with an advanced disease progression [10] . A genetic polymorphism of the CCR5 receptor, characterized by a deletion of 32 bp in the gene segment encoding the receptor (CCR5\u039432 bp), results in a lack of function of the CCR5 receptor in homozygote individuals. These CCR5\u039432 bp mutations are found in 1-5% among uninfected Caucasian population and is exceedingly rare in infected patients (<0.1%), which indicates that CCR5\u039432 bp homozygotes are strongly resistant against HIV-1 infection [11] [12] [13] . The CCR5\u039432 bp mutant has also been linked to reduced susceptibility to coronary artery diseases and myocardial infarction [14, 15] . CCR5\u039432 bp polymorphism, as well as the function of the CCR5 receptor as a co-receptor for the HIV-host cell fusion, stimulated the beginning of several drug development programs by different pharmaceutical companies since the early 2000s.",

The aromatic moieties of a drug form \u03c0-\u03c0-stacking and hydrophobic interactions with the residues Phe656 and Tyr652 from the large cavity of the hERG channel [32] . The hERG gene encodes the \u03b1-subunit of the inwardly rectifying K + -channel, which is highly expressed in the human heart. This channel is involved in the repolarization of the cell. The mutation of the hERG gene or a channel blockade by drugs can lead to prolongation of the QT interval in the electrocardiogram in severe arrhythmia. High sensitivity of the hERG channel to a blockage by many drugs and with the resulting cardiovascular adverse events like torsades de pointes (TdP), which can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, led to the requirement of regulatory agencies that the effect of novel drugs on the hERG channel has to be investigated and reported [33] . Hence, considering hERG channel blockade is essential to improve cardiovascular safety of novel CCR2 antagonists. The increase of overall polarity of the drugs by introduction of hydrophilic ring systems and substituents on side 2 has been a successful strategy to eliminate hERG inhibition [31] . Further, successful approaches are the attenuation of the pK a value of the basic amine, modification of its steric environment, and the formation of zwitterions [32, 34] .",

Despite the fact that human and murine CCR2 receptors show high sequence homology, binding affinities of ligands differ considerably among species [36] . INCB3344 (2) showed the IC 50 values of 5.1 nM in hCCR2-binding and 3.8 nM in chemotaxis assay. 2 has been used as a tool in rodent in vivo efficacy models for multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and obesity and was effective in lowering macrophage levels in the targeted tissue [25, 26, 37] . Despite a high selectivity over other chemokine receptors, INCB3344 (2) was not a suitable clinical candidate due to its moderate hERG binding activity (IC 50 \u00bc 13 \u03bcM) and inhibition of CYP 3A4 [6, 35] . This data led to further structural modifications of 2. The removal of the ethoxy group at the quaternary carbon at position 3 of the pyrrolidine ring led to a loss of the mCCR2 affinity but retained the hCCR2 affinity. Previous SAR studies proved that the trifluoromethylphenyl residue on side 2 was crucial for the CCR2 binding affinity. The (R)-configuration at the position 3 of the pyrrolidine ring was also known to be important for the CCR2 affinity [38, 39] . The optimization involved the replacement of one phenyl ring by a heteroaromatic ring to reduce hydrophobicity (logP) as in INCB3284 (3). 3 includes a 6-methoxy-3-pyridyl moiety on side 1 and is a selective and potent CCR2 antagonist with IC 50 values of 3.7 nM in hCCR2 binding and 4.7 nM in chemotaxis assay. In contrast to INCB3344 (2), INCB3284 (3) was a substrate for CYP 3A4 and CYP 2D6, but had no inhibitory or inducing effects on the CYP system. The inhibition of the hERG-associated potassium channel was rather low (IC 50 \u00bc 84 \u03bcM) [35] . The balanced profile and safety data made INCB3284 (3) a promising candidate for phase I and phase II clinical trials, which were unfortunately terminated ahead of schedule [40] .",

Molecular modeling led to a new series of compounds, in which the contacts to the (R)-3-aminopyrrolidine as the main functional group on side 1 and 3-trifluoromethylbenzoyl aminoacetyl moiety on side 2 in the INCN3284 (3) series were reversed [39] . By analogy to the INCB3344 and INCB3284 series, the stereochemistry at the cyclohexyl ring required to be cis. Because previous studies demonstrated that the hydroxyl group and heteroaryl moiety at position 4 of the cyclohexyl ring led to weak hERG blockade and low intrinsic clearance, both structural elements were retained. The 6-methoxy-3-pyridyl moiety, previously present in the lead compound 3, was replaced by a (pyrimidin-2-yl)-pyridin-2-yl residue in the potent analog INCB8761 (4) (IC 50 \u00bc 5.2 nM). Compound 4 demonstrated no significant inhibition of other chemokine receptors or any influence on the CYP system. In contrast to the INCB3284 series, (S)-configuration in position 3 of the pyrrolidine ring is preferred over the (R)-enantiomer [27, 39] .",

The development of PF-4254196 (9) started with modifications of the spacer length between the cyclopentane carboxamide and the trifluoromethyl containing aryl residues in existing series of CCR2 ligands. Prior compounds included a trifluoromethyl-substituted pyridine but showed a significant hERG inhibition. To eliminate the cardiovascular risk modifications of both, the side 1 tetrahydropyran ring and side 2 heterocycle were explored. Based on former SAR studies, a substitution of side 2 with more polar and/or potential \u03c0-\u03c0-stacking residues was expected to be well tolerated [34] . The introduction of a pyridazine ring led to PF-4254196 (9), which displayed a significantly better CCR2/hERG index and selectivity than the corresponding pyridine-containing compound. Pyridine-based compounds were also reported to be dual CCR2 and CCR5 antagonists [38] . Further modifications led to a methano-bridged piperazine derivative 10 (2,5-diazobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane).

Another important aspect is the hydrogen binding potential of the urethane moiety and the restriction to small substituents at the benzoxazine heterocycle. SAR studies led to RS504393 (12) (IC 50 \u00bc 89 nM) as the most affine compound of this benzoxazine class. The SARs of spiropiperidines were extensively investigated. In these spirobenzoxazine systems, the position 4 of the piperidine is disubstituted by a spiro-phenyl urethane system.

The quaternary ammonium moiety of these compounds is expected to form an ionic interaction with Glu291 in the binding pocket of the CCR2 receptor [27] . Developments of these types of CCR2 antagonists started from TAK-779 (15, see also Sect. 3.1), first developed as a CCR5 antagonist and later found to have also significant CCR2 affinity (IC 50 \u00bc 27 nM) [40, 52] . Compounds 16 and 17, both showing promising binding affinities in a 125 I-labeled CCL2 assay using a THP-1 cell line, resulted from the systematic modifications of side 2 in 15 [53] . JNJ171668 (16) , developed by Johnson&Johnson, is a potent candidate with a binding affinity of 20 nM. In line with its quaternary ammonium structure, JNJ171668 (16) had poor oral bioavailability, but entered clinical trials for the treatment of allergic rhinitis as a nasal application [40] . The 3,4-dichloro phenyl ring of 16 led to higher binding affinity at the CCR2 receptor than its analogs with other substitution patterns. From a series of different biphenyl-containing compounds, it was evident that the presence of a chloro or bromo group leads to improved binding affinities compared to electrondonating (OMe, Me) and electron-withdrawing groups (CN, CF 3 ). Structural modifications on the side 2 were also found to be responsible for selectivity related to the interactions with the CCR2 and CCR5 receptor. A different modification on side 2 led to compound 17 with a linker L2 consisting of 9 carbon atoms. 17 contains a biphenyl moiety attached to the 3-position of acrylamide displaying the binding affinity of 10 nM [53] . In comparison with the pharmacophore model, the linker L1 is missing in 15, 16, and 17, whereas R1 is represented by a tetrahydropyran moiety.",

In order to eliminate the zwitterionic character of a piperidine-based amino acid derivative developed by Johnson&Johnson and to increase solubility, a cyclohexylazetidine system was prepared first [31, 55] . Different six-and five-membered heterocycles were introduced in the 4-position of the cyclohexane ring, which reduced the hERG channel activity. Finally, the thiazole derivative 19 was identified as the most potent candidate. A cis orientation of the thiazolyl and the azetidinyl substituents on the cyclohexane ring was found to be essential for the high CCR2 binding affinity [55] . Compound 19 revealed an IC 50 value of 37 nM in the CCR2 binding assay and did not interact with the hERG channel (IC 50 > 50 \u03bcM). A promising cardiovascular safety profile was confirmed in an anesthetized dog safety study. A high selectivity against other chemokine receptors was found, but the pharmacological profile remains to be reported [56] . In 2013, further variations of the heteroaromatic substituents at the N-acylglycine moiety were published, which started from 19 as a lead compound. Although various compounds with the high CCR2 affinity, promising functional activity and low hERG channel affinity were identified, none of these compounds displayed a promising pharmacokinetic profile [57] .",

The biaryl system on the other site is fixed between the hydroxyphenyl moieties of Tyr120 and Tyr259 and to a lesser extent by His121 via \u03c0-\u03c0-stacking interactions. His121 also interacts with Arg206 (TM 5), which results in a weaker ligandhistidine interaction. In the CCR5 receptor, His121 is replaced by phenylalanine (see Fig. 5 ), which cannot form interaction with arginine and therefore adopts an alternative rotameric conformation increasing the \u03c0-\u03c0-interactions.

There are various CCR5 antagonists reported in the literature so far. The CCR5 receptor ligand maraviroc (1, Celsentri \u00ae , UK-427,827) ( Fig. 1 ) developed by Pfizer is the only CCR5 ligand approved for the treatment of confirmed R5-tropic HIV-1 infection by the FDA and EMEA [2] . On account of this, many further investigations have already been undertaken, starting from maraviroc (1) as a lead compound. The intention of this chapter is to summarize the SARs of various CCR5 antagonists focusing on CCR5 antagonists derived from TAK compounds (Takeda), maraviroc, and related tropane-based CCR5 ligands. Several different aspects such as antiviral activity, CYP inhibition, leading to several drug-drug interactions and severe adverse effects will be discussed [65, 66] . Inhibition of the hERG K + -channel is a common challenge in developing CCR5 selective ligands due to the basic amine, which is required for the interaction with Glu283 of CCR5 receptor [29, 65, 66] . Therefore, the affinity to the hERG K + -channel [67] and the oral bioavailability, which significantly influence the CCR5 ligand development, will be discussed.",

One way to inhibit HIV-1 replication is to prevent the viral entry into the target cell. The potential of this approach is shown by T20, a peptide that prevents the conformational change in the viral glycoprotein gp41 that drives membrane fusion [68] . Therefore, Takeda has designed several compounds which were based on hits of a high-throughput screening (HTS). The most promising compound resulting from these hits was TAK-779 (15) (Fig. 4) . TAK-779 (15) antagonizes the binding of CCL5 to CCR5-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells completely at a concentration of 100 nM and showed an IC 50 value of 1.4 nM. Moreover, 15 was shown to block membrane fusion of HIV-1 at nanomolar concentrations. The binding of CCL3 and CCL4 to the CCR5-expressing cells was also blocked with IC 50 values around 1.0 nM. Although TAK-779 inhibited the binding of [ 125 I]-CCL2 to CCR2 in CHO/CCR2 cells, its IC 50 value for CCR2 receptor (IC 50 \u00bc 25 nM) was approximately 20-fold higher than that for CCR5 receptor [52] . The sequence homology between CCR5 and CCR2 receptors is 76% [69] , which might explain the dual antagonistic character.",

Strong hydrophobic interaction between the p-tolyl group and Ile198 on TM5 accompanied by some weaker interactions of 15 with Thr195, Ile198, Phe109, Trp248, and Tyr251 were also found.

The tertiary amine 21, derived from TAK-779 by removing one CH 3 group, resulted in decrease of CCR5 affinity but increased oral bioavailability. In order to enhance the CCR5, affinity modifications of the [7] annulene ring were undertaken [72] . The exchange at the 5-CH 2 -moiety of the benzo [7] annulene of TAK-779 (15) by a S-atom (22) did not significantly increase CCR5 receptor affinity [73] . The introduction of a sulfoxide (23) or a sulfone (24) led to a slightly increased affinity [74] . The exchange of the 5-CH 2 -group by an O-atom resulted in the benzoxepine 25 with high CCR5 affinity, which could not be retained in the tertiary amine 26. The highest affinity of the tertiary amines was found for the 1-methyl-1-benzazepine 27 (IC 50 \u00bc 130 nM) [72] . Because the compounds 24 and 27 possess high oral bioavailability (>50%) in rats [73] , further variations of the benzothiepine-1,1-dioxide and the 1-benzazepine cores were envisaged (Table 7) . In order to enhance the CCR5 receptor affinity, modifications of the p-methyl group of 24 were investigated ( Table 8 ). Replacement of the methyl group by an ethyl substituent (28) led to a 3-fold increased CCR5 receptor affinity, which was further increased by introduction of alkoxy groups (compounds 29 and 30) [75] . The butoxyethoxy derivative 30 was chosen for further optimization. The combination of the butoxyethoxy group with a 1-benzazepine scaffold led to the next series of CCR5 antagonists. Homologation of the N-methyl group to an N ethyl group (31) resulted in an increased CCR5 affinity, but low inhibition of HIV-1 envelope-mediated membrane fusion ( Table 9 ). Introduction of propyl (32), isobutyl (33) , benzyl (35) , and methylpyrazolyl (36) residues increased the inhibitory activity, whereas the cyclopropylmethyl group (34) resulted in a remarkable drop of inhibitory activity [75] .

The propandiamine substructure has become an important pharmacophore element for the development of CCR5 antagonists (Table 12 ). The HTS of the Takeda's compound library led to the discovery of N-(piperidinopropyl)carboxamide 46 with low micromolar CCR5 binding affinity. Subsequent optimization resulted in a series of piperidine-4-carboxamides, exemplified by 47, which had low nanomolar affinity for CCR5 receptors and exhibited high anti-HIV-1 activity [77] . The fast metabolism of 47 stimulated further optimization, which led to the most promising derivative 48 (TAK-220) of this new series (Table 12) . It demonstrated high inhibition of the [ 125 I]-CCL5 binding to CCR5expressing CHO cells (IC 50 \u00bc 3.5 nM), high inhibition for HIV-1 membrane fusion (IC 50 \u00bc 0.42 nM), and also high metabolic stability upon incubation with human hepatic microsomes [78] . A comparison of binding affinities and antiviral activity of TAK-779 (15), TAK-652 (43) , and TAK-220 (48) is summarized in Table 13 . The conformational flexibility of TAK-220 is higher than that of TAK-779 due to the higher number of rotatable bonds. Docking into a 3-D homology model of the CCR5 receptor showed that TAK-220 forms a strong salt bridge with Glu283. Mutagenesis studies indicated that the residues Trp86, Tyr108, Trp248, Tyr251, and Met287 (see Fig. 5 ) are important for TAK-779 binding, but have little effects on TAK-220 binding. However the hydrophobic interaction of TAK-220 with Ile198 is as strong as in case of TAK-779 binding (Fig. 6) . The 3-chloro-4methylphenyl group of TAK-220 is placed in the similar region within the helical bundle between Phe109, Trp248, and Tyr251 as the phenyl group of maraviroc (1) [63, 79] . ",

AstraZeneca's screen resulted in two closely related hits, 49 and 50, and Pfizer's screen in the hits 51 (UK-107,543) and 52 (Table 14) . AstraZeneca's approach focused on the development of CCR5-selective antagonists for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis [81] and inflammatory bowel disease [82] . Compounds 49 and 50 demonstrated similar CCR5 binding affinities in low micromolar range, indicating no advantage of the cyclized N-substituent of 49. The SAR investigations, in which the substituent R 2 of the acyl group was varied, revealed that neither (hetero)aromatic nor aliphatic groups increased the CCR5 receptor affinity (Table 15 ). The phenylacetyl derivative 53 was the only compound with potency in the high sub-micromolar range. Introduction of substituents at the oand m-position of the phenylacetyl group did not significantly affect the binding affinity. However, an increase in affinity was observed after introduction of polar electron-withdrawing substituents in p-position. In particular, sulfamoyl (55) , N,N-dimethylsulfamoyl (56, 57) , and methylsulfonyl (58) groups showed nanomolar CCR5 affinities. Replacing the methyl (56) with the ethyl group (57) at the amide N-atom slightly increased the CCR5 affinity (Table 15 ). Replacement of the amide substructure by a sulfonamide moiety was shown to be detrimental, whereas the introduction of a urea moiety instead of the amide retained the CCR5 affinity.

Introduction of one 60 or two 59 fluorine atoms into the p-position of the phenyl rings resulted in decreased CCR5 affinity. In contrast, one chlorine atom in p-position (61) was highly beneficial. Therefore, further substituents in p-position of one Compounds with strongly electron-withdrawing substituents such as trifluoromethyl (62), cyano (64) , and methylsulfonyl (66) were highly potent, but also the methoxy derivative 65 demonstrated high CCR5 affinity (Table 16) . Electronic effects alone are not sufficient to explain the SAR. The weakly potent difluoro (59) and 4-fluoro (60) compounds as well as the methylsulfonyl (66) derivative demonstrated sufficient metabolic stability and a good pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. The potential of the fluorine atoms to reduce oxidative metabolism on the phenyl rings of the diphenylpropyl moiety indicated a possible approach to improve oral bioavailability in this series of CCR5 ligands [47] . The (S)-enantiomer of the methylsulfonyl derivative (S)-66 was found to be twice as potent as the racemate 66. Moreover the enantioselective synthesis of (S)-66 was used to prepare several analogs with various substituents at the second phenyl ring. Since fluorine atom in p-position of the second phenyl moiety led to dramatic loss of the CCR5 affinity, the m-position was addressed for the introduction of the fluoro substituent (67). 67 displayed increased CCR5 affinity, but also fast clearance and short half-life. This could be improved by introduction of halogen atoms at both m-positions (Table 17 ). The 3,5-difluoro (69), 3-fluoro (67), and 5-chloro (68) analogs showed favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. The 3,5-difluoro derivative 69 displayed no affinity towards CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CXCR1, and CXCR2 receptors and other human G-protein-coupled receptors (human M 1 , M 2 , and 5-HT 2A receptor).

SAR investigation clearly indicated the requirement of one phenyl substituent, whereas the replacement of the second phenyl ring by other substituents was tolerated. Introduction of a piperazine and C-atom-linked piperidine ring led to compounds with reduced lipophilicity, promising CCR5 affinity and decreased hERG ion channel binding (Table 18 ) [83] . The piperazine derivative 71 showed only moderate bioavailability in dogs and very fast plasma clearance in rats, whereas the C-linked piperidine with the methylsulfonyl substituent at the N-atom demonstrated good bioavailability in both species with high selectivity over CYP 1A1, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 enzymes. Therefore 72 (AZD5672) was selected as drug candidate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The development of AZD5672 (72) was terminated in a phase IIb study with RA [84, 85] . Compounds 51 and 52 showed weak CCR5 binding affinity, antiviral activity could not be detected, and, moreover, high affinity to the CYP 2D6 enzyme was found (Tables 14 and 19 ) [80] .",

In order to increase the polarity, one of the phenyl groups of the diphenylmethyl moiety was replaced by an amide bearing substructure already found in compound 52. Amides 74-77 inhibited the CCL4 binding but, more interestingly, moderate levels of antiviral activity determined against HIV-Bal in PM-1 cells [80, 86] were found (Table 19 ). The benzamide 75, the isobutyramide 76, and the cyclobutanecarboxamide 77 were found to be the most active antiviral compounds in this series. The data of CCL4 inhibition and antiviral activity do not correlate, indicating that the binding domains of HIV gp120 and CCL4 are distinct and separate. In order to determine the eutomers within the amide series, the benzamide 75 and the cyclobutanecarboxamide 77 were synthesized stereoselectively. The (S)-enantiomers (S)-75 and (S)-77 had higher CCR5 affinity and antiviral activity than the (R)-enantiomers.

In the oxagranatane exo-80 (Table 20) , the basicity of the central amino group is reduced to pK a 6.0 compared to pK a 7.8 of exo-78. However, the hERG channel affinity was not reduced, which suggested that the basic center itself is not essential for hERG binding [90] . Docking of 78 into a hERG channel model indicated a lipophilic interaction of the phenyl ring of the benzimidazole moiety with the hERG channel residues. In order to inhibit this overlap, a triazole moiety (84) instead of the benzimidazole ring (78) was introduced, which dramatically decreased the hERG affinity. The introduction of an isopropyl side chain at the triazole motif (85) increased the antiviral activity, but the added lipophilicity increased the affinity to the hERG ion channel as well. The cyclobutyl group of the amide 78 was shown to overlap nicely with the lipophilic binding pocket of the hERG channel. In order to interrupt this interaction, polar fluorinated groups were introduced (86, 1). The 4,4-difluorocyclohexyl derivative 1 does not show any binding to the hERG channel, even at a concentration of 1,000 nM. Combined with low nanomolar antiviral potency (Table 22 ) [89] , a broad anti-R5 HIV-1 spectrum and no inhibition of CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, and 2D6 enzymes compound 1 were characterized as an inverse agonist of CCR5 receptors, stabilizing the receptor in the inactive conformation [91] . Maraviroc (1, UK-427,857) was the product of a long optimization process leading to the first CCR5 ligand approved for the treatment of confirmed R5-tropic HIV-1 infection on the market [2] . The use of maraviroc for the HIV-1 therapy is currently complicated by the growing number of maraviroc-resistant HI-virus strains (MVC RES ) [92] [93] [94] , which makes the ligands with an improved resistance profile desirable.",

The tropane N-atom is protonated and forms a salt bridge with Glu283. The NH moiety of the amide forms a hydrogen bond with the phenolic group of Tyr251 (Fig. 7) . The length of the propyl chain between the two N-atoms correlates with the positions of Glu283 and Tyr251 in the receptor. The fluorine atoms in the cyclohexane ring form two hydrogen bonds with Thr195 and Thr245. The phenyl group interacts with five aromatic residues, Tyr108, Phe109, Phe112, Trp248, and Tyr 251 in the binding pocket. The interaction of the benzene ring with Trp248 is believed to prevent the activation-related motion of the receptor, which underlines the inverse agonist character of maraviroc (see Fig. 7 ) [95] . Compared to the CXCR4/IT1t structure [30] , the binding site of maraviroc (1) was found to be deeper, without any contact to extracellular loops. The availability of the X-ray crystal structure of the CCR5 receptor will help to promote the development of novel potent CCR5 ligands with optimized properties.

The structure of PF-232798 (90c) resulted from an alternative approach which intended to circumvent the CYP 2D6 and hERG activity of the HTS lead UK-107,543 (51) . The introduction of the tropane substructure instead of the piperidine moiety was previously proven to reduce CYP inhibition [1] and was therefore incorporated into the new lead compound. The lipophilic imidazopyridine and benzimidazole substructures of 51 and 78 were shown to be responsible for the inhibition of CYP 2D6 and high hERG binding [80] . In order to prevent lipophilic interactions with the hERG ion channel, the imidazopyridine substructure was replaced by more polar 1,4,6,7-tetrahydro-imidazo [4,5-c] pyridine, which led to the 3-substituted (89a-c) and 1-substituted (90a-d) series of compounds. The methyl carbamates 89a and 89b demonstrated high hERG inhibition. Reducing the size of the amide substituent to an acetyl group (89c) significantly increased the selectivity for hERG ion channel within the series 89. Also the hERG affinity was reduced by incorporation of a m-fluoro substituent into the phenyl ring (89b). Switching the substitution position of the 1,4,6,7-tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine slightly improved the gp160 inhibition from 89c to 90a, but was detrimental in terms of hERG binding. The lowest hERG inhibition (IC 50 \u00bc 12 \u03bcM) could be achieved by introduction of an isopropoxycarbonyl substituent 90c (Table 24) . Compound 90c demonstrated complete oral absorption in rat and dog that was accompanied by improved metabolic stability compared to maraviroc (1) and other compounds in this series. Moreover, PF-232798 (90c) displayed antiviral activity against maraviroc-resistant viruses and was therefore chosen as the follow-up clinical candidate of maraviroc (1) [98] .",

The tropane-core represents the central structural motif of all previously successfully developed CCR5 ligands. The key features of the tropane moiety are an increased steric hindrance around the basic amino group and restricted conformational flexibility of the molecule. In order to retain the steric Table 24 3-substituted (89a-c) and 1-substituted (90a-d) 1,4,6,7-tetrahydro-imidazo [4,5-c] pyridines hindrance, the introduction of an additional methyl moiety into the propyl chain was envisaged. Several heterocycles as well as different amido substituents were screened for their antiviral activity, oral bioavailability, and low propensity towards hERG ion channel inhibition and interaction with a range of CYP enzymes. A large series of piperidines 91-94, substituted with a N-heterocycle, bearing an \u03b1-methyl moiety were prepared (Table 25 ) [101, 102] . The cyclobutyl derivate 91 reveals high antiviral activity combined with the low hERG inhibition. Introduction of two additional fluorine atoms at the alkyl substituent (92) was shown to be beneficial in terms of antiviral activity, as it was already observed during the optimization of maraviroc [89] . Increasing the size of the alkyl substituent to a cyclohexyl group (93) channel leading to an affinity higher than 10 \u03bcM. Enantioselective synthesis of 93 allowed the determination of (R)-93 as eutomer, with a 100-fold higher antiviral activity than the (S)-enantiomer. Bioisosteric replacement of the 1,3,4-triazolyl residue of (R)-93 by a 1,2,4-triazol-1-yl ring in (R)-94 resulted in a highly metabolically stable and potent CCR5 ligand. The 1,2,4-triazole (R)-94 displays excellent whole-cell antiviral activity (IC 90 \u00bc 2.6 nM), complete oral absorption in rat, and does not inhibit human CYP 1A2, 2C9, and 2D6 enzymes. Moderate affinity towards CYP 3A4 (IC 50 \u00bc 3.4 \u03bcM) was also found [101, 102] . Therefore, compound (R)-94 represents the new lead compound for the development of novel CCR5 ligands with new resistance profile.",

Unfortunately, 95 and 96 showed also moderate hERG affinity of IC 50 of 2 \u03bcM and 10 nM, respectively, which required further optimization [103] . The optimization focused on the substitution pattern of the phenyl rings, which led to the discovery of several potent CCR5 ligands with decreased inhibition of hERG. Introduction of a sulfonamide and two halogen substituents at the phenyl ring (97) turned out to decrease hERG affinity and retained antiviral activity. The exchange of the positions of the fluoro and chloro atoms from 97 to 98 decreased the antiviral activity. The reverse sulfonamide 100 is less hydrophobic than the forward sulfonamide 99 and was found to be very potent in anti-HIV assays (Table 27 ) [104] . However, compound 99 (GSK163929) was favored for further investigation as a clinical candidate, due to the potential aniline metabolite formation from reverse sulfonamide 100. GSK163929 (99) revealed high oral bioavailability and good pharmacokinetic profile in rats and dogs. Seven-day safety studies in both species did not show any adverse effects at therapeutic doses. The high antiviral activity, favorable pharmacokinetic profile, and safety data support further development of 99 in phase I clinical studies [104] .",

However, the increasing number of maraviroc-resistant HI-virus strains makes the development of ligands with a distinct resistance profile highly desirable [93] . The role of CCR5 receptors in the development and progression of inflammatory diseases led to an increased interest of using CCR5 antagonists for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [106] . Unfortunately, the use of 1 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis failed due to low efficacy [107] . The reasons for this failure remain to be elucidated.",

The chemokine system is very complex, and the CCR2 receptor binds multiple endogenous ligands including CCL2, which binds exclusively to the CCR2 receptor, as well as CCL8, CCL7, and CCL13 [109] which are rather unselective. The CCR2 receptor is abundantly expressed on blood monocytes and regulates their migration from the bone marrow into inflamed tissue, whereas the CCR5 receptor is expressed on macrophages. The in vivo function of the CCR5 receptor is less well defined than that of the CCR2 receptor, but has been shown to be related to the activation, survival, and retention of macrophages in the core of inflammation and is associated with Th1 cell recruitment and activation. The CCR5 receptor also binds various ligands, including CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL8, and CCL3L1. CCL4 and CCL3 are known to be selective for the CCR5 receptor. During the differentiation of monocytes, a reciprocal pattern of expression and function of the CCR2 and CCR5 receptor was observed, showing a downregulation of CCR2 and an upregulation of the CCR5 receptor expression [110, 111] . CCR2 and CCR5 receptors are expressed on different cells but in a complementary manner. Both receptors are important in the mediation of leukocyte trafficking in case of inflammation, e.g., during the pathogenesis of cardiovascular (atherosclerosis) and immunological diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's 226 A. Junker et al.",

PS433540 appears to be successful as antihypertensive in rats and reached phase IIa clinical trials.

Comparative analysis revealed 66 % sequence identity in general between CCR2 and CCR5 receptors and 82 % identity in the active site. Receptor homology modeling studies predicted a ligand binding pocket of the CCR2 receptor formed by TM2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. In the CCR5 receptor TM1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 form the binding pocket for CCR5 inhibitors, which is located at the extracellular region and is partly covered by the extracellular loop. Both CCR2 and CCR5 receptors possess glutamic acid in the anchor site in TM 7, Glu291 in CCR2 receptors, and Glu283 in CCR5 receptors. Glu291/Glu283 is essential for the interaction with protonated tertiary amines or quaternary ammonium ions.

Using computational calculations, low-energy three-dimensional receptor conformations of human CCR2 and CCR5 receptors were created, and the binding sites of 15 within the CCR2 and CCR5 receptor were predicted. Mutation experiments in which single amino acids were replaced within the receptor structure were performed, and after transient expression in the L1.2 cells chemotactic and competitive binding experiments to CCR2 and CCR5 receptors were carried out. Based on these data, it was postulated that Trp98/Thr292 in the CCR2 receptor (Fig. 3) and Trp86/Tyr108 in the CCR5 receptor (Fig. 5 ) were significantly associated with the efficacy of TAK-779. His121 in the CCR2 receptor was also important for antagonistic efficacy and was replaced by Tyr108 in the CCR5 receptor. An altered rotational orientation of TM3 is responsible for a different positioning of these aromatic residues in both CCR2 and CCR5 receptors. A comparison of quaternary ammonium salt TAK-779 (15) with antagonists including a tertiary amine showed differences in binding of these interacting residues. Depending on Glu291 in the CCR2 receptor and Glu283 in the CCR5 receptor facing either TM1 and TM2 or TM3 and TM6, different orientations of TM7 are possible: The first receptor conformation leads to a receptor activation network formed between TM 1, 2, 3, and 7, which is supposed to be required for the receptor activation by the chemokine. The second conformation is expected to be stabilized by antagonist binding [62] . The interaction of TAK-779 (15) with the respective binding sites of CCR2 and CCR5 receptors resulted in IC 50 values of 27 nM for the CCR2 receptor and 1.4 nM for the CCR5 receptor. 15 also inhibited the binding of CCL3 and CCL4 to the cells expressing the CCR5 receptor with an IC 50 value of 1.0 nM. No interaction was found between TAK-779 and CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, or CXCR4 receptors [71] .",

The development of 106 started from a potent CCR2 antagonist with an indolylpiperidine scaffold. It showed selectivity over the CCR5 receptor, but due to its high structural similarity with serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), this indolylpiperidine was not selective and interacted with several serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors. In order to improve the selectivity, a conformational restriction of the indolylpiperidine via a tropane moiety was performed, and the steric bulk around the basic amine was increased. Moreover, the flexible pentyl chain was exchanged by a methylcyclohexyl linker. The conformational constraint of both the piperidine ring and the pentyl alkyl chain led to 1,000-fold increased CCR2 selectivity over a number of serotonin and dopamine receptors but retained high CCR2 affinity. In contrast to previous compounds, 106 showed moderate CCR5 affinity (IC 50 \u00bc 4,000 nM) (Table 30 ) [41, 119] . ",

SAR studies on both the left and right part of the molecule, containing an aminocyclopentanecarboxamide with an isopropyl moiety, resulted in 107 as most promising dual antagonist. Compound 107 displayed a CCR2 affinity of IC 50 \u00bc 3.0 nM in [ 125 I]-CCL2 assay and IC 50 \u00bc 5.3 nM to the CCR5 receptor in [ 125 I]-CCL4 binding assay. Compared the analog bearing a 3-trifluoromethylphenyl instead of the 3-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-yl moiety (107), the CCR5 affinity increased 4-fold. Regarding to chemotactic activity, 103 showed similar IC 50 values in both CCR2 (IC 50 \u00bc 3.2) and CCR5 (IC 50 \u00bc 4.3 nM) binding assays. A further replacement of the 3-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-yl moiety by the 4-trifluoromethylpyrimidin-2-yl residue provided a less active analog. Screening of the affinity towards various receptors, enzymes, and ion channels (>50) indicated 107 to be a selective and dual CCR2 and CCR5 antagonist. 107 did not inhibit CYP 3A4 and 2D6 enzymes, but inhibited the hERG channel (IC 50 \u00bc 1.7 \u03bcM). Due to the promising in vivo properties with oral bioavailability of 84% in rats and 57% in monkeys and high metabolic stability (t 1/2 \u00bc 93 min), 107 became a candidate for clinical studies [120] .",

Merck developed further a new class of promising CCR2 antagonists based on the \u03b3-aminobutyramide core. The screening of Merck's sample collection led to some lead compounds, which upon further optimization resulted in ligands 108, 109, and 110 (Table 31) with both CCR2 and CCR5 antagonistic properties. A high structural similarity to known CCR5 antagonists was achieved by incorporation of a substituted piperidine ring. Compound 108 with the 4-phenylpiperidine moiety demonstrated moderate binding affinity to the CCR2 receptor (IC 50 \u00bc 150 nM) as well as to the CCR5 receptor (IC 50 \u00bc 72 nM). 108 showed improved potency compared to previously characterized unsubstituted piperidine analogs. Further variations of the phenylpiperidine moiety by 3-phenylazetidine, 3-phenylpyrrolidine, and 4-phenylazepane showed that the piperidine ring was best in terms of CCR2 and CCR5 affinity. The spiro[indenepiperidine] 109 was about 2-fold more active with IC 50 values of 80 nM (the CCR2 receptor binding affinity) and 30 nM (the CCR5 receptor binding affinity), whereas its closely related saturated spiro[indane-piperidine] analog was less potent. The introduction of a methyl group in various positions of the \u03b3-aminobutyramide backbone and the piperidine ring decreased potency with the exception of a methyl moiety in the 3-position of the piperidine ring. However, the CCR2 and CCR5 affinity is strongly dependent on the relative and absolute configuration of the piperidine derivatives.",
