The role of wildlife animals and domestic Artiodactyls in the epidemiology of PPR is unknown or insufficiently understood [38]. Infections of various wildlife species including African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and many antelope species occur apparently subclinical [38, 39] but the only confirmed reports of disease in African wildlife have occurred under captive or semi-free range conditions [40, 41]. According to previous studies, animals that recover from PPRV infections develop life-long immunity [42, 43]. Because of its immunosuppressive effect, PPRV infections are usually accompanied by secondary infections thereby complicating clinical diagnosis.",

During this incubation period, PPRV replicates in the draining lymph nodes of the oropharynx followed by spreading (via blood and lymph) to other tissues and organs including the lungs resulting in a primary viral pneumonia. The acute stage of disease is characterised by high body temperature (39.5 to 41 \u00b0C) which may last for 3\u20135 days [44]. Other signs are depression, anorexia, dry muzzle, excessive salivation, lachrymal discharges and serous nasal discharge, which gradually turn mucopurulent (Fig. 2). The affected animals develop papules in the oral cavity, which become erosive and necrotic. In severe cases, these necrotic lesions occur concurrently with fibrin deposits on the tongue [24, 35, 45]. In the later stages, there is diarrhoea and cough with labored abdominal breathing. Terminally, the animal may become dyspnoeic, progressively lose weight and eventually dies. In mild infections, self-cure occurs after 10\u201315 days of infection. Protective immunity responsible for self-recovery is attributed to infection-induced antibodies against the haemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) proteins [46, 47], although most of the neutralizing antibodies are directed against the H protein [48]. Nucleoprotein (N) is the most abundantly transcribed gene in the host cells. For this reason, the H and N proteins are the two most preferred PPRV targets for the development of vaccine and immunodiagnostics, respectively [49, 50].\n",

            "text": "The development of specific and sensitive molecular and serological techniques have improved the diagnostic precision for PPR since not all cases of PPR can be distinguish from rinderpest, pneumonic pasteurellosis and contagious caprine pleuropneumonia, based on clinical sigs [4]. Based on previous similar outbreaks of the disease in Senegal and Guinea in 1871 and 1927, respectively, it was believed that PPR might have been existing much earlier than previously thought [9, 10]. The disease spread subsequently to the neighbouring African countries like Nigeria and Ghana [51]. Until early 1980s, definite outbreaks of PPR were reported from different parts of West Africa [42, 52] and it was regarded as a disease of West African countries. However, it was later realised that the disease spread beyond West Africa with cases being recorded in Sudan [53]. In the northern part of Africa, PPR was reported in Morocco in 2008 and later Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia have also reported PPR [54\u201356]. Globally, PPR affects about 70 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East [57]. Out of 70 countries that have either reported PPR infection to the OIE or are suspected of being infected, more than 60% are in Africa (except southern Africa). Other infected countries are in Asia (South-East Asia, China, South Asia and Central Asia/West Eurasia including Turkey) and the Middle East [13, 14, 57]. PPRV lineages I and II have been found exclusively in western and central Africa; lineage III is common to eastern Africa and the southern part of the Middle East. Lineage IV is found in Southeast Asia, Middle East and North Africa [23, 44, 58\u201360]. Incursions of PPRV lineages have been also reported, for instance lineage II and IV were found in East Africa and lineage IV in Ethiopia [12, 61\u201364]. Recent outbreaks of PPR in Bulgaria, Georgia and the Marmara region in Turkey increase the threat to Europe [65\u201367]. The spread of PPR beyond its usual boundaries is attributed to cross-border movements of animals and animal products, which are being promoted by trade, nomadic lifestyle, tourism and migration of wild animals [9, 59, 68].",

The genome is a linear, non-segmented negative sense single stranded RNA, which is15,948 nucleotides long. There are six genes i.e. 3\u2032-N, P, M, F, H, L-5\u2032, which constitute the genome. Each of these genes codes for a distinct structural protein and each of these proteins bear the acronym of the respective gene of origin; nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), haemagglutinin protein (H) and large polymerase protein (L). Besides coding for the phosphoprotein, the P gene also codes for two non-structural proteins designated C and V. The C and V proteins are generated through alternative start codons (leaky scanning) and RNA editing, respectively [69]. It has been shown that the N protein is abundant in infected cells and highly immunogenic. On the other hand, given its abundance and antigenic stability, the N protein has been a preferred candidate antigen for development of PPRV immunodiagnostics [70, 71]. The P protein is a co-factor for viral replication and transcription in conjunction with the L protein, which is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The M constitutes the inner coat of the viral envelope and acts as a bridge connecting the surface glycoproteins (F and H) to the ribonucleoprotein core. The H protein mediates attachment of virions to the host receptors whilst F protein induces fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane in order to enter host cells [70]. Then on-structural proteins play several functions including viral RNA synthesis, virulence determination and modulation of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and blockade of interferon signaling.",

The development of necessary tools for PPRV control, including vaccines and diagnostics, greatly relied on detailed insights into the PPRV genome and protein constituents; and on this same basis the virus is now classified into lineages. Structurally, the N protein is divided into four regions I, II, III and IV of amino acids sequences, 1\u2013120, 121\u2013145, 146\u2013398 and 421\u2013525, respectively [49]. Owing to high immunogenicity of regions I and II, these could be targeted for improvement and development of immunoassays. On the other hand, based on H protein mapping of the functional domain, two regions are the most immuno-dominant epitopes (263\u2013368 and 539\u2013609) and are diverse among all the members of Morbilliviruses with significant potential for development of a DIVA vaccine that could differentiate infected from vaccinated animals [47].",

The quality of primary cells is not guaranteed due to the presence of endogenous virus and there is considerable batch to batch variation (Table 3). The infection efficiency of PPRV in primary cultures is up to 100\u20131000 times less than that of the lymphoid cells expressing signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) [78, 79]. Thus, non-lymphoid cells expressing this recombinant protein, are used to isolate and propagate PPRV efficiently [79]. However, transformed marmoset B-lymphoblastoid cells (B95a) derived from Epstein-Barr virus, are more sensitive and support better growth of PPRV lineage IV compared to Vero cells. Virus isolation is expensive and time consuming, thus, it cannot be deployed for routine diagnostic, but it can only be used as gold standard for further disease confirmation and in research studies. Thus, establishment of cell lines with high infection efficiency to PPRV will be of help in confirming viable PPRV in the last phase of global PPRV eradication (Table 3).\n",

            "text": "For PPR diagnosis, a plethora of serological and molecular assays have been developed with continuous on-going improvements. The assays detect PPRV antigens, nucleic acid or PPRV induced antibodies [93]. These assays include agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID), counter-immunoelectrophoresis (CIE), enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA),reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) either gel-based or real time, or reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assays (RT-PRA), immunochromatographic lateral flow devices (IC-LFDs), luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) and pseudotype-based assays. They vary in their technical demands, but all require a laboratory with exception of IC-LFDs, and possibly RT-LAMP and RT-RPA (Table 4). The AGID and CIE assays are less sensitive at the early stages of infection where antigen levels are below detectable threshold and could only detect 42.6% of ante-mortem and necropsy specimens [94]. Thus, progress was made to replace them with assays that are more sensitive and specific, such as ELISA, immunochromatographic assays and nucleic acid-based assays [95\u201398]. ELISA employs an enzyme\u2013substrate reaction for the detection of antigen\u2013antibody interactions. They are suitable for screening large sample sizes and better documentation of evidence-based clinical samples status. Later on, a high sensitive immunocapture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IC-ELISA) was developed based on conventional monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)and it demonstrated diagnostic sensitivity of 100.6 TCID50 [74, 95, 99]. Again, sandwich-ELISA and dot-ELISA based on conventional antibodies were developed and they have been in use since 2002. Dot-ELISA when was compared for its relative diagnostic sensitivity and specificity with routinely used sandwich-ELISA were 82% and 91% respectively, for the diagnosis of PPR [100]. However, dot-ELISA could serve as simple field test to screen clinical samples from suspected PPR cases. In comparison with commercial IC-ELISA kit, sandwich ELISA exhibited 88.9% and 92.8% relative diagnostic sensitivity and diagnostic specificity, respectively [101]. Although the sensitivity of the dot-ELISA is lower, it can also be used in combination with other assays such as LIPS, pseudotype-based assays and nucleic acid-based tests in laboratories where resources are limited. The gel based RT-PCR assays serve to detect viral nucleic acid with high sensitivity and accuracy regardless of being labor intensive, time-consuming and prone to high risk of cross-contamination. Alternatively, real-time RT-PCR assays detect and quantify PPRV present in clinical samples in real time [102]. The high cost of the equipment and technical demands impede its utility in low-income countries. In low-income countries, potent, inexpensive field-deployable diagnostic tools are prospect for use in the prevention and control measures of PPR. Recently developed lateral flow devices based on conventional antibodies have rejuvenated hopes in the least developed countries for rapid detection of PPRV [6, 26]. Despite the pen-side versatility of some lateral flow devices, their sensitivities were not able to detect PPRV in clinical samples with a low virus load as sensitively when compared to IC-ELISA, LIPS and nucleic acid-based diagnostic tools. Detection of serum antibody is also not effective because all assays based on detection of PPRV antibody could not differentiate infected animals from vaccinated animals. Recombinant antigen-based assays are of value during post vaccination evaluation and in the last phase of eradication where free PPRV diagnostic tools are required [96, 103\u2013108]. On the other hand, a battery of potential field-based diagnostic tools have been developed and introduced for use in the diagnosis of PPR (Table 4).\n",

            "text": "A novel pen-side diagnostic tool for diagnosis of PPR was developed at The Pirbright Institute (Pirbright, UK) in 2014. This lateral flow immunochromatographic assay is based on the specificity and affinity of conventional monoclonal antibody (MAb) C77 that was prepared using hybridoma cells technology in a miniPerm bioreactor and purified on a protein G HiTrap column [26]. The C77 MAb recognises the PPRV H protein and has been previously used in a prototype pen-side test for PPRV and rinderpest [6, 26]. In principle, the MAb C77 serves as the antigen fishing reagent on the chromatographic test strip and detection reagent that is labeled with colloidal gold-red. The performance of this diagnostic assay was evaluated in the laboratory and under field conditions on a superficial sample (ocular or nasal swabs). The test showed a sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 95%, respectively, relative to RT-PCR and detected as little as 103 TCID50of cell culture-grown PPRV. The test could detect PPRV in swabs from animals as early as 4 days post-infection at a time when clinical signs were minimal. The IC-LFD kit is a prospect for field diagnosis of PPR and is being manufactured by Foresite Diagnostics Ltd (Sand Hutton, York, UK). The availability of this field-deployable diagnostic tool in developing countries will improve the diagnostic capacity for PPR. This will lead to early detection, which will significantly reduce the negative impact of PPR. Furthermore, this method could be utilised in the field without the need for expensive equipment, removing the requirement for its operation in a well established laboratory. However, case confirmation is essential during an outbreak of PPR. In such situation, field friendly, rapid and accurate nucleic acid-based diagnostic tools (RT-LAMP, RT-RPA and Oxford nanopore MinION sequencers) could be deployed.",

The performance of the test is extraordinary compared to C-ELISA and the IC-LFD for PPR serum IgG antibody detection [27]. The test is rapid, sensitive and suitable for on-site, point-of-care diagnosis and post vaccination evaluation of PPRV.

Moreover, RT-LAMP reagents can be stored at ambient temperature for at least 2 weeks. The RT-LAMP reaction could be performed in an inexpensive water bath, dry bath, or heat block and the reaction results could be directly distinguished through color change or formation of the precipitate by the naked eye or alternatively via agarose gel electrophoresis or real-time turbid meter. Reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification assays have been developed for the diagnosis of PPR based on M and N genes of PPRV with higher sensitivity than RT-PCR [28]. This sensitive, inexpensive and streamlined method can be more readily used in developing countries that do not have access to high technology laboratories. However, in each RT-LAMP assay, primers must be specifically designed to be compatible with the target nucleic acid sequences, which may discourage researchers. In addition, the RT-LAMP assay requires six primers and has unsatisfactory reliability in detection of highly variable viruses. An alternative field deployable recombinase polymerase amplification assay was developed targeting viruses of veterinary importance [32].",

This assay is used for rapid detection of different viruses and parasites of veterinary and public health importance [32, 127].The assay demonstrated a pen-side usefulness for rapid detection of pathogens such as PPRV, Foot-and-mouth disease virus, Orf virus, Bovine viral diarrhoea virus and Leishmania spp [32]. Generally, the assay uses recombinase, single strand binding protein, strand displacing DNA polymerase and a fluorescent probe. Then, the lateral-flow strips are coupled in the detection system. These assays are highly specific for detection of PPRV as there is no cross-reaction with Foot-and-mouth disease virus and Orf virus, which may cause similar clinical signs to PPRV in small ruminants, indicating the potential of being a novel testing tool for differential diagnosis [32]. Although the sensitivity of RPA is lower than for RT-PCR, some advantages of the RT-RPA assay over RT-PCR assay make it rather attractive. Firstly, reaction mixtures are pre-made pellets and provided in vacuum-sealed pouches, which can be kept at room temperatures for several days. This would save on cold chain costs and facilitate on-site diagnosis of PPR in the field. Secondly, the reaction can be performed in a water bath at a temperature of 37 to 45 \u00b0C for a maximum of just 20 min. The RT-RPA assay is rapid compared to RT-LAMP and it does not require expensive equipment and the results are read with the naked eye in less than 25 min. However, virus genetic sequences analysis could not be determined by aforementioned diagnostic tools in field settings to match with the plasticity of RNA viruses including PPRV. The Oxford nanopore MinION sequencers may be of choice in such situation.",

A minute or dramatic change in the environment can have a significant impact on the spread of diseases including PPR. These catastrophes including droughts or wars may lead to humans\u2019 movements from place to place with their belongings, including animals. In such situations, contagious diseases like PPR may spread very rapidly. Therefore to curb PPR spread and control animals\u2019 movements, highly sensitive nucleic acid-based field-deployable diagnostic tools are critical tools in keeping up with continuously changing disease dynamics. In addition, prompt outbreak identification is central to controlling the spread of highly contagious diseases like PPR, but recognizing that an outbreak has occurred can be difficult. Most molecular methods to detect different viral strains require that specimens are sent to distant reference laboratories, with confirmation of an outbreak possibly requiring days to weeks in resource-constrained countries. The development and use of both field deployable immunoassays and molecular diagnostic tools such as IC-LFDs, RT-LAMP, RT-RPA and Oxford nanopore MinION sequencers may play a significant role in controlling disease outbreaks in extremely remote areas in which transportation of clinical samples in optimum cold chain is unreliable (Fig. 3).",

            "text": "In the early 90\u2019s, Hamers-Casterman and her colleagues made a remarkable discovery where they found a structurally different kind of antibodies which are part of the humoral immune response in the serum of camelids [133]. The heavy chain-only antibodies (HCAbs) in camelids or similar molecules in shark (Ig-NAR) are devoid of light chains [134]. The antigen binding domain of Ig-NARs or HCAbs involves a single domain only, referred to as V-NAR when derived from Ig-NARs and VHHs (nanobodies) when derived from HCAbs. The nanobodies have proven to be powerful tools in diagnostics due to their unique characteristics [135]. In particular, the recombinant expression of nanobodies in microbial systems and straightforward purification using His-tag by immobilised metal affinity chromatography makes their purification easy and very cheap. In contrast, traditional MAbs (used in virus detection) need more support costs and they are difficult for massive production compared to nanobody generation strategies [136, 137]. Furthermore, nanobody proteins are robust against thermal denaturation, which obviates a cold chain for transport and storage. Interestingly, despite that nanobodies recognise their cognate antigen via one single domain-only, they still achieve a high affinity and specificity. In addition, the convex paratope of the nanobodies comprising three antigen binding loops or complementary determining regions prefer to interact with a concave surface on the antigen, an architecture that is not antigenic for classical antibodies [134]. Therefore, the use of nanobodies may circumvent binding interference caused by the host\u2019s antibody response. Thus, nanobodies should detect both free antigens as well as those bound by host antibodies, which would make nanobodies based diagnostic tests rather attractive [138]. In contrast, the large size of MAbs prevents them from reaching cryptic epitopes andhost IgG molecules might as well conceal the epitopes from the MAbs employed in the diagnostic test [139]. The use of the nanobody coupled with lateral flow device may accelerate the development of cost effective, highly sensitive, specific and rapid immunoassays. In the light of global PPR eradication, a cost-effective, multiplex (multi-disease) diagnostic test would be very useful for concurrent bio-surveillance of PPR and similar infectious diseases such as contagious caprine pleuropneumonia, bluetongue, contagious ecthyma and foot-and-mouth disease. These multiplex assays may also be indispensable in all phases of PPR eradication operation to rule out mixed infections.",
