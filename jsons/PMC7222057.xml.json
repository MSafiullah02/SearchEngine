Among the 207 patients who acquired any type of infection, 19 had previous ESBL-GNB colonization. In these patients, 6 acquired ESBL-GNB infection (31.6%), whereas 9 over 188 non-colonized patients (4.8%) acquired ESBL-GNB infection (relative risk 6.60 [2.23\u201317.57]). The positive and negative predictive values of ESBL-GNB colonization for ESBL-GNB etiology of AI were 31.6% [14.5\u201350.5%] and 95.2% [93.5\u201397.1%], respectively, whereas sensitivity and specificity were 40.0% [18.4\u201364.0%] and 93.2% [91.5\u201395.1%]. By logistic regression analysis, simultaneous or preexistent ESBL-GNB colonization was the main risk factor for ESBL-GNB AI (OR = 9.61 [2.86\u201332.29], p < 0.001) (Table 4).",

In patients with suspected or confirmed infection, the relative risk for the ESBL-GNB etiology after prior colonization with ESBL-GNB has been diversely assessed depending on local epidemiology. Houard et al. [19] reported a relative risk of 2.6 [1.2\u20135.6] in an ICU with ESBL-GNB prevalence rate of 48%. In contrast, Bruy\u00e8re et al. [15] found a much higher risk (77.5 [23.7\u2013253.4]) in ICUs with a prevalence rate of 7.3%. In our study, the relative risk was not as high (6.6 [2.2\u201317.6]). Differences were due to the lower rate of ESBL-GNB AI in non-colonized patients reported by Bruy\u00e8re (0.6% versus 4.8% in our study), also explaining the higher negative predictive value of prior colonization in this study (99.5% versus 95.2%).",

ESBL-GNB infection in non-colonized patients has been reported previously with various rates. Jalalza\u00ef et al. observed exogenous infection in 2 of 6 ESBL-GNB AIs [14] and Bruy\u00e8re et al. in 3 among 20 ESBL-GNB AIs [15] while Prevel et al. reported no infection in non-colonized patients during a 6-month study [22]. The exogenous source of multidrug-resistant GNB has been examined in the study of Harris et al. [23]. From 1806 previously non-colonized patients, the authors reported 27 patients with ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumonia acquisition among whom there were 14 patients (52%) with an isolate similar by molecular typing to an isolate from another patient with an overlapping length of stay in the hospital. The authors suggest that patient-to-patient transmission is an important and underappreciated cause of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumonia infection and colonization [23]. In contrast, Tschudin et al. reported that only 1.5% of acquired colonization was due to patient-to-patient transmission [24]. An environmental contamination as a reservoir for ESBL-GNB colonization has recently been emphasized for Klebsiella pneumoniae [25].",
