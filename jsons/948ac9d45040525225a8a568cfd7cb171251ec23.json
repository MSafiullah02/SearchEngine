Coronavirus replicons either expressing N or replicating in the presence of N protein supplied in trans showed enhanced activity over replicons transfected without the presence of N. 7 This evidence has led to the general opinion that N protein is involved in the transcription and/or replication complexes of the virus. Taken together, N is clearly a dynamic viral protein.",

Mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV), a group II coronavirus, is being used as a model to study N protein phosphorylation. Data suggest that the N protein of BCV and MHV exists in at least two phosphorylated forms, indicated by differing molecular weights, during the viral life cycle. 8 Data also suggests that only one form is packaged into virions. Thus, phosphorylation of the N protein may play a role in viral assembly. Alternatively, different phosphorylated forms of the protein may perform distinct functions in assembly, replication, and/or transcription. To begin understanding the role that phosphorylation plays in any of the functions provided by N, we have begun identifying which amino acids are phosphorylated in the mature virion and in infected cells. This report focuses on preliminary identification of sites that are phosphorylated in the mature virion. Mass spectrometry is being used to identify which of the many predicted phosphorylation sites within the N protein are actually modified in the virion and in infected cells. Serine 389 and serine 424 have been preliminarily identified on the N protein from purified virions * Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona.",

Purified virion proteins were analyzed in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The band containing the N protein was removed from the gel, destained, and incubated under reducing conditions with DTT prior to in-gel digestion with proteomics grade porcine pancreatic trypsin (Sigma). Resulting peptides were extracted and dried under vacuum. A portion of the peptide mixture was passed through a gallium (III) immobilized metal affinity column (IMAC) (Pierce) to enrich and isolate phosphopeptides.

The first identified peak had a mass of 555.084 Da, corresponding to peptide -NVpSR-encompassing amino acids 422-425.

The peptides were calculated to be approximately 80 Da larger than the predicted peptide masses. The masses of these peaks preliminarily place the phosphorylation sites on the virion N protein at serine 424 and 389. However, when peptides were selected by retention on a gallium (III) IMAC column, only one of the sites, serine 424, was confirmed to be phosphorylated. Because the Voyager DE STR MALDI-TOF (Applied Biosystems) mass spectrometer used to obtain the mass information was not equipped with tandem capabilities, the sequence of the peptides could not be confirmed. Therefore, we preliminarily conclude that the serines at positions 424 and 389 are phosphorylated based on the combination of mass spectrometry data, software predictions, and past data illustrating that the N protein is most likely phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues. 9 Ongoing tandem mass spectrometry experiments will provide more conclusive identification of these sites.",

Given that phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation of both cellular and viral proteins, the role of N protein phosphorylation remains an intriguing, important area of study. There are precedents for phosphorylation involvement in both virus assembly and RNA transcription. Vesicular stomatitis virus uses phosphorylation as a way to control transcriptional activity. 10 The import of hepatitis B viral capsids into the nucleus of infected cells is dependent on phosphorylation of the HBV capsid protein. 11 Thus, identification of phosphorylation sites for both coronavirus intracellular and mature virion N proteins is well justified.",
