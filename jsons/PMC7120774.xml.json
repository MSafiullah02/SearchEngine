Such a high mobility helps biological agents, since they travel with people as hidden hosts.\nUrbanization: due to urbanization, deforestation causes the loss of natural habitat for many animals, that could be reservoirs of biological agents: since cities take place of forests, the probability of contact between humans and these animals increases, augmenting the risk of microorganisms transmission.\nClimate change: many world areas are experiencing a change in temperatures and climates, in particular becoming hotter and more raining. Such events favor the expansion of vectors, like mosquitoes and ticks, in places where they have been eliminated or haven\u2019t been ever present: the consequence is a higher probability of infection in populations which were exposed to such risk only in the past or have never been exposed/affected.\nEncroachment of habitats: high density of population means more contacts, which in turn entail higher risk of transmission.\n",

Similarly, in 1942 the British army started to test the effect of B. anthracis on the Gruinard island: aerosols containing the bacterial spores were spread in the environment, in order to infect several sheep and observe the consequences; the animals acquired infections and died, but the epidemic reached also farms on the mainland [26].

Perhaps the most known case of bioterrorism is the anthrax one in 2001 in USA: letters containing B. anthracis spores were mailed to news media and two senators offices, causing 5 deaths and 17 infections; in 2007, FBI accused the scientist Bruce E.

In an increasingly globalized world, an active monitoring of outbreaks, as well as strategies and resources for an adequate and effective response are required to avoid the spread of such diseases. The 2013\u20132016 West Africa Ebola epidemic represents an example of how the lack of resources and preparedness can affect the response. The outbreak began in December, 2013, in a Guinean rural area, but the country did not have the capacity to detect it; in March, 2014, several organizations, such as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), responded and at the same time new cases were confirmed in the capital Conakry and in the bordering Liberia. During the two following months, the operators managing the epidemic realized that adequate diagnostic tools, protective gears, supportive cures and disease knowledge were missing, increasing healthcare workers and communities exposure; MSF warned about the severity of the problem, but both Guinea government and WHO downplayed it to avoid panic. The consequences became soon evident: the epidemic turned into an out of control scenario, resulting at the end in more then 28,000 infections and more than 11,000 deaths [31]. As positive outcome, WHO quickly reacted to the new Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo in May, 2017: experts, resources and training were provided for emergency management, minimizing the infection spread and increasing the preparedness [32].",
