Both hospitals were chosen for their close proximity to the research group. Permission to distribute the survey was granted by both institutions, including pertinent collective bargaining units. This study was approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board and the local VA subcommittees for clinical investigation and research and development.",

The eligible population included the following: nurses, physicians, respiratory therapists, housekeepers, patient care assistants, and other staff. Units (wards or departments) selected for survey distribution were identified through nursing council meetings and by directly approaching unit managers at both hospitals. Each unit manager requested the number of survey kits to be distributed for their unit. Each survey kit included a script for the survey distributor (eg, the unit manager) explaining to HCWs that their participation in the survey was completely voluntary, anonymous, confidential, and would have no impact, positive or negative, on their employment status; waiver of documentation of informed consent; a collection box; and multiple survey packets. Each survey packet included instructions for completing the survey, which also instructed participants not to take the survey if they had already completed one; a survey questionnaire; an envelope; and a pencil. Survey packets were distributed to HCWs by the unit manager during December 2008. A total of 559 surveys were distributed: 310 at the VA and 249 at the University hospital. Units that received survey kits included respiratory care, emergency care, ambulatory care, skilled nursing, medical/surgical, nursing education, medical intensive care, infectious disease, housekeeping, surgical intensive care, surgery (operating suites), and mental health. Collection boxes for completed .surveys were left on participating units for 3 weeks. No incentives were provided for completing the survey.",

This survey instrument was based on information from published literature on factors that are known to influence adherence to universal precautions, and HCW compliance, with infection control procedures.40, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48 The theoretical model that guided survey development was the Predisposing, Reinforcing and Enabling Causes in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation (PRECEDE) model adapted by DeJoy et al in 1986 to describe self-protective behavior at work.46 One survey question was eliminated during data analysis because of a typographical error on the survey. Two of 5 survey sections that address work environment influences on respirator use and respirator training will receive minimal analysis in this manuscript and will be discussed elsewhere. This manuscript will focus on respirator features that are preferred by HCWs for the next generation of respiratory protection for HCWs. For the purpose of this paper, survey questions were divided into 3 sections: \u201cSection A: Summary Statistics\u201d described respondent characteristics, including gender, education, work setting, staff position, years of experience, time elapsed since last fit testing and N95 respirator use, and style of respirator worn. \u201cSection B: Comfort with N95 Respirators\u201d assessed HCW experiences when wearing N95 respirators. \u201cSection C: Desired Characteristics in a New Respirator\u201d examined HCW preferences for new respirator characteristics. All response categories for sections B and C were on a 5-point Likert scale.",

Nearly 9 out of 10 respondents believed they would rarely or never be able to tolerate consistently wearing a N95 respirator for 8 hours, as might be required during a pandemic; however, the survey question did not ask respondents to estimate their tolerability in the event of a pandemic or exposure to a \u201clife-threatening\u201d infectious agent. These findings corroborate those from a recent clinical field assessment, which produced similar figures for certain respirator models.30 If efforts shift toward building new respirators, it will be important to take into consideration the opinions expressed by the respondents of this survey: future respirators may be better tolerated if they are more comfortable, interfere less with breathing, diminish heat buildup, are disposable, and permit the user to have facial hair. Interestingly, only 44% of respondents reported they wanted a respirator that was socially acceptable, perhaps indicating that HCW safety is more important than the aesthetics of a respirator; or, it may suggest that the survey question needs to be validated. Further research is needed to explore this issue.",

            "text": "There are 3 primary study limitations that merit attention. First, the overall response rate was 28%. This may have been due to the timing of the study because it was conducted during the winter holiday season or it may suggest that HCWs have little interest or no strong opinions about respiratory protection. Although a response rate of 28% may hamper the reliability of the results, response rates of less than 30% are quite common among health care provider surveys.54, 55, 56 Voluntary participation may have biased the results, and, because the survey was anonymous, no data were collected on nonresponders. Furthermore, surveys were distributed to HCWs at the convenience of the unit manager. Future research is needed to address the reasons for nonresponse, and perhaps different research methods, such as focus groups or face-to-face interviews, would be more appropriate to assess HCW opinions about respiratory protection. Second, the study was limited to 2 sites in the same city, and the results may not be generalizable to a wider population. For example, because of the standardization of the national VA system, the results may be more representative of national VA HCWs than those in other settings. Third, the instrument used in this study has not been validated. Although the survey items were constructed using examples from the existing literature,6, 40, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48 the construction of the questions may have altered the results.",

The results suggest that HCWs favor respirators that are more comfortable, interfere less with breathing, diminish heat buildup, are disposable, and permit the user to have facial hair. Building new respirators equipped with features identified in this study may be one way of meeting the needs of HCWs and substantially increasing their acceptance of and compliance with prudent, contemporary respiratory protective measures. Completion of definitive clinical effectiveness trials may also positively influence HCWs compliance and deserves further attention and resources.",
