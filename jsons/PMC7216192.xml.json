COVID-19 has the potential to cause severe acute respiratory tract infection among infected humans and is commonly transmitted from person to person via hands, saliva, nasal droplets, and surface contacts [3,6]. The average incubation period ranges of COVID-19 from 4 to 14 days [7]. The infected person usually presents with upper respiratory tract infection (RTI) and complaints of high-grade fever, a dry cough, and dyspnea [8]. It is highly recommended to keep any suspected individuals in quarantine (isolation) and under observation until further investigation by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can take place [9]. Unfortunately, there is no antiviral vaccine available on the market, but on 16th March 2020 the first clinical trial was initiated by the National Health Institute (NHI), USA [3]. Therefore, patients have to rely on supportive therapy such as vitamins A, C and D; chloroquine phosphate; and general healthcare until the body\u2019s immune system can eradicate the infection [10].",

Although the mortality associated with COVID-19 is low, it has a high spreading potential [12]. Since the COVID-19 outbreak is so fast and devastating, many countries have shut down teaching institutions, social gatherings, sports activities, events, airports, and even banks in an attempt to control the spread of the infection. Besides this, several individuals went into self-quarantine in order to play their part in society by limiting the spread of disease. ",

Mild anxiety is natural and fosters preventive and safeguarding behavior [15]. At the current juncture, people with persistent anxiety may panic and are more likely to make mistakes leading to irrational decisions and behavior. Being on the list of high-risk professions, dentists are very much expected to develop severe anxiety about the current pandemic situation [16]. Considering the current rapid spread of infection, the American Dental Association (ADA) highlighted key steps to be taken by dentists in addition to the standard universal precautions such as taking patients\u2019 recent travel history; assessing signs and symptoms of RTI; recording patients\u2019 body temperature; mouth rinsing with 1% hydrogen peroxide prior to commencement of any procedure; using a rubber dam and high volume suction during procedures; and frequently cleaning and disinfecting public contact areas including door handles, chairs and, washrooms [13]. Although the ADA has published preventive guidelines, the majority of dentists are still reluctant and feel fearful of treating patients in such a situation (Source ADA-COVID-19 Resources for Dentists). In fact, most dentists may not be aware of the recent guidelines. Therefore, we have conducted a questionnaire-based study to evaluate dentist response globally. The present study aimed to assess anxiety and fear of getting infected among dentists working during the current viral outbreak. In addition, dentist knowledge about various practice modifications to combat the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has been evaluated.",

The online survey link was circulated through social media and an e-mail to dental professionals and received a response through an online survey submission. Any paramedical staff and dental students were not included in this survey. The questionnaire was comprised of a total of 22 closed-ended questions, which were divided into two sections. The first section focused on the fear among dentists about getting infected with COVID-19 and the second section was designed to gather information about their practice modifications to combat COVID-19 outbreak in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ADA practice guidelines. A total of 669 participants from 30 different countries across the world participated and submitted the questionnaire, excluding 19 unfilled or partially filled forms (Figure 1). An ethical review board approved the study (AIDM/EC/03/2020/20) and statistical analysis was done on SPSS version 25.

For this purpose, a questionnaire focusing on closed-ended questions was used to gather information about dentist\u2019s fear and any practice modifications to combat the COVID-19 outbreak epidemic. Questionnaire-based studies are proven for gathering information regarding preferences, attitudes, opinions, and experiences of participants; however, careful data collection and interpretation is required [17]. The questionnaire used in the present study collected information objectively and validated through intra-class correlation with a strong relation of 0.74. Any incomplete questionnaires were excluded. Psychological implications such as fear and anxiety are natural in pandemics, especially when the number of infected individual and mortality rates are increasing sharply. Studies on previous outbreaks of similar infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) demonstrated various factors leading to psychological trauma in healthcare workers including the fear of getting infected while treating an infected patient, or infecting a family member [18,19]. The repercussions of the current rapid spread of COVID-19, which has affected millions of people worldwide, ranging from being isolated and quarantined to fatality has resulted in considerable psychological stress and fear. With the prolonged incubation period of the coronavirus (as long as 14 days), it is virtually impossible to pinpoint an individual\u2019s exposure to the virus [20]. In addition, there is no vaccine or approved treatment, which further enhances anxiety upon the thought of getting infected. Healthcare workers dealing with sick patients continuously are at a higher risk of acquiring infectious diseases, adding a tremendous psychological toll [21].",

The current study found that a large number of dentists fear getting infected by their patients or co-workers. The response is similar to the perception of rest of the population where people are terrified of getting infected from other individuals in the community in the presence of a rapidly developing epidemic [23]. The majority of the dentists are fearful of providing treatment to any patient reporting suspicious symptoms. Since COVID-19 has rapidly infected such a large number of individuals in almost every country, the fear of getting infected by a patient is justified. The high level of anxiety was reflected as a large proportion of dentists wanted to close down their practices which may have significant economic implications for dentists and dental healthcare workers. In addition, patients suffering from dental pain and/or undergoing a multi-visit treatment plan may have to experience delays in dental care in such circumstances. The current guidelines on the COVID-19 outbreak have recommended deferring all non-essential dental treatment, and only patients suffering from pain, swelling, bleeding, and trauma are advised to undergo treatment [14,24]. In the current scenario, all elective or non-essential dental treatment for all patients should be deferred until the situation is regressing or under control [14]. There is a study conducted at a dental emergency department in Beijing, China [25], where they have observed an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reporting of dental treatments, which has declined in the emergency department as compared to reporting pre-COVID-19. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, less dental trauma has been reported and the proportion of dental and oral infection has increased while those of dental trauma and non-urgency have decreased [25]. ",

The coronavirus can last on various surfaces for a few hours to a few days [26]. This, combined with its prolonged incubation period before symptoms develop, are factors that make it particularly difficult to limit its transmission. The trepidation of getting quarantined as a result of suspected disease or actual infection is also a legitimate fear when one thinks about how the rest of the family members are likely to suffer due to various aspects. The burden on the healthcare system and cost incurred during treatment also puts one\u2019s mind at stress. Health facilities may not be state-sponsored globally and hence can result in a significant financial burden. The screening and testing for COVID-19 have been greatly subsidized by the government bodies in many countries worldwide, which is encouraging residents to get tested for COVID-19 in cases of suspected infection.

As a part of infection control measures, such information is essential during dental practice. It is crucial in the face of this pandemic to further follow the procedures and guidelines focusing on reducing the amount of aerosol generated and deal with it effectively. Similarly, it was encouraging that a large number of dentists were aware of the current guidelines issued by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and WHO for cross-infection control in the dental practice including asking patients\u2019 travel history and recording patients\u2019 body temperature [8]. Understandably, both these facts may provide a fair idea of potentially infected patients and their precautionary management in dental practice. Of course, the routine universal precautions already recommended and endorsed by various regulatory and infectious control authorities worldwide for the prevention of cross-infection in dental practice should be rigorously adhered to in the current circumstances. Although the majority of dentists agreed that these precautions should be practiced for every patient, unfortunately, a large number of participants reported not using basic cross-infection measures like the rubber dam for every patient. Use of a rubber dam is an effective way to control cross-infection by limiting the spread of aerosols with good patient acceptance for dental procedures [24]. Considering the benefits, there is no excuse for not using rubber dam during dental procedures, especially while using rotary instruments that generate a large quantity of aerosols and droplets. The use of high-volume suction is also considered an essential means to control aerosols evacuation during dental procedures and should be used for the majority of patients [22].",

Hence, this recommendation could be based on the fact that gargling has been reported to decrease the viral load and spread by removing oropharyngeal protease and associated viral replication [29].
