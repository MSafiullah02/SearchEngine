[1] [2] [3] The diet varies depending on the type of habitat, the season, and mainly on food abundance; thus, during the dry season, Sechuran season, increase their consumption to include small animal species. 1, 2 The main ecological role of this species is its contribution to seed dispersal and germination of endangered and economically important vegetable species (eg, \"Algarrobo\" Prosopis pallida, \"Sapote\" Capparis scabrida) in dry forests. 2, 4 However, L sechurae faces persecution by rural people due to conflicts arising from foxes invading farms and chasing and killing small animals and stealing agricultural goods, and by illegal traffic (associated with the fabrication of amulets and handcrafts following superstitious beliefs). 2, 3 Currently, the Sechuan fox is classified as a Near Threatened Species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, although the current population trends are unknown. 3 In addition, the Sechuan fox is classified as Vulnerable by the Red Data Book of the Mammals of Ecuador. 5 Wild canids are considered sentinels of infectious diseases in natural environments 6 ; however, data on most South American canids 0 health is scarce and, there is no data on the health of Sechuran foxes. 1 Moreover, according to the Action Plan for Canids Conservation, health studies on L sechurae are considered a priority. 7 Hematology and serum biochemistry are useful tools for health assessment of captive and free-ranging animals; 8 however, before interpreting such information, reference values need to be determined.

The higher number of variables found to be significantly different between captive and free-ranging females (9 variables) when compared to differences between captive and freeranging males (6 variables) suggests that response to life condition differs between sexes. Thus, female Sechuran foxes seem to be more sensitive to changes in lifestyle than males. Moreover, it should be noted that free-ranging animals were captured throughout an entire year, whereas captive foxes were sampled within 1 month. As hormonal levels vary throughout seasons,43 such cycles may be tampered in the captive group and might have influenced the observed differences in the assessed variables.
