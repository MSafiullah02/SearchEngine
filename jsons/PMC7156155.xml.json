The percentage of COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury has been reported variously at 12%1 and 7.2%2, which is much higher in critically ill patients in these two study. As seen in our report, the abnormal ECG changes were recorded during the critical condition of these two cases. There were several possible mechanisms. Firstly, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a functional receptor for coronaviruses3, which is highly expressed in the heart and lungs. Therefore, ACE2-related signaling pathways might have played a role in cardiac injury. Secondly, hypoxemia caused by COVID-19 may cause damage to myocardial cells. Thirdly, the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders may be important factors4.",

The acute pulmonary embolism should be ruled out, while the reversible SITIIIQIII in a short time made it unlikely. Another potential mechanism that may have induced this reversible complete AV block is the local inflammation of myocardium5.",

The presence of multiple coronary heart disease risk factors and the elevation of myocardial biomarkers made STEMI the first consideration. But the extensive ST elevation in the inferior leads and V1-V4 could not be explained by a single coronary artery occlusion. The most plausible explanation is type 2 MI which was secondary to severe hypoxia and hypotension, under his critical clinical state. However, the characteristic triangular QRS-ST-T-waveform in localized leads (inferior and V1-V4) could not be explained by global hypotension and hypoxia. We therefore speculate that this ECG change might result from acute myocarditis that was induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
