However, when novel coronaviruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) emerge from their animal reservoirs to infect humans (1), they elicit a robust and aberrant immune response that can lead to a very serious and deadly pneumonia (2). Importantly, there are no effective vaccines or therapeutics to treat these CoVs. Efforts to develop long-term therapeutic strategies to combat novel, highly pathogenic CoVs will be aided by an increased understanding of conserved viral mechanisms at the level of their cell and molecular biology.",

            "text": "One of the more fascinating and enigmatic aspects of CoV biology is that CoV virions bud into the lumen of the secretory pathway at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and then must navigate through the Golgi complex and the anterograde endomembrane system to be efficiently released from the host cell (3). The structure and function of the Golgi complex depend upon an acidic pH gradient that decreases from the lumen of the cis-Golgi to the lumen of the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This pH gradient is produced by a balance maintained by proton influx into the lumen of the Golgi complex, proton leak, and counterion conductance (4). Pharmacological and other manipulations of the pH gradient that result in neutralization of the lumen have all been shown to cause slow trafficking of cargo through the Golgi complex as well as alteration in Golgi morphology (4\u20137). A class of small viral membrane proteins with ion channel activity, called viroporins (8), has been shown to have dramatic effects on the secretory pathway, similar to those elicited by pharmacological manipulation of luminal pH. Several well-studied members of this viroporin family of proteins include the influenza A virus (IAV) M2 protein, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7 protein, and the CoV envelope (E) protein. These representative viroporins demonstrate several common functional features despite differences in viral assembly and budding locations. It has been suggested that the role of M2 in the secretory pathway is to neutralize luminal pH to protect the hemagglutinin (HA) fusion protein of influenza from premature activation (9\u201311). Overexpression of M2 causes secretory pathway disruption where the rate of intracellular trafficking is slowed and Golgi morphology is altered (5). HCV p7 is also thought to play a protective role by allowing egress of viral structural proteins through the secretory pathway. HCV lacking active p7 can be partially rescued by both pharmacological neutralization of the luminal spaces by bafilomycin A1 and in trans expression of IAV M2 (12, 13). Similar to M2, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) coronavirus E protein elicits multiple secretory pathway disruption phenotypes when overexpressed in mammalian cells (14).",

            "text": "To understand CoV E at a cell biological level, a recombinant virus system was used to replace the hydrophobic domain (HD) of IBV E with the HD of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G), and the recombinant virus was called IBV EG3 (14, 15). Replacing the HD of IBV E with a heterologous sequence of the same length does not impair Golgi targeting or interaction with IBV M during assembly (16, 17) but would be expected to impair ion channel function. One-step growth curves revealed that IBV EG3 grew to a titer 10-fold lower than that of wild-type (WT) IBV in infected Vero cells. At late times postinfection, the majority of infectious virus resides in the supernatant surrounding WT IBV-infected cells, while the majority of infectious IBV EG3 is intracellular (15). Vero cells infected with IBV EG3 accumulate more IBV spike (S) protein on the plasma membrane than WT IBV-infected cells, and this accumulation of IBV S leads to increases in the size and rate of formation of virus-induced syncytia (15). Highly purified virions from IBV EG3-infected cells lack a full complement of spikes, and most S is cleaved near the virion envelope, likely explaining the reduced infectivity of released particles (14). A buildup of vacuole-like compartments containing virions as well as other aberrant material in IBV EG3-infected cells may explain the damage to S (14, 15).",

This observation suggested that IBV E alters the secretory pathway of the host cell. Expression of IBV E or EG3 reduces rates of trafficking of both membrane and secretory cargo (15). Given that the release of infectious IBV EG3 is reduced, it was surprising that wild-type E protein reduced cargo trafficking. We hypothesized that since the HD was required for these phenotypes, alteration of the Golgi lumen by E ion channel activity was required for maintaining intact virus, and the reduced rates of trafficking were an acceptable compromise for the virus (18).",

            "text": "Studies probing the nature of CoV E ion channel activity have centered on understanding the residues required for this activity and the associated pathogenic and cell biological phenotypes elicited by different CoV E proteins. Two residues in the HD of SARS-CoV E, N15 and V25, have been shown to promote viral fitness during infection (19, 20). Mutation of N15 or V25 abolishes ion channel activity of SARS-CoV E in artificial membranes (19, 20). We previously reported that the E protein of IBV expressed in mammalian cells is found in two pools by velocity gradient analysis: a low-molecular-weight (LMW) pool and a high-molecular-weight (HMW) pool (21). The LMW pool represents IBV E in a monomeric state, while the HMW pool correlates with a homo-oligomer of IBV E. When mutations corresponding to the conserved HD residues of SARS-CoV E that inhibit ion channel activity are made in IBV E (T16A and A26F), the HD mutants segregate primarily into one oligomeric pool or the other. The ET16A mutant is primarily in the HMW pool, while the EA26F mutant is primarily in the LMW pool. The presence of the LMW pool of IBV E, the predominant and likely monomeric form found when EA26F is present, correlates with the secretory pathway disruption associated with the WT IBV E protein (21). This was surprising in that it suggested an E ion-channel-independent role for IBV E associated with manipulation of the secretory pathway. It was recently reported that that these HD mutants abolish ion channel activity of IBV E in artificial membranes, and virus titers are reduced by a log in the supernatant of infected cells, suggesting a defect in virion release (22). Our data on the IBV EG3 corroborate data from that study (15).",

We suggest that increased trafficking and altered cleavage of the IBV S protein observed during IBV EG3 infection may reflect the detrimental effect of normal Golgi pH on IBV S processing. We demonstrate that IBV S processing and trafficking are similarly aberrant when coexpressed with EG3 or ET16A but not WT E or EA26F and that IAV M2 can substitute for WT E to protect S from premature cleavage. Our results describe the first demonstration of a coronavirus-mediated alternation of the luminal microenvironment of the secretory pathway.",

            "text": "The IBV S protein is cleaved by a furin-like protease generating the S1 and S2 subunits during trafficking through the Golgi complex and at a second site (S2\u2032) that primes the protein for fusion with the host cell (24). The S protein of the mutant virus with an HD replacement in the E protein (IBV EG3) is subject to further proteolysis near the junction of the protein with the viral envelope, resulting in a C-terminal fragment that we term the \u201cstub\u201d (Fig. 1A) (14). To compare the processing of the S protein in virions from cells infected with WT IBV and IBV EG3, supernatants from cells infected for 18 h at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 were clarified, and virions were enriched by spinning through a 20% sucrose cushion. The pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were probed with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes S1 (3C7B8) (25) and a polyclonal antibody raised to the C terminus of S that detects S2 fragments, including the stub (26). As shown in Fig. 1B and C, EG3 virions have significantly less S1 than do WT virions, with an increased fraction of a fragment that runs at about 65 kDa. EG3 virions also have reduced S2 and increased S2\u2032 and stub compared to WT virions. We previously reported that nearly all of the S in purified EG3 virions was cleaved to the stub (14). We believe that the additional cleavage in the purified virus occurred during isolation, as multiple steps (including two sucrose gradients) were performed in the absence of protease inhibitors, unlike the enrichment procedure described here. These results suggest that IBV EG3 encounters cellular proteases more readily than WT virus or that the S protein undergoes a conformational change that is more conducive to processing during trafficking of virions.",

            "text": "One possible explanation for the aberrant processing of S in IBV EG3-infected cells is that the microenvironment of the secretory pathway is altered when the E viroporin activity is normal (15, 18, 21) but is unaltered in IBV EG3-infected cells. Given that the effects of IBV E overexpression on the Golgi complex are similar to those in cells where the luminal pH is neutralized (4, 6, 7), we measured the luminal pH of the Golgi complex in IBV-infected Vero cells. We used flow cytometric analysis of a ratiometric pHluorin molecule targeted to the Golgi lumen with a reporter consisting of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) pHluorin molecule fused to the membrane-targeting sequence of the trans-Golgi network-resident protein TGN38 (6). We chose to use the trans-Golgi network pHluorin molecule because the TGN is the most acidic compartment of the Golgi complex, and thus, any alteration in pH would likely be most detectable in this compartment. We generated a clonal Vero cell line that stably expressed pHluorin-TGN38 (Fig. 2A). The generation of this cell line allowed us to ensure that all infected cells were expressing pHluorin-TGN38. The cells were treated with cycloheximide for 60 min to chase newly synthesized TGN38-pHluorin from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To generate a pH calibration curve, uninfected cells were subjected to treatment with buffers ranging from pH 5.5 to 7.5 in the presence of the ionophores monensin and nigericin prior to flow analysis. The emission ratios of the biphasic pH-sensitive pHluorin at these known pH values can then be used to construct a standard curve (Fig. 2B) and predict the Golgi luminal pH in cells infected with IBV in buffer at physiological pH and lacking ionophores (Fig. 2C). Infection resulted in a robust increase in the Golgi luminal pH (Fig. 2D and E).",

Our previous findings suggest that IBV EA26F is found predominantly in the LMW, likely monomeric, form and that IBV ET16A is found predominantly in the HMW, higher-order oligomer (21). In addition, we analyzed the EG3 mutant of IBV E, with a complete HD replacement. Both IBV ET16A and IBV EG3 had trans-Golgi pH measurements similar to those of the IBV M membrane protein control (pH 6.95 and pH 6.87, respectively), while IBV EA26F elicited a pH increase similar to that of the wild-type IBV E protein (pH 7.18) (Fig. 4A). This suggested that the LMW pool of IBV E correlates with the luminal pH increase of the Golgi complex in addition to the secretory pathway disruption demonstrated in our previous work (15, 18, 21). The same experiment was performed with a medial-Golgi-tagged pHluorin, GnT1 (N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I)-pHluorin, to assess if the alteration in pH was specific to the TGN. Here, a standard curve was generated from cells expressing GnT2-pHlorin alone. Expression of either IBV E or IBV EA26F elicited a robust pH increase (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, IBV ET16A increased the pH significantly although not as robustly as IBV E and IBV EA26F. We found that the pH of the trans-Golgi network (measured with pHluorin-TGN38) was higher than that of the medial-Golgi (measured with GnT1-pHluorin). This was unexpected and is addressed in Discussion. We previously reported that the T16A mutant was not completely inactive in Golgi disruption (21), and the better dynamic range of the medial-Golgi pHluorin is likely the reason why we were able to measure a significant increase at the medial-Golgi but not in the TGN. Altogether, the results in transfected cells implicate the monomeric form of IBV E in neutralization of the Golgi lumen during infection and transfection.",

For IAV M2 transfection, we were unable to obtain a high percentage of transfected cells that were subsequently infected with IBV EG3.

We also predicted that processing and trafficking of IBV S in the presence of a protein that can alter pH (i.e., IBV E or IAV M2) would be similar, while one deficient in this (IBV EG3 or ET16A) would produce premature cleavage and more IBV S at the surface of cells. To test these predictions, we first demonstrated that when transiently overexpressed in Vero cells, IAV M2 neutralized the trans-Golgi network in our pHluorin/flow cytometry assay in the absence of the M2 inhibitor amantadine but not in the presence of 5 \u03bcM amantadine, as expected (Fig. 5A and B) (5, 9\u201311). With proof of principle established for M2 pH alteration during transfection, cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding IBV S and IBV E, or IBV EG3, with or without the IAV M2 protein. Surface biotinylation was performed, and the level of IBV S at the cell surface after streptavidin pulldown was determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5C). As predicted, there was a significant increase in the total amount of IBV S at the surface of EG3-expressing cells compared to cells expressing WT IBV E. Notably, the presence of M2 in EG3-expressing cells reduced the amount IBV S at the surface of cells compared to cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 5D). We also measured the total amounts of cleaved IBV S species (S2, S2\u2032, and stub) in transfected cell lysates (without surface biotinylation). We analyzed only S2 fragments, since most of the S in transfected cells is S0, and the S1-specific monoclonal antibody signal was too weak to detect S1 and smaller fragments in this assay. The levels of S2 and stub in EG3-expressing cells were significantly reduced when M2 was coexpressed, with an increase in S0 similar to levels in WT E-expressing cells (Fig. 6A and B). Importantly, aberrant processing of IBV S in cells cotransfected with the empty vector or IBV ET16A could be abrogated by expression of IAV M2 (Fig. 6C and D). On the other hand, the presence of M2 had no effect on IBV S processing in cells expressing WT IBV E or IBV EA26F, and cells expressing these IBV E constructs always had less S2 and undetectable levels of the stub. These results suggest that neutralizing Golgi luminal pH could indeed reduce trafficking of IBV S to the plasma membrane and protect it from premature cleavage.",

Overexpression of IBV E caused a similar increase in the pH of the lumen of the trans-Golgi network and also increased the pH of the medial-Golgi. Our baseline measurement of pH 6.78 in the context of transient overexpression of TGN38-pHluorin and IBV E protein in HeLa cells (Fig. 3D) and the baseline of pH 6.76 in the context of Vero cells stably expressing TGN38-pHluorin (Fig. 2E) are both similar to, although somewhat higher than, pH values reported in the literature for the TGN. Values for the pH reported by pHluorin-TGN38 in different cell types range from pH 6.2 to 6.7 (6, 27, 28). We believe that the higher baseline measurement that we observed is likely due to some plasma membrane cycling of pHluorin-TGN38, which would increase the average pH in a given cell, since the pH of the extracellular buffer was pH 7.3. The cycling of pHluorin-TGN38 is likely to be the predominant reason for a higher-than-expected TGN pH, since the medial-Golgi pHluorin reported a pH of \u223c6.4 (Fig. 4B). We believe that the consistent shift in the Golgi pH in cells expressing IBV E is more important than the actual baseline pH value that we observed with pHlorin-TGN38. Previously, the TGN38-pHluorin construct was used to demonstrate that CHO cells lacking the counterion channel Golgi pH regulator (GPHR) had a 0.4-pH-unit increase (6), which substantiates the magnitude of the observed pH increase in this study.",

The IBV EA26F mutant elicited a pH shift slightly higher than the increase observed with the WT IBV E protein. However, the IBV ET16A or IBV EG3 HD mutant did not cause a statistically significant pH shift in the trans-Golgi lumen. We previously showed that the LMW pool of IBV E correlates with secretory pathway disruption (21), including Golgi disassembly and slow trafficking of model cargo proteins, observed when the wild-type IBV E protein is expressed (15, 18). We hypothesized that the Golgi disruption was likely occurring in an IBV E ion-channel-independent manner (21). This study corroborates our hypothesis and suggests that the monomeric form of IBV E causes Golgi disruption via alteration of Golgi luminal pH through a mechanism involving interaction with a host protein. This interpretation is strengthened by evidence demonstrating that neither the IBV ET16A nor the IBV EA26F mutant has ion channel activity in artificial membranes (22), suggesting that any remaining HMW, oligomeric IBV E that may be present when IBV EA26F is expressed is not likely eliciting secretory pathway disruption or pH neutralization via IBV E ion channel activity. However, To et al. recently reported that mutation of IBV E at T16 but not A26 prevents oligomerization of IBV E, the opposite of our findings (22). The difference in these results is likely due to different modes of protein expression and the downstream assays used to evaluate oligomerization. In our studies, we expressed the HD mutants in mammalian cells and evaluated oligomerization via velocity sucrose gradient analysis followed by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of gradient fractions of interest (21). To et al. bacterially expressed these proteins and then analyzed them via native PAGE after purifying and resolubilizing the samples (22).",

This change in conformation may also release the S1 subunits from the S2 subunits of the CoV S trimer (29). A possible detrimental consequence of the normal acidic Golgi pH for the virus could be that the S protein is subject to a conformational change and premature, and possibly excessive, proteolytic processing, resulting in the release of the S1 subunit prior to receptor binding. This would result in noninfectious or impaired virions. Indeed, the level of S1 in EG3 virions is lower than in WT virions, compared to the level of total S2 (Fig. 1B). Our data also indicate that when IBV S is expressed in cells alone or in the presence of EG3 or IBV ET16A, the levels of IBV S cleavage species are increased significantly compared to those of IBV S in the presence of IBV E, IBV EA26F, or IAV M2, lending support to the hypothesis that the neutralization of Golgi pH by IBV E protects IBV S from premature cleavage (Fig. 6). Additionally, when overexpressed in cells with EG3, S is present to a greater extent at the cell surface than when expressed with WT E (Fig. 5D), corroborating previous data observed during IBV EG3 infection (15).",

Interaction of SARS-CoV E with the PDZ (postsynaptic density protein 95/discs Large/zonula occludens 1) domain-containing scaffolding protein syntenin and with the tight junction protein PALS1 (protein associated with Lin Seven 1) through its PBM (PDZ-binding motif) domain implicates the E protein as a pathogenic determinant (32\u201334). Our study suggests that the transmembrane domain of IBV E might interact with a transmembrane host protein to induce a pH increase in the Golgi lumen (e.g., by altering the activity of the viral ATPase [vATPase], the proton leak channel, or a channel that relieves membrane potential [4]). It is also possible that the relatively long cytoplasmic tail of IBV E interacts with a host protein to modify the secretory pathway. In this case, alterations in the HD could lead to structural changes in the cytoplasmic tail that impact such interactions.",

Intriguingly, the SARS-CoV 3a protein elicits inflammatory signaling similar to that of the SARS-CoV E protein, suggesting that CoVs may encode accessory proteins that (i) may overlap in function to the E protein or (ii) may substitute for a particular role of the multifunctional IBV E protein. Additionally, the SARS-CoV 3a protein has been shown to induce Golgi fragmentation as an antagonist of the Arf1 GTPase involved in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi complex (38). Further study of these SARS-CoV viroporins outside the complicated context of infection, especially their ability to induce pH changes in the lumen of the secretory pathway, will inform our studies on the IBV E protein.",

While other viral viroporins (e.g., IAV M2 and HCV p7) have been shown to alter the luminal microenvironment, IBV E appears to do so by a mechanism that does not involve its ion channel activity. Whether the role of the putative IBV E-interacting protein(s) is pH maintenance, vesicle formation, membrane architecture, protein glycosylation, or any number of jobs performed by constituents of the secretory pathway, interaction of the protein(s) or lipid(s) with the large amount of IBV E known to reside at the ERGIC could disrupt the pH directly or indirectly by interfering with normal secretion or architecture of the Golgi complex. In summary, studies addressing CoV E protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, and the development of tools to evaluate ion channel activity in vivo, will go a long way in elucidating the precise mechanisms of the multifunctional family of viroporin proteins.",
