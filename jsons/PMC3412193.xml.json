            "text": "In 1981, Trams et al.\n8 proposed the term \u2018exosomes\u2019 for exfoliated membrane vesicles, appearing as large (500\u20131000 nm) and small (approximately 40 nm) vesicles, which they identified to be secreted by a variety of cell types. A few years later, Johnstone et al.\n9 discovered that during reticulocyte maturation, specific proteins, including the transferrin receptor, are shed via secretion of <100 nm vesicles that they termed \u2018exosomes\u2019. In the current literature, exosomes are defined as 40\u2013100 nm vesicles that are secreted upon fusion of multivesicular bodies (late endosomes) with the plasma membrane. This fusion event results in the release of the intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies, after which they are termed \u2018exosomes\u2019, into the extracellular space.1 Exosomes are known to be produced by many different cell types, including dendritic cells, B-lymphocytes, various stem cells, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells,3\n,\n10., 11., 12., 13., 14., 15. and can be isolated from cell culture supernatant, as well as from a variety of biological fluids, such as blood, urine, semen (prostasomes), amniotic fluid, and pleural fluid.3\n,\n14\n,\n16., 17., 18., 19. Multivesicular bodies are late endosomes that are populated with intraluminal vesicles by fusion of small cytoplasmic vesicles derived from early endosomes with the outer membranes of multivesicular bodies, followed by invagination of the recruited membrane, inward budding, and scission (Figure 1\n). These events are mediated through the concerted action of the so-called ESCRT complexes (endosomal complexes required for transport).20\n,\n21 As vesicles bud inward, the lumina of these future exosomes capture a small portion of the cytosol, taking along a set of soluble proteins, mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), and other cytosolic molecules. The orientation of the lipid membranes of exosomes is identical to that of cells; that is, integral membrane proteins are oriented such that the amino acid sequences facing the outside of the plasma membrane of cells also face to the outside of exosomes.1 It has been proposed that in addition to random selection of a portion of the cytoplasm, proteins and RNA molecules may be selectively incorporated into exosomes.22\n,\n23\n,\n24\n",

Furthermore, exosomes contain many cell-specific proteins. The incorporation of certain proteins into internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies is not a random selection of proteins expressed in a given cell type. For example, proteomic profiling of proteins in urinary exosomes revealed an abundance of integral membrane proteins targeted to the apical plasma membranes of epithelial cells, but a dearth of proteins associated with the basolateral domain.3 Further evidence for selective protein sorting to exosomes comes from the observations in nonpolarized cells showing that particular proteins are enriched in exosomes compared with the whole cell. Such proteins include the transmembrane proteins CD55, CD59, CD63, CD81, CD82, the transferrin receptor, and phospholipase D2, as well as many soluble proteins such as certain heatshock proteins.14\n,\n22\n,\n23\n,\n29\n,\n30 Ubiquitin- and lipid raft-associated protein sorting have been reported to be involved in this selective incorporation of proteins into exosomes.28\n,\n31\n",

Exosomes may elicit effects on target cells by at least three possible mechanisms (Figure 2\n): (I) They can adhere with high specificity to the target cell surface (without membrane fusion) through adhesion molecules and receptors present on their surfaces, leading to receptor activation and downstream signaling in the target cell.33\n,\n37 (II) Exosomes could hypothetically fuse directly with target cells, resulting in transfer of the contents of exosomes (mRNAs, miRNAs, proteins, and signaling molecules). (III) Another possibility that is better supported in the literature is that the contents of exosomes may incorporate into target cells after endocytosis of exosomes and processing in the endosomal pathway.34\n,\n35\n,\n36\n,\n38\n",

If urinary exosomes can carry out intercellular signaling in the same way as exosomes secreted into blood and extracellular fluid, they could have important roles in renal physiology. For example, exosomes may mediate downstream information transfer in the process of renal tubule hypertrophy seen with nephron loss. In this process, increases in single-nephron glomerular filtration rate are matched by increases in the transport capacity for salt and water in downstream nephron segments, in association with marked enlargement of renal tubule cells and widening of the tubule lumen.39 It is possible that such downstream information transfer is occurring in normal physiological states. Indeed, proteins that are nominally proximal tubule proteins have been detected in the renal-collecting duct, including the water channel aquaporin-1 (ref. 40) and the ammonium-generating enzyme glutaminase.41\n,\n42 Such downstream information transfer may not always be beneficial. We speculate that Tamm\u2013Horsfall protein (uromodulin), an abundant polymeric protein in normal urine, has a role to limit exosomal fusion in downstream nephron segments. Urinary exosomes are typically shrouded by large polymeric fibers formed from Tamm\u2013Horsfall protein, which would prevent them from coming into contact with cell surfaces unless the polymeric network is locally dissolved.43 If these speculations are true, they may provide a basis for understanding how mutations or deficiency of Tamm\u2013Horsfall protein could cause renal disease44\n,\n45 and could therefore warrant further investigation.",

Prime examples are the roles of exosomes and microvesicles in cell\u2013cell communication in immune cell and stem cell signaling. For example, exosome-mediated communication is involved in the priming of CD8+ and CD4+ cells by antigen-loaded major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules on exosomes, showing target cell-specific effects.48\n,\n49 Receptor\u2013ligand interaction between exosomes and cells are also essential to identify specific target cells, as demonstrated by the specific binding of dendritic cell-derived exosomes to activated, and not resting, T cells. The selection of the target cell is mediated by the interaction between inter-cellular adhesion molecule 1 on exosomes and its ligand, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1, on activated T cells,32 suggesting a mechanism by which, on a broader scale, exosomes may be targeted to specific cell types. In addition, it has been demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells contain specific miRNA signatures, which are selectively incorporated and subsequently transferred to target cells.50 Transferred miRNAs affect gene expression in target cells51, demonstrating that besides transfer of proteins, exosomes can modulate the physiology of the target cell by transfer of RNA. Further examples for the role of microvesicle-mediated transfer of RNA include the modulation of stem cells and the stem cell niche, which could be a crucial stem in stem cell-mediated tissue repair (reviewed by Deregibus et al.\n52 and Quesenberry et al.\n53), and potentially represent a system that is efficiently hijacked by tumors for the stimulation of angiogenesis. Blood-borne exosomes may also be involved in angiogenesis, at least in tumors. Specifically, tumors promote their vascularization not only through the secretion of known angiogenic cytokines and growth factors, but also via exosomes.38\n,\n54\n,\n55 On the basis of these observations and others, one could well imagine that blood-borne exosomes could have a role in various glomerulopathies in graft rejection, in hypertension, and in other kidney-related diseases.",

Specifically, the isolation of exosomes allows marked enrichment of biomarkers that may not be readily detectable in whole plasma or even plasma that has been stripped of its most abundant soluble proteins.

            "text": "What disease processes in the kidney would be the best targets for exosome-based biomarker discovery? The answer, we believe, is \u2018those diseases that require clinical decision making, that is, currently non-optimal or too slow with current diagnostic methodologies\u2019. Therefore, there may be renal diseases that are prevalent and have large negative impacts on length or quality of life, but are not good targets for urinary exosome-based biomarker discovery because the addition of a new biomarker would not significantly influence clinical decision making. On the basis of these considerations, one example of a good target for biomarker discovery in urinary exosomes may be the decision-making process encountered in renal allograft patients who experience an increase in serum creatinine levels. The discrimination between rejection and kidney injury, as well as the discrimination between different mechanisms of rejection, is generally addressed through renal biopsy for which a full battery of analyses generally requires many hours or days. Here, a rapid immunological test could speed the initiation of appropriate therapy. Another prime target is early diagnosis of acute kidney injury in surgical and intensive care settings. In studies reported thus far, several potential markers have been identified including KIM1,64 HSP72,65 Klotho,66 IL-6,67 NGAL,68 L-FABP,69 netrin-1,70 or fetuin-A.71 Among these, only the study identifying fetuin-A as a potential acute kidney injury biomarker was conducted using exosomes as starting materials. Exosome analysis may also be useful for classification of other disease processes involving the renal tubule, such as polycystic kidney disease,72 lysosomal storage diseases (for example, Nieman\u2013Pick disease and cystinosis), and transporter mutations (such as Gitelman and Bartter syndromes46). Urinary exosome analysis may also be useful in the detection and classification of liver damage, which can secondarily affect the kidney.73 In addition, it has been proposed that analysis of urinary exosomes could be performed in patients with hypertension,74 possibly to find biomarkers to predict which drugs will be the most effective in lowering the blood pressure in a given patient (personalized medicine). Multiple transcription factors have been found in urinary exosomes and their analysis has been proposed as a means of noninvasively detecting and monitoring various glomerular diseases including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.75 Furthermore, it has been proposed that exosome analysis of urine may provide better ways to monitor responses to the treatment of prostatic cancer.76 The above list of biomarker targets is not exhaustive, and other prime clinical decision-making processes that are amenable to urinary exosome-based biomarker discovery may be readily apparent to the reader.",

This can only be achieved through further basic research based on the following questions: (1) How do multivescular bodies select biomolecules for inclusion in their intraluminal vesicles? (2) How do exosomes interact with cell surfaces of some cells and not others? (3) What is the mechanism of fusion of the limiting membrane of exosomes with plasma membranes?, and (4) How are exosomes in plasma normally cleared and how can this process be selectively delayed for therapeutic exosomes?",

Nephrologists are in a continual search for new tools to improve their ability to rapidly and accurately diagnose renal disease via noninvasive methodologies. The advent of sensitive and accurate MS and genomics techniques has facilitated this quest, and it is likely that in the near future several exosomal biomarkers will come into play in clinical practice. Current efforts to replace ultracentrifugation with more efficient exosome isolation methods, such as filtration,100\n,\n101 size-exclusion chromatography,102 and affinity methods,103 can be expected to lead to more practical protocols for the profiling of exosomal proteins and RNAs. The potential use of exosomes as therapeutic vehicles is based on the fact that exosome secretion and reuptake can move molecules (and information) between cells, processes that can be interrupted or modified by design. Possibly, in the coming years, we can extend this frontier beyond its current main focus in the areas of oncology and immune diseases to achieve new ways to treat kidney diseases and kidney-related diseases.",
