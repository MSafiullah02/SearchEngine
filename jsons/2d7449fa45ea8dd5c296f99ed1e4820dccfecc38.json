The first coronaviruses discovered were the cause of pediatric and adult respiratory infections that were not particularly dangerous. One study from Vanderbilt found coronavirus in about 5% of samples from upper respiratory illness and 8% from lower respiratory illness [1] . Most clinically significant coronavirus infections have been found in children < 2 years of age, as reviewed in this journal in 2009 [2] , although adults also might suffer severe infections [3, 4] . This was the picture as late as 2018: a group of respiratory viruses that could cause serious illness in the very young, but with negligible mortality [5, 6] .",

The latter are considered to be a delicacy to eat by some Chinese, and are sold in many markets in China. The source of SARS is thought to be from a market in Guandong. However, as the receptor for coronavirus is present in human lungs, direct infection from bats may be possible [15] , all the more so because the bat coronavirus that has been isolated is genetically close to SARS [16] . Although SARS no longer circulates in humans, candidate vaccines were developed but never licensed [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

Although mortality seems to be lower than in the case of SARS, many of the infections cause lower respiratory tract disease requiring hospitalization. Although yet to be confirmed at this writing, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 originated from infections transferred from small mammals in the Wuhan market to humans. In any case, it is now spreading by human-to-human contact. Respiratory secretions of infected individuals contain virus, and there is some evidence that virus may be excreted in stool. Obviously, much information is unpublished but is being exchanged through the World Health Organization (WHO) and websites. Sequences of SARS-CoV-2 show 82% homology with SARS and there is some cross-neutralization by SARS antiserum against SARS-CoV-2, but probably not enough to be useful in protecting human populations [14] .",

However, subunit protein vaccines are also being developed.
