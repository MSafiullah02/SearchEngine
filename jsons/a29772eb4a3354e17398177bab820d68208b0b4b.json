Control of its spread is typically attempted through biosecurity measures and extensive vaccination. However, the remarkable genetic and antigenic variability of the virus, which originate from both mutations and recombination events, represents an unsolved challenge for this disease. The present study reports on the emergence and spread of recombinant clusters detected in Italy and Spain between 2012 and 2014. A total of 36 Spanish and Italian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) field strains were investigated and genetically characterized using phylogenetic, molecular, recombination and selection pressure analyses of the complete S1 gene. Based on the partial S1 sequencing, 27 IBV strains originating from Spain and nine from Italy were initially classified as being closely related to the Guandong/Xindadi (XDN) genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 gene revealed that the XDN strains formed a homogeneous clade with the Spanish IBV isolates within the QX genotype, whereas there was higher variability within the Italian strains. Recombination analysis determined that these strains belonged to four groups, which originated from independent recombination events between the QX and 793B IBV genotypes. Our data support the hypothesis of two different scenarios: firstly, in Spain, the large and homogeneous clade probably originated from a single offspring of the recombinant founder, which became dominant and spread throughout the country. Secondly, the nine Italian recombinants, which are characterized by three different recombination patterns, probably represent less fitted strains, because they were less viable with respect to their recombinant parents.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "ARTICLE HISTORY", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Avian infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious viral disease that is considered to be one of the major causes of economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide.

The coronaviruses have a singlestranded, positive-sense, RNA genome of approximately 27 Kb. The 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes four structural proteins (spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N)) and four non-structural accessory proteins. Genetic diversity in coronaviruses, due to adaptive evolution, is created both by recombination events and by mutations, such as substitutions, deletions and insertions, that occur when the viral genome is replicated. The high mutation rates are attributed to the minimal proofreading capabilities of the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, while recombination events are thought to result from a unique template-switching copy-choice mechanism during RNA replication (Simon-Loriere & Holmes, 2011) . Similarly to other coronaviruses, the high mutation and recombination rate of IBV has led to the emergence of several new variants, particularly in Europe and North America where poultry are intensively raised. However, it is believed that only a small proportion of the total IBV genetic variability has been identified. In particular, the S1 protein has been demonstrated to have the highest variability of the whole viral genome (Cavanagh & Naqi, 2003) . This protein, constituting the outermost part of the virion, is involved in host cell attachment and contains virus-neutralizing epitopes. Consequently, mutation and recombination events in the S1 gene are critically important for the emergence of new serotypes of the virus that are able to cause disease in other host species. The continuous emergence of new IBV serotypes has prompted the development of appropriate control programmes aimed to mitigate the low degree of cross-protection observed among IBV serotypes (Dolz et al., 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 791, "end": 821, "text": "(Simon-Loriere & Holmes, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1256, "end": 1279, "text": "(Cavanagh & Naqi, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1802, "end": 1821, "text": "(Dolz et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Molecular studies performed in Italy and Spain showed the concurrent circulation of different IBV genotypes.

The sequences obtained in the present study were aligned with one sequence representative of each cluster using the MAFFT method implemented in GUIDANCE2, and the alignment score was calculated using the same software. To account for the coding nature of the genomic region, the S1 sequences were first aligned at the amino acid level, and then, the nucleotide sequences were superimposed.

To obtain a conservative estimate, a recombination event was accepted only when detected by two or more methods implemented in the programme, with a P-value lower than 0.05. To refine the recombination pattern analysis, a similar analysis was carried out on a smaller database including all recombinants and corresponding parental strains; two Massachusetts (Mass)-like strains were also added as an outgroup. Finally, a collection of recombination-free partitions was obtained for each recombination event by dividing the original alignment at the recombination breakpoints. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed for each partition using RAXML (Silvestro & Michalak, 2012 ) and used to calculate per-site log likelihoods for each alignment partition.

A model of best fit for nucleotide substitutions was estimated for each data set according to the Akaike information criterion. To understand the degree of variation in the S1 gene, the entropy of the aligned amino acid sequences within this gene for the different isolates was calculated using BioEdit (version 7.0.9.0). Entropy is a useful quantification of diversity at a single position of amino acid sequences. Large entropy indicates that the amino acid in the given position is prone to substitution. A higher peak indicates a larger entropy and a higher variation frequency of the amino acid site.

The results of this study showed that genotyping based on partial sequencing of the S1 gene was not representative of genotyping based on the whole gene in some of the variants.

Exchange of a long region of the genome allows viruses to rapidly explore ample areas of the sequence space, potentially leading to the emergence of variants with different features in terms of virulence, cross-protection and cell and host tropism (Simon-Loriere & Holmes, 2011). Recombination, similar to mutation, is likely to have a high fitness cost due to the destruction of optimized intra-and inter-protein interactions (Simon-Loriere & Holmes, 2011).

In the last 4 years, the partial S1 gene was sequenced from samples collected in 1968 (1248 Italian and 720 Spanish samples) and the presence of different IBV genotypes was detected. In Italy the predominant genotypes were QX (37.3%), XDN (1.2%), 793B (44.1%), M41 (5%) and 624I/Q1 (10.8%) (Massi et al., 2015) , whereas in Spain, the main genotypes were QX (12.2%), XDN (19.4%), 793B (64.4%) and IT02 (4%) (Blanco et al., 2015) . Interestingly, the It02 serotype, which was highly distributed throughout Italy until 2007 and Spain until 2011, has recently been replaced by other serotypes, such as QX and 793B. The genotype 624I/Q1 reappeared in Italy in 2010 after 3-4 years in which it was probably circulating below the cut-off level for detection (Franzo et al., 2014; Massi et al., 2015) . Considering the high prevalence of the QX and 793B genotypes in both countries, it is reasonable to speculate that these genotypes coinfect birds more frequently compared to the other genotypes. Moreover, control of IBV in the commercial poultry industry is through the use of live attenuated and inactivated vaccines. Because little or no cross-protection occurs between the different IBV serotypes or variants, different virus antigenic types must be used for vaccine development. Antigenic types, such as Mass-based or 793B-type, have been commonly used in both countries for a long time. Recently (in 2013 in Spain and 2014 in Italy), a new QX vaccine was registered, but is currently not highly distributed. The current vaccines induce a non-sterilizing immunity, which allows prolonged replication, shedding and circulation of the vaccine viruses, particularly when only part of the population is effectively vaccinated. It is likely that vaccination with live attenuated vaccines produces an environment where co-infection between field (i.e. QX genotype) and vaccine (i.e. 793B genotype) strains can enhance the likelihood of recombination. High frequencies of recombination between vaccine and field strains have frequently been reported (Cavanagh et al., 1992; McKinley et al., 2011; Jackwood et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2014) . However, the shorter persistence and shedding of Mass-based vaccines (Bijlenga et al., 2004) and the low percentage of the M41 genotype in both countries (Blanco et al., 2015; Massi et al., 2015) support the absence of recombinants for this genotype.
