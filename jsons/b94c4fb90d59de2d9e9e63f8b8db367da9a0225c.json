He noted 1 week of progressive dyspnea on exertion and increasing cough with purulent sputum. He denied fever, chills, hemoptysis, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and leg edema. He has been using inhaled bronchodilators several times daily and had increased the flow rate of his supplemental oxygen to 4 liters per minute without notable improvement. On the morning of admission, he had dyspnea, even at rest, and called EMS. On presentation, he was afebrile, tachycardic to 110 beats per minute and hypertensive to 178/90 mmHg; he had a respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 85% on 4 liters per minute of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. An ABG drawn while on oxygen revealed: pH 7.24, pCO 2 60 mmHg, PO 2 55 mmHg. On exam, he was awake, in mild distress, using accessory muscles of inspiration and exhalation. The remainder of his exam was notable for tachycardia, diffuse end-expiratory wheezes bilaterally, and an absence of rales. Chest radiograph demonstrated hyperinflation without focal opacity.",

Common symptoms of AECOPD include increased sputum production, cough and dyspnea as a result of increased airway inflammation, mucous plugging and gas trapping [1, 2] . Exacerbations of COPD are associated with a mortality of 10% in the hospital, 43% at 1 year and 50% in the subsequent 5 years [3] [4] [5] . Exacerbations themselves are associated with a step-wise decline in lung function and deteriorating quality of life [6] . The most commonly identified triggers for AECOPD are respiratory viruses, particularly rhinovirus, as well as bacterial pathogens and environmental exposures. many of the risks of invasive ventilation (via an endotracheal tube), including the risk of aspiration, hypotension or trauma during laryngoscopy and placement of the endotracheal tube. In addition, NIPPV preserves airway defenses, which may reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia and usually does not require sedation or physical restraints. The target oxygen saturation in the setting of a COPD exacerbation is 88-92%, which has been associated with lower mortality compared to non-titrated supplemental oxygen [9] .",

Procalcitonin is a promising biomarker, which may help distinguish bacterial and viral infections [35] . Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic use was associated with similar outcomes but less antibiotic exposure in AECOPD [35] .

However, more recently, lower flow circuits of only 0.3-1 L/min have been proposed for the purposes of CO 2 removal, particularly in AECOPD to supplement NIPPV and prevent the need for endotracheal intubation [39, 40] . One retrospective analysis compared 21 patients with AECOPD who did not improve on NIPPV and were subsequently intubated with 21 patients treated with a pumpless extracorporeal lung-assist device (PECLA). No difference was noted in ICU or hospital stay, though those treated with PECLA had reduction in PCO 2 , improvement in pH, and required no sedation, allowing them to eat, exercise and communicate [41] .",
