Hemagglutinin esterase type glycoprotein projections were not seen (Ksiazek et al., 2003). The genome of SARS\u2013CoV is a single-stranded, positive-sense polyadenylated RNA molecule of approximately 29,727 nucleotides. The genomic organization is typical of coronaviruses, having the characteristic gene order [5\u2032-replicase (rep), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N)-3\u2032] and short untranslated regions at both termini. The SARS\u2013CoV rep gene is predicted to encode two polyproteins that undergo co-translational proteolytic processing. There are four open reading frames (ORF) downstream of rep that are predicted to encode the four structural proteins S, E, M and N, which are common to all known coronavirus. Additionally, SARS\u2013CoV also encodes several non-structural proteins (Rota et al., 2003).",

There are many causes of pneumonia and in the absence of a definite history of contact with other patients with SARS, therefore, it is difficult to differentiate SARS from other causes of pneumonia in clinic diagnosis. Laboratory tests that can confirm a diagnosis of SARS\u2013CoV infection early in the course of the illness are, therefore, a critical clinical need (Riley et al., 2003). Since the outbreak of SARS in 2003, several laboratory diagnostic methods have been established, including real-time RT-PCR assay, whole-virus-based immunofluorescence assay (IFA), recombinant protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunochromatographic tests, antigen-capturing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot (WB) assay. These methods were critically important for controlling the transmission of SARS; furthermore, many new laboratory diagnostic methods are being developed (Poon et al., 2003, Poon et al., 2004, Shi et al., 2003, Guan et al., 2004, He et al., 2004).",

In the cases of other known coronaviruses, it is the most abundant among the structural proteins and can induce antibody-dependent complement-mediated virus neutralization (Woods et al., 1987). In addition, the M protein is also involved in the assembly and budding of virions together with the E protein. (Rottier, 1995, de Haan et al., 2000, Molekamp and Spaan, 1997, Narayanan and Makino, 2001, Corse and Machamaer, 2000, Vennema et al., 1996). The M protein contains highly conserved glycosylated sequences, and its glycosylation may be related to the interaction between virus and host (de Haan et al., 2002, de Haan et al., 1998). The important role of the M protein in the life cycle of coronaviruses and inducing immunity make it an attractive target for anti-SARS drug research, vaccine development and the establishment of a serological detection assay. Here, we report the expression of recombinant M protein in P. Pastoris and its antigenicity.",

SARS\u2013CoV is a newly identified human coronavirus that differs from all previously known human coronaviruses (for example, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43) in both the speed of transmission and the severity of disease. Both the lack of understanding and effective methods to control the virus means that the threat of SARS still exists, and therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines and anti-viral drugs. The key role of the M protein in coronavirus assembly, budding and inducing virus neutralization make it an attractive target for the development of vaccines and drugs, as well as for effective diagnostic reagents. SARS\u2013CoV differs from other coronaviruses in nucleotide sequence, and the exact function of its M protein is unknown.

In these assays, however, the viral nucleic acid and antigens needed were commonly prepared from live pathogen, so there is a strong associated risk of individual exposure to this pathogen. Compared with these methods, preparing viral antigens by expression in vitro is both easier and safer. Among the proteins encoded by the SARS coronavirus, the M protein can induce an immunological response and thus may be used for detection of SARS\u2013CoV antibodies. ELISA with the expressed recombinant M protein of canine coronavirus has been reported, and was demonstrated to be a valid and effective detection method (Elia et al., 2003). In order to evaluate whether our expressed recombinant M protein could be applied as a diagnostic antigen for SARS, we used it as an ELISA antigen to detect eight collected SARS-positive and SARS-negative human sera.
