Recovery from viral encephalomyelitis requires immune-mediated virus clearance from the brain and spinal cord, a process that is organ and cell type-dependent [1, 2]. For virus infections of many organs (e.g. lung and gut), cytotoxic processes that eliminate infected cells are an efficient mechanism for virus clearance. The infected cells targeted for elimination by T cells can be replaced quickly with new uninfected cells of the same type. However, recovery from neuronal infection is more challenging for the immune system because preservation of neuronal function requires survival of the infected cells and a noncytolytic clearance process.",

Clearance of infectious virus is the first step and the aspect of clearance most often measured by investigators. However, if infected cells that are no longer producing virus are allowed to survive, intracellular viral RNA must also be eliminated for clearance to be complete. If it is not, a mechanism for prevention of reactivation of virus replication must be established.",

SINV is an enveloped plus-strand RNA virus that is geographically widespread and transmitted by mosquitoes. SINV causes rash and arthritis in humans and encephalomyelitis in mice [3]. After intracerebral or intranasal inoculation of mice, SINV quickly spreads throughout the central nervous system (CNS) with virus replication mostly in neurons of the olfactory tract and hippocampus, and motor neurons of the brainstem and spinal cord [4, 5]. Amounts of infectious virus in brain and spinal cord peak 2\u20133 days after infection. Clearance of infectious virus is initiated 4\u20135 days after infection and is complete by 7\u20138 days (Figure 1\n). Other encephalitic viruses that primarily infect neurons include the flavivirus West Nile virus [6] and rabies virus [7].",

Mature neurons are relatively resistant to both virus-induced and immune-mediated cytolysis. This is beneficial to the host, because if the immune clearance mechanism is damaging to the infected neuron, then the function of that neuron will be lost and the outcome will be the same as if the virus infection had caused neuronal death. If infected cells are allowed to survive, there must be mechanisms for inhibiting intracellular synthesis of virus nucleic acid and protein, for eliminating virus genomes from cells and preventing their replacement after degradation. After SINV infection, neurons survive the clearance of infectious virus and mice recover from infection uneventfully. However, it takes many weeks for the levels of viral RNA in the CNS to decrease (Figure 1).",

Extrafollicular plasmablasts generated in the first phase proliferate extensively and rapidly produce low affinity antiviral antibody that is predominantly IgM [20, 21]. Germinal center B cells undergo class switch recombination, somatic hypermutation and selection resulting in plasmablasts and plasma cells that produce primarily high affinity IgG antibody.

T cells are virus-specific and have effector phenotypes [8]. CD8+ T cells enter the parenchyma, have cytotoxic activity and produce IFN-\u03b3 while CD4+ T cells accumulate around vessels and produce several cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3. The initial antibody-secreting B cells enter the CNS, produce IgM and are followed several days later by cells producing IgG and IgA [22, 24].

During the first hours after antibody treatment of infected cells, synthesis of the nonstructural proteins is prolonged and synthesis of viral RNA is increased before a subsequent decrease in viral RNA synthesis [30].

Therefore, a mechanism for antibody-independent clearance exists for motor neurons, but not for hippocampal or cortical neurons [4, 13]. Depletion of either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells from \u03bcMT mice impairs virus clearance to a similar extent, suggesting overlapping functions, most likely through cytokine secretion.

The initiation of clearance 4\u20135 days after infection suggests an important in vivo role for SINV-specific IgM, rather than IgG. Studies of antibody-mediated protection from fatal encephalitis suggest that IgM MAbs are less protective than IgG MAbs with the same or similar specificity, but IgM from plasma crosses poorly into the brain due to blood\u2013brain barrier size restrictions on protein entry. Therefore, lack of IgM efficacy compared to IgG when passively transferred could be due to the inefficiency of IgM entry into the CNS, rather than a lack of biologic activity. Studies with rabies virus infection have shown that infiltrating antibody-secreting cells are much more effective for virus clearance that serum antibody, so local antibody production by infiltrating IgM-producing extrafollicular B cell plasmablasts may be very efficacious [29].",

            "text": "During this phase of infection there is a rapid contraction in the numbers of CD8+ T cells in the CNS while CD4+ T cell numbers are maintained and B cell numbers increase (Figure 2). Mice deficient in IFN-\u03b3 or in the response to IFN-\u03b3 often display transient reactivation of virus production 12\u201322 days after infection [13] (Figure 3\n), suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 is needed to continue to decrease levels of viral RNA. It is possible that CD8+ T cells provide early local IFN-\u03b3 production and that CD4+ T cells are essential for continued local production of IFN-\u03b3 and potentially for providing local help to maintain both CD8+ T cell function [40, 41] and antibody production by B cells [42]. Antibody produced in the CNS during this phase of clearance is high avidity IgG and IgA which may also regulate intracellular production of viral RNA.",
