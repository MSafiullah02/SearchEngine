Two main proteins of the lipidic envelope, the fusion protein (F) and the G protein, are antigenically significant, thus inducing neutralizing antibody response. The F protein is highly conserved, while the carboxy-terminal portion of hypervariable region of G protein is subject to rapid mutations. Considering the different in vitro reaction to monoclonal antibodies due to the virion external G protein, RSV has been classified into two subtypes, A and B [6, 7]. These two major serotypes can simultaneously circulate during epidemic season, but, usually, one prevails over the other. Recently, RSV genome sequencing has enabled the identification of multiple genotypes and to date, the analysis of nucleotide sequences of G protein led to describe 11 RSV-A and 23 RSV-B genotypes [8].",

Monitoring genotypic characterization of the RSV virus could help in understanding the pathogenesis of the infection, in predicting the clinical severity of the disease, and in selecting candidate strains for development of therapeutic and vaccine strategies. It is recognized by many studies that the RSV infection has a more severe course in premature and immunocompromised children [11\u201313]. It is clear that both the characteristics of the host (age, prematurity, comorbidity, immunodeficiency) and of the virus (including the subtype) influence the clinical course of infection, however the actual contribution of each factor is still unclear. To date, the clinical impact of viral factors related to RSV is still controversial. While many studies report no differences between the two serotypes [8, 9, 14\u201316], many others relate the worst prognosis to RSV-A [10, 17\u201320] and some others to RSV-B [21\u201323]. In 2014 Cangiano et al. [24] highlighted the major role played by RSV in severe bronchiolitis and different rates of RSV related hospitalization in different epidemic season. A review conducted by Kuhdari et al. [4] confirmed the high impact of RSV infection on hospitalization in Italy, especially in children aged less than one year. Recently Midulla et al. [10] described the important influence of specific RSV genotypes on the clinical course of bronchiolitis in a previously healthy and term population. The authors reported deep differences in the demographic characteristics and in the clinical presentation, but not in the necessity and the duration of oxygen (O2) therapy.",

Prophylaxis with palivizumab (a monoclonal antibody anti-F protein) reduces RSV LRTI in late-moderate preterm population; however, infants are eligible for prophylaxis only according to specific national guidelines. According to the recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics, in 2016 the Italian Drug Agency (AIFA) limited the prescription of palivizumab to the group of < 29 wGA and age < 12 months at the beginning of the RSV season [26, 27]. Since then, several evidences in Italy reported an increase in vulnerability of all preterm infants [28\u201331]. Therefore, in 2017 the AIFA authorized again the use of palivizumab for preterm infants of \u226435wGA aged less than six months at the start of epidemic season [32].",

We excluded patients with incomplete medical record. We included in the study preterm infants as born < 37 wGA. Data processing was performed with the Microsoft Excel 2018 software. We obtained demographic characteristics of patients (including gestational age, sex and age), length of stay (LOS), medical history during recovery and necessity of O2 therapy administered in pediatric ward as low flow or high flow nasal cannulas. Finally, we evaluated admissions and LOS in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) due to non-invasive Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (C-PAP) or invasive mechanic ventilation.

For each reaction, 7 \u03bcl of DNA/RNA in a final volume of 25 \u03bcl were used. Real time PCR was performed on CFX96 (Bio Rad Laboratories, Italy) with respiratory panel assay kit. The panel is made up of 3 mixes which allow the identification of 16 different viruses (Influenza A and B virus, Respiratory syncytial virus A and B, Adenovirus, Enterovirus, Parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3 and 4, Metapneumovirus, Bocavirus, Rhinovirus, 3 Coronaviruses (NL63, 229E and OC43) and 3 Influenza A subtypes. An internal control was included in each sample to check both extraction efficiency and PCR inhibition. In every run, a negative control was used to monitor carry-over contamination.

            "text": "In full term infants, the prevalent serotype among the season was also responsible for most cases requiring oxygen supplementation and intensive care. In preterm infants instead, over the three investigated seasons, the rates of infection by RSV-A were higher compared with those caused by RSV-B, independently from the prevalent circulating serotype. Remarkably, the incidence of desaturation and the use of O2 therapy during RSV-A bronchiolitis was always prevalent compared to RSV-B bronchiolitis. According to this result, in premature infants RSV-A was related to an higher risk of O2 therapy compared to RSV-B (OR 2.39).",

            "text": "Our work, in line with current literature [17\u201319], describes seasonal alternation of RSV serotypes A and B. This would explain RSV-A prevalence in our sample, since we have analyzed three sequential seasons. In our case series, there is no evidence of a serotype being more aggressive than the other, but we observed a relative increase of severe bronchiolitis for RSV-A, especially for premature children, as already considered by Esposito et al. [9]. Recently, an Italian study [10] described a worse clinical outcome in RSV-A related bronchiolitis, arguing that low weight and younger age at admission were more often associated with novel RSV-A genotype infection. In comparison with their results, we did not find differences in percentages of O2 therapy between RSV A and B, as the prevalent serotype showed a major virulence in general population. However, we found an increased relative risk of O2 therapy in RSV-A infected premature patients. Many studies have investigated the clinical relevance of environmental factors in severe clinical course of RSV infection [12, 34, 35]. In our study, however, the higher incidence of serotype A in preterm population, together with the resultant severe clinical course, suggests a higher virulence of RSV-A per se. This could suggest an important involvement of the immune response to the virus and a role for different immune mechanisms in response to the virus in preterm infants. Indeed, there are many evidences about lack of immunity in preterm children, regarding count and activity of all subsets of T cells [36] and deficient antibody production in younger infants infected with RSV [37]. Since various components of the innate and adaptive immune response are crucial for controlling RSV infection and disease [38], more studies are needed to focus preterm specific immune response. Moreover, some evidences in vitro reported different pathways of inflammatory activation by RSV-A and B [39].",
