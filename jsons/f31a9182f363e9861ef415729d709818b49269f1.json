We assume that the reproduction is asexual, and that the mutations can be described by a linear integral operator. We are interested in the interplay between the time variable t and the rate \u03b5 of mutations. We show that depending on \u03b1 > 0, the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0 with t = \u03b5 \u2212\u03b1 can lead to population number densities which are either Gaussian-like (when \u03b1 is small) or Cauchy-like (when \u03b1 is large).",

In particular, the importance of the variance of the population along a phenotypic trait is illustrated by the fundamental theorem of natural selection [16] , and the breeder's equation [23] : the evolution speed of a population along a one dimensional fitness gradient (or under artificial selection) is proportional to the variance of the initial population. Recently, the phenotypic variance of populations has also come to light as an important element to describe the evolutionary dynamics of ecosystems (where many interacting species are considered) [30, 4, 29] .",

Evolutionary Rescue is concerned with a population living in an environment that changes suddenly. The population will survive either if some individuals in the population carry an unusual trait that turns out to be successful in the new environment, or if new mutants able to survive in the new environment appear before the population goes extinct (see [26] for a discussion on the relative effect of de novo mutations and standing variance in Evolutionary Rescue). In any case, the fate of the population will not be decided by the properties of the bulk of its density, but rather by the properties of the tail of the initial distribution of the populations, close to the favourable traits for the new environment. A first example of such problem comes from emerging disease [17] : Animal infections sometimes are able to infect humans. This phenomena, called zoonose, is the source of many human epidemics: HIV, SARS, Ebola, MERS-CoV, etc. A zoonose may happen if a pathogen that reaches a human has the unusual property of being adapted to this new human host. A second example comes from the emergence of microbes resistant to an antimicrobial drug that is suddenly spread in the environment of the microbe. This second phenomenon can easily be tested experimentally [3, 27] , and has major public health implications [9] .",

            "text": "Most papers devoted to the genetic diversity of populations structured by a continuous phenotypic trait describe the properties of mutation-selection equilibria. It is however also interesting to describe the genetic diversity of population that are not at equilibrium (transient dynamics): pathogen populations for instance are often in transient situations, either invading a new host, or being eliminated by the immune system. We refer to [19] for a review on transient dynamics in ecology. For asexual populations structured by a continuous phenotypic trait, several models exist, corresponding to different biological assumptions [13] . If the mutations are modeled by a diffusion, the steady populations (for a model close to (1) , but where mutations are modelled by a Laplacian) are Gaussian distributions [21, 7] . Furthermore, [1, 12] have considered some transient dynamics for this model. In the model that we will consider (see (1) ), the mutations are modelled by a non-local term. It was shown in [6] (see also [7] ) that mutation-selection equilibria are then Cauchy profiles (under some assumptions), and this result has been extended to more general mutation kernels in [8] , provided that the mutation rate is small enough. Finally, let us notice that the case of sexual population is rather different, since recombinations by themselves can imply that a mutation-recombination equilibrium exists, even without selection. We refer to the infinitesimal model [5] , and to [28] for some studies on the phenotypic distribution of sexual species in a context close to the one presented here for asexual populations.",

Another way to look at these results is to consider t \u2265 0 and \u03b5 > 0 as two parameters, and to see the approximations presented above as approximations of f \u03b5 (t, \u00b7) for some set of parameters: f \u03b5 (t, \u00b7) \u223c \u03b5\u21920 \u0393 2 (\u03b5, \u00b7) for (t, \u03b5) \u2208 {(t,\u03b5);t \u03b5 \u22124 }, while f \u03b5 (t, \u00b7) \u223c \u03b5\u21920 \u0393 1 (t, \u03b5, \u00b7) for (t, \u03b5) \u2208 {(t,\u03b5); 1 t \u03b5 \u22122/3 }. We have represented these sets in Fig 3. As described in the Subsection 1.1, the phenotypic distribution of species is involved in many ecological and epidemiological problematics. Our study is a general analysis of this problem and we do not have a particular application in mind. An interesting and (to our knowledge) new feature described by our study is that the tails of the traits distribution in a population can change drastically between \"short times\", that is 1 t \u03b5 \u22122/3 and \"large times\", that is t \u03b5 \u22124 : the distribution is initially close to a Gaussian distribution, with small tails, and then converges to a thick tailed Cauchy distribution. This result could have significant consequences in for evolutionary rescue: the tails of the distribution then play an important role. Quantifying the effect of this property of the tails of the distributions would however require further work, in particular on the impact of stochasticity (the number of pathogen is typically large, but finite). The plasticity of the pathogen (see [11] ) may also play an important role.",
