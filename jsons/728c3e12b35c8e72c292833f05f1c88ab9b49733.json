We also bring forth evidence from the emotion regulation literature to help mitigate the downstream negative consequences of COVID-19 on people's work lives.

In other words, the toll on individuals is not just physical and financial, but emotional as well. Many studies have consistently found relationships between the occurrence of infectious disease outbreaks and a host of psychological and behavioral consequences. Among the negative psychological consequences that have been most frequently reported are greater incidence of depression and psychological distress (Bai et al., 2004 Bults et al., 2011 Jones & Salathe, 2009; Schultz et al., 2016) , worry (Thompson et al., 2017) , functional impairment (Thompson et al., 2017) , anxiety about being infected (Horney et al., 2010; Jehn et al., 2011; Rubin, Potts, & Michie, 2010; Legatt et al., 2010) , and reduced quality of life (van Hoek, Underwood, Jit, Miller & Edmunds, 2011) and subjective well-being (Lau et al., 2008) . In terms of behavioral consequences, exposure to outbreaks also resulted in preventive behaviors such as improved hygienic practices (Bults et al., 2011; Kiviniemi et al., 2011) , seeking medical assistance (Lau et al., 2009 (Lau et al., , 2011 and engaging in social distancing and isolation (Setbon et al., 2011; Wong J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 mitigation strategies (e.g., social distancing, home containment, and travel restrictions) aimed to prevent the spread of the disease. For example, in a study of health care workers in a treatment facility during the SARS outbreak, Maunder and colleagues (2003) reported incidents of professional isolation arising from the use of protective masks and observance of non-physical contact with co-workers reduced morale among health care workers, and refusal to work among administrative and professional staff. Bai and colleagues (2004) investigated reactions of health care workers and professional staff shortly after 57 health care workers were quarantined due to the SARS epidemic. Results revealed that 20% of the participants reported feeling stigmatized, ostracized and rejected in their neighborhoods due to their hospital work while 9% expressed reluctance to return to work or had thoughts of quitting their job.",

The labor market conditions resulting from COVID-19 may also substantially alter career trajectories and impede job search strategies among individuals entering the workforce. Those in school-to-work transition contexts as well as younger workers face scarce employment and apprenticeship prospects that not only disrupt formal entry to the labor market but also delay the acquisition of career competencies (Berkman, 2008; Blake et al., 2010; ILO 2020) . In addition, findings from national surveys involving US workers before and after previous economic downturns show that those who remain employed may experience significant pay cuts, reduction in work hours, and prolonged furloughs while also facing increased work demand and challenging working conditions (Frone, 2018) .",

Having described the three broad and inter-related circumstances which many working individuals are likely to experience during the pandemic, we now discuss some ideas about the role of emotion regulation in alleviating negative impacts. Psychologists refer to emotion regulation as the process of initiating, maintaining, and modifying one's emotional experience and expression (C\u00f4t\u00e9, DeCelles, McCarthy, Van Kleef, & Hideg, 2011; Gross, 2014) . Compelling evidence Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 reveals that effective emotion regulation is not only associated with myriad health and sociopsychological benefits but can also help employees manage many work and career-related challenges (Joseph & Newman, O'Boyle Jr et al., 2011; van der Linden et al., 2017) . It is important to recognize and appreciate the power of emotion regulation in the face of the current destructive and disruptive COVID-19.",

Therefore, employees who can successfully regulate their emotions may be more effective and efficient in completing their work goals despite having to suddenly transition their work to a home environment where many other distractions and demands may exist (Muraven & Baumeister, 2000) . Second, emotion regulation has many social benefits as it facilitates positive social interactions and enhances relationship quality (Gross, 2014) . For instance, emotion regulation cultivates empathy, compassion, and helping behavior toward others (Eisenberg, 2000; Lebowitz & Dovidio, 2015) .

While the impact of pandemics/global health crises (e.g., SARS outbreak; Avian H5N1 strain; Ebola virus) on individuals' emotional and mental health has been frequently articulated in the literature (e.g., Bults et al., 2011; Maunder et al., 2003; Schultz et al., 2016) , most of the research tends to be descriptive (e.g., documenting its deleterious effects on mental health) and prescriptive (e.g., offering ways to cope without testing their effectiveness) in nature. We are not suggesting that the prior work has less value or is insignificant. In fact, these studies serve as a foundation for setting the stage for a timely and pragmatic research agenda that utilizes more rigorous methods and analysis; one that enables us to study more closely and scientifically how working individuals can respond to a pandemic of this magnitude from an emotion regulation perspective. For example, do employees experience different types of emotions in response to this pandemic (e.g., sadness, anger, hopelessness, guilt, or even shame) and if so, why? How do the different types of negative emotions influence people's careers differently?",
