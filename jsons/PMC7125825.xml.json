In the post-attachment assay, MERS-PV was mixed with host cells, and the compounds were added 2 h later. While the relative infectivity of MERS-PV treated with hit compounds was approximately 80% in the post-attachment assay, the relative infectivity in the pre-attachment and during attachment assays was significantly less (\u226450%; Supplementary Fig. 1), which indicates that the hit compounds may block virus entry.

Although E-64-C did not show a consistent reduction in infection in the pre-attachment assay, dihydrotanshinone and E-64-D showed antiviral activities in the pre-attachment assay (dihydrotanshinone, 6.5 to 5.5 Log TCID50/mL at 2 \u00b5g/mL; E-64-D, 6.5 to 5.1 Log TCID50/mL at 0.5 \u00b5g/mL; Supplementary Fig. 2a). E-64-D irreversibly and selectively inhibits cysteine proteases, such as papain, calpain, and cathepsin, by modifying the thiol group to the thioester form [4]. The critical factors for MERS-CoV entry include host cell proteases, such as the pH-dependent endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L [3]. We showed that E-64-D reduced the titer in the pre-attachment assay, which could be explained by inhibition of viral entry; hence, the antiviral effect might be associated with cathepsin inhibition.",

Dihydrotanshinone is a major lipophilic compound extracted from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (known as Dansam in Korean) that is commonly used in traditional Asian medicine. Tanshinones derived from S. miltiorrhiza showed specific inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro and PLpro proteases, which are coronavirus cysteine proteases involved in initiation of viral replication [5]. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of dihydrotanshinone in the post-attachment assay could be associated with inhibition of coronavirus replication. This study demonstrated that dihydrotanshinone had inhibitory effects against viral entry in the MERS-CoV and MERS-PV assays. Therefore, dihydrotanshinone may have dual inhibitory effects, blocking virus entry and replication in association with viral proteases. However, further studies, including mechanistic analyses of dihydrotanshinone, are needed.",
