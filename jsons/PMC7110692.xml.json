In 2017, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that 10 million people developed active TB causing up to 1.6 million deaths [1]. The WHO's End-TB strategy aims to reduce the overall number of TB deaths by 95% and the TB incidence rate by 90% in 2035 compared with the 2015 baseline incidence and mortality figures [2]. Key to achieving these targets is the early diagnosis and appropriate management of TB cases worldwide according to national and international guidelines [[3], [4], [5], [6]]. This includes in the context of mass gatherings such as the annual Hajj in Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), where over 2 million pilgrims, many originating from TB endemic areas, congregate in crowded settings and worship under conditions that increase the risk of TB transmission [7,8].",

However, while TB cases have been reported during the event [10,11], TB management approaches during this unique event remained largely undocumented, and it is unknown whether these are consistent with the KSA and international TB management guidelines. Hospitals in Makkah serve both Hajj pilgrims as well as local residents and the Hajj workforce during the mass gathering free of charge. The additional stress on these health facilities during Hajj may compromise the services provided for all patients during the event, including those diagnosed with TB. This study documents the management of drug-sensitive TB patients during Hajj and explores the compliance of healthcare providers with the KSA TB management guidelines in the Ministry of Health (MOH) hospitals in Makkah during the mass gathering.",

The themes were 1) identifying TB suspect, 2) IPC and surveillance, 3) diagnosing TB and 4) treating drug-sensitive TB. For each theme, relevant indicators were identified from the questionnaire (Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5). A score of 1 was assigned for each indicator/variable that was consistent with the 2014 KSA TB management guideline [6] (latest version during study period) and 0 for inconsistency with the guideline.

Although Saudi Arabia is not a high TB burden country, TB incidence in the country show significant regional variation with the Makkah region showing much higher TB incidence rates than the rest of the country and rising trend [18,19]. In addition to the hosting of the Hajj and Umrah mass gatherings, this high TB incidence may also be related to the fact that around 40% of the Makkah region population are non-Saudis, many originate from and frequently visit high TB burden countries [18,19].

To the best of our knowledge, there is no standardized global protocol guiding the choice of suitable models of care-whether home based or hospitalized care-during international mass gatherings.

In the current study, we report high compliance with the aspects of TB IPC measures investigated. Effective separation of patients presenting with symptoms and signs consistent with TB as well as isolation of confirmed TB cases was reported. The high compliance scores for IPC may be partly related to the rigorous measures taken by the KSA MOH to prevent and control Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in the Kingdom which, as TB, also does spread through infected person's respiratory secretions such as via coughing and sneezing [26].",

The WHO recommends that persons with signs and symptoms consistent with TB should be evaluated for TB to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment [3,5]. Similarly, the Saudi TB guideline recommends that healthcare workers (HCWs) should be knowledgeable about TB symptoms to facilitate the efficient identification of TB suspects for diagnosis and treatment [6]. In the current study, providers utilized presenting symptoms to correctly identify suspected TB patients in all cases. Cough and fever with chills/night sweat were the most frequent symptoms among patients. This finding corroborates existing evidence that identifies cough as the most common symptom of PTB [3,27]. Further, in majority of cases (67.7%, 21/31), chest X-ray, a recommended screening tool for active TB, was conducted for the TB suspects. Chest X-ray is particularly more sensitive for TB screening after a positive symptom screening [27]. However, we also found that less than half of the TB suspected cases were questioned about TB risk factors. Adequate knowledge of TB symptoms and risk factors among providers are prerequisites for correct and prompt identification of suspected TB patients for screening and diagnosis [5,6]. In view of the significant use of both symptom-based and radiological screening methods in this study, a total guideline compliance score of 7.2 out of 10 was obtained for the prompt identification and screening of TB suspects theme for TB management.",

In the current study, half of the TB cases had more than 2 visits to healthcare facilities before TB screening/diagnosis tests were ordered for the patients. While studies from other settings reported similar findings [30,31], our results are concerning, as delays in diagnosing TB during Hajj may lead to significant transmission given the crowded setting during the event. Similarly, sputum culture (which takes at least 2\u20133 weeks to produce results) was the only recommended diagnostic test applied in about 70% (21/31) of cases. The application of sputum culture as the singular diagnostic test is not consistent with approved standards for TB diagnosis [6]. As 75% (18/24) of suspected cases were confirmed to have TB by the third day of arrival in the health facility, it appears that providers relied on screening tests, such as chest X-ray, for the confirmation of TB diagnosis. This practice is inconsistent with both national and international guidelines; chest radiography is only recommended for screening purposes.",

Nonetheless, Xpert MTB/RIF, which could detect TB and MDR-TB by proxy in the same day [32], was not applied for TB diagnosis in this study. Although available in a number of Saudi hospitals and reference labs, the roll out of Xpert MTB/RIF has been slow and its use for point-of-care testing is limited [7,33]. Access to same day diagnosis of TB could prove valuable in a highly mobile Hajj population where follow-up visits to the same health facility may not be guaranteed and where delays in diagnosis may increase the risk of transmission in such crowded settings. As such, KSA authorities should consider the provision of TB molecular testing capability in health facilities within the Hajj areas to facilitate rapid (same-day) diagnosis of TB during the mass gatherings.",

As a low prevalence setting, knowledge of HIV among healthcare workers is low in Saudi Arabia [34]. Yet, HIV could be a more frequent comorbidity among pilgrims who arrive with active TB from areas with high HIV disease prevalence [1]. More so, a missed or delayed HIV diagnosis in a TB patient stalls the commencement of appropriate treatment and results in poor outcomes for the patient, community and health system [35]. Therefore, healthcare providers in KSA ought to be trained and guided to conduct screening for HIV and other comorbidities in all suspected TB patients irrespective of their nationality. In general, because of delays in diagnosis, infrequency of HIV testing and failure to utilize the appropriate diagnostic tests for suspect TB patients, the combined score for the TB diagnosis theme was 3 out of a maximum of 10, the lowest score of all TB management themes in the current study.",
