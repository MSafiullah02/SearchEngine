They would then be in a position to make informed decisions on matters related to science and technology that affect them. For example, high cholesterol foods are increasingly being partaken by people in today\u2019s urban societies \u2013 are they aware that cholesterol can be deposited on the walls of blood vessels and later give rise to heart problems? Furthermore, with the pervasive influence of globalisation, borders between countries have become more porous, and developments in one country can affect another. Air travel has shrunk distances between countries, and infectious diseases can spread quite rapidly from its source, which could be in another distant part of the world; also, forest fires in one country can affect air quality in neighbouring countries. As such, people do need to know what steps can be taken in order to mitigate such risks. More such examples can be given, but the point to note is that people need to have some basic science literacy in order to manage risks as well as to be able to make prudent decisions on matters related to science and technology that affect them. This is where public education about science can play a useful role.",

Many countries in the West have used this approach to provide their people with a good standard of living. Such an approach for development is possible when people are receptive to the potential of science and technology to promote economic development and their well-being. Again, public education about science is essential. A scientifically literate citizenry can help governments to realise socio-economic objectives (Tan & Subramaniam, 1998).",

There are also a number of institutions that promote informal science learning to people, and these efforts give rise to useful tributaries for the cause of public education on science. In this context, the roles of the Science Centre Singapore (Caleon & Subramaniam, 2005, 2007; Dairianathan & Subramaniam, 2011; Tan & Subramaniam, 1998, 2003) and the Singapore National Academy of Science as well as its constituent societies (Tan & Subramaniam, 1999, 2009) are well documented. Destinations such as the zoo, bird park and botanic gardens have also played a useful role in public education about science. However, some aspects of public education about science in Singapore have been under-explored (or not done so systematically) in the literature. One of these is the role of print journalism. In reaching out to the public through the print media, there are two key avenues in Singapore \u2013 articles in the best-selling local science magazine, the Singapore Scientist, and science-based articles in the national daily, The Straits Times.",

            "text": "The Singapore Scientist is a popular science magazine published by the Science Centre Singapore. It has been in publication since 1977 and has a readership of about 60,000. Its readers comprise mainly students, but copies of the magazines are also sent to the local institutes of higher learning as well as various government departments and statutory boards. The quarterly magazine is available for sale, mainly through subscriptions for students and direct sales through bookshops. Articles in the magazine come in various forms \u2013 for example, articles written by science centre staff and local academics on contemporary topics in science, quizzes, competitions (with prizes) and information about upcoming attractions at the science centre. As the magazine is printed in colour and on glossy paper, it is attractive from a design standpoint. Typically, it is of 50 pages in length. The efforts of popular science magazines also play a useful role in helping to enthuse the school-going public about the multifaceted splendours of science and technology. While somewhat different from other established popular science magazines, such as Popular Science and New Scientist, as the latter two are managed by full-time staff, inclusive of editorial, production and marketing teams, as well as having an international readership, the Singapore Scientist magazine relies almost totally on staff from the science centre to contribute most of the articles and take care of the editorial work and artwork. Profit is not the motive for publishing the magazine, popularising science is. Its circulation is also mainly local. Since the writing in the magazine is generally pitched at the level of school students, often difficult topics can be communicated in a way that they can reasonably understand. More importantly, the fact that a popular science magazine has been in production for over 35 years in Singapore without a full-time editorial and management team and with minimal reliance on advertisements is a testimony to its effectiveness in contributing to public science education in Singapore.",

The articles comprise those written by its own journalists as well as those provided by international wire services. The importance given to science can also be seen from the fact that a few reporters cover the local science and technology beat. Given the high circulation of the national newspaper, such articles do reach out to a good number of people in the country and contribute in some way to sensitising them about issues related to science and technology. It is, however, of concern that no study has so far explored the role of newspapers in science journalism in the Singapore context.",

It is an effective tool that can be used to analyse written text in books, newspapers and other printed documents (Krippendorff, 1980). The technique is regarded as labour intensive and time consuming since extensive coding schemes have to be developed for the analysis.

The term \u2018framing\u2019 refers to the \u2018modes of presentation that journalists and other communicators use to present information in a way that resonates with existing underlying schemas among their audience\u2019 (Scheufele & Tewksbury, 2007, p. 12). These authors also noted that the way an issue is depicted in a press article has a bearing on how the public would interpret it and form their opinions. Sometimes issues are complex to understand, and the reporters have to resort to particular perspectives in order to get the message across to readers. By giving a certain slant to an article, it is possible for a particular message to be conveyed to readers. The notion of \u2018frame sponsors\u2019 (Deprez & Raeymaeckers, 2010) or the participants selected to partake in the process of building the frame is also closely tied to legitimising the views of an article. It helps if the participants are in positions of authority so that they can lend some credibility to the news report (Wilkins, 1993). Content analysis can be used to study framing in a news article.",

While the subjects of biology and chemistry were able to elicit at least a few articles in the period surveyed, there was none whatsoever for physics. A few reasons can account for this. Firstly, it could be due to the limited time period surveyed. Secondly, there has been a marked decline in interest in physics among students at the secondary and postsecondary levels (Oon & Subramaniam, 2010), leading to a decline in undergraduate enrolment in physics at the local universities (Oon & Subramaniam, 2011). The lack of reporting of issues related to physics could well be a manifestation of this trend, that is, it is being perceived as being minimally newsworthy. Thirdly, and which is the most plausible reason in my opinion, is that physics has become very much embedded in many other disciplines, including technology, that its purveying per se is not really necessary to reinforce its importance. There is no technology in the medical, biological, chemical, computing and engineering fields that does not make use of some fundamental concepts grounded in physics. That is, there is an implicit, though not explicitly stated, manifestation of the influence of physics in the sciences. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is a need for more advocacy efforts by university staff in physics as well as members of learned societies in physics to raise the profile of physics in the newspapers.",

The provision of a large column space in a national newspaper for a leading legal academic to air his views about the Internet has the effect of raising the visibility of the issue for the various stakeholders. Likewise in the other article on how healthy outcomes can be promoted for people in this age of increasing health costs, the views of a health professional in the private sector were given valuable column space to generate publicity for the issue.

Though the column space devoted to these particular letters is either low or modest, the auspices of the forum page can have the effect of elevating it to a higher level of \u2018visibility\u2019 for the views professed in these letters. For example, the writer of the letter on \u2018Clogged drains: a dengue risk\u2019 demonstrates commendable civic activism as he recounted how he took photographs of stagnant water in parks and drains, which are potential sites for mosquito breeding, and sent these to the relevant national agency for the necessary action, which they duly took. As Singapore was encountering a dengue epidemic at that time, such actions show how other members of the public can contribute in similar ways to the cause of public health. It is well known that letters to the editor must pass through a few layers of scrutiny before they are accepted for publication in the newspaper. Nevertheless, even within the aegis of this \u2018mediated arena\u2019 (Zamith, Pinto, & Villar, 2013), it is a welcome development that the public raises issues related to science and technology and that the editors see value in publishing such perspectives for furthering the cause of public discourse.",

Likewise for terms such as vertebrates, spine, torso, fossils, traits and larva in biology, as well as terms such as current, momentum, electricity, LEDs, charge, batteries and power in physics. However, students are likely to find difficulties with more terms in biology than in chemistry or physics (Table 15.7). It is pertinent to note that one of the prime attributes of science literacy is the ability to understand scientific terms (Miller, 1983; Thomas & Durant, 1987). The baseline knowledge in science that schools provide students is adequate, and the onus is really more on students to increase their repertoire of scientific vocabulary and understanding of science topics through informal means in order to make greater sense of the science content presented in newspapers.",

With the mountains of garbage in most countries being either directly incinerated or dumped into landfills, the article on 20 April that a Singapore company is building a waste-to-energy plant in Britain is a reinforcement of the point that Singapore is one of the very few countries that have adopted environmentally friendly practices in waste disposal and that the experience in this initiative has led the company to land a contract to replicate the Singapore experience in the UK. Waste-to-energy plants are a new development in the waste industry \u2013 their principal advantage is that the enormous amounts of heat generated during incineration is captured and fed to the country\u2019s electricity grid rather than being allowed to go to waste, as is the practice in many countries (Tan & Subramaniam, 2012). The 20 April article on \u2018Indonesia fires bring haze to Singapore\u2019 is a timely reminder to Singaporeans of the environmental consequences that the action of one country can have on another and of the need to stay tuned to the three-hourly broadcasts of the Pollution Standards Index (PSI) readings. Even most of the articles from overseas also took on a news angle for their reporting. The article on \u2018Taiwan confirms first case of H7N9 outside mainland China\u2019, published on 25 April, is a poignant reminder (without explicitly stating it) to citizens to exercise caution and discretion when travelling to affected countries and reinforces the point that in this age of international travel, people and local health authorities need to stay vigilant. In the article on \u2018A can of soft drink a day ups diabetes risk by 22 %: Study\u2019, published on 25 April, a subliminal message is reinforced to people to take greater responsibility for their own health. Such education of the public about issues in science and technology would seem to be more effective if the message is relayed as a news story rather than as a direct exhortation couched in purely scientific terms with scarce regard for context. It may be pertinent to recall the work of Hijmans, Pleijter and Wester (2003), who have noted that the use of news items allows for relevant scientific knowledge to be slanted into a story for public consumption. This holds true for the articles in The Straits Times for the period surveyed.",

As mentioned earlier, of the 19 such articles, all made mention of some academic institution(s) or industry in the text. The positioning of an article in this manner may admit of a reportorial acknowledgement that greater authenticity could be endowed on the content if institutional actors are given some, albeit brief, column space. Thus, for example, in the article on \u2018Residents more worried about dengue\u2019, which appeared on 20 April, the Healthway Medical Group and the National Environment Agency earned mentions. It may not be prudent to feature such an article depicting people\u2019s concerns if major players in the big picture are left out and their views not sought. In another article on \u2018Boy burnt by liquid on seat of bus stop\u2019, which appeared on the same day, the name of the boy\u2019s school as well as the National University Hospital was mentioned. In the article on \u2018More sightings of wild otters in Singapore\u2019, which appeared on 22 April, there were mentions of the National University of Singapore, International Union for Conservation of Nature, the National Parks Board and the name of a wildlife consultant. The article on \u2018Mad about tulips\u2019, published on 24 April and which publicised the planting of the largest number of these flowers (20,000) in the country, had mentions of Temasek Junior College, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and the Netherlands Charity Association. In the article on \u2018LNG terminal will boost energy security\u2019, there was mention of a minister\u2019s name, the name of the international conference he graced and KPMG Global Energy Institute for Asia Pacific. Most of such articles have also a quote from an authoritative figure or the concerned actor. Quotations can be a proxy for depth of coverage of an issue \u2013 if the issue reported on is perceived to be important, the journalist is likely to solicit opinions from credible sources (Davidson & Wallack, 2004). It would seem that adherence to such \u2018norms\u2019 \u2013 that is, mention of institution and use of quotations \u2013 is generally a characteristic feature of science articles generated in the local context. It may be of interest to note that Dimopoulos and Koulaidis (2003) have found that the linkages of science and technology to the corresponding \u2018social actors\u2019 are a characteristic feature of science portrayal in the Greek press. In their study, however, the principal actors were mainly those related to the economy and politics, while in the present study, these were mainly national institutions. The difference could be due to a number of reasons \u2013 for example, journalistic inclination to include such actors in order to endow greater credibility for their write-up or greater integration of the institutional \u2018spheres of influence\u2019 (Dimopoulos & Koulaidis) into the wider science and technology landscape in Singapore as compared to Greece.",

The use of Prominence Index, which is of relatively recent origins, has been the subject of only very few studies. The results of the current study attest to the fact that more research is needed to explore the impact of an article through the use of Prominence Index.

Especially, newspapers are ideally positioned to communicate new developments in science and technology on a timescale that is not possible by science centres \u2013 for example, it requires time, resources and funding for science centres to mount exhibitions and other programmes on these developments, and some of these developments many not even be amenable to treatment via exhibitry, the principal tool used by science centres to communicate to the public. Since newspapers are published every day, they are in a position to educate the public about new developments in a time-effective manner. However, it has to be noted that given the breadth and scope of scientific disciplines as well as the rate at which new developments in science and technology are occurring, newspapers can cover only a minuscule fraction of what is happening. The fraction that is covered must pass several tests before it can muster editorial acceptance. For example, is the item newsworthy? Is it likely to appeal to a good number of readers? Are there other pressing news items competing for column space at the same time? Is the level of language used in the item amenable to comprehension by the lay public? Is advertising space, which brings in revenue, affected in the process? and so on. Thus, it is not surprising that only a limited number of topics can be covered in newspapers. The lack of a daily science section in The Straits Times is one reason why the scope of coverage of topics is still limited as compared to other newspapers such as The New York Times (Clark & Illman, 2006) and USA Today. The Straits Times, however, has a section devoted specifically to science and which appears on Sundays; both locally generated articles and those from wire services are featured in this section.",

Because of the latter, students, depending on their educational level, may sometimes lack the necessary scientific vocabulary or critical thinking to make sense of the content presented in some of the articles though they may be able to follow these to some extent. This is a challenge for science teachers to address as after all, one of the aims of science education is to make students become more discerning in their approach when reading news in the media, a skill that would be especially needed as they transition to adulthood.

The invoking of relevant articles in the press when teaching particular science topics in the class and coming up with appropriate activities that can provide meaningful learning experiences to students would be a possible approach. These activities can leverage on inquiry in the broad sense. It has to be reiterated that in the literature, there is no consensus on what exactly constitutes inquiry (e.g., Barrow, 2006). True inquiry is generally regarded as being promoted when students engage in tasks that mirror the work of scientists \u2013 for example, doing investigations in the laboratory. However, given the need to complete the curriculum in time and to allocate time for revision activities, there is a limit to how much time teachers can devote to inquiry activities for students in the true context of the word. The laboratory need not necessarily be the place, although it is highly desirable, to promote inquiry. In fact, Chiappetta (1997) notes that \u2018Scientific inquiry goes beyond constructing knowledge through hands-on activities. Much of the inquiry that scientists and engineers engage in involves reading and communicating with other people\u2019 (p. 25).",

            "text": "The classroom can thus be used to promote elements of inquiry to students \u2013 for example, use of questioning and crafting of activities that promote thinking without recourse to the laboratory environment. Questioning and thinking are two attributes that are used by scientists in their work, and these can be made the basis for promoting inquiry when using newspaper articles in the teaching of science. Some examples will now be given using the articles covered in The Straits Times. In using the article on \u2018LNG terminal will boost energy security\u2019, published on 26 April, for the teaching of chemistry, students can be given some tasks to do \u2013 for example, writing the chemical equation for the combustion of liquefied natural gas and comparing it with when petroleum products are combusted, and asking them to explain from the products formed why the former reaction is in line with clean energy initiatives; calculating the heat change for these reactions to see which reaction produces more energy; following the carbon trail for these fuels to study the effects of pollution; and doing simple cost-benefit analyses in respect of the fuels. Another article which appeared on the same day is \u2018Banned chemicals found in 3 cosmetic products\u2019. In using this article for the teaching of chemistry, students can be asked to look into the properties of mercury, hydroquinone, salicylic acid and tretinoin from the point of view of its effect on human physiological systems and find out what is the critical concentration beyond which each of these chemicals can pose a risk to human health; by correlating these concentrations with those found in the cosmetic products, they can see why the authorities have banned these products. In line with the recommendations of Jarman and McClune (2007, 2010), further activities can be promoted when using press articles for the teaching of science in class \u2013 for example, engaging students in a brief question-and-answer session based on the article, promoting general discussion of the article and asking students questions such as what aspects that would allow them to make greater sense of the text are missing from the article; if given an opportunity, what would they want to ask the reporter who wrote the article; and what topics in the syllabus have allowed them to reasonably understand the article. Also, students could be given opportunities to write up a science topic taught in class (and which is covered in the newspaper) as a press article with catchy headlines and word limit (Jarman & McClune, 2002).",

            "text": "The interdisciplinary nature of contemporary science and technology is a theme that resonates in most articles. In schools, however, science is taught as separate subjects \u2013 for example, physics, chemistry and biology. Where combined science is taught at the secondary level, its division into the respective sciences is still made apparent in the syllabus or in the class during teaching \u2013 for example, subject combinations include physics/chemistry, chemistry/biology or physics/biology. Students need to realise that the natural world is interdisciplinary in nature and that these artificial divisions are made for pedagogical convenience and administrative reasons. Science-based articles in newspaper offer tremendous potential to reiterate this point. For example, in the article on \u2018Indonesia fires bring haze to Singapore\u2019 which appeared on 20 April, a number of subject domains will be apparent \u2013 the slight changes in the composition of the atmosphere due to the presence of colloidal particles as well as the reduced visibility arising from these can be linked to chemistry; forest clearing via burning to make a way for development can be linked to earth science; deforestation contributing to reduced transpiration and photosynthesis has implications in biology; and the body parts affected as a result of such pollution can be related to biology or medicine. In the article on \u2018Banned chemicals found in 3 cosmetic products\u2019, linkages can be made to not only chemistry but also biology. Such articles can be used to infuse not only real-world contexts of a contemporary nature in the course of teaching traditional science but also reinforce to students the cross-disciplinary nature of modern science.",

The article on \u2018Golden age of citizen cartography\u2019, published on 21 April, is a good example of what Shapin (1992) terms \u2018science-in-the-making\u2019 (p. 29) \u2013 how groups of people separated by distance were able to collaborate over the Internet to create new knowledge, specifically producing an accurate digital map of a part of the country, such as a village. Yet another example of science-in-the-making and which reinforces the point that the scientific enterprise is a complex social activity in which multiple institutions as well as the public participate is the article on \u2018War on cancer: US institutions race to map patients\u2019 genes\u2019, which was published on 23 April.",

Given the demands of the school science curriculum and the administrative responsibilities of teachers as well as the perceived benefits of the nexus between school science and newspaper science, its use in lessons must not be construed as an add-on but as one which is integrated into classroom teaching. Otherwise, there is a risk that its introduction would be seen more in the context of an appendage that can be conveniently off-loaded for the resumption of normal teaching. A recent study conducted by Poon, Toh and Tan (2010) in a primary science classroom in Singapore used the format of a debate to extend what students learn about the interdependence of species in an ecosystem to an issue of contemporary significance reported in an international news media \u2013 the declining bee population; the students were able to obtain useful insights on the issue as a result of linking classroom content with real-world contexts.",

However, there is a case for doing so, especially in this age of globalisation and new developments in science and technology. Indeed, the seminal report on \u2018Beyond 2000: Science education for the future\u2019 by Millar and Osborne (1998) has called for the science curriculum to be reformed so as to address the challenge of helping students to \u2018be able to understand and respond critically to media reports of issues with a science component\u2019 (p. 12). These ideas also resonate in the literature on \u2018science for citizenship\u2019 (Osborne, 2000) and lifelong learning (e.g., Solomon & Thomas, 1999). Jarman and McClune (2002) also opine that since articles in newspapers are generally pitched at the level of the \u2018nonscience audience\u2019, these would be especially useful for classroom teaching. It would be pertinent to conclude this section by quoting Elliott (2006) in his study of trainee teachers in a university in the UK:If even people such as these do not regularly follow scientific developments and debate in newspapers, what hope is there that less scientifically minded, scientifically educated, or academic peers do? This makes the case for introducing newspaper science in school classes even stronger. If school students can be given opportunities to read media reports of science and helped to understand and critically evaluate them, there is a chance that more will take up this habit into their adult lives.
