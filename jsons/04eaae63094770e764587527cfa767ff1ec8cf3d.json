In fact, its original mission was ambiguous as it was designed for \"the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health, listing thereafter some 22 \"wide-range functions, of which the first was to 'act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work'\" (Clift 2013: 6) . Thus, until 1969 , the role of the WHO, contained in its original mission, was confined to fighting a few infectious diseases, such as cholera, smallpox, yellow fever, guinea worm disease, onchocerciasis, and the six most common infectious diseases, particularly affecting children-diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), measles, tuberculosis and poliomyelitis-and plague, and the reporting requirement, which \"ultimately failed to generate compliance by WHO member countries\" (Johnson 2011) . The original focus continued to expand, however, so that by 2005, WHO member states were asked \"not only [to] report but also to prevent and control any disease that presents a significant harm to humans, and surveillance for pandemics,\" covering infectious diseases. Thus, the WHO mission even by 2002, had expanded exponentially, and included (Ling 2002): establishing and maintaining administrative and technical services in member countries, such as epidemiological and statistics services; stimulating the eradication of diseases; improving nutrition, housing, sanitation, working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; promoting cooperation among scientific and professional groups; proposing international conventions and agreements on human matters; conducting research; developing international standards for food; and informing public opinion among all people on matters of health.",

The latter has been a major shift from 1948, the time when some had described the agency's mission as restricted to providing \"technical consultancy to national health ministries and international agencies, promoting the best practices to combat the worst diseases\" (Bollyky 2012) . Currently, the issue of chronic or non-communicable diseases, or lifestyle diseases, such as cancers, diabetes, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, vehicular injuries, crime, and corruption, tobacco use, and drug trafficking, which are growing at an alarming rate in the developing world and have become the leading causes of death and disability almost everywhere in the world, are a part of the WHO's overarching responsibility. This demands application of \"evidence-based ideas, and global surveillance, technical assistance, and international coordination that can support countries' effective and sustained implementation\" (Bollyky 2012) .",

Unfortunately, politics have been a distractive and, at times, destructive force within the WHO itself, particularly on the issue of dues. We are often reminded, as someone dramatically put it, that, \"The poor countries [have] said 'we cannot afford to do anything. The middle income countries [have] said 'we do not like the rich guys telling us what to do.' And the rich countries [have] said 'we have our own polities, why should we listen to WHO?' So, all the policy outcomes were eliminated\" (Johnson 2011: 4) . Politics in the WHO are also centered on the power of the big Western nations that try to control the agenda and the strategies which are often forced on the less powerful nations, while exerting pressure to ensure that the WHO does not place too much emphasis on people's rights to health. As renowned epidemiologist Laurie Garrett wrote, there is the impression that a rich country, \"like the US, uses its funding leverage to continually pressure the WHO to steer clear of 'macroeconomics and trade issues that it says are outside its scope, and to avoid such terminology as 'the right to health'\" (see Johnson 2011) .",

International politics also caused China to block Taiwan's membership of the WHO. Unfortunately, the WHO could not do anything in the face of the avian flu because it can only share the protocols but cannot force any member state to comply with its requests, even though it knew that China was not at the time in a position of develop a vaccine against the flu. This is the reason why many experts wished \"international health regulations would give the WHO more leverage during the transnational emergencies\" (Johnson 2011) . Several developing countries would most likely side with China's attitude because quite often Western pharmaceuticals focus on drugs or vaccines that will benefit primarily the West-ones that result in financial profit-just as is the case with the attempts at finding a vaccine for HIV/AIDS in Africa, where the West has been testing the HIV subtype B when the predominant strain in East Africa is HIV sub-type C. The reason is that, if they discover the vaccine for the African strain, this would not be as lucrative because it would not serve the interests of the West, which would therefore not buy it.",

On the budget, it is clear that the WHO is being overtaken by many philanthropic organizations that do not depend on member state donors, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and even PEPFAR provided by the US. These shortcomings are aggravated by the inefficiency and timidity in the use of the funds allocated for health across the globe. Indeed, instead of increasing, the WHO's budget has been shrinking dramatically since 2008. From 1990 to 2012, the overall level of global aid seems to have increased fourfold, reaching $22 billion annually, while that of the agency remained $1 billion, and continued to decline or remained static thereafter (Bollyky 2012) . Indeed, 80% of the WHO budget comes from private and public donations and not from member states' dues.",

For example, the UN sought to raise some $600 million in emergency funds to battle the Ebola virus outbreak for its most important agency. Critics also say that the WHO is over-reaching and at times gets involved in issues of health that can be best handled by regional officers and professional personnel of the member states themselves, who can manage their own services, and be partners, and not merely patrons in the WHO's efforts to improve global health and eradicate disease. In Bollyky's opinion, the developing world needs only technical support and data on the best global practices so they can perform more effectively locally. The operative words are \"reliance on local leadership\" that ensures that \"technical professionals resident in the various members states take over most operations and administer the budget, which is often used to pay unnecessary staff that is constantly traveling. This would save the few scarce resources it musters. The budget reduction that began in 2008 resulted in the loss of 35% of the agency's personnel.",

The agency should also focus on its ability to engage in scaling up emergency measures that might have save the lives of thousands of people. Ebola, one the most deadly virus the world has ever seen, can be contained, as was the case several times since its first outbreak in 1976. The Communications Director of MSF, Jason Cone, has noted that the inability of the agency to contain the outbreak during a period of six months indicates the existence of a \"huge vacuum in leadership\" that it cannot fill, compelling, as well, President of MSF Joanne Liu to confess at the time that the world was losing the battle to contain the outbreak and, therefore, could not coordinate the international response (Gaist 2014: 1) . The interjection of politics, as mentioned earlier, does not help the WHO image either. Its hiring practices across the globe have been criticized for cronyism and unethical practices that seem to favor friends and those who are inclined to accept unprofessional demands to advance their careers, even though most of these charges are often based on hearsay and innuendo. The British would like to see the WHO given the mandate of simply \"preparing a strategy for global health governance,\" while others suggest that the Secretariat in Geneva take over control over WHO's \"resources for health programs\" (Johnson 2011: 6) .",

The quick containment of SARS, a major target of the WHO and the Western world, despite the refusal of the Chinese to share samples of the virus at first, has been a triumph of the most respected UN agency (Water 2005) . Also to be remembered is the flu pandemic H1N1-the first one in 40 years in 2009-which showed the critical role the WHO has played over the years. Prevention of vertical transmission of HIV to the fetus and the announcement of clear guidelines on the merits of baby breastfeeding constitute one of the most successful projects undertaken by the WHO. The fight against HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, called the \"Big Three\" in Africa, is being won, though slowly, but people are now able to live with HIV for decades because of new therapies, proving that having HIV is no longer a death sentence.",

Significantly, the WHO's turn towards mental disorders as serious illnesses is a move in the right direction, given that Africans have so far paid very little attention to the problem. Included in the arena tackled by the WHO are oral hygiene, veterinary science, occupational safety, special care for the elderly, and the fight against tobacco use, particularly among minors (see Oluwafemi 2014: 27) .

After chronicling the history and development of the agency, the Center stresses that the major challenge for WHO has come from the World Bank's involvement in the health sector \"on a large scale\" during the 1980s and the proliferation of a number of health initiatives thereafter, which placed in jeopardy the agency's authority in directing and coordinating health issues at hand, given that some of the new actors have a larger budget than this UN organization. The WHO also found itself challenged by the emerging new and old diseases, coupled with the alarming increase in non-communicable diseases and the impending threats of more epidemics, which underscored its weaknesses and its inability to act more effectively as the Ebola virus proved in Africa. These developments raised more questions about its future, especially in reference to its structures and operations. What is acknowledged, though, is that the WHO succeeded in placing centerstage the proposition that health was a human right and that social issues that cause or contribute to health inequalities should constitute a serious concern for all member states.",

In addition, as Clift writes, \"The challenge to WHO lay in competition in the sphere of policy where World Bank thinking, grounded in macroeconomics and neo-liberal ideas, was a sophisticated response to WHO's position grounded in the thinking of health professionals as exemplified by \"Health for All,\" all of which contributed to a clash of philosophy and therapeutics as approaches to health. Finally, though praising the constitutionally framed structure, critics point to the agency's actual function, which, according to them, \"is wrought with serious and complex problems of constitutional, political, managerial, and programmatic nature.\" The comment is applied in practice to the agency's interaction with the regional offices, the \"centerpiece of \"One WHO.\" This aspect has received mixed reviews from those who criticize the agency's management style and the nature of relations on the ground. Although some of the criticism may have some merit, it is often based on personal opinion couched in subjective information. Indeed, it would be a miracle, if an organization of such import and longevity as the WHO, which has to deal on a daily basis with issues of global relations and budget matters, particularly in time of want and recession, were not criticized for one reason or another. Criticizing is cheap but providing convincing solutions, based on the best practices available, is not an easy task. However, this is not to deny the reality that an organization that does not adjust to changing times cannot survive. OGAC would also coordinate US Government-supported HIV/ AIDS programs in developing countries. According to the legislation, the Executive Branch was to come up with and implement a \"comprehensive, integrated, five-year strategy to combat HIV/AIDS that strengthens the capacity of the United States to be an effective leader in the international campaign against AIDS (P.L. 2003) .

All agencies involved have their own objectives and strategies, which render the responsibilities of the recipient countries more complex. As one looks at the official outcomes of PEPFAR, one is not provided with the details related to screening and testing, the rule that mandates abstinence-until-marriage, free distribution of condoms, and the funder's veiled requirement that all African males be circumcised to apparently end HIV transmission from sexual activity with uncircumcised men. This reflects the Congress disdain for the use of condoms as an unchristian practice, thus attaching religious ideologies to the provision of health care. The same applies to abstinence-only-until-marriage, with the still unsubstantiated claim that it reduces sexual activity, especially among the young. Studies in the US itself have proven that, no matter what you tell young men and women, even at the point of forcing them to sign a pledge, the mandate does not work, as proven by many broken pledges made by high school kids or even children from religiously fanatic households.",

Some of them confessed that they wish their church pastors had done a better job preparing them for navigating this aspect of marriage. (Culp-Presser 2014: 1) Thus, several researchers and activists have criticized the waste of resources when federal or private grants aimed at enforcing or persuading the youngsters not to engage in sex before marriage. As for Africa, African youngsters are known to be actively engaged in sex, especially in the urban areas, just as is the case in the US. Furthermore, there have been studies in countries such as Uganda, where high school students are more afraid of getting pregnant than contracting an HIV infection because of the consequences: Pregnant students are not only being chastised and even expelled from the households but also forced to drop out of school if they show signs of pregnancy, the latter being a terrible outcome of a mistake given the thirst for education on the continent. Even though laws about forcing students to leave school are changing, they are not changing fast enough, and family traditions tend to continue even when it is to the detriment of the household and the future of a child.",

On the final results of the policy, the jury is still out despite the few studies conducted during the mid-2000s suggesting that circumcisions would prevent by 60% the transmission of HIV from man to woman or from man to man. This researcher witnessed the gathering of dozens of children between the ages of four and 12, Christian, Muslim, and traditional in religion, being brought to a hospital in Uganda to be taught the merits and advantages of male circumcision. Lectures were followed by the actual circumcisions sponsored by USAID. Some of the children who had undergone the \"Western baptized ritual\" could hardly walk to the vehicle that took them back to their parents' home. The not-for-profit Circumcision Research Center in the US under the direction of psychologist and educator Ronald Goldman disputes virtually all the claims made by the studies regarding the protective operations. Its Director is convinced that the studies done in Africa are flawed, cannot be valid, he says, because the facts tell us the contrary and that African children in one area of the world, such as Africa, should not be equated with those in other areas, such as the US, given the cultural differences and the socio-economic environment.",

He mentions the fact that the various so-called \"scientific\" and \"objective\" studies tend not to consider the role of culture and that surgery in African Western-medical facilities increases the chances of HIV infection through the use of contaminated or non-sterilized tools. Goldman also convincingly argues that circumcision causes immense pain in infants, to the point that some faint and many develop post-traumatic stress as they reach the age of six years.

Second, it diverts human and financial resources into a single strategy that could be better used in other more effective strategies. Most African countries, for instance, lack physicians and nurses who are so badly needed to provide HAART treatments and other kinds of care; these countries also lack finances for their health care systems. In such a context, using scarce resources for a strategy that is unlikely to have a major population-level impact is questionable. Third, because circumcision has deep social, cultural, and emotional implications, MMC cannot be imposed on men; individuals must freely choose circumcision, so that population coverage will likely be below. Fourth, MMC on a large scale may have deleterious unintended consequences, ranging from infection to mild or moderate mutilations; these consequences are often disregarded in cost/benefits analyses. Fifth, MMC and HIV control strategy may encourage more dangerous practices. (Garenne et al. 2013: 197-198) Perhaps, they speculate, circumcising boys before the age of the first sexual intercourse is a better practice, as it gives them the right to choose whether or not to be circumcised, but they also add that parents and others would fight the strategy as a violation of children's human rights. On circumcision, Bouhdiba relies on a study done in Uganda among 6,800 respondents who seemed to have found that only 7% of the circumcised were HIV positive contrasted to 16% of the non-circumcised.

In January 2000, whatever the true motives were, the G8 met in a conference in Okinawa and conceived and agreed to the formation of this organization to wipe out AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria off the face of the earth. It is the most noble idea not only due to the hugeness of its chest funds but also to the goal and the unique way the Fund was to be organized and administered to countries of the developing world in particular. The exciting generous idea was accepted without reticence in 2001 by the UN and its Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, who saw it as a winning proposition that would help Africa in particular where the three infectious diseases were most devastating. Subsequently, in 2002, he himself contributed $100,000 out of his own pocket to the fund. GFATM is a multi-billion dollar international \"financing mechanism\" aiming at making the globe better for everyone in health including reduction of poverty.

The structure of the organization is in general terms simple. It is made up of a Secretariat whose offices are located in always strategic and safe Geneva, Switzerland, which carries out the day-to-day operations of GFATM. It is funded by public and private organizations, businesses, foundations, individuals such as the UN Secretary-General, interested communities, and any philanthropic organization. The decisions on grants to countries are made by an international Board of Directors composed of 20 voting and eight non-voting members, which is assisted by a Technical Review Panel that uses its expertise to advise about which countries and which proposals merit funding. The Board is assisted by three Board Committees that have \"decision making, advisory, and oversight functions.\"",

However, the task was monumental, and, by the 1990s, the agency was overwhelmed with the responsibilities, time, and energy the mission required. Thus, in 1993, members of the WHO's World Health Assembly (WHA) recommended that the task be entrusted to a new agency of the UN, which would work with other UN agencies to take over its responsibility. Subsequently, the named agencies and the Economic and Social Council of UN agreed with the recommendation. In January 1996, the six cosponsors, UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, WHO, and the World Bank, were joined by UNDCP in April 1999 to create UNAIDS.

TB is still the leading cause of death among people with HIV/AIDS in the world, but, unfortunately for Africa, 80% of the people living with HIV/ AIDS and TB are in Sub-Saharan Africa. The report adds that, in some parts of the African Region, 82% of them live with a TB condition. Annual deaths from AIDS-related causes decreased worldwide from a peak of 2.3 million in 2005 to an estimated 1.7 million in 2011, and the accelerated access to treatment has had its greatest impact in Sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 550,000 (or 31%) fewer people died from AIDSrelated causes in 2011 than in 2005 when the number of deaths peaked (UNAIDS 2012: 24) . Because of increased access to HIV treatment, the number of people dying annually from AIDS-related causes fell from its peak of 1.8 million in 2005 to 1.2 million in 2011, with most of the deaths occurring in Southern Africa. However, in North Africa (and the Middle East in general) the number of people dying of AIDS rose from 14,000 in 2001 to 25,000 in 2011 (UNAIDS 2012: 24) .",

The successes are visible: In 2011, 1.4 million people were receiving more antiretroviral treatment in low-and middle-income countries than the previous year (UNAIDS 2012: 19) . The UNAIDS Report further notes that \"The most dramatic progress has been in Sub-Saharan Africa, where treatment coverage increased by 19% between 2010 and 2011. In addition, at least 745,000 people were receiving antiretroviral therapy in high-income countries.\" Encouraging is also the fact that low-and middle-income countries' resources put at their disposal a record $8.6 billion for AIDS spending in 2011,which included such countries as Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa. China has pledged to contribute more to offset any changes in the formula for resource allocation in the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS. This change is balanced by the hope that, by 2015, the international community will reach the UNAIDS $22-$24 billion request to combat AIDS.",

Mr. Yayi Boni writes encouragingly in UNAIDS Report 2012 that he was working closely with all African leaders to develop a roadmap for shared responsibility with concrete milestones for funding, for access to medicines that must imperatively be produced locally in Africa, for enhanced regulatory harmonization and for improved governance. The roadmap will outline the roles and responsibilities of governments, regional economic communities, African institutions, people living with and affected by HIV and our development partners. (Boni, UNIAIDS Report 2012) If all these strategies and plans have to be enacted in Africa now, one wonders why they have been absent over the past almost 20 years and why have the heads of state and governments \"not gotten their act together.\" This brings us back to the issue of leadership commitment and vision that seems to be lacking or rare on the continent of Africa, while resources are being officially appropriated, at least on paper.

GAVI does not simply distribute its funds to needy countries but it also requires that they contribute some of their national budget to the effort to acquire vaccines, and it expects them to increase the contribution should their annual GDP rise, while it provides and shares its expertise, funding, and experience. Even though pledges often change or pledging countries and partners may not contribute in time or the amount promised, GAVI has an international pledge of $8 billion for immunization for the period 2000-2017 to benefit mostly the poorest countries, of which most are found in Sub-Saharan Africa. Between 2000 and 2005, GAVI received $1 billion, which was a major accomplishment, given the many philanthropic organizations and countries asking for assistance to improve the health of their citizens and other human needs. The organization is optimistic that the good will and generosity of donors will continue in the future. Its major partners include the WHO, which has supported the regulation of vaccines and facilitated its use in poor countries, expanding the number of vaccinations and immunizations, while also insisting on the collection of necessary and accurate health data. UNICEF helps in the production of vaccines and ensures that developing countries are able to maintain their cold chain and enhances access. The World Bank, which initiated the International Finance Facility for Immunization, the Rockefeller Foundation, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (which gave $750 million in the initial stage), as well as several research and public health institutions throughout the world are involved in the goals espoused by GAVI (WHO, GAVI 2014).",

GAVI has made available some 11 life supporting vaccines in 73 of the poorest countries in the world, whose majority is found in Africa, and has waged war against diarrhea and pneumonia, considered to be the two biggest killers of children in the world. The organization has also been in the forefront toward the dramatic reduction of the price of vaccines in the developing countries, and has been instrumental in providing new vaccines quicker to the countries that need them, resulting in increased immunization rates all over the globe. GAVI also wishes the world to know that, by saving so many lives, it has contributed economically to the prevention of infectious diseases through billions of dollars over the past 14 years. Its mission continues to resonate throughout the world, where nearly still 22 million children, concentrated in the poor countries, go unvaccinated against at least six of the vaccine-preventable diseases, namely, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae, and against pneumococcal disease and rotavirus, which are the most responsible for pneumonia and diarrhea, as well as the human papilloma virus which causes cervical cancer.",

The sad part of the equation is that 3 million people die for vaccine-preventable diseases worldwide each year, half of whom are children under-five (WHO, GAVI 2014: 1). This was the major reason why the Alliance decided to establish itself, as it also realized that it is cheaper financially as well (only $17 per child against the six child killer diseases, with a little more to cover Hepatitis B, yellow fever, and Haemophilus influenzae type B, recommended by the WHO in 2002) than to let children die or try to cure them. The savings can then be used wisely toward the eradication of other diseases and the reduction of poverty. Incidentally, it is estimated that the eradication of smallpox in 1977-1979, saved the world some $275 million a year. GAVI wished to reverse the growing trend of lower immunization coverage in many countries, which fell to 74% in 1999 from 80% in 1990 and galvanize international resolve to vaccinate children nationally and regionally.",

Unfortunately, disparities exist between county and country, region and region, and between urban and rural areas. GAVI estimates that \"a child in an industrialized country receives eleven vaccines on average, while a child from a developing country is lucky to receive half that number\" (WHO, Global Alliance 2014). By the way, GAVI is not to be confused with the Global Fund for Children's Vaccines, which is an independent financial institution created by GAVI, whose function is to raise funds for immunization in developing countries, as recommended by its Board. Unlike many organizations that spend a large amount of funds on administrative costs to the detriment of the health programs, GAVI spends 98% of its funds on vaccinations and immunization related programs.

For every one familiar with conditions in the field, child immunization is only one of backbreaking press of challenges, and the introduction of new and improved children's vaccines has by no means been the most urgent\u2026 The GAVI champions immunization, and yet [continues Muraskin], its core constituents-field workers and developing countries' governments-have been unenthusiastic supporters of that goal\u2026Although bilateral donors have been among the nations most committed to the struggle for equity for all children in the developing world, they have had doubts as to whether vaccination is the best means of achieving that goal. The same reservation alienated bilateral donors from a previous vaccine alliance, the Children's Vaccine Initiative, and made them its chief critic. (Muraskin 2004: 3) The criticism probably has some validity as, over the years, many other organizations have behaved as if they knew better the needs of the communities they decide to help than the nationals themselves, and have acted arrogantly and dictatorial on priorities and on how things should be run.

The Great Powers under US leadership at the Bretton Woods Conference, New Hampshire, ensured that two most powerful financial institutions in the world be owned and operated by member states. However, the two institutions seem to be so similar in purpose, as they are seen as the \"intergovernmental [twin] pillars supporting the structure of the world's economic and financial order,\" confusing many people, including the experts, about their mission. David D. Driscoll notes that \"even John Maynard Keynes, a founding father of the two institutions and considered by many the most brilliant economist of the twentieth century, admitted at the inaugural meeting of the International Monetary Fund that he was confused by the names: He thought the Fund should be called a bank, and the Bank should be called a fund. Confused has reigned ever since\" (Driscoll 1996: 1) .",

One of the major requirements of IMF's loans recipients is the pledge for their \"national currencies to be exchanged without restrictions for the currencies of other member countries\" (Driscoll 1996: 7) . By May 1996, 115 members had embraced \"the monetary policy of full convertibility of their national currencies.\" This number has grown ever since. On the contrary, the World Bank is a huge financial institution, with headquarters in Washington, D.C. The twin institutions focus primarily on protecting and assisting the economies of the member states with the ultimate goal of preventing global economic depression and recession as happened in October 1929, the devastating economic impact of the two World Wars, and the recession of the 1980s. The rise in oil prices and interest rates as well as the fall of prices, forced many developing countries to approach the World Bank and the IMF to borrow money, much of which was to \"service a growing debt burden\" (Jim Lobe 2003: 1).",

Actually, when the IMF was created in 1944, its mission was to foster international economic cooperation and allow member states to borrow short-term loans \"so that they could trade with other countries\" to achieve a balance of payments. However, during the 1980s, the institution assumed a different mission, that of \"bailing out countries\" in financial crisis by providing an emergency loan package attached to its structural adjustments conditions (Global Exchange 2011). Yet, despite all similarities, the two are distinct: The World Bank, which is present in 100 countries, with an approximately staff of 10,600, is essentially an investment bank, a development institution that borrows money from investors and lends it to borrowers, while the IMF, similar to a credit union that allows members to borrow funds when needed for a particular purpose, is not a bank but \"a cooperative institution\" whose mission is to \"maintain an orderly system of payments and receipts between nations.\" Both institutions assist only member states and not individuals as foundations usually do. Yet, each has its own structure, gets funding from different sources, \"assists different categories of members, and strives to achieve distinct goals through methods peculiar to itself\" (Driscoll 1996: 2) . The World Bank may sell bonds and notes it can lend to member governments, their agencies, and central banks. The proceeds are loaned to developing countries at some of the lowest rates, favoring the poorest as a proportion of their degree of poverty.",

The by-laws of the institutions require an 85% majority vote to change any of its articles. Japan is next in the number of shares owned, 6.27% in the IMF and 7.8% in the World Bank. Interestingly, highlighting the power of the US, it alone can appoint the President of the World Bank, while holding a permanent seat among its executive directors. The World Bank's Board of Directors based in Washington, D.C., has 25 executive directors, 19 from the WHO, and holds, on the average, two meetings a week to monitor the operations, assesses loans and guarantees, policies the budget and strategies, and makes decisions on borrowing and the institutions' finances (World Bank Group 2013: 3).

Unfortunately, the latter was Ghana's major source of revenue, followed by reductions in health and education spending; exports and imports rates were reduced, ballooning the 1980 $1.4 billion external debt to $7.0 billion in 1999. With the relaxation of environmental concerns at the hand of private Western companies, air and water pollution increased, malaria spread, along with other diseases such as TB and silicosis, and stories of corruption due to water privatization appeared in the papers. Ismi dramatizes the situation by noting that: \"The World Bank's structural adjustment of Ghana is a textbook example of how to ruin a country. The ruthless denial of mineral wealth, food, medical care, education, and even water, has made the population destitute spectators of the plunder of Ghana by foreigners\" (Ismi 2004) . Cote d'Ivoire is another classic example of failure under the SAPs that serious studies have singled out. Its external debt rose by $3.7 billion in 1989-1991, increasing from 132% to 210.8% of GDP. Under the IMF and World Bank terms in 1989, Cote d'Ivoire had to cut government spending by 30%, capital costs by 15%, increase taxes, privatize state enterprises, and, like in Ghana, \"deregulate the labor market, reduce the civil service, eliminate price controls, devalue the currency, and enact trade and financial reforms\" (Naiman and Watkins, 1999: 12-13) . The consequences were devastating: poverty doubled between 1988 and 1995, from 17.8% to 36.8%; public health and education allocations were slashed by more than 35% for both by 1995; children's' stunted growth went from 20% in 1988 to 35% in 1995, much of it due to the introduction of user fees, according to some sources.",

The IMF imposed structural violence on developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s though neoliberal and macroeconomic reforms that intensified individual and communal vulnerability to infection and dismantled already weak health systems. Those same policies, now repackaged but fundamentally the same, continue to prioritize low inflation, constricted government spending, robust currency reserves, and prompt repayment of debt at the expense of needed investment in health and more expansionary, pro-growth and job-creation economic policies. (Baker 2010: 348) A study done by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office in 29 Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 1999-2005 reported that \"37% of all annual aid increases was diverted to building currency reserves and that 37% was devoted to domestic debt repayment,\" leaving only 27% of the annual assistance to health education, infrastructure, and other needs, such as poverty alleviation (Baker 2010: 351) . Repaying the chronic debt, dependence on Western consultants and project directors embedded in bilateral or multilateral agreements that do not focus on technological and knowledge transfer, importation of luxury goods and cheapest goods from abroad, such as soap, cooking oil, coffee, clothes, harmful cigarettes, and health drugs, when they can be produced locally, constitute anomalies that have retarded Africa.

As consistently noted in this volume, the issue of Africa's leadership is crucial. As long as we have presidents and ministers of the various departments who seem to show little commitment to the plight of their citizens, and are unable to stand up when needed against the imposition of terms of development by the big financial corporations, pharmaceuticals, and expatriates who think they know better what Africa needs than the Africans themselves, nothing will change. The priorities in Africa are clear: ensuring that people have adequate and quality nutrition; provision of education for all citizens; making health accessible to all, as agreed at Alma-Ata in 1978; building and rebuilding the infrastructure; revolutionizing agriculture; and strengthening the industrial effort. Ismi, of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, echoes these ideas when he suggests six strategies for the future of Africa: participation of the poor, the vulnerable, farmers, rural populations, workers, women, and the underserved, and not just the elite, in critical decisions and policies adopted; some \"redistribution\" of wealth (a concept and word rejected by the neo-liberals and those who believe only in market forces and trickle down theories); promotion of agriculture to increase production and feed and protect farmers from cheap imports and provide credit and subsidies to poor farmers who are unable to compete with the major corporations resulting from privatization policies; concerted work towards a strong industrial base, diversified manufacturing to generate more jobs for Africans; regional integration to accelerate reliance on local and regional products that will benefit directly or indirectly international and domestic output in industry and agriculture; and \"South-South\" cooperation rather than the current domination of the West and its multinational corporations over the continent of Africa.",

The study was jointly conducted by the Bank and an international group of non-governmental organizations called the Structural Adjustment Participatory Review Initiative Network. In it, the joint opinion of the participating institutions and organizations conclude that: \"poverty has been further deepened by the inability of the poor to access essential services at affordable rates, which was disputed by the two international financial organizations\" (Third World Network 2002). The study also noted that the 42 poorest countries in Africa had lost 50% spending on health care during the 1990s, and that they were spending more on repaying the debt than on health or education. It is apparent as well that privatization of health care has moved health from the public to the private sphere through user fees, private insurance schemes, and privatization of medical consultations and treatment. Phillip Michael has argued that, though the IMF emphasis on \"earn more\" and \"spend less\" might make it seem that it helps repaying the loans, through the dependency that sets in, structural adjustment affects health care negatively through the closing of health facilities and preventing the hiring of more staff, or staffing them with \"inexperienced health providers\" (Michael 2004; Peet 2003) .",

The coefficients for this variable are positive and statistically significant. We argue that this may be the case because the IMF requires Sub-Saharan African nations to cut spending on health services. (Pandolfelli et al. 2014: 135) The 1995-2005 study included 36 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, namely: Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Pandofelli and his colleagues (2014: 137) estimated that the difference between not being under the IMF SAP and being subjected to it would result in much higher maternal death rates per 100,000 live births and many more infant deaths per 100,000. In other words, some 360 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births had occurred under the SAPs over the same period and that, therefore, evidence supported the claim that, in Sub-Saharan Africa, maternal mortality rates are higher among the countries that accepted the World Bank (and the IMF) conditions for a loan (Encyclopedia of Nations 1971).",

As John Rawls theorized many years ago (1971), as long as there is no equal opportunity to resources and social positions and the freedom to use them to one's advantage, as long as Africa understands that good systems and not persons, leaders, managers, and politicians are the most important prerequisites for good health on the continent, and that the fight against disease should not be focused only on decreasing mortality to increase longevity, progress in people's health will be minimal. In fact, a health system without gross inequalities in access to resources must guarantee that the most disadvantaged are the most advantaged when resources are available.",

Meanwhile, funds allocated to the army remained high, as was the case in peaceful Guinea, where it was 29% of the national budget between 1980 and 1990, contrasted to 3% for health, demonstrating the skewed policy of the leaders (Niang 2008: 37) . Linked to the inequities exacerbated by the SAPs in Africa, the World Bank estimated in 1993 that 20% of the poorest in Africa received 10% of the public subsidies in health, while 20% of the wealthiest received 25% of subsidies-women, the majority of the poor, benefitting the least in the distribution of health resources. Women and children were the hardest hit by the required IMF structural adjustments. In his study on the SAPs in Kenya, Damaris Parsitau found a \"direct link\" between the adjustments and the deteriorating health of women in Kenya, mainly as a result of the imposed reduction in the health budget.

The MSF Secretariat-General is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. The top officers consist of the International President, the Secretary-General, the International Medical Secretary, the Executive Coordinator (not Director), and the Executive Assistant. Its charter defines the organization as \"an international, independent, medical humanitarian organization that delivers emergency aid to people affected by armed conflict, epidemics and natural disasters,\" regardless of race, religion, gender or political affiliation. Indeed, MSF focuses its efforts on alleviating suffering caused by war or any other type of violent conflict and natural calamities, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, rape and torture, abuse, neglect, poverty, and lack of respect for human and citizen's rights on the domestic, international, and global arena. Currently, MSF is organized into 19 sections, 24 associations, and other offices, which are spread over some 70 countries, most of which in the developing world, including Africa. Worldwide, it boasts some 35,000 volunteers, physicians, nurses, journalists, logisticians, lab technicians, scientists, administrators, epidemiologists, mental health experts, and water and sanitation professionals, a far cry from its beginning in 1971 when it had only 300 volunteers. MSF relies mostly on its own human resources, made up of doctors, nurses, auxiliaries, and local people, who may be hired with pay, and works in partnership with governments only when necessary while making its own independent assessment of a given health situation. The finances of MSF have apparently been quite open to researchers, and the allocation of resources is a transparent process. The organization gets 89% of its budget from some five million private donors, 9% from public institutions, such as the European Community and members, and 2% from other sources. Records also show that MSF spends very little on administration, management, and general activities, which take only about 6-7% of the total budget expenditures. Only 2% of the proceedings are dedicated to fundraising. Over the decades, MSF has spent more funds in Africa than in any other continent, over 60% of its budget. In 2014, the amount spent in Africa rose to 65% or 46 million Euros out of its 1.28 billion Euro budget, an increase of 272 million Euros over 2013 (Medecins Sans Frontieres Financial Report 2014), when the overall budget was 1.2 billion Euros.",

The fortunate countries in Africa where MSF did its critical work in 2014-2015 on behalf of the sick, the poor, the refugees, and children in time of strife included Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Congo-DRC (since 1985), Egypt, Ethiopia (during the 1984-1985 famine, which led to its expulsion from the country for speaking out against the government), Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Cote d'Ivoire (since 1990 ), Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya (since 2011 ), Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda (in 1994 , Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan (especially during the outbreak of the kala azar or visceral leishmaniasis in 2010), Sudan, Swaziland, Uganda (since 1980), and Zimbabwe. The war in Liberia, for example, which started in 1989 until 1996 to resume again in 1999 until 2003, appears to have affected some 49% of the women by 1998, who were subjected to at least one act of physical or sexual violence by soldiers or combatants. A study of Rwandan women showed that, for many, rape became their first sexual act, and 95% of these violated women contracted HIV/AIDS, which multiplied the rate of the epidemic in the country; this, of course, occurs on top of robbery, torture of women and children, domestic physical and psychological violence, street incidents, and armed conflict, which often resulted in deaths and injury, poor nutrition, and exposure to infections and deadly diseases, and less access to health care and disease prevention and treatment (see Niang 2008: 11, 35) . It is amidst these inhuman occurrences that the MSF gets involved to save the innocent victims that have nowhere else to go to seek assistance, including medical treatment. Finally, it might be important to note that, even though MSF's work has continued to be vital and effective in the world, especially in Africa, the organization reluctantly accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999, three years after it had been a recipient of the Seoul Peace Prize. A major factor that has contributed to MSF's success wherever it has worked has been its emphasis on gathering accurate and vital statistics, which have made it one of the most statistically grounded organizations in the world.",

In 2008, Blair founded the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, whose aim was to foster interfaith understanding among the major religions, followed, in 2009, by the establishment of the Tony Blair Africa Governance initiative (AGI), headquartered in London, which is the subject of the next brief discussion. The top organizational structure consists of the Patron (Tony Blair), a Secretary, and a Chief Executive, who works closely with the Trustees. Evgeny Lebedev, a Blair trusted staff member who worked in West Africa-Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the Prime Minister had sent a British intervention force during the Sierra Leone's civil war in 2000-was appointed to ensure the smooth and effective functioning of AGI in the Ebola-afflicted region in early-and mid-2014. Lebedev characterized the purpose of AGI as one not intent on providing doctors or nurses but one that would focus \"on something often dismissed or not even considered in modern schools of crisis management: the daily task of governance.\"",

Drugs and medical staff were no use for AGI if they could not get where they were needed. What was required, said Lebedev, was \"command and control.\" Lebedev further wrote that AGI was \u2026specifically designed to help those governments build the capacity to deliver. That is what we did with Ebola. The situation was spiraling out of control and the governments were struggling. Then you had a vast influx of international help. But it needed to be channeled. That was the key, and out people played an absolutely crucial part in putting that together. (Lebedev 2014: 6) Thus, the most important mission of AGI was ensuring that data on the origins of the disease were collected and activities prioritized and properly planned, all of which would lead to effective delivery of whatever was required of the effort to eradicate Ebola. Proper handling and advising on logistics became the espoused philosophy that would result in efficiency and fair distribution of resources, such as the building and location of headquarters and centers to facilitate the reception of patients and dispensation of medications, drugs, and critical treatment to the affected West Africans, especially in Sierra Leone. Here, some 45 million British pounds were spent on health-related projects and 18 million British pounds on governance. It must be said that, no matter what its final verdict will be, AGI is thought to have contributed positively to the more effective running of the Ebola logistics operations, as happened at Freetown's Connaught Hospital. One other strong element of AGI was that the civil staff was drawn from the civil service and the city, and from what is called \"management consultancy.\" As a result, Tony Blair became a major humanitarian celebrity among most West Africans.",

It has prepared 190 briefings on the crisis and on the methods to provide more efficient assistance to the victims, helping Sierra Leonean and British army personnel to establish the first Ebola National Situation Room in the country, transporting the sick from one region of the country to another to optimize the resources and distribution centers-as was the case with the transfer of beds from areas that might have had too many to those where there were too few. Unfortunately, the alleged waste of resources and political influence were said to interfere with the ethical goals of AGI. Blair was accused of wasting many thousands of British pounds in such countries as Malawi and of supposedly exerting undue pressure on big donors who worked for the government to contribute to AGI. On the waste of resources, indeed some programs had to be cancelled in Malawi, the former British protectorate, at a cost of some 300,000 British pounds, following six months of planning and the critical work already done (See BBC News 2005).",

            "text": "In this context, CHAI has had an impact on the fight against diseases on the African continent. At its founding, in low-and middle-income countries, only 200,000 people were being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/ AIDS, and were paying as much as $10,000 per person per year for treatment. The number of people has, however, reached over 9.9 million worldwide now. CHAI seems to have tripled the number of patients being treated and has negotiated prices that convinced pharmaceuticals of the need to reduce them sometimes by as much as 80 to 90%. The Foundation has been operating in 38 partner countries, and 70 others have benefited from the negotiated price reductions on medical devices, diagnostics, and vaccines (The Clinton Health Access Initiative 2015). In Tanzania, where the first pilot project was introduced, CHAI, for example, has been able to reduce the price of artemisinin-based combination therapies against malaria, thus enabling the number of patients buying the therapies in private drug stores to increase from 1% to 44%, as is the case in Swaziland. In fact, as a result, Swaziland is the first country in Sub-Saharan Africa that might be \"on the verge of achieving\" the goal of eradicating malaria. We end our discussion by noting that the Clinton Foundation has been a target of considerable negative publicity leveled by journalists, politicians, and some philanthropic organizations for allegedly not being transparent or forthcoming with its budget, and the fact that it seems to be receiving donations from several questionable foreign sources due to suspected inappropriate influence exerted by Hillary Clinton while secretary of state in the 2009-2013 period and as a candidate for the presidency in 2008 and 2016. In the 2016 presidential campaign, the Foundation came under heavy scrutiny and criticism, which may have contributed to Hillary's stunning defeat by Donald Trump. Apparently, Chelsea Clinton, daughter of the Clintons, has brought some transparency to the charitable contributions, one of the reasons why the Foundation is now called the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, even though many still call it the Clinton Foundation. Unfortunately, it is difficult to ascertain precisely how much the Foundation has spent on and in Africa, though the 2013 report gives a figure of $52,058,000, which is a significant contribution to the health needs of the continent (The Clinton Foundation 2013).",

The human conditions just mentioned are applicable to most of the countries of the Sahel, whose cyclical famines kill thousands of children and poor people when they strike, and in Sub-Saharan Africa, and have a direct impact on people's health. FAO was founded in October 1945 in Quebec City, Canada, and is headquartered in Rome, Italy, after it was moved from Washington, D.C., but has offices around the globe. Its decisions are made by the biennial FAO Conference, which has representatives from each member nation and the European Union. The Conference elects a 49-member Council, which acts as its executive body. Members serve for three years on a rotating basis. FAO is headed by a Director-General who presides over a Board of Directors consisting of 12 members. As known, Africa is never properly prepared for natural disasters, even when scientific mapping and forecasts are announced, or when we know that they tend to occur every few years. Unfortunately, the media responds slowly and the international community, even though fast to assist, tends not to figure into the equation the health needs of the affected population and does not look for and treat the structural causes. If there is attention given to recurring phenomena, it is usually short-lived. It is important, therefore, that we comment briefly on the issue of famine as it relates to disease. As a result of the food shortages in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the Sahel, during the 1970s, FAO took on the role of contributing to world food security and helping small farmers to grow better crops in 1974 at the World Food Conference. This phase was followed by a focus also on sustainable agriculture in rural areas and technologically meeting the level of technological advance of the host country during the 1980s and 1990s (Mingst, Encyclopedia Britannica 2014) .",

Other issues that have received criticism include its secret practices and the absence of transparent guidelines, except to the treasurer, and the fact that its members are not permanent and function only under consensus. Its recommendations are not legally binding but have been always accepted by the parties involved. Participants in the Club include four representatives: Delegates from the debtor country; creditor countries; the IMF, as the advisory board; and international organizations, such as OECD, the World Bank, and regional development banks from Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, the Inter-American Development Banks, and the UNCTAD, participating only as observers. The Club commands billions of dollars for its purposes, the reason why it works so closely with the countries and organizations which, for various reasons, include health and negotiating loans for Africa. How exactly the Club impacts Africa's health can only be inferred, since only the funds that are included in the various debts from the IMF and the World Bank are a part of the operation of the health systems in Africa, especially Sub-Saharan Africa. How does this work? In their authoritative study of the Club in 2001, Juan Carlos and Mathew Martin (2001: 15) note that \"Having signed an Agreed Minute [signed agreement] with the Paris Club, the debtor country negotiates bilateral agreements with each Paris Club creditor government (and in some cases with separate agencies within that government).\" Though the Club sets deadlines for the conclusion of these agreements, usually around six months after the multilateral meeting, the process can be lengthy, often up to 18 months. us agency for inTernaTional deVeloPmenT (usaid), naTional insTiTuTes of healTh (nih), and cenTers for disease conTrol and PreVenTion (cdc) USAID, the NIH, and the CDC have not received much attention like the other international agencies and organizations in this volume. USAID, established in its present form by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, has been working in other forms in Africa since the 1950s and, using its multifocused purpose, it has done important work that has improved the health of the Africans on the continent. This work has ranged from funding studies on infant mortality and maternal health, to health and sanitation programs, malaria eradication campaigns, and HIV/AIDS containment and eradication, and to other social and political issues such as the improvement of women's opportunities for economic self-sufficiency, women's education, democratic governance and participation, and women's reproductive care. Through provision of grants on a competitive basis, the agency has benefited individuals, nations, organizations, and civil society in Africa and in the developing world, and has enabled the implementation of innovative ideas and unique development projects in 42 African countries totaling $4.5 billion in 2014. Its website lists its focus for Africa as the following: Boosting agricultural productivity through the feed the Future Initiative to fight \"chronic hunger and poverty; strengthening health systems through the Global Health Initiative; supporting democracy, human rights, and good governance thus fighting corruption, and expanding civil society, helping citizens choose their leadership; increasing resilience to climate shocks; and leading quick responses to humanitarian crises (US Agency for International Development: Africa 2015). Even though it has been one of the premier US agencies in Africa, USAID has encountered much criticism most recently. Critics have charged that the agency has attempted to impose US views and values on grant recipients, pointing as an example to the latest aggressive promotion of mass circumcisions in Africa and US involvement in the internal issue of homosexuality in Uganda. Others have impugned the agency for allegedly favoring certain applicants and organizations over their competitors, who receive grant cycle and focus information in advance, thus stifling competition to favor those that may have received several grants in the past, and that the agency does not care much for applications coming from minorities and minority institutions. One of the best outcomes of the agency's effort in Africa has been the periodic reports that it disseminates to interested parties and scholars, which are available free on the Internet.",

The two agencies are also seen in Africa as elitist, as they tend to work only with universities and large pharmaceuticals, while they seem to show little knowledge about Africa's health priority needs, in which they have shown little interest, just as the Ebola virus scare demonstrated. When they have involved themselves in issues of health on the continent, the NIH and the CDC have channeled their meager foreign funding to limited and specific projects. The CDC's fiasco regarding preparedness to stamp out the spread of the Ebola virus in Africa and the US did not help the image of the agency in Africa and the world. Mishandling of the situation resulted in two deaths in US hospitals in Texas and Nebraska, as well as the infection of several nurses, which served only to discredit the agency and its Director, Thomas Frieden, who many experts and observers thought he should have been immediately fired for incompetence and negligence.",

The confusing, unclear, vague, and piecemeal guidelines and protocols promulgated much later to physicians and nurses on the isolation and quarantine of infected individuals and the protection of the health workers created a situation that the governors of New York and New Jersey took matters into their own hands and passed their own quarantine ordinances. These were applied by Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey to a nurse who had just returned from Liberia, only to be rebuffed by a court order. The NIH's work in Africa is even more obscure, even though the agency has participated in research and in some projects that not many Africans can point to, except perhaps the now failed HIV/AIDS clinical trials in East and Southern Africa as alluded to earlier.",

To briefly point to its successes since its inception in the 1940s: The WorldPress (2014) notes, for example, that in 1967, some 31 countries in the world had endemic outbreaks of smallpox that affected between 10 million and 15 million people, killing some 2 million, blinding, and disfiguring thousands. As the WHO put together all its resources to eradicate the disease through preventive measures and vaccines, the last successful case recorded occurred 10 years later in Somalia on October 26, 1977. Ironically, \"the eradication of smallpox was initially rejected by member states as being too difficult and too complex,\" but it proved to be \"one of WHO's greatest achievements\" (Clift 2013: 23) . The fierce and difficult battle against polio, partly due to cultural misunderstandings, had only a dozen of cases remaining in such countries as Northern Nigeria, India, and Pakistan by the end of 2014.",

Since then, it has virtually disappeared from the globe even among the world's 49 most affected countries. The WHO and its international partners' battle, which began in 1974 against the black fly that causes river blindness, was known to affect some 10 million people annually, killing so many of its victims, especially in parts of West and Central Africa, while displacing millions of others, has now been tamed. Consequently, more than 40 million people have been able to return to their original homes in such countries as Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Mali. The same story applies to leprosy, for centuries the most abominable disease in Africa. It has been eradicated in several developing countries, especially in Africa, and fewer than 10 million people in the region see it now as a health threat. Currently, the sting of the six most deadly children's diseases, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, and rotavirus, pneumococcus, and HIB vaccinated diseases-meningitis, sepsis, septic arthritis, periorbital cellulitis-which killed some 540,000 people a year worldwide by 1990, and poliomyelitis, have been reduced through immunizations and preventive educational strategies, hygiene and sanitation. Infant mortality, one of the first targets of the WHO and its affiliate, UNESCO, following the Alma-Ata Conference which declared 2000 to be the year when health care would be accessible to all as a human right, affected eight out of 10 children. It had been reduced from 134 per 1000 in 1970 to 80 per 1000 by 1995. Since then, the rate has declined by 37% and has continued to decline in most parts of the world (WorldPress 2014: 2).",

The past 10 years have witnessed a proliferation of what are commonly called global health initiatives (GHIs), and PEPFAR is a most important one among them, which has competed effectively with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. These initiatives were implemented as emergency responses for the scale-up of control of the major communicable diseases, especially HIV/AIDS. GHIs are characterized by their ability to mobilize huge levels of financial resources, linking input to performance; and, when possible, by channeling resources directly to civil society and NGOs. Three GHIs-the World Bank's Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program, GFATM, and PEPFAR-have contributed more than two-thirds of all direct external funding to scaling up HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care in resource-poor countries such as Tanzania (Biesma et al. 2009 ). Increasing access to health initiatives, doubling the employment of skilled health care providers, educating the community, addressing safety issues, improving water and sanitation, and discussing universal precautions at the workplace for nurses and physicians are ways of increasing involvement and efficacy of the health care system and optimizing public health outcomes. Indeed, HIV/AIDS is a lifelong illness and affects women, men, and children and all nationalities, no matter the socioeconomic status.",

The other problem has been the justified concern that the US wishes to impose its rule when it caps its contribution to 33% of the total contributions made by the donors. A further issue has been associated with the fact that some countries at times have been unable to disburse the funds as promised and have asked for extensions. These are not allowed any longer, as happened with Kenya and Uganda. In such cases, funds will be reclaimed.

UNAIDS does not claim a victory of its own, given its meager annual budget provided by the WHO and philanthropic organizations, but it is entitled to share on the success. It has provided global leadership in the fight against HIV/ AIDS, informed and urged member states to apply the best practices in the field of HIV/AIDS advances, has served as the most powerful advocate of those living with HIV/AIDS since 1996, and is the appropriate coordinating body for the eradication of the disease.

Beyond helping governments to provide nutritious food to their people, especially children, women, and vulnerable citizens through advice, special projects, and financial assistance, the agency has worked diligently with the relevant ministries of member states to adopt policies that promote good nutritional habits that will necessarily contribute to public health. FAO consists of seven departments that assist Africa: Administration and Finance, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Economic and Social Development, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Forestry, Natural Resource Management and Environment, and Technical Cooperation. FAO's budget for the biennial fiscal year (2012-2013) was just over $1 billion. The funds come from voluntary contributions by member states and organizations. To the extent that FAO stresses proper nutrition, this UN agency contributes to health and public health in Africa, the reason why it is relevant and crucial. On its part, the Novo Nordisk World Diabetes Foundation, despite its small size in funds and personnel, is a most relevant foundation for Africa, given that diabetes, a chronic disease, is currently affecting millions of Africans. Not only does it contribute to the treatment many Africans would not have but it has raised awareness of the diabetes epidemic on the continent, which no other organization has done so far. In sum, no one in his or her right mind can dismiss the work that the unselfish and impeccably ethical MSF has done in Africa and other parts of the world whenever there has suffering from civil strife and war or natural disaster, such was the case the Ebola crisis in parts of West Africa where the organization deployed a staff of some 2,000 paid and unpaid, national and international volunteers. Virtually in every country that has experienced civil war such as in Angola, Mozambique, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, this humanitarian organization has been present. During the Ebola crisis, MSF lost some of its most dedicated physicians, nurses, and others that were involved in their mission to save lives, while overseeing the affected Africans and treating some 2,760 saving the lives of affected Africans and over half of them.",

One of its most significant contributions in this recent crisis has been the collection, analysis, and provision of data, as well as making available critical health information through consistent and substantive briefings. These helped the government authorities and the rescue operators to identify the sources of the disease and the most effective approaches to manage resources and help the sick and those who were still at risk during the crisis. The AGI helped to highlight the risks of Ebola and find ways to contain its ravages.",

It has tirelessly contributed to the dispensation of vaccines, while urging and participating in immunization campaigns, especially for children, against TB, malaria, and HIV/ AIDS, and providing antiretroviral treatment, while successfully pressuring pharmaceuticals to lower their drug prices on behalf of the poor, the disabled, the sick, and those who cannot afford to purchase life-saving medications. Thus, the international organizations, such as the Clinton Initiative, both individually and collectively have been critical in the struggle to protect the health of the Africans and improve their health systems during the crises as well as under normal conditions. The humanitarian organizations in Africa have so far poured billions of dollars annually, in the hopes of raising simultaneously the consciousness of our, at times, seemingly insensitive, uninterested, incapable, and oblivious leaders in the face of the health catastrophes plaguing their own people, while spending the least of the vast resources in the struggle to stamp out even those epidemics easiest to contain or eradicate, as is the case with several children's diseases including measles and whooping cough.",

This may be done mainly through active and focused training of the locals. Above all, however, stands the absolute need for all humanitarian organizations to demand more accountability on the part of the African political leaders and those who manage the health ministries which have often become institutions simply looking for information and dispensing treatment rather than preventing disease. Indeed, they deserve the epitaph of Ministries of Disease, as some scholars have suggested. Yet, notwithstanding all their shortcomings, international humanitarian organizations have been and will continue to be vital as long as Africans, for one reason or another, are unable to meet on their own the overwhelming health needs they face daily.",

However, this author joins others who agree that the Paris Club has been as disappointing as the IMF and the World Bank with which it works closely. To say the least, it has been a strange and cumbersome organization that has no funds of its own but works in tandem with the two gigantic financial institutions, the debtors, and the creditor countries. Lack of transparency has continued to be a major criticism of this organization. The publication of its by-laws perhaps is the harbinger of better policies to come. Generally, the issue of corruption and international assistance has had many detractors and defenders. This is the time and place for the author to make a few comments about what is being proposed in the face of the failures that the African continent has experienced since independence. Regarding over-reliance on foreign aid for health and other needs in Africa, some anti-neocolonialists and dependency theorists have suggested that Africa simply stop paying the debt to the institutions they have borrowed the money from and refuse to accept any assistance be it in loans or grants-the reason being that, since Africa started accepting or asking for foreign aid, the level of poverty has continued to rise, economic development has stagnated, and suffering has not abated. Zambian Dambisa Moyo, who once worked for Goldman Sachs and as a consultant for the World Bank, writes in her Dead Aid: Why Aid is not Working and How There is a Better Way for Africa, that Africa has been trapped in and has become too dependent on the outside world's assistance, namely, the Western World, and that things will never improve unless the stream of assistance is stopped. She sarcastically writes: \"The four horses of Africa's apocalypse-corruption, disease, poverty and war-can easily ride across international borders, putting Westerners at just as much risk as Africans. Of course, stolen money sent to European bank accounts can fund terrorist activities; disease, poverty and war induce waves of disfranchisement of refugees and unchecked immigration, which can place inordinate burdens on Western economies\" (Moyo 2009: 151) .",

First of all, killing the four apocalyptic horses, if possible, might definitely end the misery, but these are iron horses that cannot be easily killed and there is no guarantee that other horses, such as ethnic rivalry, nepotism, non-Western-induced corruption, and infectious and chronic diseases that defy all logic would not emerge. Were Africans to simply refuse all aid, refuse to pay back any portion of the loans and relinquish even grants, the whole health system would collapse, because the trillions of dollars poured into the continent annually would leave a deep crater with not enough dirt to fill it and restore the landscape. With assistance from abroad, both disease and poverty have, in fact, decreased in some corners of the continent. The problem is that they have not decreased as fast as on other continents. Smallpox, yaws, and polio have been eradicated from the continent. The prevalence of leprosy, river blindness and trypanosomiasis is at the tipping point where there is the probability that we can eradicate them during the next two decades. Maternal and infant mortality rates have relatively gone down. This would not have happened without the assistance received from the developing countries, no matter how one feels about the former colonizers. In fact, many Westerners unconsciously see assistance as veiled reparations for the resources they took from Africa to develop their own economies and reduce their own rate of poverty and disease. Africans do not receive the aid at gun point from the West-they are the ones who ask and even bag for it through negotiations.",

The reasons are many. Africa has the least hospitable climate, the most difficult topography, and the least portion of arable land (6%) of all the major continents of the world. Corruption in Africa does not come just from foreign assistance: It is ingrained in the upbringing of many leaders. Thus, if the aid were to be removed tomorrow, corruption would not end. In addition, technology is still slowly trickling down to Africa. Who is responsible for the situation? Rather than advocating radical, unrealistic solutions, it is best to examine how foreign assistance is dispensed to Africans. First of all, the negotiators of the terms are the same people who siphon the funds for themselves, their families, and their cronies and are directly involved in the evaluation and assessment of the outcomes. Impartial and honest brokers, such as intellectuals and the people for which the assistance is targeted, are never present in the halls of the presidential or ministerial offices. Second, accountability is lax, as the donors do not critically and carefully scrutinize how the funds are spent, who benefits, and whether the outcomes are those intended in the first place.",

It would also make sense if most of the aid went to the neediest countries in the developing world. Any country that moves up to the rank of a high income developing country ought to be given proportional assistance and thus compel it to live within its means, develop its natural resources, diversify its farming and mineral activities, and invest in the citizens' future, an element of development that receives little attention in Africa from both the leaders and the people who have the means to put aside some of their personal wealth. Consequently, what is needed is transparency at the negotiations and during implementation of any project and assessment of how funds are used; clear targets of the funds appropriated; funneling of most assistance to social programs (education and health) and infrastructure building; developing and transferring technologies, which Africans should insist during negotiations of the projects; provision of funds for projects where the recipients must prove their sustainability; insistence on democratic governance where civil society can actually be a witness to the honest use of funds; and, on the part of the givers, ensuring that Africans are not treated as ignorami, who do not know the needs of their continent. Donors are admonished to stop the imposed vertical approach to issues that are vital to Africa's well-being and to their common good based on the principle that, even though appropriate to one part of the world, imposed solutions may not be culturally or environmentally applicable.",

Protecting national security and interest is the principle that all nations follow, and it is regrettable that, quite often, African leaders seem to forget this simply common sense international relations goal. Finally, Epidemiology 101 and Demography 101 warn all nations that, if the population goes unchecked, it will continue to choke any attempts at development, education, and adequate provision of health care. Africa is the only continent that is demographically growing carelessly in a world where resources are finite. Finally, posing the question: \"Why Aid is not Working\" in Africa is tantamount to a tautology, as one has already conditioned the reader to believe that it is not working. Overall, Africa's aid is not \"dead aid\": it is working, even though it could work much better if the necessary checks and balances were always present. Two African experts, Yaya & Ileka-Priouzeau, make the exactly opposite point, namely, that Africa needs international assistance to achieve its health goals and that an apportionment of about 7% of the GDP of the industrialized world would go a long way in helping the developing world achieve the MDGs.",

(World Bank 1994: 219) In conclusion, as the WHO says, among other goals, \"There is an urgent need to establish accountable and transparent systems to monitor and evaluate health expenditures as health spending from public and private sources increases. Getting this right is one of Africa's big public health challenges\" (African Region Health Report 2013: 125).

But after one decade it is clear that the current situation is not conducive to building strong national health research systems in Africa. Consequently, the promise of strengthening the health care systems may remain elusive, despite the positive efforts. African countries are not acting to their declarations, and are reneging on their commitment to take the lead by increasing their investments in health and research for health. Although international support for health has increased substantially in recent years, there has been a continued focus on disease-specific initiatives. Much donor support funneled through international organizations, and country support continues to flow mainly to non-governmental organizations. The guidance of the Paris Declaration and the Accra Plan of Action are being royally ignored with more than two-thirds of donor assistance for health bypassing government. (Mbacke 2013: S15) One other important prerequisite in Africa's fight against disease, which has usually been ignored, is \"inter-nation\" collaboration, given that the frontiers do not protect anyone from cross-border infectious diseases and epidemics. Disappointingly, as the UN says, each African country has its own approaches to \"developing national health policy,\" and that \"only a few [e.g., Burundi, CAR, Mauritania, Gabon, and Tanzania], have recently developed or reviewed these policies with WHO support to make their health-care services stronger, more efficient and more widely available\" (African Region Health Report 2013: 109). In sum, developing national health policies across regions has yet to be done as a \"key step towards taking a sector-wide approach\" that will contribute in its own way to the survival of our planet, Africa, and its people.",
