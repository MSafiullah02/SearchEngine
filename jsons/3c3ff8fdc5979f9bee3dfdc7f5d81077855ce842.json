To address these unmet healthcare needs, especially for the early prediction and treatment of major diseases, health informatics, which deals with the acquisition, transmission, processing, storage, retrieval, and use of health information, has emerged as an active area of interdisciplinary research. In particular, acquisition of health-related information by unobtrusive sensing and wearable technologies is considered as a cornerstone in health informatics. Sensors can be weaved or integrated into clothing, accessories, and the living environment, such that health information can be acquired seamlessly and pervasively in daily living. Sensors can even be designed as stick-on electronic tattoos or directly printed onto human skin to enable long-term health monitoring. This paper aims to provide an overview of four emerging unobtrusive and wearable technologies, which are essential to the realization of pervasive health information acquisition, including: 1) unobtrusive sensing methods, 2) smart textile technology, 3) flexible-stretchable-printable electronics, and 4) sensor fusion, and then to identify some future directions of research.",

Looking back in history, it is not surprised to notice that innovation in this area is closely coupled with the advancements in electronics. Using electrocardiogram (ECG) device as an example, Fig. 1 illustrates the evolution of sensing technologies, where the core technologies of these devices have evolved from water buckets and bulky vacuum tubes, bench-top, and portable devices with discrete transistors, to the recent clothing and small gadgets based wearable devices with integrated circuits [3] . In the future, it may evolve into flexible and stretchable wearable devices with carbon nanotube (CNT)/graphene/organic electronics [4] .

First, with their wireless connectivity together with the widely available internet infrastructure, the devices can provide real-time information and facilitate timely remote intervention to acute events such as stroke, epilepsy and heart attack, particularly in rural or otherwise underserved areas where expert treatment may be unavailable. In addition, for healthy population, unobtrusive and wearable monitoring can provide detailed information regarding their health and fitness, e.g., via mobile phone or flexible displays, such that they can closely track their wellbeing, which will not only promote active and healthy lifestyle, but also allow The objectives of this paper are to provide an overview of unobtrusive sensing and wearable systems with particular focus on emerging technologies, and also to identify the major challenges related to this area of research. The rest of this paper is organised as follows: Section II will discuss unobtrusive sensing methods and systems. Section III will present the recent advances and core technologies of wearable devices and will also highlight the latest developments in smart textile technology and flexible-stretchable electronics. Section IV will discuss data fusion methods for sensing informatics as well as the impacts of big data in healthcare.

The most commonly measured vital signs include: ECG, ballistocardiogram (BCG), heart rate, blood pressure (BP), blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), core/surface body temperature, posture, and physical activities. A conceptual model of unobtrusive physiological monitoring in a home setting is shown in Fig. 2 [5] . Unobtrusive sensing can be implemented in two ways: 1) sensors are worn by the subject, e.g., in the form of shoes, eyeglasses, ear-ring, clothing, gloves and watch, or 2) sensors are embedded into the ambient environment or as smart objects interacting with the subjects, e.g., a chair [6] , [7] , car seat [8] , mattress [9] , mirror [10] , steering wheel [11] , mouse [12] , toilet seat [13] , and bathroom scale [14] . Fig. 3 shows some prototypes of the unobtrusive sensing systems developed by different research groups. Information can be collected by a smartphone and transmitted wirelessly to a remote center for storage and analysis. In the following section, we will discuss some unobtrusive sensing methods for the acquisition of vital signs.",

            "text": "Capacitance-coupled sensing method is commonly used for measuring biopotentials such as ECG, electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) [7] , [15] . For this method, the skin and the electrode form the two layers of a capacitor. Without direct contact with the body, some issues, such as skin infection and signal deterioration, brought about by adhesive electrodes in long term monitoring can be avoided. Some typical implementations of capacitive ECG sensing are summarized in Table I . In addition, capacitive sensing can also be used for other applications such as respiratory measurement, e.g., using a capacitive textile force sensor weaved into clothing [16] , or a capacitive electrical field sensor array placed under a sleeping mattress [17] . The major challenges in designing these noncontact electrodes lie in the high contact impedance due to the indirect contact and the capacitive mismatch caused by motion artifacts [15] . It may cause low signal to noise ratio and thus lead to challenges in the frontend analog circuit design.

The signal measured by this method represents the pulsatile blood volume changes of peripheral microvasculature induced by pressure pulse within each cardiac cycle. Traditionally, the sensing unit is in direct contact with skin. Recent research has shown that sensors can be integrated into daily living accessories or gadgets like ear-ring, glove and hat, to achieve unobtrusive measurement. Various Table II. Recently, Jae et al. [25] proposed an indirect-contact sensor for PPG measurement over clothing. A control circuit was adopted to adaptively adjust the light intensity for various types of clothings. On the other hand, Poh et al. [26] showed that heart rate and respiration rate can be derived from PPG that was remotely captured from a subject's face using a simple digital camera. However, the temporal resolution of the blood volume detected by this method is restricted by the sample rate of the camera (up to 30 frames per second), thus affecting its accuracy.",

Conventional methods such as auscultatory, oscillometric, and volume clamp are not suitable for unobtrusive BP measurement. Pulse wave propagation method is a promising technique for unobtrusive BP measurement. It is based on the relationship between pulse wave velocity (PWV) and arterial pressure according to Moens-Korteweg equation. Pulse transit time (PTT), the reciprocal of PWV can be readily derived from PPG and ECG in an unobtrusive way. Various linear and nonlinear models that expressed BP in terms of PTT have been developed for cuffless BP estimation. The subject-dependent parameters in BP-PTT model should be determined first when using this approach for BP estimation. A very simple way to implement individual calibration is to use the hydrostatic pressure approach, where the subjects are required to elevate their hands to specific heights above/below the heart level [40] . A theoretical relationship between PTT, BP, and height can be written in (1) , as shown at the bottom of the page, where b is the subjectdependent parameter characterizing the artery properties, L is the distance traveled by the pulse, P h is the hydrostatic pressure \u03c1gh, and P i is the internal pressure. Using the proposed model, the individualized parameters in BP-PTT model can be determined from some simple movements. This model-based cuffless BP measurement method can be implemented in a variety of platforms for unobtrusive monitoring, such as the bed cushion and chair, as shown in Fig. 3 .",

Another example is the wireless capsule device that can be pinned on the esophageal to measure pH level over a 48-hour period for better diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease [62] . However, the sensor is difficult to be securely attached for the complete sensing periods in some subjects, and premature losing of the capsule has been reported quite often. Other technologies such as the development of mucosal adhesive patches could be a potential solution in this regard. Another important application for mucosal adhesive patches is to design them as drug delivery systems. By placing these devices inside the gastrointestinal tract and with feedback mechanisms installed, the release of drug can be better controlled. This is anticipated to be helpful to the better management of many chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension.",

For instance, Brigante et al. recently developed a highly compact and lightweight wearable system for motion caption by careful selection of IMUs and optimized layout design [64] . A highly integrated microsystem was designed for cardiac electrical and mechanical activity monitoring, which assembled the multisensor module, signal processing electronics, and powering unit into a single platform with a flexible substrate [65] . In addition to the integrated design and compact packaging, the development of new measuring principle is another way to achieve miniaturization. The aforementioned PTT-based cuffless BP measuring method is a promising substitute for the widely used cuff-based methods in this regard. Further miniaturization can be achieved by using other technologies such as inductive powering where the sensor can be powered partly or completely by RF powering, and the battery can be removed [66] .",

BSN can be wired (e.g., interconnect with smart fabric) or wireless (making use of common wireless sensor networks and standards, e.g., BAN, WPAN (IEEE 802.15.6), Bluetooth/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE or Bluetooth Smart), and ZigBee).

The most critical issue in WPAN/WLAN technologies is to guarantee the quality of service (QoS), which contains latency, transmission power, reliability (i.e., error control) and bandwidth reservation. While for healthcare applications, these issues become more challenging because all the specifications should be satisfied simultaneously. For example, monitoring ECG requires a data rate of tens to hundreds of kilobit/s, end-to-end delay within 2 s and bit error rate of below 10 \u22124 [70] . Under some life-critical situations, the compromise between reliability and latency constraint of data transmission is even more prominent. Effective error control schemes have been proposed to address this issue, such as the combined use of feed-forward error control (FEC) and block interleaving in data-link layer [71] . For bandwidth demanding applications, such as two-dimensional (2-D) mode of echocardiograph and ultrasound video transmission, to transmit the data with minimal loss of diagnostic information and in real time, the protocol should be designed to optimize the transmission rate, minimize the latency and maximize the reliability. Various enhanced protocols on rate control have been proposed for these applications, such as a hybrid solution either using retransmission or retransmission combined with FEC techniques depending on the channel conditions [72] , adapting the sending rate of source encoder according to the mobile link throughput [73] .",

            "text": "Security is a critical issue of networking, especially for medical applications. Without adequate security, the transmitted information is vulnerable to potential threats, such as eavesdropping, tampering, denial of service, which are caused by unauthorized access. The challenging issues to guarantee security lie in three aspects: how to prevent the disclosure of patient's data, who have the right to access the system, and how to protect the privacy of the user [74] . Securing the data transmission between wearable sensors should be the first step. To secure inter-sensor communications, the most important issue is to design a key agreement for encryption. Identity-based symmetric cryptography and asymmetric key cryptography based on elliptic curve have been adopted for BSN [75] , [76] . Another novel method is based on biometrics traits. Since the human body contains its own transmission system such as blood circulation system, it is believed that the information from the system itself can be used to secure the information communication between sensors. Meanwhile, since wearable sensors are already there to capture physiological signals, it is convenient to implement encryption schemes using physiological signals in the key agreement. Poon et al. firstly proposed to use the interpulse intervals (IPIs) as the biometric traits to encrypt the symmetric key, as shown in Fig. 5 [77] . The results showed that a minimum half total error rate of 2.58% was achieved when the signals were sampled at 1000 Hz and then coded into 128-bit binary sequences. Subsequently, other similar approaches have been proposed [78] . For example, Venkatasubramanian et al. proposed using frequency domain features of PPG as the basis of key agreement [79] . Furthermore, the complexity of the security scheme should also be considered due to the constraints on the energy budget and computational power of the wearable sensor. Various potential solutions have been developed, such as the data confidential and user authentication schemes with low complexity realized by minimizing the shared keys [80] , and mutual authentication and access control scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography with the advantage of energy-efficient [81] .",

            "text": "3) Energy-Efficiency and Digitalization: Energy-efficiency is a crucial element of a wearable device that directly affects the design and usability of the device, especially for long-term monitoring applications. There are mainly three strategies to achieve energy-efficient design. The first one is to improve the energy efficiency of the existing energy storage technologies, lithiumion batteries and supercapacitors. Liu et al. designed a novel structure of ZnCo 2 O 4 -urchins-on-carbon-fibers matrix to fabricate energy storage device that exhibits a reversible lithium storage capacity of 1180 mAh/g even after 100 cycles [82] . Fu et al. first adopted commercial pen ink as an active material for supercapacitors. With simple fabrication, the flexible fiber supercapacitors can achieve areal capacitance of 11.9-19.5 mF cm \u22122 and power density of up to 9.07 mW cm \u22122 [83] . The second is energy-aware design of wearable system. For example, a high-sensitivity near-infrared photo-transistor was recently developed based on an organic bulk heterojunction as shown in Fig. 6 (a) [84] . The results showed that the responsivity of this device can achieve 10 5 A W \u22121 . It has been successfully used for PPG measurement as shown in Fig. 6 (b) [84] . With the high responsivity, this device allows the use of a low-power light source, and thus reducing the power consumption of the sensor. Power management approaches, such as dynamic voltage scaling, battery energy optimal techniques and system energy management techniques have also been proposed [85] . Last but not the least is to scavenge energy from the environment or human activities, such as the lower-limb motion and vibration, body heat and respiration, which have great potential to become sustainable power sources for wearable sensors. The MIT Media Lab [86] has realized an unobtrusive device that scavenged energy from heel-strike of the user with shoe-mounted piezoelectric transducer. Recently, Leonov [87] has developed a hidden thermoelectric energy harvester of human body heat. It was integrated into clothing as a reliable powering source. For implantable devices, the preferred power solution is wireless powering. Kim et al. have derived the theoretical bound of wireless energy transmit efficiency through tissue. By optimizing the source density, the peak efficiency can achieve 4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at around 2.6 GHz, which is 4 times larger than that of the conventional near-field coil-based designs [88] .",

For example, the sampling rate for ECG should be no less than 125 Hz; otherwise, it will affect the accuracy of measurements [89] . Recently, novel nonuniformly sampling methods have been investigated to compress the representation of ECG signal in which the relevant information is localized in small intervals. One example is the integrate-and-fire sampler that integrates the input signal against an averaging function and the result is compared to a positive or negative threshold as shown in (2),",

However, the tradeoff is that exact reconstruction of the original signal is impossible [90] . Nonetheless, some critical information for accurate diagnosis can be preserved. Without reconstruction, a time-based integrate and fire encoding scheme can achieve 93.6% classification rate between normal heartbeats and arrhythmias, which is comparable to other methods [91] .",

However, the process of standardization is often very complicated and time consuming, especially in standardizing healthcare devices. Health information can be very different ranging from physiological (ECG, body temperature, oxygen saturation, etc.) to physical (posture, activity, etc.). Manufacturers tend to define their own proprietary formats and communication protocols. Interoperability therefore becomes a major obstacle in integrating devices into healthcare systems. To resolve this issue, standard protocols such as the HL7 reference information model have been proposed for the integration of different sensing modalities. For instance, Loh and Lee proposed the use of an Oracle Healthcare Transaction Base (HTB) system as the platform for integrating different information into a healthcare system [92] . ISO/IEEE 11073 (X73), initially intended for the implementation of Point-of-Care devices, is now extended to Personal Health Devices (PHD) to address the interoperability problem. This standard provides the communication functionality for a variety of wearable devices (i.e., pulse oximeter, heart rate monitor, BP monitor, thermometer, etc.) and standardizes the format of information for plug-and-play interoperability [93] . A recent study has validated the feasibility to apply this standard to wearable and wireless systems in home settings [94] . To meet the needs of some scenarios with limited processing abilities, some amendments have been made based on this standard, such as the adapted data model proposed in [95] and a new method to implement X73PHD in a microcontroller-based platform with low-voltage and low-power constraints [96] .",

At this point, textile technology provides feasible solutions to the unobtrusive measurement of these new parameters. For instance, a textile-based sweat rate sensor has recently been developed, which measures the water-vapor pressure gradient by two humidity sensors at different distances from skin [102] . Textile-based pH sensor was also proposed using a colormetric approach with pH sensitive dyes and optoelectronics [102] . In addition, Poh et al. developed conductive fabric electrodes for unobtrusive measurement of electrodermal activity (EDA), which can be used for long-term assessment of autonomic nerve activities during daily activities [103] . This textile sensor has been designed into a wrist-worn device that can provide ambulatory monitoring of autonomic parameters for patients with refractory epilepsy. The strong correlation between EDA amplitude and postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) duration, an autonomic biomarker of seizure intensity, indicates that EDA can be used as a surrogate measurement of PGES for ambulatory monitoring of epilepsy and thus provides opportunity for the identification of sudden death in epilepsy [104] .",

For example, Bao's team developed a high-sensitivity flexible capacitive pressure sensor with polydimethylsiloxane as the dielectric layer [111] . By microstructuring the dielectric layer and integrating it in a thin-film polymer transistor, it is able to achieve very high sensitivity when driving the flexible pressure-sensitive transistor in the subthreshold regime. This device has been applied to measure a human radial artery pulse wave with high-fidelity as shown in Fig. 8(b) [112] . Other examples include the e-skin with pressure and thermal sensors, and the flexible strain-gauge sensor for breathing monitoring as shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d) [58] , [113] . Some recent studies have proposed the fabrication of flexible photo-transistor [114] , which can be used to build PPG sensors. These advances will effectively pave the way for unobtrusive physiological measurements in the future. In addition to the applications in physiological and physical monitoring, flexible electronic technology also begins to play a key role in biochemical sensing. A flexible \"nano-electronic nose\" was developed by Michael et al. by transferring hundreds of prealigned silicon nanowires onto plastic substrate. It would open up new opportunities for wearable or implantable chemical and biological sensing [115] . Another example is the electrochemical tattoo biosensor recently developed by the research team from University of California San Diego, as shown in Fig. 8 (e) [116] . It can be easily worn on body for lactate monitoring during aerobic exercise. The performance of this tattoo sensor was evaluated in terms of its selectivity for lactate measurement, the ability of adhering to epidermal surface, and the robustness when exposed to mechanical stretching and bending. The results have showed its potential for unobtrusive and continuous monitoring of lactate during exercise [116] .",

Lee's team fabricated a flexible organic light emitting diode with modified graphene anode to achieve extremely high efficiency [120] . Xu et al. developed an organic bulk heterojunction based near-infrared photo-transistor [84] , which can be modified to a flexible device in the future. This device showed great potential for the design of low power PPG sensor due to its ultrahigh responsivity. Pang et al. developed a flexible and highly sensitive strain-gauge sensor that is based on two interlocked arrays of high-aspect-ratio Pt-coated polymeric nanofibres [121] . This device is featured by its simple fabrication process as well as the ability of measuring different types of mechanical forces with high sensitivity and wide dynamic range. The assembled device has been used to measure the physical force of heart beat by attaching it directly above the artery of the wrist under normal and exercise conditions.",

Stretchability, which enables the devices bend to extremely small radius and accommodate much higher strain while maintaining the electronic performance, is a more challenging characteristic and renders wider application possibilities. Some stretchable systems for health monitoring applications have been proposed. One example is the epidermal electronic system developed by Rogers' research group for measuring electrophysiological signals (ECG and EMG), temperature, and strain, as shown in Fig. 8(a) . The system consists of multifunctional sensors, processing unit, wireless transmission and powering, which are all mounted on an elastic polymer backing layer. The polymer sheet can be dissolved away, leaving only the circuits adhere to the skin via van der forces [4] . One problem of this device is that it can easily fall off during bathing or exercise. Therefore, they recently developed a new epidermal electronic system that has a total thickness of 0.8 m and can be directly printed onto the skin without the polymer backing. A commercially available spray-on bandage is then adopted as adhesives and encapsulants [110] . Other stretchable systems for biomedical applications have also been reported, such as the CNT-based strain sensor for human motion monitoring [58] , electronic skin [113] , and other as reviewed in [126] .",

Rogers and coworkers [127] configured the structures into wavy shapes supported by elastomeric substrate. The structure can accommodate up to 20%-30% compressive and tensile strain by changing the wave amplitudes and wavelengths. This buckling approach has also been adopted to fabricate graphene ribbons on stretchable elastomers [128] . Rogers and coworkers also proposed a noncoplanar mesh design with active device islands connected by thin polymer bridges on elastomeric substrates to achieve 140% level of strain [129] . Recently, White et al. [130] demonstrated an ultrathin, flexible and stretchable polymer-based light emitting diode (PLED), which can be fabricated with very simple processing method. By pressed onto a prestrained elastomer, the ultrathin PLED formed a random network of folds when releasing the strain on the elastomer. The experiment showed that the ultrathin PLED can be stretched up to 100% tensile strain. Meng et al. [131] designed and fabricated the assembled fiber supercapacitors composed of two intertwined graphene electrodes that showed highly compressible (strain of 50%) and stretchable (strain of 200%) properties, and can be easily woven into textile for wearable applications. New materials can also provide stretchability for electronics. Someya's group fabricated a composite film by uniformly dispersing single-walled CNTs in polymer matrices [132] . Other stretchable electronics based on nanocomposites such as gold nanoparticle-polyurethane composite as conductor [133] , graphene oxide nanosheet-conducting polymer as electrode [134] have also been proposed recently. These nanocomposites achieved both good electronic performance and mechanical robustness. These recent advancements in stretchable electronics will facilitate the adoption of these technologies in healthcare applications.",

Due to heterogeneous nature of the data that need to be combined, different data fusion algorithms have been designed for different applications. These algorithms can utilize different techniques from a wide range of areas, including artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, statistical estimation, and other areas. Health informatics has naturally benefited from these abundant literature. For instance, these fusion algorithms can be categorized into the following groups: 1) Statistical approach: weighted combination, multivariate statistical analysis and its most state-of-the-art data mining algorithm [142] . Among all the statistical algorithms, the arithmetic mean approach is considered as the simplest implementation for data fusion. However, the statistical approach might not be suitable when the data is not exchangeable or when estimators/classifiers have dissimilar performances [143] . 2) Probabilistic approach: Maximum likelihood methods and Kalman filter [144] , probability theory [145] , evidential reasoning and more specifically evidence theory are widely used for multisensor data fusion. Kalman filter is considered as the most popular probabilistic fusion algorithm because of its simplicity, ease of implementation, and optimality in a mean-squared error sense. However, Kalman filter is inappropriate for applications whose error characteristics are not readily parameterized. 3) Artificial intelligence: artificial cognition including genetic algorithms and neural networks. In many applications, the later approach serves both as a tool to derive classifiers or estimators and as a fusion framework of classifiers/estimators [142] , [143] . Fusion of sensing data with other health data: It is of vital importance to integrate sensing data with other health data, including genetic, medication, laboratory test, imaging data and narrative reports that provide context information for clinical diagnosis. Electronic health record (EHR) reposits these health data in a computer-readable form, which can be used for clinical decision support [146] . The heterogeneous contents and huge size of EHR bring great challenges for the fusion of these data. Bayesian network, neural networks, association rules, pattern recognition and logistic regression have been used to extract knowledge from EHR for patient stratification and predictive purposes in the past years. These methods offer significant advantages to traditional statistical methods because they are able to identify more complex relationships among variables. A comparison has been made among the three different classification methods in terms of their performance in predicting coronary artery disease [147] . It was found that the multilayer perceptron based neural network method showed the best performance in prediction [147] .",

Unlike these completely data-driven approaches, fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) is a logical-rule-based method constructed from human experts' knowledge. It models the decision system as a collection of concepts and causal relationships among these concepts using fuzzy logic and neural networks [148] . It, therefore, can be interpreted by experts and provides transparent information to the experts. However, it could be subjective and may not be reliable by solely relying on experts' knowledge to generate the rules. A new FCM framework was proposed recently [149] , which extracts fuzzy rules from both experts' knowledge and data using rule extraction methods.

For instance, in an European Commission funded project, euHeart Project, a probabilistic fusion framework was developed to assimilate different health data across scales (e.g., protein level ion channels flux and whole organ deformation) and functions (e.g., mechanical contraction and electrical activation), into a personalized multiphysics cardiac model by minimizing on the discrepancy between the measurements and the estimating derived from the computational model and then to discover new knowledge using the personalized model [150] . By integrating continuous and real-time sensing data from unobtrusive/wearable devices with the existing health data, the real-time prediction of acute CVD events may become possible. Zhang's team has proposed a personalized framework for quantitative assessment of the risk of acute CVD events based on vulnerable plaque rupturing mechanism as shown in Fig. 9 [151] . This framework does not only take traditional risk factors, sensitive biomarkers, blood biochemistry, vascular morphology, plaque information, and functional image information as inputs of the prediction model, but also gathers physiological information continuously from unobtrusive devices and body sensor networks as the trigger factors targeting for real-time risk assessment of acute cardiovascular events.",

For example, if we collect the health data related to cardiovascular system, including ECG, PPG, BP waveform, BCG, EEG, EMG, PTT, cardiac output, SpO 2 , body temperature, and imaging information from computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging and so on, the size of data collected from all the people in the Southern China, from all the people in the China, and from all over the world, are over 4 zettabytes, 40 zettabyes, and over 200 zettabytes per year, respectively. As of year 2012, the size of data sets that are feasible to process in a reasonable amount of time were in the order of exabytes, which means the size of health data is over one thousand times larger than the current limits. Based on the \"4 V\" definition of big data by Gartner, i.e., volume, velocity, variety and value, the characteristics of health data can be summarized as \"6 V\": vast, volume, velocity, variety, value, variation. Vast is the core feature of health data, i.e., the volume, velocity, variety, value and variation are vast. Volume refers to the size of the information. Because health data are collected from over a huge amount of people simultaneously, the velocity of the collection of health data can be extremely high. A variety of health data from genetic or molecular level like gene sequences and biomarkers to system levels such as physiological parameters and medical imaging data are now available. If we can build up a systematic analysis framework, we can definitely mine knowledge of great value from the health data.
