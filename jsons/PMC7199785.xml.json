This facility is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Eleven female ferrets weighing 0.75\u20131 kg were socially housed and placed into treatment cohorts (Tables 1 and 2); no treatment (NiV-C and HeV-C), treatment on day 1 and day 3 post-NiV challenge (NiV-1\u20133), and treatment on day 3 and 5 postchallenge with NiV (NiV-4\u20136) or HeV (HeV-1\u20133). For virus challenge and procedures, animals were anesthetized by intramuscular injection with a ketamine-acepromazine-xylazine cocktail. Animals were inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with ~5 \u00d7 103 plaque-forming units (pfu) of NiV or HeV in 1 mL Dulbecco\u2019s minimal essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) on day 0 (Figures 1A and 2A, respectively). After challenge, ferrets in the treated cohorts were given a 20 mg/kg dose of mAb h5B3.1 by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection on day 1 and 3 postchallenge for the D1/D3 cohort or day 3 and 5 postchallenge for the D3/D5 cohorts; a dosage similar to prior studies in ferrets and nonhuman primates with an antiviral human mAb [25\u201328]. Animals were anesthetized for clinical examination including temperature, respiration quality, and blood collection on days 0, 3, 6, 8, 11, 21, and 34 postchallenge. Before and after challenge, animals were assessed daily for weight, temperature, and scored on a scale of 0 of 12 for clinical observations based on coat appearance, body weight loss, social behavior, and provoked behavior; animals scoring 9 or greater were euthanized per IACUC protocol. Subjects in the h5B3.1 treatment cohorts were euthanized at the study endpoint on day 34 postchallenge.",

Filter plates, 96-well, were primed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Test sera were diluted in PBS at 1:10 for day 0 postchallenge and 1:10 000 for time points after virus challenge. Biotinylated goat antiferret IgG and streptavidin-phycoerythrin (strep-PE) (Pierce, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) were also diluted in PBS. Coupled microspheres (sG-HeV, sG-NiV) were prepared by sonication for 1 minute followed by vortex mixing for 1 minute each and then diluted in PBS. Priming liquid was removed from plates using a Bio-Plex Pro II Wash Station (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and 100 \u00b5L containing 1500 of each coupled microsphere was added to each well. The liquid was removed from the microsphere mixture by vacuum, and 100 \u00b5L of diluted test sera was added to appropriate wells and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes while shaking in the dark. Diluted test samples were removed by vacuum, and 100 \u00b5L of diluted biotinylated goat anti-ferret (1:500) was added to each well and incubated as previously described above. Liquid was removed by vacuum, and 100 \u00b5L of strep-PE (1:1000) (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) was added to each well and again incubated for 30 minutes. All liquid was removed from plates with a vacuum manifold and washed twice with 300 \u00b5L PBS, removing liquid between wash steps. Finally, 125 \u00b5L PBS was added to each well and incubated for 2 minutes as described above. Samples were assayed for mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) across at least a 100-bead region performed on the BioPlex-200 machine and analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager Software (version 6.1; Bio-Rad). The MFI and the s.d. of fluorescence intensity across 100 beads were determined for each sample and plotted.",

            "text": "We previously demonstrated in vivo protective efficacy of an anti-G cross-reactive, human mAb (m102.4) [24] against NiV-mediated disease in ferrets [25] and AGMs [26, 27]. However, a similar approach has not been examined with any cross-reactive anti-F neutralizing mAb. Earlier, we isolated and characterized a number of mouse mAbs specific to F [29], and 1 mAb (5B3) possessed strong NiV/HeV neutralizing activity and specifically recognized the prefusion conformation of the F glycoprotein trimer [29, 30]. We recently reported the cloning, sequencing, humanization of 5B3 (h5B3.1), and the cryoEM structure of 5B3 Fab in complex with NiV F, revealing its prefusion-specific quaternary epitope and defining its neutralization mechanism of locking F in the prefusion conformation and inhibiting membrane fusion [31]. To assess the efficacy of mAb h5B3.1 against NiV-mediated disease, we treated a cohort of ferrets (NiV-D1/D3) with the antibody via the i.p. route on day 1 (day = 24 hours) after a lethal i.n. inoculation of NiV with a subsequent dose of antibody on day 3 postchallenge (Figure 1A, green arrows). Based on our previous m102.4 data in AGMs [27], we were interested in examining an extended treatment window in the ferret model with h5B3.1, and an additional cohort of ferrets (NiV-D3/D5) were treated starting on day 3 postchallenge with an additional treatment on day 5 (Figure 1A, blue arrows). Both groups treated with h5B3.1 survived to the end of the study (Figure 1A), gained weight over the course of the study (Figure 1B), and had minor clinical signs of NiV-mediated disease with no observable gross pathology upon necropsy at study end point (Table 1). This is in stark contrast with the nontreated control ferret (NiV-C) that succumbed to NiV disease on day 8 postchallenge (Figure 1A) and had over 10% weight loss from day 5\u20138 postchallenge (Figure 1B). The untreated control subject, NiV-C, had clinical signs of NiV disease such as facial edema, nasal and ocular discharge, sneezing, loss of appetite, depression, labored breathing, and head and neck myoclonus (Table 1). Clinical pathology analysis revealed lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and increased BUN levels for NiV-C. Gross pathology at necropsy for NiV-C revealed lungs with pinpoint hemorrhage, an enlarged mottled spleen, diffuse reticulation of the liver, pinpoint hemorrhage of the kidneys, and congestion in the brain (Table 1).",

Based on the efficacy data of m102.4 against HeV in AGMs [28], we tested whether h5B3.1 would also have efficacy against HeV-mediated disease in the ferret model. In light of the success of h5B3.1 in preventing lethal NiV disease in ferrets in the D3/D5 cohort, we assessed the efficacy of h5B3.1 against HeV-mediated disease at only the extended treatment window, with the mAb administered via the i.p. route on day 3 after a lethal i.n. inoculation of HeV with a second dose of mAb on day 5 postchallenge (Figure 2A, arrows). The HeV-D3/D5 cohort survived to the end of the study (Figure 2A), gained weight over the course of the study (Figure 2B), and had minor clinical signs of HeV-mediated disease with no observable gross pathology upon necropsy at study end point (Table 2). However, the nontreated control ferret (HeV-C) that succumbed to HeV disease on day 9 postchallenge (Figure 2A) had over 10% weight loss from day 4 to 9 postchallenge (Figure 2B). In addition, HeV-C had clinical signs of HeV disease such as nasal and ocular discharge, sneezing, facial edema, depression, loss of appetite, and labored breathing (Table 2). Clinical pathology analysis revealed lymphopenia and hypoalbuminemia for HeV-C. Gross pathology at necropsy for HeV-C consisted of an enlarged mottled spleen, enlarged axillary lymph nodes, small focal hemorrhages of mucosal surface of the urinary bladder, serosanguinous fluid in the pleural cavity, heavily congested and hemorrhaged lung lobes, and congestion in the brain (Table 2). The disease course in the control animals infected with NiV and HeV was consistent with previous reports of henipavirus disease in ferrets [25, 32\u201336].",

However, in the absence of an active vaccination strategy, a passive immunization approach to prevent or treat viral infections can often be an effective measure [40]. Although there are presently no licensed therapeutics available to treat infection caused by HeV or NiV for use in humans, it has been demonstrated that a human mAb targeting the NiV/HeV G glycoprotein (m102.4) can provide therapeutic protection in ferrets and nonhuman primates when administered up to several days postinfection [25\u201328]. Furthermore, anti-F mouse polyclonal antibodies and mAbs were shown to protect hamsters from NiV and HeV challenge [41, 42], and in this study we examined a well characterized, cross-reactive (NiV-M, NiV-B and HeV), neutralizing humanized mAb (h5B3.1), with the potential for human use, that targets the F glycoprotein as a postinfection therapeutic.",

The 5B3 mAb and its humanized derivative, h5B3.1, target a conserved epitope in the prefusion conformation of the NiV/HeV F glycoprotein [29\u201331]. The mechanism underlying 5B3 and h5B3.1 NiV/HeV neutralization is its ability to lock F in the prefusion conformation preventing its membrane fusion activity. In this study, we explored whether h5B3.1 could also be effective in vivo in preventing lethal NiV and HeV disease in a well characterized animal model.",

All subjects that received h5B3.1 survived NiV and HeV infection; however, in contrast, our controls in the 100% lethal models succumbed. The survival of all subjects in both the NiV and HeV postchallenge groups in the present study represents an additional and major step forward towards a viable passive immunotherapeutic approach to counter NiV and HeV infection. Furthermore, the protective efficacy of h5B3.1 in preventing lethal NiV and HeV disease shown here, when administered as a postinfection therapeutic modality, provides further evidence that mAb-based therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of NiV- and HeV-infected individuals may be possible, and based on prior studies in both ferrets and nonhuman primates using another anti-NiV/HeV human mAb, therapeutic treatment will likely also reduce the possibility of infectious virus shedding [25\u201328].",

Nevertheless, the use of antibody cocktails has been either proposed and/or used in vivo for Ebola virus [44\u201346] or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [47] to prevent and/or limit the possible emergence of such mutants as well as enhance neutralization potency. Taken together, our findings here imply a similar strategy, and the combination of h5B3.1 and m102.4, or other anti-NiV/HeV mAbs, targeting antigenic sites on G and F, should be tested in future studies in the AGM model to investigate proper dosage to achieve therapeutic benefit. Indeed, such an antiviral mAb cocktail approach could be implemented for treating NiV and HeV infections in people, providing for both a viable prophylaxis against disease and possibly an effective therapeutic strategy.",
