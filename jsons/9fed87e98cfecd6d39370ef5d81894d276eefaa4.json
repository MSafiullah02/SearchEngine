            "text": "Asthma is one of the most common noncommunicable diseases in children. Studies of the epidemiology of asthma have burgeoned in the last 2 to 3 decades. This reflects worldwide concern that asthma is increasing in prevalence and is an important cause of morbidity not only in developed, but also in developing countries. 1 The hope of finding factors that influence asthma in populations that are amenable to interventions has not yet been fulfilled. This chapter gives an overview of key advances in epidemiologic knowledge that have public health and clinical relevance.",

            "text": "When a child presents to a clinician, the diagnosis of asthma is made in clinical practice by characteristic findings on history of episodic wheeze, cough, or breathlessness and usually a normal physical examination in the interval phase. Wheeze is the most frequent symptom of the variable airway obstruction that occurs in asthma. Clinical definitions are described in all pediatric asthma guidelines. For example, the British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2 and Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines 3 emphasize the exclusion of other conditions causing wheeze, cough, or breathlessness, especially in the very young child. More recently, there has been a focus on clarifying the definition of wheezing in preschool children with two categories proposed: episodic viral wheeze and multiple trigger wheeze. 4 Epidemiologic studies investigate populations rather than individuals, and thus the methods of assessment need to be appropriate for this task. Measurements are made in individuals from which the presence or absence of asthma is determined, and thus the population prevalence or incidence is estimated, sometimes with characterization by severity or some other parameter. When comparisons are made between populations (and within populations at different points in time), it is vital that the same standardized methods are used to ensure confidence in the estimates obtained.",

            "text": "The most common approach in epidemiologic studies is the use of written questionnaires completed by the parent for younger age groups and self-reported by adolescents. The latter may report a higher rate of symptoms than reported by the parent for the same adolescents. 5-7 This may be caused by a greater awareness of milder symptoms in the adolescent, or symptoms occurring when the parent is not present and not reported to the parent. An asthma symptoms video questionnaire was developed in 1992 in response to possible translation problems with written questionnaires used between populations who speak different languages, some of whom have no word for wheeze. The video shows scenes of young people with asthma, thereby avoiding the need to describe symptoms verbally. The validity of the video has been investigated by comparison with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] and most studies show a close relationship. Its relationship to the written questionnaire is close between populations, 14 but within populations the prevalence estimates are lower with the video questionnaire, 15 and its relationship within individuals is not clearcut. 10, [16] [17] [18] [19] Questions about more recent symptoms (in the last 12 months) are more reliable than questions about symptoms in the past because they reduce errors of recall. The most commonly used standard question is \"Have you (has your child) had wheezing or whistling in the chest in the last 12 months?\" When the answer is yes, the term current wheeze is commonly used. Parental report of wheeze over the past 12 months has been shown to have a range of sensitivity of 0.58 to 0.88 and a specificity of 0.64 to 0.95 for physician diagnosis of childhood asthma. [20] [21] [22] Provided that the information has been collected in a standardized manner, any information biases are expected to be in both directions, thus enabling reliable comparisons between populations. 23 In view of some of the potential limitations of questionnaires, there has been a search for an objective \"asthma test\" from which the diagnosis can be made with certainty. In the late 1970s, a test of nonspecific BHR was suggested as an objective test for diagnosing asthma and assessing its severity. 24,25 BHR is measured using a nonspecific inhaled challenge such as methacholine, histamine, or hypertonic M.

In 1990, Pattemore and colleagues reported a study of an unbiased community sample in New Zealand in which they found that the level of BHR was a poorer predictor of doctor diagnosis of asthma than responses to the question \"Has your child had wheezing in the last 12 months?\" on written questionnaires. 27 Although there was a trend for greater BHR among children with more severe symptoms, the confidence intervals showed a large overlap between groups. Similar observations have been made in subsequent population-based studies. 28, 29 Thus BHR, while related to asthma, is not equivalent to asthma.",

Care must be taken in the interpretation of study findings because of the many factors that may influence asthma. 23 The randomized trial has rarely been used in epidemiologic studies. Cross-sectional studies are most suitable for estimating the prevalence of asthma symptoms, diagnosis, and severity; relating these to other measured factors, and generating hypotheses. Most such studies have been within populations, but in 1985 the first study between centers in different countries was completed. 30 This was followed by several other comparisons between populations, and then in 1992 the International Study of Asthma and Allergies (ISAAC) was established, a multiphase cross-sectional study that became the largest epidemiologic study of asthma in children ever undertaken. 31 ISAAC used a simple standardized methodology with written and video questionnaires about asthma symptoms in Phases One and Three 14,32,33 with a conventional crosssectional study design. Phase Two, which used more intensive standardized modules to make comparisons between populations (centers), followed the cross-sectional design with case control analyses. 34, 35 Case control studies identify children with asthma and a control group of children without asthma, and then follow with a comparison of exposure of cases and controls to factors of interest (e.g., environmental tobacco smoke).",

However, ecological analyses are appropriate for attempting to explain why prevalence varies between populations and for putting the results of individual-level epidemiologic studies within populations in context. 38 ISAAC has therefore used ecological studies to identify associations that may be worthy of further investigation. 39 Longitudinal studies (cohort studies) involve repeated observation of participants over time and may also include a series of cross-sectional measurements. These studies are particularly useful in identifying determinants of asthma and its expression over the life course. See the Natural History section later in the chapter for several examples of these studies. Caution is needed in comparing one cohort study with another, as a recent analysis found 60 different definitions of asthma from 122 publications from cohort studies. 40 Studies that measure the incidence of asthma (number of new cases per year) involve long periods of time and especially large resources.",

In adolescents, self-reported prevalence of wheeze in the past 12 months (current wheeze) varied from 32.6% in Wellington (New Zealand) to 0.8% in Tibet (China). Thirty-five centers (15%) had a prevalence of current wheeze \u226520%, and these were mostly from the English language countries and Latin America. Twenty-two centers (9.4%) had a prevalence of <5%, and they were mostly in the Indian subcontinent, Asia Pacific, Eastern Mediterranean, and Northern and Eastern Europe ( Fig. 44-1) . In children, parent-reported current wheeze ranged from 37.6% in Costa Rica to 2.4% in Jodhpur (India). Twenty-one centers (14.6%) had a prevalence of current wheeze \u226520%, and all but two were English language countries or Latin America. Seventeen centers (11.8%) had a prevalence of <5%, and these were mostly from the Indian subcontinent, Asia-Pacific, and Northern and Eastern Europe ( Fig. 44-2) . The size and location of these differences suggests that environmental factors are the most likely explanation for the global variations.",

In the United States, two studies have found differing results. In Arkansas, asthma prevalence was similar between representative rural and urban groups, but asthma morbidity was higher in the rural group. 61 However, in Wisconsin, asthma was less commonly reported among farm-reared rural children than among non-farm-reared rural children. 62 Thus different aspects of the rural environment need exploration. Other studies of the effect of the farming environment on the occurrence of asthma, especially in European settings, suggest that microbial exposure may be a potentially protective effect resulting in low asthma prevalence in rural environments (see Infection, Immunization, and Microbial Exposure later in the chapter). 63",

In 1975 to 1976 in the first of these studies, Tokelauan children were observed in two environments. Asthma was more than twice more common among Tokelauan children in New Zealand than in Tokelau. Among children examined in New Zealand, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of asthma between those born in New Zealand and those born in Tokelau. 64 Among Asian immigrants from Pakistan, India, and East Africa in Blackburn, U.K, there was an increasing rate of asthma symptoms with increasing duration of stay in the U.K. 65 In Melbourne, Australia, the prevalence of wheeze was higher in Australian-born Asians and non-Asians than in Asian immigrants, and it was also strongly associated with length of stay in Australia. 43 In the ISAAC Australia study, asthma prevalence was higher among Australian-born children than among those born elsewhere. 66 In teenagers in Melbourne, Australia, there was an effect of length of residence on the prevalence of symptoms in subjects born outside Australia and now living in Melbourne. 67 Children born in the United States were more likely than children born outside of the United States to have current asthma. 68 A study in Israel showed that the prevalence of asthma symptoms was higher in native-born Israelis compared with Ethiopian immigrants, lower compared with immigrants from Western countries, and similar to immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The younger the age at which immigrants from the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia arrived in Israel, the higher their prevalence of asthma at 17 years of age. 69 Among Mexican Americans in the United States, children who were born in the United States had higher rates of asthma than their Mexican-born peers, and most were influenced by where they were born, age at immigration, and duration of U.S. residence. [70] [71] [72] Most recently, in ISAAC Phase Three (a global study), adolescents who were immigrants had fewer symptoms of asthma than those born in their new country. The effect diminished with increasing duration of residence in the adopted country. 73",

As these were the majority of centers who undertook ISAAC Phase One, this reflected the large worldwide interest in time trends of prevalence. Following reports from English language countries in the 1990s of increases in asthma prevalence from the 1980s, continuing increases in prevalence had been expected. However, in most high-prevalence countries, particularly the English language countries, the prevalence of asthma symptoms changed little between Phase One and Phase Three, and even declined in some cases. 33 In contrast, a number of countries that had high or intermediate levels of symptom prevalence in Phase One showed significant increases in prevalence in Phase Three. Examples include Latin American countries (e.g., Costa Rica, Panama, Mexico, Argentina, and Chile) and Eastern European countries (e.g., the Ukraine and Romania). Other countries with significant increases in symptom prevalence included Barbados, Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria. With the exception of India, all of the countries with very low symptom prevalence rates in Phase One reported increases in prevalence in Phase Three, though only the increases for Indonesia and China were statistically significant. The percentage of children and adolescents reported to have ever had asthma increased significantly, possibly reflecting greater awareness of this condition and/or changes in diagnostic practice.",

The prevalence of asthma increased in children 2-to 3-fold, but it may have flattened or even fallen recently while current trends in adult prevalence were flat. The prevalence of a lifetime diagnosis of asthma increased in all age groups. The incidence of new asthma episodes presenting to general practitioners increased in all ages to a plateau in the mid-1990s and declined since then. During the 1990s, the annual prevalence of new cases of asthma and of treated asthma in general practice showed no major change. 93 There have been other aspects of time trends studied. In the first report of ethnic-specific time trends of asthma prevalence within a country using ISAAC data, the prevalence in children increased in Ma \u2212 ori and Pacific populations and decreased in European populations over a 10-year period, but there were no significant differences in adolescents. 94 In a gender-related time-trend study in Aberdeen, Scotland, from 1989 to 2004 in children 9 to 11 years of age, the male-to-female ratio significantly narrowed for wheeze. 95",

However, there needs to be caution about comparing parent-reported symptoms in younger children to self-reported symptoms in adolescents, as the latter may report a higher rate of symptoms than the parent for the same adolescents. [5] [6] [7] Gender Gender differences in asthma symptom prevalence are present throughout the childhood years, but the pattern changes with age. In preschool children in Sweden, the age-specific asthma prevalence from 1 to 6 years of age showed somewhat higher levels for boys than for girls. 96 There are consistent reports of higher asthma symptom prevalence in school boys than girls. In adolescents, there is a mixed picture with considerable variation between countries, but, on average, prevalence in teenage girls is slightly higher than in teenage boys. These reports come from the United States, 97 the United Kingdom, 98 and from ISAAC Phase One in 156 centers in 56 countries in children 6 to 7 years of age and 13 to 14 years of age. 14 In a cross-sectional study in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, asthma prevalence was more frequent and severe among girls than boys. 99 A recent review of the literature confirmed these observations; they found that boys were consistently reported to have more prevalent wheeze and asthma than girls. In adolescence, the pattern changes and onset of wheeze is more prevalent in females than in males. A further recent study found that asthma, after childhood, is more severe in females than in males and is relatively underdiagnosed and undertreated in female adolescents. 100 However, in contrast a very large study of Californian adolescent males and females exhibited nearly the same patterns of prevalence. 101 The factors that influence the differences in gender-related expression of disease are not known, but suggestions include parental atopy, 102 and hormonal changes with maturation.",

Paternal history was a stronger risk factor for wheeze in females than in males. 102 In Aberdeen, Scotland, in four repeated cross-sectional studies over a 15-year period, the male-to-female ratio significantly narrowed for wheeze, partly caused by disappearance of the bias to diagnose asthma in symptomatic males but not in females, suggesting that other environmental factors enhancing the expression of asthma and atopy in females could be explored in future research. 95",

            "text": "Until the last decade, relatively few studies investigated the comparative prevalence in indigenous children compared with the colonizing populations and more recent immigrants. A range of differences has been found, generally showing a more clinical symptoms among indigenous children. In ISAAC Phase One in New Zealand, greater severity among Ma \u2212 ori (indigenous) and Pacific children (Polynesian not indigenous) was found. 104 In ISAAC Phase Three 8 to 10 years later, the prevalence of current wheeze was higher in Ma \u2212 ori and Pacific children compared with European/Pakeha children, and it was higher in Ma \u2212 ori and European/Pakeha adolescents than in Pacific adolescents. Ma \u2212 ori populations had a higher prevalence of almost all severe symptoms compared with European/Pakeha populations. 94 In a study of Canadian children living in northern and remote communities, Aboriginal children had significantly lower prevalence of asthma ever, while the prevalence of wheeze was similar to non-Aboriginal children. 105 Studies in children of different ethnicities (nonindigenous) within countries have shown ethnic differences. In nationally representative U.S. samples among currently symptomatic children 3 to17 years of age, Mexican children had a lower prevalence and Puerto Ricans had a higher prevalence of asthma symptoms than non-Hispanic African-American and white children. 106,107 Among children from different Asian-American subgroups, a wide variation occurred in asthma prevalence. 68 The causes of ethnic differences in prevalence are complex. It is not straightforward to separate socioeconomic influences from ethnicity, as commonly indigenous people and non-white ethnic groups are usually relatively socioeconomically disadvantaged compared with white groups. To illustrate this in a nationally representative U.S. sample of children 3 years of age, asthma prevalence declined with increasing income for non-African-American but not African-American children. 108 In New York children 4 to 13 years of age, asthma prevalence within different ethnic and income groups was consistently lower in neighborhoods of greater socioeconomic status, except among Puerto Rican children, who had high asthma prevalence, regardless of school attended or income. 109 Differences in symptomatology may reflect differences in disease management, 104 inequalities in access to care, 94 or other factors. In the U.K. millennium cohort at 3 years of age, more Black Caribbean children and fewer Bangladeshi children reported ever asthma and recent wheeze compared with white children. After adjustments, the disadvantage in asthma and recent wheeze for Black Caribbeans was mostly explained by socioeconomic factors. However, for Bangladeshi children, asthma and wheezing illnesses appeared to be underreported, accounted for by the recentness of migration and low English language use, suggesting that potential explanations for observed differences may be different between ethnic groups. 110 In a very large study of Californian adolescents, an increased risk was observed for asthma and BMI, and there were no substantial differences in this basic pattern found between the six examined racial/ethnic groups. 101 Different types of risks may contribute to variations in asthma morbidity for urban children from specific ethnic groups with asthma whose health outcomes lag far behind their non-Latino white counterparts. 111 These findings are reinforced by a conceptual model related to four main domains that has been developed to explain asthma health disparities in Latino children in the United States: the individual and family, the environment or context in which the child lives, the health care system, and provider characteristics (with potential mechanisms). 112",

Precise quantification is difficult due to differences in definition, geographical prevalence, asthma severity, and the complexity of its impact. Asthma burden is also changing. While it has been high in the developed world for some time, it is increasingly being felt in developing countries where prevalence is rising. Asthma's burden has multiple components that act at different levels (child, family, and society), as shown in Table 44-1. Perception of burden is highly individual and influenced more by health care utilization than objective measures. Parents may perceive high burden, even in children with objectively mild intermittent asthma. 113 On the other hand, high medication use and frequent health care visits are associated with higher perceived burden yet better control (as defined by hospital bed days). Studies consistently demonstrate disparities in both objective and perceived asthma burden according to ethnicity and socioeconomic status, likely a reflection of capacity to access and implement effective therapy. 113 Baydar and colleagues found that ethnic disparity in burden all but disappeared when comparing families with the same health care access and degree of asthma control. 113 Uniquely they also examined how perceived and actual burden changed over time. Those engaged in \"asthma control activities\" including high levels of effort toward medication adherence and non-emergency health care visits had more favorable perceived and actual burden levels. Despite the advent of effective pharmaceuticals and management guidelines emphasizing proactive care, a large proportion of children with asthma have poor control and reactive health care. 114 An estimated one third of the direct economic costs and up to three quarters of the total economic costs are caused by inadequate treatment resulting in poor control. 115 Indicators of asthma burden will be reviewed later in the chapter.",

In those who wheezed at any time, over 12% had at least weekly wheeze-induced sleep disturbance. The rates were even higher in another multinational study. 114 Rabe and colleagues 114 surveyed over 3000 children and nearly 8000 adults with asthma across 29 countries including North America, Europe, and Asia.

            "text": "Children with asthma are at greater risk of psychological problems, especially those involving internalization. Many studies have suggested a bidirectional relationship between mental and physical health in asthma operating at internal (psychoneuroimmunologic) and external (behavior and therapy adherence) levels. 125 Children with asthma are more likely to experience anger, fear, frustration, anxiety, loneliness, and guilt than controls. 126 It frequently restricts participation in sporting and social activities and may even limit choices such as family pets. 126 Gender differences have been observed in both quality of life scores and how children adapt to the burden of asthma. Consistent with many reports, a recent Swedish study of children attending a specialist clinic found that quality of life scores were significantly poorer in girls than in boys, despite severe asthma being twice as common among the boys. 126 Girls appear more likely to incorporate asthma and asthma therapy into their personal identities, while boys attempt to exclude or deny it. 126 While quality of life measures are seen as important indicators in chronic disease, quality of life is not necessarily lower in those with chronic illness than in healthy controls. 125 In children, the relationship between asthma severity and quality of life has been inconsistent. Studies comparing diseases have found that childhood asthma fairs better than diabetes, cystic fibrosis, or rheumatoid arthritis in quality of life scores. 127 In fact, children in the aforementioned Swedish study scored toward the top end of the quality of life range despite having frequent symptoms. 126 Nevertheless, maintaining quality of life, particularly in the emotional parameters, may be an important marker for successful management of and adaption to asthma. Goldbeck and colleagues found that psychological factors were greater determinants of quality of life in asthma than asthma severity. 125 They found no correlation between asthma severity and emotional or behavioral symptoms but did find that psychological problems impaired asthma management. Another study reported that symptoms of mild to moderate depression were common in adolescents with asthma and strongly associated with disease activity. 128 The authors speculated that the emotional symptoms caused the increased asthma activity, not the reverse. Over one third of parents also scored in the depressive range. While there was correlation between child and parental depression scores, there was no correlation between parental depression and child asthma severity.",

Asthma hospital admission rates vary considerably between hospitals within the same city, regionally within a country, and between neighboring countries. 129-131 Although some of this variability is caused by differences in disease prevalence and severity, other factors also contribute, including variability in primary care, admitting practices, and the organization of acute inpatient facilities.

            "text": "While asthma mortality is complex, trends can be viewed as resulting from changes in asthma prevalence and changes in asthma case fatality. In the 1960s, asthma mortality rates increased 2-to 10-fold within a 2-to 5-year period in Australia, England and Wales, New Zealand, Norway, and Scotland, but there was no increase observed in Canada, Denmark, Germany, or the United States. Peak mortality rates during these epidemics were from 2 to 3 per 100,000 persons 5 to 34 years of age, lasting 10 to 15 years in affected countries. 187 Considering asthma prevalence, these epidemics resulted from a rapid increase in case fatality. While there may not be a single explanation, pharmaceutical usage and in particular the introduction of isoprenaline forte inhalers likely played a major role. 93, 187 A further epidemic of asthma deaths occurred from 1976 to 1989, most noticeably in, but not confined to, New Zealand. 184 During this period the asthma mortality rate in New Zealand was the highest in the world, peaking in 1979 at 4.1 per 100,000 persons 5 to 34 years of age (see Fig. 44 -3). 184, 188, 189 The use of the potent and less selective \u03b2 2 agonist fenoterol is considered the major factor. 184, [190] [191] [192] Asthma mortality rates decreased rapidly in New Zealand following warnings and subsequent restrictions of the sale of fenoterol. 193 Unlike the asthma mortality epidemics, the rising endemic asthma mortality seen until the 1990s does not appear to be caused by a single predominant factor and may reflect rising overall prevalence rather than increased case fatality. Mortality, hospitalization, and incidence rates all increased over this same time period. 187 The increases were substantial, with a median increase in mortality of 45% in 15 developed countries from 1975-1977 to 1985-1987. 187 The increases occurred in a wide range of countries with differing lifestyles, and they were variable in countries with similar lifestyles. A wide range of age groups was affected. For example, in the United States, from 1980 to 1993, increases were evident in the 0-to 4-year, 5-to 14-year, and 15-to 24-year age groups. 194 Although the trend across developed countries for asthma mortality to increase was consistent, there was considerable variability between countries in pediatric The Epidemiology of Asthma asthma mortality rates. For example, from 1981 to 1990, in the 5-to 14-year age group, mortality rates ranged from 0.38 per 100,000 per year in Sweden to 1.75 per 100,000 per year in New Zealand. 194 Asthma mortality rates have decreased in both children and adults since the late 1980s in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, England, Wales, Spain, and West Germany and since the mid-1990s in the United States.* Over the same time period as this decrease in asthma mortality, asthma prevalence and severity has been stable or has increased. This suggests that improved management of asthma has contributed to the reduced mortality and the introduction of inhaled and systemic steroids, together with consensus guidelines, have been credited. 93, 186, [200] [201] [202] Simplistically, increasing asthma mortality prior to the mid-1990s may be attributed to increases in underlying prevalence, epidemics caused by particular pharmaceuticals, and the subsequent decrease in mortality caused by improved treatment, in particular inhaled and systemic steroids.",

            "text": "Numerous risk factors for fatal asthma have been identified. The most important are asthma severity, age, ethnicity, and poverty, although patterns of health behavior, including therapy adherence, are likely also important. Two patterns of presentation are often observed. The most frequent is one of delayed presentation in someone known to have severe asthma, but in whom the severity of the fatal attack is underestimated or escalation in treatment is delayed. The second pattern is rapid, unexpected deterioration and death, and this may occur in an individual who was previously identified as having only mild asthma. 203, 204 Genetic, Ethnic, and Socioeconomic Determinants Genes, environment (including exposures, lifestyle, and health behaviors), and gene by environment interactions encompass all the potential determinants of disease severity and risk of fatality. Asthma mortality is greatest in lowto moderate-income countries and countries where access to asthma medications (particularly \"controller\" medications) and health care are limited. 182,205 Within individual countries, asthma fatality is higher in those from the lowest socioeconomic households. 144, 206, 207 Socioeconomics and ethnicity are often difficult to disentangle, however, at least one U.S. study found both to be independent risk factors for asthma death. 206 Socioeconomic disadvantage is likely through both increased adverse exposures and poorer health care access. 142,208 Poorer educational achievement is also associated with increased mortality, as both a consequence of poverty and as an independent risk factor. 206 While there is considerable interest in the genetic influences for asthma, there is little evidence of specific genetic risk factors for fatality at the time of this writing. Asthma case-fatality varies greatly by ethnicity. However, it is more likely a reflection of environmental factors such as health behaviors, health care access, and the influence of poverty rather than a reflection of race-based genetics. 192 The New Zealand Ma \u2212 ori, the United States African-American, and the Australian Aborigine populations all have considerably higher asthma mortality (RR 2-5) than the European ethnicities and were more greatly affected during asthma death epidemics. 144, 206, 207, 209, 210 Nevertheless, important biological and genetic differences may exist. Steroid therapy is thought to have been influential in reducing asthma mortality, and African-American individuals may be less sensitive to glucorticoid action. 211 Genetic polymorphisms for the \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptor influence beta agonist therapy efficacy. For example, significant differences in bronchodilator res ponsiveness, probability of wheeze, and exacerbation rates have been seen comparing those homozygous for Arg16 with those homozygous for Gly16. 212, 213 Another gene, RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) causes chemotaxis and activation of several cell types involved in the asthmatic airway inflammatory response including eosinophils, monocytes, basophils, and T cells. A polymorphism for this gene has been described that is present at increased frequency in Taiwanese children with near-fatal asthma compared to those with mild to moderate asthma and compared with Taiwanese nonasthmatic children. 214 Gene by environment interaction is likely to be important and is poorly accounted for in current research. For example, tobacco smoke exposure appears to influence the impact of the Arg16 and Gly16 alleles. 212 While allele frequency does vary between ethnicities (e.g., the \u03b2 2adrenergic receptor polymorphism Glu27 is much less common in African-American individuals), it remains unclear how much influence this has on ethnic differences in asthma severity, hospitalization, and mortality. 212, 215 While not specifically addressing the question of genetics versus environment, asthma mortality risk is heritable. Teerlink and colleagues found that the risk of dying from asthma was proportionate to \"relatedness\" with others who had died of asthma. 216 The relative risk was 1.7 for a first-degree relative and 1.3 for a second-degree relative. In addition, they utilized a genealogic index of familiarity to index familial aggregations, showing an \"excess of relatedness\" in fatal asthma.",

Male gender, high rate of regular shortacting \u03b22-agonist use, and poor adherence are risk factors for both; however, those with near-fatal asthma tend to be younger, have a slower onset of asthma symptoms, and are more likely to have concurrent infection and use more inhaled corticosteroids. 220 Psychological factors appear to make a significant contribution of the risk of death in children with severe asthma. 222 A case control study compared children hospitalized with severe asthma who died over the subsequent months to years with a control group of children with asthma of similar severity. Factors apparent during the hospital admission that were associated with an increased risk of subsequent fatal asthma included conflict about asthma management between parents and hospital staff, age-inappropriate self-care of asthma, depressive symptoms, and disregard of asthma symptoms. 223 While exercise may precipitate asthma symptoms, a diagnosis of asthma is not uncommon in children and young people participating in sports at recreational and competitive levels. While death caused by asthma during sporting activities has been described, it is poorly defined. Becker and colleagues found, in the United States, that European ethnicity, male gender, and age between 10 and 20 years were risk factors for sportsrelated asthma deaths and that individuals generally had only mild, if sometimes persistent asthma. 224 As with exercise, physiologic changes at night and during sleep also precipitate asthma symptoms. While a diurnal pattern in asthma mortality has not been reported, exacerbations that begin during the night are more likely to be fatal in children. 225 This may be the result of physiology; however, these children were slower to receive \"rescue\" therapy, perhaps caused by lower parental supervision at night.",

Unlike monogenic diseases such as cystic fibrosis (where alterations in a single gene explain much of the disease's development and which has simple Mendelian inheritance), the genetic determinants of asthma are much more complex. Multiple genes are involved (polygenetic inheritance), different combinations of genes act in different families (genetic heterogeneity), and the same gene or set of genes influences multiple traits (pleiotropy) (e.g., asthma and eczema). Furthermore, gene by gene and gene by environment interaction appears to be very important.",

            "text": "Like other aspects of asthma, genetic research is complicated by a lack of consistent diagnostic criteria or definition for asthma. Investigation has often focused on atopy, elevated IgE, and evidence of BHR. The varying asthma phenotypes, including age of onset, further complicate the exploration of associated genes. Outside the laboratory, evidence for genetic influence on asthma comes from family studies, ethnic and geographical disparity, and twin studies. Some caution needs to be taken with inheritance data because children inherit not just genes but environmental exposures and health behaviors. Exposure to environmental antigens begins antenatally. 235 Nevertheless a recent review, sourcing studies from over 20 countries from all geographical regions of the world, found that a family history of asthma was consistently associated with increased asthma risk. 236 Odds ratios for a first-degree relative ranged from 1.5 to 9.7. While individual studies varied, overall the risk associated with maternal, paternal, or sibling history of asthma was similar. The risk increased if more than one parent was affected. Similarly, a family history of atopy elevated asthma risk. An extension of family history studies, segregation analysis can yield more detailed relationships. Unsurprisingly, given current understandings of asthma genetics, segregation studies have come to varying conclusions regarding inheritance: mixed, co-dominant, single locus, and polygenic. 235 Among the phenotypic characteristics examined, total IgE appears most likely to be majorly influenced by a single gene, although the inheritance remains unclear. 235 As noted, substantial differences in prevalence exist by region, by ethnicity, and over time. While it is unlikely that genetics explains the rapid changes observed in the last half century, it may contribute to some of the ethnic disparity given different frequencies of gene polymorphisms. Numerous twin studies in asthma have been published utilizing self-report diagnosis, IgE and allergy testing, and lung function tests. 235 They attribute 36% to 75% of the variance in asthma risk to genetics.",

            "text": "Advances in technology and techniques have allowed increasingly sophisticated investigation of genetic determinants. Candidate gene association, genome-wide linkage, and, most recently, genome-wide association (GWA) studies, largely utilizing case-control cohorts, have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with asthma and/or aspects of asthma control. Well over 100 genes have been associated with asthma or atopy-related phenotypes, with at least 40 replicated in two or more independent samples. 237-241 For example, ADAM33 is thought to alter the hypertrophic response of bronchial smooth muscle to inflammation. While the associations may be strong, the individual effects sizes (~odds ratio) are generally small (OR 0.5 to 1.5), and future research will need to determine not only the functions of identified polymorphisms but also how they interact with each other and the environment. 237 It remains to be seen how many of these prove to be true susceptibility genes. In contrast to the linkage studies, GWA permits research that is not hypothesis-driven and therefore the potential discovery of totally novel genes and/or pathophysiology. In these studies, the genomes of large numbers of individuals within a case-control cohort can be examined seeking associations between asthma phenotypes and individual genes. The first GWA study in childhood asthma, published in 2007 lead to the discovery of three polymorphisms (including ORMDL3) on Chromosome 17p21. These findings have been confirmed in other studies across diverse ethnic populations. 242 While the mechanisms are still to be elucidated, they are strongly associated with an early-onset asthma that remits in early adulthood. 243 As asthma phenotypes are age-related, achieving understanding of its genetic etiology may prove difficult with cross-sectional studies, and long-term longitudinal genetic studies will likely be required. 244 Similarly studies will need to carefully examine environmental exposures. Investigations on a polymorphism in the promoter of CD14 have shown that the same variant may lead to distinct transcriptional patterns if the gene is expressed at different times and/or different cell types. 241 It exhibits a protective effect against increased IgE levels in children with intermediate exposure to farm animals, whereas high levels of IgE were observed in children with high animal exposure. The same polymorphism can therefore be linked to different and even opposite phenotypes, depending on environmental conditions. ORMDL3, ADAM33, and CD14 are merely examples of the many polymorphisms being identified. As yet, they have limited clinical utility, however research methods and findings are progressing very rapidly. While asthma genetics are complex, they hold great promise, potentially yielding new opportunities in prevention, prognostication, and therapeutics.",

            "text": "The Relationship Between Asthma, Atopy, and Allergy Atopy Atopy (from Greek \"strangeness\") is defined as \"a personal, and/or familial tendency to produce IgE antibodies in response to ordinary exposure to allergens, usually proteins.\" 245 Asthma in children is commonly described as an allergic, IgE-mediated, atopic disease. The proposed process is that allergen exposure produces allergic sensitization and that continual exposure leads to clinical asthma through the development of airways inflammation, BHR, and reversible airflow obstruction. Various measures of atopy (e.g., positive skin-prick tests, elevated serum IgE levels, parental history of asthma) are associated with an increased risk of developing asthma. 246 For example, in the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (Arizona, U.S.), when compared with children who had not wheezed, a larger proportion of children with persistent wheezing were more likely to have mothers with a history of asthma, elevated serum IgE levels at 9 months of age, or positive skin skinprick tests for aeroallergens. Positive skin-prick tests for aeroallergens were also associated with an increased risk of late-onset wheezing. 246 In Avon, U.K., in the ALSPAC study, at 7 years wheezing onset after 18 months was most strongly associated with atopy and airway responsiveness. 247 Atopy causes an increased risk for persistence and severity of asthma, and this is discussed in the Natural History section later in the chapter.",

            "text": "There may be an interaction between atopy and infections. In a small study of asthmatic children, the duration of BHR after a single natural cold was 5 to 11 weeks. However, an increased rate of symptomatic cold and asthma episodes in atopic children was associated with considerable cumulative prolongation of BHR, which might help explain the role of atopy as a risk factor for asthma persistence. 248 Sly has proposed a two-hit model for asthma in which airway inflammation triggered by viral infection or allergy during postnatal lung growth disrupts underlying tissue differentiation programs, leading to anomalies in respiratory function, which last for long periods later in life. Although both allergy and respiratory infections during early life are independently associated with risk for subsequent development of asthma, the highest odds ratios for persistent asthma are seen in children who have both. 249 ISAAC confirmed a strong correlation between symptoms of asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and also atopic eczema. 50 However, in this cross-sectional study most children had current symptoms of only one condition, and less than 1 in 10 symptomatic children had current symptoms of all three diseases. Some of this lack of concurrent symptoms may be explained by the \"atopic march,\" with eczema occurring in the youngest children, followed by asthma and later by allergic rhinitis. However, the lack of overlap-even for \"symptoms ever\"-was less than expected if the explanatory mechanism were the same for all three conditions. A recent systematic review found that although there is an increased risk of developing asthma after eczema in early childhood, only one in three children with eczema develops asthma during later childhood. 250 This is lower than previously assumed. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that the risk of subsequent childhood asthma is not increased in children with early atopic dermatitis who are not also early wheezers, suggesting that a co-manifestation of phenotypes rather than a progressive atopic march may be the explanation. 251 However, atopy does not explain the many children with asthma who do not have an atopic constitution. In 1999, Pearce and colleagues challenged the closeness of the relationship between asthma and atopy. 252 The epidemiologic evidence suggests that only 50% of the child and adult population with asthma have IgE-mediated disease. Comparisons across populations or time periods showed only a weak and inconsistent association between the prevalence of atopy and asthma. Nonallergic asthma may be a separate entity from allergic asthma, and a different set of preventive strategies may be required for this type of asthma. The etiology of and risk factors for non-IgE-mediated asthma therefore need to be explored further. 252 Comparatively little research has been done in this direction.",

In addition, atopy did not increase significantly in the subgroups of populations subdivided by asthma quartiles. In both subgroups, however, atopic asthma increased with increasing atopy or with increasing asthma. 255 Further evidence of the diminished agency of atopy for asthma came from a recent study of bronchial biopsies obtained from 55 children 2 to 10 years of age undergoing bronchoscopy for appropriate clinical indications (not asthma). This showed that the airway pathology typical of asthma is present in non-atopic wheezing children just as in atopic wheezing children. These results suggest that, when multitrigger wheezing responsive to bronchodilators is present, it is associated with pathologic features of asthma, even in non-atopic children. 256 The role of atopic sensitization in determining asthma prevalence in children was explored further in ISAAC Phase Two, a multicenter cross-sectional study of 9-to 11-year-old school children in randomly sampled schools in 30 centers in 22 countries. Skin-prick test reactivity was used as the measure of atopy. The mean effect size (odds ratio) for skin-prick test reactivity on current wheeze in affluent countries was about double that of nonaffluent countries, which is where most of the world's children live. 35 Thus the relationship between atopy and asthma is important, but it may have been overemphasized to the detriment of exploration of the nonallergic mechanisms of asthma.",

Wahn and colleagues concluded that allergen intervention needs to begin in early life. However, it is still being clarified whether this applies in other parts of the world and to what extent sensitization leads to clinical disease. In ISAAC Phase Two, in non-affluent countries a higher proportion of children with positive skin-prick tests had no detectable specific IgE than in affluent countries. Total serum IgE was associated with asthma symptoms among children with both positive skin-prick tests and specific IgE. 259 Many studies show that persistent asthma is associated with exposure to allergens in the indoor environment. Also, typical outdoor allergens such as pollens are also regularly found indoors, but they are rarely an independent risk factor for persistent asthma. 260 In many temperate and humid regions, the greatest risk for asthma has been associated with allergy to HDM. 261 In Australia, the association between exposure to HDM, sensitization, and asthma is very strong. Increased use of nonfeather pillows, which have less tightly woven encasements and more allergens, appeared to explain a modest rise in prevalence of wheeze over a 13-year period in London. 262 In some dry climates, the strongest risk factor is allergy to the fungus Alternaria spp. 263, 264 In other urban communities, allergy to cockroach appears to be the dominant allergen and is strongly associated with asthma risk, but it is not clear if this is independent of socioeconomic status 265, 266 Allergy to cats and dogs appears to be important in many places, 267 but in a study of children in the Netherlands, pet ownership (cats, dogs, birds, and/or rodents in the home) was associated with a lower prevalence of respiratory allergy and symptoms. However, past, but not current pet ownership was associated with a higher prevalence of symptoms and pet allergy. These results suggest that selective avoidance and removal of pets leads to distortion of cross-sectional associations of pet ownership and respiratory allergy and disease among children. 268 In a prospective study in Oslo, Norway, in children 10 years of age, no risk modification was seen for dog allergens. 269 In adolescents in Norway, sensitization to pet allergens (i.e., cat, dog, and horse) was associated with increased BHR in children with asthma, but it did not increase the risk of being sensitized to pet allergens. 270 In Sweden, early exposure to cats and dogs appeared to have a protective effect on the development of IgE sensitization. 271 However, in a study in New Delhi, India, dogs and cats at home were significant risk factors associated with the symptoms of asthma in schoolchildren. 272 Nonallergic effects of exposure to animals are discussed in the Housing, Animals, and Climate section later in the chapter.",

In the setting of occupational asthma in adults, continuing exposure to the relevant occupational allergen is generally associated with a higher risk of persisting asthma, although the relationship may be more complex than this. 278 Exposure-response relationships may be influenced by properties of the allergen or route of exposure, the genotype of the exposed individual, and environmental agents (e.g., endotoxin). Recommendations have been made to reduce exposure for young children already sensitized to HDM, pets, or cockroaches to prevent the onset of allergic disease, and to eliminate or reduce the exposure of asthma patients who are allergic to indoor allergens (e.g., HDM, cockroaches, and animal danders) to improve symptoms and to control and prevent exacerbations. 254 This might be achieved by chemical, physical, and combined methods of reducing mite allergen levels. However, a recent Cochrane Systematic Review that assessed the effects of reducing exposure to house dust mite antigens in the homes of people with mite-sensitive asthma found no effect of the interventions on number of patients whose asthma improved, asthma symptom scores, or medication usage. If any further trials are done, they need to be larger and more methodologically rigorous and must use other methods than those used so far, with careful monitoring of mite exposure and relevant clinical outcomes. 279 These findings suggest that reducing allergen exposure is unlikely to make an important impact on the burden of asthma in populations.",

In a study from Israel 17-year-old adolescents had a higher risk of asthma if they had birth weights less than 2500 grams, but the mechanisms were not clear. 282 In a U.S. nationally representative sample, the prevalence of childhood asthma decreased as birthweight increased. 283 The relationship between low birth weight and asthma needs to be explored further, especially with studies from developing countries.",

            "text": "The prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents has increased in Western countries due to changes in diet and physical activity associated with environmental changes that influence these. The method of defining obesity needs consideration. Body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, and skinfold thickness produce relatively comparable results when analyzing the interaction between obesity and asthma. 290 Prospective studies consistently support a link between obesity and reported wheezing or asthma diagnosis in children. However, there are still no clear explanations for such a link, and many different mechanisms may underlie the association. Obesity can be associated with symptoms commonly attributed to asthma, such as wheezing, dyspnea, and sleep apnea. Obese subjects are less fit and may have more frequent bouts of breathlessness on exertion accompanied by an exaggerated symptom perception. Some authors suggest that physicians should be cautious about diagnosing asthma in obese children on the basis of self-reported symptoms alone and should confirm the diagnosis by using objective measurements and evaluations of markers such as lung function parameters, bronchial hyper-reactivity, atopic sensitization, and indices of lung inflammation that can better identify asthma phenotype and exclude overdiagnosis. 291 It is unclear, however, whether obesity merely exacerbates the asthmatic symptoms, creates susceptibility to onset of asthma, or develops concurrently with the respiratory disease. Obesity could have potential biological effects on lung function and systematic inflammation while also sharing certain comorbidities and etiologies with asthma. 292 Atopic sensitization and bronchial hyperreactivity do not explain the observed associations. After puberty, the association between asthma and obesity tends to be stronger in girls than in boys. It is conceivable that severe obesity in adolescent females may aggravate asthma through mechanisms different from those linking prepubertal obesity to unremitting asthma in males. 293 Several single cross-sectional studies have reported an association between asthma and obesity, and in several longitudinal studies an increased incidence of asthma has also been reported in subjects who are overweight. Cross-sectional studies in the same population repeated after a period of time in the United Kingdom 294 and New Zealand 295 found that increases in prevalence of wheeze were not associated with concurrent increase in obesity. However, in the more recent New Zealand study, increasing BMI standard deviation score was significantly associated with current wheeze. 295 In a recent report of a cross-sectional study, increased BMI was found to influence asthma prevalence. 296 More recent studies have confirmed a relationship between obesity and asthma. In a very large study of Californian adolescents, an increased risk of asthma was observed for individuals as low as the 45th to 55th percentile of BMI, and the risk increased with increasing BMI. 101 In a large Italian study of children 6 to 7 years of age, high body weight independently increased the risk of asthma symptoms in children. 287 In a very large U.S. national study in children 13 to 17 years of age, obesity was positively associated with diagnosed asthma. 297 In a very large population-based survey of schoolchildren in southern Taiwan, higher BMI was associated with higher asthma incidence in both sexes. 298 In Kaohsiung, Taiwan, schoolchildren who were overweight or at risk of being overweight had an increased risk of respiratory symptoms and asthma. 288 In schoolchildren in Taipei, Taiwan, overweight increased the risk of respiratory symptoms, while habitual physical activity decreased the risk of respiratory symptoms. 289 For boys and girls, extremes of annual BMI growth rates increase the risk of asthma. 299,300 In southern California, being overweight is associated with an increased risk of new-onset asthma in boys and in nonallergic children. 301 There is a stronger association between obesity and asthma in females. In Tasmania, higher BMI in nonasthmatic young females at 7 years of age predicts risk of asthma developing in adult life. 302 The Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (Arizona) found that in females, becoming overweight or obese between 6 and 11 years of age increases the risk of developing new asthma symptoms and increased bronchial responsiveness during the early adolescent period. 303 A New Zealand longitudinal study found that 28% of asthma developing in women after 9 years of age was caused by overweight. 304 However in The Epidemiology of Asthma U.S. African-American youth, gender modified the association between BMI and asthma-related morbidity among adolescents with asthma, with effects found in males but not females. 305 The mechanism relating obesity to asthma is not clear. However, when it was found that in 11-to 19-year-old children in Tehran, Iran, asthma was significantly more frequent in both girls and boys with abdominal obesity, it was hypothesized that visceral fat may produce proinflammatory mediators that have been shown to cause subepithelial fibrosis and airway remodeling in animal models. 306, 307 In a national study in the United States, higher BMI and elevated serum CRP levels were associated with asthma of greater severity, requiring further exploration. 308 In a cross-sectional study of Mexican adolescents 11 to 24 years of age, the association between obesity and asthma seems to be greater among girls with early puberty, suggesting the role of female hormones. 309 As sleepdisordered breathing and obesity each are associated with asthma and wheeze, it has been suggested that the relationship between obesity and wheeze may be partly mediated by factors associated with sleep-disordered breathing. 310 In adolescents, obesity may complicate asthma management by interfering with the ability to accurately perceive symptoms for some patients. More remains to be learned about the role of sociodemographic factors underlying this relationship. 311",

A wide range of cross-sectional studies has been done on the relationship of antioxidants with asthma. Vitamin C, \u03b2 carotene, magnesium, and selenium were associated with a reduction in asthma prevalence 325-329 and may prevent or limit an inflammatory response in the airways by reducing reactive oxygen species and inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Flavonoids also may be potential antiallergic substances, 330 and a recent study on enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant systems in childhood asthma suggested that antioxidant defenses (e.g., glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) were lowered in asthmatic children. 331 However, not all studies on the role of antioxidants have been positive. A meta-analysis determined that dietary intake of antioxidants vitamins C and E and \u03b2 carotene does not significantly influence the risk of asthma. 332 The potential role of antioxidants as supplements has been explored 333 but a number of studies have been inconclusive. 334 Overall, supplementation studies have suggested a minor role for individual antioxidants in asthma prevention. 335 Several cross-sectional studies have indicated an inverse association between consumption of fruits and vegetables and symptoms of asthma, though the particular foods and symptoms varied. 336-341 However, a smaller study of Dutch children found no clear association between fruit and vegetable intake and asthma symptoms. 342 Ecological analysis of ISAAC Phase One data involving 53 countries found an inverse association between asthma symptoms and food of plant origin. 343 In ISAAC Phase Two, fruit intake was associated with a low prevalence of current wheeze, and in nonaffluent countries with cooked green vegetables. 314 The possible protective value of antioxidants is supported by an ecological study of exposure to paracetamol (which depletes the antioxidant glutathione), which was associated with an increase of asthma symptoms, 344 and subsequent ISAAC cross-sectional studies in younger and older children where paracetamol use was reported. 345,346 In a large cross-sectional study of youth (NHANES III), serum vitamin C and \u03b2 carotene but not vitamin E were inversely associated with asthma. 329 Interventions with antioxidants have not been shown to be effective, and further studies are needed in this area.",

In 1997, Black and Sharpe cited evidence that contradicted the antioxidant hypothesis, instead proposing that the increase in asthma prevalence may have stemmed from an increased consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and a decreased consumption of saturated fat. 350 The Omega-6 PUFAs may particularly have a role in regulating immune response and inflammation. These PUFAs are found largely as linoleic acid in foods such as margarine and vegetable oils, which have risen in consumption with Westernization. 351 Linoleic acid is a precursor of arachidonic acid that is converted into prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), which inhibits interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and promotes an inflammatory environment that favors asthma development. Meanwhile, Omega-3 PUFAs may have an anti-inflammatory role. Thus, the increase in Omega-6 PUFA consumption and the decrease in Omega-3 PUFA consumption may immunologically increase the susceptibility of the population, although PUFAs may have other immunosuppressive mechanisms that require further study. 352 Investigation of the lipid hypothesis found mixed results. A number of cross-sectional studies showed beneficial associations between foods containing Omega-3 PUFAs and asthma, 353 but studies on cord blood PUFA composition and development of atopic disease have been inconclusive. 354 There have been conflicting reports on the relationship between levels of PUFAs and wheeze. PUFA derived from vegetables in the ISAAC ecological analysis was associated with decreased symptom prevalence, 343 supporting the hypothesis that it is industrially-derived PUFA that is responsible, rather than naturally derived PUFA from vegetables. 322, 355 Disappointingly, intervention studies have not found consistent results nor provided sufficient support for dietary supplementation with PUFAs. 322, 352, [356] [357] [358] Trans Fatty Acids Trans fatty acids are found in industrially hydrogenated fats used in spreads, dairy products, and the fat of ruminant animals. These fatty acids may influence the desaturation and chain elongation of Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids into precursors of inflammatory mediators, such as leukotrienes. A European ISAAC investigation found a significantly positive association between trans fatty acids and the prevalence of childhood asthma, and the hypothesis that they may play a part in the development of childhood asthma seems worth pursuing. 359",

These show either no beneficial effect, 281,379-381 or a beneficial effect. 382-384 A 2004 cohort study showed exclusive breastfeeding for more than 4 months reduced the risk of asthma at the child's age of 4. 385 One study found an increased risk of asthma in those who were breast fed. 386 The lack of consistency of research findings makes it difficult to make any recommendations. Controversy about the interpretation of the evidence has been appraised. 387,388 More recently, several studies in affluent countries have found no clear association (positive or negative) from breast feeding, 389-391 even when the mother is asthmatic, 392,393 or small protective effects. 283, [394] [395] [396] In susceptible infants, the risk of developing allergic symptoms, but not the risk of sensitization, was modified by intake of Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids through breast milk. 397 Breast feeding has other child health benefits, and thus its encouragement until 4 to 6 months of age is recommended. To date, there is no evidence demonstrating that high-risk infants benefit from modulation of maternal diet during lactation. Currently no special diet for the lactating mother has been recommended. 254 In an analysis from ISAAC Phase Two, any breast feeding was associated with less wheeze in countries of all income levels. 398 However, when types of wheeze and income of country were explored, breastfeeding was associated only with non-atopic wheeze in low-and middleincome countries, and it showed no protective association for atopic wheeze in countries of all income levels. The lack of inclusion of nonaffluent countries in most breastfeeding studies to date may explain some of the conflicting evidence. To illustrate this, a study in India in children who live with close animal contact and mud flooring and who were exclusively breast fed were less likely to develop asthma than those who were not breast fed. 399",

In 2002, no advantages were found in a randomized controlled trial eliminating cow's milk and eggs in the last trimester. 401,402 Devereux and colleagues found that increased maternal intake of vitamin E was associated with decreased proliferation of cord blood mononuclear cells in response to allergens, suggesting a potential beneficial effect of maternal nutrition against atopy. 403 Two maternal antioxidant studies showed an inverse relationship of antioxidants vitamin E, vitamin C, and zinc with wheeze. 404, 405 The selenium status of a cohort of 2000 pregnant mothers was also inversely associated with wheezing in the child, 406 but this disappeared after the 5 years of age. One study of maternal PUFA intake found that maternal oily fish consumption during pregnancy was protective for childhood asthma, particularly in children who have asthmatic mothers. 407 In keeping with many other diet studies, however, a longitudinal study of maternal consumption of various food types found no association between fish intake and asthma outcomes in children, 408 despite another study suggesting an association. 409 There was also no association between asthma and maternal consumption of foods such as vegetables, egg, and dairy. In contrast to the more specific antioxidant and vitamin D studies, the effect of broader food groups on asthma outcomes seems less significant. 410 However a protective effect of a high level of adherence to a Mediterranean diet during pregnancy was found against asthma-like symptoms at 6 years of age. 411 There is an obvious need for more randomized controlled trials of interventions on maternal diet using nutrients and factors that have the potential to impact the intrauterine environment and fetal immune and lung development. 412",

ETS consists of mainstream smoke that has been inhaled and exhaled by the primary smoker and sidestream smoke that arises directly from a burning cigarette. It contains many agents that have pathologic effects on human tissues. 413 Children can be exposed to tobacco smoke before or after birth. It has been difficult to isolate the effects on asthma of intrauterine exposure per se, as postnatal exposure continues in many instances. Does prenatal ETS cause allergic sensitization? No correlation was found between cord blood IgE of newborns and an active smoking history of either mothers or fathers. 414,415 However, cord blood eosinophil counts were found to correlate with the urinary cotinine levels of mothers. 416 In the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (Arizona), maternal prenatal but not postnatal smoking was associated with current wheeze at 3 years of age only. 417 A recent Taiwanese study found that prenatal and household ETS exposure had significant adverse effects on respiratory health in Taiwanese children. 418 Passive exposure of pregnant women to ETS during the third trimester in a Greek study was positively associated with asthma-and allergy-related symptoms in their preschool-age children. 419 The effect of tobacco smoke on BHR and asthma, apart from lung size and lung function, has also been studied. In a large meta-analysis, the pooled odds ratio for maternal smoking on BHR was 1.29. 420 Four studies of circadian variation in peak expiratory flow found increased variation in children exposed to ETS. A clear effect of exposure to ETS on BHR in the general population has not been established. While the meta-analysis suggested a small but real increase in BHR in school-age children, limited evidence suggests greater variation in peak expiratory flow in children of smoking parents. 420 In 1998 Strachan and Cook undertook a systematic quantitative review of case-control and longitudinal studies investigating the effects of ETS on wheezing and asthma after the first year of life. Maternal smoking was associated with an increased incidence of wheezing illness up to 6 years of age (pooled odds ratio 1.31), but less strongly thereafter (1.13). The pooled odds ratio for asthma prevalence from 14 case-control studies was 1.37 if either parent smoked. Four studies suggested that parental smoking is more strongly associated with wheezing among \"non-atopic\" children. Indicators of disease severity, including symptom scores, attack frequency, medication use, hospital attendance, and life-threatening bronchospasm were, in general, positively related to household smoke exposure. The excess incidence of wheezing in smoking households appears to be largely in early wheezers with a relatively benign prognosis, but among children with established asthma, parental smoking is associated with more severe disease. These studies suggest that ETS is a cofactor provoking wheezing attacks, rather than causing the underlying asthmatic tendency. 421 In a cohort study of 6000 children, maternal smoking was found to be an additional risk factor for wheeze, primarily in low socioeconomic status groups. 422 Similarly, asthma severity in children whose mothers stopped smoking was found to decrease. 423 In a subsequent study investigating the effect of intrauterine and postnatal ETS exposure in high-risk infants in the first 3 years of life, ETS exposure increased the risk of wheezing in the first year of life, but it had little effect on the development of atopy. 424 In ISAAC Phase One, the picture that emerged for tobacco was mixed, with no association observed with country tobacco consumption. 425 However, there was generally a positive relationship between women smoking and asthma symptoms.",

However, it is reassuring that favorable health outcomes can be attained with reduced exposure. Community opinion may need to shift further in favor of protecting children and others from ETS before minimal interventions can be successful. This will require continued efforts by the medical and public health establishments, combined with legislation mandating tobacco-free public places and ETS-related media campaigns. 427 Is there evidence that stopping ETS exposure is beneficial? A recent U.S. study has demonstrated an association between ETS exposure reduction and fewer episodes of poor asthma control, respiratory-related emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. These findings emphasize the importance of ETS exposure reduction as a mechanism to improve asthma control and morbidity. 170 What about adolescents who take up smoking? Asthma and active cigarette smoking interact to cause more severe symptoms, decline in lung function, and impaired shortterm therapeutic response to corticosteroids. Clinical and public health programs should encourage asthmatics who smoke to quit. 428 However, in Latin America a recent study found that the prevalence of tobacco smoking in the last 12 months was 16%, with significant female predominance. More than 27% of asthma symptoms were attributable to active tobacco consumption, suggesting that potent and more effective campaigns against tobacco smoking should be implemented in developing countries, where active tobacco smoking is dramatically increasing in children. 429 Public health measures have been beneficial in Scotland where, after adoption of comprehensive",

Many children with asthma experience deterioration of their symptoms associated with increases in outdoor air pollution. 432 However, there is no evidence for increased air pollution contributing to increased prevalence of asthma. 433 In ISAAC Phase One, a weak inverse relationship was demonstrated between city-level air pollution with particulate matter \u226410 microns (PM 10 ) and symptoms of asthma, even after controlling for GNP, which has a strong inverse association with air pollution. 434 Metaanalyses of data from countries with multiple centers found by contrast a consistent pattern of weak positive associations. These generally weak associations were in line with existing ecological evidence on the association between particulate air pollution and asthma. This finding is not incompatible with the extensive evidence from individual-level studies that air pollution may aggravate existing asthma, since this may not have an important effect on prevalence. The effects of air pollution may be modulated by stress. In a prospective cohort study in southern California, children from stressful households were more susceptible to the effects of traffic-related pollution and in utero tobacco smoke on the development of asthma. 435 Short-term fluctuations in pollutant levels may have different effects from chronically high concentrations. Neither does it exclude a causal role for roadside exposure for which there is limited evidence. Thus there is little evidence that outdoor air pollution increases the risk for development of asthma and allergy.",

            "text": "To the contrary, studies in Germany found lower rates of the prevalence of asthma in the more polluted East Germany compared with West Germany. During 1989 to 1991, there was a lower prevalence of asthma in Leipzig (in the former East Germany) compared to Munich (in the former West Germany). 46,351 A study of children in Dresden, Germany, using the ISAAC Phase Two protocol 34 showed that benzene, NO 2 , and carbon monoxide were associated with increased prevalence of morning cough and bronchitis. However, IgE-sensitization, symptoms of IgE-mediated diseases, and BHR were not associated with these pollutants. 436 In a study in Swiss schoolchildren, there was no association between long-term exposure to air pollution and asthmatic and allergic symptoms. 437 On the other hand, a cohort study of children in Japan identified increasing prevalence of bronchitis, wheeze, and asthma with increasing indoor NO 2 exposure among girls, but not boys. Increased incidence of asthma was also identified among children living in areas with high outdoor NO 2 concentrations. 438 In Latin America, a high prevalence of asthma was found in heavily polluted S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, with symptom rates comparable to less polluted cities in Australia and New Zealand. 439 Accurately modeled urban air pollution in France was associated with some measures of childhood asthma. 440 Although the current U.S. standard for ozone is based on shortterm exposure, a recent cross-sectional study suggests that chronic (12-month) exposure to ozone and particles is related to asthma outcomes among children in metropolitan areas throughout the United States. 441 In South Durban, South Africa, increased lower respiratory symptoms (cough, wheezing, chest tightness or heaviness, and shortness of breath) were strongly and consistently associated with prior-day fluctuations in ambient levels of both SO 2 and PM 10 . 442 In western Morocco, air pollution was a determinant factor but is not the only factor increasing the risk of asthma in children; other factors (e.g., respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, genetics, and passive smoking) present a high-risk threat. 443 In a study in Puerto Rico, proximity to some air pollution sources was associated with increased risks of asthma attacks. 444 In Argentina, a relationship was found between higher exposure to photochemical pollutants and high prevalence or risk of asthma symptoms. 445 In southern California communities, respiratory health in children was adversely affected by local exposures to outdoor NO 2 or other freewayrelated pollutants. 446 Society is experiencing a transition from classical pollution dominated by SO 2 and particulates generated by coal and oil combustion (with the effects primarily on cough and bronchitis) to pollution mixtures dominated by traffic exhausts represented by NO 2 (with effects on wheeze). 447 Motor vehicle traffic has increased greatly during the last decades, and its role in the development of asthma has been investigated. Diesel exhaust may have a particularly strong influence. 448,449 A positive association between self-reported truck traffic in the street of residence and reported asthma symptoms in adolescents was observed in German cities. 450,451 There were similar findings in the Netherlands. 448 In Italy, exposure to exhaust from heavy vehicular traffic in metropolitan areas increased the occurrence of wheezing. 452 In Kenya, children from an urban area were exposed more frequently to motor vehicle fumes on the way to school than rural children, and this partially explained observed differences in prevalence. 59 In asthmatic children in the Netherlands, black smoke, particulates, and O 3 were associated with acute respiratory symptoms and medication use. 449 A study of children younger than 5 years of age in Birmingham, U.K., showed an increased risk of hospitalization for asthma for children living in areas with high traffic flow. 453 One study in Germany found no association with traffic pollution and BHR. 454 In Taiwan, long-term exposure to traffic-related outdoor air pollutants such as NOx, CO, and O 3 increased the risk of asthma in children. 455 Children experiencing the highest burden of emissions in Nicosia Cyprus seem to be at a higher risk of reporting asthmatic symptoms. 456 Higher self-reported exposure to truck traffic on the street of residence obtained as part of ISAAC Phase Three was associated with higher reports of asthma symptoms in many locations of the world. 457 In the United States, children 4 to 12 years of age with asthma were more likely to have symptoms with exposure to traffic-related fine particles. 458 However, in Oslo there were no associations of long-term traffic-related exposures with asthma onset or with current respiratory symptoms in children 9 to 10 years of age. 459 Traffic-related pollutants (e.g., NO 2 ) are associated with asthma without overt evidence of other atopic disorders among female children living in a medium-sized Canadian city. The effects were sensitive to the method of exposure estimation. More refined exposure models produced the most robust associations. 460 In Lima, Peru, the prevalence of asthma was significantly related to traffic flow density. 461 There is some new evidence that exposure to trafficrelated air pollution may cause asthma in children. In the Netherlands, the association between traffic-related air pollution and the development of asthma in a prospective birth cohort study with a unique 8-year follow-up was studied with PM 2.5 levels, NO 2 , and soot. Associations were stronger for children who had not moved since birth. 462 In a large Canadian study, there was a significantly increased risk of asthma diagnosis with increased early life exposure to CO, NO, NO 2 , PM 10 , SO 2 , and black carbon, and proximity to point sources. Trafficrelated pollutants were associated with the highest risks. These data support the hypothesis that early childhood exposure to air pollutants plays a role in development of asthma. 463 In children from participants in the Southern California prospective cohort, markers of traffic-related air pollution were associated with the onset of asthma. The risks observed suggest that air pollution exposure contributes to new-onset asthma. 464 In Cape Town, South Africa, community concern about asthma prompted an epidemiologic study of children living near a petrochemical refinery. The results supported the hypothesis of an increased prevalence of asthma symptoms among children in the area as a result of refinery emissions and provided a substantive basis for community concern. 465 In La Plata, Argentina, exposure to particulate matter and volatile organic compounds arising from petrochemical plants but not from high traffic density was associated with worse respiratory health in children. 466 In Leicester, U.K., a study examining the exposure to PM 10 at or near each child' home address found a dose-dependent inverse association between the carbon content of airway macrophages and lung function. 467",

Strachan proposed that allergic diseases could be \"prevented by infection in early childhood transmitted by unhygienic contact with older siblings or acquired prenatally from a mother infected by contact with her older children.

The clinical implications of these advances in our understanding of the etiology of atopic allergic disorders are currently limited.\" 470 A 1995 review of infants with wheeze suggested two groups: those who have lower-than-normal lung function shortly after birth, who will become symptom free during the preschool years, and those who persist with wheezing. 471 The factors that determine which group will be persistent wheezers are not well understood, but the potential role of rhinovirus is being explored. 471, 472 Because of limitations in the existing literature, a comprehensive review of asthma and respiratory infections cannot provide a clear answer to the central question of whether respiratory viral illness causes asthma, exacerbates underlying asthma, or both. 473 The more children an individual is exposed to at an early age, the less likely that child will have development of persistent or lateonset asthma, and the timing of this exposure matters; exposure to other children during the toddler years is more protective. More frequent respiratory tract illnesses may not be the only factor in this observed relationship. 474 A further analysis of the Tucson study showed that daycare during the first 6 months of age was protective against the development of asthma. Daycare during the first 6 months also increased the risk of frequent wheeze (more than 3 episodes in the previous year) at 2 years of age, but decreased the risk of frequent wheeze at 6 to 13 years of age. 475 The mechanism was thought to be exposure to infection.",

Conversely, repeated lower respiratory tract infections in the first 3 years was associated with increased risk of wheeze at 7 years of age. 477 Viral infections are the major precipitant of asthma exacerbations, leading to a complex of inflammatory processes. Although knowledge of the mechanism underlying infection-induced asthma exacerbations has increased substantially since the late 1990s, a great deal of further work is still clearly warranted.

            "text": "The Epidemiology of Asthma Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has warranted special consideration because it is the most common cause of bronchiolitis, an acute wheezy illness of infants. A study of children enrolled in the longitudinal cohort study, the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (Arizona) showed that RSV lower respiratory tract infections before 3 years of age were associated with an increased risk of infrequent wheeze and frequent wheeze at 6 years of age. Risk decreased with age and was not observable at 13 years of age. 479 RSV-positive children younger than 5 years of age with asthma had a longer duration of illness prior to hospital presentation than RSV-negative children but were not more likely to be admitted or to have a longer duration of ongoing symptoms. 180 The relationship between RSV lower respiratory tract infections in early childhood and asthma has been the subject of much debate. Some cohort studies have failed to identify a link between early RSV infection and atopic asthma. Cohort studies focusing on wheezing in early childhood have indicated that this is associated with an increased incidence of atopic asthma, but that this risk is not increased by RSV infection. Indeed, wheeze associated with rhino virus infection may be a better marker for possible asthma. In contrast, there is no increased risk of atopic disease in infants with RSV acute bronchiolitis. These studies confirm earlier suggestions that the phenotype of respiratory illness and hence the host response rather than the infecting organism is the best predictor of the future pattern of respiratory illness. 480 Rhinovirus infections are nearly universal in children with asthma during common cold seasons, likely because of a plethora of new strains appearing each season. Illnesses associated with viruses have greater duration and severity. Finally, atopic asthmatic children experienced more frequent and severe virus-induced illnesses. 481 Symptomatic rhinovirus infections are an important contributor to asthma exacerbations in children 2 to 17 years of age from a selected population in Atlanta. 482 A recent review has identified mechanisms by which rhino virus lower respiratory tract infection, particularly in a susceptible host, could promote the development of childhood asthma. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the link between rhinovirus wheezing in early childhood and subsequent asthma development. 483 A number of other infectious agents have been studied. Although a cross-sectional study in Finland showed a positive association between measles infection and asthma, 484 this finding has not been replicated. In an Italian population, a history of pertussis or pneumonia was not associated with asthma. 485 In a randomized double-blind controlled trial of pertussis vaccine in Sweden, there was a positive association between whooping cough disease and asthma by 2\u00bd years of age. 486 An increased incidence of asthma has been found in children with HIV1 on highly active antiretroviral therapy. This might be driven by immunoreconstitution of CD41 T cells. 487 In a prospective study in Germany, there was an inverse correlation between Chlamydia pneumoniae infection of the upper airways and the later development of asthma, suggesting that this organism may be a potentially protective factor. 488",

In a partly longitudinal study of children in Japan, an inverse relationship was found between tuberculin skin response and symptoms of asthma. However, it is unclear whether Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination, primary TB infection in childhood, or sensitization to harmless environmental mycobacteria were responsible 493 (BCG vaccination is discussed further in the Immunization section that follows).",

A large cross-sectional study in the United States found that DTP or measles vaccine appeared to increase the risk of asthma ever, but not wheezing in the last 12 months. 496 Other studies have found that immunization has no effect or even a protective effect on IgE-mediated disease. In a large prospective cohort study in the United Kingdom, there was no increased risk for wheezing illnesses in pertussis-vaccinated children. 497 In a randomized double-blind controlled trial of the pertussis vaccine in Sweden, the cumulative incidence of IgE-mediated disease was similar in the three vaccination and placebo groups. 486 In a large Canadian study, a negative association between delay in administration of the first dose of whole-cell DPT immunization in childhood and the development of asthma was found; the association was greater with delays in all of the first three doses. The mechanism for this phenomenon requires further research. 498 A U.K. study provided no evidence of an association between vaccination against pertussis in infancy and an increased risk of later wheeze or asthma, and it does not support claims that vaccination against pertussis might significantly increase the risk of childhood asthma. 499 American ecological data do not show associations between changes in childhood vaccine exposures and asthma prevalence. 500 A metaanalysis of observational studies did not support an association, provocative or protective, between receipt of the BCG or whole-cell pertussis vaccine and risk of asthma in childhood and adolescence. 501 However in a historical cohort in England, a potentially protective effect of neonatal BCG vaccination and asthma symptom prevalence was found. 502 Moreover a meta-analysis of BCG vaccine in early life supported the hypothesis that exposure to the BCG prevents asthma, possibly through a modulation of the immune maturation process. 503 An ecological analysis of the ISAAC Phase One data using immunization rates for the year of birth of the ISAAC participants, adjusted for GNP, undertook two levels of immunization analyses: country level and center level. The country-level analyses showed no associations between symptoms of asthma and national immunization rates for DTP, measles, and BCG. 504 The more powerful center-level analyses showed small inverse relationships between DTP and measles in the older age group only, with no associations with BCG. In view of earlier reports that immunization might be a risk factor for asthma, this mainly null result is reassuring for population immunization programs, given their importance for child health.",

One study from Africa found a significantly decreased development of IgE-sensitization in children in whose homes pigs were kept. 518 Bacterial endotoxin is known to induce production of Th1-associated cytokines, interferon \u03b3, and interleukin 12 and therefore has the potential to decrease allergen sensitization.

Early endotoxin exposure may be a protective factor against atopy but a risk factor for wheeze in high-risk children. 524 In a prospective study of children 10 years of age in Oslo, Norway, no risk modification was seen for endotoxin and b(1,3)-glucans. 269 In a recent study in the urban United States, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial exposures in the bed were associated with decreased asthma symptoms, but may act through different mechanisms to confer protection. It was proposed that endotoxin exposure in later childhood has independent protective effects on allergic disease. 525",

An increasing body of evidence suggests that indoor pollutants contribute to asthma morbidity, but the amount of research on indoor air pollution and asthma is small compared with outdoor pollutants. While a number of indoor ultrafine particle sources have been identified and thoroughly characterized, the potential health effects of these exposures remain largely unexplored. 526 Experimental and epidemiologic studies, however, suggest that pollutants, such as NO 2 and ozone, may potentiate the effect of allergen exposure in atopic individuals. 527 More detailed epidemiologic studies comprehensively evaluating indoor pollutants and allergen exposures are warranted. Characteristics of the housing itself may be relevant too. The relationships between housing type and asthma were explored in a New York study. Markers of housing deterioration, especially roaches, rats, and water leaks, were found in all types of housing and among residents with a wide range of socioeconomic levels, but residents of public housing had higher odds of current asthma than residents of private housing, after adjusting for individual disease risk factors and markers of housing quality. 528",

Cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies that have been conducted in children show a small increased risk of having asthma symptoms if the home has damp or mold. However the potential benefits of reducing mold in the home have not been investigated. In a study in the Netherlands, sensitization to HDM and possibly mold allergen is related to living in a damp home and childhood respiratory symptoms. 529 In a study of U.S. children, dampness in the home was common and a predictor of wheeze and asthma. 530 In a population study in Israel, viable molds were common but IgE-sensitization to molds was a poor predictor of development of allergic symptoms. However, allergy to molds in atopic subjects increases the risk of symptomatic allergic disease. 531 In a study in children in London, there was no significant difference in the degree of bronchospasm measured from children in homes with or without mold, but wheeze in the last year was associated with reported dampness and mold. 532 In a small study of children in southern California, the degree of atopy and reactivity to mold and pollens played a significant role in asthma severity in asthmatic children. 533 In a cohort study in Taiwan with assessment of exposure before the onset of asthma, exposure to molds had independent influence on the development of asthma. 534 In another Taiwanese study, visible mold on the walls was associated with seasonality of childhood asthma in Taiwan. 535 In a small study in Turkey, indoor molds had no effect on the symptoms of patients with asthma and/ or rhinitis monosensitized to molds. 536 However, simultaneous estimation of relative humidity in bedrooms and recordings of ambient temperature and humidity showed no association with respiratory symptoms. 537 Nevertheless, it seems prudent to reduce or avoid damp housing conditions. 254",

            "text": "The role of the farm environment and close human contact with animals in the development of asthma has captured a lot of interest. 538,539 Although the first report from Switzerland showed no protective effect, 275 the next crosssectional study of Finnish children showed that the childhood farm environment reduced the risk of asthma and wheezing. 276 Among Austrian children living in a rural area, children living on a farm had less asthma than those in a nonfarming environment. 277 In Bavaria, Germany, farmers' children had a lower prevalence of asthma and wheeze than their peers who did not live in an agricultural environment. 538 However, in a large cross-sectional study of Chinese children of a wide age range, pet keeping and parental atopy increased the risk of asthma in children. 540, 541 In a subsequent study of Austrian, German, and Swiss farmers' children, current wheeze was lower among children who spent time in the stables. This effect was stronger for children who spent time in the stables during the first year of life (OR 0.36 and 0.33, respectively) than for those who spent time there from 2 to 5 years of age (OR 0.73 and 0.87), compared with nonfarming children. Similar reductions were found with those who drank unpasteurized farm milk. Time spent in the stables and consumption of farm milk in the first year was independently associated with asthma outcome. Among farmers' children who spent time in the stables in the first year of life, drank farm milk, and whose mother spent time in the stables while pregnant, there was only one case of asthma (expected 19 cases). 515 These results suggest that exposure to the farming environment influences the development of asthma and IgE-sensitization in a potently protective way. A protective effect of the farm environment has since also been found in Finland, 276,542 four European centers and New Zealand in the ECRHS study, 543 Nepal, 544 Crete, 545 Canada, 546 and Australia, 547 but not in a further New Zealand study. 548 However in a cohort of rural Iowa children, a high prevalence of asthma health outcomes was found among children living on farms that raise swine and add antimicrobials to feed, despite lower rates of atopy and personal histories of allergy, suggesting the need for more population-based studies to further assess environmental and genetic determinants of asthma among farm children. 549 The relationship with animals is thus complex. For example, in a study in rural Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, although pet exposure was very frequent, the inverse relation between current dog contact and asthma was mostly explained by simultaneously occurring exposure to stable animals or was restricted to farm children. In addition, bias due to pet avoidance in asthmasusceptible families may contribute to the apparent protective effect of pets. 550",

Over half of U.S. households contain a source of NO 2 . 551 There are limitations in the studies because they often do not control for volatile organic compounds. 552 In addition NO 2 may aggravate respiratory symptoms in the presence of coexistent infection. 553 A study of children in Victoria, Australia, showed that NO 2 was a marginal risk factor for respiratory symptoms, with a dose response association present. Gas stove exposure was a significant risk factor, even after controlling for personal NO 2 exposure, suggesting an additional risk. No difference was noted between atopic and non-atopic children. 554 A study of asthmatics in Port Adelaide, Australia, demonstrated associations between personal NO 2 exposure measured by lapel sensors, and asthmatic symptoms such as chest tightness, breathlessness on exertion, and daytime and nighttime asthma attacks in children. 555 Higher indoor NO 2 concentrations were associated with increased asthma symptoms in preschool inner-city children. 556 In a study in the United States, exposure to indoor NO 2 at levels well below the Environmental Protection Agency outdoor standard (53 ppb) was associated with respiratory symptoms among children with asthma in multifamily housing. 551 In a study in Bavaria, Germany, coal or wood heating in children's homes reduced the risk of becoming sensitized to pollen and developing hay fever, BHR, and asthma. 557 Indoor exposure to mixtures and single components of volatile organic compounds can be related to asthma symptoms, but there is no evidence that increasing exposure of a population to these compounds initiates asthma and allergic disease. Although gasoline is a common volatile organic compound and can contaminate the indoor environment in motor vehicles and buildings, there is no evidence to link this to asthma. 558 Microbial volatile organic compounds and plasticizers (used in water-based paints and polyvinyl chloride) at school may be a risk factor for asthmatic symptoms in children. In Sweden recently, amounts of plastic material in dwellings have been found. Airborne microorganisms, volatile organic compounds of possible microbial origin, selected plasticizer compounds, and formaldehyde were found in school classrooms and outside the building. 559 Formaldehyde is one of several volatile organic compounds now commonly found indoors in homes in western environments. Sources are particle board, plywood, fiber board, paneling, urea formaldehyde foam insulation, and some carpets and furniture, as well as some household chemicals. Formaldehyde exposure may increase the risk of IgE-sensitization to common aeroallergens. 560 Frequent use of chemical-based products is associated with persistent wheezing in preschool children. 561 A significant positive association was found between formaldehyde exposure and childhood asthma. Given the largely cross-sectional nature of the studies underlying this meta-analysis, further well-designed prospective epidemiologic studies are needed. 562 In Kenya, the higher prevalence of asthma symptoms in urban than rural localities has been related to the home environment. 59 Urban homes tend to have different structures from rural homes, and carpets are exclusively found in the urban setting. Urban homes use gas and electricity as the major domestic fuel, and also use kerosene and charcoal, whereas rural homes use firewood as the major domestic fuel. In Germany, wood and coal heating and feather bedding were negatively associated with symptoms, whereas exposures such as truck traffic in a residential street and active smoking were positively associated with symptoms. 47 There has been recent interest in chlorinated swimming pools and asthma. An ecological analysis in Europe found that the prevalence of childhood asthma and the number of indoor chlorinated swimming pools in Europe were linked through associations that are geographically consistent and independent of climate, altitude, and socioeconomic status of the country. 563 A recent review suggested an association between childhood swimming and new-onset asthma, but exposure measurement needs attention. 564",

Most studies on the effects of climate have looked at short periods of variations in the occurrence or severity of symptoms. Little is known about the effect of longterm climatic conditions on the prevalence of asthma symptoms. Studies on the long-term effect of climate have been limited to comparisons of areas within countries. 565 A study in Bermuda related emergency department acute asthma visits with relative humidity, average daily temperature, and northeasterly winds. 566 In a comparative study in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, the prevalence of asthma among children was greater in the warmer regions. 567 In London, new episodes of asthma in The Epidemiology of Asthma adults during a 2-day thunderstorm were associated with a decrease in air temperature and an increase in grass pollen concentration. 162 A larger study in England of the effect of thunderstorms and airborne grass pollen over a 4-year period showed that thunderstorm-associated increases in hospital admissions for acute asthma were amplified after a run of high pollen counts. 163 An inverse association between the prevalence of BHR and altitude of the study area has been observed in mountaineering expeditions in Italy and Nepal. 568 As climate affects whole populations, ecological studies are ideally suited to examine the relationship between prevalence of diseases and climatic conditions between populations. In the worldwide ISAAC analyses few significant associations were seen. 569 However, in studies in two large continents with quite marked climate differences-Latin America 439 and Africa 570no relationship was observed for asthma symptoms prevalence with respect to latitude, altitude, humid/ dry climate or other geographical aspects, suggesting that meteorologic and geographic factors, individually, would not be able to explain the wide variability in the prevalence of asthma, rhinitis and eczema in the world. As the world becomes more affected by climate change there may be some regions such as western Europe where prevalence of disease is affected by potentially modifiable factors including humidity and temperature, 569 but at a global level our ecological analyses showed little effect.",

This hypothesis was explored in an ecological analysis of ISAAC Phase One data from 52 countries using Gross National Product (GNP) as a marker of economic development of countries. A weak positive association was found between GNP and symptoms of asthma; an increase of $10,000 per capita was associated with a 3% increase in the prevalence of wheeze. 571 However within Latin America, ISAAC suggested a reverse trend, with prevalence of symptoms of asthma tending to be higher in poorer areas. 439 Further supportive evidence of this association was found recently in ISAAC Phase Three, where data from 98 countries showed that the prevalence of asthma symptoms showed a positive relationship with Gross National Income (GNI), although the prevalence of severe symptoms correlated inversely with GNI. 32 However caution should be used in interpreting the findings because of the great inequalities in income distribution within almost all countries in developing regions of the world. GNP represents the total economic activity of the country, reflecting mean wealth rather than median wealth. Thus countries with a highly skewed income distribution caused by concentration of wealth in the hands of a small fraction of the population may have a relatively high per capita GNP, while the majority of citizens have a relatively low level of income. 572 A further consideration is that GNP does not measure factors that affect quality of life, such as the quality of the environment.",

In Auckland, New Zealand, there were higher lifetime and current prevalence rates of wheeze in children in lower socioeconomic status groups. 578 In Brazil, the prevalence of asthma increased with poorer sanitation and with higher infant mortality at birth and at survey year, Gini coefficient (as a measure of income inequality within the country) and external mortality, and in contrast, asthma prevalence decreased with higher illiteracy rates. 579 However, another study in Brazil found that the prevalence of asthma and related symptoms is quite variable and independent of socioeconomic status. 580 In Santiago, Chile, a higher maternal education level was associated with lower prevalence of wheeze in the last 12 months. 581 In Canada, disparities in asthma control between children from families of different socioeconomic status persist, even with adjustment for utilization of primary care services and use of controller medications. 582 In a nationally representative U.S. sample of children 3 years of age, asthma prevalence declined with increasing income for non-African-American but not African-American children. 108 Among New York children 4 to 13 years of age, children living in predominantly low socioeconomic status communities had a 70% greater risk of current asthma, independent of their own ethnicity and income level. Asthma prevalence within different ethnic and income groups was consistently lower in neighborhoods of greater socioeconomic status, except among Puerto Rican children, who had high asthma prevalence regardless of school attended or income. 109 In another study, U.S. non-Hispanic African-American children were at substantially higher risk of asthma than non-Hispanic white children only among the very poor. The influence of neighborhood environment on childhood asthma in a non-inner-city setting (Rochester, Minnesota) was small to modest. 583 The concentration of racial/ethnic differences only among the very poor suggests that patterns of social and environmental exposures must overshadow any hypothetical genetic risk. 584 The ecological economic analysis undertaken in the ISAAC Phase Three global study of asthma prevalence 32 revealed a significant trend toward a higher prevalence of current wheeze in centers in higher-income countries in both age groups, but this trend was reversed for the prevalence of severe symptoms among children with current wheeze, especially in the adolescents. Although asthma symptoms tended to be more prevalent in highincome countries, they appeared to be more severe in low-and middle-income countries. In a recent publication, Wilkinson and Pickett 585 describe the far-reaching effects of income inequality on indicators of societal health and well-being. The measure of income inequality used was the ratio of the income share of the richest 20% of country population to the poorest 20%. The effect of this measure is being examined in ISAAC Phase Three.",

Equally, while intermittent bronchospasm and mucus hypersecretion lead to acute exacerbations and much of the disease's early burden, asthma is now also being characterized by persistent inflammation and airway remodeling. As this chapter has noted, numerous environmental and genetic factors act in concert, resulting in a very heterogeneous condition in terms of age of onset, symptoms, severity, response to therapy, and course.

They found that wheeze was a very common experience such that one third of children had at least one episode before 3 years of age. Wheeze prevalence was 32% in the first year, 17% in the second year, and 12% in the third. Of those who wheezed before 3 years of age, 60% were wheeze-free at 6 years of age. The authors grouped children as \"never wheezed\" (52%), \"transient early wheezing\" (20%), \"persistent wheezing\" (14%), and \"late-onset wheezing\" (15%). Transient wheezers were more likely to have mothers who smoked, had evidence of early airway narrowing, and generally wheezed in association with viral infection. Persistent wheezers were more likely to have a family history of asthma, elevated IgE, and normal early airway caliber. In contrast, others subsequently found early airflow limitation at 4 weeks of age was associated with an increased risk of childhood airway responsiveness and wheeze. 588 The Tucson study reinforced the concept of different childhood asthma phenotypes, that many children \"grow out of\" asthma, and that the different phenotypes may be predictable based on risk factors. Other cohort studies have had similar findings. 589 Children in the Tucson study with persistent wheezing have significantly reduced lung function at 6 years of age. The authors believed that the poorer lung function was not congenital, but rather the result of persistent airway inflammation.",

Those with infrequent very mild symptoms at 7 years of age were often asymptomatic during adolescence, although some had ongoing mild symptoms later in adulthood.

Those characterized as persistent wheezers at 6 years of age had poorer lung function at both 6 and 16 years of age than the those who had never wheezed. However, again there was no evidence of progressive divergence between the groups during childhood. In contrast, a quarter of the children enrolled in the Childhood Asthma Management Program did have evidence of progressive deterioration in lung function independent of treatment arm over the 4-to 6-years follow-up. 591 Inflammatory markers were measured in a subset of participants. Those with evidence of progression had more prominent eosinophilic inflammation. 591 It is worth noting that several studies in adulthood asthma have demonstrated abnormal decline in lung function. 592 The Melbourne study also considered allergic features and found that the presence of atopy or allergic sensitization during childhood increased the risk of more severe asthma in adulthood. Other cohort studies have reinforced the roles of allergic sensitization, early environmental exposures, and early lung function deficits in the prediction of asthma persisting into adulthood. [592] [593] [594] At the same time as cohort studies began demonstrating early and persistent lung function abnormalities in children with asthma, pathology studies have demonstrated persistent airway inflammation and remodeling. 592 Airway remodeling refers to thickening of the reticular basement membrane (RBM), epithelial fragility, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of smooth muscle, deposition of extracellular matrix, and hypertrophy of mucus glands. These changes begin early. RBM thickening, absent at 12 months, is present by a median of 29 months in those with recurrent wheeze. 592, 595, 596 It is a consistent finding in children with severe or difficult asthma. It is not clear whether remodeling is reversible. These findings are of concern and lead to a different model for asthma with persistent and potentially progressive airway changes rather than simply reversible bronchospasm. Adding to this concern, the latest review of the Melbourne cohort reported that at 50 years of age, individuals who had been classified with severe asthma at 6 years of age had 37 times the risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with controls. 597 The risk was also elevated for those with original diagnoses of persistent asthma (OR 9) and intermittent asthma (OR 3) but was not elevated for those with mild viral-induced wheeze.

Observational studies are effective at generating hypotheses, however randomized controlled trials of environmental factors are required. The need for such evidence is even greater when one considers that the asthma epidemic experienced in the developed world is now affecting developing countries, with their very large populations and more limited health resources, as they become more urbanized.

While inhaled corticosteroids appear to have been highly beneficial, the potential role of pharmaceuticals in mortality epidemics provides a cautionary tale. Asthma continues to exert a very high burden on the child, family, and society, and in many populations existing therapies are not employed to optimal effect. This explains some of the disparity in burden seen between countries, ethnicities, and socioeconomic groups.
