            "text": "Rapid and accurate identification of potentially invasive taxa that may cause high economic losses or environmental damage is of critical importance. The onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman, ranks as one of the world's most destructive agricultural pests and commonly found in imported agricultural products and field samples, but is prone to undetected transport because of its minute size as well as cryptic behavior. Although traditional taxonomic methods are pretty useful in straightforward assignment of specimens to the genus Thrips, identification in the species level is much more difficult and requires expertise, knowledge, and experience. Furthermore, it is often difficult or impossible to identify or distinguish this species from other thrips by using material from other stages of development. Based on the foregoings, use of a molecular technique known as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as a rapid and robust alternative species diagnostic tool would be valuable. In this study, a relatively quick and simple method was used to detect the presence of onion thrips DNA rapidly and discriminate it from other species, by using material from different stages of development. Not only LAMP itself required less than 1 h to complete but also amounts of DNA as little as that recovered from a single specimen were adequate for the detection. Another advantage of this identification system is that nonspecialists will be able to make faster and cheaper identifications.",

This species is commonly found in imported agricultural products and field samples. There is no doubt that traditional detection procedure that utilizes morphological characteristics has been the gold standard method to identify thrips species such as onion thrips; however, morphological identification of a species is often difficult when there are some intraand interpopulation morphological variation of shape, color, or size among the individuals like those seen in onion thrips. Moreover, morphological identification requires expertise taxonomists and the method itself is extremely time-consuming. Furthermore, not only is it hard to identify species of thrips juveniles but also most of the taxonomic keys are limited to adult thrips, mainly because many of the morphological characteristics are not well-developed in the larval stages. This is especially problematic for quarantining protocols because crop infestations detected at ports of entry often include larval stage material. For these reasons, the development of a rapid and robust method for species identification that can be applied to material from any of the life stages is necessary.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP; Notomi et al. 2000) as a relatively new method could provide a valuable alternative molecular diagnostic tool. LAMP is a one-step process that amplifies a target DNA at a single temperature using specifically designed pairs of primers and a DNA polymerase. A total of eight distinct regions of the target DNA can be recognized using a set of six primers including forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (BIP) as inner primers, backward outer primer (B3) and forward outer primer (F3) as outer primers, and backward loop primer and forward loop primer as the loop primers. Annealing of the FIP initiates synthesis of the first-strand of the target sequence. Afterwards, the synthesized first strand was hybridized and displaced by the F3, which is a few bases shorter and lower in concentration than FIP. However, unlike the template, there is additional sequence corresponding to the FIP primer at the 5 0 end of the newly synthesized first strand. The formation of a loop structure was facilitated by a sequence of FIP primer, which is complementary to the F1 region of the target strand. This singlestranded DNA serves as template for BIP-initiated DNA synthesis and subsequent hybridization and displacement by B3 primer, which leads to creation of a final template with sequences that are complementary to F1 at one end and B1 at the other. Folding back and annealing of these complementary regions to the F1 and B1 regions of the target sequence results in formation of a dumbbell-shaped structure, which is quickly converted to a stem-looped DNA. This structure acts as a template for subsequent amplification (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, two additional loop primers (forward loop [LF] and backward loop [LB]) enhance the reaction efficiency of the LAMP procedure, thereby reducing the amplification time (Notomi et al. 2000 , Ravindran et al. 2012 .",

Reaction products stained with calcein were clearly detected using gel electrophoresis.

Furthermore, this method could discriminate onion thrips from another potentially infesting thrips species in <1 h. Using LAMP, we showed that onion thrips material was discriminated from material derived from another economically important pest species in the family Thripidae, i.e., the western flower thrips, F. occidentalis. Using the designed onion thrips primers, after a 30-min time interval, LAMP reaction products were clearly observed only when the onion thrips material was used as the template (Fig. 8) . Further checking at later time point (60 min) also confirmed that products were seen only in the onion thrips (not shown). Therefore, for species identification purposes, it will be suitable to obtain the results of the LAMP reactions within a 30-120-min time window.",

This identification approach could be used not only for the species presently studied but also, in the future, for other pest thrips species of agricultural, horticultural, and forestry interestand importance. This will, in turn, help in elucidation of the epidemiology of tospoviruses, their management, and serve as a potentially valuable tool in quarantine at ports of entry. Another merit of this approach is its requirement for relatively simple equipment for isothermal amplification and analysis of the target material. Our results also showed that by just grounding a single specimen, the sufficient amounts of material from the onion thrips to successfully LAMP detection was provided. Results of LAMP also can be observed using either gel electrophoresis or visual detection when calcein is incorporated. Lastly, a relatively short time is needed for completion of the entire process from the extraction of DNA to the detection of the presence of a particular species, so developing and using this technique for other species, especially pests of economic or quarantine importance, would be enormously precious in maintaining a pest-free status, especially in the areas subject to infestations of the quarantine pests where quick decisions about implementations of quarantine measures could be crucially important.",
