However, vitamin D3 is also a pre-hormone that is endogenously produced when skin is exposed to sufficient amounts of UV-B [3]. Vitamin D3 affects gene regulation after it is converted via hydroxylation at carbon 25 (providing 25-hydroxyvitamin D3) and at carbon 1 to 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), which is the high affinity ligand of the transcription factor vitamin D receptor (VDR) [4]. Thus, ligand-activated VDR binds to accessible genomic sites in the vicinity of its target genes and modulates their transcription [5].",

            "text": "Interestingly, a fully potent VDR protein evolved some 550 million years ago in a boneless vertebrate, i.e., at a time when there was no need for calcium homeostasis and bone formation [6,7,8]. VDR\u2019s first evolutionary function was the control of metabolism, in order to support the evolving immune system of ancestral vertebrates with energy [9]. Thus, VDR and its ligand first specialized in the modulation of innate and adaptive immunity, such as fighting against bacterial and viral infections [10,11] and preventing autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis [12,13], before they took on the additional task of regulating bone metabolism. Thus, vitamin D deficiency is causing an increase in bone disease, such as rickets [14], and it may also be one of the reasons for increased vulnerability, particularly in elderly persons, against viral infections, such as the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak [15].",

The latter are stretches of genomic DNA that bind one or several signal-responsive transcription factors [18]. Single enhancers have a dominant transcription factor binding site, while super-enhancers are formed by multiple single enhancers [19]. Genomic DNA is always embedded in chromatin, the major function of which is to control the access of transcription factors to enhancer and TSS regions [20,21]. Accordingly, the epigenome of a cell is represented by covalent and structural modifications of its chromatin [22]. For example, active chromatin is detected via acetylated histone H3 proteins at position lysine 27 (H3K27ac) [23], while tri-methylated histone H3 protein at position lysine 4 (H3K4me3) indicates active TSS regions [24].",

Interestingly, a number of attributes of the epigenome are vitamin D sensitive, such as the binding of transcription factors like VDR and pioneer factors, and the accessibility of chromatin and changes in histone modifications [4]. A VDR ChIP-seq meta-analysis indicated that there are on average more than 10,000 VDR binding loci per cell type [27]. However, only a few hundred of these sites are persistently occupied by VDR and some 2000 are bound transiently, while the majority of them are only found at later points in time [28]. Based on the chromatin model of vitamin D signaling [4], the looping of these VDR-bound enhancers to TSS regions modulates the activity of hundreds of vitamin D target genes in VDR expressing tissues. These vitamin D-induced shifts in the epigenome and transcriptome represent the molecular basis of vitamin D signaling [5]. ",

Using the IGV-browser [36] all VDR-bound enhancers 1 Mb up- and downstream of the genes\u2019 TSSs as well as the TSS regions themselves were first visually inspected for VDR binding, markers of active chromatin and accessible chromatin. Then, VDR classification [28] and statistically significant (p < 0.05) responsiveness to 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment of enhancers and TSS regions [28,29,35] was checked based on data provided by the respective publications. When the criteria for a super-enhancer were not fulfilled, i.e., three VDR binding sites within 20 kb, one of which needs to be a strong persistent or transient site and a continuous H3K27ac mark throughout its whole enhancer [33], the closest single enhancer to the TSS carrying a strong persistent or transient VDR site was selected. The epigenome profile of TSS regions was also inspected for statistically significant (p < 0.05) responsiveness to 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment. Where necessary, higher magnification was used in order to distinguish enhancers close to the TSS from direct TSS binding.",

The THP-1 dataset was filtered by the machine learning method self-organizing map (SOM) [28] or for the top 100 genes with respect to basal activity, FC or p-value [33], which provided 587 and 264 target genes, respectively (Figure 1). Similarly, in vitro treated, unfiltered PBMCs showed 933 target genes or 248 genes after filtering for the top 100 genes with respect to basal activity, FC or p-value. In vivo PBMCs reported 702 vitamin D target genes. A Venn diagram of these five gene lists highlighted the genes CD14 (CD14 molecule), DENND6B (DENN domain containing 6B) and FBP1 (fructose-bisphosphatase 1) as common targets. However, under the condition that only four of five datasets need to overlap, a further 31 genes were identified.",

This resulted in 15 genes: ACVRL1 (activin A receptor like type 1), CAMP (cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide), CD14, CD93 (CD93 molecule), CEBPB (CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta), FN1 (fibronectin 1), MAPK13 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 13), NINJ1 (ninjurin 1), LILRB4 (leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptor B4), LRRC25 (leucine rich repeat containing 25), SEMA6B (semaphorin 6B), SRGN (serglycin), THBD (thrombomodulin), THEMIS2 (thymocyte selection associated family member 2) and TREM1 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1) (Figure 1). Since immune and cancer cells share the property of rapid growth [37], they also overlap in their list of vitamin D target genes related to rapid cellular growth. Therefore, we had to carefully evaluate which proliferation-related gene to select. Thus, the MAPK13 gene was included, while the G0S2 (G0/G1 switch 2) gene was left out, since no publication has indicated that it has a direct link to immune cells.",

Interestingly, compared with the majority of the other genes, the distance of these enhancers to the TSS region is short (4 kb or less). The TSS regions of the genes ACVRL1, LRRC25 and SEMA6B are sensitive to 1,25(OH)2D3 but not those of CEBPB and MAPK13.",

With the exception of the genes FN1 and CEBPB, all other genes are primary vitamin D targets (Table 2). The curve of the expression time course of the genes CD14, CAMP, TREM1 and FN1 showed the steepest increase, which defined group 1. The genes LRRC25, THBD, MAPK13, THEMIS1, SEMA6B and LILRB present an intermediate response to 1,25(OH)2D3 and formed group 2. In contrast, the genes CD93, NINJ1, CEBPB, ACVRL1 and SRGN of group 3 do not show any significant increase after 4 h, i.e., a more or less horizontal curve. The members of group 1 are characterized by a low basal activity and high inducibility (Table 2). Interestingly, all four genes in this group are regulated by ligand-inducible enhancers (Table 1). In contrast, the genes in group 3 have mid to high basal activity but low inducibility and their enhancers are not vitamin D sensitive.

The glycoprotein CD14 shows highest expression in monocytes and macrophages. It is anchored via glycosylphosphatidylinositol on the surface of the plasma membrane and is also found in a secreted form (sCD14). CD14 acts as a co-receptor for the pattern recognition receptors TLR1-4, 6, 7 and 9 [41]. It delivers the pathogen-associated molecule lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is produced exclusively by gram-negative bacteria, to TLR4 resulting in pro-inflammatory responses [42]. The transmembrane glycoprotein TREM1, which is found in monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, is also heavily involved in TLR4 signaling, i.e., it promotes inflammation in response to bacterial infection [43]. TREM1 is already known as a vitamin D target gene [44]. Similarly, the gene encoding for the extracellular matrix protein FN1 has long been known as a vitamin D target [45]. The protein is secreted by a large variety of cell types, such as macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells. FN1 functions in cell adhesion and wound healing but also participates in LPS/TLR4 signaling, i.e., in the inflammatory responses [46]. Thus, the proteins encoded by the highly vitamin D-responsive genes of group 1 are all involved in acute responses to infection.",

The traditional role of THBD is to bind thrombin and turn its pro-coagulative action to anti-coagulative, i.e., reducing blood clots. However, THBD can also bind LPS and induces its binding to the complex of CD14 and TLR4, i.e., it prevents the pro-inflammatory consequences of NF-\u0138B signaling [48]. The THBD gene is known as a key vitamin D target both in monocytes [49] and in PBMCs [50]. LILRB4 is an inhibitory immuno-regulatory receptor that acts on antigen-presenting cells like dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes and microglia. It affects TNF production and bactericidal activity [51] as well as the modulation of the differentiation of regulatory T cells [52]. The LILRB4 gene is known as a vitamin D target gene in PBMCs [53]. The transmembrane protein SEMA6B belongs to a the semaphorin protein family, members of which have immune functions related to the control of cell movements and cell-cell communication [54]. Interestingly, the family member SEMA3B is known as a vitamin D target gene in bone [55]. The transmembrane protein LRRC25 is found in monocytes, dendritic cells, granulocytes and T lymphocytes. It acts as a negative regulator of the signaling pathways of NF-\u0138B [56] and interferon [57], i.e., it suppresses the production of inflammatory cytokines and modulates the response to viral infections. The latter is a long overlooked effect of vitamin D on the immune system [58,59] and a reason why vitamin D deficiency may lead to high vulnerability against viral infections in the elderly, but also in school children [15,60,61].",

The MAPK13 gene is expressed in a large variety of cell types and it has already been described as a vitamin D target in skeletal muscle [63]. The TLR signal transduction modulatory protein THEMIS2 is expressed in B lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells and regulates LPS-induced TNF production downstream of TLR4 [64]. Moreover, the protein is involved in the development of T lymphocytes and serves as a marker of monocytic differentiation [65]. Thus, the proteins encoded by the mid vitamin D responsive genes of group 2 are primarily involved in general responses to infection.",

            "text": "CD93 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed primarily in endothelial cells but also in granulocytes, monocytes, platelets and stem cells [66]. The protein is involved in several processes of innate immunity, such as adhesion, phagocytosis and inflammation [67]. In the context of the latter, CD93 may act as a plasma membrane receptor for DNA for delivery to endosomal TLR9. Moreover, CD93 boosts the inflammatory response of monocytes by increasing LPS recognition by TLR4. CD93 may have a protective role in autoimmune encephalomyelitis via the control of the severity of inflammation, apoptosis and bystander neuronal injury [68]. NINJ1 is a transmembrane protein expressed primarily in myeloid and endothelial cells [69] but it was first described in the peripheral nervous system inducing neurite extension. In the latter context, NINJ1 was found to be involved in the immune pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis [70]. NINJ1 functions in cell adhesion and inflammation, such as leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation in the endothelium. CEBPB is a transcription factor that plays diverse roles in inflammation, e.g., through T helper cell 17 (TH17)-dependent regulation of inflammation in models of multiple sclerosis [71]. The CEBPB gene has already been described as a vitamin D target in myeloid leukemia cells [72]. ACVRL1 is a transmembrane protein of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, which mediates the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 9- and BMP10-induced signaling that orchestrates the development of blood vessels [73]. This relates to the control of monocyte to macrophage differentiation [74]. SRGN is a secreted proteoglycan of endothelial cells, monocytes, mast cells and lymphocytes [75]. LPS up-regulates SRGN expression in macrophages, suggesting the protein plays a role of in storage and secretion of inflammatory mediators [76]. Thus, the proteins encoded by the low vitamin D responsive genes of group 3 are primarily involved in autoimmunity.",

Transcriptome group 2 (LILRB4, LRRC25, MAPK13, SEMA6B, THBD, THEMIS2) is characterized by intermediate responsiveness on the transcriptome and epigenome level. These genes encode for proteins having a general function in infection. Transcriptome group 3 (ACVRL1, CD93, CEBPB, NINJ1, SRGN) encodes preferentially for proteins related to autoimmunity. The genes are characterized by high basal activity and low inducibility. Correspondingly, the enhancers of the genes are not ligand responsive.
