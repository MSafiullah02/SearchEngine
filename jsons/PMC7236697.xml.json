In particular, we will need to leverage our knowledge of the microbiome when attempting to reduce the risk posed by infectious agents through use of targeted hygiene, and by fostering/balancing exposure to naturally diverse microbial communities. Interestingly, health-care providers have started shifting their own emphasis in this direction by promoting critical care microbiome research/applications that treat dysbiosis in intensive care patients, an ambitious but encouraging goal.3 Recently, a more pragmatic use of antibiotics for treatment/prevention of infectious diseases has also been suggested by Rook and coworkers.4\n",

This problem is exacerbated by the aging of the population as a whole, and the associated increase in percentage (now \u223c20%) of immunocompromised individuals living in the community. The latter are often cared for at home.7 Contrary to optimistic predictions made during the mid-20th century,8 infectious diseases have clearly not been eradicated. Rather, new infectious agents continue to emerge and/or reemerge globally. These have included emerging antibiotic-resistant pathogens [e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)]. It is hard to overstate the risk associated with the emergence of such multidrug-resistant pathogens. The government of the United Kingdom has referred to this issue as a \u201cpost-antibiotic apocalypse\u201d, which threatens to kill ten million people globally by 2050.9\n",

            "text": "There also currently is much concern about the rapid rise in allergies (especially asthma and food allergies) and other chronic inflammatory diseases (CID) in the population. The Hygiene Hypothesis proposed by Strachan10 postulated that a lower incidence of early childhood infection (predominantly in first-world countries) might explain the rapid rise of allergic diseases during the 20th century. As discussed in a 2016 review by Bloomfield et al.,11 our current understanding of host-microbiome interactions and immune dysfunction suggests that increases in CID are, instead, the combined result of lifestyle, nutrition, medical, and public health (hygiene and sanitation) changes. These changes are thought to have deprived humans of exposure to potentially beneficial microbial agents (described as Old Friends (OF)), particularly in early life.11 These OF microbes are not pathogenic, as argued by Strachan,10 but rather include non-harmful diverse microbial species that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract and our natural environment. While the identity of the most important OF microbes may not be clear, our attitudes towards such non-pathogenic microbes must change. Thus, the concept of age-appropriate and health-appropriate hygiene practices for home and everyday life has emerged.11 Such practices include age-appropriate vaccination and exposure to non-harmful microbes that beneficially prime the developing immune system.12\n,\n13 This strategy has the goal of balancing targeted hygiene with maintaining the natural diversity of the human and indoor microbiomes.",

More recently, it has been argued that the Hygiene Hypothesis is flawed, but despite this, broad acceptance of the theory had been encouraged by a phenomenon known as citation bias. Namely, it was found that publications supportive of the Hygiene Hypothesis were cited more often than non-supportive publications.14 We believe it is time to restore public understanding of hygiene, and specifically targeted hygiene, as a tool for preventing transmission of pathogens (breaking the chain of infection) and, consequently, transmission of infectious diseases.\n11 This is consistent with efforts of the infection control communities and public health agencies worldwide toward emphasizing the necessity of basic hygiene practices, at both the individual and community levels, for infection control. Most importantly, hygiene is now being seen as a key component of strategies intended to tackle the global problem of antibiotic resistance.15\n,\n16 It is hoped that, by reducing the level of infectious agent exposure, fewer people will need to seek antibiotic treatment \u02d7 thereby limiting the selective pressure for generating antibiotic-resistant genes (ARG) and the associated antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens.17, 18, 19\n",

Infectious agents have been found to survive on indoor environmental surfaces for extended periods of time, in many instances remaining for days to months at populations high enough to initiate infection of a new host. The duration of persistence is determined by the characteristics of the pathogen and of the surface itself, and other environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity and the organic matrix associated with the pathogens. The health implications of such persisting pathogen loads are dependent, to some extent, on the human infectious doses for the microbes, which can range from 1 to 10 infectious units for some hemorrhagic fever viruses23 (e.g., Ebola virus) to thousands of infectious units for Staphylococcus aureus.1\n",

The global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease COVID-19, emerging late in 2019, is a good example of the need for microbicidal agents to interrupt the cycle of infection. COVID-19 is primarily a lower respiratory syndrome, with some enteric and multisystem impacts, therefore SARS-CoV-2 is disseminated through the very same steps discussed above.

For instance, advertisements in the popular media have implied that, for maintaining health, all germs must be eradicated from our environments. Such an impractical approach has not accounted for the possible beneficial impact of non-pathogenic (OF) microorganisms comprising a naturally diverse vs. dysbiotic indoor microbiome. We still have much to learn about such beneficial OF microbes.

Similarly, perturbations in the microbiome within the gastrointestinal tract have been proposed to lead to inflammatory diseases.32 The human skin microbiome of healthy adults is relatively stable and resilient.33 However, there appears to be a much more highly diverse skin microbiome associated with isolated populations such as the Yanomami Amerindians of Venezuela, who have been devoid of contact with individuals from developed countries and to the hygiene practices of those countries.34 The comparative study of such isolated communities suggests that westernization and urbanization has led to a substantial reduction in exposure to the diversity of beneficial environmental microorganisms our ancestors likely were exposed to for millennia. Such exposure is thought to be essential for appropriate development of our immune systems and prevention of acquiring allergies.25 Susceptibility to disruption of the skin microbiome of individuals living in megacities has been reported by Kim et al.35 Air pollutants present in certain megacities may also impact the outdoor microbiome, though the potential impacts have yet to be elucidated. Impacts of pollutants on the pharyngeal microbiome are being investigated, and indicate alterations in taxonomic composition.36 The skin microbiomes were shown to be impacted by factors such as environment and socioeconomic status.

The first example of such a product, the probiotic-based cleaning hygiene system (PCHS)42 is now commercially available. PCHS is based on the use of non-pathogenic probiotic bacterial spores from the Bacillus genus, and has been evaluated in a hospital setting. It is claimed to allow non-pathogenic bacteria to outcompete pathogens, including antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) microbes.18\n,\n42 The mechanism of action is thought to include the inhibition of quorum-sensing molecules of certain pathogenic bacteria.17\n,\n18 Additional proposed mechanisms include competitive antagonism of pathogen growth,42 and production of antibacterial compounds such as bacteriocins.18 This cleaning system is not intended for use in surgical suites or other areas that need to be aseptic. While environmental microorganism-based cleaning systems are becoming available in the market, with few exceptions the efficacy of such systems have not been demonstrated with experimental rigor, appropriate field studies, or long term analysis of sustainability of any changes in the indoor microbiome and subsequent health outcomes in populations. An example of such a study might include the identification of the microbiome of a prototypic high-risk environment (bathroom, kitchen sink, etc.) prior to and after the application of a probiotic product. Future research should also be conducted to identify the best mix of probiotics; the appropriate or optimal delivery systems; the safety profiles/considerations; potential for causing or preventing infections; the potential impacts of age (particularly the benefit for young children, infants, newborns, as well as older children/adults); and the potential risks for the immunocompromised, aging, and malnourished populations.",

As discussed above, targeted hygiene focuses on high-risk activities and surfaces, and discourages use of broad-spectrum microbicides for lower-risk activities and surfaces. It is the responsibility of subject matter experts (infection control communities, public health agencies, environmental hygienists, and manufacturers of microbicides) to remain current on the advances being made in microbiome science and the impact of microbicides on these microbiomes. In particular, the impact of microbicidal use on natural microbial flora, including OF as well as pathogenic species, should be assessed. It is critical to restore the public understanding of the basic principles of good hygiene practices and the importance of the concept of targeted hygiene as a means of minimizing the dissemination of infectious agents. There is an educational component of this as well: in devising best practices for informing the public in both developed and developing countries, it will be wise to draw on field studies e.g.,\n43 from low- and middle- income countries. These have demonstrated the critical importance of hygiene education in addition to the use of appropriate and targeted microbicidal \u201ctools\u201d to achieve the desired goal of limiting infectious disease transmission. In explaining targeted hygiene to the public of developed countries with reference to common-touch surfaces such as those outlined in Fig. 4\n, there are a number of key questions to consider:1What are the key targets for microbicidal product use?2When is the right time and place to act?3Who is most at risk in home and community settings?4Which targeted hygiene interventions can be employed?\n",
