The present study was set up as an extensive literature review aimed at evaluating biological hazards associated with FoNAO with high water content. Data were extracted from 432 publications to identify the most critical FoNAO/pathogen combinations. The number and severity of outbreaks of disease provided the basis for a primary evaluation, and qualitative criteria relating to pathogen prevalence, food/pathogen interaction, and the production of FoNAO items were used for defining three priority groups. Highest priority levels worldwide were defined for leafy green vegetables contaminated with pathogenic E. coli. Salmonella on/in leafy greens and tomatoes were also most highly graded. While strawberries and raspberries infected with Norovirus were graded priority one within the EU, cantaloupe melon and tropical fruit contaminated with Salmonella were included in the priority one combinations for non-EU countries. Level two and level three priority groups differed for EU and non-EU countries, including lettuce/Norovirus, basil/Salmonella spp., semidried tomatoes/Hepatitis A virus, grated carrots/Yersinia pseudotuberculosis for EU and lettuce/Norovirus, spinach/pathogenic E.coli, cantaloupe melon/Listeria monocytogenes, and Hepatitis A virus combined with unpasteurized orange juice and green onion for non-EU countries, respectively. The study provides an extensive scientific database that will be instrumental in the conceptualization of specific measures for preventing and efficiently controlling outbreaks of disease linked to FoNAO.",

This is partly due to consumers' increased demands for fresh produce, and especially for ready-to-eat pre-cut vegetables and fruits. For implementing future activities for mitigating risks posed by pathogens in food of non-animal origin (FoNAO), we need to pin-point the microbiological hazards linked to food-borne disease implicating FoNAO. Thus, there is a need for identifying and characterizing the bacteria, viruses and parasites that may contaminate food of plant origin together with the identification of the food items concerned. In addition, data are required that allow thorough exposure assessment, considering for instance various subcategories of food and different groups of consumers.",

Basically, the individual commodities categorized by EFSA were assigned to either Lot 1 or Lot 2 according to the water content of the respective food item as it is most frequently consumed. Thus, dehydrated fruits and vegetables were allocated to Lot 1 because fruits are mostly consumed fresh and vegetables are more often reported as not dehydrated. -Other processed products\u2016 were addressed as a category either in Lot 1 or Lot2, depending on the water content of the primary food item they were made of. In addition to the categories defined by EFSA, where -fruits non specified\u2016 are given as category 1, it was necessary in the process of data extraction to set up the categories -other\u2016 and -1/other\u2016, which include vegetable items that are not specified and (collective) fruit and/or vegetable items that are not specified, respectively (see Table 1 ).",

Following quality checking of the full text publications, 150 articles were used for data extraction in Lot 1.

Table 17 in appendix A presents the results of search A3, comprising data relating to the growth characteristics of pathogenic bacteria and persistence of viruses on/in items of FoNAO under various experimental conditions (e.g. temperature, pH, various amendments) and exposure times. In cases where multiple treatments were addressed, only the most effective conditions within a specific study were extracted. Since data were mostly derived from inoculation studies, in most cases the initial inoculation dose is given together with the increase or decrease in colony forming units (cfu) numbers. Table 18 in appendix A contains data on the colonisation behaviour of pathogenic bacteria associated with FoNAO with high water content. Information was collected from studies that related to the attachment, biofilm formation and/or the internalisation of the bacteria. Specific information on colonisation is shown in the -details\u2016 column. For instance, biofilm formation has been described for pathogenic E.coli, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus on various items of FoNAO with high water content. In addition, internalisation into FoNAO with high water content has been reported in multiple studies for several Salmonella serovars and pathogenic E.coli.

The approach followed for evaluating the importance of FoNAO/pathogen combinations regarding food safety used a qualitative prioritisation scheme. Specifically, FoNAO/pathogen combinations were rated as highly critical (A), critical (B) or moderately critical (C) with respect to food safety regarding multiple aspects, including outbreaks of disease, production and processing procedures, hazard prevalence in the food commodity concerned, and food/pathogen interaction (see also Chapter 3.6). FoNAO/pathogen combinations that were rated as highly critical regarding at least three criteria (including outbreaks), were assigned highest priority. Combinations that showed two highly critical characteristics (with outbreaks being rated either highly critical or critical) were allocated to priority group 2. If a combination had one highly critical characteristic together with some other critical factor, priority level 3 was applied. Defining priority groups was preferred over a ranking of all food/pathogen combinations in a numeric order, because the information corresponding to the classification criteria was heterogeneous and varied for the various combinations.",
