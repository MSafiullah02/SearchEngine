            "text": "Rotaviruses, members of the family Reoviridae, are non-enveloped viruses and major etiologic agents of viral gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide (Parashar et al., 2003). These viruses are composed of a triple-layered protein capsid that surrounds the viral genome, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the viral capping enzyme. The outermost layer is composed by the glycoprotein VP7 that forms the smooth surface of the virus, and the spike protein VP4 that functions as the virus attachment protein (L\u00f3pez and Arias, 2006). Trypsin treatment of rotavirus is essential for virus cell entry, resulting in the specific cleavage of VP4 to yield the products VP8 and VP5 (Arias et al., 1996; Clark et al., 1981; Espejo et al., 1981; Estes et al., 1981; L\u00f3pez et al., 1985). It has been proposed that VP4 undergoes conformational changes during the entry process leading to conversion of the mature infectious rotavirus triple-layer particles (TLPs) into transcriptionally active double-layered particles (DLPs) that start transcribing the viral genome in the cytosolic compartment (Dormitzer et al., 2004; Trask et al., 2010; Yoder et al., 2009). However, a direct functional correlation of the proposed structural changes in VP4 with cellular factors that might trigger these changes has not been directly shown.",

Rotavirus strains RRV and SA11-4S presumably reach the cytoplasm from these organelles to continue their replication cycle and they are called early-penetrating (EP) viruses (Diaz-Salinas et al., 2014). However, most other rotavirus strains need to reach late endosomes (LEs) to infect MA104 cells (Table 1\n), and thus they have been termed late-penetrating (LP) rotaviruses (Diaz-Salinas et al., 2014).",

This action is carried out by specialized transporters, such as the mannose-6-phosphate receptors (M6PRs). Two M6PRs have been described as part of the M6PR-dependent sorting pathways, the 46-kDa cation-dependent CD-M6PR and the 300-kDa cation-independent M6PR (CI-M6PR) (Braulke and Bonifacino, 2009). Both types of M6PRs bind lysosomal enzymes but they can also selectively transport other cargoes, such as the insulin-like growth factor II and the transforming growth factor-\u03b21, among others (Ghosh et al., 2003). Moreover, M6PR-independent TGN-LE transporters have been reported, the most studied being the sorting pathway mediated by the receptor sortilin-1, which transports several non-enzymatic proteins such as prosaposin and the GM2 activator protein (GM2AP), as well as hydrolases like acid sphingomyelinase, and cathepsins D and H (Coutinho et al., 2012).",

Through an RNAi approach we found that the cell entry of LP rotaviruses was significantly decreased in MA104 cells transfected with siRNAs against these two transporters. We also show that the requirement of rotavirus infectivity for the activity of cathepsins is essentially a general trait for LP strains. Furthermore, we showed that acidic proteases are also important for the infection of LP rotaviruses in intestinal Caco-2 cells, suggesting that cathepsins are factors required for the infectivity of these viruses in different cell lines.",

To investigate if the decreased infectivity of LP rotaviruses was at the entry level, transcriptionally active double-layered particles (DLPs) of RRV or UK rotavirus strains were lipofected into MA104 cells previously transfected with siRNAs against either CI-M6PR or sortilin-1. As we and others authors have previously shown, lipofection of DLPs bypasses the virus cell entry process, since the actively transcribing particles are directly delivered in the cytoplasm (Bass et al., 1992; Diaz-Salinas et al., 2014; Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2010; Silva-Ayala et al., 2013).

This observation led us to investigate whether other LP-rotavirus strains (Wa, WI61, DS-1, and YM) need cathepsins for infection. For this, the infectivity of the indicated rotavirus strains was evaluated in cells treated with leupeptin, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of endo-lysosomal proteases, or with a specific inhibitor of cathepsin B (CA-074), or with Z-FF-FMK an inhibitor of cathepsin L (Fig. 2\n). Reovirus type 1 strain Lang (ReoT1L) was used as positive control, since it is well known it requires cathepsins during cell-entry (Ebert et al., 2002; Golden et al., 2004). The infectivity of this control virus, as well as that corresponding to the LP-rotavirus strains were significantly decreased in cells treated with all three inhibitors as compared to control, untreated cells (Fig. 2). Of interest, similarly to RRV, the infectivity of the EP-rotavirus SA11-4S was not affected. To confirm these observations, we silenced the expression of cathepsins B, L1, or S by RNAi (Fig. 3\nA) and the infectivity of the indicated viruses was evaluated (Fig. 3B\u2013D). Although the siRNAs employed only partially silenced the expression of cathepsins, the infectivity of the control virus ReoT1 and rotavirus UK, but not that of RRV, was significantly decreased under these conditions, as compared to cells transfected with an irrelevant siRNA, as previously reported (Diaz-Salinas et al., 2014). In contrast, the infectivity of all four LP-rotavirus strains tested (Wa, WI61, DS-1, and YM) was decreased by 30\u201375% under these conditions (Fig. 3B\u2013D). The infectivity of EP-rotavirus SA11-4S was not affected by the silencing of neither cathepsin B nor S (Fig. 3B and D, respectively). Interestingly, the infectivity of this rotavirus strain was increased by almost 30% when the expression of cathepsin L1 was silenced (Fig. 3C).",

For this, we evaluated rotavirus strains RRV and UK, as representatives of EP- and LP-rotaviruses. The infectivity of UK was not significantly affected when DLPs were used (Fig. 3E), suggesting that the decreased infectivity of mature virions observed in cells treated with these siRNAs (Fig. 3B\u2013D) was due to a blockage in the cell entry of this rotavirus strain. As expected, the infectivity of transfected RRV DLPs was not decreased; on the contrary, RRV DLP transfection in cells where the expression of either cathepsin B (Fig. 3E, RRV, black bar) or cathepsin S (Fig. 3E, RRV, gray bar) had been silenced, increased by about 30% as compared to control cells treated with an irrelevant siRNA. These results suggest that LP-rotaviruses require cathepsins during cell-entry into MA104 cells, and raise the question whether endo-lysosomal proteases could act as anti-viral factors for EP-rotaviruses, such as RRV.",

            "text": "Most research on rotavirus cell entry has been carried out in MA104 cells, which are derived from monkey kidney epithelium. Human intestinal Caco-2 cells have also been used to study some rotavirus-cell interactions (L\u00f3pez and Arias, 2006), but the vesicular traffic during rotavirus cell entry has not been characterized in this model cell line. It is known that the infectivity of the EP-rotavirus RRV in Caco-2 cells, as well as the LP-rotaviruses Wa and DS-1, depend on several ESCRT components (Silva-Ayala et al., 2013), suggesting that these rotavirus strains follow a vesicular traffic after their internalization by endocytosis. To investigate if cathepsins are necessary for rotavirus infection of Caco-2 cells, we evaluated the role of these cysteine-proteases on the infectivity of EP-rotaviruses (RRV and SA11-4S) and LP-rotaviruses (UK, Wa and YM) using a pharmacological approach (Fig. 4\n). ReoT1L was also used as positive control for these assays. As expected, the infectivity of ReoT1L in cells treated with leupeptin (Fig. 4A), as well as with cathepsin B and (Fig. 4B) cathepsin L (Fig. 4C) inhibitors was decreased by about 80%, 40%, and 90% respectively. The infectivity of the EP-rotaviruses RRV and SA11-4S was not affected by treatment with either of the protease inhibitors employed (Fig. 4A\u2013C), in contrast with LP-rotaviruses UK, Wa, and YM, the infectivity of which was decreased by 45%\u201365% in cells treated with the different endo-lysosomal protease inhibitors (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the infectivity of SA11-4S showed a significant increment of about 30% in cells treated with cathepsin B inhibitor (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that cathepsins are important cell factors for the infectivity of LP-rotaviruses in both MA104 and Caco-2 cells. Altogether, the data presented in this work strongly suggest that LP-rotaviruses require TGN-LE transporters and their cargoes, the cysteine-proteases cathepsins, to infect different cell lines.",

On the other hand, some rotavirus strains enter the cytoplasm from EEs, while most of them traffic to LEs before reaching the cytosol (Diaz-Salinas et al., 2014). The discovery of the need of CD-M6PR and cathepsins as important cell factors in the cell entry of the LP-rotavirus strain UK, and the close relationship between the endo-lysosomal acidic proteases and the CD-M6PR in the maintenance of a correct LE environment (Braulke and Bonifacino, 2009; Coutinho et al., 2012; Chia et al., 2013), encouraged us to investigate whether other TGN-LE transporters, such as CI-M6PR and sortilin-1 could be involved in the infectivity and cell entry of LP-rotaviruses. In this study we have demonstrated that these two transporters are indeed relevant cell factors for the entry of these rotavirus strains, in agreement with the previous observation that CD-M6PR and cathepsins are necessary for UK rotavirus infection in MA104 cells (Diaz-Salinas et al., 2014).",

In the present study, we identify CI-M6PR and sortilin-1 as novel cell factors necessary for the infectivity of most rotavirus strains. It would be interesting to investigate if, besides sortilin-1, the M6PR-independent sorting pathway conformed by the less characterized lysosomal integral membrane protein 2 (LIMP2) (Coutinho et al., 2012), could also be involved in rotavirus infection and/or in the replication of other viruses. We also report that cathepsins, the cargoes that are probably the cause for the requirement of the TGN-LE transporters, are not only needed for the cell-entry of the LP-rotavirus UK, as previously reported (Diaz-Salinas et al., 2014), but they are also required for the cell entry of LP-rotaviruses Wa, WI61, DS-1, and YM, suggesting that these proteases are a general requirement for the infectivity of these rotavirus strains. However, it remains to be determined if these acidic proteases act indirectly, or directly on the virus particle as shown for reovirus (Ebert et al., 2002; Golden et al., 2004). Considering that leupeptin treatment of MA104 and Caco-2 cells significantly decreased the infectivity of LP-rotaviruses (Figs. Figure 2A and Figure 4A), and that sortilin-1 also participates in targeting cathepsins D and H to endo-lysosomes (Canuel et al., 2008; Coutinho et al., 2012), it is possible than other proteases could be involved in the infectivity and cell entry of rotaviruses.",

This observation is supported by the increase in the infectivity of RRV DLPs lipofected in cells where the expression of either CI-M6PR (Fig. 1D, black bars), cathepsin B (Fig. 3E, black bar) or S (Fig. 3E, grey bar) was silenced. Furthermore, we also demonstrated through a pharmacological approach that, unlike EP-rotaviruses, cathepsins have a relevant role in LP-rotaviruses infection in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that these viruses could require them to get access into cells using a conserved mechanism between different cell lines. In this regard, it would be interesting to determine whether these cysteine-proteases could be required for the in vivo infection of LP-rotaviruses.",
