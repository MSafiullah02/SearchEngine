            "text": "Pathogens mostly emerge in densely human populated areas as did the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which had the potential to cause the first viral pandemic of the XXIst century (WHO, 2003, Jones et al., 2008). SARS-CoV most likely originated from bats through an intermediate species that could be the masked palm civet Paguma larvata (Viverridae) or another bridge-host, itself very probably contaminated by a SARS-like CoV from horseshoe bats (Song et al., 2005, Li et al., 2006, Cui et al., 2007). Several elements indicate that this bridge-host could presumably be a Carnivora as suggested by both detections in wild animals from markets or experimental infections (Guan et al., 2003, Van den Brand et al., 2008). Several other mammalian or avian species are susceptible to coronaviruses infection (displaying enteric, hepatic, neurological, or respiratory tropism), but little is known about their viral ecology and host interactions. Coronaviruses are members of the order Nidovirales which contains three families of single stranded positive RNA viruses: Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae and Roniviridae. Coronaviridae are divided in two subfamilies: Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. Because of serological and genotypic differences, coronaviruses were traditionally divided into three groups labeled group I, II and III (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2003, Gorbalenya et al., 2004). These three groups have recently been elevated at the genus level and named respectively Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus by the coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses, thus invalidating the \u201cCoronavirus\u201d genus name (http://talk.ictvonline.org/media/p/1230.aspx). As other Nidovirales, Coronaviridae such as SARS-CoV possess a mutation prone RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) associated with high genome mutability (Castro et al., 2005). Furthermore, they frequently recombine in vivo (Lai et al., 1985, Makino et al., 1986, Keck et al., 1987, Jia et al., 1995, Herrewegh et al., 1998, Lee and Jackwood, 2000, Stadler et al., 2003). This genetic variability confers to coronaviruses a high potential of evolution that allows them to sometimes overcome species barriers and host specificity (Baric et al., 1995, Baric et al., 1997) (Thackray and Holmes, 2004). From a more general viewpoint, these characteristics are known to account for the frequent involvement of RNA viruses in disease emergence (Domingo and Holland, 1997, Chomel, 1998, Daszak et al., 2000, Cleavel et al., 2001, Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005).",

            "text": "Until now, Asian SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV, from Betacoronavirus-b group \u2013 Fig. 1\nA) RNA has been detected in only one bat family: the Rhinolophidae Gray, 1825 (Table 2). Therefore, this monogeneric bat family is considered as the host at the origin of the deadly SARS-CoV outbreak (Lau et al., 2005). However, other bat families are involved in the maintenance and the diversification of a wide range of coronavirus species belonging to both Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera (i.e. Vespertillionidae, Phyllostomidae, Pteropodidae, Molossidae, and Hipposideridae families have been positively tested for coronavirus nucleic acid) (Chu et al., 2006, Tang et al., 2006, Dominguez et al., 2007, Carrington, 2008, Brandao et al., 2008, Tong et al., 2009, Pfefferle et al., 2009). Whether or not another bat family could be involved (in addition to Rhinolophidae) in the natural history of betacornaviruses would have been an interesting question but since the discovery of SARSr-CoV in wildlife, most of the attention and sampling efforts have been focusing on Rhinolophidae (Table 2). Several species from this family were shown to carry different SARSr-CoV such as SARSr Rhinolophidae Bat Coronavirus strain Rp3 in Rhinolophus pearsoni and SARSr Rhinolophidae Bat Coronavirus strain Rf1 in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in the Chinese provinces of Guangxi and Hubei, respectively (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005, Tang et al., 2006). The sampling pressure on both Rhinolophidae (1148 samples in 12 species \u2013 Table 2) and Vespertilionidae (900 samples in 17 species \u2013 Table 2) has induced an over representation of these families compared to others (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005, Tang et al., 2006). By contrast, Hipposideridae (206 samples in 6 species) were under-represented in previous studies (Poon et al., 2005, Woo et al., 2006). The higher northern distribution limit of Rhinolophidae (versus Hipposideridae) may partially explain the sampling bias in non-Southern Chinese provinces (Fig. 1B). This bias illustrates the need for testing other sympatric species for betacoronaviruses to study their natural history and emergence process.",

The biogeographical origin of the ancestors of SARSr-CoVs (from Betacoronavirus-b sub-group) is therefore far more extended than the epicentre of the human epidemic (Southern China). Understanding the biogeography of this group would be essential for assessing the risk for emergence of another SARS-CoV like agent. South-China and its Pearl River delta combined various ecological and anthropic factors that have led the SARS-CoV to emerge but the distribution of the viral clade at the origin of SARS-CoV is much wider than this region and many locations still remain to be investigated.",

More particularly, we focused on the ecology of the Betacoronavirus-b sub-group (Fig. 1A) by testing hypotheses on the origination of these viruses not only in Rhinolophidae but also in their sister taxa Hipposideridae. Considering that Hipposideridae might host a diverse community of coronaviruses comparable to that of Rhinolophidae because of their phylogenetic proximity and comparable diversity (Nunn et al., 2004, Simmons, 2007), it is very probable that the prevalence and diversity of coronaviruses hosted by this family has been underestimated because of biased sampling (Table 2 \u2013 Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005, Tang et al., 2006). We hypothesize also that some bat taxa could play a refuge role for betacoronaviruses and therefore constitute a source of infection for other species, consistently with the recent application of the theory of island biogeography (MacArthur and Wilson, 1967) to emerging pathogens (Reperant, 2010). This study is particularly focused on, but not restricted to, Betacoronavirus in Hipposideridae in South-East Asia (Table 1\n).",

Sampling locations were selected considering land cover and geological data as forests are known to enhance biodiversity (Harvey et al., 2006, Trisurat et al., 2010) and limestone hills harbour numerous caves. The rocky forest-covered hills surrounded by cultivated lowlands, considered as potential refuge areas, were particularly sought. Sampling sessions covered an area of approximately 800 km from North to South Thailand by 300 km from West to East. Dates and locations are described in Table 1 and Fig. 1B. Sites were sometimes sampled several times to confirm the results, to screen another population or species of bats or to assess a putative long-lasting infection of a given colony (Table 1). Samples were collected from 25 species of bats and were divided and preserved in two different media: (i) modified Minimum Essential Medium antibiotic supplemented (viral transportation medium) to preserve entire virus particles integrity and (ii) RNAlater (RNA preservation medium) to limit RNA degradation, both kept on ice before and immediately after collection (prior to liquid nitrogen conservation in the field). Each sample was immediately aliquoted into four tubes (including absolute backup) and kept at \u221280 \u00b0C before RNA extraction. Traceability was assured by assigning a unique number to each sample. Handling of animals was conducted in accordance with the American Society of Mammalogists Guidelines for the capture, Handling and Care of Mammals (Gannon and Sikes, 2007). Trapping sessions were performed using harp-traps, flip-nets and hand-nets. Bats were transferred to individual clean cotton bags immediately after being captured and kept in a dark, cool and quiet place for one to a few hours. Immediately after sample collection, bats were released where they were trapped. Particular attention was paid: (i) to avoid disturbance inside the cave and near the colony; (ii) to disinfect material and shoes between sampling sessions and study sites; and, (iii) to preserve the surroundings as first encountered.",

Then, 5 \u03bcl of RT products were used in 25 \u03bcl final volume PCR reaction targeting a 438 nucleotide fragment of the RdRp coding region. PCR primers were designed from the RdRp coding region by selecting a highly conserved region (nsp12) among all Coronavirinae sequences available from online public databases in August 2007. Assuming a higher mutation rate for the third codon position and according to the published sequence variations, degenerate primers were designed: BatCoV pol 15197 (forward primer: 5\u2032-GGTTGGGAYTAYCCWAARTGTGA-3\u2032) and BatCoV pol 15635 (reverse primer: 5\u2032-CCATCRTCMGAHARAATCATCATA-3\u2032), respectively at position 15197 to 15219 and 15635 to 15614 on Bat SARS-CoV Rf1 reference sequence (DQ412042). In order to increase both the sensitivity and the specificity of the detection, a third primer were designed and combined with the previous ones in a semi-nested PCR: BatCoV pol nested 15419 (forward nested primer: 5\u2032-GCNAATWSTGTNTTTAACAT-3\u2032), at the position 15419 to 15438 on the same reference sequence. The first PCR produced a fragment of 438 nucleotides and the semi-nested PCR confirmed the detection and enhanced significantly the detection limit of the semi-nested PCR by amplifying a 216 base pairs fragment from the first amplicon. Contaminations were avoided by observing strict lab procedures, carrying out at each step (mix, PCRI, PCRII) in a UV cabinet and using bleached plastic-ware. Manipulations included extraction negative controls at the beginning and at the end of each sample series as well as several PCR negative controls per run.

This method did not need any prior alignment because this step was performed during the cladogram diagnosis and therefore established the putative homology statements during the tree reconstruction. Poy was used under parsimony as the optimality criterion (Wagner algorithm), complemented with the tree bisection reconnection swapping algorithm (TBR), perturbation injection, ratcheting and fuse iterations steps (Nixon, 1999). These combined steps provided a reasonably fast and accurate way to better explore the tree space by escaping from local optima. Although RdRp is a conserved gene and the matrix included a great number of taxa, resampling taxa tests were used to evaluate whether this matrix was subjected to the long branch attraction phenomenon which could constitute a limitation of some phylogenetic reconstructions. This limitation could be particularly true in the case of high evolution rate and very limited number of taxa when combined with static homology approach of molecular characters. The over-representation of sub-groups by several similar sequences was avoided as it could artificially report changes on branches located between internal nodes, leading to the long branch attraction issue.",

However, as Torovirinae sequence can not be used to root the trees in this case, we used the results provided by a published study (Snijder et al., 2003), that used Torovirinae as root. This study, based on an amino acid matrix, inferred a Coronaviridae phylogeny, and verified the monophyly of Coronavirus and the basal branching of Gammacoronavirus clade. According to these conclusions, we chose an avian Coronavirus taxa to root our trees and therefore study the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera phylogeny.

Therefore, the combination of several fragments in a same analysis should be carefully thought and documented as mixing the information they provide can produce a blurred signal and therefore can lead to an inaccurate phylogeny. Here we focused on a fragment of the polymerase sequence only for phylogenetic reconstruction of coronaviruses because: (i) the key function of this protein involved in vertical transmission and consequently in viruses filiation is likely to regulate variation and provide a phylogenetic signal that reflects the filiation and, (ii) its relatively short length, genome position and associated transcription characteristics make it unlikely to be a putative recombination site.

Moreover, the biodiversity of these two mammalian families is surely higher than what has been currently described (S.J. Puechmaille, unpublished data), which in turn induces a potential greater coronavirus diversity than is currently described. In discordance to what has been reported to date and based on the phylogenetic proximity of these sister families, Hipposideridae might harbour an equal or richer diversity of coronaviruses (at least of the Betacoronavirus genus) compared to the Rhinolophidae. Furthermore, the fragmentation of the forested habitat, produced by human activities such as land use practices and agriculture, leads to the isolation of preserved biodiversity spots (surrounded by cultivated fields) that have the potential to maintain both host and viral populations, preserving by this way the footprints of the natural history of coronaviruses in wildlife.",

Accordingly, the separation between Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus is not significantly supported in the Bayesian phylogeny (posterior probablility value: 0.69 < 0.95). Several other nodes remained weakly supported by the data in each method. Moreover, the HKU4/HKU5/BtCoV 133 group significantly segregated in basal position of the Betacoronavirus in both reconstructions. Alphacoronavirus exhibited mainly nodes with low support in both methods of reconstruction despite comparable topologies. The Alphacoronavirus detected in this study, Ha AcoV R, rooted two alphacoronaviruses reported to infect bats in Bulgaria (Drexler et al., 2010). Concerning Betacoronavirus-b topology, most of the nodes were well supported. Our RdRp gene based phylogenetic reconstructions placed Hl BCoV-T as a sister taxon of an african Hipposideros\nBetacoronavirus-b (Fig. 1A and S1). These taxa formed together the sister group of all other betacoronaviruses-b, which comprised the monophyletic group of Rhinolophidae betacoronaviruses-b.

In contrast with other studies, the Hipposideridae family in our study was the most sampled family with five times more samples than those collected from Rhinolophidae. Only two sampling sites among 28 (site 17 for Hl BcoV-T and site 4 for Ha AcoV-R) explored with various sampling intensity, gave positive results. For some site, the low level of sampling might be insufficient to detect any Coronavirinae (Table 1). We cannot exclude that betacoronaviruses are hosted by others hipposiderid bat colonies and could circulate around Thailand or South-East Asia. Moreover, it is likely that other yet unknown betacoronaviruses circulate in Hipposideridae and even in other bat families around South-East Asia. An appropriate sampling would be able to test these hypotheses.",

            "text": "Chu and collaborators have repeatedly detected alphacoronaviruses in Miniopterus (Miniopteridae) colonies from Hong Kong. Positive detections in bat colonies were obtained over a period ranging from 3 months in a Miniopterus\npusillus colony to 6 months in a Miniopterus\nmagnater colony (Chu et al., 2006). These results, suggested that alphacoronaviruses were able to persist through time in bat colonies. Another study on Alphacoronavirus (and Betacoronavirus \u2013 SARSr-Rh-BatCoV \u2013) infected Rhinolophus sinicus bats modulated this conclusion. No significant persistence was observed in Rhinolophus sinicus bat colonies and the viral clearance was estimated between 2 weeks and 4 months (Lau et al., 2010). Moreover, the authors reported a significant loss of body weight in bats infected by Betacoronavirus (SARSr-CoVs) that was not observed in Alphacoronavirus infected bats. This loss of weight could be the sign of a loss of fitness associated with Betacoronavirus infection in Rhinolophus sinicus, without presuming that it would be a promoting factor or a consequence of Betacoronavirus infection. Even though: (i) Betacoronavirus persistence was not observed in Rhinolophus\nsinicus colonies and, (ii) the loss of body mass correlated with Betacoronavirus infection might reduce the fitness of Rhinolophus, we report here that a Betacoronavirus was persisting for 18 months in a Hipposideridae bat colony. This suggests that a Hipposideridae colony might be more tolerant to Betacoronavirus than Rhinolophidae over a long period of time or that Betacoronavirus of Rhinolophidae might have acquired virulence factor limiting long-lasting infection in this host. Further investigations are needed to confirm and describe this suspected difference. This Betacoronavirus detected so far in Hipposideros\nlarvatus in Tha\u00efland is restricted to a single cave. Thus, Betacoronavirus long-lasting infection in a bat colony might be a rare event. Although rare, long-lasting infection can promote cross-species transmission by the emergence of new properties in viral populations (Baric et al., 1999). Despite the coincidence of several promoting factors in study site 17 (the long-lasting infection \u2013 Table 1 \u2013, the sharing of the same small-sized cave by three bat species and the phylogenetic proximity of the two Hipposideros species) none of the other species were detected positive for Betacoronavirus\n(Hipposideros\narmiger and Taphozous\nlongimanus were negative \u2013 Table 1). Interestingly, we noted that the Taphozous\nlongimanus (negative) colony was roosting separately from the Hipposideros\nlarvatus (positive) cluster whereas the Hipposideros\narmiger (negative) colony occupied also another specific area of the cave. Similarly, in site 4 (Table 1) the Hipposideros\narmiger colony, infected by ACoV-Ha, was roosting separately from the other (negative) species. Again, this typical spatial segregation within a roosting site (e.g. cave) limits direct contacts between species and is suspected to account for a behavioral barrier to cross-species transmission in the wild, as previously described for Lentivirus and Felidae (Troyer et al., 2008, VandeWoude et al., 2010). Nevertheless, we mentioned these observations here but these mechanisms still remain to be precisely described in the complex relationship between Rhinolophoidea and betacoronaviruses.",

Species-barrier crossing has been reported occasionally for Betacoronavirus in Asian, European and African Rhinolophidae or Hipposideridae but more frequently in Miniopteridae (Chu et al., 2006, Tang et al., 2006, Tong et al., 2009, Drexler et al., 2010). Moreover, Miniopterus species exhibit an aggregative behaviour, and mixed species colonies are commonly observed as described in literature (Benda et al., 2003). Mixed species roosting, inducing direct contact between species and therefore promoting transmission, in synergy with viral persistence in a colony and the phylogenetic proximity of the hosts, is likely to promote cross species transmission of alphacoronaviruses. As a result, a non-specific host-virus association for Alphacoronavirus in Miniopterus follows the same model as what has been described for these bats and their ectoparasites (Bruyndonckx et al., 2009). The apparent higher frequency of cross-species transmission (or the absence of strict virus-host association) in Miniopteridae compared to Hipposideridae and Rhinolphidae might partially be explained by their different roosting behaviour.",

Adding new taxa would also improve the phylogeny by providing probable currently lacking information, within or around groups that are not yet well supported: (i) Betacoronavirus sub-groups relationships might be improved by looking for new taxa related to the group HKU9/Bat CoV Philippine Dilim (weak posterior probability: 0.59 and bootstrap value: 0.24 are reported for this node); (ii) Other sequences from new Betacoronavirus (or taxa from a new group) might help to clarify the relationship between Betacoronavirus,\nAlphacoronavirus and putative new groups as discordance is observed between phylogenies and none of the method provide significant support to the nodes that link Betacoronavirus and Alphacoronavirus (posterior probability: 0.69 and bootstrap values: 0.21; 0.06; 0.24).",

With the detection of Betacoronavirus in hipposiderids in Asia, this hypothesis, while still possible, becomes less necessary to explain phylogenetic and geographic patterns of Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae betacoronaviruses. The clustering of Betacoronavirus-b that correlates with the host phylogeny rather than with virus geolocalization suggests that the phylogenetic relationships between betacoronaviruses-b is mainly driven by the host phylogeny (Fig. 1 and S1). Accordingly, the phylogenetic relationships of the Hl BCoV detected here (from South-East Asia) with the SARSr-CoV (from Africa) and other betacoronaviruses support the following hypothesis. Betacoronaviruses-b ancestors, meaning SARSr-CoVs ancestors, could have been historically hosted by the common ancestor of the Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae and could have later evolved independently in the lineages leading towards Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae betacoronaviruses. This point of view is supported by the topology of Betacoronavirus clade that exhibits the monophyly of Rhinolophidae betacoronaviruses despite their broad geographic distribution (from Africa and central Europe to South-East Asia and Northern Australia \u2013 Fig. 1) and shows the close relationship of Hipposideridae betacoronaviruses. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that putative host switching between Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae betacoronaviruses (ancestors), eventually associated with ancient migration events, would still be detectable. More investigations are necessary to address these points and test corresponding hypotheses. As well, new investigations would be necessary to confirm this suggested predominant influence of the host phylogeny on Betacoronavirus-b clustering and whether other lineage would exist in Hipposideridae, as suggested by the report of a Betacoronavirus from Australia (C. Smith pers. com. \u2013 Fig. 1).",

The phylogenetic status of this host, Rhinonicteris\naurantia, is not well defined but this species is described as intermediary between Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae, while considered an Hipposideridae (Hand and Kirsch, 1998, Simmons, 2007, Armstrong, 2006; Armstrong com. pers.). Albeit this putative intermediary betacoronavirus group count a unique member to date and its associated posterior probability is weak, its phylogenetic position correlates with that of its host. Therefore, we are looking forward new investigations that would address these elements and screen betacoronaviruses in other Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae.",

Many factors have been suggested to explain the occurrence of emerging viruses in bats such as diversity (in term of species and ecology), ability to fly, immunology, physiology, seasonal migration and roosting behaviour (Dobson, 2005, Kunz and Fenton, 2005, Calisher et al., 2006). Another stated that population genetic structure correlates with viral richness (Turmelle and Olival, 2009). In the case of Betacoronavirus, the role of: (i) the fragmented biotope observed today (the Thai forest biotope has drastically reduced over the past decades, leading to the formation of species refuge areas promoting species interactions (Harvey et al., 2006, Trisurat et al., 2010)) and, (ii) the segregation behaviour and the mobility patterns of bats (metapopulations, migrations), should be investigated for their impact on the mosaic pattern of Betacoronavirus.",

Both an Alphacoronavirus and a Betacoronavirus (more precisely the sub-group b that includes SARS-CoV) were detected in Hipposideridae in South-East Asia (Thailand). In contrast to what is reported for Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae are able to host Betacoronavirus close to SARS-CoV over long periods of time, suggesting that they could be a source of virus for other species under specific circumstances. Moreover, the phylogeny of the RdRp, when compared to the biogeography, suggests that these two bat families may share an ancient relationship with independent lineage of Betacoronavirus. Consequently, and by contrast to what have been generally reported for coronaviruses, we suggest that the host phylogeny globally drive the pathogen clustering in the particular relationship between Betacoronavirus and Rhinolophoidea. As for other emerging viruses, interactions between wildlife refuges (whether considered in spatial or organic dimensions) and human populations, likely enhanced by fragmentation, changes, cultural behaviour and secular traditions, contribute to drive the species barrier crossing of coronaviruses to humans.",
