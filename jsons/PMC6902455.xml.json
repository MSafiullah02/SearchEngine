Timely diagnosis and prevention remain the most important strategies. Accordingly, understanding the epidemiology of AKI in lower and middle income (LMI) countries must be a key step in tackling this problem. Our aim therefore, was to describe the epidemiology of AKI in patients admitted to our South African multidisciplinary ICU, where there is currently a high prevalence of HIV and trauma-associated admissions. We sought to characterize the factors associated with the development of AKI, the effect of HIV on AKI as well as survival and to report on the 90-day renal function outcome of all who developed AKI.",

The hospital is government-funded and is located in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropole in South Africa where 1.15 million people live in an urban setting, 12.3% of whom live in informal shack dwellings and 36.6% of whom are unemployed. The balance of 450,000 people live in surrounding rural areas within a radius of 250 km [21]. Full time consultant supervision is provided by two intensivists and two nephrologists. The provision of dialysis is also government-funded and not restricted within the ICU or by HIV status. However, general prognosis and current resource limitations are taken into consideration prior to the admission of any patient to the ICU [22]. The modality of dialysis is chosen by the treating consultant based on clinical status with a preference for intermittent haemodialysis or sustained low efficiency daily dialysis (SLEDD) due to cost constraints. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is reserved for severely haemodynamically unstable patients and for those with raised intracranial pressure. Referring disciplines include medicine, trauma, general surgery, urology, neurosurgery, orthopaedics, obstetrics and gynaecology. Elective cardiology and cardio-thoracic surgery have their own dedicated ICU. Obstetrics also has their own high care although patients with advanced organ dysfunction are referred to our unit.",
