The implementation of 11 molecular assay testing in a rapidly evolving public health emergency can be hindered by resource 12 availability or technical constraints. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the applicability of 13 a pooled-sample testing protocol to screen large populations more rapidly and with limited 14 resources is discussed. A Bayesian inference analysis in which hierarchical testing stages can have 15 different sensitivities is implemented and benchmarked against early COVID-19 testing data. 16 Optimal pool size and increases in throughput and case detection are calculated as a function of 17 disease prevalence. Even for moderate losses in test sensitivity upon pooling, substantial increases 18 in testing throughput and detection efficiency are predicted, suggesting that sample pooling is a 19 viable avenue to circumvent current testing bottlenecks for COVID-19. 20 2 Emerging infectious diseases pose a global hazard to public health, as exemplified by the COVID- 22 19 pandemic. Key epidemiologic strategies for control of community spread include contact tracing, 23 case isolation, ring containment, and social distancing (1-7). The use of microbiological testing to 24 identify disease cases is a crucially important element of these strategies. Some countries, including 25 the US, experienced a shortage of kits needed for COVID-19 diagnosis, which resulted in the 26 imposition of restrictive criteria to manage the selection of patients for testing. Constraints in the 27 supply of kits had a particularly significant impact on testing of mildly symptomatic individuals, as 28 well as asymptomatic contacts of confirmed cases. For some facilities that have been overwhelmed 29 by demand for testing as the pandemic progressed, test throughput continues to be a limiting factor 30 (8-10). Strategies for screening more individuals with a reduced burden on resources are highly 31 desirable. Using a Bayesian formalism, a hierarchical testing protocol based on sample pooling is 32 discussed. Anticipated benefits include easing the demand of constrained resources and enabling 33 more efficient detection of a larger number of cases. 34 Molecular assays are the predominant testing method for viral and bacterial pathogens (11-14). 35 Specifically, nucleic acid detection assays typically employ real-time polymerase chain reaction 36 (RT-PCR) for DNA targets and reverse-transcription real-time PCR (rRT-PCT) for RNA targets 37 (15, 16) . The popularity of such testing platforms is due to 1) their high sensitivity and specificity, 38 2) the widespread access to sequencing and synthesis technologies for the identification of nucleic 39 acid target sequences and probes, and 3) the development of fast, user-friendly, and cost-effective 40 equipment. While nucleic acid assays have powered a revolution in diagnostics and delivery of care 41 for individual patients, their application in large-scale infectious disease surveillance is hampered 42 partly by low throughput at a population level. 43 The information content of a diagnostic test can be evaluated with a Bayesian probability formalism 44 in the context of an individual sample or for repeated sampling from the same patient (17-19) by 45 3 taking into account the probability of detecting a positive case (assay sensitivity, or identification 46 rate ) and the probability of a positive result from healthy samples (false positive rate ). 47 Bayesian inference requires the assessment of a \"prior\" probability to the presence of disease in a 48 sample, ( ), which is updated to a \"posterior\" probability given a positive or negative test result Besides testing throughput, it is informative to assess the increased ability to detect cases using a 93 pooled-sample vs individual-sample scheme, which can be accomplished by comparing the ratio of 94 detected to missed cases in each protocol. Importantly, resource constraints are incorporated into 95 this comparison by accounting for unscreened cases in the standard 1:1 scheme (Eq. S6-8). The 96 relative increase in the detection-to-miss ratio between the pooled and standard 1:1 schemes 97 exhibits even more significant gains than those observed for testing throughput (Fig. 1) . is examined with a set of 186 positive rRT-PCR diagnostic test results for COVID-19 (Fig. 2) , ",

These tools can be extended to the somewhat counterintuitive situation where a 53 diagnostic test is conducted on a sample pooled from multiple individuals. The motivation for 54 sample pooling is to screen multiple patients simultaneously and reduce the burden on testing 55 facilities working with limited resources. Pooling schemes have been developed since their 56 introduction in the 1940s for syphilis testing, and have been applied to screen for and estimate 57 prevalence rates of a variety of diseases (20-24). Here, a simple two-step hierarchical protocol first 58 introduced by Dorfman is considered: Samples from patients are collected and randomly pooled 59 into groups of individual samples each. Pooled samples are interrogated with the diagnostic test. 60 If pooled testing yields a negative result, no further testing is conducted. If pooled testing yields a 61 positive result, all patients in that pool are tested individually. 62 While statistical approaches have been focused on characterizing the performance of various 63 pooling schemes, not all of them include non-ideal test parameters (25). Moreover, testing 64 characteristics at the pooled-and individual-sample levels can be different. Here, the Bayesian 65 inference approach in Eq. 1.a-b is modified to include differences in the assay sensitivity and 66 overall probability of a positive result in pooled vs. individual tests (Eq. S1-2). Sensitivity loss is 67 included as a reduction in the identification rate of pooled-sample tests by a scaling factor . Due to 68 the exceptional specificities of nucleic acid assays, the false positive rate is assumed to patients divided into sample pools of size , the average number of tests is 73 the number of initial pooled tests plus the expected number of follow-up tests (Eq. S4). Throughput 74 increase is expressed as the effective number of individuals screened by each diagnostic test (Eq. 75 S5). The individual-and pooled-sample test characteristics determine the pool size that optimizes 76 screening throughput as a function of average disease prevalence in the tested population. 77 The advantages of pooled-sample screening are discussed in the context of the rapidly evolving 78 COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) (8, 26). A recent rRT-PCR 79 assay for COVID-19 reports an identification rate of 95% and no false positives after testing 310 80 samples including other respiratory pathogens (27). Given reported specificities of commercially-81 available respiratory panel assays (>99%), an estimated 1% false positive rate was included in the 82 model results reported here. A moderate reduction in the identification rate for a pooled sample 83 ( = 0.9) was assumed -this variable is discussed in detail below. Consistent with similar 84 implementations of Dorfman-type testing algorithms (28), substantial increases in testing 85 throughput are predicted for low disease prevalence rates ( ( ) \u22648%, Fig. 1), where throughput 86 more than doubles and optimal pool sizes are 4 \u2264 \u2264 12. At intermediate prevalence rates 0.1 \u2264 87 ( ) \u2264 0.2, the increase in throughput is moderate yet substantial (>30% increase in throughput) 88 and pool sizes are small ( = 3). For high prevalence rates, pooling yields no improvement 89(optimal pool size = 1). Average disease prevalence can be re-assessed as information is gained90    for the tested population to re-optimize pool size. Dynamic self-tuning is a feature of Bayesian 91 inference, a significant asset when a close feedback loop is desirable.92 5",

A pooled screening protocol would have detected 95.7-96.8% of these cases (178-180 out of 116 186). Further support for moderate sensitivity loss can be achieved by dividing the distribution of 117 values for the test-positive samples into three subpopulations.

Sensitivity cutoffs shown benefit of hierarchical pooled-sample testing protocols is the ability to screen a larger 124 portion of the population and detect more positive cases. The relative increase in case detection is125    given by the ratio of the number of cases detected in a pooled setting and the number of scaled by the loss in sensitivity, \u2022 . Loss in sensitivity also leads to more128    screened-yet-missed cases -even in the absence of pooling, diagnostic tests yield false negatives129    and increasing those odds should not be considered lightly. In the range of disease prevalence with 130 moderate to high increase in throughput and compared to individual testing of every patient, a = 131 0.9 sensitivity loss leads to a relatively low increase in posterior probability of disease after a 132 negative test outcome, ( |\u2212)(Fig. 3). While sensitivity losses decrease the ability to confidently133 screen healthy individuals, the threshold for this tradeoff depends on the situation where the 134 screening protocol is deployed. Effective risk communication to screened individuals is needed to 135 prevent an outsized sense of security after a negative pooled-test result -e.g.Probability of an individual being infected even though their pooled-sample test gave a 139 negative result, as a function of background disease prevalence and for different values is amenable to HIPAA regulations -in fact, pooling has been implemented by state 142 laboratories in the recent past (31)-and requires limited additional sample processing. Refining the 143 dependence of sensitivity loss with pool size and coupling to modeling strategies that in less useful in an inpatient clinical setting where the highest sensitivity is needed to 148 minimize risk of hospital transmission from non-isolated patients. As with any change in the 149 delivery of medical care, a discussion including community stakeholders is paramount. 150 In summary, a pooled testing strategy has the potential to enhance comprehensive surveillance of 151 SARS-CoV-2 particularly when test kits are in short supply. The benefits of surveillance are 152 greatest in the early phases of community spread. Thus, improving the capacity for high-throughput 153 testing has the highest impact when prevalence is low enough that pooled sampling is most 154 beneficial. The ratio of confirmed COVID-19 cases to tests performed varies by country, but it 155 appears that aggressive testing strategies yield a low enough prevalence to benefit from pooled-156 sample screening -e.g., South Korea's is 3% (8.3k/270k as of 3/16/2020) (32). While the 157 development of clinical prediction rules and non-testing screening are critical to any 158 epidemiological response, dealing with a novel disease for which data is still sparse and testing 159 capabilities are limited means that maximizing the impact of each individual test can benefit Valuable discussions with Dr. Kimberly Hanson and Dr. Lindsay T.

One must also consider the probability of a 267 positive result in a pooled sample. Assuming that every individual has a prior probability of being 268 infected equal to some background average ( ), the probability of a positive test result in a pool 269 of size is the probability of having a nonzero number of positive individual samples times the 270 pooled-test identification rate plus the probability of a completely-healthy sample pool yielding probability ( |+) from the pooled test with a positive outcome can be used as a 274 prior for the follow-up individual test Bayesian inference (Eq. S3.a-b). overall probability of an individual's test being positive includes the probability of 279 correctly identifying a positive sample ( |+) \u2022 plus the probability of a increase is expressed as a multiplicative factor representing how many individuals 286 were screened by the use of each diagnostic test (Eq. S5). vs. partial optimization. In a fully optimized scheme a pooled-sample's positive result triggers 290 a cascade of smaller-sized pools, minimizing the number of tests performed. However, an 291 intermediate improvement is chosen due to possible adverse outcomes of a lengthier process with 292 several pooling and Bayesian inference steps -e.g., possible delay of necessary care, estimate the ratio of detected-to-missed (including unscreened) cases for each protocol 297 with the following simplified analysis: 298 In the pooled scheme, the number of detected cases are the total number of screened individuals 299 with the disease \u2329 \u232a ( ) multiplied by the effective detection probability \u2022 , which 300 includes the sequential detection probability at the pooled stage and the follow-up individual stage. 301 The number of missed cases would thus be the difference between detected and total cases, 302 \u2329 \u232a ( ) 1 \u2212 \u2022 . The number of false positives is the number of individuals in all-303 healthy pools yielding a false positive and whose individual test is also a false positive -, the number of detected cases are the number of tested individuals with 309 the disease \u2329 \u232a ( ) times the detection efficiency of the individual test . )] .

A screening point must decide how to use limited resources (e.g., 320 4,000 available tests) to detect the maximum number of cases in a population at 5% risk. pooled-sample screening protocol vs. standard 1:1: testing. On average, a pooled-323 sample approach allows testing 10,000 individuals, detecting 406 cases while missing 94 and 324 yielding 18 false positives; conversely, a standard 1:1 approach would test 4,a much more pessimistic estimate for sensitivity loss, = 0.8 and no change in the 329 false positive rate ( = 0.01). For the same 5% prevalence in the population, the screening point 330 with access to 4,000 tests would screen 12,550 individuals (627 of which are infected) using a 331 pooling scheme (for these new parameters, optimal pool size is = 7). It would detect 246 and 332 miss 381. A 1:1 testing scheme would identify 140 cases, miss 60, and leave 427 untested. Not 333 surprisingly, the number of false negatives increases substantially in both scenarios due to the lower 334 starting point for the test's sensitivity. However, in a pooled scheme 381 infected individuals are 335 still at risk of spreading the disease in the community, while in the 1:1 scheme 487 infected 336 individuals remain at risk of further community spread. As mentioned in the main text, effective 337 risk communication is a critical component of any large-scale screening effort with imperfect tests. 338 Symptomatic individuals should be considered at increased risk even after a negative test result, and 339other diagnostic avenues could be used (e.g., chest CT).",
