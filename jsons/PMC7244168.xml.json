            "text": "The lives of both electrophysiologists and their patients have been upended by the spread of COVID-19 and subsequent lockdown of parts of the country, including the cancellation of elective medical procedures. While some organizations like the Heart Rhythm Society,1 the Latin American Heart Rhythm Society,2 and the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists3 have released guidance for determining how to proceed with cardiac procedures that cannot be delayed, the anticipated impact of this widespread cessation is of significant concern for two reasons. First, the delay may cause patients initially scheduled for elective procedures to progress to needing emergency ones and, second, when things finally do open up again, the workload of both electrophysiologists and other health care practitioners is expected to multiply as we seek to play catch-up, thus potentially further delaying or complicating procedures that have been scheduled for later this year in a kind of ripple effect.",

To this end, I recently contacted colleagues from countries affected by COVID-19 before the United States who are currently on their way to recovery. From our discussion, it seems that most are relying on large-scale testing for the virus of both patients and staff. The model largely being adopted consists of testing the patient before their elective procedure and proceeding with the operation if the test is negative. Despite that this model requires significant resources, it appears that it is the most successful approach available so far and will probably be adopted in most hospitals around the world for the foreseeable future.",

Still, since the crisis began, most of us have been able to conduct virtual visits and provide effective care in a way that many did not think was possible before the outbreak and it is likely that this will remain in effect to some degree.",
