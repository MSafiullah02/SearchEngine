More recently, due to the complex circulation of people around the world, many effects are enlarged, increasing the propagation of transmitted diseases. For instance, the cocirculation of interacting infections [5,6] is very frequent for transmitted diseases such as tuberculosis and AIDS; the reinfection effect [7] seems to become more relevant for some transmitted diseases such as tuberculosis and viral hepatitis for which patients acquire partial immunity.",

Two complementary approaches add trust to the traditional deterministic models based on population-wide random mixing, leading the models from population level to individual level: the network theory [8] and the stochastic dynamics strictly connected to percolation theory [9]. Recent results indicate that, for scenarios of cooperativity such as in interacting epidemics, hybrid first order transitions may occur on epidemic models in Erd\u00f3s-Renyi networks and on d-dimensional lattices with d\u22654 but do not occur on d=2 lattices [10,11]. For some other situations, such as a model for vertically and horizontally transmitted infection, a discontinuous phase transition may occur even for d=2 lattices [12].",

In this work, we analyze a stochastic discrete version [15,16] of a basic epidemiological model on a lattice with coordination number \u03b6 (\u03b6=2 and 4), called the SIRI model (susceptible, infected, recovered, infected) [17\u201319], considering the probability of changing the state of a site i depending on its neighborhood. The SIR model with recurrent infection is presented in [20], wherein an infected individual may, spontaneously, become recovered, that is, acquire a permanent immunization.

The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we introduce the stochastic SIRI model and its transition rate. In Secs. III and IV we present and discuss the results of the one-site and pair mean-field approximations for the particular cases of SIRI model, without endogenous reinfection (Sec. III) or without exogenous reinfection (Sec. IV). Finally, in Sec. V, we make a summary of our concluding remarks and perspectives. Among the perspectives, we call the attention to the effect of topology network on discontinuous phase transitions observed when the SIRI model describes social contagions (\u03c3>1) [17], mimicking a cooperative behavior analogous to coinfections in the SIR model.",
