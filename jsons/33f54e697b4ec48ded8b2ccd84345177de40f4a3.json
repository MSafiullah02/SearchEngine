The tool was developed by Thrive Health, a company which has been working to improve the delivery of e-health in Canada since 2016, with an emphasis on well-being. This review captures this company's purpose and role in addressing the needs of patients and healthcare providers in the community, to change the definition of healthcare. In pursuing this goal, Thrive Health is innovating to make the long lost connection between physical and mental health through an online app with design features supported by research around subjective well-being, as a measurement of effective community development and human progress. This very characteristic is what establishes the company's uniqueness among other similar patient advocacy groups, and connects patient advocacy to happiness and well-being.",

Testing was not immediately available for all; yet people wanted to know whether or not they had been infected. This fear disrupted the work of care clinics and hospitals, as they rushed to serve people in need of urgent care and were also faced with those who demanded testing. While people cannot be blamed for their illness anxiety, the burden they pose has consequences.",

Updated with the most recent guidelines as they have become available, the tool asks six simple questions about symptoms, recent travel history, as well as close contacts. Based on the answers, it advises when to call 911 and take emergency care, when to call 811 to speak to a nurse for further testing and instructions, when to isolate at home, or when to selfmonitor. The tool, used by millions within a few short weeks, has served to calm anxieties and reduce the burden on call centres, clinics and hospitals. The app was developed and deployed within days of the COVID-19 pandemic by a new company called Thrive Health.",

Despite different lifestyle and professions -David is a software entrepreneur and James, a cardiothoracic anesthesiologistthey have shared the overwhelming experience of seeking healthcare, along with most of today's adult population. Their experiences have included: frustrations of misdiagnosis, details getting lost with specialist care, jumping from one doctor to the other without the necessary information being shared, lack of timely interventions and updates about their health status. Taking these frustrations as fodder, David and James were inspired to use their combined expertise to build a system that would address existing issues in healthcare systems and bridge certain gaps in diagnosis, treatment and recovery. The result is a smart patient advocacy system, a new company and digital tool, called Thrive Health.",

By creating an effective method of organizing care records, Thrive Health enables users to track trends in ways that make sense to them, and track changes in their diagnosis, treatment and recovery plans and processes. Servicing approximately 15,000 patients in clinics in Ontario and BC, including Saint Paul's Hospital and BC Children's Hospital, Thrive Health focuses on visibility and sharing of data, in the interest of more informed choices by patients and care providers alike. The app helps people through their health journey by focusing on two stages of a medical problem: preparation (for surgery, labour, etc.) and follow up (the recovery process).",

John Helliwell, a respected authority in the field of subjective well-being, is Professor Emeritus of Economics at the University of British Columbia, and also editor of the World Happiness Report, Senior Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR), and Co-Director of the CIFAR Programme on Social Interactions, Identity, and Well-being. Specifically, Helliwell's research positioning subjective well-being as a measurement of effective community development and human progress is a major inspiration behind Thrive Health. This inspiration gives Thrive Health the promise of finding meaningful ways to connect the treatment of physical and mental health. Seminal research by House et al. (1988) and many more has shown that depression, loneliness, a lack of social connections, and other mental health conditions can have unacknowledged, serious negative effects on physical healthreducing immunity and longevity, among other risks. At Thrive Health, the challenge that the company takes most seriously is to connect physical and mental health status throughout the health care journey, and to open up this discussion between patients and their health care providers.",

Patient advocates are clearly part of the solution. One of the most important factors in effective patient advocacy is the recognition that patients themselves have the \"greatest vested interest\" in their own health; and with this interest should come influence. Patient engagement could be considered a required skill set for patient advocates to ensure better outcomes for patients. It is of great importance for patients and their families to actively participate in their care as it will lead to a higher level of patient satisfaction (Chang 2017) .",

At Thrive Health, by contrast, this connection is a two-way street for health care practitioners and patients alike. If mental health is neglected, deteriorating mental health can impede physical healing; at the same time, the health care journey itself can have profound impacts on mental health. Recent research published by the Canadian Mental Health Association (2019) found that: \"People living with mental illnesses experience a range of physical symptoms that result both from the illness itself and as a consequence of treatment. These people are also at higher risk of experiencing a wide range of physical conditions.\" Recognizing the links between mind and body is the first step toward strategies to improve patient outcomes. Thrive Health attempts to bridge this existing divide by measuring well-being as a key factor in patient resilience, and integrating such information with the delivery of healthcare. In specifically designed questions, the app uses standard well-being questions, involving subjective well-being, as metrics to get a \"Thriving Score\" for each patient.",

Scores of studies show that our levels of happiness versus stress and depression can influence cardiovascular health, immune system strength, and our ability to heal from injuries (Diener et al. 2017) . One important figure in this research from which Thrive Health derives new inspiration is Ed Diener, Professor of Psychology at the University of Virginia and the University of Utah, and a Senior Scientist for Gallup. Alongside him is Dr. Carol Diener, who has dedicated her own research to identifying factors that predict subjective well-being. The Enhance programme is a 12-week interactive course that delivers daily exercises to help patients form healthy habits and make better lifestyle choices. As Thrive seeks to highlight connections between mental and physical health, Enhance is a tool with which patients can work toward happiness and wellbeing as an integral part of recovery from illness and injury.",
