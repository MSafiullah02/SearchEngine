Collaborative business processes are required being moved across factories and enterprises to effectively manage and ease the life cycle of production and its demands [8, 9].

There however exist challenges in predictive maintenance; the complexity and the capacity to manage big data with the nature of being dynamic and complex associations, and the flexibility and interoperability to integrate different systems/components [2, 5, 9]. Several conceptual frameworks for predictive maintenance have been proposed in the research community [11\u201314]. However, key factors such as modular design i.e. to act easily and dynamically based on needs, advanced analytics and middleware capability based on the context of Industry 4.0 standards, are still overlooked. In order to achieve a flexible predictive maintenance with an optimal maintenance decision making, a new approach should be in place to support the integration of different components, multiple data sources from different data domains as well as advanced analytics capabilities in a modular fashion.",

However, these approaches face challenges; computational complexity and storage with HMM, memory problems with RNN [17, 18]. Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM), a type of RNN, overcomes the memory problems by controlling information flow using gates (input, forget and output) [19]. Due to the nature of sequential sensor data, LSTM is suitable for data driven predictive models for machine condition and RUL. The approach for learning LSTM model in this work is presented in Fig. 2.

            "text": "In the context of flexible manufacturing in this case, data are collected from different machines and tools via sensor as well as other information systems like ERP, MES, etc. Also, the manufacturing industries work beyond their boundary i.e. collaborative partners, suppliers, etc., and the nature of dynamic data can be extremely frequent and highly voluminous in the context of modern factory [1, 2, 5]. Thus, it is essential to use a consistent but extensible model to allow for a flexible predictive maintenance in manufacturing. FIWARE offers a data model based on an entity-attribute model, the entities are used to represent and model real world objects including virtual entities, the attributes that describe different aspects of the entity as well as supporting open standards and extensibility [15]. In this aspect, FIWARE model meets the requirements of flexible predictive maintenance platform, thus it is adopted for the application case as presented in Fig. 4.\n",

Also, collaborative data are moved/accessed; machine base data from manufacturer, product design data from partner as well as machine status/diagnosis required to the insurer for purposes e.g. claim analysis. The application of IDS connector along with the proposed data model facilitates greater interoperability as well as greater transparency of data access due to the policy and usage controls of the IDS connector in a collaborative context. Ultimately, it will facilitate virtual factory production mode which requires a higher level of integration of data from customers, suppliers and partners across enterprises, enabling the optimization of the information flow and delivery process for smart plant information systems.",

The proposed solution currently focuses on predictive maintenance in the manner that maintenance activity can be carried out before a potential failure or a degradation of a machine/equipment is detected. On the other hand, without the process of optimal maintenance schedule plan for the existing complex machines/equipment within the production chain, it is not easy to manage effective maintenance. In this regard, optimal maintenance schedule plan considering complex systems, cost, etc., in the context of Industry 4.0, will be hugely significant for future work.",

Predictive maintenance in industry collaborations in the complex and dynamic manufacturing environment requires a concrete, extensible architecture and platform. Unlike the 5-level approach, the proposed predictive maintenance platform offers flexible and modular system with advanced capabilities to handle the requirements of Industry 4.0 and advanced analytics e.g. LSTM models (machine condition, RUL). The effectiveness of the proposed solution is demonstrated within a flexible manufacturing case. Using predictive maintenance analytics, the maintenance task can be performed in an efficient manner to avoid unnecessary downtime, to keep low cost and to provide better management of the condition and process of expensive manufacturing equipment and optimization of the whole production chain. Regarding future work, we plan to do the implementation and evaluation of the design platform including predictive models, with the described application case and further use cases across industries as well as the development of optimal predictive maintenance schedule plan considering complex systems of Industry 4.0.",
