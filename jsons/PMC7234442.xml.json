We suspect this pattern results from a combination of telehealth policy constraints (e.g., limited reimbursement) and neglect on the part of clinicians and hospitals. Nevertheless, legal and moral imperatives compel hospitals to apply best practices regarding accessibility for virtual services. Hospitals do not need to reinvent the wheel; existing resources such as interpreter services and financial counselling could simply be better connected to telehealth services, and government-mandated financial assistance programs could be broadened to include telehealth. Policymakers and healthcare insurers should consider how existing regulations and reimbursement practices reinforce barriers to telehealth. Without such changes, advances in virtual healthcare options may come at the cost of worsening health inequities.",
