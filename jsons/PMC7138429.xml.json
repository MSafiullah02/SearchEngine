Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections remain a worldwide health problem, and no vaccine is currently available. While a number of small molecule inhibitors of virally encoded enzymes are showing promise in clinical trials and some have now been approved by the US FDA, cures of HCV generally require multiple agents with different mechanisms of action due to the development of viral resistance. Such viral escape results from the high error rate of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which allows rapid exploration of sequence space, creating myriad quasispecies that may include mutations conferring resistance to any given drug. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and their cousins small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) have two advantages over small molecule drugs that suggest a potential solution to the viral resistance problem: first, they can potentially target conserved but \u201cundruggable\u201d sequences anywhere in the viral genome, including noncoding sequences, and second, multiple small siRNAs or shRNAs can be combined to foil the ability of the virus to escape through single-site mutations. Chronic HCV infection, which represents the most common form of this disease, is also attractive as a disease target for RNAi because the course of the infection is slow. Thus, there is plenty of time for the biology of RNA interference to take place, in contrast to some very rapid viral infections in which viral replication may outrun treatments that require some hours to take full effect.",

Their short length (around 40 nt) distinguishes them from more traditional shRNAs in both potency and mechanism of action.",

A total of 3\u20134 million people are newly infected each year (Armstrong et al. 2000; Alter et al. 1999; Shepard et al. 2005; Ray Kim 2002). Approximately 250,000 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons in the United States are coinfected with HCV (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hepatitis/c/). HCV is recognized as a major cause of end-stage liver disease, such as liver cancer (with 1\u20135% of HCV cases leading to this outcome) and cirrhosis (10\u201320% of cases), and is the leading indication for liver transplantation in the Western world (Shepard et al. 2005). Chronic liver disease ranks as the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, and HCV is estimated to account for 40\u201360% of these cases. Mortality related to HCV infection (death from liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma) is expected to increase over the next two decades (Deuffic-Burban et al. 2007).",

The standard treatment is a combination of pegylated interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and ribavirin, which is effective in 40\u201380% of patients, depending on the genotype. Efficacy has been around 50% in patients infected with HCV genotype 1, which comprises nearly 70% of cases in the western hemisphere, although the success rate is improving with the addition of newly approved protease inhibitors to the standard treatment. The response rate for HIV\u2013HCV coinfected patients is lower, estimated at 30\u201340% (Torriani et al. 2004). Because interferon is associated with severe adverse effects, including flu-like symptoms, hematologic abnormalities, and depression, patient compliance has been poor with an estimated 30% of patients refusing treatment. Considering that the incidence of HCV is increasing worldwide and that within 10 years more deaths from HCV than HIV are predicted by the Centers for Disease Control, safer and more efficacious HCV drugs are urgently needed (Deuffic-Burban et al. 2004, 2006; Law et al. 2003; Salomon et al. 2002).",

They can be divided into those that target the virus directly [direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents] and those that affect host targets (Ronn and Sandstrom 2008; Liu-Young and Kozal 2008; Beaulieu 2007). DAAs include small molecules as well as ribozymes, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), decoy RNAs, RNA aptamers, siRNAs, and shRNAs. Host-targeting agents include small molecules such as cyclophilin inhibitors, antifibrotic agents, antibodies, modified interferons with improved pharmacokinetics, and oligonucleotides complementary to the required host factor microRNA-122 (miR-122) (Lanford et al. 2010). As mentioned above, the high genetic diversity and rapid mutation and turnover rates of HCV (1010\u20131012 new particles produced per day with an error rate of 10\u22123\u201310\u22125 mutations per nucleotide per genomic replication) result in the rapid emergence of viral resistance with many single DAAs (Okamoto et al. 1992; Neumann et al. 1998; Ogata et al. 1991; Sarrazin and Zeuzem 2010). For instance, although clinical studies showed that the use of protease inhibitors in combination with pegylated interferon-\u03b1 (peg-IFN) and ribavirin increased the rate of sustained viral response (SVR) by at least 20% compared with peg-IFN and ribavirin alone in patients infected with HCV genotype 1, the existence of viral variants with reduced susceptibility has been observed (Deuffic-Burban et al. 2004, 2009, 2012; Sarrazin and Zeuzem 2010; Robinson et al. 2011).",

            "text": "The mechanism of RNAi is complex and can involve alternative pathways (Filipowicz 2005; Siomi and Siomi 2009). Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules are recognized and processed by one or more RNase III-family enzymes (Hammond et al. 2000; Zamore et al. 2000; Bernstein et al. 2001). Primary transcripts encoding microRNAs (pri-miRs) are processed in the nucleus by a \u201cmicroprocessor\u201d complex to individual hairpins before export to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, dsRNAs longer than ~23 bp, including hairpins, are processed by Dicer into double-stranded siRNAs whose strands are each 21\u201323 nucleotides (nt) in length. Dicer contains a PAZ domain that binds specifically to the 3\u2032 end of single-stranded RNA and two RNase III domains that possess the catalytic cleavage activity. The distance between the 3\u2032-overhang-binding PAZ domain and the active site of the RNase III domains provides a molecular ruler corresponding to the length of an siRNA duplex (Jinek and Doudna 2009). The cleavage products of Dicer have characteristic termini, a monophosphate group at the 5\u2032 end, and a two-nucleotide overhang with a 3\u2032-hydroxyl at the 3\u2032 end (MacRae and Doudna 2007). sRNAs, whether generated by dicing of a precursor RNA or introduced from outside the cell, are loaded into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) containing a protein of the Argonaute (Ago) family (Elbashir et al. 2001; Lee et al. 2004; Pham et al. 2004; Tomari et al. 2004a, b; Jinek and Doudna 2009). Ago proteins contain PAZ, middle (MID), and PIWI domains. The binding of an siRNA to an Ago is aided by the presence of a 5\u2032 phosphate group and a 3\u2032 dinucleotide overhang at the termini. As with Dicer, the 3\u2032 overhang binds to the PAZ domain of Ago. The 5\u2032 phosphate group binds in a pocket at the interface between the MID domain and the PIWI domain (Jinek and Doudna 2009).",

To render the \u201cguide\u201d (antisense) strand of an siRNA available to pair with its target, the passenger strand must be removed. The selection of which strand is to be removed and which retained is thought to be largely governed by asymmetry in the thermodynamic profile of the siRNA duplex termini (Schwarz et al. 2003; Khvorova et al. 2003). After the RISC-loading complex (which contains the dsRNA binding protein TRBP along with Dicer and Ago2) loads an siRNA duplex into Ago2, Ago2 cleaves (or \u201cslices\u201d) the \u201cpassenger\u201d (sense) strand at a position opposite 10 nt from the 5\u2032-phosphate of the guide strand, facilitating the dissociation and/or degradation by C3PO (Ye et al. 2011) of the resulting passenger-strand fragments. The loss of the passenger strand from the complex produces the active RISC. The anchoring of the 5\u2032 phosphate group into the binding pocket of Ago is essential, and the distance from it determines the position of the cleavage site in the passenger strand (this Ago2-mediated passenger-strand cleavage was also found in the processing of some microRNAs [miRNAs] (Diederichs and Haber 2007).",

            "text": "When passenger-strand slicing is blocked by chemical modification or by mismatches between the two strands of the siRNA, a slower, alternative pathway dissociates and destroys the passenger strand, possibly via an ATP-dependent helicase (RNA helicase A), yielding the active RISC (Matranga et al. 2005; Leuschner et al. 2006; Miyoshi et al. 2005; Kraynack and Baker 2006; Robb and Rana 2007; Rand et al. 2005). RISC uses the bound single-stranded RNA molecule as a guide to \u201csearch\u201d the resident population of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for complementary sequences, eventually cleaving these transcripts and thereby downregulating the expression of the targeted gene (Hammond et al. 2000; Dorsett and Tuschl 2004; Kim and Rossi 2008; Elbashir et al. 2001; Nykanen et al. 2001; Martinez et al. 2002). The currently favored model for target recognition and cleavage by Ago2 is as follows: The target binds to the seed region of the 5\u2032 half of the guide sequence and then base pairing proceeds toward its 3\u2032 end. This results in the 3\u2032 end of the guide strand dissociating from the PAZ domain, leading to a conformational change that positions the active site of Ago2 at the cleavage site on the target (Filipowicz 2005; Tomari and Zamore 2005). The position of the scissile phosphate group of the target mRNA is similar to that in the passenger strand, i.e., 10 nt from the 5\u2032-phosphate group of the guide strand. Mismatches at the 10th and 11th nucleotides prevent the slicing activity (Jinek and Doudna 2009).",

New understanding of how RNAi regulates gene expression is also leading to the rapid development of RNAi-based therapeutics, especially in the area of viral disease. For example, RNAi approaches targeting viral genes, including those of the HIV, influenza, and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses (Table 1), respiratory syncytial virus, polio virus, the SARS coronavirus, alphaviruses, and the Marburg and dengue fever viruses, have been shown to limit viral replication in cell culture and, in some cases, in animals (Rossi et al. 2007; Barik and Bitko 2006; Watanabe et al. 2007; Arbuthnot et al. 2007; Seyhan et al. 2007; Gitlin et al. 2002; Fowler et al. 2005; Haasnoot et al. 2003). A number of siRNA drug candidates are in clinical trials (Castanotto and Rossi 2009). Moreover, mechanistic studies of dsRNA/siRNA/miRNA processing by Dicer and Ago2 have also led to the development of algorithms for efficient target selection; chemical modification for improved specificity, functionality, and longevity; and new designs for RNAi triggers such as Dicer substrate, ssiRNA, etc., that benefit both basic and applied research (Bolcato-Bellemin et al. 2007; Collingwood et al. 2008).\n",

            "text": "An shRNA consists of largely paired antisense and sense sequences connected by a loop of unpaired nucleotides. A duplex stem of typically 24\u201329 bp, either fully paired or with miRNA-style internal mismatches or loops, is commonly used in vector-expressed shRNAs (Silva et al. 2005; Stegmeier et al. 2005; Boudreau et al. 2008). Although target site selection is critical to silencing activity, the structural design of the shRNA also plays a significant role. With appropriate design, shRNAs can be at least as active as siRNAs targeting the same site. Although the structure\u2013activity relationship of siRNAs has been extensively examined and a 19-bp RNA duplex with 2-nucleotide overhangs at the 3\u2032 ends of each strand is widely used, there have been only a handful of studies on the effect of hairpin structures on efficacy of target silencing. The factors involved in shRNA design are loop size and sequence, stem length, presence of internal mismatches or single-stranded overhangs, and whether it is expressed or synthetic and directly delivered. As with siRNAs, stem length determines whether the molecule is a substrate for Dicer. In the context of vector expression, fully matched shRNAs have been compared with shRNAs containing internal mismatches from sequence alterations in the passenger arm, and the fully matched shRNAs were found to be more potent (Li et al. 2007; Boudreau et al. 2008). The loop can be almost any size, from 2 to 10 or more nucleotides. Brummelkamp et al. found that an expressed 19-bp shRNA with a 9-nt loop provided better target knockdown than similar shRNAs with 5- or 7-nt loops (Brummelkamp et al. 2002). The efficacy seen with expressed shRNAs depends on expression level as well as design parameters (Hinton et al. 2008; Kawasaki et al. 2003; Zhou et al. 2009). To investigate design parameters alone, several groups have examined the impact of structural changes to synthetic hairpins and found that the lengths of both stems and loops can affect efficacy. Li et al. reported that in the context of 4-nt loops, shRNAs with 29-bp stems silenced target gene expression more efficiently than those with 19-bp stems, but 19-bp shRNAs with 9-nt loops outperformed shRNAs with longer stems, including 29-bp shRNAs with 4-nt loops (Li et al. 2007). Our group found that, in the context of 10-nt loops, 19-bp shRNAs were somewhat more potent than similar 19-bp and 25-bp siRNAs and 25-bp shRNAs were less potent than any of the 19-bp shRNAs or siRNAs tested (Vlassov et al. 2007).",

Harborth et al. reported that an shRNA with its antisense sequence at the 5\u2032 end of the hairpin (left-hand loop, L-type shRNA) showed comparable silencing efficacy to an R shRNA if the stem length was 21\u201329 nt (Harborth et al. 2003). However, when the stem length was shortened to 19 bp (with a 4-nt loop), much less potency was found with R shRNA, whereas L shRNA retained a potency comparable to that of shRNAs with 21\u201329-bp stems. Similar results were obtained by another group with a CD8-specific shRNA (McManus et al. 2002). Together, these results suggested that 19-bp shRNAs may be processed differently from shRNAs of 24 bp or longer. A major difference is that, of the longer shRNAs, both R and L types are processed by Dicer to generate the same ~19-bp siRNAs. In contrast, 19-bp shRNAs were found not to be Dicer substrates (Siolas et al. 2005; McManus et al. 2002). To distinguish shRNAs with 19 or fewer base pairs from longer, Dicer substrate shRNAs, we have designated the former as short shRNAs or sshRNAs.\n",

Further shortening of the stem to 16 nt in each strand (connected by UU, which might form a 15-bp stem with a GUUC loop) resulted in somewhat lower activity, and an sshRNA with 15 nt in each arm of the duplex had very little activity. This indicates that potent silencing activity requires a hairpin with a duplex length of at least 16 bp. Interestingly, an sshRNA with a stem of 16 bp consisting of a 19-nt antisense sequence connected directly to a 17-nt sense sequence showed similar potency compared to its parent molecule with 19-bp stem and UU linker.\n",

            "text": "To further examine the structure\u2013function relationships of sshRNAs and how they may differ from Dicer-substrate shRNAs, our group undertook an extensive structure\u2013activity and mechanistic study of sshRNAs targeting three partially overlapping sequences within the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of HCV (Ge et al. 2010a, b; Dallas et al. 2012). For two of these target sites, L-type sshRNAs showed significantly higher potency than R-type; for the third, there was little difference between the two hairpin types. Unlike R-sshRNAs, where loop sizes of 5 nt or greater were optimal (Vlassov et al. 2007; Li et al. 2007), the L-sshRNAs were more potent when the loop size was very small (1 or 2 nt) than when it was larger (5 or 10 nt) (Fig. 3). The IC50 of an L-sshRNA of 19 bp and a UU loop was slightly more potent than a corresponding siRNA targeting the same region. The loop sequence appeared not to affect the sshRNA activity since three different loop sequences, including one derived from the microRNA miR-23, gave the same results. However, nucleotides adjacent to the loop may affect the activity as they can affect the actual size of the loop. For example, a CG base pair next to a UU loop can be paired and result in an actual 2-nt loop (Jucker and Pardi 1995), whereas if that base pair is AU or UA, strain in a 2-nt loop may keep them unpaired, resulting in a 4-nt loop of AUUU or UUUA. Based on studies involving chemical modification, conditional dicer-knockout cells, and Ago immunoprecipitation, we concluded (Dallas et al. 2012) that L-sshRNAs having UU loops [which are naturally quite resistant to RNase cleavage (Ge et al. 2010a)] require passenger-arm cleavage to be maximally active, but the loops remain intact in the active RISC, with the guide strand breaking its base pairs with the truncated passenger strand to allow pairing with the target. Passenger-strand \u201cslicing\u201d is needed apparently to facilitate opening of the guide-passenger duplex. L-sshRNAs have their guide sequence at the 5\u2032 side of the loop, so the 5\u2032 end of the guide sequence is immediately available for phosphorylation and binding to the MID pocket of Ago2. R-sshRNAs, on the other hand, require a larger loop for full activity because the loop must be cleaved by some nuclease to create a terminal phosphate at the 5\u2032 end of the guide strand (see Fig. 1). In this case, passenger-arm slicing is less important because the cleavage of the loop itself facilitates removal of the passenger strand in active RISC.\n",

Whether these shRNAs form the expected hairpin structures in solution is frequently ignored. We have found that synthetic shRNAs, irrespective of stem length, loop size, or L vs. R loop orientation, can form dimers or even oligomers (Ge et al. 2010b). Dimerization of hairpin RNAs has been also documented in retroviral RNAs, tRNAs, and some artificial RNA hairpins (Sun et al. 2007). The propensity of hairpin RNAs to dimerize depends on their loop size, sequence, and concentration as well as how they are handled (Bernacchi et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2005). When shRNAs are heated to 95\u00b0C and quickly cooled in an ice bath (snap cooling), dimerization can be eliminated (Ge et al. 2010a). Interestingly, sshRNAs showed efficient target knockdown both before and after the heating/snap cooling procedure, even for some sshRNAs that were predominantly dimers before the treatment, suggesting that the dimers of certain sshRNAs are functional molecules that can be processed and utilized by the RNAi machinery with similar efficiency as the monomers. However, the presence of long duplex regions in dimers can provoke immune stimulation. The heating/cooling procedure greatly reduces this immune stimulation (Table 2).\n",

In a study of the effects of 2\u2032-O-methyl, 2\u2032-deoxy (DNA), and phosphorothioate modifications at various positions in the stem, loop, and overhangs, we found that placing a 2\u2032-O-Me on each nucleotide of the loop and alternate nucleotides of the passenger arm, but leaving an unmodified window of 4 nt at the slicer site, provided significantly greater stability in 10% human serum (Fig. 5) while abrogating induction of the innate immune system (Ge et al. 2010a). It can be seen from Table 3 that two sshRNAs of the same structure but different sequences can have very different immunostimulatory properties. Blunt sshRNAs are particularly efficient at inducing RIG-I. In each case, however, 2\u2032-O-methylation renders them non-stimulatory, by blocking recognition by pattern recognition sensors such as RIG-I. These modifications had essentially no effect on potency, but placing modifications in most positions of the guide arm or the slicer site of the passenger arm reduced their efficacy. Phosphorothioate modifications were found to induce interferon-beta (IFN-\u03b2) and TNF-\u03b1 in MRC-5 cells.\n\n",

L-sshRNAs with and without a 3\u2032 overhang as well as an siRNA, si19-3, all targeting the same sequence were chemically synthesized, and their ability to inhibit HCV IRES-dependent luciferase expression was compared in 293FT cells. (b) Stem length comparison. L-sshRNAs (UU loop) against the same target sequence but with different stem lengths were compared for their inhibitory activity in 293FT cells. SG105 differs from SG142 in lacking a 3\u2032 UU overhang. (c) Effect of using part of the antisense sequence as the loop. SG119 has a 19-nt antisense sequence directly linked with a 17-nt sense sequence, probably forming a 16-bp duplex and 4-nt loop (UGCA). (d) Stem length comparison with SG119 derivatives. SG131 and SG132 have UU to connect the 3\u2032 end of the antisense and 5\u2032 end of the sense strands. They were compared with SG119 for target knockdown in 293FT cells. si131 has two complementary strands 16 nt in length with UU overhangs at their 3\u2032 ends. as/s values represent the nucleotide lengths of antisense and sense strands.

(b) Loop-adjacent base pair comparison. sshRNAs against the same target region as si72 but with loops of 5 nt (SG72 and SG72L) and 2 nt (SG118 and SG103) and left- (SG72L and SG118) and right-loop (SG72 and SG103) orientation were compared for their inhibitory activity in 293FT cells.

Activity was determined by potency in suppressing the expression of an HCV IRES-fLuc reporter in 293FT cells, by cotransfecting them in triplicate with the reporter DNA. An unmodified siRNA specific for the same target, si19-3, was used as a positive control.
