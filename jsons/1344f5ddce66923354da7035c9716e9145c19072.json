Some of the viruses are circulating in the cattle population, as for instance PI3 virus, which is common in the respiratory tract and is easily transmitted. High percentages of seropositive animals were found in various countries. Serological surveys have shown that, on the contrary, BVDV was much less frequent on farms separated geographically than on farms with a close contact of animals on common pastures. Collectivization of calves with a different immunological status like that occurring on breeder farms or in large feedlots, leads to accumulation of viruses introduced by animals in the incubation or convalescence stages or by latent carriers. Under these circumstances, explosive outbreaks of respiratory and enteric disease may occur. It is unknown how stress factors during massive transport and crowding promote pathogenicity of various respiratory viruses, because it is not possible to mimic a natural outbreak by experimental infection. All too frequently only a mild disease is reproduced. Some of the viruses per se have an adverse influence on defence mechanisms. It was shown that infection with PI3 virus may initially diminish the cell-mediated immune response; also, BVDV may act on lymphocytes and neutrophils, suppressing antibody production and phagocytosis, respectively. Suppression may promote invasion of other agents, particularly through close contact and crowding in stables lacking proper ventilation. As regards diagnosis, a somewhat pathetic conclusion can be drawn: if foot-and-mouth disease virus is isolated from an animal, the disease has been identified. However, if PI3 virus or BVDV has been isolated, you have diagnosed the infection but not an \"acute respiratory/enteric disease\", because other viruses and also bacteria might be etiologically involved.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INFECTION AND DISEASE"}, {"text": "As diagnostic techniques become more widely applied, an increasing number of viruses has been isolated from cattle with acute respiratory disease. At the end of the 1950s, \"shipping fever\" was described as a disease following massive transports to or from the enormous feedlots of the USA, and PI3 virus was isolated as the first virus of a condition with a multiple viral etiology.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INFECTION AND DISEASE"}, {"text": "In Sweden, at about the same time, there were outbreaks of a severe acute respiratory-enteric syndrome on farms in the Ume\u00e2 district in the northern part of the country. Local veterinarians provisionally called the syndrome \"Ume\u00e2 disease\". Thus BVDV became the second member of a multiple etiology.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INFECTION AND DISEASE"}, {"text": "At that time, PI3 virus was suspected to be the cause of the infection in the respiratory tract (manifested by tracheitis and pneumonia), and BVDV to be the cause of infection in the intestinal tract (manifested by erosions in the oral and intestinal mucosa). Both viruses were indeed identified. However, it has to be kept in mind that the terms \"parainfluenza\" and \"bovine viral diarrhea\" are merely taxons by which these viruses are classified.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INFECTION AND DISEASE"}, {"text": "During the following decade, the first two bovine adenoviruses (types 1 and 2) were described in the USA, and subsequently a third type was identified in the UK. These are the isolates that grow in kidney cells with a hexon antigen common to all mastadenoviruses. Then Hungarian workers reported the isolation of two new bovine adenoviruses, types 4 and 5, which preferentially grow in cultured calf testicle cells. Then additional adenoviruses, types 6 through 8 were reported as \"testicle-cell types\" from various countries and, finally, from Bulgaria, a type 9 being a \"kidney-cell type\". Regarding the \"testicle-cell type\" adenoviruses, the proof for the presence of antigen(s) common to mastadenoviruses is equivocal at present.

The isolation of these viruses from apparently healthy cattle as well as from those with acute respiratory-enteric disease indicates that they are widespread. However, because they appear to be infrequently implicated in disease processes, it seems that they cause infection only under certain conditions. Bacteria such as Chlamydia, Pasteurellae and mycoplasmas may influence the cycles of infection with viruses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INFECTION AND DISEASE"}, {"text": "Young animals require more care than adult animals. Calves fare best when confined individually or in very small groups. This facilitates individual observation, control of diseased animals and maintenance of a higher standard of hygiene. A large number of animals maintained in close contact provides ideal conditions for the spread of disease agents via the respiratory tract. The immunological status, especially passive immunity of the animals, is important in connection with respiratory disease. Protective titers of serum antibodies have been calculated for some of the respiratory pathogens. PI3 virus infection seems to be prevented by a serum neutralizing antibody titer of 32 and IBRV infection by a titer of 2. The significance of local nasal antibodies and CMI against respiratory disease is of special importance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONTROL MEASURES"}, {"text": "With the complex etiology as that associated with respiratory infections it", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONTROL MEASURES"}, {"text": "is logical that control measures are not easy. Control of the disease may be attempted by diminishing the frequency of infections and by implementing a vaccination program against the most frequent agents. Some authors have tried to suppress infections by interferon or interferon inducers, i.e. avirulent viruses known to stimulate nonspecific defence mechanisms, including interferon production; however, no efficient control procedures have become available. The development of effective and practical vaccines for the prevention of respiratory disease is notoriously difficult, due to the multiplicity of agents which are involved. As shown in Table 34 , at least 15 distinct microorganisms have been identified. Certain viruses, however, produce more severe disease than others; vaccines against them may be expected to break the chain of events leading to respiratory disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 648, "end": 656, "text": "Table 34", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Virus infections of ruminants"}, {"text": "The multiplicity of agents necessitates the use of polyvalent vaccines; polyvalence does not appear to affect the immunogenicity of the individual agents.
