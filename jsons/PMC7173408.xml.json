The innate defense includes (1) phagocytic cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils) that engulf invading viruses, (2) natural killer (NK) cells that lyse infected cells, (3) activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that induce inflammatory mediators to stimulate the maturation of innate immune cells and their recruitment to the site of infection. This also induces the interferon response with direct antiviral activity and contributes significantly to the development of an adaptive immune response several days later, (4) small interfering RNA molecules (RNAi) that interfere with virus replication, and (5) induction of apoptosis (programmed cell death) that leads to elimination of infected cells.",

Monocytes display considerable mobility and a homing capacity for sites of infection, infiltrating tissue, and thence differentiating into macrophages. Macrophages and dendritic cells occupy key locations in various tissues, for example, alveolar macrophages in the lung, Kupffer cells in the liver, and Langerhans dendritic cells in the skin. Both monocytes and macrophages are important initiators of the immune response against viral invasion. Macrophages often become the predominant cell within a focus of infection by 24 hours. Activated macrophages have increased chemotactic activity, phagocytic activity, and digestive powers. Dendritic cells carry out afferent immune functions at all body surfaces by promoting the transfer of immune signals and cells into the regional lymph nodes where together with the liver and spleen most phagocytic removal of foreign particles occurs. All three cell types bear immunoglobulin Fc and C3b receptors on their cell surface to promote the phagocytosis of immune complexes (consisting of virions coated with antibody). By serving as \u201cprofessional\u201d antigen-presenting cells these cells exercise a controlling influence over the rapidity, magnitude, and dynamics of the immune response. Macrophages then also contribute to the efferent limb of the immune response: cytokines secreted by activated T cells bring more monocytes into the infection focus that then become differentiated into macrophages.",

Dendritic cells infected with viruses lose endocytic capacity, allowing the virus the opportunity to migrate into distant organs and tissues, for example, HIV and Ebola virus. The Ebola virus VP35 protein (see Chapter 28: Filoviruses) blocks dendritic cell activation and effectively breaks the link between innate and adaptive immunity. A few viruses, for example, poxviruses and herpesviruses, trigger dendritic cell apoptosis, with the result of a reduced capacity of the system to present viral antigens to the adaptive immune system.",

            "text": "NK cells are another important component of the early defense system, with the activity of these cells greatly enhanced within one to two days of viral infection. Resting NK cells are found in large quantities in the spleen, uterus, liver, and blood, but can be rapidly recruited to any site in the body in response to chemokine signaling from damaged tissue, tumor cells, and cells infected with a pathogen. The NK cell surface markers include the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM: CD56) or the low affinity IgG receptor CD16, or both. These large, non-phagocytic cells of the lymphoid system share the same lineage as mature T cells of the adaptive immune system, but differ in a number of important regards. The first is that NK cells lack T cell receptors (TCRs) but are activated by recognizing infected or tumor cells on which the density of molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC: see Chapter 6: Adaptive Immune Responses to Infection) has been reduced. Viruses downregulate surface MHC class I molecules, in order to escape recognition by CD8+T cells. However, cells lacking class I MHC molecules are susceptible to NK cells: the so-called missing self hypothesis. This reduced MHC density on the target cell disturbs the balance between activator and inhibitory receptor signaling at the surface of the NK cell, as the inhibitory receptors recognize class I MHC molecules on the surface of healthy cells. Second, NK cells are activated by several non-antigen-specific mechanisms to produce preformed pore-inducing (perforin) and granzyme molecules that induce apoptosis in the target cell: this is in contrast to cytotoxic, CD8+T cells of the adaptive immune response that only produce these effector molecules once activated via recognition of class I MHC molecules in association with viral peptides. The third, and most important, difference is that NK cells do not need to proliferate and differentiate into viral-specific cells before activation. Overall, NK cells, while not displaying any immunological specificity for particular viral antigens, play an essential role in defense by mediating the death of infected cells by apoptosis, and by priming the adaptive response through secretion of several cytokines including interferon \u03b3, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), IL-4, and IL-13 (Fig. 5.1\n).",

These fall into five broad strategies (Table 5.2\n). Four of these strategies are designed to interfere with the stimulation of NK cells by the presence of infected cells, either by enhancing inhibitory signals or blocking stimulatory signals to NK cells. For example the herpesvirus protein UL18 mimics host cell class I MHC molecules, such that, when bound with NK inhibitory cellular receptors, cell activation is suppressed. Viruses can also have a direct effect on NK cells. Both HIV and herpes simplex virus can infect NK cells in vitro, and the E2 protein of hepatitis C virus binds directly to the CD81 protein on the surface of NK cells leading to inhibition of activation signals.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, an early important line of defense is the recognition of viral components by germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) capable of distinguishing viral products from those of the host. PRRs are expressed in many cell types likely to be present at portals of virus entry, including macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, NK cells, endothelial cells, and mucosal epithelial cells. These cellular receptor molecules recognize different classes of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). There are a number of classes of PRRs that are present on the majority of mammalian cells. These include the C-type lectin receptors, NOD-like receptors, the trans-membrane Toll like Receptor (TLR) receptors, and the cytosolic RIG-I like receptors (RLR) such as RIG-I and MDA5. TLRs consist of amino-terminal leucine-rich repeat domains responsible for PAMP recognition and a cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain that recognizes interleukin-1 and leads to downstream signal transduction. In contrast, the RLRs recognize associated PAMP via caspase activation and recruitment (CARD) domains. Common to both classes of PRR, the PRR\u2013PAMP complex then triggers a series of signaling cascades, culminating in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other signaling molecules designed to limit the spread of infection, including interferons (see below). Importantly, these molecules also play an important role in the development of adaptive immune responses necessary for viral clearance and sustained, long-term immunological memory.",

One important PAMP consists of double-stranded RNA replicative intermediate structures, as will be discussed below. Although the 21 naturally occurring amino acids could theoretically assume diverse molecular structures in forming viral proteins, in reality the repertoire of secondary polypeptide folds that act as PAMPs is more limited, governed by the polar (hydrophilic) and non-polar (hydrophobic) side chains of individual amino acids. A prime illustration is a comparison of the VP1 major capsid proteins of biologically unrelated picornaviruses: sequence alignments show little homology yet these proteins fold to give the morphology characteristic of this virus family. Of course the adaptive immune response can distinguish these amino acid differences thus enabling a virus-specific response.",

Viral evasion strategies include the degradation of TLR signaling components, interference with transcription factors, and mimicry of cellular proteins. Given its importance in dsRNA recognition, the TLR3 pathway is frequently targeted, with TRIF, the adaptor for TLR3, being particularly targeted for degradation by viral proteases. This targeting of TRIF is particularly effective, as TRIF abrogation also inhibits both NF-\u03baB and IRF3 production. Other points downstream in the pathways may also be blocked: the IKK complex, for example, a complex of cellular kinases pivotal in several activation pathways, is often inhibited, as is ubiquitination, a regulatory process controlling protein turnover and cellular location. The serine protease (NS3/4A) of hepatitis C virus and the 3C protease of several picornaviruses can all cleave TRIF leading to an attenuated antiviral response, but targeting TRIF is not confined to RNA viruses. For example, TRIF levels are significantly downregulated during gamma herpesvirus infections.

For example, the V protein of paramyxoviruses mimics IRF3 and acts as a non-functional substrate for IRF3 kinases, thereby inhibiting pathways initiated by TLR3 binding to viral RNA. Perhaps the best studied viruses in this respect are the poxviruses: protein A49 effectively blocks through mimicry the induction of type I IFN through abolishing NF-\u03baB activation, a key molecule for the induction of IFN gene transcription (see above and Fig. 5.2).",

HIV and simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) are recognized by several host restriction factors in their respective human and non-human primate hosts. Tripartite motif-containing protein 5\u03b1 (TRIM5\u03b1) is a species-specific host restriction factor that restricts the replication of HIV-1 in Old World monkeys such as rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. Rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 restricts HIV-1 infection by interacting with the HIV-1 capsid at an early stage of infection, and is believed to be involved in the innate immune response to retroviral infection. Similarly, apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing, enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) is a host protein; APOBEC3G restricts the replication of retroviruses including HIV and SIV, by converting deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine on the minus strand of viral DNA during reverse transcription, thereby introducing (often lethal) mutations into the genome. The retroviral protein viral infectivity factor (Vif) counteracts this by binding to, and assisting degradation of, APOBEC3G via a ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway.",

Type II IFN-\u03b3 is an antiparallel homodimer exhibiting a twofold axis of symmetry. It binds two IFNGR1 receptor chains, assembling a complex that is stabilized by two IFNGR2 chains. These receptors are associated with two kinases from the JAK family: Janus (JAK)1 and tyrosine (TYK2) for types I and III IFNs; JAK1 and JAK2 for type II IFN. All IFN receptor chains belong to the class 2 helical cytokine receptor family, with the 200 amino acid extracellular domains usually contain the ligand binding site.

In dendritic cells, TLR7 and TLR8 located in endosomal compartments recognize viral ssRNA after direct infection, autophagocytic uptake of viral material from cytoplasm, or phagocytic uptake of other infected cells or vial particles. Both TLR7 and TLR8 signal through the adapter MyD88, which through interaction with the IRAK4\u2013IRAK1\u2013TRAF6 complex leads to phosphorylation and activation of IRF7 and subsequent IFN transcription. TLR3 located in endosomes of DCs, macrophages, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts, is activated by encountering dsRNA. Following its activation, TLR3 signals through its adapter, TRIF, which leads to activation of non-canonical IKK kinases (TBK1/IKK\u03b5) and subsequent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. Nuclear factor \u03ba B (NF-\u03baB) is also activated by TRIF-mediated signaling through canonical IKK kinases (IKK\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3). Cytoplasmically located RIG-1 and MDA5 are expressed in most cells and recognize 5\u2019ppp-containing dsRNA or long dsRNA, respectively. Both of these cytoplasmic sensors upon activation interact and signal through the mitochondrially located adapter, MAVS. This signaling pathway, analogous to that of TLR3, leads to activation of the canonical and non-canonical IKK kinases and the following nuclear translocation of NF\u03baB and IRF3.
