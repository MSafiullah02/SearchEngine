            "text": "Viral respiratory tract infections in lung transplant recipients may be severe. During three consecutive winter-spring seasons, 49 symptomatic lung transplant recipients with suspected respiratory viral infection, and 26 asymptomatic patients were investigated for presence of respiratory viruses either in 56 nasopharyngeal aspirate or 72 bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken at different times after transplantation. On the whole, 1 asymptomatic (3.4%) and 28 symptomatic (57.1%) patients were positive for human metapneumovirus (hMPV, 4 patients), influenza virus A (3 patients), and B (2 patients), respiratory syncytial virus (2 patients), human coronavirus (2 patients), human parainfluenza virus (2 patients), rhinovirus (5 patients), while 4 patients were coinfected by 2 respiratory viruses, and 5 were infected sequentially by 2 or more respiratory viruses. In bronchoalveolar lavage samples, hMPV predominated by far over the other viruses, being responsible for 60% of positive specimens, whereas other viruses were present in nasopharyngeal aspirates at a comparable rate. RT-PCR (detecting 43 positive samples/128 examined) was largely superior to monoclonal antibodies (detecting 17 positive samples only). In addition, HCMV was detected in association with a respiratory virus in 4/18 HCMV-positive patients, and was found at a high concentration (>10 5 DNA copies/ml) in 3/16 (18.7%) patients with HCMV-positive bronchoalveolar lavage samples and pneumonia. Coinfections and sequential infections by HCMV and respiratory viruses were significantly more frequent in patients with acute rejection and steroid treatment. In conclusion: (i) about 50% of respiratory tract infections of lung transplant recipients were associated with one or more respiratory viruses; (ii) hMPV largely predominates in bronchoalveolar lavage of symptomatic lung transplant recipients, thus suggesting a causative role in lower respiratory tract infections; (iii) RT-PCR appears to be the method of choice for detection of respiratory viruses in lung transplant recipients, (iv) a high HCMV load in bronchoalveolar lavage is a risk factor for viral pneumonia, suggesting some measure of intervention for the control of viral infection.

The overall incidence of infections caused by different respiratory viruses is reported to vary between 3 and 7 cases per 100 patients in cumulated cohorts of lung transplant recipients, reaching a global incidence of about 20% when considering hRSV, influenzaviruses A and B, hPIV, and hAdV infections altogether [Ohori et al., 1995; Matar et al., 1999; Vilchez et al., 2001 Vilchez et al., , 2002 Billings et al., 2002] . Most of these studies were conducted using poorly sensitive methods for virus detection, while other viruses, such as human coronaviruses (hCoV), rhinoviruses or the recently identified human metapneumovirus (hMPV), were not investigated.",

The immunological approach was aimed at virus identification following staining with monoclonal antibodies of both cells from nasopharyngeal aspirates and inoculated cell cultures. The molecular approach was based on use of PCR-based assays aimed at amplifying nucleic acids from respiratory samples.

These 3 patients were part of the group of 21 patients with respiratory infections not caused by common respiratory viruses. All three patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit within 6 months after transplantation because of fever, dyspnoea, reduced lung function, and radiologic signs of pneumonia. In two patients, bacterial infections (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus) were associated with HCMV and treated with antibiotics. In patient #1, HCMV infection was both systemic and local, and HCMV load in blood reached a peak greater than 100 pp65-positive/ 2 \u00c2 10 5 leukocytes examined (cut-off for preemptive therapy), thus requiring initiation of antiviral treatment. In patients #2 and #3, HCMV infection was only local and virus was not detected in blood. Thus, patients were not treated, following guidelines adopted in our department. However, all three patients recovered within 2 months and long-term control of HCMV infection in both blood and bronchoalveolar lavage was attained. This was likely due to the fact that in patient #1, the high viral load detected in both blood and lungs 1 month after transplantation was initially controlled by antiviral treatment with ganciclovir prior to the subsequent development of an efficient T-cell immune response. On the other hand, in patients #2 and #3 HCMV load in lungs (prompted by steroid treatment due to acute rejection occurring more than 2 months after transplantation) was controlled by the HCMV- specific CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe immune responses, which were reconstituted 3-6 months after surgery (Table III) .

In particular, in the current study, the significantly higher incidence of hMPV infections in bronchoalveolar lavage was surprising when compared to nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, while all the other respiratory viruses were detected at a comparable rate at the two sites. Although this respiratory virus [van den Hoogen et al., 2001] has been reported to be pathogenic for immunocompromised patients, the present findings suggest the need for careful monitoring of hMPV infections in lung transplant recipients. Molecular methods, such as RT-PCR, should be adjusted to detect all hMPV subtypes [Sarasini et al., in press] , while hMPV-specific monoclonal antibodies have been recently developed in our laboratory as a complement to or an alternative to RT-PCR for diagnosis of hMPV infections [Percivalle et al., [Garbino et al., 2004] . From a diagnostic standpoint, in this study the immunological approach for detection of respiratory viruses using monoclonal antibodies appeared to be much less sensitive than the molecular approach using RT-PCR, the former detecting about 1/3 of samples positive by RT-PCR. Monoclonal antibodies may provide test results within 2 hr after nasopharyngeal aspirate collection. On the other hand, direct fluorescent antibody staining cannot be applied reliably to bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, for which rapid viral isolation in shell vial cultures followed by monoclonal antibodies identification should be the test of choice. Use of appropriate and sensitive methods for rapid detection of respiratory viruses is of crucial importance in light of advances in antiviral therapy and potential threats from pandemic influenza. In our study, use of zanamivir in three patients with lower respiratory tract infection caused by influenza viruses and use of ribavirin in four patients with lower respiratory infection caused by hRSV contributed to resolve the acute episode.",

Hence, the need for monitoring HCMV in both blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples in view of starting treatment even in the presence of high virus loads in bronchoalveolar lavage alone. Recently, Westall et al. [2004] have determined that DNA levels above 46,000 copies/ml in bronchoalveolar lavage samples are predictors of HCMV inclusions in the lung allograft of 100% lung transplant recipients. In addition, the same investigators have speculated that a HCMV load greater than 64,000 copies/ml is more likely to be associated with specific disease, such as HCMV pneumonitis [Sanchez et al., 2001] . In all three patients of our cohort with high HCMV load in bronchoalveolar lavage, local resolution of HCMV infection was achieved by reconstitution of specific T-cell immunity, which chronologically occurred in the absence of antiviral treatment in patients #2 and #3, and following a timely start of ganciclovir treatment at a full dosage in patient #1.",
