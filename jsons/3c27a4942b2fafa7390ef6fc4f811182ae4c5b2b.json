The amount of fl uid instilled is comparatively small, around 20 mL. On the other hand, there are therapeutic purposes for lavage techniques too. Often amounts of some aliquots of 20 mL are needed to remove tenacious secretions under bronchoscopy in patients suffering from chronic bronchitis, asthma, or bronchiectasis. This is sometimes necessary and the most simple therapeutic lavage technique. The most invasive lavage technique is whole lung lavage, a therapeutic procedure for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. It is performed under general anesthesia and double-lumen intubation. Repeated instillations of 1,000 mL are used up to 20 or more liters.",

Alternatively, one of the anterior segments or subsegments of the upper or lower lobes of both lungs may be used, if it is impossible or dif fi cult to carry it out at the standard site. If diffuse lung disease is the indication for BAL, a good interlobar correlation was found concerning lavage cell differentials, lymphocyte subpopulations, and asbestos body counts. While a single-site BAL cellular pro fi le is assumed to be representative of the lung as a whole in interstitial lung disease (ILD), some evidence suggests that this diagnostic procedure might be more useful if it was targeted to one of the pulmonary segments most affected, as identi fi ed by chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). In patients with marked radiographic heterogeneity or with localized lesions, such as in fl ammatory in fi ltrates, malignant lesions, or from other cause, it is recommended that the area of greatest abnormality, as seen on the chest radiograph or CT, should be chosen as the preferred site for BAL.

The most widespread technique is to instill the fl uid directly through the biopsy channel of the fi ber bronchoscope. Optimal recovery is accomplished by occluding the bronchial lumen with the bronchoscope. The tip of the bronchoscope is therefore advanced into a bronchial segment (or subsegment) until a wedge position is reached. Alternatively, a suction catheter through the working channel can be used. The catheter is placed more peripherally to subsegmental or subsubsegmental bronchi. Local anesthesia fl uid should be removed prior to instillation of the lavage fl uid, since it may in fl uence cell viability. The fl uid is instilled with syringes using a standard number of input aliquots. Commonly 20-mL syringes are used (alternatively 60-mL) and four to fi ve aliquots are recommended up to a total volume of 100-300 mL. Smaller instilled volumes carry the risk of contamination by the bronchial spaces. Then a more \"bronchial\" washing component may dominate the cellular picture.",

Suction can cause airway collapse and traumatization of the airway mucosa, which may reduce recovery volume and change the fl uid pro fi le by adding blood. The optimal effect can be driven by the bronchoscopist by visual control. We prefer the use of 20-mL syringes and instillate the fl uid directly through the biopsy channel. A recovery of 40-70% of the instilled volume is normal. The fi rst aspirate may be the smallest one. Reasons for small recovery rates are emphysema, obstructive airway disease, smoking, or a higher age of the patient. Another important reason is a poor wedge position, which leads to leakage and coughing during BAL. Some reject the fi rst \"bronchial\" aliquot to avoid changes of the following \"alveolar\" aliquots. Siliconized or plastic containers are recommended to avoid loss of cells through adhesion to glass surfaces.",

In early published case series, the diagnostic value of BAL fi ndings was considered in isolation in groups of patients, without reference to a priori probabilities of individual diagnoses (based on the relative prevalence of individual disorders), the clinical presentation, or fi ndings of other tests. For this reason, these studies failed to quantify the true added diagnostic value of BAL in diffuse parenchymal lung disease. BAL may be useful in individual patients, in altering the balance of diagnostic probability, but is rarely diagnostic itself. A diagnostic likelihood of only 30-70% means major uncertainty. The same reservation applied to the predictive value of CD4/CD8 ratios. The prevailing problem is that no study exists in which BAL data are integrated with the pretest probability of disease, based not only on disease prevalence but also on age, sex, smoking history, mode of presentation, observed disease behavior, observed previous responsiveness to treatment, clinical evaluation, and the results of other tests. The problem has been compounded by the advent of HRCT, which has transformed the diagnostic landscape. The de fi nition of pre-BAL diagnostic probabilities has been re fi ned radically in the HRCT era, and thus, the landmark BAL series of the 1980s are now out of date.

Semiquantitative counting of bacteria helps to differentiate between colonization and infection. As a less invasive procedure, a mini-BAL technique has been described.

It is made by the combination of clinical, radiological, and laboratory criteria (new in fi ltration, fever or hypothermia, leukocytosis or leukopenia, putrid tracheal secretions) and quantitative culture of tracheal aspirations or BAL.

Increased levels of KL-6 in BAL fl uid and plasma correlate with the severity of alveolar in fl ammation and poor survival in acute respiratory distress syndrome.
