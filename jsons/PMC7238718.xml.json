In contrast, food justice researchers emphasize the structural conditions that affect food consumption. A food justice framework argues that food is more than just calories and grocery stores. Residential segregation and gentrification, racism in public health and medical institutions and labor conditions throughout the food sector contribute to racial and economic food-related health disparities.",

These disparities are rooted in racist urban development policies like redlining and urban renewal, which have long left communities of color without the means to invest in their built environments while targeting them for demolition through eminent domain. Efforts to \u201cgreen\u201d these neighborhoods by bringing in health stores and urban farms can increase property values and displace low-income people and people of color to areas with even more limited food access.",

Foods that are often touted as healthy are expensive, and many low-income families simply are forced to do without them. Food justice research also documents racism in food stores and in consulting with nutrition and health professionals. Additionally, the cultural whiteness of public health campaigns and alternative food movements can inadvertently exclude these communities.",

Black and Latinx workers are over-represented in the lowest-wage sectors of the food industry. Many of these workers are deemed \u201cessential\u201d and continue to risk their lives to keep the food system functioning. Major supermarket chains have reported employee deaths, and the soaring rates of infection in meatpacking plants reveals a rampant, industry-wide disregard for the safety of their workforces. People of color are also likely over-represented among Amazon warehouse and food delivery workers, who have had to strike for paid sick leave, sanitization procedures, and basic protections like hand sanitizer. As middle-class consumers\u2019 reliance on these services increases, those who perform this \u201cessential\u201d work remain unprotected physically, socially, and financially, contributing to elevated infection and mortality rates.",

As food justice scholars have long shown, food insecurity and workplace exploitation are disproportionately experienced by low-income people and people of color not because of poor choices, but because of structural racism and economic inequalities (Laster Pirtle 2020). Now, in the time of this pandemic, we are seeing that we do not have a strong social safety net to assist the large number of food-insecure households, nor do we have work protections to ensure that our lowest paid workers can make it through this crisis safely.",
