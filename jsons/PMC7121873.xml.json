Approximately 20\u201340% of the worldwide population fell ill and over 50 million people died. Outbreaks followed shipping routes from North America through Europe, Asia, Africa, Brazil and the South Pacific. The pandemic reached its peak after 5\u20136 months. Nearly 40 years later, in February 1957, the Asian influenza pandemic erupted in the Far East. Unlike the Spanish Flu, the Asian influenza pandemic virus was quickly identified and vaccines were available 6 months later. Approximately two million people died in this outbreak (compared to the 50 million in the Spanish Flu). Other known outbreaks in history, such as the Hong Kong Flu (1968\u20131969), the Avian Flu (1997) and SARS (2003) also resulted in high death tolls over the years. Unfortunately the threat of new pandemic outbreaks is still looming.",

Researchers at the Center for Humanitarian Logistics at Georgia Tech have shown that pandemic outbreak effects can be greatly reduced if quarantine is imposed at the early stages of the disease.1\n1 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) lay out guidelines and strategies for reducing disease transmission, including use of personal protective equipment (e.g., masks and gloves), hand hygiene, and safe work practices. The CDC also recommends actions to be taken during the earliest stage of a pandemic, when the first potential cases or disease clusters are detected. These include individual-level containment measures such as patient isolation and identification, monitoring, and quarantine of contacts.2\n2\n",

            "text": "The early detection of disease outbreaks therefore plays a major role in preventing disease transmission and reducing the size of the affected population. In modern biosurveillance a wide range of pre-diagnostic and diagnostic daily counts are monitored for the purpose of alerting public health officials when there is early evidence of a disease outbreak. This is in contrast to traditional biosurveillance, where only diagnostic measures (such as mortality and lab reports) are examined, usually locally, and at aggregation levels such as weekly, monthly, or annually. Moreover, in modern biosurveillance the goal is prospective while traditional biosurveillance is more retrospective in nature. Although the tasks and data types and structures differ widely between traditional and modern biosurveillance, most monitoring algorithms have been migrated from traditional to modern systems. The result is that current modern biosurveillance detection methods suffer from multiple statistical and practical limitations that greatly deteriorate their ability to achieve their intended purpose. For a general overview of the statistical challenges that arise in biosurveillance see Shmueli and Burkom (2008). In particular, there is often a mismatch between the types of algorithms being used and the data structure of modern biosurveillance data. This means that the assumptions behind those algorithms with regards to baseline behavior and outbreak nature are often violated in the modern biosurveillance context. Another important problem is that of multiplicity: when monitoring multiple data sources with multiple streams, using multiple monitoring algorithms, the unavoidable result is a large inflation in false alarm rate. In the case of biosurveillance the implication of excess false alerts outweighs the benefit of an early detection, as the practical result is that public health users ignore alerts altogether. An excess of false alerts usually leads to the ignoring of true alerts, and potentially to deletion of the alerting system altogether. An example is the rocket-alert system in the city of Ashkelon, Israel that was recently disconnected because of five false alarms in April 2008 which led to panic. Thus, when a rocket fell on a shopping mall in Ashkelon the following month, there was no early warning.3\n3\n",

We show that by combining results from multiple algorithms in a way that controls the overall false alert rate, we can actually improve overall performance. The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 describes control charts in general and the limitations of applying them directly to raw modern biosurveillance data. It then describes a preprocessing step that is needed before applying control charts. In Sect. 3 we describe an authentic modern biosurveillance dataset and the simulation of outbreak signatures. Section 4 introduces the notion of model combinations in terms of combining residuals and combining control chart output. Section 5 applies the different combination methods to our data, and we display results showing the improvement in detection performance due to method combination. Section 6 summarizes the main points and results and describes potential enhancements.",

In the following we describe three methods that have been shown to be effective in removing the types of explainable effects that are often exhibited in pre-diagnostic daily count series (day-of-week, holiday, seasonal, and autocorrelation). For a more detailed discussion of preprocessing methods see Lotze et al. (2008) and Lotze and Shmueli (2008). In the following we describe three methods that produce next-day forecasts.

We trim 30% of the long tail, limiting the outbreak horizon to approximately 20 days. This choice of parameters results in a gradually increasing outbreak with a slow fading rate (long tail).

We see that using Shewhart+ increases the true alert rate by approximately 50% compared to Shewhart. Also, the day-of-week residual combination outperforms the alternative preprocessing methods.
