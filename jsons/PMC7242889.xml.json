However, research indicates metabolic pathways such as increased inflammation [8, 9], increased stress on biological systems [10\u201312], oxidative stress [13], systemic aging [14], poor sleep [15, 16], and engagement in unhealthy behaviors might all contribute [17, 18].",

Lewis and colleagues in a review of self-reported discrimination and health suggested social and emotional support as an emerging factor that could act as a \u201cbuffer\u201d from the effects of discrimination on health [24]. Prior research explored different concepts related to social relationships when examining the impact of racial discrimination on health such as seeking support when faced with discrimination, but findings have been mixed, as outlined by Brondolo and colleagues [25]. An important challenge to studying the impact of social relationships is the heterogeneity of concepts and measurements, which range from qualitative assessment of emotional support to quantitative description of social networks [26]. In a study from Finch and colleagues among Latinos in California, discrimination was associated with poor self-rated physical health only among those lacking social support [27]. A study of young African American adults in the rural southern United States indicated that emotional support might reduce the impact of racial discrimination on biological stress-regulation systems [11].",

We also described health outcomes by exposure categories. We conducted bivariate regression analyses of the racial discrimination exposure on the four HrQOL outcomes. The category of having experienced zero domains of racial discrimination was the reference group. Multivariable regressions generated model-adjusted relative risks (RR). Approximately 4% of respondents were excluded from the multivariable models because of a missing value in at least one variable.

As previously described by Williams and colleagues [41], we sought to facilitate understanding of the association between experiencing racial discrimination and health by adjusting for socioeconomic covariates even if those covariates did not technically meet the definition of a confounder. We performed sensitivity analyses for education, employment, material hardship, and health insurance and included in the adjusted model any covariate with a greater than 10% impact on the estimate [42].

Second, measuring racial discrimination is complex and there are ongoing controversies in the field of racial discrimination measurement [24]. Unmeasured personality traits and sociocultural factors influence how one experiences and frames prior experiences related to racial discrimination. Some respondents may minimize experiences of discrimination, whereas others may be hypervigilant. Different race/ethnicity groups might interpret questions related to health-related quality of life or racial discrimination differently. For instance, little is known about whether racial discrimination reported by whites can be compared with racial discrimination reported by non-majority groups. Additionally, older adults were more likely to have lived under institutionalized racial discriminatory practices. However, they reported experiencing fewer experiences of racial discrimination in their lifetime, compared with younger respondents. This result raises possible measurement validity questions regarding how older adults perceive and report events of racial discrimination in their lifetime. This finding might alternatively represent a survival bias where those who experienced more racial discrimination had poorer health and were not included in the survey possibly because of premature mortality or institutionalization. Third, we used broad categories for classifying race/ethnicity, but experiences can vary within groups. For instance, groups within Latinos might experience different levels of discrimination, but our sample size did not allow for further disaggregation [29]. Fourth, our study used a limited assessment of social relationships focused on the frequency of social contact, but did not ascertain quality or function of those relationships. Different domains of social relationships might have different influences on the association between discrimination and health. It is also important to recognize that strained social relationships can in fact undermine health [47]. Lastly, experiences of racial discrimination occur at the intersection of different axes of power and privilege (e.g., sex, economic opportunity, and intergenerational disparities) [48]. All those factors interact in complex ways in the social environment that are difficult to capture in a cross-sectional design.",

Further studies should qualitatively explore how people of different race/ethnicity, age, and economic standing experience, perceive, and report racial discrimination. Additionally, social relationship researchers have indicated that policies supporting social relationships could be construed as preventive medicine [19, 49]. Such policies should also be considered in health equity and anti-racism policy agendas. Possible community interventions would be to create programs geared toward reducing social isolation such as safe spaces within communities where people can congregate and socialize [50, 51]. Social relationships are a social determinant of health and public health departments should consider assessing them in more depth in community health surveys.",
