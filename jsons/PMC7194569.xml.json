When possible, a phone interview to triage patients based on their symptoms and infection exposure status should take place before the patient arrives to the hysteroscopic center. Any woman with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection should be asked not to come to the hysteroscopic center. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection who require immediate evaluation should be directed to COVID-19 designated emergency areas. Once the patient arrives, a thorough history taking regarding potential viral exposure and physical examination must be performed. Consider preoperative universal COVID-19 testing. Only patients with negative COVID-19 test (if performed) and a negative history of symptoms (including body temperature below 37.3 o C) or exposure to COVID-19 should be allowed to enter the unit.3A maximum of ONE adult companion, under the age of 60 years per patient should be allowed access to the unit when absolutely necessary. It is understood that visitor policy may vary at the discretion of each institution guidelines. Children and individuals over the age of 60 years should not be granted access to the unit. Companions will be subjected to the same screening criteria as the patients.4If more than one patient is scheduled to be at the facility at the same time, ensure that the facility provides adequate space to ensure the appropriate social distancing recommendation between patients. Avoid the presence of multiple individuals in the waiting room at any given time. Ensure to space the seating in the waiting room at least 2 meters apart. Hand sanitizers and face masks should be available for patients and companions. We recommend the use of face masks by all individuals present in the hysteroscopic unit (patients, companions and staff members). The masks should always be worn and not only during the hysteroscopic procedure.5It is imperative that all healthcare members in close contact with the patient during the procedure wear personal protective equipment (PPE), which would include an apron and gown, a surgical mask, eye protection and gloves. Extreme caution should be implemented to avoid contamination. Healthcare providers should always wear PPE deemed appropriate by their regulatory institutions following their local and national guidelines during clinical patient interaction.6The use of electrosurgery in hysteroscopy is performed in a liquid environment. Bubbles that are generated with the use of thermal energy devices (monopolar, bipolar or laser) are cooled down rapidly and partly absorbed by the surrounding liquid [17]. Cell fragments generated are contained within the uterine cavity [18]. Any gases volatile at 37\u00b0C or lower and cell fragments are actively suctioned through the outflow channel, in a closed circuit, without aerosol generating effect, minimizing any risk of viral dissemination. In addition, it is recommended to avoid multiple insertion and removal of the hysteroscope from inside the uterine cavity.7The participation of learners and physicians in training should be organized by video transmission and not by physical presence in the office or operating room.8In the case of patients with confirmed positive COVID-19 infection and in need of urgent hysteroscopic surgery, the operation should be performed under strict protective conditions ideally in an operating room with negative pressure and independent ventilation.\n",

Enforcing social distancing and preservation of hospital resources requires suspension of non-essential medical visits. Procedures in which delay could potentially worsen the patient's outcome, must be performed. Adequate triage of patients with potential cancer conditions is critical to ensure patient safety during pandemic infections. Theoretical risk of \u201cviral\u201d dissemination in the operating theater is higher during AGP than in hysteroscopy where the theoretical risk is extremely low, or negligible. Always favor the use of mechanical energy over thermal generating devices. Also, when needed, use conscious sedation or regional anesthesia to avoid the risk of viral dissemination at the time of intubation/extubation. Health care providers must comply with a step by step reimplementation of standard operating procedures, expediting the evaluation and management of all the deferred cases as soon as the benign pathology consultations can be safely restarted. Patients with confirmed negative status for COVID-19 confirmed by PCR, requiring hysteroscopic procedures, should be treated using universal precautions.",
