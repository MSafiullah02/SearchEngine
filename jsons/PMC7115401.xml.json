In Hong Kong, there were approximately 1800 SARS patients with approximately 300 deaths. The consensus document of World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 20%\u201330% of individuals developed severe lung injury, resulting in an overall fatality rate of 15%\u201317% [4], [5].

CD209 (or dendritic cell\u2013specific ICAM-3\u2013grabbing nonintegrin [DC-SIGN]), which shares 77% amino acid identity with CLEC4M [10], [11], was found to interact with the spike (S)\u2013protein of the virus, enhancing pseudotyped SARS-CoV S-protein\u2013driven infection and facilitating viral transmission to susceptible cells [12], [13]. CD209, a C-type lectin expressed on subsets of human dendritic cells (DCs) and alveolar macrophages [10], [14], [15], functions both as a cell-adhesion and as a pathogen-recognition receptor [16]. It has been shown that CD209 as a pathogen-recognition receptor allows DCs to capture and interact with a plethora of pathogens, such as Mycobacterium leprae\n[17], M. tuberculosis\n[18], parasites and other viruses such as HIV-1 [19], Ebola [20], hepatitis C virus (HCV) [21], and Dengue virus [22]. As an adhesion receptor, it plays an important role in many DC functions, such as DC-T cell interaction and DC migration [23], [24].",

Host genetic factors have been shown to result in differences in outcome of the disease. These include the genetic polymorphisms in ACE1\n[26], ICAM3\n[27], MxA\n[28], and Fc\u03b3RIIA\n[29]. In the CD209 promoter region, a putative functional variant \u2212336A>G (dbSNP: rs4804803) affecting a Sp1-like binding site has been described [30]. This promoter SNP was found to affect the transcription activity of CD209 in vitro\n[30]. Moreover, it was found to have significant association with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, M. tuberculosis infection, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type\u20131 infection [31], [32], [33], [34]. For instance, the \u2212336G allele was found to be associated with susceptibility to parenteral but not mucosal for HIV-1 infection in Caucasian individuals, although this finding was not replicated in individuals of African descent [32]. This allele was also found associated with severity of Dengue fever disease in the Thai population [30].",

Our previous association study for SARS-CoV infection showed that the ICAM3 Asp143Gly SNP (+443A>G; dbSNP: rs2304237) demonstrated significant association with higher LDH levels and lower total white blood cell counts on admission [27]. Replacement of a charged aspartate by a neutral glycine of this ICAM3 SNP may affect exposure of an N-linked glycosylation site, possibly affecting interaction between ICAM3 and CD209. In this study, using in vitro competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assay and luciferase promoter activity assay, we confirm the findings reported by Sakuntabhai et al. [30], showing that CD209 promoter \u2212336A>G SNP could affect the binding of nuclear extract proteins and regulate promoter activity. Given our previously observed significant association between the ICAM3 SNP with high standardized LDH levels and low white blood cell (WBC) counts [27], and the functional relationship of ICAM3 with CD209, we hypothesized that the CD209 \u2212336A>G SNP may also show a similar association, and may have a synergistic effect with the ICAM3 SNP.",

Comparison between the mean measurements of patients having wild-type versus the variant genotype was first examined using a Mann\u2013Whitney test. To identify the suitable cut-off point to dichotomize measurement values for statistical analysis, the value of the standardized LDH levels was arranged in ascending order, forming a curve that fit into a polynomial trend line. The cut-off value was taken at the point when the values begin to change exponentially. Cases with standardized LDH levels greater than or equal to the cut-off were categorized as high standardized LDH level, whereas cases with levels less than the cut-off were classified as low standardized LDH level. Allele and genotype distributions of the CD209 SNP in these standardized LDH level groups were assessed using \u03c72 test using SPSS for Windows (Version 13.0), and odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to measure the strength of association.

The up-shifted bands of the hot \u2212336A and \u2212336G probes were competed by the cold \u2212336G probe (lanes 10 and 15) more effectively than by the cold \u2212336A probe (lanes 9 and 16). This suggests that the G allele provides better binding for the nuclear extract proteins than the A allele. The up-shifted band of the hot \u2212336G probe was also competed more effectively by the cold AP2 consensus probe (lanes 14 vs 18) compared with that of the hot \u2212336A probe (lanes 8 vs 12). Similar observations were found for competition with the cold Sp1 consensus probe (lanes 14 vs 17 and lanes 8 vs 11) suggesting that both AP2 and Sp1 proteins bind more effectively to the \u2212336G than the \u2212336A, in keeping with results of competition with cold G and A probes.

As shown in Fig. 2, the standardized LDH data fits a polynomial trend line. The point at which LDH level demonstrates exponential increase is 1.6, which was taken as the cut-off value to divide the patients into lower LDH and higher standardized LDH level subgroups. The distribution of CD209 \u2212336A>G of SARS patients into higher standardized LDH level subgroup (\u22651.6) and lower standardized LDH level subgroup (<1.6) is presented in Table 1. In the higher standardized LDH level group, there is no patient with \u2212336GG genotype. The frequency of \u2212336G-positive genotype in the lower standardized LDH level subgroup (18.46%) is significantly higher than that in higher standardized LDH level subgroup (8.3%) (p = 0.014, OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.19\u20130.85); the CD209 \u2212336G allele was overrepresented in the lower standardized LDH levels subgroup (9.5%) compared with the higher standardized LDH levels subgroup (4.2%) (p = 0.015, OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.20\u20130.86). These results suggest that patients with \u2212336G-positive genotype have a 2.5-fold greater chance of having lower LDH levels. The exclusion of genetically related subjects with logistic regression analysis taking into account patients' age and gender, showed no significant effect on our association findings (Supplementary Table 1), supporting the notion that these factors at least did not contribute to population stratification.",

The wild-type genotypes of both SNPs were combined as the wild-type +443AA/\u2212336AA group. Analysis of the mean standardized LDH level on admission of the combined genotypes showed that patients with the combined genotype +443GG/\u2212336AA had the highest standardized LDH levels (Fig. 3), with significant difference in standardized LDH levels when compared with patients with the wild-type +443AA/\u2212336AA genotype (p = 0.033). The frequency of patients in lower and higher standardized LDH subgroups for each combined genotype was compared, using the wildtype +443AA/\u2212336AA genotype as reference (Table 2). Overall analysis showed the combined genotypes distribution was significantly different between these two groups (p = 0.024). Compared with the wild type combined +443AA/\u2212336AA genotype, the combined +443GG/AA genotype was significantly associated with higher LDH (p = 0.021, OR = 4.34, 95% CI = 1.34\u201314.12).

The overall mean of standardized LDH levels for the \u2212336G-positive group (1.03 \u00b1 0.04) was around the upper limit of the normal range, in contrast to the \u2212336 G-negative group (1.14 \u00b1 0.03), which was 14% above the upper limit of the normal physiologic range. Such 14% excess of physiologic reference levels most likely carries biologic significance. Increase in serum LDH activity is postulated to be a result of massive tissue destruction related to immune hyperactivity during the acute phase of SARS-CoV infection [38].

The present study found the homozygote wild-type (or \u2212336G-negative genotype) of the CD209 \u2212336A>G SNP was associated with higher standardized LDH levels on admission. Combined genotype analysis of CD209 \u2212336A>G and ICAM3 +443A>G showed that the overall combined genotypes was significantly associated with LDH levels, with the +443GG/\u2212336AA genotype having significantly highest standardized LDH levels. Patients with this +443GG/\u2212336AA genotype had a 4.34-fold increased risk for higher standardized LDH levels on admission. Although the combined analysis gave statistically significant results, results from multivariate logistic regression analysis failed to demonstrate a synergistic effect between the two SNPs. The physical locations of CD209 and ICAM3, >2.5Mb apart on chromosome 19q13, and the high recombination rate within this region (obtained from HapMap http://www.hapmap.org), suggest that the loci of these two SNPs are highly independent.",

Our genetic association study showed that the \u2212336A>G variant of CD209 was associated with higher standardized LDH levels on admission which is an independent prognostic indicator for SARS, suggesting that the \u2212336A>G polymorphism of CD209 may influence the outcome of SARS infection. This functional SNP may alter the CD209 gene expression thus altering host immune response. The relevance of this finding in relation to other infectious diseases or inflammatory conditions would be worth investigation.",
