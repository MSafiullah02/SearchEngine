Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), rotaviruses, coronaviruses and Cryptosporidium spp. represent the four most prevalent infectious causes of calf diarrhoea, all over the world [2], [3]. Two of them, Cryptosporidium spp. and rotaviruses, are the most commonly found causes in cases of diarrhoeic faecal samples [3], [4]. In Greece, cryptosporidiosis plays an important role in NCD (among dairy cattle farms) and poses a significant public health issue [5].",

This difference can be explained by the fact that these countries implicate more modern management strategies than Greece. Previous studies conducted in Greece by Panousis et al. [5] reported a 25.05% prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. among different aged (calves and cows) groups of animals and a 48.62% infection with Cryptosporidium spp. in young calves aged less than 14 days. Moreover, statistical analysis revealed that the number of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts was strongly correlated with high percentage (55%) of diarrhoeic faeces (FS 2 and 3) among neonatal calves, leading to high percentages of morbidity and mortality. Torsein et al. [17] found that farms with high mortality among young calves have higher prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. shedding than farms with low mortality.

Calves born to vaccinated dams against those pathogens also shed less C. parvum oocysts [4]. The lower shedding of this protozoan (C. parvum) oocysts reflects a generally higher standard of management practices in these herds, rather than a direct protective effect. On the other hand, these enteropathogens can be also isolated in faecal samples from healthy calves, thus their presence may not be always the main cause of diarrhoea [3]. Nevertheless, all pregnant cows (one month before parturition) in our study were vaccinated against rotavirus, coronavirus and Escherichia coli K99 (Rotavec Corona\u00ae, MSD) in order to minimize any possible adverse effect of other pathogens than Cryptosporidium spp.",

At the same time, the average amount of the consumed colostrum by the neonatal calves was 5.25 liters, at the first day of their life. It is obvious that the higher consumed colostrum, leading to adequate passive transfer, reduced the number of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts in faecal samples. Unfortunately, only 8.9% of the standard deviation regarding Cryptosporidium spp. number can be interpreted due to the CQT consumed by neonatal calves. Thus, other factors additionally to CQT may influence Cryptosporidium spp. shedding through faeces. In accordance with our results, Trotz-Williams et al. [28] proposed that the early separation of calves from their dams and feeding an increased volume of colostrum within 6 h of birth is significantly associated with a reduced risk of failure of passive transfer [28] and thus, an enhanced immune system.",

In a different study, Vasseur et al.
