In a period when the shortage in diagnostic kits in China occurred, the Chinese health institutions resorted to diagnosing COVID-19 in patients based on clinical symptoms alone, which resulted in a major peak in the reported cases on 12 February 2020 [7] . Because clinical symptoms for COVID-19 are sometimes non-specific (cough, mild fever, sore throat, fatigue), similar to other respiratory diseases or even absent despite infection [8, 9] , molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 [9] is necessary for a more accurate diagnosis.

While in the context of this study, the SensiFAST SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay gave acceptable results on non-purified material, the assay using the RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kit 1.0 seemed to be inhibited by such minimally-processed samples. Due to differences between RT-qPCR assays, we recommend that all RT-qPCR assays used together with the heat-processing workflow should be validated before being implemented in clinical diagnostics. We also underline that heating the oropharyngeal swabs for 5 min at 98 \u00b0C followed by cooling for 2 min at 4 \u00b0C before a SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR reaction is not as sensitive or accurate as RT-qPCR reactions performed on purified samples. Even though we do not find a considerable difference between the Ct-values for the heat-processed samples and the NA extracted samples, we cannot rule out the possibility of RNA degradation during heating. This simplified heat-approach should not be for general use but only if the gold standard approaches are not available. This is the case now, where reagents for NA purification are limited due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Simply heating the samples could serve as an easy, fast and inexpensive alternative to chemical extraction kits, which would detect 97.4% of the COVID-19-positive patients with no false positives; however, there might be a small risk of false negatives, which could be minimised by performing the assay in duplicates.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Exemption for review by the ethical committee system and informed consent was given by the Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics -Capital region in accordance with Danish law on assay development projects.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ethical statement"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.Geneva: WHO; Updated 23", "authors": [], "year": 2020, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Frequently Asked Questions on COVID-19 Testing at Laboratories.
