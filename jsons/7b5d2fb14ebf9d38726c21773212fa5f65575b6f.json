Many attempts have been devoted to modeling the dynamics of new infection rates, death rates, and the impact of the disease on health systems and the world economy. Most of these modeling concepts use the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental models; however, wide imprecise outcomes in forecasting can occur with these models in the context of poor data, low testing levels, and a nonhomogeneous population. : medRxiv preprint",

Our model suggests that the current level of mitigation seen in S\u00e3o Paulo is sufficient to reach R t < 1, thus attaining a \"peak\" in the short term. In S\u00e3o Paulo state, the total number of deaths is estimated to be around 9,000 (median) with the 2.5% quantile being 6,600 deaths and the 97.5% quantile being around 13,350 deaths.

            "text": "number, represents the average number of people who will be infected from a sick patient [8] . Curiously, data for these two variables from the literature followed two patterns. Data from the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic suggested a longer serial interval, of about 7.5 days [9] , which was the same order of magnitude as that of SARS (8.4 days) [10] . However, all articles and publications subsequent to this phase in early 2020 found shorter intervals, which is consistent with the practical evolution of the disease in practically all affected countries. Therefore, we chose to incorporate the most current data compatible with reality into the model and to disregard the findings from the beginning of the epidemic. Conceptually, when the serial interval number is less than the estimated disease incubation period, in practice the transmission by presymptomatic patients is more frequent. As it is known that a large portion of infected people can be asymptomatic [11] and, therefore, silent transmitters of the disease, isolation of only symptomatic patients is an ineffective strategy for controlling the epidemic; thus, social isolation is mandatory. Using Nishiura et al. [7] as a basis, we take the median serial range to be 4 and the mean serial range to be 4.7. These values are consistent with those found by other researchers [12, 13] . R 0 values in the literature vary between 2.2 and 6.47 [9, 14, 15, 16, 17] . We chose to adopt the values found by Liu et al [18] in a systematic literature review: an average R 0 of 3.28 and a median R 0 of 2.71. It is known that the virus transmission capacity depends on the viral load, and it is also possible that the virulence of the disease is related to the amount of viral particles inhaled over time [19] . Furthermore, seriously ill patients continue to transmit the disease indefinitely, even after the presence of IgG in the blood [20] . Our modeling efforts try to incorporate these different scenarios. We adopted the following premises: (1) Asymptomatic patients transmit the virus for a period between 6 and 10 days; oligosymptomatic patients transmit the virus for up to 14 days [9] ; and seriously ill patients transmit for up to 4 weeks, but we consider 10 days for these patients as they will be isolated in an ICU. (2) The virus incubation time is the variable with the least variability among authors: 5.2 days according to Li et al. [9] , 5.1 days according to Zhang et al., [13] and 3 to 7.2 days according to Yang et al. [21] (3) Of the main risk factors, without a doubt, the most clinically important is age. Mortality after 62 to 65 years becomes extremely significant [22, 23] , with about 90% of deaths occurring in this age group. In a recent systematic review of the literature by Ioannidis et al. [22] , fewer than 10% of those who died were under the age of 65, and fewer than 1% percent of deaths occurred in those under 40. Only 4%-9% : of deaths occurred in those who are between the ages of 40 and 65. (4) Men are 2 to 3 times more likely to die. (5) Hypertension [23] and obesity [24] are significant risk factors, among others [25] . Due to these factors and the known presence of a large number of asymptomatic people seen in countries whose public health policies have facilitated the testing of a large portion of the population [26] , we added to the model a correction factor that modifies the chance of death as described by Ioannidis et al. [22] . In this correction factor, we consider a gradual change in the number of asymptomatic patients that is in inverse proportion to their age. Regarding the timing of disease progression, we consider the time from onset of symptoms to admission to ICU to be 3 to 7 days, and the time between onset of symptoms and death to be about 3 weeks. We assume that 9% of symptomatic cases need admission to the ICU and that 25% of those ICU patients die (Grasselli et al. [23] ). We also add that the average age of patients admitted to the ICU is similar to the average age of people who died (64 years old), and the median of the Kaplan-Meier curve is 25 days for patients admitted to the ICU [21] . Other factors that can be extremely relevant but lack proof of cause and effect as they are eminently associative are seasonality [27] and the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine [28, 29] . BCG is a vaccine used against tuberculosis, and according to the distribution of this disease, the countries that mostly use the vaccine are developing countries like Brazil. There is an important association, of the order of ten times, between vaccination coverage and number of fatal cases by COVID-19 [28, 29] . However, the data are associative and the level of evidence is weak; thus, it is impossible to establish a causal relationship. Considering that there is a biological plausibility that justifies partial coverage against coronavirus by an indirect effect, and given the magnitude of the finding, we chose to include it in the model, giving this vaccine the benefit of the doubt. If it does not have a protective effect, the pessimistic scenario does not change, but the lack of effect will be observed when examining the optimistic scenario. The effects of climate and temperature could also affect the transmission capacity of the virus, because the viability of the virus seems to be influenced by sunlight, temperature, and humidity. Similarly, it is extremely common to have seasonal characteristics in the incidence of colds, and the coronavirus is influenced by season [27] .",

In contrast, we find that the values fed in the model (serial range and R 0 ) come from countries that were in theoretically favorable seasonality. We hypothesize, therefore, that if seasonality is of great importance in our environment, there will be no worsening beyond the more pessimistic scenario. Otherwise, there would be a non-accentuated increase in the mortality curve.",

During this period, even though the number of reported cases is not very reliable due to undernotifications, its trend is useful and that is what we are using. For t = t * * + 1, . . . we use the reported deaths to estimate R t following the same approach we used for the reported cases. We expect the reported deaths to be more reliable, but the figures are usually very similar. We considered windows varying from 1 to 3 weeks for calibration. Typically, the best choice was among the window with 2 weeks, or an average between the estimated R t,R between 2 and 3 weeks. Shorter windows obtain instantaneous changes, but suffers from noise, longer windows are smoother and capture longer trends, but may miss changes in trends.

            "text": "Other mathematical models have been developed to predict the evolution of COVID-19 [41, 42, 34, 43] . As COVID-19 is a new disease, there is a great degree of uncertainty regarding its epidemiological variables [44] . The study by Ferguson et al. [34] assumed that 50% of the infected individuals could be asymptomatic. Recent evidence shows the possibility of a greater number of asymptomatic patients [44, 45, 26, 11] . Thus, we created a correction factor to the table described by Verity et al. [31] based on the work of Ioannidis et al. [22] and adapted it for the relative risk of ICU-level care and death according to age and asymptomatic percentage. As the infection fatality rate (IFR) is a variable of great uncertainty, we include it in the model with a coefficient to mitigate its inaccuracy. As discussed below, an unknown lethality will not significantly affect the main objective of our study. Some epidemiological models of the late 2000s also failed to predict the evolution of H1N1 for the same reason-that it is necessary to know variables that are still uncertain at the beginning of an epidemic [46, 47] . Interestingly, the IFR values at that time were similar to those described today for COVID-19. Several years passed before we discovered that the H1N1 IFR is about 0.02% [48] . Due to the factors described above, in addition to the characteristics inherent to the model itself, we obtained a lower death result compared to the models previously described (about 10 \u22122 for the population). Even though the lethality of COVID-19 is almost five times greater than that H1N1 (based on our assumptions), the lethality in the Brazilian population will still be of the magnitude described above. COVID-19's IFR increases exponentially with age [8, 32, 23, 31] . The average age of the deaths in Italy was 80 years, for example [49] . So, considering our age pyramid with a much larger base than European and North American pyramids, and considering the lower risk of death due to recent evidence of a large number of asymptomatic individuals, we estimate the Brazilian IFR to be on the order of magnitude described above. The mathematical model used in our study is based on an adaptive Bayesian technique that is based on the death toll, which we believe is the most reliable data we currently have in Brazil. The model is adjusted using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm. The model has very different characteristics compared to other models previously used, as we use it oppositely from other models by providing the number of deaths as input. Considering symptomatic individuals, we know their chances of hospitalization, ICU treatment, and death [32, 23, 25] . Inexact knowledge of IFR will not change the outcome of the main objective of our study: to estimate the number of ICU beds needed over time. We consider this the most important variable in terms of public health, as it is possible to control with social isolation in order to save lives. One possible criticism would be that we did not limit the study to just achieving herd immunity. It is not our goal to try to predict the total number of deaths at the end of the epidemic, but to help predict how many ICU beds would be needed over time. After the peak of deaths, we can see that there is a sharp drop in the curve. When the R t is less than 1 (that is, the time when 1 person infects less than 1 person), the curve no longer grows and the epidemic is controlled naturally. From that point onward, there is a marked decrease in the number of infected. As our population is in social isolation, the acute control of the epidemic would take place in this scenario. When the scenario changes, a further increase in the number of deaths is obviously expected. The magnitude of this increase will depend on how effective isolation is in controlling the disease. After the death rate peaks and there is a gradual loosening of isolation, we can envision either an optimistic scenario, in which the number of asymptomatic patients is higher than expected and the epidemic curve will tend to a more \"endemic\" characteristic (if the lethality is even lower than expected), or a pessimistic scenario, with a new peak of infection and deaths. At the end of this first stage of the epidemic, we estimated the number of deaths to be about 10 times lower than that from Imperial College's publication [50] . Compartmental models are more sensitive to IFR than our model and can have the effect of overestimating the result. If our premises, model, and consequently results are correct, after the peak of the epidemic in early May, an estimated 10% to 15% of the population will be already immunized. Another premise established by Ferguson et al. [34] is contact transmission. New evidence suggests transmission through the air without the need for contact [51] . We also included in the model ecological data (BCG vaccination and seasonality). For public health purposes, we consider that the lethality of the disease in a person who needs ICU care but does not receive it is 100%. As the average ICU stay is two weeks [23] , ICU beds can quickly become unavailable. When we note that the peak need estimate for ICU beds is between late April and early May, after that peak (and if the number of deaths remains within our confidence interval), we could loosen the need for social isolation with well-established criteria and monitor whether more deaths are predicted beyond the capacity of ICU beds. By feeding our evolutionary curve with real data, we are able to monitor the epidemic's evolution in real time. The daily routine has shown that our proposed model should behave in a more consistent manner with reality, bringing more realistic numbers to our country. We therefore offer an instrument that helps to predict the peak of deaths from the disease and, consequently, the need for ICU beds. According to the current scenario in terms of population isolation, there should be enough ICU beds in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo to face the epidemic. The situation may be more fearful, however, in other parts of the country where social inequality and the difference in health structure observed in Brazil would present a problem in facing the epidemic. We adapted our results according to these regions and will offer technical support to government officials according to different scenarios.",
