            "text": "Within years after its first discovery in Asia in the early 1990s, the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) developed into an epizootic disease. WSSV is currently found in most crustacean farming areas in the world, where it causes large economic losses to the aquaculture industry. Aside from its economic effect, the disease also poses a threat to natural marine and freshwater ecology (Jiravanichpaisal et al, 2004, Nambi et al, 2012). As such, understanding the molecular mechanism of the innate immune defense against virus infection is imperative. Recent studies have demonstrated that the small GTPases found in shrimp participate in antiviral immunity by regulating phagocytosis (Liu et al, 2009, Wu et al, 2007). In Drosophila S2 cells (Schneider line 2), Ran protein, a small Ras-like GTPase, was involved in the regulation of phagocytosis against Drosophila C virus (DCV). Some members of the ADP ribosylation factors (Arfs) found in mammals (D'Souza-Schorey, Chavrier, 2006, Nie et al, 2003) and the shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicas (Ma et al, 2010, Wang et al, 2009, Zhang et al, 2010), which are classified with small GTP-binding proteins (~21 kDa), are involved in virus infection. The relationship between various Arfs and virus invasion is thus worth investigating.",

The six mammalian Arfs are divided into three classes based on their amino-acid identity. Class I contains Arf1, Arf2, and Arf3; class II contains Arf4 and Arf5; and class III contains only Arf6. Class I and class II Arfs are mainly concentrated in the Golgi apparatus, although they also function in endosomal compartments. By contrast, Arf6 is primarily localized in the plasma membrane and is a subset of the endosomes. A large body of evidence indicates that Arfs promote the biogenesis of carrier vesicles by nucleating the assembly of coat protein complexes in the sites of vesicle formation (Cheung et al, 2014, Myers, Casanova, 2008). However, different Arfs seem to possess various intracellular localizations and functions, which depend on the specific membrane they bind according to their recruitment of diverse groups of proteins. Such specificities can be defined by determining which regulators of Arfs, GEFs (guanine nucleotide-exchange factors), and GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins) function with which Arf proteins (Donaldson, Honda, 2005, Sun et al, 2011). The binding of Arfs to membranes appears to be essential for viral replication (Belov et al., 2007a), and they cycle between GTP- and GDP-bound states. In the former cycle, the activated form Arf-GTP is bound to the membrane; in the latter cycle, Arf-GDP is released by the cellular GTPase activity into the cytoplasm.",

            "text": "During the evolutionary interplay between virus infection and host defense, the Arf-dependent secretion pathway may be involved in anti-virus action through secretion of interferons and presentation of viral antigens by MHC I (Ma et al, 2010, Molla et al, 1991). The pathway of secretion or endocytic can easily be made to cause viral immune evasion and virus propagation, and Arfs can be recruited to the specific target membrane to induce disintegration of intracellular membranes and formation of specific vesicles by viral proteins mediating their interactors (Belov et al., 2007b). Arf1 was reported to have important roles in the regulation of viral RNA replication and the production of infectious hepatitis C virus (HCV), a kind of plus-strand RNA virus (Matto et al., 2011). GBF1, a kind of Arf GEFs, was crucial for the RNA replication of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) (Lanke et al., 2009). In addition to the function in the viral RNA replication, class II Arf proteins (Arf4 and Arf5) played important roles in the secretion of dengue virus (DENV) (Kudelko et al., 2012). Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) replication was dependent on the GBF1-mediated Arf1 activation (Verheije et al., 2008). The replication of plant RNA virus also needed the participation of Arf1 (Hyodo et al., 2013). The previous research showed that Arfs were related to RNA virus replication and secretion; however, the relationship between Arfs and DNA virus infection was rarely reported. WSSV is a double stranded DNA virus and MjArf4 from M. japonicus was significantly up-regulated with the propagation of WSSV (Zhang et al., 2010). The relatively low expression level of MjArfn in WSSV-resistant shrimp may suggest its roles in WSSV invasion (Ma et al., 2010).",

The prawns were acclimatized in freshwater tanks under laboratory conditions at room temperature (25 \u00b0C). The prawns were divided into a control group and an experimental group designated as WSSV-challenged group. The WSSV inoculum was prepared following the previous paper (Wu et al., 2007). In brief, it was extracted from virus-infected M. japonicus by homogenizing muscle in TN buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 400 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Then the tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 2000\u00d7 g for 10 min. The supernatant was diluted 100 times with 0.9% NaCl and was subsequently filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m filter. About 100 \u00b5L of filtrate (105 WSSV copies/mL) was injected into the lateral area of the fourth abdominal segment of the prawns using a syringe with 29-gauge needle. The hepatopancreas and gills of the prawns challenged with WSSV at 0, 24, and 48 h (3 prawns at each time) were collected for RNA extraction. Tissues (i.e., heart, hepatopancreas, gills, stomach, and intestine) were also collected for RNA extraction.",

The transcription level was significantly higher in the hepatopancreas than in the others (Supplement 4A). MrArf2 was only highly expressed in the hepatopancreas (Supplement 4B). MjArf1, MjArfn, and MjArf4 are all extensively expressed genes (Ma et al, 2010, Zhang et al, 2010). The characterization of the high conservation of protein sequences of shrimp Arfs and their constitutive and widespread expression in tissues may indicate that shrimp Arfs have important roles.",

The results displayed a distinguished up-regulation of MrArf1 and MrArf2 post WSSV challenge, demonstrating that MrArf1 and MrArf2 can significantly be triggered by WSSV infection. Specific evidence was also presented to verify our hypothesis that MrArf1 and MrArf2 have a pivotal function in WSSV-related prawn innate immunity. However, MrArf1 and MrArf2 transcription patterns were distinct from those of Arf1, Arf4, and Arfn in the hepatopancreas of M. japonicus, which were up-regulated and quickly reached the highest level only 6 h after infection. In our study, MrArf1 reached the maximal level 48 h after infection (Fig. 1A and 1C\n). The MrArf2 transcript in the gills was significantly down-regulated at first 24 h after infection (Fig. 1B) but up-regulated and reached the highest value at 48 h. In hepatopancreas, the MrArf2 was significantly up-regulated at 24 h after infection (Fig. 1D). These findings are consistent with the transcriptional tendency of Mjcent, the Arf6 GAP of M. japonicus (Wang et al., 2009). In the previous research, it was found that Arf1s and GBF1 were involved in the RNA virus replication and secretion (Kudelko et al, 2012, Matto et al, 2011, Verheije et al, 2008).",

The results showed that MrArf1 and MrArf2 were knocked down in gills after MrArf1 and MrArf2 dsRNA were injected into the prawns (Fig. 2A and 2B\n) and the envelope protein gene vp28 of the WSSV was obviously inhibited compared with the normal (untreated) control and the dsGFP injection group (Fig. 2C). Enterovirus 71 RNA replication was dependent on the activity of Class I Arfs and depletion of Arf1 and Arf3 inhibited viral replication in cells (Wang et al., 2014). In plants, RNA virus replication also needed the participation of Arf1 (Hyodo et al., 2013). Both the levels of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA and the production of infectious viral particles was downregulated when Arf1 expression was inhibited by small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Matto et al., 2011). Simultaneous depletion of class II Arf (Arf4 and Arf5) blocked dengue flavivirus secretion (Kudelko et al., 2012). The roles of Arfs in DNA virus infection was less reported. Centaurin-\u03b11 is a shrimp GTPase activating protein (GAP) of Arf6 and it notably decreased in WSSV-resistant shrimps (Wang et al., 2009). Other member of Rab family, such as Rab27a, is required for human cytomegalovirus assembly (Fraile-Ramos et al., 2010). So, it could be speculated that MrArf1 and MrArf2 (members of Rab family) might play important roles in the innate immune system against WSSV infection.",
