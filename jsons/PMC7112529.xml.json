With these applications, the potential dangers of the compounds to human health and environment are concerned. TiO2 photocatalysts applied in water disinfection process were noticeable, which provided an alternative to conventional chemical germicides [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. However, this technology requires a relatively complex device and photo energy. Recently, we have reported the inactivation efficiency of Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 to SARS coronavirus, bacteria and yeast [6]. The microbes are completely inactivated in 5 min on Ag/Al2O3 surface at room temperature in air, and we suggest a catalytic oxidation mechanism in this disinfection process.",

After Al2O3 powder was introduced into an appropriate amount of silver nitrate aqueous solution, the mixture was stirred at room temperature. As for AgCl/Al2O3, an appropriate amount of ammonium chloride aqueous solution was added into the mixture at a rate of 0.5 ml/min, while the Ag/Al2O3 need not this step. Both of the wet samples were dried at 120 \u00b0C for 12 h, and then calcined in air at 600 \u00b0C for 3 h [11]. Before using, Al2O3, Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3 powders were pressed into wafers of ca. 20 mg/cm2. XRD is used to investigate the silver phase on \u03b3-Al2O3. In the case of Ag/Al2O3, only the \u03b3-Al2O3 phase was detected when the silver loading was 5 wt%, and the absence of diffraction lines of silver phase on 5 wt% Ag/Al2O3 catalyst indicates that silver is at a very high dispersion degree. To 5 wt% AgCl/Al2O3, however, the peaks attributable to AgCl phase was observed at 2\u03b8 of 27.76\u00b0, 32.24\u00b0, 55.86\u00b0, 57.34\u00b0 and 76.54\u00b0 (PDF-ICDD 85-1355, PDF-ICDD 31-1238). The absence of diffraction lines of silver phase on 5 wt% Ag/Al2O3 catalyst indicates that silver is at a very high dispersion degree. TEM was also used to investigate the silver phase on \u03b3-Al2O3. As for 5 wt% Ag/Al2O3, the silver particle (ranging from 15 to 20 nm) at a very high dispersion degree was observed. In the case of 5 wt% AgCl/Al2O3, the silver particle was greater than that of 5 wt% Ag/Al2O3 (ranging from 20 to 50 nm).",

Before SEM measurement, the E. coli on the wafers were fixed with glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide, drained with ethanol/water with the concentrations of ethanol increasing. The absolute ethanol was replaced by dimethoxymethane, and the samples underwent critical point drying with CO2. The wafers were glued onto stages with conductive silver and metallized with gold.

After E. coli suspension and catalyst powder were mixed completely, the mixed sample was placed in a ceramic crucible in the in situ chamber. Total carbon (TC) content of mixture of E. coli and catalysts is determined using Apollo 9000 Analyzer (Terkmar Dohmann) during the bactericidal process. It was observed that TC decreased during the catalytic oxidation process, which implied that TC of E. coli had converted to CO2 and released from the catalysts. The formation of CO2 during this process can be calculated using the following equation:formationofCO2/%=TC0-TCiTC0\u00d7100%,where TC0 signifies initial TC and TCi is TC at different times during this process.",

Some cells collapsed and led to release of intracellular constituents, however, their membrane and intracellular constituents covered the surface even after 24 h. Fig. 2c\u2013e and f\u2013h show the SEM images of E. coli adhered on AgCl/Al2O3 and Ag/Al2O3 at room temperature for 0.5 min, 0.5 and 1 h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, it is obvious that Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3 gave a higher bactericidal effect on E. coli than Al2O3. Although AgCl/Al2O3 exhibited a similar bactericidal ability comparing with Ag/Al2O3, the SEM images indicate that different mechanisms are involved in the bactericidal action of AgCl/Al2O3 and Ag/Al2O3. The cell membrane damage mainly started at one end of E. coli on the surface of AgCl/Al2O3 (Fig. 2c), and intracellular constituents were released from the damaged site. After exposure time of 0.5 h, the cell was further spoiled (Fig. 2d). After 1 h, the clean catalyst surface reappeared (Fig. 2e). The damage of bacteria on the surface of Ag/Al2O3 was more serious than that of AgCl/Al2O3 (Fig. 2f\u2013h). Even though after 30 s on AgCl/Al2O3, a great deal of intracellular constituents spouted from damaged sites on the cell membrane (Fig. 2f).

During the process of the E. coli suspension contacted with Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3, Ag+ released unavoidablely. In order to confirm the bactericidal effect of Ag+, the catalyst wafers were dip in sterile water for 10 min and the quantitative analysis of Ag+ in the eluate was carried out with an atomic adsorption spectrophotometer. The bactericidal effect of a series of AgNO3 (10\u22129, 10\u22128, 10\u22125, 10\u22124, 10\u22123\n M) contacting with E. coli suspension for 10 min were determined. The correlation between the concentration of Ag+ and the quantity of survival cells was reflected in a curve, so the effect of Ag+ released from the catalyst can be confirmed. As shown in Fig. 3\n, the colony-forming ability of E. coli lost in Ag+ containing solution when the concentration of Ag+ is more than 10\u22124\n M. The concentrations of Ag+ eluted from Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3 were less than 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22124\n M and 4.7 \u00d7 10\u22127\n M under such experimental conditions, respectively. According to this result, Ag+ was released from the catalysts, and the bactericidal ability of the Ag/Al2O3 would be related to the amount of Ag+ dissolved in a certain extent. However the amount of Ag+ eluted from AgCl/Al2O3 is too little to cause any bactericidal effect against E. coli.",

This investigation was performed to obtain information about the role of oxygen in the bactericidal activity of Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3. 0.5 g Al2O3, Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3 powder was added into 40 ml sterilized water respectively, and then the aerobic and anaerobic condition was achieved by oxygen and nitrogen gas bubbling for 40 min before piping the bacteria into the system. The bubbling was continued throughout the treatment period. The bactericidal activity of Al2O3 under the same condition was studied as the control experiment. The results are shown in Fig. 4\n. Under the anaerobic condition, the bactericidal activity of Ag/Al2O3 sharply decreased compared to that in the aerobic condition. Though the bactericidal activity of AgCl/Al2O3 was lower than Ag/Al2O3, it can also be obviously observed that the bactericidal activity in aerobic condition is better than that in anaerobic condition. These results suggest that nitrogen gas bubbling drastically suppresses the bactericidal activity of Ag/Al2O3, and indicate that the presence of oxygen is necessary for the bactericidal activity by Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3.",

The ROS might contain superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. SOD is a scavenger for superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals. The effect of addition of SOD on the bactericidal activity was investigated (Fig. 5\n). Compared with the situation without SOD, in the presence of SOD, the bacterial survival apparently increased on the surface of Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3, respectively. The addition of 100 unit/ml SOD drastically suppressed the bactericidal activity. The survival bacterial was kept more than 1 \u00d7 106 CFU/ml when 100 unit/ml of SOD added (The survival bacteria were less than 5 \u00d7 105 CFU/ml when 50 unit/ml of SOD added).

Relying on SEM investigation, the different bactericidal mechanisms were identified on the surfaces of Ag/Al2O3 and AgCl/Al2O3. The role of Ag+ eluted from AgCl/Al2O3 can be ignored in our experiments. Oxygen, which can be activated to ROS by catalyst, is essential for the expression of bactericidal activity. The strong catalytic oxidation ability was expressed on the Ag/Al2O3 surface, and CO2 as the ultimate product was observed during the bactericidal process.
