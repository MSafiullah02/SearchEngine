            "text": "The establishment of a reverse genetic system forfeline coronaviruses (FCoVs), which allows to modify the entire coronaviral genome, was successfully achieved for the first time in 2008 [1]. This system relies on vaccinia virus, which serves as a cloning vector for the full-length FCoV cDNA. The very first vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system was developed for the human coronavirus (HCoV) 229 E [2] and since then it has been successfully applied for other coronaviruses, e.g., infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [3] or mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [4]. The major advantage of the vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system lies in the stable integration of full-length corona viral cDNAs into the vaccinia virus genome. In contrast, other conventional cloning techniques often are not suitable for the accommodation of large coronaviral cDNA inserts due to instability of the plasmids caused by certain coronaviral sequences. However, reverse genetic systems, which are based on different techniques other than vaccinia virus, have been developed and used successfully for the generation of various recombinant coronaviruses [5\u201311].",

Therefore, this part of the genome should be introduced into the vaccinia virus genome by vaccinia virus-mediated homologous recombination in the second step as described in section \u201cCompletion of the FCoV cDNA Using Vaccinia Virus-Mediated Homologous Recombination\u201d.Analyze the remaining parts of the FCoV sequence (1\u20135000 and 15,000\u201329,000 nt) and choose restriction enzyme sites encoded by the FCoV genome that will allow the in vitro ligation of cloned cDNA inserts. After the analysis, prepare a set of plasmids (no more than 4\u20135) covering the FCoV genome from nt 1 to 5000 and from nt 15,000 to 29,000 (Fig. 1a).\nPlasmid A (pA) contains upstream of the FCoV sequence a Bsp120I site followed by a T7 promoter and a G nucleotide. The Bsp120I site is required for the ligation of the cDNA insert derived from pA with the NotI digested vaccinia virus DNA (section \u201cLarge-Scale Vaccinia Virus DNA Preparation\u201d).The T7 promoter for the T7 RNA polymerase enables the generation of full-length FCoV RNA via in vitro transcription (IVT) (Sect. 3.3.1). The presence of the G nucleotide is recommended for the proper initiation of the T7 polymerase. Furthermore, plasmid D (pD) should contain downstream of the FCoV 3\u2032UTR 20\u201330 A nucleotides, which will serve as a synthetic poly-A tail after IVT. These A nucleotides should be followed by a unique cleavage site (e.g., ClaI), the hepatitis delta ribozyme (HDR) sequence, and a Bsp120I cleavage site (Fig. 1a). The digestion of the vaccinia virus DNA with the unique restriction enzyme will enable to terminate the T7 polymerase driven RNA synthesis (Sect. 3.3.1). The HDR sequence fulfills the same function and contributes to the termination of the FCoV RNA. The Bsp120I enables the in vitro ligation of the cDNA insert originating from pDinto the NotI cleaved vaccinia virus DNA (section \u201cLarge-Scale Vaccinia Virus DNA Preparation\u201d).\n",

Isolate the fragments using standard gel extraction kit (see\nNote\n1).Set up an in vitro ligation reaction (total volume 20\u201330 \u03bcl) with all of the fragments in the presence of a high-concentrated T4 DNA ligase overnight at room temperature.Analyze the efficiency of your ligation on an agarose gel after heating up the samples for 5\u201310 min at 65 \u00b0C.

Harvest the fully infected cells 2\u20133 days post infection.Pellet the cells at 2000 RPM (4 \u00b0C, 3 min).Resuspend the cell pellet in 3 ml of chilled 1\u00d7 buffer A and fill three MagNaLyser Green Beads with 1 ml suspension each.Homogenize the cells with the MagNaLyser Instrument (Roche) at 5000 RPM for 20 s.Spin the beads for 1\u20132 min at 2000 RPM (4 \u00b0C).Collect the supernatant from the three tubes and combine it into a new tube.Digest the content of the new tube with RNase-free DNase (5U) for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C to degrade the remaining cellular DNA in the reaction.

Within the virions the vaccinia virus DNA is protected from this digestion step.Inactivate the DNase by adding 20 mM EDTA and incubate the reaction for 20 min at 65 \u00b0C.Proceed with trypsin digestion as follows: 0.1 volume of 0.25 % (w/v) trypsin for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C.Fill up the reaction volume to 11 ml with chilled 1\u00d7 buffer A and overlay it on 25 ml 36 % (w/v) sucrose cushion in a 36 ml ultracentrifuge tube.

We experienced that exposing the DNA to UV-light can hamper the ligation of these fragments into the vaccinia virus genome. To assess the exact position of a DNA band without damaging it with UV-light, load DNA marker on both sides of your digested fragment on the agarose gel. After electrophoresis, separate the lanes with the marker from the remaining part (contains the digested fragments) of the gel. Using UV-light, cut out a small piece in each of the marker lanes at the expected height of the digested product. Position these lanes back together with the part containing the digested fragment. Cut the agarose gel between the two indicated positions in order to remove the agarose slice with the digested fragment.Do not pipette vaccinia virus DNA with regular tips after proteinase K digestion. These tips can damage the DNA due to their narrow opening. Cut the end of the tips with scissors to enlarge the opening.In order to keep the DNA intact, do not vortex the tubes containing vaccinia virus DNA after proteinase K digestion. Vortexing can break the large vaccinia virus DNA.Do not dry the vaccinia virus pellet but resuspend it immediately in water.In our laboratory CHEF Mapper-II pulse-field gel electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad) is used. For the optimal separation of the bands a 1 % agarose gel should be prepared. The gel runs for approximately 18 h (switch time 3\u201330 s, angle 120\u00b0, voltage 6 V/cm). The set up can vary depending on the system used for PFGE.The vaccinia DNA itself is not infectious. The addition of fowl-pox virus as a helper virus allows the rescue of recombinant vaccinia virus. Furthermore, the infection of CV-1 cells with the fowl-pox virus leads to an abortive infection. After the rescue of the recombinant vaccinia viruses there is no infectious fowl-pox virus present in the reaction.The conditions for the electroporation depend on the cell line and device used for the electroporation.
