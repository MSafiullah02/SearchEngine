Antibodies to the SARS-N protein are highly detectable in SARS patients, and the antigenicity of SARS-N protein is better than that of the SARS-CoV spike (SARS-S) protein (Chan et al., 2005a, Chan et al., 2005b, Shi et al., 2003, Wu et al., 2004). Furthermore, the N proteins are capable of inducing protective immune responses against SARS-CoV infection (Kim et al., 2004). These features make it a suitable candidate for the development of diagnostic agents, and possibly subunit vaccines. Because the SARS-N gene contains no glycosylation sites (Marra et al., 2003), SARS-N proteins have been expressed mostly in E. coli (ErSARS-N proteins) for use as a diagnostic reagent. However, some cross-reactive responses of this recombinant protein with the antibodies against other coronaviruses have been detected by Western blot and ELISA (Sun and Meng, 2004, Woo et al., 2004, Yu et al., 2005). Since serum antibodies against the other coronaviruses are widespread within the human population (Hruskova et al., 1990, Schmidt et al., 1986), it is important to clear the antigenic properties of this recombinant protein.",

The phosphorylation of N protein has been implicated in a variety of functions, including translocalization of N protein from nucleus to cytoplasm and membrane, encapsidation of the viral RNA genome, viral transcription and replication, and regulation of numerous signal transduction pathways in host cells (Huang et al., 2004, Surjit et al., 2005). This phosphorylation of SARS-N protein may also affect the antigenicity of the protein. However, the phosphorylation of proteins expressed in prokaryotic systems has not been reported, while N protein expressed in mammalian cells is mainly phosphorylated at serine/threonine residues by multiple kinases (Surjit et al., 2005). Thus, ErSARS-N protein could be antigenically different from native SARS-N protein in virus-infected cells and phosphorylated rSARS-N protein expressed in a eukaryotic system.",

These specimens were used for quality control of different serological assays performed in different European laboratories acting as National Reference Centers for SARS diagnosis. Sera from 20 healthy donors and 160 non-SARS patients that were confirmed to be SARS negative by microneutralizing assay as the gold standard method for SARS serology were used for specificity analysis of the rSARS-N protein (Chan et al., 2005a, Chan et al., 2005b).

Therefore, we examined the antigenic specificity of BrSARS-N protein compared with ErSARS-N using an indirect ELISA on five SARS positive sera and 180 SARS negative sera. ErSARS-N protein included for comparison in the present study was expressed in the same cDNA construct at the ORF of BrSARS-N protein. This protein was previously observed to be cross-reactive with SARS negative serum (Sun and Meng, 2004, Woo et al., 2004, Yu et al., 2005). In reactions in which equal amounts of each rSARS-N protein were coated onto ELISA plates, higher specificity was observed in the BrSARS-N protein than in the ErSARS-N protein. Thirty-four of the 180 SARS negative sera showed OD450 values higher than 0.500, ranging from 0.500 to 1.000 in ErSARS-N-based ELISA. In contrast, when the BrSARS-N protein was used, only four of 180 SARS negative sera showed OD450 values below 0.400 (data not shown). To further analyze the specificity of rSARS-N protein, we chose five SARS negative sera that had showed high OD450 values (>0.500) on ErSARS-N-based ELISA. The specificity of rSARS-N protein was confirmed by indirect ELISA (Fig. 2A) and Western blotting using these negative sera and five SARS positive sera. For positive serum, ErSARS-N protein showed strong positive bands at approximately 46 kDa, while BrSARS-N protein showed two major antigenic bands of approximately 46 and 48 kDa (Fig. 2B, left panel). For negative serum, all of the five negative sera showed a strong false-positive reaction with ErSARS-N protein at the same size band of 46 kDa as result of SARS positive serum, while none of the five negative sera showed false-positive reactions at the two major antigenic bands of BrSARS-N protein (Fig. 2B, right panel). This result indicated that the high value in indirect ELISA using ErSARS-N protein was not to the result of the potential interaction between residual E. coli antigens and antibodies against E. coli in human serum. Thus, the ErSARS-N protein has a higher cross-reactivity with SARS negative serum than BrSARS-N protein.",

Therefore, the cut-off value for detection of SARS-N antibody was set to 0.200, which is equal to the mean + two times the standard deviation of the OD450 for serum diluents. According to the cut-off threshold (0.200), the lower limits of the antibody detectable with BrSARS-N and ErSARS-N protein in the indirect ELISA were at the same concentration at 1.6 and 3.1 nM/well, respectively. At maximum, the immunoreactivity of BrSARS-N under nondenaturing conditions was 2.5-fold higher than that of ErSARS-N (Fig. 3B).

However, the antigenicity of the SARS-N protein is not yet wholly understood. Recent reports have suggested that SARS negative serum contains with cross-reacting antibodies, such as antibodies against other coronaviruses, and these antibodies are cause false-positive reactions with recombinant SARS-N protein (Sun and Meng, 2004, Woo et al., 2004, Yu et al., 2005). Some investigators have reported that the cross-response of full-length recombinant N protein with antibodies to other coronaviruses is caused by highly conserved motifs in the N-terminus of this protein (Yu et al., 2005). In the present study, BrSARS-N was also contained within these N-termini, and all of the human serum samples used in this study contained high titers (approximately 1:320 HAI unit) of antibodies against human coronavirus OC43 and 229E (data not shown). The BrSARS-N protein showed little cross-reactivity with SARS negative sera in Western blot analysis as well as indirect ELISA. Indeed, BrSARS-N protein reacted more strongly to SARS-N mAbs than to ErSARS-N, which has been widely used for the development of SARS diagnostic methods. These results suggest that there are other factors affecting the antigenicity of SARS-N protein.",

However, the BrSARS-N and ErSARS-N proteins were showed different levels of antigenicity in the present study. The differential antigenicity of both rSARS-N proteins was demonstrated by Western blot under denaturing conditions, and did not result from the conformation of SARS-N protein. The phosphorylation of N protein is a well-documented phenomenon in many coronaviruses (Calvo et al., 2005, Chen et al., 2005, Surjit et al., 2005, Wilbur et al., 1986, Zakhartchouk et al., 2005). Given that this phosphorylation event is restricted to the eukaryotic system, the ErSARS-N protein would have properties different from those of the native N protein. In contrast with the prokaryotic expression system, the baculovirus-insect cell expression system can provide this type of post-translational modification similarly to that of mammalian cells. In the present study, the BrSARS-N protein was abundantly phosphorylated. This suggests that this N protein may have similar antigenicity to that of the native N protein. Therefore, we investigated whether the phosphorylation of SARS-N protein could affect the cross-reactivity with SARS negative serum and immunoreactivity with SARS-N antibodies.",

These previous reports suggest that the phosphorylation is closely related to the antigenicity of recombinant protein. In this study, we were able to observe that the phosphorylated BrSARS-N protein shows little cross-response with SARS negative serum under denaturing conditions, but BrSARS-N protein dephosphorylated by PP1 remarkably enhance a false-positive reaction against SARS negative serum. This probably occurs because the phosphorylation at conserved epitopes may inhibit non-specific binding of cross-reacting antibodies, which may result in higher specificity of the BrSARS-N protein than the ErSARS-N protein.

This result indicates that some conformational epitopes of SARS-N protein might cause the cross-response with SARS negative serum; this occurs independently upon the phosphorylation of SARS-N protein. Thus, the use of phosphorylation BrSARS-N protein in Western blot analysis under denaturing conditions would be more suitable for use in SARS serology than compared to other diagnostic methods. Furthermore, SARS negative and positive serum could be clearly distinguished by indirect ELISA using BrSARS-N protein under physiological conditions, similar to that observed for Western blot under denaturing conditions. SARS-N protein containing no cysteine residues and no disulphide bonds would be less stable than other structural proteins of SARS-CoV (Wang et al., 2004) and the surface of microtiter plate used in indirect ELISA is highly charged. Therefore, the conformational epitopes of SARS-N against cross-reacting antibodies may be destroyed by the surface of the plate, and/or cross-reacting epitopes may be hidden by the surface. As ELISA-based serology is less labor-intensive and easier to standardize than Western blot assay, Western blot confirmation of positive ELISA results is probably a better choice for routine use in clinical laboratories.",

Indeed, the immunoreactivity of BrSARS-N protein was remarkably reduced when this protein was dephosphorylated with PP1, which suggests a correlation between the phosphorylation and the antigenic reactivity of SARS-N protein.

The membranes were cut into strips and incubated with five SARS positive sera and five SARS negative sera, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG, and proteins were detected using DAB staining. All five SARS negative sera showed strong positive bands with ErSARS-N protein, but not with BrSARS-N, suggesting that BrSARS-N protein is more specific than ErSARS-N protein.",
