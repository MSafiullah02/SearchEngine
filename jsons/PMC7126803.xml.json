Respiratory viral infections have long been recognized as important contributors to death and disability in older adults. The specific reasons why these infectious agents, which usually cause self-limited disease in healthy young adults, are associated with enhanced disease with aging are not completely known. Analysis of this problem is complicated by the difficulties in separating the effects of age itself from those of the chronic diseases that often accompany aging. However, more limited physiologic reserves with aging and potentially blunted immune responses may play a role.",

            "text": "Influenza is unique among respiratory viruses in that epidemics are regularly associated with excess morbidity and mortality (Glezen, 1982), manifested as excess rates of pneumonia and influenza associated hospitalization during influenza epidemics (Glezen, 1982, Perrotta et al., 1985). For older individuals, the yearly estimate is 4.1\u20134.4 million excess respiratory illnesses associated with influenza each year (Sullivan et al., 1993). Recent, non-pandemic influenza seasons have been associated, on average, with 5600 excess pneumonia and influenza deaths and 21 300 all-cause excess deaths in the USA (Simonsen et al., 1997). Both influenza A and B can be associated with severe illness (Blaine et al., 1980), although the highest mortality rates are generally seen during years with significant H3 virus activity. Complications and deaths from influenza are of particular concern in those with certain \u2018high-risk\u2019 medical conditions, primarily the elderly and adults and children with cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions (Barker and Mullooly, 1980) The presence of such conditions significantly increases the risk of influenza-related hospitalizations above that associated with age alone (Barker and Mullooly, 1982; Table 1\n). Although only about one-fourth of hospitalizations for influenza occur in individuals over the age of 65, three-fourths of influenza-related deaths occur in this age group (Perrotta et al., 1985). It is important to recognize that the majority of elderly high-risk individuals who are hospitalized during influenza epidemics were ambulatory and leading productive lives prior to their acute illness (Barker and Mullooly, 1980).",

In one recent randomized placebo-controlled trial, inactivated vaccine was approximately 58% effective in preventing laboratory-documented influenza in an otherwise healthy elderly population (Fig. 1\n; Govaert et al., 1994). In addition, retrospective case\u2013control studies have documented the effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccines in the elderly. For example, the study by Barker and Mulooly documented a 72% reduction in hospitalization and 87% reduction in mortality with influenza vaccine in the elderly (Barker and Mullooly, 1980). A recent meta-analysis of cohort observational studies resulted in pooled estimates of efficacy of vaccine of 56% for prevention of influenza-related respiratory illness, 53% for prevention of pneumonia, 50% for prevention of hospitalization, and 68% for prevention of death (Gross et al., 1995). Vaccination was 43\u201365% effective in preventing pneumonia and influenza-related hospital deaths, and 27\u201330% effective in preventing deaths from all causes during influenza outbreak periods in non-institutionalized persons 45 and older in Manitoba (Fedson et al., 1993). It has been estimated that among elderly persons living in the community, influenza vaccination is associated with a direct savings of $117 per year per person vaccinated (Nichol et al., 1994).",

In some studies, the presence of chronic disability, rather than age of the subject, appears better able to predict lack of responsiveness (Gross et al., 1989).

While some studies have shown enhanced serum antibody responses, no single formulation has emerged as clearly superior. Inactivated influenza vaccine formulated with MF59 (FLUAD, Chiron vaccines) has resulted in slightly higher levels of post-immunization antibody in elderly recipients compared with non-adjuvanted vaccine, but at the expense of higher rates of mild local and systemic side-effects (Martin, 1997, Minutello et al., 1999). This vaccine formulation has been licensed in Italy. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been reported to increase post-vaccination antibody titers in elderly subjects, primarily in those without a history of previous vaccination (Ben-Yehuda et al., 1998). Liposomal inactivated vaccine was well-tolerated and induced more frequent CTL responses but did not enhance antibody responses to vaccine in a small study of elderly subjects (Powers, 1997). In contrast, a virosomal preparation incorporating liposomes with phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine did result in enhanced antibody responses in elderly subjects (Gluck et al., 1994), and has been licensed in Switzerland. Conjugation of the hemagluttinin to a protein carrier has been reported to enhance immune responses and protective efficacy (Gravenstein et al., 1994). The use of thymosin-alpha 1 has improved antibody responsiveness in elderly men (Gravenstein et al., 1989), as did the cytokine IL-2 (Provinciali et al., 1994). As additional potential adjuvants are described, it is likely that further improvements will be forthcoming.",

Systemic antibody responses to cold-adapted influenza A virus vaccines as measured by hemagglutinin-specific IgG enzyme immunoassays of various types have been observed in from 0 to 48% of subjects, significantly less than the rate of systemic antibody responses to inactivated vaccines in these studies. In addition, geometric mean serum antibody titers are higher following inactivated influenza vaccines than after cold-adapted vaccine. Local HA-specific IgA responses have been seen in up to 60% of elderly recipients of cold-adapted vaccines, while slightly lower rates of local antibody response have been seen following inactivated vaccine. Mean post-vaccination nasal antibody levels have often been difficult to interpret because of a high degree of variability in the level of pre-immunization antibody and the inherent difficulty in making these types of measurements, but appear to be somewhat higher in those receiving cold-recombinant vaccines. Relatively less work has been performed to evaluate cold-adapted influenza B virus vaccines in the elderly. However, one study in ambulatory elderly adults demonstrated that cold-adapted influenza B virus vaccines to be were well-tolerated, but less immunogenic than inactivated vaccine (Treanor et al., 1994).

This has led to the hypothesis that the use of both vaccine might have a synergistic effect, with inactivated vaccines providing systemic immunity and the cold-adapted vaccine augmenting the local immune response. Preliminary evaluation of the immunogenicity of parenteral inactivated vaccine given with intranasal cold-adapted vaccine has suggested that combined live and inactivated vaccines resulted in modest, but consistent, increases in the frequency of immune responses compared with either inactivated vaccine or cold-adapted vaccine alone (Powers et al., 1989, Powers et al., 1991, Gorse et al., 1996, Treanor and Betts, 1998).",

All participants received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine parenterally and were randomly assigned to receive either live attenuated influenza A (H3N2) vaccine or placebo intranasally. Influenza A activity was relatively quiescent during this study, and attack rates of influenza in the participating nursing homes were generally low. However, over the 3-year period of the study, participants who received intranasal vaccine and who were subsequently exposed to influenza A had significantly lower rates of laboratory-documented influenza A and outbreak associated (i.e. temporally related to institutional influenza outbreaks) respiratory illness (Fig. 2\n; Treanor et al., 1992). A similar study comparing intramuscular trivalent inactivated vaccine combined with intranasal cold-adapted influenza B/Yamagata/88 to inactivated vaccine alone also showed reductions in laboratory-documented influenza B with combined vaccination, but the rates of infection were too low to allow conclusions to be drawn about the efficacy of this approach for influenza B (Treanor and Betts, 1998).",

In addition, systemic antibody responses to cold-adapted vaccines are generally less frequent and of lower magnitude than seen with inactivated vaccine, while local antibody responses are only marginally greater. However, combined intranasal cold-adapted and intramuscular inactivated vaccine provided significantly greater protection in this population than inactivated vaccine alone, despite the very modest apparent increase in immunogenicity.

Efficacy has been demonstrated in infections due to H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 influenza A viruses. Neither drug has been subjected to extensive efficacy evaluation in high-risk subjects. One placebo-controlled blinded study carried out in nursing home patients showed more rapid reduction in fever and in symptoms in rimantadine recipients. Furthermore, physicians who were caring for these patients, but who were blinded to the study drug status, prescribed significantly fewer antipyretics, antitussives, and antibiotics, and obtained fewer chest X-rays for the rimantadine recipients (Betts et al., 1987).

Amantadine and rimantadine have similar levels of efficacy in this setting, but rimantadine is associated with significantly fewer side-effects (Dolin et al., 1982). Efficacy has also been demonstrated in post-exposure prophylaxis in the family setting (Galbraith et al., 1969). These findings suggest that prophylaxis of contacts in other closed settings, such as nursing homes, would also effectively terminate influenza outbreaks. Evidence of the effectiveness of outbreak-initiated prophylaxis in nursing homes is largely observational, but does suggest that early initiation can reduce the rate of influenza in institutions (Atkinson et al., 1986, Arden et al., 1988). Use of such prophylaxis for 14 days is as effective as are longer courses of administration (Drinka et al., 1998). It is currently recommended that when institutional outbreaks of influenza occur, chemoprophylaxis should be administered to all residents, and continued for approximately 2 weeks, or for 1 week after termination of the outbreak (CDC, 1998).",

At 100 mg per day, the incidence of CNS side-effects in the elderly is substantially lower with rimantadine than amantadine (Keyser et al., 1998). However, side-effects of rimantadine in the elderly occur at a higher rate than in young adults (Tominack and Hayden, 1987). Administration of amantadine to individuals with motor seizures has been reported to increase the frequency of seizures (Atkinson et al., 1986). This may also occur with rimantadine, but appears to be less frequent (Soo, 1989). In one study, long-term prophylactic administration of rimantadine in a nursing home population was well-tolerated and had an estimated efficacy of 58% in prevention of flu in a nursing home (Monto et al., 1995).",

The first of these compounds to be evaluated in clinical studies, 4-guanidino-2,4-dideoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid, or zanamivir (Relenza) is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the neuraminidase of influenza A and B viruses. Zanamivir has significant antiviral activity against a wide variety of laboratory and clinical influenza A and B isolates in cell culture, and in the mouse and ferret models (von Itzstein et al., 1993, Woods et al., 1993). The drug is not orally bioavailable and is administered topically. Intranasal zanamivir was effective in the therapy of influenza in experimentally infected adult volunteers in whom both early treatment (beginning 26\u201332 h after challenge) and late treatment (beginning 50 h after challenge) were effective in reducing virus shedding compared with placebo, and early treatment also reduced symptom scores and reduced the frequency of middle ear abnormalities (Hayden et al., 1996, Walker et al., 1997). Subsequently, inhaled zanamivir was shown to be effective in the early treatment of naturally acquired acute influenza A and B in man, resulting in an approximately 24-h decrease in the duration of symptoms when administered within the first 48 h of illness (Hayden et al., 1997). Zanamivir also reduced the frequency of complications in a small number of high-risk subjects (MIST, 1998). This drug thus represents the first antiviral with clear-cut clinical efficacy against both influenza A and B in man. Zanamivir was recently licensed for treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza in adults. An oral antineuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir (Tamiflu), is in development, and has also demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in experimentally infected adults (Hayden et al., 1999a).",

However, RSV has recently been identified as a common cause of serious disease in a number of adult populations, including immunocompromised persons, frail elderly, and those with underlying cardiopulmonary disease (Englund et al., 1988, Englund et al., 1991, Martin et al., 1988, Hertz et al., 1989, Falsey et al., 1992a, Falsey et al., 1995a, Harrington et al., 1992, Whimbey et al., 1995) Despite recent advances in the understanding of RSV infections in infants, three important areas regarding RSV infection in the adult remain relatively unexplored.

RSV infections have been documented in attendees of senior daycare centers, the community-dwelling and institutionalized elderly (Falsey et al., 1992a, Falsey et al., 1995a, Falsey et al., 1995b). RSV outbreaks are well-documented in nursing homes, with attack rates ranging from 2 to 89% (Mathur et al., 1980, Sorvillo et al., 1984, Agius et al., 1990, Falsey et al., 1990). However, it should also be noted that RSV is consistently identified each winter as a cause of sporadic respiratory illness in nursing homes indicating that RSV infections are not limited to nosocomial outbreaks (Nicholson et al., 1990, Osterweil et al., 1990, Falsey et al., 1992a). Even during documented influenza virus epidemics, RSV infections can be identified in this population (Falsey et al., 1990). In one surveillance study in a 550-bed nursing home in Rochester, New York, RSV caused 27% of 149 acute respiratory tract infections during a single winter season (Falsey et al., 1992a). In this study, rhinovirus (9%) and parainfluenza viruses (6%) were the next most commonly identified agents. Of the 40 RSV infected patients, four (10%) developed pneumonia and two (5%) died.",

Although there were no deaths directly attributable to RSV, one infected patient required hospitalization for pneumonia. There is little information available on the incidence of RSV infection in the community dwelling elderly, although significant illness clearly occurs each winter. Three cases of culture positive RSV lower respiratory tract infection were identified in one analysis of community acquired pneumonia (Zaroukian et al., 1988), and 57 cases were reported among elderly patients (average age 75) in a retrospective 10-year review of hospitalization for pneumonia in Sweden, representing 2.3% of all pneumonia cases (Vikerfors et al., 1987, Vikerfors et al., 1988). In Rochester, NY, 10% of 1600 admissions of persons 65 years of age or older for acute cardiopulmonary or flu-like illness over a 3-year period were caused by RSV, and 13% were due to influenza virus (Falsey et al., 1995a). Underlying COPD or congestive heart failure was present in 43 and 63% of the RSV infected patients, respectively. Mortality among RSV infected patients was 10%, comparable with the 6% mortality in influenza virus infected patients, and 14% were discharged to a higher level of care. Among 1195 hospitalized adults in Ohio, RSV was the third most common identifiable cause (4.4%), behind Streptococcus pneumoniae (6.2%) and influenza virus (5.4%) (Dowell et al., 1996). Of the 57 RSV cases, 55% were over 65 years of age. Slightly more than half had underlying COPD, coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure.",

In the United Kingdom during 1991\u20131994, excess mortality in older persons was temporally associated with peak RSV activity in children (Fleming et al., 1993).

It is not known if the increase in severe RSV infections in this age group is a result of underlying frailty of the host, global immunosenescence, or an age related decline in one or another of RSV-specific immune functions. Very little is known about the role of antibody to RSV in the elderly, with the exception that all adults have detectable serum antibody (Falsey et al., 1992). Elderly adults are capable of mounting a brisk serum IgA and IgG response to RSV infection (Angius et al., 1990). This is important, because relative lack of serum neutralizing antibody was recently found to be a risk factor for RSV disease in a study of frail elderly adults (Falsey et al., 1998). Baseline blood samples were obtained from subjects attending a senior daycare center and volunteers were followed over the next 26 months and evaluated for any acute respiratory tract illness. Samples from 22 subjects who developed symptomatic RSV infection were compared with 22 control subjects who did not become infected with RSV. The mean serum IgG titer to RSV fusion protein (F) was significantly lower in the RSV-infected group compared with the controls as were the neutralizing titers to group A RSV (Fig. 3\n). These data suggest that older adults with low levels of serum neutralizing antibody may be at greater risk of developing symptomatic RSV and supports the view that boosting titers by vaccination may be beneficial.",

One approach of potential benefit for the elderly is the use of purified RSV F protein (PFP-2, Wyeth\u2013Lederle vaccines). Results in previously infected children who were vaccinated with PFP-2 demonstrated stimulation of neutralizing antibody to both group A and B strains, although large-scale efficacy studies have not been performed (Belshe et al., 1993). PFP-2 was also safe and reasonably immunogenic in both healthy and frail elderly subjects. Twenty-nine of 33 (87%) healthy elderly recipients of PFP-2 vaccine had a 4-fold or greater rise in serum IgG to the F protein at 8 weeks post-vaccination and twenty of 33 (61%) had a 4-fold or greater rise in serum neutralizing titer to group A or group B RSV. In that study, response to vaccination was inversely correlated with pre-immunization serum neutralizing titers. Subjects were followed throughout the ensuing winter, and 3 RSV infections were identified in the placebo group and none in the vaccine group (Falsey and Walsh, 1996). In a second study, PFP-2 was evaluated in 37 institutionalized persons over age 65 (Falsey and Walsh, 1997). Vaccination was well-tolerated and 36 of 37 subjects completed the study. Nineteen of 36 (53%) of vaccinees had a 4-fold or greater rise in IgG to F protein at 4 weeks and 17 (47%) had a significant rise in neutralizing titers to either group A or B virus. The response rate to PFP-2 again correlated with pre-immunization neutralization titers, although PFP-2 appeared to be slightly less immunogenic in the institutionalized elderly than in the healthy elderly",

            "text": "Live attenuated vaccines represent an attractive approach towards the development of an RSV vaccine because they should restimulate local nasal immunity and a balanced cellular immune response. Initial results with temperature-sensitive (ts) or cold-adapted (ca) mutants were disappointing in infants, as vaccines were either poorly immunogenic, excessively virulent, or genetically unstable (Kim et al., 1973, Wright et al., 1982). Currently, several new live virus vaccines are being evaluated in infants. Genetically stable, attenuated viruses have been produced from previous cold passaged and temperature-sensitive (cpts) mutants by additional chemical mutagenesis and the precise genetic alterations defined by sequence analysis of viral RNA (Crowe et al., 1994, Firestone et al., 1996). The cpts-248/404 virus is one of several candidate temperature-sensitive vaccines and has a shut-off temperature of 38\u00b0C (Firestone et al., 1996). Studies in rodents and chimpanzees show the virus to be phenotypically stable, and despite restricted replication are immunogenic and protective against wild-type challenge (Crowe et al., 1995, Crowe et al., 1996). Ts-1C is another live virus vaccine candidate produced by chemical mutagenesis with 5-fluorouracil (McKay et al., 1988, Pringle et al., 1993). Virus replication is shut off at 37\u00b0C and, in studies of adult volunteers, the vaccine was found to be stable, attenuated, and modestly immunogenic. The recent development of full length infectious cDNA clones of RSV, which produce live virus upon transfection of cells in tissue culture, offers the potential of a limitless supply of specifically altered live vaccine products (Collins et al., 1995).",

Although each of the serotypes has distinctive epidemiology and clinical characteristics, in individual cases it is generally not possible to distinguish between the viruses. Although the epidemiology of PIV infection is relatively constant on a national level, there is substantial regional variation in the distribution of serogroups each year (Chanock and McIntosh, 1990). Each of the viruses can cause a wide spectrum of disease from mild upper respiratory symptoms to life threatening pneumonia. PIV1 tends to occur in the fall every other year and is associated with half of all croup cases, but also causes bronchiolitis and pneumonia. PIV2, like PIV1 may occur every other year, although also is seen annually, and is associated with croup. Infection with PIV1 and PIV2 can occur at any age, although severe disease is uncommon under age 1 year. Most children demonstrate serologic evidence of infection with PIV1 and PIV2 by the age of 5 years. In contrast, PIV3 tends to infect infants less than 6 months of age and half of all infants are infected in the first year of life, with most of the rest infected by age 2 years. PIV3 is not specifically associated with croup, and is second to RSV as a cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young infants. The virus is endemic and infection occurs throughout the year including winter, spring and summer months.",

            "text": "Although generally considered a disease of childhood, the parainfluenza viruses, like RSV, have recently been recognized as causes of serious respiratory illness in certain adult populations such as the elderly and the severely immunocompromised. Parainfluenza infection in an adult always represents re-infection, and generally symptoms are limited to the upper respiratory tract, or produce mild lower tract symptoms (Cooney et al., 1975). Within families, up to 25% of young adult parents develop evidence of infection when parainfluenza virus is introduced into the household (Cooney et al., 1975). PIV infections have been documented in community dwelling elderly with pneumonia or signs of lower respiratory tract infection (Mufson et al., 1967, Fransen et al., 1969, Cooney et al., 1975, Stanek and Heinz, 1988, Greenberg, 1991, Monto and Sullivan, 1993). However, the incidence and clinical significance of PIV in these groups appears to be variable. In one report of community acquired PIV lower respiratory tract infection, PIV3 was isolated from two of 361 patients and documented seroconversion to PIV in 23 of 346 subjects (6.6%) (Mufson et al., 1967). In persons between 60\u201370, 70\u201380, and >80 years of age, seroconversion to PIV was associated with 11, 14 and 21% of the lower respiratory tract illnesses, respectively, in contrast to rates of 3, 4 and 6% in controls without respiratory symptoms. In another serologic study of respiratory illness from Sweden, 69 cases of PIV infection were detected out of 598 patients with pneumonia (Fransen et al., 1969). Of the 189 patients greater than 60 years of age, 20 (11%) had serologic evidence of PIV infection. More recently, PIV infection was identified in 2.1% of acute respiratory illness in persons over age 40 years during 11 years of community surveillance in Tecumseh, MI (Monto and Sullivan, 1993). For comparison, influenza A and B viruses were identified as the cause of illness in 10.3%. However, not all investigators have described parainfluenza virus as a cause of lower respiratory tract illness in adults (Cooney et al., 1975, MacFarlane et al., 1993, Marrie et al., 1996).",

Although immunogenic, it was not efficacious in infants and was thus abandoned. However, in contrast to the findings with inactivated RSV vaccine discussed above, there was no evidence of enhanced disease in infants who received the PIV vaccine. Purified HN and F or virus vectors expressing HN or F have provided materials for either parenteral or topical immunization, and have been tested in animal models of parainfluenza virus infection (Blaine et al., 1980, Ray et al., 1985, Spriggs et al., 1987, Ray et al., 1988, Sullivan et al., 1993). Two live attenuated parainfluenza type 3 vaccines have also been developed for use in infants and children (Karron et al., 1995a, Karron et al., 1995b). One is a bovine PIV which has significant antigenic relatedness to human PIV3, and which is attenuated for primates based on its long evolution in a heterologous bovine host. The second is a cold-passaged (cp), cold-adapted (ca), temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant of the JS strain of human PIV3. In seronegative children this vaccine is well-tolerated and highly immunogenic (81% seroconversion) at the highest dose given (105 TCID50). However, in seropositive children who are perhaps more predictive of the performance of such a vaccine in adults, only 4 of 34 (11%) developed 4-fold rises in hemagglutination titers, and only 22% developed nasal IgA responses.",

The virus has been recovered from aspirates obtained by direct puncture of the maxillary sinuses of patients with acute sinusitis (Pitkaranta et al., 1997), and mucosal thickening and/or sinus exudates have been observed in as many as 77% of subjects with acute colds (Turner et al., 1992, Gwaltney et al., 1994). Clinically manifest acute sinusitis is seen in a small (0.5\u20135%) proportion of individuals with naturally occurring colds (Wald et al., 1991). As many as 40% of exacerbations of chronic bronchitis have been associated with RV infection (Eadie et al., 1966, Stenhouse, 1967, McNamara et al., 1969, Lambert et al., 1972). However, the effect of RV infection on pulmonary function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is less marked than that of influenza infection (Smith et al., 1985). It is not known whether rhinovirus invades the bronchial tree directly, but several studies indicate that direct invasion may occur (Halperin et al., 1983, Gern et al., 1999). Rhinovirus is also among the respiratory viruses shown to precipitate attacks of asthma, predominantly in children (Minor et al., 1974, Minor et al., 1976, Horn et al., 1979 but also in adults Teichtahl et al., 1997). Experimental RV infection of varying severity led to the development of wheezing and increased bronchial reactivity, as demonstrated by histamine provocation, in 20% of adults with mild to moderate asthma (Halperin et al., 1985).",

Distinctive club-shaped projections are present on the virus surface, giving the virus particle the appearance of having a crown or corona, from which it derives its name. Two antigenic types of human coronavirus have been recognized: the 229E-related strains that have been isolated in cell cultures such as human embryonic lung cell fibroblasts, and the OC43-related strains that require organ culture. The coronavirus group also appears to be an important cause of common colds, although the overall contribution to annual respiratory disease morbidity is uncertain. In longitudinal studies in adults, coronaviruses have accounted for 4\u201315% of acute respiratory disease annually and up to 35% during peak periods (Hamre and Beem, 1972, Hendley et al., 1972). Annual illness rates in children have been measured at 8%, with peak rates of up to 20% (Kaye et al., 1971, Kaye and Dowdle, 1975). The reported frequency of infection in adults for 229E and OC43 viruses has ranged from 15 to 25 per 100 persons per year, with up to 80% of infections occurring in persons with prior antibody to the infecting virus (Cavallaro and Monto, 1970, Hamre and Beem, 1972, Hendley et al., 1972, Monto and Lim, 1974). Most large peaks of coronavirus activity have occurred in winter and early spring, but infections have been detected throughout the year Macnaughton, 1982, Monto, 1997).",

Clinical illness caused by coronavirus and rhinovirus in ambulatory elderly adults was similar to that associated with influenza (Nicholson et al., 1997), and was associated with significant mobidity. Restriction of activity was seen in almost one-fifth of those with rhinovirus illnesses, and 43% of infections resulted in medical consultation. The presence of chronic medical conditions and smoking may be risk factors for the development of lower respiratory tract symptoms from rhinovirus infection (Nicholson et al., 1996).

A detailed review of all of the efforts over many years to generate such a treatment is beyond the scope of this review, but many such studies have utilized experimental infection of human adult volunteers for this purpose. Benefit has been seen in this model with early treatment with a combination of interferon \u03b12 and ipratroprium bromide given nasally and naproxen given orally (Gwaltney, 1992), and capsid binding agents such as pirodavir (Hayden et al., 1992) and pleconaril. Because 90% of rhinovirus serotypes use the same cellular receptor, receptor blockade with soluble ICAM-1 has also been evaluated with minor benefit (Turner et al., 1999). Pleconaril has been reported to reduce the duration of symptoms by 21% in naturally occuring colds (Hayden et al., 1999). Although serotype-specific immunity does develop after infection (Fleet et al., 1965), prospects for a rhinovirus vaccine are poor because of the multiplicity of rhinovirus serotypes.",

Influenza continues to result in a large burden of excess morbidity and mortality. Two effective measures, inactivated influenza vaccine, and the antiviral drugs rimantadine and amantadine, are currently available for control of this disease. Inactivated vaccine should be given yearly to all of those over the age of 65, as well as younger individuals with high-risk medical conditions and individuals delivering care to such persons. Live, intranasally administered attenuated influenza vaccines are also in development, and may be useful in combination with inactivated vaccine in the elderly. The antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine are effective in the treatment and prevention of influenza A, although rimantadine is associated with fewer side-effects. Recently, the inhaled neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir, which is active against both influenza A and B viruses, was licensed for use in uncomplicated influenza. The role of this drug in treatment and prevention of influenza in the elderly remains to be determined. Additional neuraminidase inhibitors are also being developed. In addition, to influenza, respiratory infections with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus have been identified as potential problems in the elderly. With increasing attention, it is probable that the impact of these infections in this age group will be more extensively documented. Understanding of the immunology and pathogenesis of these infections in elderly adults is in its infancy, and considerable additional work will need to be performed towards development of effective control measures.",
