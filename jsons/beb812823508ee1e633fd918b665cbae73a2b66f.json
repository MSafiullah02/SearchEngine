A deeper analysis of the genomes of individuals from different populations might explain their risk for infection. In this study, a combined analysis of ACE2 coding variants in different populations and computational chemistry calculations are conducted in order to probe the potential effects of ACE2 coding variants on SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 binding affinity. Our study reveals novel interaction data on the variants and SARS-CoV-2. We could show that ACE2-K26R; which is more frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population decrease the electrostatic attraction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2. On the contrary, ACE2-I468V, R219C, K341R, D206G, G211R were found to increase the electrostatic attraction and increase the binding to SARS-CoV-2; ordered by the strength of binding from weakest to strongest. I468V, R219C, K341R, D206G and G211R were more frequent in East Asian, South Asian, African and African American, European and European and South Asian populations, respectively. SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 interface in the WT protein and corresponding variants is showed to be a dominated by van der Waals (vdW) interactions. All the mutations except K341R induce an increase in the vdW attractions between the ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2. The largest increase of is observed for the R219C mutant.",

The risk of certain populations for the infection is also still not well understood and remains under investigation. After the identification of the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor 5 , a large number of reports have emerged trying to identify the pathology of the disease, and thus provide guidance to the efforts to design small molecules inhibitors 3, 5 . Some recent studies attempted to probe the comorbidity among infected patients, specifically patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart diseases, and cerebrovascular disease that showed increased risk. Whether ACE2 polymorphisms linked to the aforementioned diseases or administration of ACE2 modulating drugs have larger impact on the severity of infection is still a question to be investigated 6 .",

The existence of residues that are involved in energetically favorable interactions at the protein-protein interface leads to enhanced interactions leading to viral-host cells fusion, marking the onset of the infection 5, 9 . Therefore, we opted herein to investigate the nature of the interactions at the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 interface, and how the subtle variations in the structure of ACE2, induced by certain mutations, can alter the binding of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations. This was attempted here by analyzing different ACE2 missense variants that code for ACE2-K26R, ACE2-I468V, ACE2-R219C, ACE2-K341R, ACE2-D206G, ACE2-G211R and the strength of their interaction with the spike protein (S-protein) of SARS-COV-2 using Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo Sampling, which are dominated by electrostatics. The electrostatics interactions are the dominant factor in protein-protein interactions 10 , where classical treatment of these interactions in solution are described by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE).",

The structure of the Neutral amino acid transporter B 0 AT1 was removed from the PDB file, as it is far from the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 binding site. Furthermore, the structure of ACE2 was trimmed by removing residues from P733 to the end of the chain. The WT residues of ACE2 at positions 26, 206, 211, 219, 341 and 468 were mutated to Arg (R), Gly (G), Arg (R), Cys (C), Arg (R) and Val (V), respectively. The sidechains in the WT structure was replaced with the sidechains of the mutants using MCCE (Multi Conformer Continuum Electrostatics) (Fig. 1) . A set of different conformers of the sidechains were generated for WT and mutated structures by rotating the single bonds in the sidechains by 60 0 degrees. In addition, conformers were created for charged amino acids according to their possible protonation states. Then, these conformers were subjected to Monte Carlo sampling to obtain the Boltzmann distribution based on the electrostatic interactions, which are calculated using DELPHI. The most occupied conformers in the generated Boltzmann distributions were selected and subjected to molecular dynamics optimization using openMM. Finally, the interaction energies were computed for the optimized structures using MCCE. The electrostatics and van der Waals interactions between aminoacids in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 were analyzed using python-based code.",

Oppositely, substitution of R at position 26 was shown to reduce the electrostatic attraction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 to 2.59 Kcal/mol lower than that in WT. In addition, the D206G mutant showed similar electrostatic interactions to the WT. However, the R219C, I468V mutants showed significant decrease in the electrostatic attraction to by ~5 Kcal/mol compared to the WT (Table 1) . SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 interface in the WT protein and corresponding mutants is showed to be a dominated by vdW interactions, which accounts for more than 60% of the interaction energy. All the mutations except K341R induced an increase in the vdW attractions between the ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2. The largest increase of ~ 8 Kcal/mol is observed for the R219C mutant (Table 1) .",

In addition, the frequency of I468V which enhance ACE2 interaction with SARS-CoV-2 was observed in more than 1% of the East Asian population. Interestingly, I468V was not detected in the African, African American, American, Ashkenazi Jewish and Latino populations and was very rare in the European population. R219C was most frequent in the south Asian population (0.1%), but was not detected in other Asian subpopulations and was much less frequent or lacking in other populations. The K341R, which enhance the virus-receptor binding was most frequent in the African and African American populations; the average of the AF reported for the populations was ~ 0.4% and ~ 0.5%, respectively. Finally, the D206G and G211R, which showed the strongest interaction with ACE2 were most abundant in the European population, mounting to 0.06% and ~ 0.2%, respectively.

To better understand the susceptibility of individuals from different populations to SARS-CoV-2 and their risk of infection, large scale sequencing projects should be performed. Integrating population genetics will provide a new insight into the mystery of susceptibility, infection, pathogenicity and mortality in different regions. Sequencing of ACE2 in patients with the most severe conditions in every population will also provide a more reliable conclusion. The sequencing projects will not only help us test the association between ACE2 variants and risk/severity of infection in certain populations, it will also allow more accurate analysis of variants for other host genes involved in the viral entry and pathogenicity 21 . Finally, our findings can potentially guide future attempts to devise small molecules inhibitors, designed specifically to disrupt the interaction between the strongest ACE2 binding variants and the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 2 .",
