Because it has no polymerase proofreading mechanism, IBV is highly susceptible to mutation, and new serotypes and genotypes emerge constantly in the field (Capua et al., 1999; Zhao et al., 2016). Therefore, the virus exists as a wide range of antigenically and genetically distinct viral types, and the immune cross-protection offered by the different IBV serotypes is poor, making the prevention and control of this important pathogen both complex and challenging. Currently, over 50 different antigenic and genetic types of IBV are recognized, some of which have a substantial economic impact on the livestock industry and some of which are restricted to specific geographic areas (Capua et al., 1999; Wit et al., 2010). According to a new classification system based on the S1 gene phylogeny of IBV, six genotypes comprising 32 distinct viral lineages and a number of interlineage recombinants have been identified (Valastro et al., 2016).",

At present, the IBV strains isolated throughout the world differ greatly in their pathogenicity, virulence, and tissue tropism (de Wit et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2018), so it is necessary to monitor and explore the pathogenicity and immunological traits of IBV isolates to understand the current circulating trends in IBV.",

For unknown reasons, it has seldom been reported since 2013. In the present study, we found that although strain LGD belongs to the GI-22 genotype, it was clearly separated from the other GI-22 reference strains on a phylogenetic tree, and that it shares <93.64% nucleotide identity with other GI-22 genotype reference strains, according to a BLAST comparison. However, it is noteworthy that LGD shares 99.82% identity with strain gammaCoV/ck/China/I1225/17-1 (MH397199), which was newly isolated and reported in 2018 (Xu et al., 2018). Moreover, an 65ATTTA69-C71 insertion was detected at positions 65\u201371 in the S1 gene of the LGD isolate and in gammaCoV/ck/China/I1225/17-1, relative to the S1 genes of the other GI-22 reference strains. This insertion could alter the immunogenicity and pathogenicity of strain LGD. The recent isolation of GI-22 strains with unique mutations indicates the possible circulation of these viruses in China, and the antigenic changes caused by this insertion in the viruses of the GI-22 lineage warrant further attention and investigation.",

Some IBV strains may involve nephrosis and nephritis and are referred to as \u2018nephropathogenic strains\u2019, and these may not produce significant respiratory lesions or clinical signs. In this study, we found that the newly isolated strain LGD mainly caused depression, huddling, ruffled feathers, increased water intake, and slight watery diarrhea during the observation period. The mortality rate was 60% in 1-day-old chickens. Gross lesions were detected in the respiratory, urinary, and digestive systems of chickens inoculated with LGD. As the target organs of IBV, the trachea and kidney were heavily damaged, as we expected, and this damage included punctate hemorrhage and catarrhal exudates in the throat and trachea. The kidneys were swollen with urate deposits in the tubules and ureters. HE-stained pathological sections of these tissues showed results consistent with the necropsy results. The viral loads in the trachea and kidney were higher than in the other organs. It is worth noting that the bursa of Fabricius displayed heavy exudates of mucus and hemorrhage at 3, 5, and 7 dpc and that the HE-stained sections showed reduced numbers of lymphocytes in the follicles of the bursa at 5 dpc. The viral loads in the bursa were determined with real-time PCR. There have been few reports of the damage caused to the bursa of Fabricius by IBV, although one paper reported that the bursa of Fabricius is not sensitive to IBV infection (with strains H120, M41, and SAIBK) (Fan et al., 2012). However, we have observed damage to the bursa of Fabricius caused by IBV infection in previous studies (Zhao et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2016), which is consistent with the results presented in this paper. Because it is an important immune organ of chickens, damage to the bursa of Fabricius can lead to strong immunosuppression in chickens (Gimeno and Schat, 2018), so the immune function of IBV-infected chickens should be investigated in future studies.",

            "text": "The GI-22 genotype of IBV used in this study was isolated from chickens vaccinated twice with the H120 vaccine. The virus is probably able to evade the H120-induced immune response. The high genetic diversity among the endemic strains and the commercial vaccine strains of IBV results in increasing outbreaks of IB and a more complex control situation. Although Massachusetts IBV vaccines, such as H120, H52, and Ma5, have been widely used in the poultry industry, the immunized chickens are often not fully protected against wild IBV strains (Jiang et al., 2017). In a previous study, we showed that GI-19/QX-like IBV is the predominant strain in China (Zhao et al., 2016), so the preparation of a new candidate vaccine derived from GI-19/QX-like IBV may prove the best choice for IB control. We have developed a GI-19 genotype candidate vaccine, SZ200, which has displayed appropriate safety and immunogenicity in vivo experiments (Yan et al., 2018). Previous research has shown that although differences in S1 probably contribute to the failure to cross-protect some chicks, there may exist certain common epitopes between IBV isolates which have great importance in cross-immunity (Cavanagh et al., 1997). Information regarding the efficacy of vaccines against the IBV strains circulating in China will be valuable for the poultry industry when considering vaccine types. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of the GI-19 genotype strain SZ200 to determine whether it provides protection against the virulent GI-22 strain LGD.",

The SZ200-vaccinated group showed no clinical signs during the observation period after LGD challenge. Consistent with the clinical observations, no obvious gross lesions were detected in the different organs of the SZ200-vaccinated group. The quantification of ciliostasis (Cook et al., 1976; Cavanagh et al., 1997) or the determination of the viral loads in target organs are commonly used to assess chickens\u2019 immunity to challenge with IBV. The ciliostasis scores were clearly lower in the SZ200-vaccinated group than in the unvaccinated group after challenge with strain LGD, indicating that strain SZ200 effectively protected the respiratory tract. Significantly lower viral loads were also observed in the tissues of the vaccinated group after challenge, indicating that the SZ200 vaccine restricted LGD replication in different organs. These results indicate that GI-19 genotype vaccines can provide sufficient protection against the new GI-22 genotype strains identified so far, and may therefore offer promising candidate vaccines with which to control both wild GI-19 and GI-22 strains in the future.",
