A total of 79,251 confirmed cases were reported in China by February 28, and 39,002 cases out of them have been cured and discharged from hospitals. 5 During January 28 to March 13, 6 COVID-19 recurrence cases were found in Shangqiu, Henan Province, China ( Fig. 1 ). Among the recurrence cases, one case (Case 1) had significant post-discharge clinical symptoms and discomfort for nine days, one case (Case 3) had a mild cough, and 4 cases (Case 2, 4, 5, and 6) were asymptomatic with positive RT-PCR nucleic acid test.",
