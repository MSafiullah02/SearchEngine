Several proteins have been identified to play a role in this process, mostly members of the Toll-like receptor and retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor families. These receptors have been demonstrated to function in part by recognizing a diverse yet unique repertoire of nucleic acid substrates. Upon recognition of their ligands, these sensors activate distinct signaling pathways that lead to the secretion of type I interferon and inflammatory cytokines. It remains to be seen, however, if these sensors are redundant or whether each serves a unique function. In this work, we review the current knowledge of viral sensors, speculate on how they may function in vivo, and explore the potential reasons for their diversity.",

To protect themselves from pathogenic effects of these invaders, organisms have been required to develop mechanisms to detect and prevent viral infection. In higher mammals, this requirement has evolved the adaptive immune system, which is able to generate highly specific antibodies and T cells that recognize specific viral proteins and peptides that either block infection or target infected cells for destruction. Initiation of the adaptive immune response, however, is a slow process that requires days to weeks for maximum effect. To provide protection during the initial hours and days of infection, we have maintained a system of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) first seen in lower organisms that recognize broad motifs common to viral pathogens and thus serve as the initial sensors of viral infection. These sensors serve to initiate and maintain an antiviral response while the more specific adaptive response develops.",

Viruses can have genomes composed of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), or DNA and can replicate at different locations in the cell through different mechanisms that proceed through unique intermediates. Designing a system that can broadly detect all of these possibilities is challenging to say the least. To accomplish this, organisms use a variety of sensors from two main classes: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acidinducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs). These sensors protect different cellular compartments and signal through different adaptors to activate an antiviral response.",

There are currently three known members of this family: RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology-2 (LGP2) (1). Both RIG-I and MDA5 contain a DExD \u2044 H box helicase domain that binds dsRNA and two N-terminal caspase recruitment (CARD) domains involved in signaling (2) (3) (4) (5) . LGP2 contains the helicase domain but lacks the CARD domains and is thought to be a negative regulator (6, 7) . Both RIG-I and LGP2 also contain a C-terminal repressor domain that blocks signaling in the absence of ligand binding (5) . RIG-I binds preferentially to ssRNAs that are phosphorylated at the 5\u00a2-end (8, 9) and contain homopolyuridine or homopolyriboadenine motifs as well as short dsRNA (10) (11) (12) . MDA5 recognizes long dsRNAs and does not require 5\u00a2-phosphorylation (11) (12) (13) (14) . The differences in ligand preferences of the two proteins result in specificity for the recognition of individual viruses, which is discussed later.",

Cytoplasmic and endosomal sensors of viral nucleic acids. This figure illustrates the detection of viral products by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) family members. TLR3, TLR7 \u2044 8, and TLR9 are located on endosomal compartments in which they sense their double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), and CpG DNA ligands, respectively. TLR3 signals through the adapter protein Toll \u2044 interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-b (TRIF), which activates tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) (not shown) and the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) complex leading to interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) activation and IFN signaling. TRIF also signals through TRAF6, which leads to nuclear factor jB (NF-jB) activation and inflammatory cytokine production. TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 signal through the MyD88 adapter. MyD88 signals through a protein complex consisting of TRAF6 and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 \u2044 4 (IRAK1 \u2044 4) (not shown), leading to the activation of type I IFN and NF-jB signaling.

IPS-1 signals through TRAF3 and the TBK-1 \u2044 inhibitor of NF-jB kinase e complex to activate IRF-3 and IRF-7 and then type I IFN. IPS-1 also signals through FAS-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) leading to the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-10 (not shown), which causes NF-jB activation and inflammatory cytokine production. LGP2 does not signal through IPS-1 and is considered to be a negative regulator of RIG-I. inducing IFN-b (Cardif)], which is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane (15) (16) (17) (18) .

Activated IRF-3 and IRF-7 translocate into the nucleus and bind IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), inducing the expression of type I IFNs (22) . IPS-1 also interacts with FASassociated death domain (FADD)-containing protein (23) . FADD activates caspase-8 and caspase-10, and the activation of the caspase death effector domains activates NF-jB, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines (24) .

Accordingly, RNA interference of mRNA for DAI in cells inhibits DNA-mediated antiviral responses. Furthermore, Nacht domain-, LRR-, and PYD-containing protein 3 (NALP3), a component of the cytosolic molecular complex termed the inflammasome, has been shown to recognize adenoviral DNA, inducing activation of caspase-1 and maturation of pro-IL-1b in macrophages (47) . Correspondingly, mice lacking NALP3 or its signaling adapter, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase (ASC), display reduced innate inflammatory responses to adenovirus particles.

It is proposed that 2\u00a2,5\u00a2-linked oligoadenylate generated by viral infection activates RNase L to cleave self-RNA into small RNA products, which are responsible for RLR signaling. However, it is not yet known how these small self-RNAs are recognized by MDA5 and RIG-I. PKR has been shown to dimerize upon binding of dsRNA. The activated PKR dimer phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2-a (eIF2-a), which results in the inhibition of translation, preventing viral replication (49) .

Activation of this receptor leads to Janus kinase (JAK) \u2044 signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signal transduction pathways (50, 51) . These genes increase the cellular resistance to viral infection and sensitize virally infected cells to apoptosis (52) . Interestingly, several viral sensors are among those genes induced by IFN. They in turn enable the production of IFN, creating a positive feedback loop that creates a local cellular response. In addition, type I IFNs directly activate dendritic cells (DC) and natural killer (NK) cells and promote the survival and effector functions of T and B cells, providing a link between the innate response to infection and the adaptive immune response (53) (54) (55) (56) .",

The current paradigm is that RIG-I recognizes RNA-containing 5\u00a2-triphosphates, while MDA5 recognizes dsRNA. Therefore it is not surprising that RIG-I has been shown to detect influenza A and B viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and some flaviviruses (Japanese encephalitis virus and hepatitis C virus) (13, 60, 61) . Likewise, MDA5 detects picornaviruses such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Mengo virus, and Theilers virus (13, 14) as well as caliciviruses (62) . These viruses contain a 5\u00a2-VPg cap instead of 5\u00a2-triphosphate and make large amounts of dsRNA during replication. However, other results do not neatly fit this paradigm. RIG-I and MDA5 play redundant roles in the recognition of West Nile virus (63) , Dengue virus, (61) paramyxovirus, and reovirus (61), most of which contain 5\u00a2-triphosphates. In addition, although Sendai virus has been shown to activate RIG-I, it encodes for a protein, the V protein, that is a specific inhibitor of MDA5 (64) . Furthermore, murine hepatitis virus, a member of the coronavirus family that does not contain VPg, has recently been shown to be recognized by MDA5 (65) . One explanation is that, although RIG-I preferentially recognizes 5\u00a2-triphosphates and polyuridine-rich regions, it can also recognize short dsRNA, while MDA5 recognizes long dsRNA (11) . The ability of MDA5 and RIG-I to specifically detect certain viruses while also detecting common pathogens illustrates the need for multiple sensors to recognize and control the wide variety of viral pathogens.",

Accordingly, TLR3 has been implicated in the detection of several RNA viruses such as EMCV (67), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (68, 69), West Nile virus (70) , and Punta Toro virus (PTV) (71) . However, in one study TLR3 did not contribute to viral pathogenesis in VSV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and reovirus infections (72) . To make matters more confusing, TLR3 has been implicated in recognition of DNA viruses. TLR3-deficient mice are more susceptible to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection than wildtype mice (73) . Moreover, a recent human study has demonstrated that a dominant negative form of TLR3 causes susceptibility to neonatal herpes simplex-1 encephalitis (HSE) (74) . However, it is unclear why TLR3 plays such a major role in HSE, whereas it has no obvious role in other HSV-1 infections, such as skin, eye, or mouth infections, or sepsis or in other DNA virus infections. Thus, TLR3 may recognize not only RNA viruses but also DNA viruses, most probably through RNA intermediates that are generated during viral replication.",

Another study showed that TLR3 triggers an inflammatory response against West Nile virus infection that breaks down the bloodbrain barrier, facilitating viral penetration and spreading in the brain and subsequent neuronal damage (70) . Similarly, TLR3 plays an important role in liver pathology caused by PTV infection through the overproduction of inflammatory mediators (71) .

It has been assumed that these sensors activate the same general cytokine responses; however, if the TLR and RLR pathways do indeed produce different cytokine products, then it is likely that they also produce different effects on the subsequent immune response. For example, it is known that the inflammatory cytokines can function not only to limit viral infection but also to cause excessive immunopathology. If we are able to distinguish which receptor is preferentially responsible for the production of each cytokine, then we may be able to target small molecules to the endosomal or cytoplasmic compartments to affect cytokine response.

This is easily seen in comparison between conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDC). cDCs are specialized for pathogen detection and antigen presentation. pDCs specialize in the secretion of type I IFNs in response to viruses (25, 85) . In humans, cDCs express TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, and TLR8, while pDCs preferentially express TLR7 and TLR9. cDCs are capable of expressing high levels of RIG-I and MDA5, while pDCs also express these cytoplasmic sensors, but, paradoxycally, the sensors do not appear to function (86) . Nevertheless, both cell types are able to respond to viruses. In human cDCs, this occurs in an MDA5-and TLR3dependent manner, leading to the production of IFN-b, autocrine activation via IFNAR, and the production of IFN-a. In pDCs, however, TLR3 is not present, MDA5 and RIG-I may not be functional, and autocrine secretion and activation via IFN-b does not occur, but high levels of IFN-a are produced (87) . This occurs because pDCs utilize TLR7 and TLR9 and express endogenously high levels of IRF7 (22) , which primes them for IFN-a production. In this situation, we can see that by varying the expression of TLRs and signaling components, different cell types have unique ways to detect pathogens. Extending this observation, a recent study demonstrated that human neutrophils respond to polyI:C through the RLR pathway rather than the TLR3 pathway (88) .",

It has been demonstrated that MDA5 and RIG-I are the predominant sensors for polyI:C and RNA virus infection in bone marrowderived DCs, macrophages, and fibroblasts. However, TLR3 has also been shown to play a role in different cell types. This may occur as a result of differential expression of the various sensors or their downstream adapter proteins. One specific example may occur in the brain. Several groups have shown that TLR3 is expressed in the brain, while MDA5 does not appear to be expressed. Most probably, this differential expression of the various viral sensors contributes to their importance in viral infection.",

In this review, we examine the diversity of these sensors and the potential explanations for this diversity. The role of each sensor potentially may be distinguished by recognition of distinct viral pathogens, by stimulation of distinct cytokine signaling pathways, or by distribution of individual sensors in different cell and tissue types. Further studies are necessary to determine which of these possibilities most contributes, as well as the role of the individual sensors in viral infection in vivo.",

Three potential mechanisms by which viral sensors perform unique functions: (i) viral sensors detect different ligands resulting in the recognition of a variety of viral families and \u2044 or the recognition of different components of the same virus. (ii) Toll-like receptor (TLR) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor (RLR) signaling results in the production of different cytokine responses (i.e. type I interferon versus pro-inflammatory cytokines). (iii) The expression of TLRs and RLRs in different cell types results in unique responses to viruses in different cells and tissues. Predominant sensors are indicated in bold, while secondary sensors are indicated below in smaller font.",
