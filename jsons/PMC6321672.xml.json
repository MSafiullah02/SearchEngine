            "text": "So far, two well-known models of EcircRNA formation have been proposed, namely the \u2018direct back-splicing\u2019 model and the \u2018exon skipping\u2019 model [7, 20\u201322]. The main difference between the two models is the order in which of the two processes comes first, canonical splicing or back-splicing. In the direct back-splicing model, as the name suggests, back-splicing happens first, and the two introns are paired with complementary motifs, and the 5\u2032 splice donor and the 3\u2032 splice acceptor are juxtaposed to generate EcircRNAs directly. In the exon skipping model, canonical splicing happens first, and exon skipping occurs in the precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) to form a lariat that contains exons. Splicing of the exons before and after the lariat by canonical splicing results in the formation of mature linear RNA, while the excised lariat is then back-spliced to generate EcircRNAs. During the biogenesis of the EcircRNAs, introns may not be spliced out completely but retained between the encircled exons in the newly generated circRNAs. This phenomenon was reported by Li et al. [23] in mammalian cells, and the RNAs were refered to as EIciRNAs, a special subtype of circRNAs. Unlike EcircRNAs and EIciRNAs, the formation of CiRNAs in karyocytes depends mainly on the 7-nucleotide GU-rich motif located at the 5\u2032 splicing site and the 11-nucleotide C-rich motif at the 3\u2032 branch site. During back-splicing, the two elements bind into a lariat-like intermediate, which contains the excised exons and introns, and are cut out by the spliceosome. The stable lariats thereby generated then undergo 3\u2032 tail degradation, which results in the formation of CiRNAs. The unique method by which CiRNAs are formed results in distinct differences from EcircRNAs; CiRNAs are 2\u2032-5\u2032 phospholipid-linked molecules, and EcircRNAs are 3\u2032-5\u2032 phospholipid-linked molecules [24].",

            "text": "Furthermore, back-splicing is considered to be extensively regulated by canonical cis-acting splicing regulatory elements and trans-acting splicing factors. Zhang et al. [25] found that splicing selection and exon circularization are regulated by complementary sequences within or across individual flanking introns. Complementary sequences within individual flanking introns can be sufficient to promote linear mRNA generation, while that across flanking introns can benefit exon circularization. Trans-factors, such as RNA binding proteins (RBPs), reportedly serve a regulatory role in circRNAs biogenesis. For example, Quaking, which play a role in pre-mRNA splicing, binds at a specific sequence on the intron, so that both ends of the loop fragment on the RNA precursor are close to each other and finally form a circRNA by reverse splicing [26]. The MBL protein can bind to the conserved sequence on both the exonic and flanking intronic sequences of MBL pre-mRNA, regulate its own precursor RNA to form circRNAs, and further link the conserved sequence of MBL to a minigene that can sufficiently induce circRNAs biogenesis [27]. Khan et al. [28] also found that RBM20 protein knockout significantly inhibited the formation of myosin complexes. In contrast, a negative correlation between ADARs (Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) and circRNAs biogenesis has also been reported. The silencing of ADAR1 increases the expression of intracellular circRNAs, and the mechanism by which this occurs possibly is associated with the ability of ADAR1 to melt the dsRNA hairpin structure when inverted complementary sequences are present in the flanking introns of circularized exons [29].",

            "text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) with a size of ~ 20 nt, post-transcriptionally regulate the translation of target mRNAs via binding miRNA response elements (MREs). The studies have provided evidences that some of circRNAs harbor MREs, suggesting a potential role as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) that compete for miRNA-binding sites, thereby affecting miRNA activities [30]. In 2013, two different study teams simultaneously demonstrated for the first time that circRNAs function as powerful miRNAs sponges [31, 32]. Both teams found overlapping co-expression of ciRS-7/CDR1as and miR-7 in nerve tissue, suggesting their close interactions in vivo. Other studies have shown that cyclic RNA ciRS-7/CDR1as harbors more than 70 conventional miR-7 binding sites, and thus function as a super-sponge of miR-7. In addition, Hansen et al. [32] found that mouse testicular-specific circRNA (Sry) also function as a sponge that binds to miR-138. The ability of circRNAs\u2019 miRNA-binding capacity is stronger than that of any other ceRNAs; they are therefore known as \u201csuper sponges\u201d.",

[18] discovered that the second exon of the splicing factor MBL could undergo cyclization to form circMbI. The flanking intron of circMbI has a conserved MBL binding site that binds closely to MBL. Changing the expression level of MBL can affect the expression of circMbI, whereas the expression of circMbI changes the competitive regulation of canonical pre-mRNA splicing and thus affects the expression of MBL. Another study confirmed that the formation of myosin circulatory cells in RBM20 knockout mice was significantly reduced, whereas the exon of the myosin circadian antibody was increased in the linear mRNA, suggesting that the process of circRNAs synthesis regulates the process of variable splicing. Many other circRNAs that contain the translation-initiation site possess similar function and act as an mRNA trap to regulate expression of their host genes.",

[36] constructed a miRNA that contains the cytomegalovirus promoter, IRES, and the exon of the GFP, which can be channeled into the cell to form a circRNA. This circRNA can also translate the GFP protein, as evidenced by green fluorescence in the cells. These studies indirectly demonstrate that circRNAs play a role in coding proteins, even though they may be lacking in direct evidence. The three latest studies have directly confirmed that circRNAs in eukaryotic cells can encode proteins. Legnini et al. [37] found that circ-ZNF609 had an open reading frame (ORF), both ends of which contain the start and end codes, respectively, that can transduce the polynucleotide to the protein. Pamudurti et al. [38] defined a group of circRNAs associated with translational ribosomes in Drosophila using ribosome imprinting. Mass spectrometry showed that a circRNA from a blind muscle site could encode a protein. In addition, Yang et al. [39] found that circRNAs were extensively translated by N6-methyladenosine.

Among those methods, RT-PCR is the simplest and fastest way to identify circRNAs. It amplifies and quantifies specific circRNAs with primers for the reverse splice site of the circRNAs. However, template conversion, trans-splicing, and unexpected gene duplication in the reverse transcription process result in false positives from RT-PCR [54]. The exoribonuclease, RNase R, progressively degrades RNA from its 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 end, and is used in combination with RT-PCR to identify the circRNAs. It is also used for purification of circRNAs in sequencing libraries and verification of sequencing results [43]. Northern blotting recognizes the circularized exonic sequence using designed probes, and RNase H is an endoribonuclease that is capable of cleaving RNA at RNA-DNA hybrids. Starke et al. [19] identified EcircRNAs\u2019 closed loop structure by using Northern blotting with RNase H. In addition, RNA-sequencing combined with Northern blotting, can reveal the presence of alternative splicing of circRNAs in different cells, and further demonstrate that such circRNAs retaining part of the intron are the EIciRNAs [55]. In 2D-PAGE, linear RNA migrates along the diagonal of the 2D gel according to its size, whereas circRNA travels in an arc owing to its anomalous migration. Therefore, this method could be an enrichment, quantification and characterization method for circRNAs sequencing [56].",

Wan et al. [57] found that the expression of circ-ITCH was significantly reduced in lung cancer tissues, demonstrating that it functions as a sponge of multiple oncogenic miRNAs, including miR-7 and miR-214, and consequently inhibits lung cancer cell proliferation. The luciferase reporter assay, western blot, and RT-PCR further confirmed that circ-ITCH suppressed the activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling by transcriptionally down-regulating \u03b2-catenin, c-Myc, and cyclin D1. Tian et al.

In addition, Dai et al. [12] demonstrated that circ0006916 was significantly down-regulated in 16HBE-T, A549 and H460 cell lines and acted as a tumor suppressor gene by affecting cell cycle distribution and inhibiting cell proliferation. Further analysis showed that circ0006916 may act by sponging miR-522-3p and its downstream pleckstrin homology domain and leucine rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1). Moreover, trinucleotide repeat-containing 6A (TNRC6A), an RBP, could enhance the production of circ0006916 by binding to recognition elements in the flanking intron.

Levels of hsa_circ_0000064 is found increased in lung cancer tissues and cell lines (A549 and H1229) and its high expression is associated with the T stage, lymphatic metastasis, and TNM stage. Knockdown of hsa_circ_0000064 could suppress cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, alter the cell cycle, with increased expression of bcl-2, and decreased expression of cancer-related proteins involved in cell cycle (p21, CDK6, and cyclin D1) and cell apoptosis (caspase-3, caspase-9, and bax). Furthermore, expression levels of the migration and invasion-related proteins MMP-2 and MMP-9 are significantly reduced when hsa_circ_0000064 is knocked down, suggesting its possible role as an oncogenic circRNA and as a novel promising biomarker and therapeutic target for lung cancer [59]. Another circRNA, circRNA_100876, is significantly upregulated in comparison to paired adjacent non-tumorous tissues among the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues of 101 patients. This circRNA also shows a significant association with lymph node metastasis, advanced tumor staging, and shorter overall survival times of patients with NSCLC [60]. Very recently, Tan et al. [61] found that a fusion circRNA, named as F-circEA, which was generated from the EML4-ALK fusion gene with the function of promoting cell proliferation and migration, and could be detected in the serum of patients with NSCLC who are positive for EML4-ALK.

Previous studies have shown that miRNAs such as miR-155 [62] and miR-17 [63] play a key role in the development and treatment of ALI. As miRNA sponges, circRNAs may help us from a new perspective to develop an effective therapy for ARDS. Wan et al. [64] firstly analyzed the circRNAs expression profiles of lung tissues from rat with LPS-induced ARDS, and identified 395 up- and 562 down-regulated circRNAs. Among them, 4 up-regulated circRNAs (mmu_circRNA_19423, rno_circRNA_010489, rno_circRNA_011426, mmu_circRNA_30664) and 1 down-regulated circRNA (rno_circRNA_005564) exhibited significant validity.

            "text": "Pulmonary hypertension refers to as a hemodynamic and pathophysiological state, in which pulmonary arterial pressure increases above a certain threshold. So far, numerous noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs and miRNAs) have been found to participate in the pathologic process of PH. CircRNAs, as a novel member of the non-coding RNA family, will be an important diagnostic and therapeutic target in PH. To the best of our knowledge, our team was the first to detect dysregulated circRNAs in the lungs of mice with hypoxia-induced PH by performing the circRNAs microarray. Among those detected, 23 significantly upregulated and 41 significantly downregulated circRNAs were identified. In addition, we used circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network analysis, and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis to formulate further insights into the related mechanisms and pathways. Our results suggested that dysregulated circRNAs may play key roles in the pathogenesis of hypoxia-induced PH, and can be potential targets for treatment [15]. Besides, Miao et al. [66] identified 351 (122 upregulated and 229 downregulated) differentially expressed circRNAs in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Furthermore, they found that upregulated circRNAs might function in CTEPH mainly by affecting the ribonucleotide biosynthetic process; whereas downregulated circRNAs may function mainly by regulating the cellular response to stress, DNA damage stimulus, and gene expression. Among them, hsa_circ_0002062 sponges has-miR-942-5p, which is mainly enriched in cancer-related pathways, and hsa_circ_0022342 sponges has-miR-940, which is mainly enriched in the ErbB signaling pathway. These two circRNAs may play key roles in CTEPH development, and their targeted regulation may be an effective approach treating CTEPH. These studies suggested a potential role of circRNAs in the development of PH, but are still in profiling dysregulated circRNAs and lack deeper function and mechanism research.",

            "text": "Pulmonary tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains a serious threat to public health owing to the delay in diagnosis and treatment. However, the current methods for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB are limited for their sensitivity and specificity. Thus, new biomarkers are urgently required to help early diagnosis and treatment for pulmonary TB. Zhang et al. [67] identified 170 dysregulated circRNAs in pulmonary TB, compared with healthy control and constructed ceRNAs. Their findings suggested an important role of circRNA-associated ceRNA-mediated gene regulation in the pathogenesis of pulmonary TB. Huang et al. [68] showed that hsa_circ_001937 present significant value in TB diagnosis (area under the curve = 0.873). It was correlated with TB severity, and served as a TB-specific signature circRNA, showing significantly increased levels in patients with TB, compared to those with pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), and lung cancer. Zhuang et al. [69] found that hsa_circ_0005836 and has-circ-0009128 were significantly down-regulated in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with active pulmonary TB, compared to healthy controls. GO-based enrichment and KEGG analysis showed that major biological functions of differentially expressed circRNAs were related to immune system activation, suggesting a correlation between TB infection and the activity of the immune system. Qian et al. [70] identified the differentially expressed circRNAs in PBMCs of TB patients and chose 7 circRNAs to construct circRNA-based TB index for each subject. The TB index was higher in TB patients than that in healthy control and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.946 in validated groups. Further KEGG analysis showed that several pathways related to inflammation and bacteria invasion were upregulated in active TB patients. Furthermore, Yi et al. [71] determined the plasma circRNA expression profiles of active TB patients and found that hsa_circRNA_103571 exhibited a significant decrease in active TB patients. Further bioinformatics analysis showed that hsa_circRNA_103571 participated into regulation of actin cytoskeleton, T- and B-cell receptor signaling pathway. Previous studies have identified the diagnostic value of some circRNAs in TB infection, and further research may put emphasis on nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTB), which causes tuberculosis-like clinical symptoms and imaging performance, and thus easily results in misdiagnosis and mistreatment. Furthermore, most non-tuberculous mycobacteria are highly resistant to antituberculotic drugs and cause a large disease burden to society. In future, circRNAs may be a new biomarker tohelp physicians better distinguish non-tuberculosis infection from TB.",

            "text": "Silicosis is one of the most common, fastest-growing, and most serious types of pneumoconiosis, characterized by extensive nodular fibrosis in the lungs caused by long-term inhalation of large amounts of free silica dust. At present, circRNAs associated with silicosis have been subjected to in-depth study, mainly by Jie Chao\u2019s research group. They [72] reported that circZC3H4 RNA sponged miR-212 and thereby relieved inhibition of the ZC3H4 protein by miR-212. Increased expression of circZC3H4 RNA and ZC3H4 upon SiO2 exposure can affect macrophages activation and their downstream effects on fibroblast proliferation and migration. Importantly, increased levels of the ZC3H4 protein have been confirmed in tissue samples from patients with silicosis, suggesting that ZC3H4 may be a potential therapeutic target for silicosis. Zhou et al. [14] found that the circHEZCD1/HECTD1 pathway participated in SiO2-induced macrophages activation and increased HECTD1 expression in patients with silicosis. Moreover, reduced levels of circHEZCD1 and increased levels of HECTD1 upon the exposure of SiO2 are regulated by ZC3H12A, a novel RBP. After that, Fang et al. [73] found that circHECTD1 might regulate the protein levels of its host gene, hectd1, through competition with its pre-mRNA. The circHECTD1/HECTD1 pathway, which promotes the endothelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro following SiO2 exposure, may be a possible mechanism of fibrosis and new therapy target in patients with pulmonary silicosis.",

Hoverer, circRNAs have present its potential therapeutic value in different respiratory diseases, especially lung cancer, based on cell and animal models. The native protective circRNAs could be overexpressed via delivering circRNAs plasmids or viruses [76, 77]. Furthermore, with the advent of different methods for RNA circularization, personalized circRNAs could be designed and artificially synthesized according to the need of researchers or clinicians. Liu et al. [78] for the first time artificially synthesized a circRNA to inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cells via sponging miR-21. This study provided a new idea for the clinical application of circRNAs in respiratory diseases in future.

The width and depth of recent studies are limited and there are still many challenges and chances for us to explore the role of circRNAs in respiratory diseases. Firstly, differentially expressed circRNAs have only been identified in lung cancer, ARDS, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary tuberculosis and silicosis. The role of circRNAs in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, bronchiectasis and other pulmonary infectious diseases is completely unknown and required to be identified. Secondly, the molecular mechanisms of circRNAs in different respiratory diseases remain largely elusive. Most of studies only identified differentially expressed circRNAs using the circRNAs microarray or the next-generation gene sequencing, but the function of these circRNAs were not elucidated. Thus, more work is required to demonstrate the functions of these differentially expressed circRNAs in respiratory diseases-related cell and animal models in future. Finally, the circRNAs diagnostic panels and therapeutic methods targeting circRNAs need to be developed. The sensitivity and reliability of circRNAs as biomarkers are required more clinical validation in different respiratory diseases.
