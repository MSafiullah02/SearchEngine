However, the 3 45 development of these potent antibodies during ZIKV natural infection remains 46 unknown. Here, we report on the longitudinal analysis of one such antibody 47 ZK2B10 using next-generation sequencing (NGS), bioinformatics and 48 functional analysis. We found that the ZK2B10 germline-like antibodies 49 possess strong neutralizing activity in vitro and impressive protectivity against 50 lethal ZIKV infection in vivo. These findings suggest that the potent and 51 protective antibody response against ZIKV can be generated within relative 52 short term with high germline identity which provide great hope and promise for 53 successful vaccine development against ZIKV.",

According to the alignment compared to IGHV1-8 266 germline sequence, the functional loss of 2H-2, -3 and -14 could be explained 267 potentially by the mutation of D39 located toward the end of HCDR1 (Fig 3A) . 268 As for 11 synthesized ZK2B10-like \uf06c chains, 7 (2L-1, -2, -3, -6, -8, -9, and -11) 269 were expressible when paired with WT ZK2B10 heavy chain. Surprisingly, 5 270 (2L-1, -3, -8, -9, and -11) of these 7 \uf06c variants failed to bind ZIKV E or E DIII 271 combined with undetectable neutralizing activities against ZIKV (Fig 4B) . (Fig 4D) . The RNA load in these groups was suppressed in blood 307 with distinguishable level from the MERS-4 group (Fig 4F) . Exceptionally, 2H-15 308 2, -3 and -14 failed to offer any protection with a median survival time of 7.25 309 to 8 days after ZIKV challenge (Fig 4D) . The viral RNA levels measured in mice 310 treated by them were 3.72 to 4.45 log 10 greater on average than the ZK2B10 311 group on day 5 after ZIKV challenge, respectively (Fig 4F) . In contrast, all of Critical residues for ZK2B10 functional maturation 319 To the further investigation of the maturation pathway of the ZK2B10 lineage, 320 we performed reverse mutagenesis and structural analysis to identify 'hotspot' 321 residues. Before that, we aligned the amino acid sequences of representative 322 ZK2B10 heavy and \uf06c chain variants with their putative germline genes, IGHV1-323 8 and IGLV1-47, respectively (Fig 3) . For heavy chain, 2H-2, 2H-3, and 2H-14 324 lose their potency to ZIKV both in vitro and in vivo. These 3 heavy chains 325 possess a single substitution mutation at the D39 with respect to their germline 326 gene (Fig 3A) . To test that, we conducted reverse mutagenesis on 2H-2 (A39D), (Fig 3B) . One such mutation, located on the 343 LCDR1 loop, is N31, which is shared by the weak-functional variants 2L-2 and 344 2L-6, as well as WT ZK2B10 \uf06c chain (Fig 3B) . The other is at position 91 on 345 LCDR3 loop, which is S91 in WT ZK2B10 \uf06c chain but predominantly A91 in all 346 these weak-or non-functional \uf06c chain variants (Fig 3B) . Thus, N31N and S91 347 could be the critical mutations for ZK2B10 \uf06c chain maturation. We first 348 examined the effect of these two mutations individually by performing site-349 directed mutagenesis on 2L-1, which is 100% identical to germline gene 350 IGLV1-47. Neither S31N nor A91S could effectively render the germline 351 antibody functional (Fig 5B) . We then introduced a double mutation 17 352 (S31N+A91S) into 2L-1, which, as expected, bound to ZIKV E and E DIII with 353 high affinity and potently neutralized ZIKV at the same level of WT ZK2B10 (Fig   354   5B ). As shown by the crystal structure, 5 residues within ZK2B10 \uf06c chain (N31, 355 N32, Y33, R51, D94 and L96) directly involved in the in the contact interface 356 [31]. For the two identified critical residues, N31 directly interacts with T309 on 357 ZIKV E DIII, while S91 forms a hydrogen bond with N32, which interacts with 358 T335 on ZIKV E DIII (Fig 5D) . In brief, our combined analyses of NGS data, 359 antibody functions, and complex structure confirm that residues N31 and S91 Committee of Tsinghua University (16-ZLQ9).",

The unbiased repertoire analysis 30 showed dramatic changes in many families of heavy and light chain variable 31 regions. However, lineage tracing of ZK2B10 revealed limited somatic 32 hypermutation throughout the 12 months since the onset of symptom.

Currently, no ZIKV-specific therapeutics or vaccines are 71 available. The high prevalence of the vectors and the continuing evolution of 72 viral species raised serious public health concerns in the near future [11]. 73 The surface envelope glycoprotein (E) of flaviviruses mediates entry and 74 presents a potential target of neutralizing antibodies. Numbers of E-targeting 75 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been identified with potent neutralizing 76 activity and epitope specificity [12-29]. Previously, we isolated and 77 characterized a panel of E-targeting mAbs from plasma and memory B cells 78 from sequential blood samples of a DENV-na\u00efve ZIKV-infected convalescent 79 patient (Pt1) who acquired ZIKV infection in Venezuela during the 2016 80 outbreak and then returned to China [6, 24]. Among them, ZK2B10 is the most 81 potent in neutralizing ZIKV and have no detectable reactivity with DENV 1 or 2 82 [24]. ZK2B10 also demonstrated complete prophylactic and impressive 83 therapeutic activities against lethal ZIKV challenge in mouse models of ZIKV 84 infection and microcephaly [30]. Crystal structure and cryo-EM analysis reveal 85 that ZK2B10 recognizes the lateral ridge of DIII and blocks infection at steps 86 between post-attachment and membrane fusion [31]. Since ZK2B10 could 87 serve as a promising candidate for antibody-based interventions, the ontogeny 5 88 of ZK2B10 could gain insight into the protective antibody response after ZIKV 89 natural infection, as well as inform rational vaccine design. Furthermore, up to 90 date, diverse vaccine candidates are capable of conferring complete protection 91 against ZIKV challenge in mice or nonhuman primates (NHPs) have been 92 evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies [16, 32, 33]. It is therefore 93 imperative to investigate the dynamic and characteristic of antibody repertoire 94 across ZIKV infection longitudinally, which will provide insights into its 95 pathogenesis and the molecular requirement for the development of an 96 effective ZIKV vaccine.",

We obtained tens of millions of antibody 101 sequences from a total of seven sequential time points including Day 4, Day 102 15, Month 2, Month 3, Month 6, Month 10 and Month 12 after the onset of 103 symptoms. We first performed longitudinal analysis of the antibody repertoire, 104 focusing on germline gene usage, CDR3 loop length, and degree of somatic 105 hypermutation (SHM). Our data revealed the antibody repertoire profiles of 106 ZIKV infection with diverse usage of antibody germline gene combined with 107 steady CDR3 loop length, making a clear distinction to chronic HIV infection, 108 which exhibited highly matured repertoire profiles with enrichment of specific 109 germline gene and long HCDR3 loop length [34, 35] . The emerging of 6 110 germline-like antibodies was observed on Day 15 after symptom onset. We 111 further traced the antibody lineage of ZK2B10 and investigated the maturation 112 pathway. Our results show that ZK2B10 generated in relatively small numbers 113 and grouped with highly germline-like antibodies identified at Day 15 after the 114 onset of symptoms. The somatic variants of ZK2B10 further synthesized for 115 functional characterizations both in vitro and in vivo. Germline-like heavy chain 116 somatic variants demonstrated strong neutralizing activity and protective 117 potential in lethal ZIKV challenge mouse model. While two substitutions of 118 ZK2B10 \uf06c chain, N31 on LCDR1 and S91 on LCDR3, were identified as the 119 critical residues for ZK2B10 functional maturation. Taken together, our 120 repertoire analyses and lineage tracing elucidated the maturation pathways of 121 potent and protective antibody ZK2B10, and highlighted germline-like 122 antibodies play a noticeable role in protective immunity against ZIKV infection. 123 Results 124 Dynamic B cell repertoire response throughout ZIKV infection 125 Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for probing antibody 126 responses to natural infection and vaccination [36-38]. Extensive studies of 127 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and their lineage development using 128 NGS have revealed the underappreciated complexity and diversity of B cell 129 repertoires in HIV-1-infected individuals during chronic infection [39-42]. Here, 130 we performed a longitudinal NGS analysis of antibody repertoire in Pt1 to 131 delineate the dynamic B cell response to ZIKV infection following the procedure 7 132 highlighted in Fig 1A. We analyzed seven sequential time points from the acute 133 phase (Day 4 and Day 15 after the onset of symptoms) to the convalescent 134 phase (Month 2, 3, 6, 10 and 12 after the onset of symptoms). We combined 135 5'-RACE polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single reverse primers in 136 template preparation to ensure the NGS in an long-read (600 bp) and unbiased 137 manner as previously reported (S1 Fig.) [34, 43-46].

The 282 loss of function observed for most \uf06c chain somatic variants, in which V L was 283 reverted to IGLV1-47, suggested that light chain maturation is crucial for the 284 ZK2B10 lineage to acquire its potency and specificity, reminiscent of the case 285 of the HIV-1 bNAb, VRC01 [44]. 14 286 287 Protective potential of ZK2B10 somatic variants in a mouse model 288 Previously, we have demonstrated ZK2B10 can protect mouse from lethal ZIKV 289 infection and microcephaly [24, 30]. Such animal study will not only confirm the 290 accuracy of our repertoire analyses but also provide clues as to the functional 291 diversity of the ZK2B10 lineage in vivo.

As expected, in vivo 302 protection of mAbs was correlated with their in vitro neutralization, as 303 previously reported [30]. For example, the heavy chain variants with potent 304 neutralizing activities in vitro (2H-1, -4, -6, -9, -10, -15 and -16) provided 305 complete protection with a survival rate of 100% up to 14 days after ZIKV 306 challenge",

The comprehensive analyses 365 showed antibody repertoire profiles with diverse germline usage, lower IgG 366 somatic hypermutation rate and steady CDR3 loop length. The tracking of 367 ZK2B10 revealed the dynamic of an effective germline-coded antibody lineage, 368 which emerged preluding the convalescent phase of ZIKV infection. Germline-369 like somatic variants derived from ZK2B10 lineage neutralized ZIKV potently 370 and protected mice from lethal challenge, while demonstrated no cross-371 reactivity with DENV2. The in-depth analyses showed that two site-372 mutagenesis of IGLV1-47 germline-coded \uf06c chain, N31 and S91, are essential 373 to the functional maturation of IGHV1-8/IGLV1-47 antibody lineage. 18 374 Two unique aspects of our study are worth highlighting here. One is based 375 on the effective germline-coded antibody response represented by ZK2B10 376 lineage. We report here that there was a significant increase in germline-like 377 antibodies at Day 15 after the onset of symptoms. This drastic shift in repertoire 378 composition was likely a result of rapid plasmablast response toward the end 379 of the acute phase of ZIKV infection. Interestingly, this shift was coincided with 380 the emergence of the ZK2B10 lineage, which provides a perfect introduction to 381 understand the germline-coded antibody response during ZIKV natural 382 infection. Similar patterns have been reported in separate antibody studies. For 383 monoclonal antibodies, germline-like human mAbs, m301 and m302, were 384 reported that target ZIKV E DIII cryptic epitopes (C-C' loop) and neutralize ZIKV 385 potently both in vitro and in vivo [22]. Another human mAb, P1F12, originates 386 from germline gene IGHV3-7 with an identity of 100% and neutralizes ZIKV 387 potently as well [51]. For the overall B cell response, plasmablast-derived 388 antibodies from ZIKV-infected, DENV-na\u00efve donor showed low levels of SHM, 389 supporting the mechanism of na\u00efve B cell activation [19]. Lower IgG somatic 390 hypermutation rates also reported during acute DENV infection, which is 391 consistent with an innate-like antiviral recognition mediated by B cells using 392 defined germline-coded B cell receptors [52]. Therefore, the inducing of 393 germline-coded neutralizing antibodies occupies critical positon in the B cell 394 response during acute flavivirus infection. Diverse mechanisms of antibody 395 lineage development were found in chronic infection, especially in HIV studies. 19 396 The initiation and early development of MPER-directed HIV antibody lineage 397 have been reported to achieve high neutralizing breadth with low mutation from 398 germline [53]. In a stark contrast, HIV-1 bNAbs VRC01 and PGT121, which 399 target CD4 binding-site and V3 region respectively, require extensive mutation 400 to achieve neutralizing breadth and potency and possess long HCDR3 loops 401 to penetrate the glycan shield of the HIV-1 envelope spike [34, 44]. In summary, 402 our longitudinal analysis of antibody repertoire and lineage development 403 provides critical insights into the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection. 404 The other unique aspect of our study was the assist in the rational design 405 of a safe and effective vaccine. As we previously reported that ZK2B10, as well 406 as other E DIII-specific mAbs, are ZIKV-specific, potent neutralizing and 407 protective in mice from a lethal ZIKV challenge [18, 23, 24, 30]. The identified 408 epitope reveal that ZK2B10 bind to residues within the lateral ridge of DIII and 409 blocks infection at a post-attachment step as other E DIII-specific potent 410 neutralizing mAbs [31, 47]. Beyond that, DIII-specific antibodies give essential 411 contribution to controlling ZIKV as they correlated positively with high 412 neutralization titers and the depletion of them results in reduced neutralizing 413 activity in ZIKV-infected patient serum [24, 47]. We also report here that only 414 two site-mutagenesis of IGLV1-47 germline \uf06c chain, N31 and S91, are 415 sufficient for IGHV1-8/IGLV1-47 germline antibodies to achieve potent ZIKV 416 neutralization. This barrier could overcome readily by an active B cell repertoire. 417 The low degree of SHM observed for the ZK2B10 lineage suggests that 20 418 elicitation of na\u00efve protective B cell response against ZIKV may be achievable 419 with a standard vaccination regimen. Furthermore, E DIII-based vaccine has 420 been reported to avert lethal West Nile virus (WNV) infection without enhancing 421 ZIKV or DENV infectivity [54]. However, the low frequency and transient 422 expansion of ZK2B10-like antibodies in the Pt1 repertoire suggest that 423 overcoming the suboptimal immunogenicity of ZIKV E DIII, an elongated 424 immunoglobulin-like domain, may prove to be a challenge for samples were donated by a 28-year-old Chinese ZIKV convalescent 429 male patient (Pt1) who traveled from Venezuela to the southern metropolitan 430 city Guangzhou, China, in February, 2016 [6].

            "text": "). The IgG concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). We included previously reported MERS-CoV-specific mAb MERS-4 [50] for comparative analysis.ZIKV E and ZIKV E DIII protein and ELISA analysesThe genes of either E protein or E DIII protein (residues 301-403) of ZIKV 501 (GZ01, KU820898) without tag were cloned into pET28a vectors (Novagen) and expressed by IPTG-induction in BL21 (RIL) bacterial cells. The isolated inclusion bodies were solubilized and re-folded as reported[55]. In ELISA binding assays, the E proteins and E DIII proteins were captured separately onto ELISA plates overnight at 4 \u00baC. Each tested mAb was serially diluted and applied to the ZIKV E and E DIII protein-captured ELISA plates. Binding activities were detected using anti-human IgG labeled with HRP and TMB AF204178) viruses were grown in C6/36 Aedes Albopictus cells and titrated on Vero cells before use. For neutralization assay, serial dilutions of mAbs were mixed with virus at 4 \u00baC for 1 hour before being applied to Vero cells in the 6well culture plates. After 1-2 hour of infection, the antibody-virus mixture was aspirated and Vero cells were washed with PBS and overlaid with DMEM containing 2% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% SeaPlaque Agarose (Lonza, 50501). After 4-6 days, plaques were stained by 1% crystal violet and counted",
