Hence, short peptide (10\u201320 residues) vaccine candidates are considered promising solutions in recent years. These function on the principle of short epitopes developed through the binding of CD8+/CD4+-specific HLA alleles (12542 known so far). Thus, the specific binding of short peptide antigens to HLA alleles is rate limiting with high sensitivity in producing T-cell-mediated immune responses. Identification of HLA allele-specific antigen peptide binding is mathematically combinatorial and thus complex. Therefore, prediction of HLA allele-specific peptide binding is critical. Recent advancement in immune-informatics technologies with the aid of known X-ray-determined HLA-peptide structure data provides solutions for the accurate identification of short peptides as vaccine candidates for further consideration. Thus, we document the possibilities and challenges in the prediction, large-scale screening, development, and validation of short peptide vaccine candidates in this chapter.",

However, these types of vaccine technologies may prove unsuitable against some viruses. In some cases, there is interest in the development of short peptide vaccines to fill the gaps. For example, the use of live attenuated HIV-1/AIDS vaccines is not as yet approved due to safety concerns [1]. There are several subunit vaccines under consideration and evaluation. However, one of these, the NIAID and Merck Co.-sponsored 2004 STEP (HVTN 502 or Merck V520-023) trial using three recombinant adenovirus-5 (rAD5) vectors containing HIV-1 genes Ad5-gag, Ad5-pol, and Ad5-Nef, did not show promising results [2]. This has led to the development of a multifaceted strategy for HIV-1/AIDS vaccine development. However, encouraging results were observed with four priming injections of a recombinant canary pox vector (ALVAC-HIV) and two booster injections of gp120 subunit (AIDSVAX-B/E) in a community-based, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy trial (NCT00223080) in Thailand [3]. The main concern following this study was that this vaccine did not affect the degree of viremia or the CD4 T-cell count in patients who later seroconverted. Further studies indicated that the challenges with the development of an HIV-1/AIDS vaccine are viral diversity and host-virus molecular mimicry [4\u20136]. Nonetheless, there is considerable amount of interest to develop gp160 (gp120-gp41 complex) TRIMER envelope (ENV) protein as a potential vaccine candidate [4].",

This was an important development in the field and the approach was extended to a large dataset of known HLA-binding peptides. Kangueane et al. [20] collected over 126 class I peptides with known IC50 values from literature with defined HLA allele specificity. These peptides were modeled using available templates for a large-scale assessment of peptide binding to defined HLA alleles. Thus, a structural framework was established for discriminating allele-specific binders from non-binders using rules derived from a dataset of HLA-peptide complexes. This procedure was promising.",

These studies lead to a detailed analysis of the HLA-peptide interface at the groove and the importance of peptide side chain and backbone atomic interactions were realized [22]. Meanwhile, the amount of structural data on HLA-peptide complexes was increasing in size leading to the development of an online database [23]. Thus, information gleaned from HLA-peptide structural complexes helped to identify common pockets among alleles in the binding groove and provided insights into functional overlap among them [24]. The need for a simple, robust, generic HLA-peptide binding prediction was evident. Therefore, a model was formulated by defining virtual pockets at the peptide-binding groove using information gleaned from a structural dataset of HLA-peptide complexes [25]. The model (average accuracy of 60 %) was superior because of its application to any given class I allele whose sequence is clearly defined. The model (53 % accuracy) was then extended for class II prediction using a class II-specific HLA-peptide structural dataset [26].",

Nonetheless, it was observed that alleles are covered within few HLA supertypes, where different members of a supertype bind similar peptides, yet exhibiting distinct repertoires [29]. These principles led to the development of frameworks to group alleles into HLA supertypes [30, 31], understand their structural basis [32], and cluster alleles based on electrostatic potential at the groove [33]. These observations should aid in the design of peptide vaccine candidates for viruses including HIV/AIDS [5, 6]. Further, for example, the importance of protein modifications to enhance HIV-1 ENV trimer spike protein vaccine across multiple clades, blood, and brain is discussed [4]. Currently available types of vaccine technology [34, 35], such as live virus, killed virus, and conjugate vaccines, have failed to produce a promising vaccine against several clinically important viruses, including HIV/AIDS [36]. Therefore, short peptide vaccines are promising solutions for viral vaccine development. It should be noted that there are many other viruses for which vaccines are needed. Examples of additional viruses for which there are no vaccines available, vaccines are still under development, vaccine failures occurred, or more effective vaccines are needed include RSV, measles, HBV, WNV, Coronaviruses, H5N1 influenza virus, HCV, Adenovirus, Hantavirus, and Filoviruses [37\u201347].",

HLA molecules are specific within ethnic populations and are polymorphic with more than 12542 known alleles as of March 2015. Thus, the binding of short peptide antigens to HLA alleles is rate limiting yet specific, with high sensitivity, while producing T-cell-mediated immune responses. Our understanding of this specific peptide binding to HLA alleles has improved using known HLA-peptide complexes. There is a search for superantigen peptides covering major HLA supertypes.
