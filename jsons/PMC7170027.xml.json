COVID-19 is associated with myocardial injury in a significant proportion of patients.1 Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a valuable bedside tool and may be useful in the cardiovascular assessment of some COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, repeated advancing and withdrawing of the TEE probe through the aerodigestive tract during a typical TEE examination makes it an aerosol-generating medical procedure.2,3 It also risks droplet and contact contamination.",

Prior to insertion, the laparoscopy camera sleeve is mounted on the TEE probe to cover the handle. The bite block/mouthpiece is secured to the stretchable distal end of the camera sleeve, which is reinforced with the tapes incorporated into the sleeve itself. While wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, the echocardiographer places the bite block/mouthpiece into the patient\u2019s mouth and the TEE examination is performed by manipulating the probe through the sleeve (Figure B). After the examination is completed, the TEE probe is removed from the patient and completely withdrawn in the laparoscopy sleeve. The mouthpiece is then carefully withdrawn from the patient and \u201cinvaginated\u201d into the sleeve.",
