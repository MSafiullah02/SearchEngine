Techniques such as specialized flow cytometry [1], dynamic light scattering [2], quantitative capillary electrophoresis [3], and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy [4] can determine the number of particles in a sample within hours. The choice of technique depends on the sort of virus and the matrix in which it is suspended. All aforementioned techniques differentiate particles on the basis of physical properties such as size or antibody affinity. As a consequence particle analysis cannot differentiate infectious from noninfectious virus particles.",

            "text": "There is only one technique available that can reliably quantify the number of infectious particles in a sample. This technique, developed many decades ago [5], exploits the fact that virus can propagate in biological systems such as embryonated eggs or cell cultures. Propagation of a virus is generally accompanied by changes in cell morphology (referred to as cytopathic effect or CPE), which can be visualized using a microscope, or even by eye. Some viruses do not induce CPE, in which case an antibody based assay (immunofluorescence or ELISA) is needed to determine presence or absence of virus. During a titration assay, tissue cultures or embryonated eggs are incubated with tenfold serial dilutions of a virus containing sample and several days later the cytopathic effect is scored. From these scores, the virus titer is calculated using the methods described by Spearman and Kaerber [6, 7] or Reed and Muench [8]. The virus titer is defined as the reciprocal of the dilution at which 50 % of the inoculated embryos or tissue cultures show CPE. In this chapter we use the method of Spearman and Kaerber to calculate the titer, as this calculation can cope with unequal group sizes. Unequal group sizes frequently arise when eggs are lost to aspecific death of the embryo or bacterial infection.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses in general have a narrow host range and many clinical isolates only replicate in primary cells. Replication of most field isolates of infectious bronchitis coronavirus is restricted to embryonated eggs or tracheal organ culture. Most isolates, however, can be adapted to propagation in primary chicken kidney (CK) cells. Adaptation typically requires several passages and selects for viral subpopulations and can induce mutations [9]. Passaging of IBV in either embryonated eggs or primary cell cultures leads to attenuation of the virus in vivo [10\u201312]. The most striking example is the IBV Beaudette strain, which has been passaged hundreds of times in eggs and primary chicken kidney cells [13, 14]. Although IBV Beaudette propagates very well on eggs, CK cells and even in Vero cells, the virus is highly attenuated in vivo and vaccination using Beaudette provides little protection against infection with pathogenic strains of IBV [15].",

When titrating such viruses, the eggs are incubated for an additional 2\u20133 days post inoculation. Candle the eggs at the end of the incubation period to identify embryos that have died. Subsequently, collect allantoic fluid of each of the surviving embryos and test them in a monoclonal based antigen capture ELISA as described in refs. [16, 17]. Dead embryos and those of which the allantoic fluid contains IBV as established by ELISA are considered positive.IBV titers usually do not exceed 108.8 TCID50/ml. Therefore 10\u22128 should be adequate as highest dilution. When the virus titer of the sample is known, select a number of tenfold dilutions (at least three) that include the 50 % end-point dilution. If the titer is unknown, select a broader range of tenfold dilutions that most likely include the 50 % end-point dilution. For a TCID50 titration typically all the wells of the 96-well plate are usedAlternative methods also exist for mixing media and agar. If there is concern regarding the overlay setting too quickly or risk of contamination from the water bath, hot agar can be mixed directly with cold media (4 \u00b0C). Once the mixture feels warm to the touch, rather than hot, it can be added to cells.The simplest method for removing agar from the cells is to hold the plate upside down with the lid removed. The small spatula is inserted between the agar and the wall of the well. Once the base of the well is reached, a small amount of pressure is applied to remove the agar, being careful not to scrape off the cells. The whole agar plug should then fall out easily.\n",
