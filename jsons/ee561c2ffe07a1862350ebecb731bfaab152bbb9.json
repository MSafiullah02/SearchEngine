In total, 40 of 65 patients (65.6%) in the case group had comorbidities; the most prevalent of these were hypertension (36.9%), cardiovascular disease (18.5%), and diabetes (18.5%). Approximately one-third of patients (33.8%) had COVID-19 at the time of admission. 3 The nosocomial infection rate among COVID-19 patients was 7.1% (65 of 918). The most common nosocomial infection was pneumonia (32.3%), followed by bacteremia (24.6%), and urinary tract infection (21.5%). In total, among the 43 pathogens isolated from nosocomial infections, 17 were gram-positive bacteria, 21 were gramnegative bacteria, and 5 were fungi. Onset of nosocomial infection occurred as early as day 7 of the course of illness and as late as day 22, with an average of 14.3 \u00b1 8 d. The mortality of COVID-19 patients with nosocomial infection was 15.4%, significantly higher than that of COVID-19 patients without nosocomial infection (7.3%; odds ratio [OR], 3.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-4.16; P = .045). For multivariable analysis, the dependent variable was nosocomial infection status and independent variables were all factors that demonstrated statistical significance, as mentioned with univariate analysis. Significant predictors of nosocomial infection after adjustment for other covariates were invasive devices (OR, 4.28; 95% CI, 2.47-8.61; P =.007) followed by diabetes (OR,: 3.06, 95% CI, 1.41-7.22; P =.037), and combination of antibiotics (OR, 1.84, 95% CI, 1.31-4.59; P = .003) (Supplementary Table 1 online).",

Rational utilization of antibiotics and steroids to treat patients with COVID-19 is important in preventing nosocomial infection, and special attention should be given to diabetic patients and patients with invasive devices (ie, CVC or PICC). Future studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of implementing infection control strategies or protocols on COVID-19 patients to achieve better therapeutic outcomes. ",
