SARS-CoV-2 mainly causes respiratory and digestive tract symptoms,2 with symptoms ranging from mild self-limited disease to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and even systemic multiple organ failure syndrome. The infection source of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Asymptomatic infected patients may also become the source of infection, mainly via aerosols from the respiratory tract, but also through direct contact.3 Elderly people with underlying diseases are more likely to be infected with the virus and develop severe disease and children and infants are also at risk. At present, there are no specific drugs for this disease. The treatment and nursing mainly include antiviral and traditional Chinese medicine treatment, isolation, symptomatic support, and close monitoring of disease progression.3\n",

In this context, medical workers, as the main force in the battle against the epidemic, bear the monumental task. Unfortunately, many front-line personnel have sacrificed their own well-being and have been infected or died, which causes increasing psychological pressure. According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, by 11 February, over 3000 health care personnel in China were suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Among them, 1716 were confirmed cases and 5 had died.6 Previous studies have shown that during sudden natural disasters and infectious diseases, nurses will sacrifice their own needs to actively participate in the anti-epidemic work and make selfless contributions out of moral and professional responsibility.7 At the same time, nurses would be in a state of physical and mental stress and feel isolated and helpless in the face of health threats and pressure from the high-intensity work caused by such public health emergencies.8 Previous studies have shown that when nurses are in close contact with patients with emerging infectious diseases such as SARS,9 MERS-Cov,10\n,\n11 Ebola,12 H1N1,13 they will suffer from loneliness, anxiety, fear, fatigue, sleep disorders, and other physical and mental health problems. Studies have shown that the incidence of depression, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress among nurses involved in the treatment of SARS patients was 38.5%, 37%, and 33%, respectively.14 In a study on the psychological status of Ebola patients\u2019 caregivers, 29% of respondents felt lonely and 45% received psychological counselling.15 On the contrary, some studies also demonstrate the positive experience and growth brought by the collective anti-epidemic efforts.13\n,\n16\n",

Because COVID-19 is a new disease and the medical system and culture of different countries varies, further research is needed on the psychological experience of frontline nurses fighting against COVID-19. Currently, published studies have highlighted the disease prevalence,17 clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment.2 Some reports have paid attention to the severity of psychological problems in medical personnel18 and the urgency of providing psychological care19.
