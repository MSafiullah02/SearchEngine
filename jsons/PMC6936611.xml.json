            "text": "Seasonal influenza costs lots of lives throughout the world every year, causing a huge economic burden to society, involving treatment costs and productivity losses. Costs due to seasonal influenza have been reported as 2\u20136% of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), compared to only 0.04\u20130.13% of GDP in developed or high-income countries [1,2]. There are four main types of influenza viruses, A, B, C and D, that have been identified so far [3], among which influenza A and B viruses are the most common among humans that cause seasonal epidemics worldwide; however, circulation patterns and strain prevalence can be region-specific and time-specific [4]. According to a report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [5], the United States 2017\u20132018 influenza season (1 October 2017 to 19 May 2018) faced severity from both influenza viruses; influenza A viruses prevailed at the beginning of the season but influenza B predominated in the later part of the season. As reported by previous studies, influenza A viruses have two strain subtypes, H1N1 and H3N2, influenza B viruses have two subtypes\u2014B/Victoria and B/Yamagata\u2014that have been commonly found to circulate [6,7].",

            "text": "Annual vaccination against influenza is suggested to be the most effective strategy to protect from the influenza disease. The traditional trivalent (TIV) vaccine targets three strain subtypes of influenza viruses (two strains of A and one of the B virus strains); on the other hand, the quadrivalent (QIV) vaccine contains one extra strain of influenza B viruse that offers improved protection against influenza B virus infections [3]. Each year public health authorities recommend which strain should be contained in vaccines for the upcoming season (for example [5,8] for USA). However, due to the mismatch between the recommended B virus strain for TIV vaccine and the circulating virus strain, influenza morbidity may increase [4,9]. Inclusion of an extra B strain to QIV vaccine provides better efficacy than that of TIV vaccine. Because they provide better protection, some of the developed countries have been turning towards QIV vaccines, although TIV vaccines are still recommended [8]. Nonetheless, many other countries including Russia are still relying on TIV vaccine [4]. Moreover, the use of QIV vaccine can be substantially expensive compared to TIV and may impose a considerable economic burden on LMICs, although the long-term impact of implementing QIV can be cost-effective [2,10].",

            "text": "So far, a significant amount of research has been conducted investigating the cost-effectiveness of TIV and QIV vaccine usages for developed countries and LMICs [2,10\u201313]. Most of these studies used an individual-based dynamic simulation model (4flu) using demographic data to evaluate the impact of TIV and QIV vaccines. However, in addition to those analyses, we also need to ponder individualistic assessment on choosing vaccine types (when both vaccines are available) as vaccination is usually voluntary in a social perspective. Thus, we need to consider individual perception on taking the vaccination with disease spreading to have a better understanding of the immunization programme. Here, we attempt to analyse people's vaccination decision (TIV or QIV or none) depending upon cost, effectiveness and other factors in the framework of a vaccination game [14\u201330] and then illustrate the resulting impact in a societal perspective. The vaccination game allows a framework that elucidates behaviour\u2013disease\u2013vaccination interactions with the help of evolutionary game theory [31\u201334], which has been used to study the conflict between self-interest and social interest in various circumstances [35\u201338]. Individuals who commit to vaccination (cooperators) can benefit themselves as well as their surroundings; however, people who do not vaccinate (defectors), expose themselves to the risk of infection that may cause illness and more financial burden compared to the vaccination cost, or they may become free riders, benefiting from \u2018herd immunity\u2019 that can be attained from the situation when a larger portion of the population is vaccinated. This scenario creates a social dilemma that can be explained by the vaccination game [35,39]. In this work, we design a mean-field vaccination game in an infinite and well-mixed population, with three strategies: taking QIV vaccine, TIV vaccine, and neither QIV nor TIV. Our approach follows a similar avenue to that of Kuga & Tanimoto [16], where the vaccination is assumed to be pre-emptive. Notably, the authors in [16] successfully developed an equivalent mean-field framework of a vaccination game, taking inspiration from [40], which mainly focused on a networked population. A similar work related to [40] can be found in [41]. The number of vaccinees remains the same during an epidemic season as we are considering seasonal influenza. Moreover, as influenza vaccines are not perfectly effective [42], we take into account vaccine efficacy in our modelling. The assumption of imperfect vaccine in the vaccination game can tackle more realistic situations, and lead to interesting results, which otherwise can be intractable (for instance, see [43,44]). In our current setting, at the end of each season, individuals assess their perceived payoffs based on the previous season's experience in terms of vaccine efficacy, cost, etc., and decide whether to vaccinate or not or if vaccinating then which vaccine to take for the next season. The strategy adaptation after each season is based on imitating others' strategy with better payoffs. The group who chooses QIV vaccine are expected to get better protection against the disease than that of the group taking TIV vaccine, although this may depend on the circulation of influenza B virus. However, the cost for TIV vaccine should be no more than the cost for QIV vaccine. Taking into account all these factors, we combine the disease spreading dynamics of influenza with the vaccination decision-making process through an evolutionary framework. We perform our simulations for repeated seasons until we reach a social equilibrium (steady state). By varying vaccine effectiveness and cost level, our numerical simulations intend to show an overall picture of influenza epidemics. At equilibrium, we calculate to what extent the average social payoff attained from the vaccination game falls short from the desired or social optimum payoff, which we name as, \u2018social efficiency deficit\u2019. Moreover, our approach has been validated with the multi-agent simulation (MAS) approach. We also explore the robustness of our framework in explaining the situation with influenza A or B virus-dominant circulation.",

            "text": "The first stage of our dynamical system is the disease spreading process that is based on a SIR-like model coupled with vaccination. Initially, we divide the whole population into three categories: susceptible (unvaccinated) denoted by S, QIV vaccinees denoted by VQ and TIV vaccinees denoted by VT. It is not usually recommended to take both vaccines (TIV and QIV) in a single season [46]; therefore, we disregard any group taking both vaccines in the same season. As influenza vaccines are not 100% perfect, we consider imperfect vaccinations in our disease modelling, where both vaccines are presumed to provide the same level of efficiency against A virus but different efficacies against B virus. The inclusion of these parameters allows us to consider some individuals from vaccinated groups who fail to get immunity from vaccination (QIV or TIV) and still face the risk of infection like susceptible. The unvaccinated or vaccinated people who fail to get immunity may become infected with either influenza virus (A or B), and then these infected people transfer to the recovery state after suffering from illness. Therefore, at time t, an individual can be at any of the six compartments: susceptible, S(t); QIV vaccinees, VQ(t); TIV vaccinees, VT(t); infected with influenza A, IA(t); infected with influenza B, IB(t); recovered state, R(t). We presume eQ (0 \u2264 eQ \u2264 1) as the vaccine efficacy of QIV against both influenza A and B viruses. As TIV (QIV) vaccine contains two strains of influenza A virus and one (two) strain(s) of influenza B virus, we assume that both QIV and TIV vaccines bestow the same level of effectiveness (eQ (0 \u2264 eQ \u2264 1)) against influenza A but TIV vaccine provides relatively lower effectiveness, eT (0 \u2264 eT \u2264 eQ) against influenza B than that of QIV vaccine. If VQ(0) is the fraction of vaccinees at the beginning of an epidemic season, then a proportion eQ of VQ(0) i.e. eQVQ(0) gets perfect immunity from QIV vaccine and, the remaining fraction, VQ(t) \u2212 eQVQ(0) becomes vulnerable to the disease, where VQ(t) is the fraction of vaccinators in the VQ compartment at time t. A similar logic has been used for TIV vaccinees. The transmission rates and recovery rates for influenza A and B viruses are assumed \u03b2A, \u03b3A and \u03b2B, \u03b3B, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the state space variables represent several fractions of the total population; therefore, we are not considering a population of any particular size. Although coinfection and superinfection with two influenza viruses are possible in some cases [47,48], the incidence rate is not so significant. Therefore, our model disregards the incidence of coinfection and superinfection with two influenza viruses (A and B) and presumes long-term cross-immunity between them. Although we assume long-term cross-immunity between two viruses, short-term immunity is possible in reality. The incidence of short-term cross-immunity between two viruses may allow some individuals recovered from one virus to be infected with the other one after a short time interval (e.g. [49]). The schematic of our epidemic model is given in the disease spreading part of figure 1. The model equations are given by\n2.1dS(t)dt=\u2212\u03b2AS(t)IA(t)\u2212\u03b2BS(t)IB(t),dVQ(t)dt=\u2212\u03b2A(VQ(t)\u2212eQVQ(0))IA(t)\u2212\u03b2B(VQ(t)\u2212eQVQ(0))IB(t),dVT(t)dt=\u2212\u03b2A(VT(t)\u2212eQVT(0))IA(t)\u2212\u03b2B(VT(t)\u2212eTVT(0))IB(t),dIA(t)dt=\u03b2AS(t)IA(t)+\u03b2A(VQ(t)\u2212eQVQ(0))IA(t)+\u03b2A(VT(t)\u2212eQVT(0))IA(t)\u2212\u03b3AIA(t),dIB(t)dt=\u03b2BS(t)IB(t)+\u03b2B(VQ(t)\u2212eQVQ(0))IB(t)+\u03b2B(VT(t)\u2212eTVT(0))IB(t)\u2212\u03b3BIB(t)anddR(t)dt=\u03b3AIA(t)+\u03b3BIB(t).}",

Suppose the cost of vaccination and infection are, respectively, CV and CI. The vaccination cost includes the vaccine price with possible side effects due to vaccination. Since the infection cost is higher than the vaccination cost, we define the relative cost of vaccination as Cr = CV/CI, (0 \u2264 Cr \u2264 1). Without loss of generality, we can choose CI = 1. Then the relative cost for QIV (TIV) vaccine can be assumed as CQ(CT). Since the cost for TIV is assumed to be no more than QIV, we can presume 0 \u2264 CQ \u2264 1 and 0 \u2264 CT \u2264 CQ. Therefore, QIV(TIV) vaccinees who remain healthy during the epidemic period can have a payoff, \u2212 CQ(\u2212CT); however, QIV(TIV) vaccinees who become infected with either influenza virus (A or B) have a payoff, \u2212CQ \u2212 1(\u2212CT \u2212 1).

In a seminal work regarding the agent-based vaccination game model, Fu et al. [40] first used the pairwise Fermi function [50,51] to calculate the likelihood of copying others' strategy by comparing payoffs, where a focal agent i having the strategy Si with the payoff \u03c0i adopts the strategy Sj of a randomly chosen agent j having the payoff \u03c0j with the probability\n2.6P(Si\u2190Sj)=11+exp\u2061[\u2212(\u03c0j\u2212\u03c0i)/k],\nwhere the parameter, k > 0 measures the strength of selection; smaller k signifies the strong selection, that is players are more responsive to the payoff difference. A typical choice of k is 0.1, which has been used in many previous studies such as [16,18\u201320,29]. Fukuda et al. [18] later slightly modified the formula (2.6), where rather than comparing with a single agent, a focal player i compares its payoff \u03c0i with an average payoff \u2329\u03c0j\u232a of all neighbours having the same strategy Sj of a randomly selected neighbour j.

However, the virus with higher transmission rate is found to dominate irrespective to the initial infection. Hence, the sensitivity of initial infections seems insignificant comparing to the transmission rates, i.e. transmission rates show more impact on virus dominance.\n",

Owing to the complexity of equations (2.8) and (2.9), it is difficult to theoretically derive all possible equilibria; however, it is still possible to derive that numerically by tuning different parameters. Considering equal transmission rate for both viruses, we estimate six possible combinations of evolutionary outcomes (figure 3), which are (x, y) \u2261 (1, 0);(x, y) \u2261 (0, 0);(x, y) \u2261 (x*, y*);(x, y) \u2261 (x*, 0);(x, y) \u2261 (0, 1);(x, y) \u2261 (0, y*); where 0 < x*, y* < 1. Figure 3 suggests that there is none of the bi-stability arising from equations (2.8) and (2.9). One possible reason is that the present model as a nonlinear dynamical system instinctively has strong sinks, or steeply curved orbits, being insensible to initial conditions. Let us note that we choose initial values of x and y in such a way so that x + y \u2264 1. Moreover, when we vary initial values of x, the initial value of y is set as 0.33 and vice versa.\n",

It is worth mentioning that all heatmaps of our analyses presume the transition from the blue colour to the red colour as a good/better state to a bad/worse state of society in terms of infection, vaccination coverage and ASP, and vice versa. Clearly, infection due to influenza B virus predominates the other one that is akin to what we have observed in figure 2a,b for the case of equal transmission rates. As long as CT < CQ and CT is of lower than a certain threshold level, a broader regime in TIV heatmaps is covered by the blue colour (figure 2a-iv and b-iv); the counterpart of this region in QIV heatmaps is covered by the red colour, meaning that, because of lower cost, most individuals are interested in taking TIV vaccine until it bestows a considerable efficiency against B virus (that is of course below the efficacy of QIV vaccine). Despite a major portion taking TIV vaccine, it cannot fully suppress infection due to influenza B that can be clearly perceived from FESB heatmaps, which, in accordance, bestows a lower average payoff to society (figure 4a-v). However, the increase of effectiveness (TIV vaccine) against both viruses (if eQ = 0.8, eT = 0.6) would provide a better situation to society that can be observed from heatmaps in the second row. Remarkably, vaccination coverage for QIV vaccine seems to be dominant whenever both vaccination costs are comparable. Also, we can perceive the coexistence of both vaccinees in the borderline region between blue and red colours (yellowish regime enclosed by dotted lines in (a-iii) and (a-iv)).\n",

Obviously, similar cost for both vaccines would encourage people to choose QIV vaccine instead of TIV because the former one bestows better protection against both viruses. This situation illustrates why the sensitivity comes only along the direction of eQ (upper panels in figure 5). A lower degree of vaccine efficacy would not entice individuals to take vaccine (red region in figure 5a-iii); however, if eQ passes a threshold level, the fraction of QIV vaccinees mounts to the highest level (blue region in figure 5a-iii)). A further increase of eQ seems to suppress both infections significantly, which allows some people to avoid vaccination by free riding on herd immunity. This is why, after passing a transient regime having maximum vaccination coverage, the fraction of vaccinees decreases monotonically even with the increase of eQ (yellowish region in figure 5a-iii).\n",

As QIV vaccine provides better protection against B virus than TIV vaccine, we perceive the predominance of QIV vaccinees in case of higher \u03b2B; contrarily, TIV vaccine is favoured over QIV for higher \u03b2A because its price is lower than QIV.",

As an archetype, we choose the case illustrated in the upper panel of figure 4, where we assumed \u03b2A = \u03b2B = 0.5 and eQ = 0.6, eT = 0.4. In that case, we observed that most of the people are inclined to choose TIV vaccine whenever the cost difference between CQ and CT gets higher but individuals prefer QIV if the cost difference becomes lower. It is conceivable that the overall desired payoff or social optimum payoff for QIV vaccinees (x) would be relatively higher than the TIV vaccinees (y), which is appeared in figure 9a,b, but in this case, the vaccination coverage for QIV seems much lower than TIV (figure 4a-iii\u2013a-iv), which indicates that the dilemma of choosing QIV vaccine is higher than the other one. Obviously, this comes from the fact of higher cost associated with QIV vaccine. This factor results in less contribution of QIV vaccine to ASP (figure 4a-v). As a result, we perceive relatively higher payoff-gap between social optimum payoff for x and ASP (at equilibrium); hence, more areas of the heatmap for SEDx are seemed dark compared to its counterpart (SEDy). The whiteout region in heatmaps (figure 9c,d) depicts the scenario with no SED, that is there is no gap between social optimum payoff and ASP. There are two white regions in the SEDy-heatmap (figure 9d), which either come from 100% TIV vaccination coverage (region enclosed by blue dotted lines) resulting from lower CT and higher CQ (blue region in figure 4a-iii), or from the scenario when everyone becomes a free rider (region enclosed by red dotted lines in figure 9b,d). The latter situation can arise for higher vaccination cost or for very low vaccine effectiveness. In this case, avoiding any type of vaccination is the best strategy (desired strategy), which agrees with the D(unvaccinated)-dominant equilibrium (figure 4a-iii,a-iv). As a result, the payoff at this equilibrium also agrees with the social optimum payoff; hence no SED or no dilemma arises in this case.\n",

Here we design a mean-field vaccination game model in an infinite and well-mixed population to explain people's vaccination dilemma, entangling an epidemic spreading process of influenza with the coevolution of two types of vaccinations. Our evolutionary framework assumes three strategies\u2014choose QIV vaccine, TIV vaccine or none\u2014that evolve at the end of each season by imitating strategies based on the previous season's experience. We perform a series of numerical simulations by varying vaccination cost, vaccine effectiveness, transmission rates, etc., to depict different scenarios. Our results show that individuals are more inclined to take QIV vaccine whenever both vaccination costs are comparable; however, they prefer TIV vaccine if the cost difference gets higher.

Another interesting result concerns the variation of transmission rates for both viruses and its resulting effect on disease propagation and vaccination choice. The higher transmission rate of influenza A virus leads to a maximum coverage for TIV vaccine since it possesses the same degree of effectiveness against influenza A virus as that of QIV vaccine but with a lower cost; contrarily, the higher transmission rate of influenza B virus results in almost complete dominance of QIV vaccinees that is quite conceivable.",

It would be interesting to explore strain-specific infection, where an individual infected with a particular strain can have short-term or long-term cross-immunity against the other one (e.g. [49]). The inclusion of age structure (for instance [49,56]) in the current framework could be another aspect to explore. The influenza epidemic varies from one country to another country, thus it would be also interesting to explore the outlined framework for a specific country with proper estimation of relevant parameters [56,57]. In addition to a voluntary vaccination campaign, subsidies [14,58] provided by the government (especially for QIV vaccine) can enhance vaccination coverage to prevent disease-outbreak more efficiently. Therefore, the current framework with a subsidy provision could be another avenue to explore.",

The MAS approach presumes 10 000 agents with IA(0) = 2 agents, IB(0) = 4 agents, \u03b2A = \u03b2B = 5.19957 \u00d7 10\u22125, \u03b3A = \u03b3B = 0.2, and takes ensemble average of 100 realizations.

Similar cost encourages people (with a higher degree) to commit QIV vaccine, consequently, showing sensitivity in the direction of eQ. However, in case of different costs (CQ > CT), QIV vaccine is seen to favour over TIV vaccine when eQ \u2265 0.5 (approximately), on the other hand, TIV is favoured over QIV when eT \u2265 0.4 (approximately). The average social payoff for similar cost seems to be better than that of the different costs. Moreover, infection due to influenza A is lower than influenza B. (Online version in colour.)\n",

We can perceive the infection dominance of A and B viruses according to the conditions \u03b2A > \u03b2B and \u03b2A < \u03b2B. With the current setting, the case, \u03b2A > \u03b2B implies the total predominance of TIV vaccinees (e,f). However, if \u03b2A < \u03b2B, then QIV vaccinees prevail whenever the cost difference is not so high and both costs are below 0.6 (approximately) but the prevalence of TIV vaccinees surges with the increase of CQ and the cost difference. The region where QIV is dominant shows more impact on disease suppression comparing to that of TIV (f,g,h). (Online version in colour.)\n",
