In the current COVID-19 epidemic, it has been observed that major roads have enhanced its propagation in Italy. We propose a new simple model of propagation of epidemics which exhibits this effect and allows for a quantitative analysis. The model consists of a classical SIR model with diffusion, to which an additional compartment is added, formed by the infected individuals travelling on a line of fast diffusion. Exchanges between individuals on the line and in the rest of the domain are taken into account. A classical transformation allows us to reduce the proposed model to a system analogous to one we had previously introduced [5] to describe the enhancement of biological invasions by lines of fast diffusion. We establish the existence of a minimal spreading speed and we show that it may be quite large, even when the basic reproduction number R 0 is close to 1. More subtle qualitative features of the final state, showing the important influence of the line, are also proved here.",

In the black death epidemic of the 14th century, contagion advanced along roads connecting trade fair cities, and from there spread inwards leading to a front like invasion of Western Europe from South to North, pulled by these roads. Such a mode of propagation was also at work for the propagation of rumours (see for instance the propagation of the \"big fear\" in France, after the Revolution See, for example, the presentation given by Siegfried in [28] and the analogies between these two phenomena).

Therefore, we do not mention explicitly this function henceforth. When taking into account spatial dependence, we view the unknowns S and I as depending on both time t and space location X \u2208 R 2 .

The aim is to understand in what way such a road alters the epidemic spreading, in particular if it enhances its propagation and in what measure exactly. The starting point of our analysis consists in distinguishing the infected individuals which are moving on the line with fast diffusion from the ones present in the rest of the territory, by using two distinct density functions.

It is worth emphasizing that I(t, x, y) and T (t, x) are two different compartments, in particular T (t, x) is not the same as I(t, x, 0). Both populations are assumed to diffuse, but with different diffusion coefficients: D for T on the line and d for I in the plane. The two compartments interact by a constant exchange of individuals: at each time t > 0 and point x \u2208 R, the line yields an amount \u00b5T (t, x) of individuals to the domain, and receives an amount \u03bdI(t, x, 0) of individuals from the domain.",

Indeed, if the diffusion coefficient on the line D is larger than twice the one in the field d, the asymptotic speed of spreading in the direction of the line is enhanced, compared with the standard one c SIR . How much the spreading is enhanced is discussed in Section 6. One can then wonder what is the effect of the line on the other directions. In the case I 0 , T 0 \u2261 0, we have shown in [6] that the enhancement of the speed occurs in a cone of directions around the line, with an associated critical angle. We suspect the same scenario to hold true for system (3.5) .",

Thus, the presence of a road with fast diffusion enhances the speed of propagation of the epidemic. between the diffusion on the road and the diffusion in the field. We find that, even if R 0 is very close to 1, the diffusion on the road may trigger a wave of contamination spreading at high speed. Even though the growth of the infection at each location may be slow, the propagation along the road may be fast. 4 . We compare the total cumulative number of infected individuals per location, I tot (x), in the cases with and without the road. We show that, compared with the standard SIR model, the I tot (x) in the presence of the road is larger in the range of x large, that is, far from the epicentre of the epidemic. This result is not intuitive a priori. Indeed, from the enhancement of the speed of spreading of the epidemic wave by the road, it also follows that at any location the epidemic peak lasts less than without this enhancement. Therefore, one might have thought that, moving faster, the total number of infected by the epidemic would go down. However, far from the epicenter, the contrary happens. We also prove that while the total number of infected is higher far away, there is also a region E \u2212 , presumably close to the epicenter, where the total number of infected I tot (x) for the model with the road is smaller than the corresponding one for the standard SIR model. It would be interesting to characterise such a set E \u2212 in some specific cases, establishing for instance whether it actually contains the epicentre of the epidemic.
