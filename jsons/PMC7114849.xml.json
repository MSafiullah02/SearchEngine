In order to achieve these goals, different technical approaches have been adopted worldwide. In the USA, three high level isolation units (HLIUs) are available. In general, these units are clinical facilities specifically designed to minimise the risk of nosocomial spread of HIDs, adopting engineering and safety measures usually used in biosafety level (BSL) 3 and 4 containment laboratories, that include negative air pressure ventilation for entire units, restricted access, special treatment of waste and other infrastructure and administrative controls not typically found in routine clinical settings. In the USA these units are usually constructed in connection with BSL 3\u20134 laboratories, in order to deal also with potential laboratory-acquired infections due to accidental exposure.4, 5 During the SARS epidemic, some countries that experienced local transmission managed the need for isolation by the creation of temporary isolation wards.6 In Europe, different approaches exist. In some countries, HLIUs are available, or are in construction. In the UK, \u2018Trexler Units\u2019, a particular type of negative-pressure plastic isolator containing one or two beds, are in use.7 In other countries, healthcare facilities specifically developed for the management of HIDs do not exist, and these patients are managed in negative-pressure isolation rooms.",

We adopted this definition because it accords with international guidelines, and we believed that these features are crucial for effective patient isolation and may represent the minimum requirements for such facilities.4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Negative pressure is essential for the isolation of patients affected by confirmed or suspected diseases with obligate, preferential or opportunistic airborne transmission (XDR-TB, SARS, human-adapted highly pathogenic strains of influenza virus, smallpox). The presence of an anteroom increases the efficiency of the system, providing an obstacle against pressure loss and reducing the risk of movement of contaminated air into common areas; moreover the anteroom provides a controlled environment in which donning and removal of personal protective equipment and other infection control procedures can be done safely.",
