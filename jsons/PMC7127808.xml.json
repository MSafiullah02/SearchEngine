Accordingly, APN is a major target for treatment of diseases related to these physiological processes [1]. APN is the most extensively studied member of the M1-family of zinc-dependent aminopeptidases [1]. This enzyme is widely expressed on cell surfaces of tissues, such as intestinal epithelia and the nervous system [1]. APN is a type II membrane protein generally found as a homodimer in several mammalian species. Full-length human APN consists of 967 amino acids with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane segment, and a large ectodomain containing two catalytic motifs highly conserved across the M1 family: the zinc-binding motif HEXXHX18E and the exopeptidase signature GXMEN [2].",

            "text": "The general catalytic mechanism of mammalian APN is believed to be similar to that of prototypic zinc peptidase thermolysin, which involves catalytic water attacking scissile peptide bonds [3]. However, the means by which substrates gain access to the catalytic site and how products are released have been the subject of some debate for several members of the M1 family [4], [5], [6]. APN preferentially cleaves neutral amino acids, most notably alanine, off the N terminus of peptide substrates leading to their activation/inactivation in the extracellular space. Mammalian APN operates ubiquitously in peptide metabolism pathways. It plays important roles in pain sensation and mood regulation by catalyzing the metabolism of neuropeptides that process sensory information. One of these neuropeptides is enkephalin, which binds to opioid receptors and has pain-relief and mood-regulating effects [7]; APN hydrolyses and shortens the in vivo life of enkephalin. APN is moreover involved in blood pressure regulation; it degrades the vasoconstrictive peptide angiotensin-III, causing vasodilation and lowered blood pressure [8]. An endogenous APN inhibitor, substance P, blocks both the enkephalin-dependent and angiotensin-dependent pathways [9], [10]. APN is also overexpressed on the cell surface of almost all major cancer forms and is essential for tumor angiogenesis by degrading angiogenic peptides [11]. A natural APN inhibitor, bestatin, is a substrate analog for APN and demonstrates antitumor activities [12]. However, it should be noted that these generic inhibitors often show activity against other aminopeptidase families [13].",

In this study, we identified three non-competitive inhibitors of the human and porcine APN by combining virtual screening and enzymatic assays. These non-peptide inhibitors lack the typical zinc-binding groups (ZBG) present in most of the APN inhibitors. Molecular docking simulations suggested these compounds hindered APN activity by an alternative mechanism to Zn coordination. Notably, the intraperitoneal injection of compounds BTB07018 and JFD00064 inhibited APN activity in rat brain, liver and kidney indicating a good bio-distribution.",

To determine the strength and type of inhibition of the compounds against porcine aminopeptidase activity, the Michaelis-Menten model and the Lineweaver-Burk approximation were used (Fig. 2\nA\u2013D, A\u2032-D\u2032, respectively). The details of the fitting to both mathematic models are shown in Supplementary Information Table 3. The pattern of straight lines in the double-reciprocal plots represented the signature for a typical non-competitive inhibition profile for all the inhibitors [26], [27]; this implies that the inhibitors display binding affinity for both the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate binary complex, and suggests that they do not compete with the substrate for binding to the free enzyme. Remarkably, the lines intersect above the x and y axes, at negatives values of 1/[S] and positive values of 1/v, indicating that all the inhibitors decrease the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate (signature \u03b1 > 1) (Fig. 2 A\u2032-D\u2032) [26], [27]. This mode of inhibition is also referred to as mixed inhibition, based on the effect of increasing inhibitor concentration on both Vmax and KM values. Similar inhibition profiles were obtained for the interaction of the compounds with the hAPN (data not shown). The secondary plots used for Ki and \u03b1Ki determination are shown in Supplementary Information Fig. 4.

In this study, we identified APN inhibitors which chemical structures did not contain the classical ZBG. To figure out how these molecules inhibit human and porcine neutral aminopeptidases, we analyzed the binding mode of the inhibitors to the human APN obtained by molecular docking simulations. We observed a remarkable prevalence of hydrophobic interactions with aliphatic (Ala-351 and Ala-353), aromatic (Phe-472, Tyr-891, and Phe-896) and polar (Gln-211 and Gln-213) residues (Fig. 3\n). The compounds did not coordinate the zinc ion in the active site, and established few hydrophobic interactions with the metal coordinating residues His388, His392, and Glu411 (Fig. 3). We predicted that all the inhibitors bind to Tyr477, a residue involved in the stabilization of the transition state oxyanion form, through hydrophobic interactions, and that compounds BTB11079 and BTB07018 establish hydrophobic interactions with Glu389, a key residue for polarizing the water molecule that attacks the scissile peptide bond. Contrary to bestatin [2], we predicted interactions of the identified inhibitors with residues: Ser-415, Glu-418, Tyr-419, Asn-438, Asp-439 Arg-442, Asp-473, Ala-474, Asn-900, and Gln-903 (Fig. 3).

Therefore, we docked the substrate in the active site of hAPN and subsequently we aligned the 3D structure of the APN:substrate complex over the APN:inhibitor complexes to generate ternary APN-inhibitor-substrate complexes (Fig. 3). Remarkably, we predicted that none of the compounds interacted with all the residues belonging to the substrate binding site, leaving unoccupied spaces that allow inhibitor and substrate binding to the enzyme at the same time (Fig. 3). The analysis of the 3D structure of the enzyme-inhibitor-substrate complexes revealed that inhibitor-enzyme interactions span residues comprised among the S1 and S5\u2032 subsites, while the substrate interacts only with the S1 subsite (Fig. 3). The differences between the enzyme binding mode of the new inhibitors and of the substrate explained the non-competitive inhibition profile. Thus, we predicted that compound BTB07018 established interactions with residues: Ala-351, Glu-418, Arg-442, Asp-473, Ala-474, Phe-896 and Asn-900, which were not shared by the substrate.",

However, the pattern of straight lines in the double-reciprocal plots, obtained as a result of a preliminary study at a fixed concentration of each inhibitor and increasing concentration of the substrate L-Glu-pNA, indicated the signature for a competitive mode of inhibition (Supplementary Information Fig. 5). The analysis of the sequence of other aminopeptidases of the M1 family suggests that targeting residues: Ala-351, Arg-442, Ala-474, Phe-896 and Asn-900 should improve the selectivity of neutral aminopeptidase inhibitors (Fig. 3).",

            "text": "Aminopeptidase N is a transmembrane protease present in a wide variety of human tissues and cell types (endothelial, epithelial, fibroblast, leukocyte). APN expression is dysregulated in inflammatory diseases as well as in solid and hematologic tumors [12]. Therefore, inhibitors of APN may be effective against cancer and inflammation [12], [31], [32]. Chelating zinc ions through a ZBG is the most common mode of action of neutral aminopeptidase inhibitors [13], [28], [29], [30], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38]. Most of these inhibitors display a competitive inhibition mode of action. Here, we identified three non-competitive inhibitors (\u03b1 > 1) of human and porcine neutral aminopeptidases; these ligands do not contain a ZBG in their 3D structure. The Ki values of these new compounds were similar to those reported for natural APN inhibitors [12], [29]. Molecular docking simulations predicted that the inhibitors bind to a site distinct from that occupied by the substrate in the human APN active site (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the non-competitive inhibition profile obtained in the kinetic assays. The analysis of hAPN:Inhibitor complexes showed that interactions span from S1 to S5\u2032 sub-sites, without Zn ion coordination. This uncommon mechanism of inhibition is similar to that described for compound MMV666023, an inhibitor of the neutral M1 aminopeptidase of Plasmodium falciparum\n[39]. The newly identified inhibitors share with compound MMV666023 a high hydrophobicity and a lack of typical ZBG [39]. The lack of ZBG may diminish inhibitor interactions with other metalloenzymes, and may improve pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability of APN inhibitors [39]. Additional experiments, including site-directed mutagenesis and crystallography studies, are needed to confirm the binding mode of the hAPN:Inhibitor complexes.",

            "text": "To check the selectivity of the inhibitor we tested its activity over porcine APA. APN and APA form the same interactions with the main chain of the N-terminal residue (P1 residue) of their ligands, suggesting that the two enzymes share a common catalytic mechanism despite their modest sequence similarity [2], [40]. However, the S1 pocket that accommodates the P1 side chain of ligands differs markedly between APN and APA, consistent with the different substrate specificities of the two enzymes. Residues Phe-896 and Ala-351 of the S1 pocket of APN favor the accommodation of bulky hydrophobic side chains [2]. Conversely, the S1 pocket of APA is well suited to accommodate the side chains of acidic residues; the carboxylate side chain of bound glutamate forms a strong salt bridge with Arg-887 and a hydrogen bond with Thr-356. These energetically favorable interactions are consistent with high APA activity on substrates with a P1 glutamate [40]. Therefore, we did not expect selectivity of the identified inhibitors for APN over APA because we predicted these ligands target several conserved residues. Preliminary kinetics experiments confirmed that the new compounds also inhibited pAPA with IC50 values similar to those detected for pAPN. However, BTB11079, JFD00064, and BTB07018 displayed a competitive inhibition mode that differed from that vs pAPN. This may result from an accommodation of the inhibitors at the active site of pAPA that differs from the binding mode predicted for APN. Additional experiments should clarify the selectivity of the newly identified inhibitors against other aminopeptidases of the M1 family, and may identify dual inhibitions of biomedical relevance [13]. Based on the sequence and structural analyses, we predicted that targeting the APN residues Ala-351, Arg-442, Ala-474, Phe-896 and Asn-900 might be useful for improving the selectivity of the identified inhibitors.",

This finding is relevant due to the implication of APN in physio- and patho-physiological processes in these tissues [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46]. Many hydrophobic drugs reversibly bind to Site 1 of human serum albumin (HSA), an association that improves the pharmacokinetics properties of therapeutic compounds [47]. Since mammalian serum albumins share more than 70% of sequence identity and have similar functions [48], the effective delivery of JFD00064 and BTB07018 to rat tissues may have been facilitated by their reversible binding to rat serum albumin hydrophobic sites. Moreover, HSA delivery systems have been extensively studied for treating brain disease since HSA can pass through the blood brain barrier [48]; interestingly, compounds JFD00064 and BTB07018 inhibited APN activity in the brain of rats, indicating these molecules crossed the blood-brain barrier. Further experiments are needed to confirm the interaction of these ligands with serum albumin.",

Molecular docking simulations suggest these novel inhibitors block APN activity by an alternative mechanism to Zn coordination. Of note, these compounds also inhibited the porcine aminopeptidase A (pAPA) by a competitive inhibition mode. This indicated differences in the binding mode of these compounds with APN and APA. Based on sequence and structural analyses we predict that targeting human APN residues: A351, R442, A474, F896 and N900 may lead to the design of more selective APN inhibitors. Remarkably, compounds BTB07018 and JFD00064 inhibited APN activity in the brain, liver and kidney of rats indicating a good bio-distribution in vivo. Compound BTB07018 seemed to be the most promising lead among the identified inhibitors due to its cLogP <4. This work reinforces the recent idea of designing novel APN inhibitors based on lead compounds without ZBG.",
