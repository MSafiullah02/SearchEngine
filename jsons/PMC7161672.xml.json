Over the next few months SARS rapidly spread throughout\nChina, leap-frogged to Hong Kong, and from there spread by global air to every continent\nand 29 countries. Along the way SARS infected more than 8,000 people and took at least\n774 lives. One out of every two older persons who contracted the disease died.\nAdditionally, it snarled global air traffic, cost billions of dollars, heightened\npolitical tensions, and brought home the message that cities in the global network are\ncontinually at risk for a serious microbe invasion riding along with the daily\ninternational exchanges of travelers, products, plants, and animals.",

Plagues typically\noverrun the normal capacity of community healthcare systems to respond, and without help\nfrom external expert systems such as the World Health Organization (WHO), local\ncommunities can suffer excessive casualties (Schwirian, 2005). The timely arrival of help from external agencies and\norganizations is not automatically assured because responses to outbreaks of plague\noften become tangled in the morass of national and international politics (Fidler, 2004). The WHO has taken on the role of\nbeing the chief agency that provides worldwide assistance to countries and communities\nas they battle overwhelming health crises.

In major events such as a breakout of plague, the finger pointing begins\nearly, proceeds for a long time, and may have serious consequences for those\nultimately \u201cblamed.\u201d Blame is socially constructed and politicized (Cohen, 1997; Schwirian, Curry, & Woldoff, 2001; Schwirian, 2006). Responsibility for failure may be assigned to a person,\ngroup, outside agent, entity, event, or chance. Assigning blame defines the target for\nnegative sanctions. In assigning blame, more powerful actors work to assign it to the\nleast powerful; system insiders tend to assign blame to system outsiders. The ability\nto assign blame is a powerful tool in political and administrative matters at all\nlevels.",
