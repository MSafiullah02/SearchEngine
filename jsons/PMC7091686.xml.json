However, many pathogens can exist in asymptomatic carriage states or are infectious before clinical disease symptoms appear.

The simplest method of sterilisation involves the use of steam under pressure, for example at a temperature of 121 \u00b0C for 15-30 minutes, or at 134 \u00b0C for 3-4 minutes in an autoclave. It is necessary to clean all devices thoroughly before autoclaving since particles of dirt can protect microorganisms from the autoclave cycle. To ensure that the steriliser is functioning correctly, automatic control tests must be performed daily and records should be retained in a logbook for at least 2 years. Chemical process indicators, such as autoclave tape, sterilisation packaging or bags containing an indicator are useful to identify items that have been sterilised, but cannot be used to validate the autoclave cycle. Steam sterilisation is not appropriate for all equipment and chemical sterilisation with ethylene oxide gas, formaldehyde gas, hydrogen peroxide gas, liquid peracetic acid or ozone can be used as an alternative. Validated chemical sterilisation methods are not usually available in dental surgeries and are most easily obtained through a specialist contractor. Single use devices provide a simple alternative to sterilisation of sensitive equipment and are indicated by a clear logo, as shown in Figure 3.",

Since the introduction of such measures in both the US and the UK, rates of BBV infection among healthcare workers have decreased to the point where they are no higher than the general population.8 Nevertheless, there continue to be occasional reports of transmission of BBVs between patients and dental professionals.",

The incidence of chronic HBV is increasing in the UK as a result of immigration from parts of the world where HBV prevalence is much higher. Infection with HBV involves an acute phase, lasting around 75 days, in which symptoms including fever, nausea, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain and jaundice often appear. The likelihood that acute infection will progress to chronic or carriage state varies from around 90% of neonates, 25% of children or 5% of adults that acquire HBV. Fortunately, there is an effective vaccine against HBV, which gives approximately 95% protection, and all healthcare professionals should receive this vaccine.",

Extra-pulmonary TB occurs most commonly in HIV patients and can affect the lymph nodes, bones and joints, the gastrointestinal tract, the genitourinary tract or the central nervous system.

Strains of MRSA are resistant to multiple antibiotics and some S. aureus infections are now very difficult to treat. For many years, hospital acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) has been the major threat in the UK. However, more recently community acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) has emerged as a significant problem in the US and it is possible that this will also take hold in the UK. Whereas HA-MRSA tends to affect elderly or immunocompromised patients in healthcare settings, CA-MRSA often occurs in young, otherwise healthy individuals. S. aureus is primarily transmitted through contact and causes a wide range of different infections ranging from superficial lesions to deep-seated infections such as septic arthritis, endocarditis or pneumonia. Toxins produced by S. aureus can cause food poisoning or toxic shock syndrome. In the mouth, S. aureus may be responsible for angular cheilitis, parotitis, osteomyelitis or mucositis. Standard cross infection control measures should restrict the spread of MRSA and hand hygiene is particularly important.",

An epidemic of prion disease in cattle, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE, or mad cow disease) occurred in the UK between 1985-1996 and resulted in the slaughter of 4.4 million cows. Subsequently, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) was identified in humans and has caused 176 deaths up to the end of 2012. Prion diseases are extremely rare, but the infectious agent is highly resistant to standard disinfection and sterilisation protocols, even including steam sterilisation. Harsh chemical treatments such as 1-2 M sodium hydroxide for one hour at room temperature or immersion in greater than 20,000 ppm sodium hypochlorite for one hour at room temperature may inactivate prions, as will extended steam sterilisation, for example 121 \u00b0C for 1 hour, or 134 \u00b0C for 18 minutes. However, these procedures may not be compatible with manufacturers' recommendations for devices and are likely to be most appropriate for known or suspected cases of prion disease. Alternatively, single use devices are a good option if there is a significant risk of prion transmission.",
