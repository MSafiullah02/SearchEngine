Intramuscular betamethasone 12 mg once daily for 2 doses was also given due to the potential need for preterm delivery. COVID-19 laboratory values (Table 1) were drawn and were significant for elevated aspartate aminotransferase at 62 IU/L, total creatine phosphokinase at 531 IU/L, c-reactive protein at 14.7 mg/dL and decreased absolute lymphocytes at 0.13 K/uL (0.13 mm3). Upon arrival at the intensive care unit she was intubated for increased work of breathing and profound hypoxia with a partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 75.6 mmHg on arterial blood gas. Her initial ventilator settings (Table 2) were the following: tidal volume at 400 mL, respiratory rate at 16 breaths/min, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cm H2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 100%. A discussion with the patient's durable power of attorney designee was completed regarding indications for delivery and potential need for emergency cesarean delivery based on both maternal and fetal status. A decision was made to conduct fetal heart rate monitoring 3 times daily for 20 min to assess fetal status and allow for delivery in case of significant fetal compromise. The patient had central and arterial lines inserted; of note, the arterial line required replacement multiple times due to thrombosis despite venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously daily. The patient completed her full course of hydroxychloroquine and prednisone. Her maximum PEEP was 12 cm H2O while ventilated. After 7 days of intubation, the patient was able to be weaned to a PEEP of 5 cm H2O and a FiO2 of 50% and was successfully extubated. She was placed on a high-flow nasal cannula at 30 L, which was weaned down to 6 L. She was transferred to labor and delivery on hospital day 10 for de-escalation of care. She was weaned down to nasal cannula at 2 L on hospital day 10 and on hospital day 11 patient was on room air. Her oxygen saturation at rest was 96%\u201398% and with ambulation 92%\u201393%.

A quarter of women diagnosed with pneumonia in pregnancy require hospitalization, often critical care, and many need ventilatory support [4]. While the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome in pregnancy generally mirrors that in the non-pregnant population, it remains unclear if COVD-19 pneumonia in pregnancy has a single characteristic clinical course or is more variable. Some recent authors have proposed different clinical \u2018phenotypes\u2019 of COVID-19 pneumonia depending on infection severity, ventilatory responsiveness, and time elapsed from onset of disease. These authors posit an initial \u2018Type L' presentation (low elastance, ventilation to perfusion ratio, lung weight, and lung recruitability) followed by \u2018Type H' (high elastance, right-to-left shunt, lung weight, and lung recruitability) [5]. Optimal intensive care interventions and ventilatory support settings require an appreciation of the potential variable clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in pregnancy.",
