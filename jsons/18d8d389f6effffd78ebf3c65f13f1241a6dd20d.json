            "text": "The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa raised many questions about the control of infectious disease in an increasingly connected global society. Limited availability of contact information made contact tracing difficult or impractical in combating the outbreak. We consider the development of multi-scale public health strategies and simulate policies for community-level response aimed at early screening of communities rather than individuals, as well as travel restriction to prevent community cross-contamination. Our analysis shows the policies to be effective even at a relatively low level of compliance. In our simulations, 40% of individuals conforming to these policies is enough to stop the outbreak. Simulations with a 50% compliance rate are consistent with the case counts in Liberia during the period of rapid decline after mid September, 2014. We also find the travel restriction to be effective at reducing the risks associated with compliance substantially below the 40% level, shortening the outbreak and enabling efforts to be focused on affected areas. Our results suggest that the multi-scale approach can be used to further evolve public health strategy for defeating emerging epidemics.",

            "text": "The initial medical response to Ebola in 2014 focused on caring for individuals in hospital settings and using contact tracing as the primary preventative measure [1] . Contact tracing is the accepted method for public health control of infectious diseases [2] and has been the subject of theoretical and empirical studies [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Under contact tracing, a patient admitted to a hospital is asked about their recent direct contacts, and those contacts are monitored or isolated for the incubation period of the disease [2, 14] . The spread of Ebola to dense urban communities made it difficult or impossible for contact tracing to work due to the large number of responders needed to trace contacts when many people are infected. While some contacts were knowable like family and friends, including those from ritual washing of the dead, others were untraceable anonymous interactions in public markets, buses, and taxis [15] [16] [17] [18] . For traceable interactions, the number of individuals that are needed to perform contact tracing activities (interviewing, compiling lists, seeking out contacted individuals, performing monitoring and isolation of identified individuals) grows with the number of infected cases. For an exponentially growing number of cases, the number of responders for an effective response must grow exponentially, and without this level of response, the number of cases cannot be curtailed [1, 19, 20] . As an alternate approach, we consider community-based monitoring and limiting travel to reduce inter-community contagion [21] .",

Such approaches were taken in Liberia beginning in mid September 2014 [22, 23] and in Sierra Leone beginning in mid December 2014 [24] , and may be responsible for the rapid reduction in cases seen in those two countries. In particular, in early March 2015, it was announced that there were zero remaining active cases of Ebola in Liberia [25] . Subsequent intermittent cases have not led to the same level of crisis. While the Centers for Disease Control Director Tom Frieden attributed much of the success in the public health effort to the formation of local teams based upon the principle of RITE (Rapid Isolation and Treatment of Ebola) [26] , the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported community engagement as a key factor in the successful response [18] .",

This is due to the extended infectious period and tendency of the disease to become more contagious as it progresses [27] [28] [29] . Contact tracing addresses this, but it is highly dependent on the patient knowing the people they interact with, made nearly impossible in urban environments with anonymous interactions. Here we explore a multi-scale intervention based on these ideas. Instead of monitoring individuals from a list of contacts, a community-based strategy requires that entire communities be monitored for new cases until infection is ruled out. Symptomatic individuals are isolated and treated to prevent further infections. This community-based early detection is augmented by restricting long-distance travel or subjecting travelers to extended periods of limited contact and observation. Restricting travel inhibits cross-contamination between communities and allows more targeted care to be given to infected communities. The objective is to progressively limit the disease to smaller and smaller areas and to focus resources on the areas in which the disease is present. In contrast to contact tracing, the number of responders needed for community monitoring grows only with the number of infected areas instead of the number of cases. Moreover, the effort needed to train individuals to screen for fever, the primary activity, is low, and those performing community monitoring can be members of that community.",

However, an analysis must account for how effective the implementation of screening will be. It is infeasible and undesirable to constrain the population using high levels of force, so the level of compliance that is achieved is a key variable in efficacy. Here we model compliance as a probability that individuals will adhere to the community-level policies. This captures both the possibility of defiance as well as other sources of performance failure such as accidents or lack of awareness or information. We analyze the level of compliance necessary for the policies to work effectively. As shown in Fig. 1 , we find that even with 40% compliance the community level policies curtail the epidemic and a 60% compliance rapidly ends the outbreak. Screening begins at the vertical dotted line, with a level of compliance indicated by label and color (green 0 to blue 1.0). A. Number of cases with or without symptoms. Note that even 40% compliance (0.4) results in decrease in cases. B. Cumulative cases. C. R t , the effective reproductive number-the average number of individuals infected by an index case at time t. For an epidemic to continue to grow, R t must exceed 1. For 40% compliance (0.4) and greater, R t decreases below one, corresponding with a decrease in active cases. R t drops before t = 70 because policies affect the contagion of individuals that are initially infected prior to the intervention.",

Newly infected individuals progress through a latent period for \u2206 days where they are asymptomatic and not contagious. They then become contagious for a period of \u0393 days, at the end of which they have either died or have recovered and have acquired immunity from further reinfection.

Results using these parameter values are in the Supplement. The impact of intervention policies can be readily seen by plotting the effective reproduction number R t , the average number of secondary infections caused by a primary case who is first infected at time t [54] . An R t greater than 1 at a given time implies that the epidemic will grow exponentially over the short term, while less than one implies it will decline exponentially. Unlike R 0 , R t is designed to reflect the effect of interventions as well as that of natural epidemic burnout. Plotted in Fig. 1C , we see that compliance levels of 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 cause the value of R t to decrease well below the threshold value 1.0 within a span of several days. This represents a quick transition from a regime in which the disease is growing exponentially to a regime in which the epidemic can no longer sustain itself and consequently dies out. Even with a compliance of 0.4, enough infections were halted to reduce the value of R t below 1 (Fig. 1C) .",

Since the results of the simulation are robust to variation in parameters, the correspondence of the real world data in with the simulation reflects the reduction of R t below the epidemic threshold Liberia. for which the contact structure itself changes to a small world network model (Kleinberg network). For the Moore neighborhood network, each individual is connected to its closest eight rather than four nearest neighbors. The Kleinberg network was implemented by allowing individuals to have a varying number of long-range contacts with their probability of making that connection decrease with distance. We also allowed the length of the of latent and infectious periods to vary for individuals across values found by Chowell [56] to allow for variable stage lengths. Fig. 6 shows the results of the simulations with these different networks, with \u03c4 and \u03b7 adjusted so that each network's growth rate has an R 0 in agreement with the observed results for Ebola. The results show the intervention effectiveness remains high and a compliance above 50% is sufficient to rapidly stop the epidemic. This provides additional evidence for the relevance of the results to real world conditions despite approximations used in modeling the transmission network.

The time until the start of the intervention is important in measuring the impact of early response on the control of an emerging outbreak. We assume that, even after the start of the intervention, individuals cannot be isolated and are fully capable of infecting others on the first day of their infectious period.

The lack of compliance, occurring with probability 1 \u2212 \u03ba, is assumed to be complete in the sense that noncompliant individuals continue to infect others for the duration of their infectious period.The travel restrictions are implemented based on cordons outlined in the policy draft[21].

IV. RESULTSFig. 1 shows the number of current and cumulative cases for various levels of compliance with community level interventions implemented at T 0 = 70 days and without travelrestrictions. We found that a relatively low compliance of 0.4 with the community screening policies was enough to end the outbreak(Fig. 1A).Fig. 1Bshows that there is relatively little difference in the cumulative number of infections over the duration of the outbreak for the interventions with 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 compliance. Thus, and perhaps surprisingly, the greatest gains in reducing the epidemic duration and cumulative number of cases arise from a particularly low level of compliance.",

The cumulative number of infections over the entire epidemic, as a function of compliance levels and intervention times. Colors from brown to yellow signify intervention times(50, 70, 90, 110). Without enforced travel restrictions (dotted lines), a low compliance results in little differentiation between early and late policy implementation. The travel restrictions (solid lines) dramatically reduce infection number for earlier interventions at low compliance.V. ROBUSTNESS ANALYSISThe compliance analysis presented above is a robustness analysis of the community based response strategy. Additionally, we tested the robustness of our analysis to the approximations used to model the network of transmission. This also tests the robustness of the intervention policies to changes in the societal transmission network.
