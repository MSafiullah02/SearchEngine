            "text": "Background: Studies on the etiology of respiratory infections among children in Qatar and surrounding countries are limited. Objectives: To describe the prevalence and seasonality of RSV, influenza, and other respiratory pathogens among children in Qatar. Methods: We retrospectively collected and analyzed data of 33,404 children (<15 years) presented with influenza-like illness from 2012 to 2017. Results: At least one respiratory pathogen was detected in 26,138 (78%) of patients. Together, human rhinoviruses (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza viruses comprised nearly two-thirds of all cases, affecting 24%, 19.7%, and 18.5%, respectively. A prevalence of 5-10% was recorded for adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human bocavirus (HboV), and human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), enteroviruses, M. pneumonia, and parechovirus had prevalences below 5%. While RSV, influenza, and HMPV exhibited strong seasonal activity in the winter, HRV was active during low RSV and influenza circulation. The burden of RSV exceeds that of influenza among young age groups, whereas influenza correlated positively with age. Further, HRV, adenovirus, influenza, and RSV infection rates varied significantly between male and females. Conclusion: This comprehensive multi-year study provides insights into the etiology of ILI among children in Qatar, which represents the Gulf region. Our results reinforce the significance of active surveillance of respiratory pathogens to improve infection prevention and control strategies, particularly among children.",

Many pathogens have been reported to cause respiratory infections; however, viruses are considered the main cause, accounting for 40%-50% of infections in hospitalized children in developing countries (Simoes et al., 2006; Comach et al., 2012; Tregoning and Schwarze, 2010) . The most commonly reported virus is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Al-Romaihi et al., 2019; Krilov, 2001) . Other common viruses include influenza A (IAV) and B viruses (IBV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenovirus, and human rhinovirus (HRV) (Monto, 2002; Williams et al., 2002; Pavia, 2011) . Additionally, several new viruses have been also found to manifest clinically as influenza-like illnesses (ILIs), including human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoVs), and human bocavirus (HboV) (Pavia, 2011; Debiaggi et al., 2012; Walker et al., 2013) .

The difference in infection rates could be reflecting the true burden in each region, or it is possibly attributed to differences in the studied population, diagnostic methods, and environmental factors. Of note, the positivity rate among children with ILI exceeds that of ILI in adults considerably, as reported by our group and others (Otomaru et al., 2015; Puzelli et al., 2009; Laguna-Torres et al., 2009; Arango et al., 2015; Ren et al., 2009) .",

We also found that RSV and HMPV circulate simultaneously with influenza while HRV was primarily active during low RSV and influenza activity, which is similar to previous reports (Njouom et al., 2012; Haynes et al., 2016; Razanajatovo et al., 2011; Nguyen et al., 2016) . While many studies failed to determine HRV seasonality (Taylor et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2016) , our data indicated a noticeable seasonal activity during early fall at the time of school opening in Qatar, followed by another peak around March. Likewise, infections with adenovirus and M. pneumonia tend to raise at the time of low RSV and influenza circulation. Adenovirus usually does not exhibit a discernible seasonal circulation pattern; however, similar to our results, the increase in virus transmission around May has been previously reported (G\u00fclen et al., 2014) . We also found that HboV displayed a consistent increase during late winter/early spring in most of the years, in line with reports from Iran and South Africa (Tabasi et al., 2016; Schildgen et al., 2008) . We also found that the overall seasonality of PIVs was ambiguous and lacked any specific circulation trends. However, late fall and early winter exhibited higher PIVs cases, especially with PIV type 3 and 4. Contrarily, according to the CDC, PIV-1 and PIV-2 circulate more commonly during fall, PIV-3 occur frequently in spring and summer, while PIV-4 circulate without any seasonal occurrence (Human Parainfluenza Viruses, 2017). On the other hand, HCoVs were more prevalent in winter, typical of other respiratory viruses. Yet, positive cases were also reported during warm months confirming other reports (Soonnarong et al., 2016; Gaunt et al., 2010) . Finally, parechovirus infections were scattered throughout the years, with no temporal patterns, although previous records indicated higher activity between fall and winter (Chiang et al., 2017) . This is probably due to the low infection rates reported in our study. In fact, the variation in the reported viruses' seasonality could possible result from the sampling bias that exists in most retrospective studies, in which more specimens are usually collected during the winter months.",

Given the large number of enrolled patients, this is the largest scale report on ILIs among children in the MENA region to the best of our knowledge. Information obtained from this study shall have important implications on infections' control and prevention policies, particularly for public health authorities and health systems. For instance, results would help in launching prevention and control programs such as vaccine campaigns according to the country-specific pathogens' seasonality. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these vaccine and awareness campaigns could be improved by prioritizing high-risk groups with higher infection burden. This epidemiologic study can also improve the diagnosis strategy by providing data about the causes of ILIs in the country, and hence, help in improving the selection of pathogens for regular clinical testing. Nonetheless, future studies that include patients' vaccination records and clinical symptoms are still needed to understand the clinical significance and the vaccine coverage of respiratory diseases in Qatari population.",
