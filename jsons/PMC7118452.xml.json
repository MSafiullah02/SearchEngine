The latest influenza pandemic event started with the detection of a rapidly circulating new influenza strain called the human swine influenza (HSI) (WHO, 2010). The high frequency and intensity of procedures that involve close physical patient contact present occupational hazards for emergency nurses (Tam et al., 2007). In addition, uncertainties about patients\u2019 infectious condition are extremely alarming for emergency nurses providing nursing care (Ovens et al., 2003). However, available studies about nurses\u2019 pandemic experiences during the HSI pandemic are limited, lacking in both quantitative and qualitative research (Corley et al., 2010). This study gathered insight from emergency nurses in Hong Kong (HK) regarding their experience and perceptions toward work during HSI outbreak. The results of this study will contribute to developing preparedness at healthcare institutions in response to future pandemics.",

The findings of this study also provide information that self-quarantine is one strategy that participants employ to minimize the transmission hazard to their family. Self-quarantine is deemed effective in limiting the spread of pathogens (Rao et al., 2009). However, because of the generally congested living environment in HK, household isolation measures could be unintentionally violated, thus influencing the efficacy of protecting family members against germs (Huang, 2009).

In a study in Australia, PPE usage was reported to be annoying for frontline staff and created unnecessary duties during the HSI pandemic (Corley et al., 2010). The perception of discomfort and inconvenience of PPE might affect the compliance of healthcare professionals in using PPE. The refusal to adhere to PPE utilization use could pose a threat to public health (Loeb et al., 2004). Administrators should persuade frontline healthcare workers to use PPE properly by describing the proven effectiveness of PPE in preventing contamination.",

As was shown in previous studies, healthcare professionals were willing to work despite the potential risk of infection due to their professional obligations (Corley et al., 2010, Leiba et al., 2006, Wong et al., 2008). In addition to retaining efficient manpower, a sense of strong professional commitment contributes to an improved quality of nursing care regarding the level of overall patient safety (Teng et al., 2009). Controversially, there were evidences suggested that threat of diseases could predominate professional obligations of the healthcare professionals. From Wong et al. (2010) study, it was revealed that a large proportion of community nurses (as high as 70%) would be unwilling to work in the pandemic period of HSI. More than a tenth of the healthcare manpower was also estimated to decrease in an epidemic event because of absenteeism among healthcare professionals (Tam et al., 2007). Reasons behind the huge difference in healthcare professionals\u2019 preferences over willingness to work addressed the need for further in-depth studies on this aspect.",

Poor morale among staff in the emergency department has been anticipated in the literature (Robinson et al., 2009). Although the participating nurses described their motivation at work as being satisfactorily sustained during the pandemic, a study in the United Kingdom indicated that the morale among healthcare professionals was undermined because of a paucity of recognition from their employer (Ives et al., 2009).",
