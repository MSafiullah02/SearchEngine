Unaware of Schneider's success,Oldfield Thomas (1910) later wrote that \u2018if an Arctonyx occurs in the \u2026 mountain districts [of Sumatra], and its characteristics are in any way compatible with Hubrecht's animal, after elimination of the imaginary Edentate attributes, the name hoevenii may have to be used for it.\u2019 In their report on an expedition to Mt Kerinci in west Sumatra, Robinson & Kloss (1918) redescribed the Sumatran hog-badger on the basis of newly collected series of skins and skulls deposited at the Raffles Museum in Singapore. In keeping with Thomas' recommendation, they designated a specimen in the Federated Malay States Museum (now the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research) as a neotype for hoevenii to anchor the name's association with the Arctonyx of Sumatra, because Hubrecht had, rather memorably, been unable to secure a type for the original description. Although they used the name Arctonyx collaris hoeveni in the text of their paper, Robinson and Kloss also figured a plate of the species bearing the name \u2018Arctonyx hoeveni\u2019, perhaps betraying their uncertainty regarding the Sumatran hog-badger's degree of taxonomic uniqueness. The only modern taxonomic review of the entire genus, provided byPocock (1941), recognized A. hoevenii as a distinctive species, a decision overlooked by all subsequent checklist-compilers (e.g. Ellerman & Morrison-Scott, 1951, 1966; Corbet & Hill, 1992; Wozencraft, 2005).",

In addition to its unusual taxonomic introduction, this Arctonyx population intrigued us for several reasons. Apart from the Sumatran population, Arctonyx does not occur on the Sunda Shelf below Peninsular Thailand - that is, it is absent from the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Java, rendering the Sumatran population a geographically isolated form. Second, it seemed clear from our reading of the literature and our preliminary examinations of museum specimens and their associated data that unlike other Arctonyx, the Sumatran population seems to be truly restricted to montane forests, suggesting an ecological distinction between this disjunct equatorial population and other Arctonyx. Finally, it was immediately clear from initial examinations of museum specimens that Sumatran Arctonyx are morphologically extremely distinctive relative to other Arctonyx, most notably when compared with the geographically nearest population of Arctonyx from southern Thailand. It became clear that full elucidation of the distinctive features of Sumatran Arctonyx necessitated a comprehensive taxonomic review of the genus - as Allen (1929) noted, \u2018the precise relationships of the Asiatic hog-badgers still require to be more carefully worked out with adequate material.\u2019 This long-needed review of museum material is the contribution that we present here.",

Very few original measurements are available for A. collaris and A. albogularis, so we supplemented our comparisons with flesh measurements obtained from the literature (Thomas, 1922; L\u00f6nnberg, 1923; Allen, 1938; Pocock, 1941).

(Within Arctonyx taxa, a number of measured variables differ significantly between young adults and adults/old adults, especially zygomatic width, braincase height and interorbital width, but not condylobasal length.) Within all three Arctonyx species, no measured variable differed significantly between sexes in these comparisons, with a single exception - fully grown female A. collaris skulls averaged significantly larger (P= 0.01) in condylobasal length than males (N= 3 for females, N = 5 for males). However, this last comparison is based on very little data, because most adult and old adult skulls of A. collaris in our dataset (N = 18) are either somewhat broken (such that condylobasal length cannot be measured) or, more frequently, are not explicitly sexed. All three intact female skulls of A. collaris in these comparisons are from Peninsular Thailand, while all five intact male skulls are from India, Myanmar and Laos; thus, the difference between these samples might be attributed as much to locality as to sex. Condylobasal length in A collaris does not differ significantly between males and females when young adults from our dataset (representing more individuals from many other localities) are also pooled in these comparisons. Because there seems to be no clear pattern of sexual dimorphism in the genus, and because world museum samples of Arctonyx are rather limited, we pooled males and females in all morphometric comparisons, but where relevant, have discriminated between young adults on the one hand and adults and old adults on the other.",

Direct comparisons against mainland animals showed that Sumatran specimens were also distinctive in having relatively elongate rostra and pronounced sagittal cresting (despite their small size). These cranial distinctions are complemented by clear external distinctions: Sumatran Arctonyx are conspicuously darker than other Arctonyx, with the dorsum behind the head being mostly or entirely black, and with comparatively little white fur relative to mainland Arctonyx skins.",

None of the specimens that we measured fell into the intermediate range of lengths (i.e. 142\u2013150 mm). All specimens from China fell into the smaller size class, and all specimens from Indochina (Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos) fell into the larger size class, while amongst museum specimens from north-eastern India, both size classes were found. These size classes could usually be further distinguished on the basis of qualitative cranial characteristics. Animals in the larger size class usually have a large diastema between the second and third upper premolars (in both the upper and the lower jaws), conspicuously longer than the corresponding gap seen in animals in the smaller size class. Like the much smaller Sumatran animals, skulls from the larger mainland size class also possess a pronounced sagittal crest, lending the skull a more vaulted braincase in lateral profile. Close inspection indicated that the mainland Arctonyx size classes also differed in several external aspects, although these differences are more subtle than the differences in colour that distinguish Sumatran Arctonyx from other populations. Compared with the smaller size class, larger Arctonyx specimens from mainland Asia tend to have sparser and coarser pelage, with little underfur, a paler back, and a tail that tends to be longer, usually measuring about one-third as long as the head and body (averaging one-quarter as long in the smaller size class).",

Skulls from specimens at AMNH could be sorted using the same metric and qualitative criteria into a larger mainland size class (specimens from India, Laos and Thailand) and a smaller mainland size class (specimens from China). However, the material at AMNH narrowed the distinction in cranial length evident between the two mainland Asian size classes. Two young adult skulls from Fujian Province (AMNH 41475, condylobasal length 148.5 mm, and AMNH 57373, 143.8 mm) are larger than all other skulls referred to the smaller Asian size class, and approach young adult specimens of the larger size class in bivariate comparisons of overall size (Fig. 2). However, these skulls and their accompanying skins possess the qualitative features of the smaller mainland Arctonyx (lack of a marked premolar diastema, little promise of a marked sagittal crest, long black guard-hairs on the dorsum, heavy white underfur), and we thus classify these with the smaller taxon, with the suggestion that these skulls perhaps approximate the upper limit of cranial size seen in that species.",

The three taxa diverge along the first principal component, reflecting in particular differences in overall cranial size, and the clusters of both A. hoevenii and A. collaris diverge from A. albogularis also along the second principal component, reflecting in particular their more expansive braincases (in width and height) and smaller molars, in proportional terms.

We call attention to the fact that although only one species of Arctonyx has been admitted by all recent reviewers (e.g. Ellerman & Morrison-Scott, 1966; Corbet & Hill, 1992; Wozencraft, 2005), it was well established in the 19th century naturalist literature of British India that two distinctive kinds of hog-badgers overlapped geographically in the eastern subcontinent. Blyth (1875: 29) correctly diagnosed the two and called them the \u2018Large Burman sand-badger\u2019 and the \u2018Small Burman sand-badger\u2019, noting that \u2018both appear to have the same geographic range\u2019. Likewise, Bslanford (1888) recognized two species of Arctonyx and again emphasized key diagnostic features, such as the much larger skull of one [in his key, he diagnosed the larger as having a skull length > 6 inches (152 mm), the smaller with skull length <5 inches (127 mm. - anticipating the absolute difference in skull size that we document in this paper between A. collaris and A. albogularis; see below]. Sclater (1891: 290\u2013291) also discriminated the two distinct size classes as well, and noted that the distributions of the two kinds in India were \u2018probably the same\u2019. The possible geographical overlap of two Arctonyx taxa in eastern India was more recently posited by Rakamantha (1994), who noted during fieldwork in Manipur that \u2018reliable tribal informants claim that there are two types (subspecies?) of hog-badger within Manipur; the one being the fairly large animal displayed at the Zoo, and the second variety being smaller with dark spots on its body. This needs further investigation.\u2019 We suspect that the observations reported by Rakamantha do indeed reflect the local co-occurrence of two kinds of hog-badger in Manipur (as previously noted by Blyth, Blanford and Sclater), which lies at the juxtaposition of the recorded geographical ranges of the two taxa. The \u2018dark spots\u2019 on the smaller variety mentioned by Rakamantha probably reference the longer, darker guard hairs in the pelage of the smaller taxon, which sometimes clump and bunch, giving way to the underlying white underfur, generating the impression of dark\u2013pale spotting.",

The two animals on which the plate is based can thus be regarded as the original syntypes; these specimens were apparently never preserved in a museum collection after their death at the menagerie. The extremely thick-set body, massive head, proportionally long tail and pale (rather than predominantly blackish) dorsum of the animal figured in the original plate (Fig. 7) provide indications that Arctonyx collaris is the original name for the larger Arctonyx species of mainland Asia. In our assessment, the measurement of \u2018nine inches\u2019 (221 mm) quoted by Cuvier for the tail length of one of the syntypes (cf. Table 4) and discussion of the animals' coarse fur (F. Cuvier, in Geoffroy & Cuvier, 1825) further confirm these animals' identity with the larger species.",

            "text": "As noted above, some 19th-century naturalists in British India (Gray, Horsfield, Blyth and Blanford) correctly used the name A. collaris for the larger of the two Indian hog-badgers, and the name A. taxoides, erected by Blyth (1853), for the smaller badger (diagnosed based on its smaller size and longer fur; isonyx and taraiyensis, manuscript names for the smaller form, also appeared in the British Indian literature; Hodgson, in Horsfield, 1856; Gray, 1863). Pocock (1940, 1941: 429) criticized this early view, noting that \u2018these authors assume, on what evidence I cannot ascertain, that collaris was the name for the larger British Indian Hog-Badger, the most common form to the east of the Bay of Bengal.\u2019 Pocock instead used the name collaris for the smaller taxon (\u2018A. c. collaris\u2019, in his revision), and introduced the new name A. c. consul for the larger form, based on specimens from Mt Toungoo in modern-day Myanmar (Pocock, 1940). Pocock's (1941: 429) argument was based on \u2018geographical reasons\u2019. Although no specimens from the vicinity of Bhutan were available to Pocock (or to us), he observed that most specimens from that general neighborhood (he cites the type of isonyx from \u2018Sikkim Terai\u2019, a specimen in the Calcutta Museum from Darjeeling and an additional specimen from \u2018Assam\u2019) represent the smaller Indian hog-badger, which, according to Pocock, \u2018forcibly suggests racial identity between Cuvier's type and the Hog-Badger \u2026 of the Sikkim Terai.\u2019 We disagree with Pocock's attributions. Based on our review of museum specimens and Cuvier's original account, we instead follow earlier authors from British India in using the name Arctonyx collaris for the larger species, noting that both the smaller and the larger forms are known historically from the vicinity of the vague type locality (the border area between Bhutan and India; see Fig. 11). Because both taxa are known in the region and there has been considerable historical confusion about the precise identity of Duvaucel's original animals, we consider it profitable to designate a neotype for A. collaris. We have examined only five specimens from the Indian subcontinent representing the larger Arctonyx species (Appendix 2). Of these, only two are adults with a relatively firm locality, represented by both a skin and a skull (BMNH 43.152, young adult female, from \u2018Naga Hills\u2019, 3500 feet [Nagaland State, India]; and AMNH 171170, old adult male, from Nongpoh, Khasi Hills, Meghalaya State, India). Both of these specimens were collected in the broad vicinity of juxtaposition between India and Bhutan, the type locality as vaguely provided in the original description. We choose the latter specimen (AMNH 171170), the more mature of the two, as the neotype of Arctonyx collaris, and accordingly restrict the type locality of collaris to Nongpoh (25\u00b054\u2032N, 91\u00b053\u2032E), Khasi Hills (Meghalaya State, India). This specimen was collected on 13 May 1949 by W. N. Koelz, and is represented by a partially broken skull and flat skin (original flesh measurements: head\u2013body length 750, tail 190, hindfoot with claw 130, ear 40).",

We accordingly choose to fix albogularis as the appropriate name for the smaller Arctonyx of mainland Asia. The few specimens from the Indian subcontinent that we refer to albogularis (Appendix 1; including name-bearing specimens of taxoides, isonyx and taraiyensis) cluster in our comparisons and analyses with most Arctonyx specimens from China (including all of the species-level names applied to Chinese populations of Arctonyx, which we arrange within the synonymy of A. albogularis; see below).",

Externally, Arctonyx can be distinguished from Meles by its naked, distinctively hog-like snout; its pale (rather than black) throat; its pale (rather than dark) front claws; and by the morphology of the subcaudal anal sac, which is situated dorsad to the anus (as opposed to Meles, in which the subcaudal anal sac incorporates the anus; Pocock, 1941: 420). The skulls of Arctonyx and Meles are very different (Fig. 8). Relative to Meles, Arctonyx skulls have (among many other differences) markedly flattened auditory bullae; a more elongate, dorso-ventrally compressed, and much narrowed rostrum; proportionally smaller and more widely spaced cheekteeth; a more strongly curved upper incisor arcade; a notched (as opposed to simply U- or V-shaped) posterior postdental palate (formed by the pterygoid bones) that extends further behind the dental arcade, essentially reaching the auditory bullae; and a reduced angular process of the mandible, which is raised above the level of the mandibular toothrow. On the basis of the close genetic relationship between Arctonyx and Meles, Marmi, L\u00f3pez-Gir\u00e1ldez & Dominga-Roura (2004) recently suggested that the two could be regarded as congeneric, but the trenchant external and cranial traits that distinguish these two classically recognized genera argue for their continued distinction at the generic level (see also Bininda-Emonds, Gittleman & Purvis, 1999), especially now that both genera are no longer regarded as monotypic (see below).",

Incorporating fossil taxa, Arctonyx is considered to be the sister lineage to the extinct (Pliocene) Holarctic genus Arctomeles (Petter, 1971; Tedford & Harington, 2003). The close relationship between the Holarctic genus Arctomeles, the temperate Old World genus Meles and the temperate to tropical Old World genus Arctonyx provides a strong indication that the occurrence of Arctonyx in the tropics is a comparatively novel development in the historical biogeography of meline badgers.",

The holotype of taxoides is a subadult female, skin and skull, from \u2018Assam\u2019, deposited in the collections of the Zoological Survey of India in Calcutta (Pocock, 1941: 429; Khajuria et al., 1977: addendum) The holotype of isonyx is apparently a young adult female skin at BMNH (fidePocock, 1941), with skull lost but redrawn by Pocock (1941) from Hodgson's unpublished figures, from the \u2018Terai of Nepal\u2019 according to the original description and \u2018Tibet\u2019 according toAnderson (1879), but actually from the \u2018Sikkim Terai\u2019 (India) fidePocock (1941). The nomen nudum \u2018taraiyensis\u2019 was localized to the \u2018Sikkim Terai\u2019 in the original description. The holotype of leucolaemus is MNHN 1866-89, a mounted specimen from the vicinity of Peking (= Beijing), China (G. Veron, in litt.). The holotype of obscurus is MNHN 1870-535, a mounted skin and accompanying skull, from Moupin, Sichuan, China (G. Veron, in litt.). The holotype of orestes is BMNH 11.6.1.6, a young adult female, skin and skull, from the \u2018Tsing-ling Mountains, SW Shen-si\u2019, Shaanxi Province, 12 000 feet, China. The holotype of incultus is BMNH 2.6.10.35, an old adult male, skin and skull, from \u2018Chin-teh (Tsing-t\u00f6 of Stieler), about 150 km W of Hang-chow\u2019, Anhui Province, China. The holotype of milne-edwarsii is an adult female, deposited in the Swedish Museum of Natural History, from the Minshan Mountains of southern Gansu Province, China (L\u00f6nnberg, 1923). Pei's (1987) name Arctonyx minor, applied to a Pleistocene specimen from Guangxi Province, China, seems likely to be another synonym, but we have not seen the specimen on which the name is based or the original publication (published in Chinese; cf.

Its modern or historical range is not known to extend into Mongolia or the Korean Peninsula, nor to the islands of Taiwan and Hainan. The southern limit of the species is not known. However, amongst three Arctonyx skins without accompanying skulls, all taken at Lichiang, Yunnan, in early October 1916, one (AMNH 43095) is smaller and has the black back, longer and softer fur, and thick underfur typical of A. albogularis, while two others (AMNH 43159, 43160) are larger, have paler backs, shorter, coarser fur and minimal underfur, and are thus probably referable to A. collaris. Skulls would be needed to confirm the identity of these specimens definitively, but the characteristics of this series permit the suggestion that the boundary or area of overlap between the two species in southern China lies in Yunnan Province - a hypothesis in need of clarifying field investigations.",

Later, Pocock (1940, 1941) elected to recognize the nominal Indian form taxoides as a subspecies distinct from Chinese races on the basis of its perceived smaller skull size. However, Pocock had very few mature specimens available for his comparisons (and indeed very few mature specimens of Indian A. albogularis remain available in museum collections today). We note that the skull of an adult Indian specimen of A. albogularis at RMNH (marked \u2018Hindustan\u2019, condylobasal length 142 mm) demonstrates that the range of size variation in Indian specimens (condylobasal length c. 110\u2013142 mm) is broadly similar to that observed across all Chinese populations we have studied (116\u2013149 mm). In addition to recognizing three subspecies of smaller, northern hog-badgers (i.e. A. c. collaris of the Himalayan region, A. c. albogularis of southern China and A. c. leucolaemus of northern China), Pocock (1941) drew from Allen's (1938) tables of cranial measurements for Chinese hog-badgers to suggest that an additional, somewhat larger subspecies might be recognized from Fujian Province in south-eastern China.",

Pending further comparisons into the nature of this variation, we choose not to formally credit geographical variation in A. albogularis through the explicit recognition of subspecies, although both Allen's (1938) discrimination of A. c. leucolaemus and A. c. collaris (i.e. here A. a. leucolaemus and A. a. albogularis), and Pocock's (1941) suggestion of additional subdivisions appear to have some merit. We advocate a combined study of molecular phylogeography, craniometric variation and pelage patterning across the wide range of this species in India and China to evaluate more incisively the significance of geographical variation within badger populations that we refer to A. albogularis. Amassing appropriate samples will require the assistance of colleagues especially in China, whom we encourage to deposit relevant vouchers in Chinese museum collections to complement those samples, documented in part here, that are currently available in other institutions.",

It lives in burrows, dug especially along rivers and streams and under boulders, and apparently is solitary except during the mating season in April and May (Allen, 1938; Zheng et al., 1988). Young (litters apparently ranging in size from one to four) are born in February and March and weaned after about 4 months (Zheng et al., 1988). Unlike other species of Arctonyx, A. albogularis hibernates throughout the winter, from November to February or May, at least in northern China (Zheng et al., 1988). Zheng et al.(1988) reported two daily activity peaks for A. albogularis in Shaanxi, one at 03:00\u201305:50 h in the morning, and another at 19:00\u20132100 h in the evening. Northern hog-badgers are preyed upon by various large carnivores, including leopards (Panthera pardus), wolves (Canis lupus) and bears (Ursus thibetanus) (Zheng et al., 1988).",

Remains of small vertebrates (rodents, snakes, frogs and birds) were found in only 16% of stomachs.

The pelage is characteristically shorter and coarser than in other Arctonyx. The long guard hairs of the winter coat (outer hairs measuring \u2264 80 mm) overlap in length with but tend to be considerably shorter than these hairs in Arctonyx albogularis (outer hairs \u2265 70 mm), and the winter underfur is always much less dense than in A. albogularis. Arctonyx collaris also has a proportionally longer tail than A. albogularis or A. hoevenii, and longer and more massive claws than congeners, particularly on the forelimbs.",

The westernmost occurrence of A. collaris is probably defined by the Brahmaptura and Ganges drainages (see above). The exact northern boundary of occurrence of A. collaris remains to be established, but may lie in Yunnan. Apart from two skins from Lichiang, Yunnan, which we provisionally identify as A. collaris (see above, under A. albogularis), all specimens from China that we have seen (AMNH, FMNH, MCZ, MNHN, USNM) represent A. albogularis.

Similarly, most museum specimens from Thailand, Vietnam and Laos with associated elevational data derive from localities situated between 600 and 1300 m. There are only a handful of specimens of A. collaris in museums marked with elevations below 600 m; the lowest elevation given on a specimen label is \u2018100 m\u2019 (BMNH 15.12.1.8, Sai Yoke, Thailand). Duckworth (1997) noted that \u2018all recent records [of Arctonyx in Laos] came from above 500 m, but as all were in the same catchment, it is unclear if this represents a pattern of altitude, geography, or even just chance \u2026 All records were from forest, and elsewhere it occurs mainly in forest\u2019 (see also Duckworth, 1998; Duckworth et al., 1999). Long & Minh (2006) discussed recent records of A. collaris in central Vietnam (the Central Annamites area), where it was encountered in \u2018primary lower montane forest\u2019 at 900 m at one site, and in \u2018disturbed, primary hill forest\u2019 at 640 m at another. Based on our canvas of published accounts and specimen label data, we suggest that the seemingly patchy occurrence of A. collaris in Southeast Asia (Duckworth et al., 1999; Long & Minh, 2006) reflects its typical absence from lower-elevation habitats and preferred occurrence in little-disturbed hill and lower montane forests above about 500\u2013600 m. Undisturbed upland forested tracts possibly offer the best combination of sites for burrowing, diversity of food and escape from predation for A. collaris. The core elevational range of this species appears to lie between about 600 and 1400 m, with all records spanning 100\u20131500 m, but little information is available with respect to its upper elevational limit of occurrence. In their account of the mammals of Thailand, Lekagul & McNeely (1977) quoted the upper limit of occurrence as 3500 m for \u2018A. collaris\u2019, but we suspect this elevational information is based on high-elevation localities quoted for the genus in China or Sumatra, where species other than A. collaris are found.",

One notion that has been presented by previous reviewers is that Indochinese Arctonyx are smaller at more northern latitudes than in the south (Pocock, 1941; Lekagul & McNeely, 1977), although Osgood (1932) observed that \u2018specimens from southern Laos are fully as large as northern ones.\u2019 Our larger sample of specimens from the region offers little evidence for a latitudinal size gradient. In any case, many fewer full-grown skulls are available from northern Myanmar and Thailand (e.g. BMNH, MCZ, USNM) than from more southerly localities, and many skulls are too imprecisely localized (e.g. skulls labelled \u2018Siam\u2019, \u2018Vietnam\u2019, or unlabelled from Indochina at MNHN and BMNH) to be useful in assessing geographical variation. We agree with Osgood (1932) that there is no clear basis for the subspecific discrimination of the nominal taxon annaeus, named by Thomas (1921) on the basis of an immature specimen, from \u2018A. c. dictator\u2019 (which we do not distinguish subspecifically from typical A. collaris). Pocock's (1940) description of consul as a somewhat smaller race linking \u2018A. c. dictator\u2019 (i.e. A. collaris) and \u2018A. c. taxoides\u2019 (i.e. A. albogularis) was prematurely conceived, in part because the majority of his specimens were immature (and see Pocock, 1941: 499). Our study of nearly all available museum material of Arctonyx identifies A. collaris as a morphologically distinctive species with no evidence for morphological intermediacy linking it to either A. albogularis or A. hoevenii (Figs 2, 4\u20136), and identifies no clear basis as yet for characterizing geographical variation within A. collaris at the trinomial level.",

All of these are characteristic features of A. collaris. Pei (1940) discussed an additional record of \u2018Arctonyx cf. rostratus\u2019 from the Pleistocene of Jiangsu Province, further to the east. In the holotype of rostratus, condylobasal length measures 148 mm - i.e. closer to samples of modern A. albogularis (range 110\u2013149 mm) than A. collaris (150\u2013172 mm), although falling close to both (in the type the zygomatic arches are broken and missing, such that the skull cannot be plotted in our Fig. 2). Based on its qualitative features, we suspect that rostratus is best characterized as a synonym (or perhaps chronological subspecies) of A. collaris. If this is the case, Sichuan and Jiangsu specimens referred to rostratus indicate that the geographical range of A. collaris extended further north in the middle Pleistocene than today. However, we suggest that it is inadvisable to synonymize this fossil taxon formally before its morphometric and qualitative features are more conclusively compared against both A. collaris and A. albogularis. More recently, Long, de Vos & Ciochon (1994) referred Middle\u2013Late Pleistocene material of A. collaris from six different cave sites in Indochina and Thailand to \u2018A. cf. rostratus\u2019.",

Similarly striking is the range of dental size variation seen locally on the Bolovens Plateau of Laos and in peninsular Thailand (e.g. Figs 12, 13). Based on our museum studies of carnivores worldwide, we suspect that A. collaris shows more intrapopulational variation in molar size than any other carnivore species (Pocock, 1940), although molar variability is also striking in local series of Arctonyx hoevenii. This is an excellent avenue for further, detailed comparative ecomorphological study. We suggest that extraordinary cheektooth variability in Arctonyx may be tied to the greater comparative importance of vermivory in its diet relative to other badgers (see below). Committed vermivory in mammals is commonly correlated with evolutionary reduction or loss of molars and/or unusual molar size and shape variability (e.g. Griffiths, 1978; Rickart, Heaney & Utzurrum, 1991; Balete et al., 2007), assumedly reflecting the reduced importance of stringent genetic control in molar development in mammalian vermivores. Vermivory (and myrmecophagy) are also usually accompanied by a comparative elongation of the rostrum relative to related taxa (Anderson & Jones, 1967; Griffiths, 1978; Musser, 1982), as seen in Arctonyx relative to other badgers - assumedly an adaptation for digging through the soil with the snout.",

Their diggings were first seen at Bivouac No. 5 (7900 ft [= 2408 m]) where we found the skeleton of an aged animal. Some hair and cartilage were still adhering to the bones. Along a brook flowing through a deep ravine the badgers had dug many funnel-shaped depressions two or three inches deep. A heavy steel trap set there (baited with the carcass of a little jungle squirrel, Tomeutes) caught one; but the powerful animal pulled free, leaving only a bunch of hair. At Bivouac No. 7 (9300 ft [= 2835 m]) a badger burrow was found in the bank of a stream that flowed through a large \u2018blang\u2019 or alpine meadow. This burrow was about 10 inches in diameter; a large heap of debris had accumulated in front of it. In this area we saw the characteristic \u2018grubbings\u2019 of the badgers. Again, in a \u2018blang\u2019 between Bivouacs 8 and 9 the small funnel-shaped holes were so numerous as to pock the ground in all directions.

Apart from this specimen, the lowest record of occurrence for A. hoevenii is Holden's (2006) footprint from secondary forest situated at 700 m, where his camera-trapping suggested it was extremely uncommon. Setting the dubious Kuta Tjane record aside, the mean elevation of 25 vouchered sites of occurrence with recorded elevational data - a compilation drawing from museum specimen data and from other elevational records discussed by Robinson & Kloss (1918, 1919), Miller (1942), Van Schaik & Griffiths (1996) and Holden (2006). - is 1748 m (SD 800 m, median 1600 m). Judging from all available museum specimens and from records and discussion in the literature, we suggest that the core elevational and habitat range of A. hoevenii embraces montane forests and adjacent mountain meadows situated between about 800 and 2400 m, if not also extending higher (where little camera-trapping work or other mammal inventory work has commenced). The skull from the summit of Kerinci mentioned by Robinson & Kloss (1918) shows that badgers extend to the very elevational limits of Sumatra, at least on occasion.",

The \u2018funnel-shaped depressions two to three inches deep\u2019 dug by badgers along streams on Gunung Leuser, mentioned by Ulmer (above), are likely to be places where badgers shoved their muzzles into the earth to secure earthworms with their tongues - sign and behaviour reminiscent of New Guinea's long-beaked echidna Zaglossus bartoni (Opiang, 2004), an animal of similar size and habitat requirements that is a committed earthworm-eating specialist (Griffiths, 1978; Flannery, 1995). Jacobsen, Ulmer, and Robinson and Kloss all described abundant Arctonyx diggings in Sumatran mountain meadows, probably reflecting the species' searches for earthworms (Robinson & Kloss, 1918, 1919; Miller, 1942). A greater commitment to vermivory/insectivory may offer an explanation for the relatively reduced size of its cheekteeth, even compared with A. albogularis, to which it is similar in cranial size, and the great local variability in size of the molars, unusual for a carnivore species with such a restricted distribution. Although more intensive study is desired to clarify the proportion of earthworms, other invertebrates and other elements in the diet of A. hoevenii, we suggest that Arctonyx hoevenii can join the distinctive Southeast Asian hemigaline civets (Chrotogale, Hemigalus, Diplogale), the Malagasy endemic Eupleres, the hyaenid aardwolf (Proteles cristatus), and perhaps the Sloth Bear (Melursus ursinus) and Bat-Eared Fox (Otocyon megalotis) on the short list of carnivorans for which invertebrate prey constitute the dominant part of the diet (Davis, 1962; Von Ketelhodt, 1966; Albignac, 1974; Payne & Francis, 1985; Richardson, 1987a, b; Dang, Anh & Huynh, 1992; Joshi, Garshelis & Smith, 1997; plus data from museum specimens). As in A. hoevenii, the molars in these other invertebrate-eating carnivorans are reduced in size and complexity compared with their nearest, less-specialized phylogenetic counterparts (e.g. Gregory & Hellman, 1939; Ewer, 1973; Popowics, 2003; Sacco & Van Valkenburgh, 2004; Friscia, Van Valkenburgh & Biknevicius, 2007).",

More recently, various studies have shown Melinae, as traditionally constituted, to be a polyphyletic assemblage, with its component members sharing various traits that are either primitive amongst musteloid carnivores, or convergently derived (e.g. Radinsky, 1973; Dragoo & Honeycutt, 1997; Marmi et al., 2004; Sato et al., 2004). Mydaus is now classified with skunks in a separate carnivoran family, Mephitidae (Dragoo & Honeycutt, 1997). Melogale is now thought to be most closely related to a clade containing otters and musteline (weasel-like) mustelids, rather than other badgers, and is classified by some in the monogeneric subfamily Helictinae (Sato et al., 2004). The immediate relationships of Mellivora remain poorly established (Bininda-Emonds et al., 1999), but recent authorities have segregated the genus into its own subfamily, the Mellivorinae (McKenna & Bell, 1997). Finally, as noted above, the genera Meles and Arctonyx are closely related, and together apparently constitute the sister lineage to Taxidea. These lineages are now formally recognized by some workers at the subfamilial level as a restricted Melinae (Meles + Arctonyx) and Taxidiinae (Taxidea) (e.g. Marmi et al., 2006).",

Our discrimination of three species of Arctonyx in Southeast Asia complements similar studies of morphological variation across the geographical range of Meles (Abramov, 2002; Abramov & Puzachenko, 2005, 2006), which have recently argued for the recognition of at least three distinctive, allopatric/parapatric species in the genus -M. meles of Europe and western Asia, M. leucurus of central and eastern Asia, and M. anakuma of Japan (Wozencraft, 2005), although others have argued that these might be better characterized as subspecies (Kurose et al., 2001; Marmi et al., 2006). As with the discrimination of multiple species-level taxa in Meles (cf. Abramov, 2002; Marmi et al., 2006), our arguments for the recognition of three species of Arctonyx invite active scrutiny along other avenues of investigation, including studies of molecular divergences and phylogeographical patterning, evaluation of bacular and other postcranial skeletal distinctions, and field studies of behavioural and ecological distinctions between Arctonyx taxa, especially in the geographical regions that we have identified as boundary or overlap areas between the smaller, East Asian species A. albogularis and the larger, Southeast Asian A. collaris (i.e. in the southern Himalayan foothills and southern China).",

            "text": "The elucidation of Arctonyx hoevenii as a distinctive overlooked carnivore species endemic to montane Sumatra is exciting, but not necessarily surprising. The mountain chain of western Sumatra is a remarkable zone of biotic endemism, home to a highly unique biota (Stattersfield et al., 1998; Wikramanayake et al., 2002); nearly 15 bird species and many mammals are found nowhere else. Apart from the Sumatran hog-badger, mammal species found only in Sumatran highland forests (and/or grasslands) above c. 600\u2013800 m include the erinaceid Hylomys parvus (see Ruedi, Chapuisat & Iskandar, 1994), the shrew Crocidura beccarii (see Ruedi, 1995), the murine rodents Maxomys hylomyoides, Maxomys inflatus, Mus crociduroides, Niviventer fraternus, Rattus blangorum, Rattus korinchi and Rattus hoogerwerfi (see Musser & Carleton, 2005), the flying squirrel Hylopetes winstoni, and the rabbit Nesolagus netscheri (see Corbet & Hill, 1992). The muntjac Muntiacus montanusRobinson & Kloss, 1918, recorded from 1432\u20132225 m on Gunung Kerinci and at 2835 m on Gunung Leuser (Robinson & Kloss, 1918; Miller, 1942), is currently regarded as a synonym of the widespread species Muntiacus muntjak (see Grubb, 2005), but may possibly be an additional, overlooked Sumatran montane endemic, and deserves further investigation. Likewise, treatment of Sundasciurus altitudinusRobinson & Kloss, 1916 as a distinctive Sumatran montane squirrel endemic distinct from and sympatric with Sundasciurus tenuis by Miller (1942), which echoed the field- and museum-based findings of Robinson & Kloss (1918, 1919), deserves renewed attention, despite comments by Corbet & Hill (1992: 296). Several additional mammal species occur in Sumatra only in montane forests, but also extend to mountain block habitats elsewhere on the Sunda Shelf. These include the serow Capricornis sumatraensis, which extends to the mountains of the Malay Peninsula (Grubb, 2005) and is rumoured to occur in montane Borneo; the large murine Sundamys infraluteus, thought to extend to montane Borneo (Musser & Newcomb, 1983); the arboreal murine Leopoldamys ciliatus, found also in the mountains of the Malay Peninsula (Miller, 1942; Musser & Carleton, 2005); the weasel Mustela lutreolina, the shrew Crocidura paradoxura and the ground squirrel Lariscus niobe, all thought to extend to the mountains of Java (van Bree & Boeadi, 1978; Corbet & Hill, 1992; Ruedi, 1995); and the small pteropodid Aethalops alecto, thought to extend to the mountains of the Malay Peninsula, Java, Bali and Lombok (Kitchener et al., 1993). In all of these cases, further clarifying comparisons are needed to establish authoritatively the taxonomic equivalence of montane Sumatran populations with those from other distant mountain blocks on the Sunda Shelf. Regardless, on current evidence Arctonyx hoevenii can be recognized as the only carnivoran endemic to Sumatra.",

During cooler and drier episodes in the late Tertiary, such habitats extended to lower elevations than they do today, would have thus encompassed more expansive areas (Heaney, 1991; Janis, 1993; Brandon-Jones, 1996; Morley, 1998; Meijaard, 2003 and references therein), and may have ultimately facilitated the dispersal of temperate-adapted mammal lineages, such as badgers, to lower latitudes in Southeast Asia. Because these taxa are centred on hill and montane habitats in Southeast Asia, we envisage their former occurrence in similar habitats on the Malay Peninsula. Upland blocks in Malaya today are trivial in size compared with areas of relief in Indochina and Sumatra. During hotter and wetter climatic episodes in the Plio-Pleistocene, we assume that the small mountain areas of Peninsular Malaysia were insufficiently expansive to accommodate refugial survival of many montane faunistic elements that survived elsewhere (including Nesolagus, Arctonyx, Coelomys and Melogale\u2013see below), producing the current pattern of distributional disjunctness between taxa thereby isolated in the larger upland areas of Indochina and the Sunda Shelf. The small land area of Malaya's upland forest habitats probably afforded these areas sufficient isolation (and perhaps insufficient area for vegetational differentiaton along elevational gradients) such that later recolonization by certain montane-associated taxa was prevented even in cooler periods. Molecular divergence estimates apparently place the split between the two species of Nesolagus and between the Indochinese and Sumatran representatives of Coelomys within the Pliocene (Surridge et al., 1999; Chevret, Veyrunes & Britton-Davidian, 2005), and we suspect that the divergence between A. hoevenii and A. collaris is of similar antiquity.",

However, in contrast to Sumatra, where the endemic badger is an Arctonyx, on Borneo and Java (and adjacent Bali) the endemic upland badgers are species of the ferret-badger genus Melogale (M. everetti in Borneo and M. orientalis in Java and Bali). The distribution of Melogale extends from eastern and southern China to the Isthmus of Kra, absent in Malaya, with isolated representatives in montane Borneo and Java. Like Arctonyx, Melogale must have been present at some point in the past in Malaya and Sumatra. We suggest that in drier episodes during the late Tertiary, montane habitats extended to sufficiently low elevations to incorporate areas large enough to allow for the coexistence of both Arctonyx and Melogale, two temperate-adapted badger lineages. When montane forests retracted, upland areas in insular Southeast Asia were apparently not large enough to accommodate two badgers in sympatry, such that only one badger persisted in isolation in each of Sumatra, Java and Borneo, and no badgers persisted to modern times in the mountains of Malaya. Even in Pleistocene episodes of lower sea levels, when the Sunda Shelf was united with mainland Asia via an expansive land-bridge, appropriate habitats apparently remained sufficiently fragmented by non-forested habitats to prevent the Sunda Shelf's badgers from overcoming their long-term isolation by colonizing or recolonizing other Sundaic mountain blocks.",

According to Hancox (1993), zoos in six major cities had breeding programmes in place for hog-badgers in the early 1990s (Toronto, London, Milwaukee, Duisberg, Beijing and Yangon) and internet searching in May 2007 brought up many additional zoos that house Arctonyx, especially in Asia. Distinguishing between Arctonyx species in zoos will be important for educational as well as practical reasons. For example, different species should undoubtedly be housed in separate enclosures, and not bred together in captivity (i.e. if breeding between Arctonyx species is possible). Some consideration might also be made of their differential habitat associations in the wild (temperate climates for A. albogularis, mid-elevation subtropics and tropics for A. collaris, montane tropics for A. hoevenii) and possible differences in diet (perhaps more omnivorous in A. collaris and A. albogularis, and more vermivorous in A. hoevenii) in accommodating their husbandry and care.",

It is common in some areas, and present in a number of protected areas, but very little detailed information is available from most areas of occurrence in the region. Unsustainable hunting, indiscriminate snaring and habitat fragmentation from extensive deforestation (including deforestation in hill and lower montane forests; Pattanavibool & Dearden, 2002) are major threats to most of the larger mammals of mainland Southeast Asia (Wikramanayake et al., 1998; Duckworth et al., 1999; Marshall et al., 2006; Steinmetz, Chutipong & Seuaturien, 2006; Corlett, 2007), and these are likely to place Arctonyx under threat locally in many areas.

            "text": "The conservation status of Hubrecht's forgotten edentate cum badger, Arctonyx hoevenii, is probably secure at present. Records of occurrence document that its distribution extends across the entire length of Sumatra's Barisan range (Fig. 11). It is known to be common in some areas, is present in three national parks (Gunung Leuser, Kerinci Seblat and Barisan Selatan), and ranges even into the highest and most inhospitable reaches of Sumatra's mountains. It does face some threats. It is apparently an appealing food item (Schneider, 1905) and is probably traditionally hunted for local consumption in some areas, although this has no doubt long been the case, and as a result seems likely to be sustainable. Undoubtedly much more important is the threat from logging and forest clearance, which has been widespread and severe in Sumatra in recent years (Brooks et al., 1999; Jepson et al., 2001; Linkie, Smith & Leader-Williams, 2004; Miyamoto, 2006). However, unlike other hog-badgers, A. hoevenii rarely descends below 800 m elevation, and logging and forest clearance in Sumatra remain largely, though not entirely, concentrated in lowland and hill forests up to c. 1000 m (Kinnaird & O'Brien, 1998; Kinnaird et al., 2003; Linkie et al., 2004; Gaveau, Wandono & Setiabudi, 2007). If current patterns of forest loss in Sumatra continue unabated, such that logging in montane forests is accelerated, this will probably constitute a significant threat both to populations of A. hoevenii and to the many other remarkable montane-adapted animals and plants found nowhere else.",
