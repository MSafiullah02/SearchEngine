On January 20, 2020, the novel coronavirus was put on highest alert throughout China. On the same day, a special 24-h fever clinic was set up in the Emergency Department, Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). Doctors and nurses for this fever clinic were handpicked by the Emergency Department based on their experience and their adaptability and tenacity under pressure shown in their past works. Psychological support for these medical workers was deemed as essential [2] . Thus, a hotline service was set up by the Department of Psychological Medicine, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day, to talk with medical workers about their feelings, provide support and understanding, and help them find emotional resources. Furthermore, we continuously monitored these medical workers with qualitative and quantitative evaluations, regularly feeding back findings to the Emergency Department to allow for adjustments.",

PHQ-9 and MBI were administered at the end of their duty before a 2-week rest leave. Interviews were conducted whenever the medical workers were free, initiated either by us or them, during the 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. hotline service. Each medical worker was interviewed several times during their 2-to 3-week work time rotation. Each interview lasted 40-90 min.",

They all agreed to participate in our interviews and provided oral consent (response rate 100%). The participants comprised 16 doctors, 19 nurses, and 2 clinical technicians; 8 of the workers were male, and 17 were married. The overall mean age was 32.8 \u00b1 9.6 years. Mean working experience was 6 years (range 2-20). ily members was the most frequently reported coping strategy. Talking with colleagues was also useful for most participants. Two participants reported that they would rather cope with stress on their own, but they welcomed talks with psychologists through hotline. Other coping strategies included sport, singing, writing diaries, watching videos, etc. 8. Bodily discomfort. Of the 37 participants, 6 doctors and 11 nurses reported mild bodily discomfort including tiredness, throat pain, cough, neck and shoulder pain, back pain, headache and nausea, frequent urination, and skin rash. No medical worker was infected with COVID-19. The above-described bodily discomforts may likely have psychosomatic origins. 9. PHQ-9 and MBI (see Table 1 ). The higher rate of \"Personal Accomplishment\" burnout may be related to the fact there is still no definitely effective medication against COVID-19. Consistent with other similar situations, medical workers in our study were under high stress [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . However, overall, the emotional distress and burnout levels were not highly elevated. Our psychological support and adjustments may help buffer the negative impact of stress. In addition, we have to acknowledge that in such an emergency situation with a shortage of medical staff and resources, many doctors and nurses are overworking extensively. It is a new situation for medical workers [10] . We suggest monitoring the physical and psychological needs and wellbeing of medical workers in similar situations, and then adjusting their working schedules and formulating psychosocial interventions accordingly.",
