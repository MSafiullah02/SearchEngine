Two species of Cryptosporidium can be distinguished in cattle: C. parvum, which infects the distal small intestine (spherical oocysts, 5.0\u00d74.5 \u03bcm) and C. andersoni (syn. C. muris), which infects the abomasum (elipsoidal oocysts, 7.4\u00d75.5 \u03bcm) (Lindsay et al., 2000).",

(1980) attributed an outbreak of neonatal diarrhoea in calves to parasitization by Cryptosporidium. Some years later, Tzipori et al. (1983) and Heine et al.

Although the infection leads to few deaths, serious economic losses can occur because of problems associated with the resulting diarrhoea\u2014dehydration, weight loss and slow growth (Sanford and Josephson, 1982)\u2014and the costs involved in the treatment\u2014oral administration of electrolytic solutions and drugs\u2014and the application of suitable hygiene practices (de Graaf et al., 1999).

Furthermore, the significant difference between the effect of monthly and daily cleaning was maintained, although with a slight loss of significance (OR: 1.8; CI 95%: 1.1\u20133.1). However, calves kept in pens that were cleaned monthly were 87.0% more at risk of infection than those calves whose pens were cleaned daily. Weekly cleaning also led to a certain degree of risk of infection, although this was not significant (OR: 1.5; IC 95%: 0.9\u20132.5). There was a loss of statistical significance of the effect of disinfection of the floor by this analysis. Therefore, the type of flooring and the frequency of cleaning remained those variables which had a clear effect on infection by C. parvum in new-born calves.",

These authors suggest that the delay may be due to passive immunity acquired by the calves, which remain with their mothers for longer periods than in dairy herds. However, various studies have shown that passive immunity acquired via colostrum and maternal milk does not provide protection in mice and calves experimentally infected by C. parvum (Moon et al., 1988, Harp et al., 1989). Furthermore, Quigley et al. (1994) and Mohammed et al. (1999) observed a decrease in the risk of infection in calves which were separated from their mothers after only a few hours and fed manually. All of the calves in the present study were separated from their mothers immediately after birth, although they were fed with colostrum pooled from different cows, during the first few hours of their lives.",

However, Atwill et al. (1999), who carried out a study over a period of 6 months, used statistical analysis to show that in California, calves are at most risk of contracting the infection in the month of May, possibly because this is when the animals have most contact with the source of infection, or their resistance to the infection is low, or environmental conditions most favour transmission of the infection. In contrast, in a year long study on the prevalence of neonatal bovine cryptosporidiosis in France, Lefay et al. (2000) found that the lowest levels of parasitization were found in July and August. Taking into account these contradictory reports, we did not find any significant association between the time of year and the prevalence of infection. The values obtained fluctuated between a minimum of 34.5% in January and a maximum of 60.0% in February. The prevalence found in May, July and August was 44.5, 45.9 and 41.4%, respectively. We assume that the absence of notable climatic changes in Galicia throughout the year as well as the lack of a particular calving season explain our results. The absence of seasonality in the presence of infection has been described by Wade et al. (2000) in a study of 109 dairy farms in five regions in the southeast of New York state.",

Cryptosporidium infection usually does not cause a bloody diarrhoea due to the very superficial location of the parasite.
