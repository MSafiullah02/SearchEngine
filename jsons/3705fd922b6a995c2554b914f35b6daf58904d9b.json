Here we provided a comprehensive probabilistic analysis aimed at quantifying influenza-associated exacerbations risk for occupational asthmatics, based on a combination of published distributions of viral shedding and symptoms scores and lung respiratory system properties characterized by long-range peak expiratory flow (PEF) dynamics. Using a coupled detrended fluctuation analysis-experimental human influenza approach, we estimated the conditional probability of moderate or severe lung airway obstruction and hence the exacerbations risk of influenza-associated occupational asthma in individuals. The long-range correlation exponent (\u03b1) was used as a predictor of future exacerbations risk of influenza-associated asthma. For our illustrative distribution of PEF fluctuations and influenza-induced asthma exacerbations risk relations, we found that the probability of exacerbations risk can be limited to below 50% by keeping \u03b1 to below 0.53. This study also found that limiting wheeze scores to 0.56 yields a 75% probability of influenza-associated asthma exacerbations risk and a limit of 0.34 yields a 50% probability that may give a representative estimate of the distribution of chronic respiratory system properties. This study implicates that influenza viral infection is an important risk factor for exacerbations of chronic occupational asthma.",

(1, 2) Kondo and Abe (3) indicated that influenzainduced asthma may continuously deteriorate during the first two days of illness and may require at least seven days to recover. Murphy et al. (4) reported that influenza in patients with asthma can cause acute exacerbations, whereas in patients with COPD can lead to respiratory distress. Upshur et al. (5) and Martinello et al. (6) found that exacerbations of COPD are influenced by influenza. Wilkinson et al. (7) reported that a total of 70% of COPD exacerbations were associated with a bacterial pathogen Haemophilus influenzae and rhinovirus was identified in 20% of exacerbations. They suggested that changes in airway viral load and interactions between multiple pathogens and airway could modulate exacerbations severity. Wilkinson et al. (8) indicated that the consequence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) persistence in adult patients with COPD was associated with airway inflammation and could accelerate the decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ).",

Carrat et al.

Overall, the first dataset was reconstructed by taking into account 56 different studies with 1,280 healthy participants aged between 18 and 40 or 50 years. A total of 532 volunteers were challenged with an A (H1N1) virus, 473 with an A (H3N2) virus, 86 with an A (H2N2) virus, and 189 with a type B virus. The inoculum ranged from 10 3 -10 7.2 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) ml \u22121 . Most studies included daily follow-up with daily nasal washing and collection of clinical signs and symptoms.",

            "text": "We began by combining the respiratory symptoms scores and viral shedding dynamics data in experimental human influenza infections ( Fig. 2A ). Fig. 2A shows the similar trend for respiratory symptoms scores and viral shedding over time with nearly 1 day delay for respiratory symptoms measured, indicating that as the viral shedding increased, an increase in respiratory symptoms scores was observed. Our result shows that the optimized Hill-based regression equation y = 1/(1 + (b/x) c ) best describes the dose-response relationship between symptoms scores and viral load with fitted parameter values of b = 0.73 logTCID50 mL \u22121 and c = 1.45 (r 2 = 0.86, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B) . Similar to Fig. 2A , we then integrated the decrease in% PEF and viral shedding over time in experimental human influenza infection to explore the relationship between them (Fig. 3A) . The reconstructed decrease in% PEF and viral load profile reveals that the Hill function with a 10,000 MC simulation provided an adequate fit for the data (r 2 = 0.90, p < 0.001) with fitted parameter values of b = 6.75 logTCID50 mL \u22121 and c = 0.77 (Fig. 3B ). Given the dose-response relationships of viral shedding and respiratory symptoms scores together with decrease in% PEF for influenza virus infections in patients with chronic asthma (Figs. 2B and 3B) , we can construct a respiratory symptoms scores\u2212PEF profile that explains mechanistically the observed relations. We therefore found out that a best fitted Hill model of y = a/(1 + (x/b) c ) describes adequately the relationship between respiratory symptoms scores and PEF with fitted parameter values of a = 0.96, b = 445.81 L min \u22121 , and c = 11.94 (r 2 = 0.99, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4A ). Fig. 4B shows the predicted exceedence risks for both nonasthmatic and asthmatic individuals given the measured PEF distributions (Figs. 4C, 4D ) based on respiratory symptoms scores\u2212PEF response pro-file (Fig. 4A) . Our results indicate that the probabilities that 50% or more of the exacerbations risks induced by influenza infection are estimated to be 0.53 (95% CI: 0.45-0.61) and 0.11 (0.08-0.13) for asthmatic and nonasthmatic individuals, respectively (Fig. 4B) . On the other hand, for exceedence risks = 0.1 and 0.8, the asthmatic individuals have 0.90 (0.83-0.98) and 0.17 (0.09-0.25) of estimated respiratory symptoms scores caused by influenza infection, respectively (Fig. 4B ).",

This study implicates that influenza viral infection is a major risk factor for exacerbations of chronic occupational asthma. Our results show that viral infection was a highly significant risk factor for adults with chronic occupational asthma (exacerbations risk = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.45-0.61 corresponding to exceedence risk = 0.5) compared with asymptomatic controls (exacerbations risk = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.08-0.13).

The convex pattern of FEV 1 values had been evidenced in asso-ciation of ages. (40, 41) We considered that the PEF empirical equation for men (log e PEF (L min \u22121 ) = 0.544 log e age \u2212 0.0151 age \u2212 74.7/height (cm) + 5.48) was proper for our study (Table II) . On the other hand, the major PEF data adopted from Malo et al. (37) in our selected three scenarios did not describe the information of age for participant subjects. However, we found that the mean duration of exposure for participant subjects was 9.4 years. Moreover, Leroyer et al. (42) also reported that the averaged age and duration of exposure were 40.4 and 12.8 years, respectively. Hence, we reasonably assumed that the average participant age and body height was 40 years and 170 cm, respectively. Thus the predicted PEF was estimated to be 628.5 L min \u22121 , resulting in the PEF (% predicted) values in Table II of 80.6%, 67.1%, and 56.9%, respectively. Although Miller (43) proposed the recalculated regression (log e PEF (L min \u22121 ) = 0.755 log e age \u2212 0.021 age \u2212 104.1/height (cm) + 5.16) of PEF values for men, the proposed relative standard deviation (46 L min \u22121 ) was higher than the difference of two predicted PEF values (660.3 L min \u22121 by using recalculated regression, difference = 31.8 L min \u22121 ). Thus, results showed that the two PEF values were not significantly different. Moreover, if the recalculated PEF values replaced the used one, it did not affect the outcomes in this study.",

Using a coupled detrended fluctuation analysis-experimental human influenza approach, we estimated the conditional probability of moderate or severe lung airway obstruction and hence the influenza-associated occupational asthma exacerbations risk in individuals. Here we provided a comprehensive probabilistic analysis aimed at quantifying influenza-associated exacerbations risk for occupational asthmatics, based on a combination of published distributions of viral shedding and symptoms scores and lung respiratory system properties. We used a pharmacokinetic-based Hill equation to construct the relationship among respiratory symptoms scores, lung function, and viral dynamic because it is a dose-dependent biological response model. It also allows us to compare the cooperatively among different dose-response profiles that can explicitly show the responses are depending on the maximum respiratory symptoms scores/peak expiratory flow and viral titer. (44) We showed that the conditional probability functions of P(respiratory symptoms scores|PEF) and P(exacerbations risk|\u03b1) are robust indicators of the probability that severe asthma episodes will occur for influenza-associated occupational asthmatics. Based on the calculated correlation exponent \u03b1, this study found that limiting wheeze scores to 0.56 yields a 75% probability of exacerbations risk of influenza-associated asthma and a limit of 0.34 yields a 50% probability that may give a rep-resentative estimate of the distribution of chronic respiratory system properties.",

(45) to support the definitions of a 5-score system for wheeze symptoms in our study. Grazzini et al. (45) used the score from 0 to 4 to present none, 1-2 per year, monthly, weekly, and daily, respectively. In our study, we treated the wheeze symptom scores as normalized values from 0 to 1 for simplified and consistent reasons. Hence, the normalized wheeze values of 0.11, 0.34, and 0.50 could be considered as mild (none to yearly), moderate (yearly to monthly), and severe (monthly to weekly) conditions, respectively. The normalized value greater than 0.75 could be considered as a very severe condition (means episode with daily). Yet Mitra et al. (46) proposed a 4-score system (from 0 to 3) for describing the wheeze symptom. However, if future study used the normalized values that we estimated by the 4-score system of wheeze symptom, the severe conditions of patients should be redefined. That is to say, different score systems for wheeze symptoms decided the clinical cut-points (such as yearly, monthly, weekly, or daily). A limitation of the present analysis is the adopted study data. The published data that we used might not all be dependent and not equally likely, and might not be formally combined. They are used here to represent the applicable published observational data whose implications for exacerbations risk prediction of influenza-associated asthma have not been analyzed before. On the other hand, determining probabilistic exacerbations risk for future occupational asthma episodes caused by influenza virus infection is challenging, as it requires a synthesis of uncertainties along the cause-effect chain from viral infection to lung function variations. For example, uncertainties may exist in the PEF measurements, viral shedding and symptoms scores, and asthmatic responses. Uncertainties in future exacerbation predictions of influenza-associated asthma can be quantified by constraining the present risk-based predictive model parameters to reproduce temporal history of lung function fluctuations, asthma severity and stability, and fluctuating environmental stimuli (e.g., allergens, infections, and pollutants). (30) Future studies can use DFA to quantify the time-series environmental stimuli data and to correlate the relationships with lung function fluctuations.",

(30) Frey and Suki (30) suggested that a fluctuation analysis approach can be used to identify dynamic patterns in fluctuations of clinical symptoms of complex chronic diseases. To improve risk assessment of asthma severity, the fluctuation analysis approach can be applied to analyze the correlation properties based on observation of the long-term temporal fluctuations of clinical and physiological markers. From the perspective point of view toward health surveillance of occupational asthma, we hoped that the proposed DFA-based PEF scheme would (i) enable the early identification of adverse health effects in individuals, (ii) complement environmental monitoring in assessing control, and (iii) contribute to the process of hazard and risk assessment.",

For our illustrative distribution of PEF fluctuations and influenza-induced asthma exacerbations risk relations, we found that the probability of exacerbations risk can be limited to below 50% by keeping correlation exponent (\u03b1) to below 0.53. If the acceptable exceedence probability were 50%, this would limit a wheeze score of 0.34 or lower. Further theoretical and experimental analyses are required to achieve a better understanding of influenza-induced asthma exacerbations risk. However, we think there is room for further improvement, especially in better understanding the experimental human influenza infection of respiratory symptoms, the effect of influenza virus infection on PEF/FEV 1 in asthmatics, and dynamic disease of respiratory system-based fluctuation analysis.",
