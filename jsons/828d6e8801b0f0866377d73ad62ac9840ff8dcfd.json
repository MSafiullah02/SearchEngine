            "text": "Relative scores such as Local Outlying Factor and mass ratio have been shown to be better scores than global scores in detecting anomalies. While this is true, our analysis reveals for the first time that these relative scores have a key shortcoming: anomalies have greatly different relative scores if they are located in different regions where the curvatures of the density surface are very different. As a result, the lowscore anomalies could be ranked lower than some normal points. This revelation motivates (i) a new score called Neighbourhood Contrast (NC) which produces approximately the same high scores for all anomalies, regardless of varying curvatures of the density surface in different regions; and (ii) an anomaly detection method based on NC. Our experiments show that the proposed method which employs the new score significantly outperforms methods using the aforementioned relative scores on benchmark datasets.",

            "text": "Anomaly detection is an important task that has been widely used in many applications such as intrusion detection [20, 21] , clinical diagnosis [14, 15, 24, 27] , outlier image removal [18] , activity recognition [11] and power grid event detection [26] . One way to detect anomalies is using density-based scores. However, naively using densities to indicate data points' outlyingness does not generate satisfactory results. To detect both global and local anomalies, researchers have advocated the use of relative scores. For example, Local Outlying Factor (LOF) [5] computes a local reachability density ratio for each point based on a k-nearestneighbour density estimator; ReMass-iForest (RMF) [3] calculates the ratio of the numbers of points that fall into a leaf node and its immediate parent node in an isolation tree [16] . Local Outlier Probabilities (LoOP) employs the inverse ratio of probabilistic set distances [13] , which can be viewed as a variant of density ratio. These relative scores have been shown to produce better anomaly detection performance [3, 5] than their global counterparts such as k-th nearest neighbour distance [1, 4, 22] and path length [16, 17] . Despite their popularity, our investigation reveals a key shortcoming of these ratio-based relative scores which has not been identified previously. Existing ratio-based relative scores are designed to be sensitive to the local data distribution. However, we discover that such relative scores are affected by not only local densities, but also the curvature (i.e., the first and second order derivatives) of the density surface, which can yield undesirable outcomes. Figure 1 presents such an example, where anomalies A and B are located at low and high curvature surfaces, respectively. Existing scores RMF and LOF produce low score for A and high score for B, leading A to be ranked lower than some normal points. In other words, if two local density minima have the same density values, the one with a higher curvature will have a larger score. As a result, anomalies at locations of low curvature are harder to detect.",

A desirable score should produce large scores for all anomalies while being robust to varying density curvatures. To avoid the sensitivity to curvature, one can use a score based on contrast rather than ratio as follows: where I(\u00b7) is an indicator function returning 1 if the condition is met, and 0 otherwise. If x 0 is a local minimum, Eq. (2) equals to 1, regardless of the curvature at x 0 . Figure 1 (d) shows that the proposed new score Neighbourhood Contrast (NC) is such a score-it yields the highest score for these two anomalies in comparison with all other points. This figure is produced from NCAD, an algorithm which employs NC. We describe NC and NCAD in the next two sections.",

The reason for getting rid of h is because, in anomaly detection, we do not need to control the size of the maximum level node regions, which is designed for producing better clustering results.
