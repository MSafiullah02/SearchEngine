Effects of HIV infection that predispose patients to lung infections include depletion of alveolar CD4 T cells, impairment of humoral immunity, and functional alterations of granulocytes and alveolar macrophages [9, 10]. Changes in the causes of ARF were reported shortly after the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) [3, 6, 11]. The drop in HIV RNA levels and increase in CD4 T-cell counts induced by ART were associated with a reduced incidence of opportunistic infections and an increase in life expectancy [12, 13]. As a result of both primary prophylaxis and ART, the percentage of ARF cases due to PCP dropped from 70% to 20\u201340% [3, 4, 14, 15]. However, most of the available studies of ARF in HIV-infected patients were conducted before 2000, at a time when ART was not yet widely used, and more recent data are scarce [15\u201317]. Thus, the possible influence of ART advent on the causes and outcomes of ARF in HIV-infected patients is not fully understood.",

We sought to assess potential changes over time in term of ICU admissions, frequency of inaugural ARF, respective incidences of the 4 causal groups, and survival. Patient characteristics were compared according to the use of ART and the causes of ARF using the Chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test, as appropriate, for categorical variables, and the nonparametric Wilcoxon\u2019s rank-sum test or the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test for continuous variables. To investigate association between patient characteristics, use of ART, and hospital death, we first performed univariate analyses to look for a significant influence of each variable on hospital mortality by logistic regression, estimating the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Variables listed in Table 4 were entered into a backward, stepwise multiple logistic regression model in which hospital mortality was the outcome variable of interest.\n",

We included the 147 (54.6%) patients in whom ARF was the primary reason for ICU admission. Their main characteristics, stratified according to the use of ART, are reported in Table 1. Of these 147 patients, 5 (3.4%) were admitted twice for ARF during the study period. Etiological diagnosis and life-sustaining therapies requirement were similar in both ICU stays for 4 of them, and all were discharged alive from hospital after their second ICU admission, ruling out a potential bias induced by exclusion of this second event on statistical analysis. No patient had 3 or more admissions for ARF during the period. The number of HIV-patients admitted to the ICU for ARF increased throughout the study period (n = 43, 41 and 63 for subperiods 1996\u20132000, 2001\u20132003 and 2004\u20132006, respectively, P < 0.05), whereas the number of patients with ARF and newly diagnosed HIV infection (n = 43) tended to decrease (41.8%, 29.3%, and 20.6% for the same subperiods, respectively, P = 0.06) (Fig.1). At ICU admission, 43 patients were on ART overall (29.2%), without significant changes over the study period. No significant differences were found in terms of demographic characteristics, HIV risk factors, and co-morbidities when patients receiving ART were compared with those who did not (Table 1). Admission through the emergency room occurred in 89 (60.5%) patients. Severity of organs failures at ICU admission, assessed by the SOFA score, did not differ significantly between patients with and without ART use before hospitalization (Table 1). Noninvasive pressure support ventilation (NIV) was needed in 49 patients (33.3%), among whom one-third failed NIV and required subsequent tracheal intubation. Overall, 42 (28.6%) patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), 39 (26.5%) required vasopressors, and 11 (7.5%) required dialysis. Hospital mortality was 19.7% (29 deaths, including 16 in the ICU). Mortality did not change significantly over the study period (20.9%, 19.5%, and 19.0% for 1996\u20132000, 2001\u20132003, and 2004\u20132006, respectively) and was not significantly different across the 4 etiological groups (Table 2).\n",

The second most common cause of ARF was PCP, which was identified in about one-third of patients overall and in two-thirds of patients with newly diagnosed HIV infection. Pneumonia due to other opportunistic pathogens was diagnosed in 19 (12.2%) patients, with Mycobacterium complex tuberculosis being the most common pathogen (n = 8).

Patients on ART were more likely to be admitted for bacterial pneumonia or noninfectious pulmonary disease than other patients (P = 0.02). AIDS-related causes were significantly more prevalent in the group with newly diagnosed HIV infection (P < 0.0001). Neither the distribution of causes nor the prevalence of AIDS-related diagnoses changed significantly over the study period. Two or more causes were found in 33 patients (22.4%). Bacterial pneumonia was present concomitantly with PCP in 9 patients, other opportunistic infections in 8 patients, and noninfectious pulmonary disease in 8 patients.

By multivariate analysis (Table 4), 4 factors were independently associated with hospital mortality, namely, invasive MV (OR, 8.48; 95% CI, 2.91\u201324.73; P < 0.0001), vasopressor use (OR, 4.48; 95% CI, 1.13\u201317.84; P = 0.03), time from hospital admission to ICU transfer (OR, 1.05 per day; 95% CI, 1.01\u20131.09; P = 0.01), and the number of causes of ARF (OR, 3.19 per additional cause; 95% CI, 1.16\u20138.83; P = 0.02). None of the HIV-related characteristics (ART, CD4 lymphocyte count, and viral load) predicted hospital death.\n",

The 19.7% hospital mortality rate is consistent with earlier evidence of recent survival gains among critically ill HIV-infected patients [11, 17]. However, in the 2 latest series from the San Francisco General Hospital (1996\u20131999 and 2000\u20132004), almost 40% of HIV-infected patients with ARF died before hospital discharge, and ARF was among the critical illnesses associated with the worst outcomes in HIV-infected patients [14, 15]. Comparable findings were obtained in the early ART era [4, 6, 7, 17]. The lower mortality rate in our patients cannot be ascribed to lesser disease severity. Severity of organ dysfunction was comparable to earlier studies, with one-third of patients requiring invasive MV and one-fourth requiring vasopressor support. Differences in terms of HIV-related characteristics, such as CD4 cell count and HIV viral load, should be taken into account for the comparison of short-term outcome between other recent series [4, 15\u201317] and ours. Nevertheless, and as in these previous studies, we found that these variables were not independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.",

Fewer than one-third of our patients were on ART at ICU admission, in keeping with other studies [3, 11, 14, 15, 17], and this percentage showed no significant changes over the study period. It has been shown that the use of ART, together with the CD4 T-cell count, influences long-term outcomes of HIV-infected patients after ICU discharge [2, 3]. Our data suggest, however, that ART may have no influence on short-term survival of HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU for ARF. Similarly, no independent influence of ART on short-term outcome was noted in studies of HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU for any reason [17, 23]. In our study, ART use was associated with nonopportunistic causes of ARF and CD4 T-cell counts were significantly lower in patients with opportunistic infections. However, it should be noted that among the 104 patients with newly diagnosed HIV infection, CD4 counts and viral load were available in only 67 and 64 patients, respectively. Nevertheless, the severity of organ failure at admission, as reflected by the SOFA score, was not different between patients receiving ART and those who did not. Moreover, survival was not significantly different across the 4 etiological groups, and HIV-related causes were not independently associated with death before hospital discharge. Thus, improved outcomes in patients with opportunistic pulmonary infections, mainly PCP, may contribute to explaining the lack of a survival advantage in patients on ART.",

Thus, the fact that PCP was slightly more frequent in other recent series [15, 16] could have contributed to the better overall survival in our cohort. However, the mortality rate in our patients with PCP was the lowest reported to date, and this cause was associated with the best short-term outcome. This difference cannot be ascribed to differences in steroids use, as steroids have been extensively prescribed to treat severe PCP since the early 1990s [27]. Recent improvements in the survival of HIV-infected patients with PCP are related to advances in respiratory support modalities, such as the routine use of pressure support ventilation [28] and protective ventilation for intubated patients with PCP [29, 30], who consistently meet criteria for acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",

Transfer of HIV-infected patients from another ward to the ICU has been associated with higher mortality rates than ICU admission from the emergency room [8]. In another study, early intensive management improved the prognosis of patients with severe bacterial sepsis [31]. In our cohort, half the patients had ARF due to bacterial pneumonia, including 37.8% with septic shock. In two-thirds of the patients with bacterial pneumonia, faster ICU admission from the emergency room may have allowed earlier initiation of appropriate sepsis management. Thus, the lower hospital mortality rate compared to earlier studies [6, 32, 33], most notably in patients with bacterial pneumonia, may be partly ascribable to the policy of prompt ICU admission from the emergency department at our hospital. Furthermore, our aggressive diagnostic strategy supplied the etiology of ARF in nearly all our patients. Establishing the etiological diagnosis has been shown to improve survival [34]. Thus, our results suggest that hospital mortality of HIV-infected patients with ARF depends chiefly on the severity of organ failure at admission and during the ICU stay and that improvement in-hospital survival results primarily from advances in intensive care practices, as opposed to improvement in immune status and use of ART.",

            "text": "Our results support earlier evidence that bacterial pneumonia is now a major cause of ARF among HIV-infected patients [4, 6, 8]. ART reduces the risk of bacterial pneumonia during AIDS [35], although HIV-infected patients with mild CD4 T-cell depletion remain at increased risk [36]. This may explain why, despite ART advent, bacterial pneumonia was the most frequent cause of ARF in our study. Two studies found a decrease in the incidence of PCP-related ARF early in the ART era [3, 4]. In our cohort, PCP was diagnosed in one-third of patients overall and was even more common among patients with previously unknown HIV infection. That incidence of PCP remains high is in keeping with recent series from San Francisco and London, where PCP was the most common etiology [15, 17]. The fact that more than half the cases of PCP occurred in patients who were aware of their HIV infection suggests inadequate compliance with PCP prophylaxis. Poor compliance may explain why the frequency of PCP remained unchanged throughout the study period, although the frequency of inaugural ARF tended to decrease. The proportion of noninfectious non-HIV-related causes of ARF was considerably higher than in studies done before the advent of ART [4, 6, 24]. The immune system reconstitution and increased life expectancy obtained with ART expose the patients to exacerbations of co-morbid conditions unrelated to HIV infection, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or chronic heart failure. This observation is the main change in clinical and etiological patterns induced by ART.",

Second, we defined the use of ART and PCP prophylaxis as adherence to these treatments, as opposed to their prescription. We cannot exclude that some patients were misclassified as adherent or nonadherent by the infectious diseases physicians. Difficulties with the evaluation of adherence occur in all studies of HIV-infected patients, even those conducted prospectively. Third, our study was done in a single ICU, which may have led to patient selection bias. The population admitted to an ICU depends on local policies of admission and influences both etiological and outcome patterns [37]. However, HIV infection is not considered a reason for refusing admission at our ICU, and the characteristics of our population are consistent with those of patients in other studies [11, 17].",

Hospital survival has improved when compared with studies from the pre-ART era, which is not ascribable to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy. We believe that this evolution results from global progresses in intensive care practices, such as early ICU transfer from the emergency department or other hospital wards, NIV for PCP, and aggressive management of bacterial sepsis, even if our study was not designed to measure the individual effects of these procedures. Finally, we found that bacterial pneumonia was the most common cause of ARF in HIV-infected patients, even if PCP remains a major cause of life-threatening respiratory failure, most notably in patients whose HIV infection was previously unknown.",
