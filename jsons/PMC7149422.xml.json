Lipid-containing, or enveloped, viruses include: Baculo-, Bunya-, Corona-, Filo-, Herpes-, Lenti-, Orthomyxo-, Paramyxo-, Pox-, Retro-, Rhabdo-, and Togaviridae. Despite the great diversity of these viruses in regard to structure, replicative strategy, host range and pathogenicity, the function of the lipids in each case is the same \u2013 to form a membrane surrounding the encapsidated viral RNA or DNA genome. The lipids of the viral envelope form a continuous bilayer that functions as a permeability barrier protecting the viral nucleocapsid from the external milieu. Embedded in this bilayer are numerous copies of a limited number of virally encoded transmembrane proteins (often just one or two) that are required for virus entry into a potential host cell. These proteins mediate two essential functions: attachment of the virion to the cell surface; and fusion of the viral envelope with a cell membrane, resulting in accession of the viral nucleocapsid containing the genome to the cellular cytoplasm.",

Many viruses bud through the plasma membrane, but bunyaviruses bud through the Golgi apparatus, coronaviruses chiefly through the endoplasmic reticulum, and herpesviruses through the nuclear membrane.

It is assumed that the lipids in all viral envelopes are similarly arranged in a bilayer, based on those observations, and on the fact that the host cell membranes from which the viruses bud all contain bilayers, and also because it is the only physically reasonable arrangement of lipids that could supply the required protection from environmental stresses. Intact virions are impermeant to proteases and other enzymes. Indeed, virions can swell and shrink in response to changes in osmolarity, showing that viral envelopes are impermeant to small molecules and ions as well as large proteins, and thus must consist of intact bilayers that completely surround the encapsidated viral genome.",

Rafts are regions of the plasma membrane characterized by high concentrations of sphingolipids (sphingomyelin and sphingoglycolipids) and cholesterol. These components participate in the formation of separate, partially miscible phases, distinguishable from the more fluid phase(s) which are relatively enriched in unsaturated phospholipids. Raft and non-raft phases co-exist as contiguous bilayers, but diffusion is relatively restricted within raft phases, and exchange of molecules between phases occurs more slowly than diffusion within a single phase. Although the existence of local heterogeneity in lipid and protein structure has been demonstrated in cell membranes using a variety of physical and detergent extraction techniques, a precise definition of rafts has not been achieved. There is little agreement regarding their size, or whether they are nucleated by lipids or by proteins. Despite these uncertainties, certain membrane constituents are clearly concentrated in specialized regions rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol, and these have been identified as the sites of important cellular signaling and transport functions, and of assembly and budding for many enveloped viruses. Detailed lipid analyses of purified budded virions have confirmed their origin in rafts, and have in turn helped to define the lipid composition of virus-associated rafts.",

Because transmembrane sequences are inherently insoluble in water, integral membrane proteins require detergents for extraction from the bilayer and solubilization. When detergents and lipids are both removed from purified viral proteins, they tend to aggregate into rosettes, forming a kind of protein micelle, with the transmembrane sequences clustered together at their centers in order to maximize hydrophobic interactions and minimize contact with water. Purified viral membrane proteins can be reinserted into lipid bilayers of defined composition by mixing the detergent-solubilized protein with lipids, then removing the detergent by dialysis.

Binding to certain cell surface proteins may also promote endocytosis of the virus, by any of several cellular pathways. Endocytosis introduces the viral envelope into the lower pH of the endosome, which is required for activation of some viral fusion proteins.

Further activation of the virus\u2019 fusion protein gp40 occurs by interaction with a co-receptor, either the chemokine receptor CCR5 or CXCR4. In contrast, orthomyxo- and many paramyxoviruses have much broader specificity. Their recognition proteins (HA or HN, respectively) bind to sialic acid residues attached to various cell surface proteins or lipids. Different strains show preference for sialic acid in different covalent linkages. Rhabdoviruses such as vesicular stomatitis or rabies virus are still less specific, binding indiscriminately to negative charge clusters, whether created by lipids, proteins, oligosaccharides, or surface-bound polyanions. This nonspecific binding property helps to account for the broad host range of these viruses, although some have also been reported to bind specifically to acetylcholine receptors, which may explain their neurotropism.",

In most cases, several (probably 5\u20137) trimers must act cooperatively in order to complete the fusion reaction. One attractive idea is that the several fusion protein trimers encircle a limited area of bilayer, into which the fusion proteins can then transfer the energy released by their ensuing conformational transitions (Figure 2\n) in order to effect the lipid rearrangements required for fusion.

This is the helical hydrophobic sequence (around 20 residues) that defines the fusion protein as an integral protein, and fixes it irreversibly in the viral bilayer. The transmembrane domain is inserted into the membrane bilayer during synthesis on membrane-bound ribosomes and appears not to rearrange during subsequent processing, activation or fusion. Type I and type II fusion proteins possess similar transmembrane domains. Not all transmembrane domains can participate in fusion reactions; a certain amount of conformational flexibility is required.The transmembrane domain is required to complete the fusion reaction. Constructs in which the external, fusogenic domain of the influenza HA protein was attached only to the outer leaflet of the viral bilayer by a covalent bond with a lipid were capable of inducing hemifusion only, but were unable to complete the reaction.2.\nFusion peptide. This is a second relatively hydrophobic sequence that inserts into the cell membrane bilayer, and thus serves to bind the virus and cell membranes together. Exposure of the fusion peptide, enabling it to penetrate the target cell membrane, is an essential aspect of fusion protein activation, and requires a conformational change from a precursor form (Figure 2(b)). In type I proteins, this results from proteolytic activation; the influenza fusion peptides, for example, comprise the newly created N termini. Type II fusion peptides are located in a protruding loop of the protein structure, which is exposed by a poorly understood interaction with lipids, notably cholesterol. As with the transmembrane domain, a certain amount of conformational flexibility is required in the fusion peptide.3.\nA rigid, oligomeric rod-like structure connecting the fusion peptide with the transmembrane domain. This consists of a helical coiled-coil in type I proteins (Figure 2(b)), and an arrangement of \u03b2-sheet domains in type II proteins. Once the fusion peptide has inserted into the target membrane, fusion is completed by the rearrangement of this metastable structure to its lowest free energy form (Figures 2(d)\u20132(e)). In order to assume this form, the rigid oligomer folds back upon itself, forming a \u2018hairpin\u2019 (Figures 2(d)\u20132(e)), thus dragging the cell membrane, tethered by the fusion peptide, toward the viral membrane, tethered by the transmembrane domain. The free energy released by this rearrangement is transferred to the lipid bilayers, providing the energy necessary to complete the fusion reaction. In the final fused product, the fusion peptide and the transmembrane domain are adjacent to each other in the same membrane, held in proximity by the fully stable, rigid hairpin (Figure 2(f)).\n",

Hence, viral membrane protein synthesis is carried out on host cell membrane-bound ribosomes, which inserts them into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in the correct orientation (Figure 3). There they are glycosylated by the host cell machinery and assembled into appropriate oligomers, as directed by their own primary amino acid sequence. Most viral glycoproteins are then passed on to the Golgi by cellular mechanisms, where they are further glycosylated by host cell enzymes. For this reason, the envelope proteins of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), influenza, and a few other enveloped viruses have provided valuable tools to study the glycosylation and transport of membrane proteins through the cellular endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi\u2013plasma membrane system. Because host cell protein synthesis is often inhibited by infection with these viruses (by a variety of cytopathic mechanisms), large amounts of a single viral membrane protein are produced and correctly processed in infected cells, without competition by cellular proteins.",

The influenza HA protein, on the other hand, is glycosylated and delivered to the apical plasma membrane of the same polarized cells after passage through the intracellular membrane system. The retention of coronavirus glycoproteins by the endoplasmic reticulum, and of bunyavirus glycoproteins by the Golgi, reflects the operation of the same cellular mechanisms that retain resident cellular proteins in these organelles.

There is much less discrimination, however, between different viral proteins than between viral and cellular proteins, since viral envelope proteins of one kind can assemble with nucleocapsids of another, resulting in the formation of pseudotype virions. Pseudotypes have proven useful in redirecting specific viral genomes to alternate host cells since membrane attachment proteins are major determinants of host cell specificity (see above). It has been suggested that the discrimination between viral and cellular membrane proteins may arise from the exclusion of cellular proteins from virus-associated raft-like lipid phases.",

Some retroviruses assemble at the plasma membrane, while others do not; this has provided a classical basis for distinguishing between different types of retroviruses. Other viruses normally bud intracellularly, from the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus, for example, coronaviruses and bunyaviruses respectively, but these have also been observed to bud further down the pathway. In these cases, the nucleocapsid assembles on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, and then buds into the intracellular organelle.
