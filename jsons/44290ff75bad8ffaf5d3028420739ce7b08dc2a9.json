Recently, Chen et al. 14 also reported that ATA was an NS5B replicase inhibitor of HCV. Results in this study demonstrated that ATA is able to effectively inhibit EV71 replication through the inhibition of the elongation activity of the virus-encoded 3D polymerase (RdRp). It is noteworthy that the inhibition of EV71 by ATA may not be due solely to RdRp inhibition, and further investigations are needed to explore if ATA also affects other viral or cellular functions that are important for EV71 replication.
