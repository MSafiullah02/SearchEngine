Although they have been in human population all the time to some extent, the effects of epidemics are the most obvious and noticeable. Only in the 14th century Europe, around 25 million out of about 100 million individuals died from the Black Death [1]. Several diseases were discovered in America which included smallpox, measles, influenza, and typhus, whooping cough, the mumps, and diphtheria. Infectious disease was the main reason for the demise of the Indians [2]. In the early 1980\u2019s, some homosexual men in the United States were diagnosed with a type of fungal infection and a tumor called Candidiasis and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma respectively. Paris Pasteur institute in 1984 detected a virus responsible for those diseases and called it the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) [3].",

The virus is responsible for attacking and destroying the immune systems mainly the CD4+ T-lymphocytes or T-cells [1]. On a normal basis, these CD4+ T-lymphocytes or T-cells detect foreign and infected cells, and attack, spread and kill them [1\u20133]. HIV is able to infect CD4+ T-lymphocytes and insert its genome to host genome. This integrated HIV genome may exist in 2 states. They can be either transcriptionally active generating new viruses that can infect other CD4+ T-lymphocytes or in latent state which may become activated later. In transcriptionally active stage, the infected CD4+ T-lymphocytes die due to cytopathic effect of the virus. As a result, the number of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, which are able to recognize foreign and infected cells, declines, and this decrement lead stoper manent and lasting damage to the immune system [3]. The immune system finally loses its ability to fight and kill infections due to the number of CD4+ T-lymphocytes count which is so small. When an individual reaches this stage, the person is said to have AIDS [4]. The time between getting infected with HIV and advancing to AIDS is, in general, five years but changes due to many factors.

More important than these however, is simply the likelihood of an epidemic to occur that is whether there is sufficient transmission potential for a chain of infection to be sustained. This outcome is termed by a simple summary statistic: the reproduction number of the infectious process, R0. In a susceptible population, R0 represents the expected number of secondary infections generated by the first infected individual. If R0 is equal or greater than 1 an epidemic is expected. If R0 is less than 1, the infection is expected to die out [15].",

This is the expression for the force of infection. The force of infection is the probability that a susceptible will get an HIV infection per unit time. Therefore in a population of S susceptibles, the number of new HIV infections per unit time is given by \u03b1HS/N. Infectives are recruited through new HIV infections described above and removed through death at rate v and through natural death at rate \u00b5.
