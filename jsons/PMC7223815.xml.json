The Mid-South is a geographic area of approximately 30,000 square miles surrounding Memphis including western Tennessee, eastern Arkansas, northern Mississippi, and small portions of Missouri and Kentucky. Charts were reviewed for data regarding patient demographics, injury mechanism, severity of injury and shock, infectious morbidity, timing of ARDS, and outcomes. These data were merged with the patient data from the trauma registry (NTRACS version 3.5, Digital Innovations) to compile the database for this study. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was recorded as a surrogate for infectious morbidity. All episodes of VAP were diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (\u2265 105 CFU/ml in the effluent). Patients that died within 48 h of presentation were excluded.",

If the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov Test provided a statistic with a p value > 0.05, then the data were considered normally distributed. When the data were not normally distributed, a Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed for these continuous variables. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine variables significantly associated with the development of ARDS in the study population. Variables that had a p value < 0.2 on the initial univariable analysis were chosen as prospective covariates. The final multivariable model was constructed in a backward stepwise fashion to identify independent predictors for the development of ARDS.

This is much lower compared to the 7.3% seen in general ICU admissions [13] or the 12\u201325% of trauma patients reported by the previous studies [8, 14, 15]. Despite lower occurrence, the trauma patients who developed moderate-to-severe ARDS had a mortality of 40%, which is similar to what is reported by the other studies [2\u20138]. The reduction in ARDS occurrence may speak well for the improvement in patient management and prevention, but the unchanging mortality demonstrates that, rather, little advancement has been made in treating this condition.",

The inflammatory response to a unilateral insult can progress into bilateral pulmonary dysfunction if the dysregulated inflammation is of sufficient magnitude [18]. In 1999, Croce et al. evaluated 178 patients with post-traumatic ARDS and determined that there were two forms of pulmonary failure based on time to diagnosis [3]. The early ARDS (within 48 h after admission) was characterized by hemorrhagic shock with capillary leak. Late ARDS (> 48 h between admission and diagnosis) frequently followed pneumonia. Similar to the late ARDS group studied by Croce et al., mean time to diagnosis of ARDS was 6.2 days for those patients in the current study without chest injury. Furthermore, the development of VAP was also identified as an independent predictor of ARDS for this subgroup.",

Despite being less severely injured, patients without chest injury had significantly higher mortality compared to those patients with chest injury. As previously stated, VAP was found to be the only independent factor associated with the development of ARDS in patients without chest injury. However, the incidence of VAP in ARDS patients without chest injury was not significantly different from that of ARDS patients with chest injury (54% vs. 50%, p = 0.71), and, therefore, cannot account for the mortality difference between the two groups. These results suggest that VAP may play a role in the development of ARDS in trauma patients without thoracic injury, but it does not appear to be a contributor to the mortality difference between those ARDS patients with and without chest injury.",

Preventing the development of VAP in a critically injured patient is easier said than done. In 2005, the Institution for Healthcare Improvement introduced the concept of a ventilator bundle to improve the outcomes of mechanical ventilation and, thus, reduce VAP. The ventilator bundle consists of stress ulcer prophylaxis, deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, head-of-bed elevation, and daily sedation vacation with weaning assessment. However, in 2013, a prospective observational multi-institutional study found compliance with the ventilator bundle was not associated with VAP prevention. Nevertheless, over the last 2 decades, many advancements have been made in protocol-driven pathways for the early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of VAP that may serve to limit further pulmonary complications such as ARDS [19\u201321].",

Although these differences were no longer significant when trauma patients without thoracic trauma were examined, mortality was worsened by more than 11-fold. This finding further reinforces that ARDS is a different entity in trauma patients without chest injury. Although lacking thoracic injury may very well reduce the risk of developing ARDS, it does not attenuate the severity. In fact, the trauma patients without thoracic trauma seem to have worse prognosis if ARDS were to develop.",

In addition, this allows only for associations to be made, and cannot account for all potential confounding differences. Furthermore, the data points are limited by what can be collected through available records. Data regarding specific treatments or detailed ventilator settings that could affect mortality were not examined. In addition, patients with thoracic trauma were defined as having a chest-AIS greater than or equal to 1. Including patients with lower chest-AIS values may potentially over-simplify the cohorts. However, we did not want to risk including any patients with thoracic trauma in the non-chest injury group. Therefore, we felt this to be the purest method. Finally, the development of ARDS was not separated into mild, moderate, and severe categories as defined by the Berlin definition [22]. Approximately half of the patients in the study were admitted prior to the publishing of the Berlin definition, when the American\u2013European Consensus Conference criteria [23] were used for ARDS. The diagnosis coding in the trauma registry only allowed for the identification for the patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS.",
