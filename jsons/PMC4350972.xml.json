Patient received empirical Amoxicillin prior to hospitalisation and Cefuroxime in hospital without any improvement. For suspected allergic alveolitis prednisolone 40 mg daily for 8 days was administered. As a result of worsening of respiratory function on day 10 of initial hospitalization, the patient was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU). 1 gram of methylprednisolone once, followed by three consecutive doses of 120 mg/per day were administered. Pulmonary function deteriorated and mechanical ventilation was initiated on day 6 in intensive care unit stay. No signs of any other organ system dysfunction were evident. Antibiotic therapy was changed to Imipenem and Vancomycine. On day 11 of MV, the patient\u2019s respiratory function deteriorated substantially. The decision was made to transfer the patient to Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Klinikos (VUHSK) with facilities for ECMO treatment.",

The diagnosis of ARDS, HIV infection, nosocomial VAP and possible CMV pneumonitis was made. Colistin, Linezolid, Imipenem, Ganciclovir and Anidulafungin were started. ART consisting of Kivexa (Abacavir and Lamivudine) and Kaletra (Lopinavir and Ritonavir) was initiated. The patient was continued with MV, full intensive care and intermittent vasopressor support. Blood flow during ECMO was tailored to achieve acceptable oxygenation. Ventilator settings were reduced to protective ventilation mode. During the ICU stay, aggressive treatment of numerous nosocomial infections was required (Table 1). Complications during ECMO are detailed in Table 2.",

Also, we chose an aggressive preemptive approach to diagnose and treat nosocomial superinfections. Increased cardiac output, leaky capillaries, enlarged volume of distribution and impaired tissue penetration in septic patients may lead to an inadequate concentration of antimicrobial agent at the target site [10]. Also, due to sequestration and increased volume of distribution patients on ECMO are at risk of suboptimal antimicrobial therapy [11]. Therefore, there is a tendency to use higher doses of antimicrobial agents in critically ill patients. In our case, antibiotics were changed as soon as nosocomial bacteria were identified at doses that in many cases were considerably higher (Table 1) [12\u201314] than indicated in the drug label. We did not observe unacceptable antibiotic related toxicity.",
