As of March 29, 2020, 82419 people have been diagnosed as COVID-19 in China, among them 3306 ended up with death. Moreover, 582131 people worldwide were infected, and the mortality rate was 4.7%.

There was a borderline significant association for mortality risk in patients less than 60 years (adjusted OR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.19; P = 0.053) in comparison with patients 60 years or older (P interaction = 0.786). The adjusted OR for patients with normal body mass index (defined as BMI < 25 kg/m2) was 1.06 (P = 0.107), while in those with an elevated BMI the OR was 1.11 (P = 0.091). The difference of interaction was not significant between two groups (P interaction = 0.473). Moreover, increasing NLR still was a risk factor for death in patients with or without hypertension, and no evidence of interaction effect was found between groups (P interaction = 0.604).",

The study included 5 reactivated patients, among which one patient had progressive lymphopenia and progressive neutrophilia indicating the potential value of leukocyte counts on COVID-19 reactivation.15 Limited by the number of patients, difference of clinical outcome and lack of follow-up, the specific risk factors for in-hospital mortality remain to be identified.",

The high NLR results from increased neutrophil count and decreased lymphocyte count. The inflammatory response could stimulate the production of neutrophils and speed up the apoptosis of lymphocytes. Dysregulated immune cell responses and consequently immunologic abnormality are believed to play remarkable roles in the severity of virus-induced disease.16 When immune response is dysregulated, it would result in an excessive inflammation, even death. One of the most prominent factors associating with the severity and outcomes of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) disease is the hematological change in leukocyte populations.17 leukocytosis characterized by increased neutrophils and monocytes was primarily observed in several MERS-CoV patients, and all the deceased patients showed rapid drops of lymphocyte counts.18\n,\n19 Recent studies showed that higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and NLR in infected patients were correlated with the severity of the disease than did those non-severe patients, suggesting the involvement of cytokine storm in disease severity.6\n,\n20 These findings are consistent with our results. Furthermore, patients with severe virus infection are more likely to co-infected with bacteria due to low immune functions, which would be another possible reason to explain the increased level of neutrophils, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin shown in our study.",
