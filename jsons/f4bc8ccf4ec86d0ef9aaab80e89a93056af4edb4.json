Recent studies show that spike (S) proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may use the same host cell receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entering into host cells. The affinity between ACE2 and 2019-nCoV S is much higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S protein, explaining that why 2019-nCoV seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human. Here, we reported that ACE2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Basing on findings here, we propose that coronavirus infection can positively induce its cellular entry receptor to accelerate their replication and spread, thus drugs targeting ACE2 expression may be prepared for the future emerging infectious diseases caused by this cluster of viruses.",

ACE2 is the cellular entry receptor of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, which plays an indispensable role for SARS-CoV infection (Li et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 4 / 2 2 2020). ACE2 is a type I membrane protein expressed in the lung, heart, kidney, and intestine . Enhanced expression of ACE2 accelerates SARS-CoV infection and spread, while silencing of ACE2 blocks its entry into cells (Li et al., 2003) . Organs and tissues with high ACE2 abundance like the lung, kidney and small intestine are the infection targets of 2019-nCoV . Taken together, these findings reveal that the expression level of ACE2 is extremely important for the successful infection of SARS-nCoV and 2019-nCoV. Here we analyzed the various microarray database of virus infected-or inflammatory stimulated-animals and cells, and clearly show that virus infection including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can obviously upregulate ACE2 expression, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may use similar strategies to augment its infection and spread.

Here we analyzed the database of virus infected-or inflammatory cytokine-stimulated cells or tissues and clearly show that ACE2 can be upregulated by virus infection and inflammatory cytokine-stimulation. However, whether the upregulation by ACE2 by 1 9 / 2 2 the virus is achieved by virus infection-induced inflammatory cytokinesis is currently unknown. We already notice that the promoter region of ACE2 exists several immuneand cytokine-responsive transcript factor binding sites such as JUN. Next, we will evaluate whether ACE2 is upregulated by JNK signaling cascades. Importantly, the inducibility of ACE2 by inflammatory cytokines also implies that \"cytokine storm\" caused by 2019-nCoV not only damage host tissues but also may accelerate virus spread (Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020) .",

Thus, reducing ACE2 expression by siRNA or other drugs may be a direction for drug development. Because this cluster of viruses uses the same cellular receptor ACE for entering, thus preparation drugs which can reduce ACE2 expression may be useful for the future emerging infectious diseases. Our study also suggests that people infected by other viruses such as influenza or with high inflammatory cytokines may more susceptible to 2019-nCoV. This study also indicated that targeting the expression of ACE2 is a direction for drug development and infection control. ",

These results clearly reveal that ACE can be upregulated by infection of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Next, we evaluated ACE expression after other RNA virus infection. Data from microarray shows that the ACE2 mRNA level can also be strongly induced in human airway epithelial cells from 4 donors responses to rhinovirus (Figure 5)(Proud et al., 2012). In wild-type H1N1 influenza-infected human bronchial epithelial cells, ACE2 can dramatically increase to about 5-folds higher than the control group(Figure 7)(Shapira et al., 2009). These pieces of evidence indicate that ACE2 is a virus infection responsive gene and its expression can be stimulated by various viruses.
