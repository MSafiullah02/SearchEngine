Herein, we discuss recent discoveries that have furthered our collective understanding of the host immune response in protection from the constant environmental threats posed by bacteria, viruses, and fungi. We focus on interleukin (IL)-6 receptor-alpha (IL-6R\u03b1) deficiency and dominant activating Rac family small GTPase 2(\nRAC2) mutations leading to bacterial infection susceptibility, EROS deficiency and its impact on innate immunity, interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) haploinsufficiency causing susceptibility to Whipple\u2019s disease (WD), defects in IL-12 receptor subunit beta 2 (IL-12RB2), IL-23 receptor (IL-23R), RAR-related orphan receptor C (RORC), Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) contributing to mycobacterial disease, deficiency in IFN\u03b1 receptor-1 (IFNAR1), melanoma differentiation associated protein-5 (MDA5), IRF9, or IL-18 binding protein (IL18-BP) and gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in NLR family pyrin domain containing 1 (\nNLRP1) leading to viral infection susceptibility, and fungal infection susceptibility in the setting of caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) deficiency, zinc finger protein 341 (ZNF341) deficiency, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) haploinsufficiency.",

            "text": "Prompt recognition of bacterial pathogens is paramount in the defense against infection, and, among the mechanisms that initiate the immune cascade, IL-6 plays a central role. As a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6 leads to the initiation of the acute-phase response by driving the recruitment of innate immune cells and pathogen phagocytosis while also promoting adaptive immune responses through mediating B cell survival and maturation, T cell proliferation, and the lineage commitment of T follicular, T\nH17, and T\nH22 helper cells\n1\u2013\n3. Classical cell-membrane signaling of IL-6 is mediated through a hexameric complex composed of two IL-6 molecules, two IL-6R\u03b1 receptors, and two transmembrane glycoprotein 130 (gp130) proteins through which signal transduction is propagated via JAK and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) interactions\n4\u2013\n6. Iatrogenic, acquired, and inherited defects have provided evidence of the consequences of impaired IL-6 signaling through their impact on infection susceptibility. Severe staphylococcal infections have been described in patients treated with the anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody tocilizumab and in spontaneously acquired autoantibodies against circulating IL-6\n7\u2013\n9. Furthermore, inherited homozygous mutations in\nIL6ST, encoding the gp130 co-receptor, predispose to recurrent severe staphylococcal and streptococcal infections\n10 as well as elevated serum IgE and dental and cranio-skeletal manifestations reminiscent of hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) caused by dominant-negative mutations in\nSTAT3\n11,\n12. It was not until recently that inherited deficiency in IL-6R\u03b1 was identified. Specifically, Spencer\net al. reported two patients with severe recurrent infections with defective acute-phase response, elevated IgE, atopic dermatitis, and peripheral eosinophilia caused by pathogenic variants in\nIL6R\n13. An additional four patients from two unrelated families with\nIL6R mutations were also reported sharing a similar clinical phenotype with severe bacterial infectious complications caused by\nStreptococcus pneumoniae,\nStaphylococcus aureus,\nHaemophilus influenzae, and\nNeisseria meningiditis\n14 (\nTable 1). Mechanistically, shared among all of these IL-6 pathway functional defects is absent or delayed production of acute-phase reactants including C-reactive protein, which plays a crucial role in the protection against bacterial pathogens including Streptococci\n, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis through opsonization and phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils\n1,\n15\u2013\n17.",

Instead, inherited defects affecting the fifth protein, p40\nphox, result in severe inflammatory complications with modest infection susceptibility\n33.

A cohort of eight individuals with a homozygous null mutation in\nCYBC1 encoding EROS demonstrated a CGD-like disease with severe infections and associated colitis\n35. Patients demonstrated absent cytochrome 588b surface expression and severely reduced neutrophil oxidative burst. Interestingly, Thomas\net al.\n36 reported a Saudi Arabian boy with biallelic mutations affecting\nCYBC1 who, unlike the previously reported patients, suffered from recurrent sinopulmonary infections, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) (\nTable 1).

Of these rare inherited disorders, autosomal-recessive (AR) IL-12 receptor \u03b21 (IL-12R\u03b21) deficiency accounts for the majority of cases\n48. The\nIL12RB1 gene encodes for IL-12R\u03b21, which mediates IL-12 and IL-23 signaling via dimerization with IL-12R\u03b22 and IL-23R components to form IL-12 and IL-23 receptors, respectively\n49,\n50 (\nFigure 1). Similarly, mutations in\nIL12B encoding the IL-12 p40 subunit common to both IL-12 and IL-23 exhibit a clinical phenocopy of IL-12R\u03b21 deficiency\n51. Unlike most other MSMDs, a subset of patients with either of these two PIDs also carry susceptibility to chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), thought to originate from compromised signaling via the IL-23/IL-17 pathway that is important for T\nH17 cell development and mucosal immunity\n52.

The authors further investigated the impact of IL-12 and IL-23 on IFN-\u03b3 cellular responses by isolating several lymphoid cell types (i.e. B, CD4\n+ T, CD8\n+ T, \u03b3\u03b4\n+ T, and natural killer [NK] cells, type-1 innate lymphocyte cells [ILC1s], type-2 ILCs [ILC2s], type-3 ILCs [ILC3s], NKT cells, and mucosal-associated invariant T [MAIT] cells) from healthy donors. In response to IL-12 stimulation, B, T, \u03b3\u03b4\n+, and NK cells and ILC1s and ILC2s produced IFN-\u03b3, whereas only NKT and MAIT cells preferentially produced IFN-\u03b3 in response to IL-23. Interestingly, ILC3s produced IFN-\u03b3 upon either IL-12 or IL-23 stimulation. Taken together, these recent findings demonstrate the cooperative effect of these cytokines among a panoply of cell types to promote IFN-\u03b3-mediated protection from mycobacterial infection.",

Of the four JAKs, JAK1 is involved in multiple signaling pathways including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, IL-21, and IL-27 as well as the IL-6 and IL-10 families of cytokines\n61. As a result of JAK1\u2019s widespread function, its deletion has been shown to be lethal in mice\n62. To date, only a single patient with partial JAK1 deficiency has been reported (\nTable 1), resulting in a combined immunodeficiency complicated by atypical mycobacterial osteomyelitis, sinopulmonary and skin infections, flat warts, and severe crusted scabies\n63. Beyond infectious complications, the patient demonstrated developmental delay and an early death as a result of metastatic urothelial cancer at age 23. Functional studies demonstrated impaired JAK\u2013STAT phosphorylation leading to compromised responses to multiple cytokines including IL-2 and type I and type II IFNs. These broad signaling defects are likely responsible for the T cell lymphopenia and viral and mycobacterial susceptibility, respectively.",

Shared among these disorders are important elements in the host antiviral response as mediated through type I (and type III) IFNs. Type I IFN signaling occurs via binding of the IFNAR, composed of two subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. IFNAR then activates JAK1 and TYK2, which phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2. The resulting STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers translocate to the nucleus, where they assemble with IRF9 to form the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex, leading to the downstream transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) responsible for antiviral host defense\n69.",

Dominant-negative\nTLR3 mutations were initially recognized to cause defective intrinsic immunity of the central nervous system (CNS), impairing host IFN response to herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and underlying HSV encephalitis (HSE) in otherwise healthy children\n75. As previously described for dominant-negative TLR3 deficiency\n75, leukocytes from the patients with AD TLR3 deficiency demonstrated normal type I/III IFN activation. However, like patients with IRF9\n71 or IRF7 deficiency\n76, fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived pulmonary epithelial cells (iPSC-PECs) failed to control IAV replication. Importantly, the phenotype could be rescued in iPSC-PECs when treated with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03bb1, highlighting the importance of intrinsic type I and III IFN immunity for viral control in the lung\n73.",

HAV replication alone does not result in hepatocellular injury; instead, non-HAV-specific \u201cbystander-activated\u201d CD8\n+ T cells have been implicated in hepatocyte cytotoxicity\n90. The mechanisms remain unclear, but evidence suggests that co-stimulation by type I IFNs and IL-18 results in potent T cell activation and IFN-\u03b3 secretion\n91,\n92. IL-18BP is important in the negative regulation of IFN-\u03b3-mediated immune responses by binding IL-18 and preventing interaction with the IL-18 receptor. Belkaya\net al. reported a child who succumbed to HAV-induced ALF as a result of AR IL-18BP deficiency, demonstrating that the mutant IL-18BP failed to block IL-18 activity\n93 (\nTable 1). Additionally, they provided important\nin vitro evidence that IL-18 mediates hepatotoxic effects via NK cell activation and cytotoxicity and that treatment with IL-18BP rescues the phenotype, indicating that recombinant IL-18BP may have therapeutic value in patients with ALF\n93.",

The CNS-targeted susceptibility to\nCandida infection was recently elucidated. Specifically, CARD9 deficiency results in impaired recruitment of neutrophils into the\nCandida-infected CNS in mice and humans. The resultant CNS neutropenia, which is detrimental for control of fungal CNS invasion, is not due to peripheral neutropenia or impaired neutrophil-intrinsic chemotaxis but instead is caused by defective induction of critical pro-inflammatory molecules in the fungal-infected CNS that abrogate neutrophil trafficking from the blood into the CNS\n96. A recent follow-up study by Drummond\net al. shed further light onto the cellular and molecular basis of the CNS neutrophil trafficking defect of CARD9 deficiency\n97. Specifically, it was shown that, in response to the fungal peptide toxin Candidalysin, CARD9 is critical in CNS-resident microglia for the production of IL-1\u03b2 via both transcriptional regulation and inflammasome activation, which in turn activates the production of neutrophil-recruiting CXCL1 by CNS-resident microglia and astrocytes to promote fungal control in the CNS. Taken together, two-step tissue-specific \u201chits\u201d are operational in CARD9 deficiency; impaired IL-17 responses at the mucosal level allow for\nCandida translocation into the blood and from there to the CNS, where impaired IL-1\u03b2/CXCL1-dependent crosstalk between resident microglia and recruited neutrophils results in CNS fungal persistence.",

Furthermore, with the increased access and availability to molecular sequencing platforms, the number of novel and interesting variants is expected to increase at an exponential rate. Evaluating these coding, non-coding, and epigenetic variants will further our understanding of the function and regulation of the human immune system.
