The structure of the compounds thus prepared were confirmed by analytical and spectral (FT-IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and HRMS) techniques. All the synthesized indeno[1,2-c]pyrazol-4(1H)-ones (4a-o) were assayed for their in vitro Type II diabetes inhibitory activity by using Acarbose as standard drug and in vitro antimicrobial activity utilizing Streptomycin and Fluconazole as reference drugs. Among the synthesized derivatives, 4e (IC 50 = 6.71 \u03bcg/mL) was found to be more potent against \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme as compared with the standard Acarbose (IC 50 = 9.35 \u03bcg/mL) and 4i (IC 50 = 11.90 \u03bcg/mL) exhibited good inhibitory activity against \u03b1-amylase enzyme as compared with the standard Acarbose (IC 50 = 22.87 \u03bcg/mL). Also, all the titled compounds showed good antimicrobial activity. In addition, in vitro \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase inhibition were supported by docking studies performed on the derivatives 4e and 4o, respectively.",

The International Diabetes Foundation (IDF) reports that there were 425 million diagnosed cases of diabetes globally in 2017 which is estimated to increase to 629 million by 2045. Recently, there are more than 46 million diabetics in North America and the Caribbean, 58 million in Europe, 26 million in South and Central America, 39 million in Middle East and North Africa, 16 million in Africa and 82 million in South-East Asia. There are 352 million people at the risk of developing Type II diabetes (IDF Diabetes Atlas 2017). The emerging factors that contribute to the spread of Type II diabetes, comprising a progressively technological society, food habits with high calorie diets rich in fats and carbohydrates, and an increasingly inactive lifestyle (Wagman et al. 2017) . Type II diabetes is associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular disease, etc. It may also eventually cause tissue or vascular damage leading to severe diabetic complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy (Keri et al. 2015) . Out of several enzymes known, \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase are the key enzymes in the lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia observed in case of Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (Patil et al. 2013) . \u03b1-Amylase inhibits dietary starch from being absorbed into the body system and leads to lowering of blood glucose by the inhibition of salivary and pancreatic amylase (Ajiboye et al. 2016) . \u03b1-Glucosidase inhibitors have been reported to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetic mellitus resulting in the lowering of glucose absorption by carbohydrate digestion and increases digestion time (Chaudhry et al. 2017) .",

Structures of the newly synthesized compounds 4a-o were confirmed by their FT-IR, NMR ( 1 H and 13 C), and mass spectra. Their FT-IR spectra exhibited strong absorption bands at 1585-1608 (C=N) and 1693-1716 (C=O) cm \u22121 . The main characteristic feature of 1 H NMR spectra of derivatives 4a-o is the resonance of a signal appeared as a doublet integrating for one proton in the range of \u03b4 8.03-8.56 ppm, (J = 7.28-8.00 Hz), which was safely assigned to 8-H. Downfield shifting of this proton is probably due to anisotropic-diamagnetic effect of lone pair of electrons present on nitrogen/sulfur of benzothiazole moiety, which finds support from the results reported earlier (Mor et al. 2016) . The significant feature of 13 C NMR spectra of compounds 4a-o demonstrated the downfield shifting of signal due to C-4 (carbonyl carbon) which was observed in the region at \u03b4 182.64-185.16 ppm. However, the remaining protons in 1 H NMR and carbons in 13 C NMR spectra displayed signals in the expected regions. Further, the HRMS analysis results were found in consistent with their molecular formulae (vide experimental).",

The chemistry for the synthesis of indeno [1,2-c] pyrazole (4) involved the reaction of 2-acyl-(1H)-indene-1,3(2H)-diones (1) (3), which upon subsequent refluxing in glacial acetic acid afforded the target compounds 4 in good yields. Some of the synthesized compounds exhibited significant in vitro \u03b1glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity viz. 4e was found to be more potent with IC 50 value 6.71 \u03bcg/mL against \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme and 4i showed good activity with IC 50 value 11.90 \u03bcg/mL against \u03b1-amylase enzyme as compared with reference drug Acarbose (IC 50 = 22.87 \u03bcg/mL). Moreover, some of the compounds exhibited convincing results for antimicrobial activity, however, with a degree of variation. The antidiabetic activity was found to be more prolific than antimicrobial activity. In vitro \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1amylase inhibition was further supported by docking studies of compounds 4e, 4i, and 4o. Hopefully, these findings will prove helpful to medicinal chemists for the development of new inhibitors of enzymes related to Type II diabetes.
