It is important that the surgeon who is not experienced in the management of childhood cancer is aware that an apparently benign condition could be a manifestation of an underlying malignancy [71, 83] (Table 22 .1).",

We have heard of three deaths directly attributable to removal of tunneled long lines -in two cases the line was accidentally divided and then embolized, and once a septic thrombus was dislodged; in all three instances a fatal pulmonary embolus resulted. For this reason all our cuff ed line removals are done in the operating theater by the following technique. Unless the cuff is readily visible at the exit site a new incision is made proximal to the cuff and the fi brous tissue surrounding the line is dissected free. An incision is made in this fi brous casing in the long axis of the line to reduce the risk of severing the line. Th e distal part of the line can then be clipped and the line removed while a second person presses fi rmly over its point of insertion into the vein. Th e cuff can then be dissected out without risk of damaging the line or causing an air embolus. Th e incision and exit site are then sutured closed [30] . ",

Assessment of the risks of all possible causes is necessary to determine whether a laparotomy is required or if intensive medical treatment is preferable.

Acute systemic upset, with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal bleeding; commonly complicates radiotherapy to the abdomen and pelvis. Although these acute symptoms usually resolve relatively quickly, about 5% of patients progress to chronic complications aft er the completion of radiotherapy [35, 68, 117, 120] . Radiation damage to the bowel is dose dependent, although other factors such as previous operations, peritonitis, and concurrent chemotherapy (especially actinomycin-D) may all contribute to worsening the long-term problems [22] . More than one complication may occur and new lesions may develop at later stages; radiation enteritis should, therefore, be considered to be a progressive disease [35] . Complications related to the large bowel include proctocolitis, colorectal and anal strictures, rectal ulcers, spontaneous necrosis, and fi stulae to bowel, bladder, or vagina. Small bowel complications include bleeding, adhesions, strictures, malabsorbtion, spontaneous necrosis, fi stula, and poor anastomotic healing [117] . Bleeding and fi stula or perforation seem to represent the two ends of the spectrum of radiation enteritis suggesting that bleeding represents just mucosal trauma whereas full-thick-ness bowel wall damage must be present for perforation and fi stula formation [35] . Malabsorbtion of fat, vitamin B12, and calcium may also occur [22, 117] .",

If obstruction or fi stula makes operative intervention necessary then great care must be taken to handle the bowel gently and avoid resection wherever possible. A high incidence of anastomotic leaks follows bowel resection of irradiated bowel due to a compromised blood supply and poor wound healing. Extensive dissection of adhesions should be avoided and a side-to-side bypass operation considered in some cases. When a resection is inevitable, for instance aft er perforation or in response to chronic severe blood loss, then more generous resections should be made and the bowel temporarily exteriorized to avoid an anastomosis [35, 120] .",

Aff ecting agents include Candida albican, pneumocystitis carnii, C. diffi cile, cryptosporidia, giardia, CMV, HSV, rotavirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus. Cytomegalovirus infection is particularly associated with colitis and bowel perforation [43] . Investigation of diarrhea includes sending stool culture for anaerobic organisms, C. diffi cile toxin, and microscopy and culture looking for protozoa, fungi, or viral infestation. Viral infec- tion is of particular importance in the bone marrow transplant patients as clinically it is diffi cult to diff erentiate infection from acute graft -versus-host disease. Th e consequences of increasing the level of immunosuppression to treat graft -versus-host disease, when the patient is actually suff ering from viral colitis, can result in a fatality. Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy are useful in making the diagnosis by providing biopsies from aff ected areas of colon for histology [52, 122] . Histological examination of biopsies may show viral inclusion bodies or fungal colonies. Appropriate Clostridium-diffi cile-associated diarrhea is now a common problem in hospitals. Changes in the normal bacterial fl ora of the colon as a result of antibiotic therapy (especially clindamycin and in infants ampicillin) allows overgrowth of C. diffi cile with subsequent release of toxins that cause mucosal damage and infl ammation [50] . Clinical presentation includes mild to moderate diarrhea, antibiotic-associated colitis with or without pseudomembrane formation, and fulminant colitis (Fig. 22.6 ). Associated symptoms include abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea. In instances of fulminating colitis the patient presents with an acute abdomen, fever, tachycardia, and lethargy. Toxic dilatation may develop. Diagnosis depends on demonstration of C. diffi cile toxins in the stool; sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy and biopsies may be benefi cial as most disease is confi ned to the rectum or sigmoid. However, in 10 % of cases the colitis is limited to the proximal colon. Unfortunately, colonoscopy in these latter cases, in patients with fulminant colitis, may be complicated by perforation.",

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is particularly pathogenic in this region and may quickly progress to necrotizing fasciitis of the anorectal region [4] . Unlike the patient with an intact immune system where surgical incision and drainage of the abscess forms the basis of treatment, the immunocompromised patient should be treated primarily with broad spectrum antibiotics that cover anaerobic and Gram-negative organisms. Th e regime used includes intravenous benzylpenicillin, netilmicin, and metronidazole. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor may hasten the return of an immunological response though its role is yet to be proven. Constipation should be treated with stool soft eners and laxatives. Pain relief may be required. Th ese patients should be observed closely to make sure that no abscess develops when the neutrophil count rises and that the cellulitis does not spread resulting in a necrotizing fasciitis [4, 41, 75] . Indications for surgical intervention are obvious fl uctuation, a signifi cant amount of necrotic tissue, or progression to a necrotizing infection [44, 75] .

Mild acute disease simply requires cessation of cyclophosphamide with good hydration and oral analgesia [55] . More severe disease justifi es a more aggressive approach with cystoscopic evacuation of all mucosal clots followed by continuous bladder irrigation with 1-2% alum aluminum potassium sulfate for 2-3 days through a large-bore catheter; alternatively intravesical instillation of prostaglandin F2 followed by cystoscopy, diathermy of any bleeding sites, and instillation of 2.5-4% formalin. In very small children in whom only a very small cystoscope can be passed our experience has been that open cystotomy, clot evacuation, and diathermy of bleeding points can provide excellent control of symptoms and should be considered at an early stage.

Children with leukemia may present with acute testicular swellings which can be mistaken for other acute scrotal conditions, e.g., torsion of the testes, epididymo-orchitis. Th ese children have leukemic infi ltration of the testes (Fig. 22.9 ) and a biopsy usually confi rms the presence of leukemic cells in the testes. Th is is oft en a presentation in boys who have had treatment for leukemia and have relapsed aft er their treatment is fi nished. Th e testis is considered a \"sanctuary site\" for tumor persistence and may require irradiation.",
