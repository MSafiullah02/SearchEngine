Flood disasters are happening in countries and cities even under COVID-19 pandemics [4] . Improper response to flooding would spread COVID-19 and increase disaster damage, leading to further human losses and economic damage. Response activities without social distancing may spread COVID-19 among staff members of disaster management. If COVID-19 measures are overdone, flood response may be inadequate to decrease damage. Urbanization and development activities have increased flood risks by accumulating assets and population at risk areas, such as low-lying areas and steep slopes in urban areas [5, 6] . The communities in these risk areas are vulnerable to COVID-19 as well [7] .",

In the Sphere Handbook, the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and health chapters are relevant to the response to COVID-19. This handbook covers the approaches of promoting hygiene measures, establishing health systems and controlling communicable diseases. Furthermore, the additional guidance sets out the following three principles: (a) Human dignity: Respect for human dignity is fundamental to response operation. When people are afraid of being stigmatized for having COVID-19, they may hide the illness to avoid discrimination. (b) Community engagement: Hygiene promotion with a focus on handwashing and social distancing require full engagement of communities. Appropriate risk information is critical to avoid rumors and misinformation.

Current mechanisms and strategies for disaster resilience have the potential to enhance the responses to the Water and Sanitation: Frequent and appropriate hand hygiene is one of the most important measures to prevent infection with the COVID-19 virus. WASH experts and organizations are expected to use their capacities and experience to carry out a wide range of activities. They can (i) promote and facilitate good hygiene practices, (ii) maximize access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, (iii) ensure that vulnerable populations receive priority attention and (iv) protect water and sanitation workers [20,21*]. (v) Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami (GEJE): The experience of infection control following GEJE in 2011 would help in the response to COVID-19. The Japanese Society for Infection Prevention and Control reviews the measures of infection control during the tsunami disaster. Sakurai emphasizes the following knowledge is needed [22]: Response to disasters under the pandemic Disaster management organizations are required to take measures to control the spread of COVID-19 and need additional measures to disaster management. These measures become inefficient and costly for mitigating damages, and lead to delays, comparing with the current ones.(i) Humanitarian assistance: UN organizations for humanitarian assistance recognize that an inclusive approach of protecting every individual's rights to life and health is crucial in curbing the spread of the COVID-19 virus among refugees and migrants [23]. They are disproportionately vulnerable to exclusion, stigma and discrimination. The Inter-Agency J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Standing Committee provided guidance notes for operations in camps and camp-like setting in relevant areas covering mental health and psychosocial aspects, food distribution, protection from sexual exploitation and abuse, gender issues [24]. The committee is a high-level leadership committee for making decision and strategy of humanitarian response and consist of the heads of 18 UN and non-UN organizations.The member organizations of the committee estimate US$2 billion for additional funds to humanitarian response to the COVID-19 pandemic for nine months from April to December 2020[25].(ii) Cyclone in Pacific: International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies developed an emergency action plan to prepare for Cyclone Harold, which hit Pacific countries in April 2020[26]. This plan covers multiple scenarios that consider travel restriction in Pacific and the World. In the worst-case scenario of major damage, international support would be provided. Also, the plan assesses the risks of (i) delay in support because of travel restriction, (ii) increased demand for hygiene kits, and(iii) raised fear among the population on widespread of the COVID19 due to any incoming resources. Logistics of relief items became complicated. The Vanuatu Government eased restrictions on cargos of international relief suppliers while still imposing COVID-19 control measures [27]. (iii) Flooding in Canada: Manitoba Province, which fought against flooding caused by snow melting in April 2020, recommended methods for safe sandbagging and installing emergency barriers to ensure the safety of response workers. For example, workers repeatedly put soil into sandbags, carry and place them on the dike, while securing social distancing with two meters in the form of a carousel [1]. Ottawa City established a separate team to deal with flooding as the city responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. The city government asked organizations concerned and the public to follow COVID-19 restrictions by practicing physical distancing and conducting any work with five people or fewer [28].(iv) Flood disasters in Japan: Typhoon Hagibis damaged throughout the",

People have a right to live with dignity even in crises, and must always be involved in disaster management as Sphere Standard stresses [14]. This crisis is threatening human security, covering human life, livelihoods and well-being. (ii) Put priority on protecting human life at evacuation centers and of disaster management staff: Government organizations, disaster management staff and local communities would face a trade-off between saving people from flooding and curbing the spread of COVID-19 [26,28]. Local governments should compare the risks of flooding with ones of COVID-19 to prepare evacuation. Against disasters on the scale of cyclones in Bangladesh or tsunamis in Japan, the governments should lift requirements of social distancing and encourage people to take shelter to avoid direct threat to human life on a large scale. Against inland urban flooding, however, the governments would be better to require people to stay home, since inland flooding unnecessarily threat human life immediately. For evacuation for several weeks, if there were a risk of spreading COVID-19 at an evacuation center, the mortality ratio of evacuees would reach several percent under the worst-case scenario of crowded environment and limited health services. Disaster managers should allocate resources to priority areas. New approaches require more resources of financing, human, material than ones before the COVID-19 era [3]. Local governments should ensure the safety of their disaster management staff. As Canada and Japan conducted, the governments should require staff and volunteers to secure social distancing during flood fighting and disaster management works to avoid exposing them to the risk of COVID-19 infection [1,2].",

Since knowledge on COVID-19 is limited, informationsharing is crucial to avoid rumors and misinformation. Once the trust with local communities lost, engaging communities could become difficult.Information shared must be supported by scientific evidence[37].Scientists in health, water and disaster management should be involved in policy and decision making processes[19**]. Raising public awareness is the key in promoting community-based activities, such as hygiene promotion and social distancing. Experience of WASH experts would be useful for the implementation of public Coordinate with multiple sectors, in particular, water and health: As Sphere emphasizes, water and health sectors are crucial in controlling the spread of COVID-19 while managing disasters [13*]. Disaster J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f management mechanisms can be useful to coordinate various sectors [19**].
