            "text": "Since the introduction of dental implants, implant technology has been rapidly progressing with frequent production of new designs, materials, shapes, and surface treatments. Implants fabricated from titanium and titanium alloys are considered the gold standard in the field of oral implantology (Abraham, 2014) However, there are increased concerns that titanium can release metal ions and contribute to varying degrees of local allergic reactions, which have been suggested as a potential factor in dental implant failures that are often misdiagnosed (Chaturvedi, 2013; Harloff et al., 2010) In the presence of high smile line, titanium can pose an esthetic risk, particularly in cases of thin gingival biotype and/or gingival recession (Cosyn, Thoma, Hmmerle, & De Bruyn, 2017; \u00d6zkurt & Kazazo\u011flu, 2011) Additionally, the demand for metal\u2010free reconstructions is burgeoning. It is also claimed that the difference in elastic moduli between titanium implants and surrounding bone may cause stress transfer and probably result in peri\u2010implant bone loss (McCracken, 1999).",

Biocompatibility, osteoconductive, esthetic advantages, and interesting microstructural properties of zirconia ceramics make it a prevalent biomaterial in dental implantology (Al\u2010Amleh, Lyons, & Swain, 2010; Lughi & Sergo, 2010; Sanon et al., 2015). However, mechanical stresses and wetness exposure may have detrimental effects on mechanical properties of zirconia. The exact effect of aging on zirconia is not yet well known. Besides, zirconia implants may be associated with even higher stress peaks to the surrounding bone compared with titanium, due to its higher elastic modulus (210 GPa) (Andreiotelli & Kohal, 2009; Cionca, Hashim, & Mombelli, 2017; Lughi & Sergo, 2010). More recently, high\u2010performance thermoplastic material called polyether ether ketone (PEEK) has been proposed as a potential substrate for manufacturing physiologic dental implants.",

            "text": "Elastic modulus of PEEK is 3.6 GPa and can be further modified by impregnating material with filler particles such as carbon fibers or ceramic particles to achieve a modulus of elasticity close to that of cortical and trabecular bone (Stratton\u2010Powell, Pasko, Brockett, & Tipper, 2016; Toth et al., 2006; Vail, Krick, Marchman, & Sawyer, 2011). Considering the closer match of mechanical properties of PEEK to bone, the stress shielding of PEEK dental implants is less than that of titanium. The process involves reduction in bone volume around an implant due to the shielding effect of physiologic loads by the implant. PEEK is biocompatible, resistant to chemical degradation, high temperatures exceeding 300\u00b0C and exhibits strength properties that are comparable to some metals (Kurtz & Devine, 2007) However, when using PEEK as an implant substrate, the greatest challenge is represented by bio\u2010inertness of the material. Based on in vitro studies, unmodified PEEK was proven to be inherently hydrophobic in nature, with a water\u2010contact angle of 80\u201390\u00b0, which will affect the proliferation rate of surrounding cells (Thomas & Cook, 1985; Winkler & Mekayarajjananonth, 1999). A study comparing titanium, PEEK, and zirconia implant materials revealed that PEEK has the lowest bone implant contact, consequently compromising its osseointegration (Koch et al., 2010). Various techniques have been employed to improve the bioactivity of the material, among which are surface coating and surface treatment or a combination of both techniques (Ma & Tang, 2014). Such treatments led to modification of the roughness average values (Ra value) and wettability of material, which were said to influence BIC (Elias, 2011).",

Considering that the average %BIC for low roughness peek is 32.6 \u00b1 11.7 (St\u00fcbinger et al., 2013), a total sample size of 21 was required to achieve power of 80% and 5% significant level.
