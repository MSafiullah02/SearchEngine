To be eligible, participants should be adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 verified by patients' medical records, and clinically stable, as screened by patients' case medical officers. Participants were asked about their attitudes toward COVID-19-related online crisis mental health services, such as psycho-educational resources, and mental health counseling, using a standardized question: \u2018Do you think online psycho-educational resources and mental health counseling provision during the COVID-19 outbreak are helpful?\u2019 (yes/no). The amended self-reported Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist\u2013 Civilian Version (PCL-C) (Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993) was used to assess the severity of the posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the COVID-19. A total PCL-C score of \u2a7e50 was considered \u2018having significant posttraumatic stress symptoms\u2019 (Yang, Yang, Liu, & Yang, 2007).",

It is noteworthy that most COVID-19 patients suffered from significant posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the disease prior to discharge, and these symptoms may lead to negative outcomes, such as lower quality of life and impaired working performance. Following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the prevalence of PTSD in SARS survivors was 9.79% in their early recovery phase (Fang, Zhe, & Shuran, 2004) and 25.6% at 30-month post-SARS assessment (Mak, Chu, Pan, Yiu, & Chan, 2009). Our findings were significantly higher than that of Fang's and Mak's. The remarkable differences between these studies could be attributed to different clinical diagnosis and illness phrases (e.g., clinically stable COVID-19 inpatients vs. SARS survivors) and different measurements (e.g., self-reported instrument on posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the COVID-19 vs. clinical diagnosis of PTSD established by professionals). The rapid transmission of COVID-19 alongside with demeaning news coverage in widely used communication programs (e.g. WeChat and Weibo), and social discrimination toward COVID-19 patients may result in higher prevalence of self-perceived posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the COVID-19 in this study.",
