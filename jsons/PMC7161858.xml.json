            "text": "The synthesis of a membrane protein is literally done in a \u201cdensely packed environment.\u201d Starting from the ribosomal mantle the developing amino acid chain is transferred via the translocon into the lipid membrane. Within these confined environments the extramembrane parts of the protein is folded and the protein as a monomer is released. In the case of ion channels the monomers need to meet other monomers to finally adopt a quaternary fold in an either homo\u2010 or hetero oligomeric assembly. There is not very much information about how this last step is achieved, but it is envisaged that a diffusion driven movement within the lipid membrane is required to find the \u201cmates\u201d and to form a channel. With this in mind, the question arises whether the TMDs of a polytopic membrane protein would be able to self\u2010assemble on it's own without the help of a translocon machinery? Also, would self\u2010assembly allow generating higher structural order? Knowing the answers to the latter question would allow the manufacturing of complex biomolecules or design novel folds.1, 2\n",

The 3a protein is a 274 amino acid protein which forms a homo tetrameric potassium sensitive ion channel assembly.20 The protein is also part of a series of auxiliary proteins encoded by this virus.21 It is the largest viral channel forming protein found to date.15 Lowering the level of 3a expression in FRhK\u20104 cells with siRNA when infected with SARS\u2010CoV, leads to a reduced release of new virus particles. The protein is also involved in the upregulation of the expression of fibrinogen in human lung epithelial cell lines22 and activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u2010\u03baB).23 3a is proposed to harbor three helical TMDs.20, 24 In a computational approach first structural models of the monomer and the tetrameric channel are proposed.24, 25 Depending on the route of assembly, either the second (TMD2) or the third TMD (TMD3) is proposed to line the putative pore. Experimental data on the structure of the protein in any form is still lacking. Emodin, a plant derived drug, is proposed to inhibit channel activity of 3a.26\n",

Plotting I/V relationship of conductance states (see arrows in Figure 3) from selected traces show a rectifying behavior for both ions (Figure 5). The conductance is calculated from regression analysis for K\u2010buffer to be (13.3 \u00b1 2.1) pS and (10.3 \u00b1 1.9) pS at positive and negative voltages, respectively, and (50.7 \u00b1 7.1) and (23.3 \u00b1 3.1) pS, for positive and negative voltages, respectively, for the recordings in Ca\u2010buffer (Table I). The data for K+ reflect a lowering of the conductivity at negative voltage by about 20% compared to the value at positive voltage, and similarly about 50% for Ca2+. Comparing the conductance between K+ and Ca2+, delivers factors of about 3.8, at positive voltage and about 2 at negative voltages.",
