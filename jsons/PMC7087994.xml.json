            "text": "The 2013\u20132015 West African Ebola virus disease outbreak (hereinafter termed \u201cW. African Ebola outbreak\u201d) lasted more than 1 year and was longer and larger (65 times the next largest historical outbreak) than any prior outbreak, with 27,678 reported cases in 10 countries and 11,276 reported deaths as of July 15, 2015 (World Health Organization 2015a, b; Table 1). Most previous outbreaks have been localized to a single country, and only 7 have caused more than 100 known cases prior to 2013, with the largest of these affecting 425 people (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2014; Table 1). The unprecedented scale of the 2013\u20132015 outbreak highlights a critical weakness in our global battle against the threat of pandemics\u2014the lack of a well-funded, long-term strategy to pre-empt pandemic emergence. Pandemics originate from sporadic, but frequent emerging disease events that are caused largely by socioeconomic and environmental changes (Morse et al. 2012). As prior pandemics have occurred, societal response has included initiatives designed specifically to thwart their origin and spread, e.g., broadening of the International Health Regulations (IHR) following the SARS outbreak (Orellana 2005; Heymann et al. 2015). These initiatives are often coupled with surges of funding for basic and applied research to reduce future threats. However, these are often subject to waning public interest in the inter-pandemic intervals between perceived threats. For example, in the USA, the 2001 anthrax attacks led to a surge of funding to counter potential bioterrorism agents (\u2018select agents\u2019) much of which supported strategies of value to other pandemic pathogens (Morens et al. 2004; Khan 2011). The emergence of H5N1 avian flu and H1N1 pandemic flu each led to funding for the development and purchase of medical countermeasures (vaccines and drugs) and for basic science and capacity building in countries of high prevalence (Collin et al. 2009; Walley and Davidson 2010). Following the largest ever Ebola outbreak in 2013\u20132015, the US President requested $6.18 billion and Congress allocated emergency funding of $5.4 Billion for control and prevention programs (The White House Office of the Press Secretary 2014; Mikulski 2015). The World Health Organization (WHO) announced a $100 million emergency fund to avoid impacts of future emerging diseases (Reuters 2015). Here we use epidemiological and economic analyses to examine whether this could be considered another step in a boom-bust cycle of pandemic threat and response, or the beginning of a new strategy to pre-empt the repeated emergence of pathogens with pandemic potential. We then examine how these funds could be spent to best reduce the opportunity for future global health emergencies of the same scale as the 2013\u20132015 West African Ebola outbreak.\n\n",

Initial location was taken either from papers describing the history of the outbreak, from contemporaneous situation reports, or from ProMED-mail posts about the outbreak. For each location, where available, we recorded information on population density, using a variety of gazetteers and publicly available censuses. This information was only available for all outbreaks on the level of regional administrative divisions; many outbreaks occurred in small towns without a definitive \u201carea\u201d listed to calculate population density, or in villages too small to have population counts. We used population counts or estimates closest to the date of the epidemic. We recorded the initial cases and deaths reported from the first ProMED-mail posting for each outbreak which contained specific numbers of cases and deaths. For all outbreaks except one (2007, DRC), these numbers were below final counts. The first two outbreaks of Ebola occurred in 1976, before ProMED-mail was active. For one of these, we obtained the initial case count from the paper describing the outbreak; for the other, no such number could be obtained. Finally, we examined models of the 2013\u20132015 epidemic\u2019s early growth dynamics (Kiskowski 2014) to determine whether we should expect a linear association between population density and final outbreak size.",

The Hamiltonian includes three implicit prices or values known as conditional costate variables: \u03c11(t) represents the value of an additional unit of SICP capital, \u03c12(t) represents the value of a slight increase in the cumulative hazard on the discounted value of costs, and \u03bb(t) is value of a slight increase in the exogenous background hazard. Each of these values is measured in terms of the impact on costs, so that a positive value reflects a cost and a negative value reflects a reduction in costs (i.e., a benefit). For instance, in \u201cAppendix\u201d we show that \u03c11(t) < 0 because SICP reduces costs; the marginal benefit of investments in SICP, \u2212 \u03c11(t), optimally equals unity in an interior solution, thereby balancing this marginal benefit with the marginal cost of investment. We also show in \u201cAppendix\u201d that \u2212 \u03c12(t) is positive and equals discounted expected costs at time t. This means that \u03c12(t) < 0, as a larger y(t) in Eq.

Moreover, from our epidemiological analyses (Table 1; Epidemiological Analysis), and the literature (e.g., Gostin and Friedman 2015; Heymann et al. 2015), we assume the proximity of the recent Ebola outbreak to a large urban center was an important factor in its subsequent size, and future outbreaks near urban centers would have a heightened likelihood of being difficult to control.

There is reason to believe the values will fall within this range, particularly if we look to related, large-scale public disease eradication programs for guidance. For example, smallpox eradication cost roughly $300 million, or $2.1 billion in 2014 dollars. Efforts to eradicate polio have cost roughly $7 billion, and so far roughly $2.3 billion has been spent to prevent/eradicate malaria (Keegan et al. 2011).",

Considering only large outbreaks that have reached urban areas as uncontrolled, only the most recent outbreak counts as an event. There has been 1 uncontrolled outbreak in 38 years (the amount of time from the first outbreak to the present) or a risk of 2.6% annually (World Health Organization 2014a). We assume b(0) = 0.026. Due to concerns that background risks are increasing due to increased population densities and movement, we assume b* = 5% (i.e., a major outbreak once every 20 years). We calibrate \u03b2 so that it takes 15 years for b to equal 0.05. We note that with logistic growth, the trajectory for b asymptotes to b*. If we had required b to essentially converge to b* within 15 years, then b would become extremely close to b* within only a few years. Our choice of b = 0.95b* within 15 years essentially means b begins to converge to b* around this time. This requirement implies a baseline value of \u03b2 = 0.242.",

The baseline scenario consists of the \u201chigh Ebola\u201d case in the World Bank report where damages are estimated to be $32.6 billion. Damages are large due to the uncontrolled nature of the outbreak and include damages from the disease spreading to neighboring countries. We use this value to set Dmax = 32.6 billion. The World Bank\u2019s \u201clow Ebola\u201d damage estimates are $3.8 billion, which reflects a scenario in which the outbreak is contained quickly. We calibrate the parameter a so that 80% of the potential reduction in damages occurs for a SICP investment of N = $5 billion, which is roughly what the USA spent on the last outbreak. We believe the values in this baseline scenario are conservative. The damage values only represent 2-year estimates and they only include economic losses from the disease spreading to neighboring countries.

Our results indicate that a slightly larger value (~ 13.3% increase) leads to a small increase in optimal SICP investments, with total costs increasing and net benefits declining by a significantly larger amount due to the fact that an outbreak is more likely (e.g., the steady-state hazard rate has increased by 25% relative to the baseline). For the opposite case when lower levels of investment are required to eliminate risk in scenario 2 (a 90% decrease in Nmax), investment is significantly more efficient and is reduced by 50% in the long-run, costs decline by 66%, and net benefits of avoiding an outbreak rise by 71%. These results suggest SICP investments are not very sensitive to small-to-moderate changes in Nmax, but could be sensitive to extreme changes.",

            "text": "Our epidemiological results suggest that the 2013\u20132015 W. African Ebola outbreak was not structurally different from other smaller Ebola virus disease outbreaks and that factors other than population density or immediacy of global alert (e.g., border movement issues) played a greater role in leading to significantly higher numbers of cases (Carroll et al. 2015; Kramer et al. 2016). This provides context to our economic model and informs the suggested policy response through how we think about the probability of future pandemic outbreaks. Models of the 2013\u20132015 epidemic\u2019s early growth dynamics (Kiskowski 2014) suggest that we should expect no strong linear association between population density and final outbreak size. These models also lend weight to the notion that the proportion of outbreaks which are large may increase in the future. Community and household structure modulates the effect of population density on disease transmission (Kiskowski 2014). The stochastic nature of epidemics sees many (around 40%) initial outbreaks burn out with fewer than 150 cases. With small community mixing sizes (e.g., C = 5 outside-of-household contacts per individual), the distribution of epidemic size is skewed toward smaller numbers of cases. As community mixing size increases (representing more urbanized environments), the distribution of epidemic size becomes bimodal, with almost all epidemics which reach the survival threshold seeing over 1000 cases. This implies that while the 2013\u20132015 outbreak was not significantly different from past outbreaks, the increased interconnectedness of the area which it occurred in led to a larger overall outbreak. This is of course only one driver of the increased risk of an outbreak, and we can also consider land use change and climate change to be possible drivers. This is consistent with the 2013\u20132015 outbreak, where a major city (Conakry) was affected early in the outbreak [by the end of May 2014 when there were still less than 300 cases (World Health Organization 2014b)], whereas previous Ebola outbreaks were successfully contained in less densely populated areas. This may be because human populations at the region of origin have higher relative connectivity, pushing the virus more rapidly into urban areas (Wesolowski et al. 2014).",

However, the portion of funding allocated to SICP remains unclear and may not adequately reflect the benefits of SICP. By contrast, the pandemic fund proposed by WHO is correctly positioned for SICP but woefully inadequate. We find that a standing capital prevention stock of $970 million could provide expected savings of $10.3 billion in reduced costs from avoiding expected future emerging disease impacts. Maintaining this stock at a steady state, however, would require annual investments of $48.5 million. That represents a significant amount of funding by donors, and one that would be politically challenging. We argue that this would be best structured as a pre-outbreak investment in strengthening existing SICP networks, e.g., through the WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). This could involve strengthening GOARN to explicitly fund a reserve of mobile staff, equipment and laboratory capacity coupled with annual investments to maintain and expand this reserve over time. Staff and equipment could be deployed to leverage existing capacity in developing nations and emerging infectious disease hotspots (Allen et al. 2017). This also supports other calls for reform of national health capacities, including construction of a global health workforce reserve and investment in international health systems (Gostin and Friedman 2015).",

The Department of Health and Human Services released some details of their budget request, laying out a series of measures that addressed capacity building within the CDC allocation (Department of Health and Human Services 2015) (Tables 5 and 6). While this represented an advance toward building the preventive capital stock necessary for long-term Ebola prevention, without a direct commitment to development of a mobile outbreak prevention force and annual support to maintain this capacity, it was likely less than optimal.

Previous articles have likened pandemic prevention to military activities (Time Inc 2015), and there has been a growing interest in, and funding to support global health threats as concomitant threats to security (Global Health Security Agenda 2018). While there are clear moral and ethical differences between wars and pandemics, this metaphor has economic cogency\u2014for military and pandemic threats, investing in internationally-based rapidly deployable human resources coupled with strengthening of in-country infrastructure and capacity to curtail new events is economically optimal (Gostin and Friedman 2015). Defense departments use these approaches to counter global security threats. They create an overseas surge capacity (a \u2018standing army\u2019) and build alliances with partner nations, which include providing additional capacity to those partners. They also develop tactics to avoid redundancy in peace time. For EIDs, this could consist of trained responders based in regions prone to emerging diseases, with reservists stationed in donor countries. These international allies would be deployed first through networks like the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN)\u2014with significantly improved capacity. In the West African Ebola outbreak, international aid funds were used to supply equipment and staff to enhance clinical and diagnostic capacity, to purchase personal protective equipment, increase biosecurity, and more rapidly develop and test vaccines and therapeutic agents (e.g., Butler 2014). These measures appear to have been ultimately successful. But without continued funding, capacity building investments depreciate over time, making them temporary in nature. In addition, if these resources were already deployed overseas before the outbreak, they may have been distributed faster.",

A global pandemic fund, structured to produce a networked \u2018standing army\u2019 with international reservists to combat EIDs and to support ongoing costs of maintenance avoids this problem. This approach seems to reflect the goals of WHO GOARN (World Health Organization 2018). A straightforward solution to the pandemic threat may be a better-funded GOARN with a line item commitment for donor funding that cannot be significantly degraded between outbreaks or in global recessions, as seems to have occurred prior to the recent Ebola outbreak (Gostin and Friedman 2015; Heymann et al. 2015). This could be enhanced with a formal link to in-country programs that use development aid to build capacity to counter the pandemic threat (Gostin and Friedman 2015). Examples recently proposed include the FAO-OIE-WHO \u201cOne Health\u201d approach to building biosecurity around livestock farms in countries where prior influenza outbreaks have originated (World Bank 2008), and the USAID \u201cEmerging Pandemic Threats\u201d program that targets novel and known emerging zoonoses in EID hotspots (Morse et al. 2012). While an international network of reservist experts would be needed to support this approach, a focus on building a standing army of local first-responders in at risk nations built around EID hotspots would logically provide the best allocation of resources. It also suggests that continued funding for global health security in countries at high risk of pandemic emergence could be a critical step to optimizing prevention and response to their threat (Global Health Security Agenda 2018).",

When we consider the impact of resources invested in affordable care in developing countries and the protection of developed nations, the benefits of prevention are greater, which suggests a strategy of even more investment.",

            "text": "Like major earthquakes or category 5 hurricanes, pandemics emerge stochastically from a background of frequent EID events that are predominantly zoonotic in nature and originate in tropical countries (Jones et al. 2008). These events are increasing in frequency as their underlying socioeconomic and environmental drivers expand (Jones et al. 2008). Furthermore, progressively globalized patterns of travel and trade result in an increasing risk of each new outbreak becoming a pandemic (Hosseini et al. 2010). This leads to a straightforward economic problem\u2014there is an interval of time within which we must launch an effective global effort to pre-empt future events. If we wait too long, the probability of an outbreak accelerates and may lead to preemptive action being unfeasible or obsolete (Pike et al. 2014). Thus, while the deliberations on the size and nature of the WHO pandemic fund continue, the US government appropriation for Ebola response was used to combat to the outbreak of Zika virus, and depleted as a reserve for future pandemics. We therefore urge that a collective global strategy to combat future emerging disease threats is urgently formed, based on sound economic analysis, and focused on the countries where future emerging diseases are most likely to originate.",

We assume initial capital stocks are negligible and that the initial background hazard rate is 2.6% and growing.

After this initial investment, smaller investments in SICP are required to increase the capital stock as the background risk level increases to its steady-state value, after which investments only occur to offset the effects of depreciation.
