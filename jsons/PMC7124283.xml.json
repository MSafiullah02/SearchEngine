Regardless of travel history or known or suspected infectious pathogen, every patient interaction should include an assessment of the risk of exposure to bodily fluids (including respiratory or eye secretions) to the health care worker and the appropriate PPE should be selected.9\n,\n15 The WHO also notes that a number of aerosol-generating medical procedures, including tracheal intubation and manual ventilation, have been associated with an increased risk of coronavirus transmission.12, 13, 14 As a result, health care workers engaging in such aerosol-generating medical procedures should additionally use a certified N95 mask.12, 13, 14 As always, for patients suspected of having an infectious red eye, it is imperative to follow disinfection practices that have already been outlined to prevent the spread of viral infection before and after each patient visit. Given that COVID-19 is due to an enveloped virus, it is susceptible to the alcohol and bleach disinfectants that are typically used in current ophthalmic practice.16\n",
