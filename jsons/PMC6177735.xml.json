More recently, bats have been increasingly recognized as an important reservoir harboring numerous pathogenic viruses while displaying minimal clinical signs of disease [3]. Indeed, comparing the genomes of bats with the genomes of other mammalian species has revealed an unexpected concentration of positively selected genes. These include those involved in DNA damage repair and innate immune functions, which may partially explain bats\u2019 unique tolerance to deadly viruses and their unusually long life span [4]. Together, this highlights bats as an emerging model organism in the study of ecology, development, aging, and evolution.",

To date, there are 14 draft bat genomes that are published and deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (Eidolon helvum, Eptesicus fuscus, Hipposideros armiger, Megaderma lyra, Miniopterus natalensis, Myotis brandtii, Myotis davidii, Myotis lucifugus, Pteropus alecto, Pteronotus parnellii, Pteropus vampyrus, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus sinicus, Rousettus aegyptiacus; Supplementary Table S1) [2, 4\u20137]. Most of these genomes were assembled using only short Illumina sequencing reads (49\u2013150 bp), with the exception of R. aegyptiacus, which utilized both short reads (data not released) from the Illumina HiSeq platform and long reads (data not released) from the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) platform, resulting in a hybrid genome assembly. The long-read length of PacBio sequencing, which is available for both DNA and RNA sequencing (also known as isoform sequencing [Iso-Seq]), has shown considerable promise in genomics studies. For example, PacBio DNA sequencing has improved assembly of the human [8], gorilla [9], loblolly pine [10], and avian genomes [11], while Iso-Seq has helped deepen our understanding of alternative splicing in the chicken [12], coffee bean [13], and maize [14] transcriptomes.",

We hoped the PacBio long-read technology would facilitate accuracy in annotating this evolutionary divergent species. Eonycteris spelaea is a specialist nectar-feeding bat that feeds predominantly on nectar and pollen. It is widely distributed over both the tropics and subtropics, throughout the Indomalayan region [15\u201317]. This species has been associated with pollination of durian and other fruits of both cultural and economic importance throughout Asia [18]. Additionally, this species has been identified as a carrier of orthoreoviruses, Lyssa virus, filoviruses, flavivirus, coronaviruses, and astroviruses [19\u201326]. The spread and abundance of this species make it an ideal subject for research purposes.",

The relatively higher number of protein-coding genes predicted in E. spelaea compared to P. alecto and R. aegyptiacus is likely due to a more homologous approach being used to predict the gene models of E. spelaea than that of P. alecto and R. aegyptiacus (see Methods section).

The large number of unique transcripts recovered through Iso-Seq enabled us to make a general assessment of transcriptional complexity of the bat genome. Of the 31,639 FL Iso-Seq transcripts, 382 RE transcripts (98 LTRs, 31 DNA elements, 7 satellites, 244 LINEs, 1 short interspersed nuclear element, and 1 unknown RE) were filtered out from further analysis using RepeatMasker (see Methods section). The remaining 31,257 clean transcripts were compared against our homology and ab initio predicted genes. Of the 20,640 coding genes, we observed 10,033 (5,925 are supported by clean Iso-Seq transcripts) single transcript genes and 10,607 (5,894 are supported by clean Iso-Seq transcripts) alternatively spliced genes. Overall, we found an isoform-to-gene ratio of 1.92 (39,526 transcripts per 20,640 genes) in E. spelaea, which is lower than 3.62 (167,430 transcripts per 46,298 genes) in human, but higher than 1.49 (33,093 transcripts per 22,264 genes) in P. alecto (Fig. 4A).

The E. spelaea genome assembly exemplifies the power of long-read sequencing technologies in rapid de novo assembly of a nonmodel genome and alternative-splicing isoform identification. Compared to the hybrid assembled R. aegyptiacus genome, the \u201cPacBio-only\u201d assembly was faster, more straightforward, and possessed higher contiguous N50 contigs and better repeat-resolving with a minimum difference (0.7%) in gene integrity. Thus, our study provides a high-quality reference genome for use in any future comparative studies. Even without scaffolding, these highly contiguous contigs and FL gene transcripts will be helpful to researchers to extract more accurate genomic loci information of their genes of interest, saving a great amount of energy, resources, and time. Our Iso-Seq results have increased our understanding of the complexity of the bat transcriptome and aided in alternative transcript identification. This complexity in the transcriptome of bats is still likely to be underestimated since Iso-Seq was performed at a relatively shallow depth (\u223c20x coverage) in this study. We would like to further highlight that this complexity is attributed by the type and number of alternative transcription events, as well as previously unannotated transcripts in bats. As more and more transcriptome data become available for E. spelaea, e.g., Illumina transcriptome sequencing of various tissues, this will aid in the identification of other alternative transcripts and continuously improve the annotation of the genome and the accuracy of protein coding sequences, as has been evident with the P. alecto genome since its first release. Taken together, we have provided a valuable resource, an E. spelaea genome and transcriptome database, for future comparative and functional studies, as well as demonstrated the advantages of employing the latest long-read sequencing technology in such studies of exotic species.",

Unique protein sequences from eight different mammals (B. taurus, Canis familiaris, E. caballus, H. sapiens, M. musculus, M. lucifugus, P. alecto, P. vampyrus; Supplementary Table S1) were downloaded from Ensembl (last accessed: 5/15/2017) [43] and used for homology-based prediction. The Maker2 pipeline was first run on the masked genome using the Iso-Seq transcriptome to infer gene predictions (est2genome  =  1), and training files for the ab initio gene predictors Augustus and SNAP were generated based on these results. Then, the annotation pipeline was run iteratively two additional times using the Iso-Seq transcriptome as evidence (est2genome  =  0) and providing new training files with each run. At this point, the protein-homology evidence was set to include all unique proteins in the eight different mammals. Next, Maker predict transcripts were merged with Iso-Seq transcripts and collapsed using pbtranscript-ToFU to include all the unique alternative spliced transcripts. Finally, low-quality genes shorter than 50 amino acids and/or exhibiting premature termination were removed to produce the final gene set.",

            "text": "Phylogenetic tree construction and divergence time estimation were performed as described in [4]. Briefly, Proteinortho software (v. 5.16b) [31] was used to identify the single-copy orthologous genes under default parameter setting. Using M. domestica as an outgroup, we identified 3,185 single-copy orthologous genes from E. spelaea and 11 other mammalian genomes (as described above). The coding sequence from each single-copy family was aligned by MUSCLE (v. 3.8.31) [44]. Four-fold degenerate sites were extracted from each gene alignment by an in-house Python script and concatenated to one super gene for each species. Then, RAxML (v. 8.2.11) [45] was applied to build phylogenetic trees for the concatenated sequences as described [4]. A total of 1,000 bootstrap replicates were employed to assess branch reliability in RAxML. Last, PAML (v. 4.9c) mcmctree [46] was used to determine split times based on the topology obtained in the RAxML analysis [4]. The gamma prior for the overall substitution rate was described by shape and scale parameters that were set as 1 and 11.1, respectively, calculated according to the substitution rate per time unit using PAML baseml [47]. Fossil calibrations were retrieved from the TimeTree database (last accessed 12/15/2017) [48]. Other parameters were set as default. The PAML mcmctree pipeline was run two independent times to confirm convergence and all acceptance proportions fall in the interval (20%, 40%).",
