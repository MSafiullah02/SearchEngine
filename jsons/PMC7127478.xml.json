            "text": "Natural killer (NK) cells represent a distinct subset of lymphoid cells that have innate immune functions [1]. Derived from the bone marrow, NK cells circulate in the blood and become activated by cytokines or upon encountering target cells that express ligands for NK cell receptors [2]. NK cell receptors are encoded in the germ-line and do not undergo somatic recombination like B- and T-cell antigen receptors; it is the balance of signals from activating and inhibitory receptors that determines the outcome of NK cell activity. Some inhibitory receptors recognize MHC class I, which is present on virtually all healthy cells, and prevent NK cell attack against these cells. Loss of MHC class I from cells owing to infection or transformation can lead to NK cell activation, as proposed by the \u2018missing self hypothesis\u2019 [3], provided that an activating receptor is engaged. These activating NK receptors bind to host-derived or pathogen-encoded ligands that are up-regulated on \u2018stressed\u2019 or infected cells. Upon activation, NK cells directly lyse target cells by exocytosis of perforin and granzymes and secrete cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, which mediate their immune response to infection. In this manner, NK cells function as important sentinels of the immune system, working as primary responders and alerting the host to the presence of infectious organisms.",

Several groups have recently examined the role of TLR9 and MyD88 in response to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection by using MyD88-deficient or TLR9-deficient mice. These immunodeficient mice had elevated amounts of virus in their spleens and livers compared with wild-type mice, which indicates an increased susceptibility to infection and suggests a crucial role for TLR9 and MyD88 in immunity to MCMV [4, 5, 6\u2022\u2022, 7\u2022\u2022]. Infection by MCMV activated IFN-producing cells and myeloid DCs, resulting in the production of IFN-\u03b1 and IL-12 through pathways dependent upon MyD88 and TLR9 [5]. Mice that lacked MyD88 or TLR9 had reduced amounts of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, interleukin (IL)-12, macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1) and IFN-\u03b3 in their sera [4, 5, 6\u2022\u2022]. Of note, NK cells from MCMV-infected TLR9- and MyD88-deficient mice produced less IFN-\u03b3 [4, 5], had impaired proliferation, and displayed reduced cytolytic activity compared with NK cells from MCMV-infected wild-type mice [5]. In addition, MCMV-infected CD11b+ DCs directly activated NK cell IFN-\u03b3 production by a mechanism that required IFN-\u03b1 and the NKG2D receptor on NK cells [6\u2022\u2022].",

In another report, it was found that sera levels of IFN-\u03b1 in TLR9-deficient mice were unchanged compared with wild-type mice, indicating that IFN-\u03b1 production in response to MCMV infection is independent of TLR9 [7\u2022\u2022].

Using mice deficient in perforin or IFN-\u03b3 and mice depleted of IFN-\u03b3 by antibody, organ-specific control of MCMV infection by NK cells was observed: perforin mediated viral clearance in the spleen and IFN-\u03b3 mediated protection in the liver [8]. A recent study re-evaluated the importance of these two effector mechanisms during MCMV infection and found that mice deficient in perforin or IFN-\u03b3 had elevated viral titers in the spleen and the liver three days post-infection compared with wild-type C57BL/6 mice [9]. By six days post-infection, viral titers in the spleens and livers of perforin-deficient mice remained higher than those of wild-type mice, whereas viral titers in IFN-\u03b3-deficient mice were higher only in the livers [9]. The authors noted that the differences observed between their work and the previous study might reflect the background of the mice used in the experiments, because MCMV resistance varies by mouse strain. The original study used perforin-deficient mice on a C57BL/6 \u00d7 129 mixed genetic background, whereas the recent study used mice on a C57BL/6 background. It is conceivable that NK cells in different mouse strains use distinct antiviral effector mechanisms in different organs.",

Recent experiments analyzing the NKG2D ligand MICA demonstrated that HCMV infection down-regulated a full-length isoform of MICA from the surface of infected fibroblasts, preventing lysis by the human NK cell line NKL [13]. However, a truncated form of MICA, which lacks a cytoplasmic tail owing to a frameshift mutation, was stably expressed on the surface of infected fibroblasts and was efficiently lysed by NKL [13]. Interestingly, the truncated allele was found to be the most common allele in several human populations [14], which suggests that polymorphism in the MICA gene might allow for enhanced viral clearance through NKG2D-dependent activation of NK cells. CD155, the ligand for the NK cell activating receptors DNAM-1 (CD226) and TACTILE (CD96), was targeted for down-regulation by the HCMV glycoprotein UL141, rendering infected cells resistant to NK cell lysis [15\u2022]. Down-regulation of CD155 only occurred during infection of fibroblasts with low-passage strains or clinical isolates of HCMV, and UL141 functioned by preventing maturation of CD155 and retaining it in the endoplasmic reticulum [15\u2022].",

Surprisingly, pp65 appeared to cause dissociation of NKp30 from its signaling component, CD3\u03b6, thereby inhibiting NKp30 activity [16]. The mechanism by which a virion tegument protein, such as pp65, might access the interaction site between NKp30 and CD3\u03b6 on the NK cell plasma membrane remains unclear and will require further investigation.",

A mutant virus that lacks the m157 open reading frame displayed enhanced virulence compared with wild-type MCMV in C57BL/6 mice, which indicates that recognition of m157 by Ly49H governs innate immune control of infection [18]. This idea was reinforced by the emergence of viral escape variants that have mutations in the m157 gene during infection of C57BL/6 mice that lack adaptive immunity [19, 20\u2022]. In this manner, Ly49H+ NK cells might drive the evolution of viruses that can escape from innate immune control.",

VLP immunization enhanced NK cell numbers in the lymph nodes and spleens, increased NK cell secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, and induced cytotoxic activity [34]. Depletion of NK cells from mice prior to treatment with VLPs resulted in decreased survival after infection with Ebola virus compared with undepleted mice, and adoptive transfer of NK cells activated by VLPs into na\u00efve mice enhanced their survival after Ebola infection, further implicating NK cells in immunity to Ebola virus [34]. Perforin, but not IFN-\u03b3, was shown to be required for the protective effect. Although not addressed in this report, the VLP-activated NK cells presumably augmented an adaptive immune response that was responsible for protection against challenge with Ebola virus.",

Transwell assay experiments revealed that NK cell IFN-\u03b3 production required contact of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with infected RBCs, and that NK cells produced IFN-\u03b3 only in the presence of PBMCs [39]. NK cells formed stable conjugates with infected RBCs [39], and in some cases reorganized the actin cytoskeleton after conjugate formation [37\u2022]. Purified NK cells, however, only produced substantial amounts of IFN-\u03b3 in the presence of monocytes [38\u2022]. In addition, IL-18 production by macrophages and MyD88 expression in both NK cells and macrophages were required to induce IFN-\u03b3 production by mouse NK cells in response to infected RBCs [38\u2022]. Although NK cells can interact with infected RBCs, robust NK cell activation seems to require secretion of soluble mediators by macrophages or monocytes. Specific NK receptors involved in recognition of infected RBCs have not been defined; however, in humans, KIR molecules might play a role, because associations were found between the KIR genotype and donor susceptibility to malaria [39].",

In particular, a role for NK cells in host defense against CMV in humans and mice is supported by the existence of viral mutation in response to NK cell-mediated immunity and the evolution of viral proteins that target the NKG2D ligands in CMV-infected cells. Although less well-studied, a developing theme is anti-parasitic and anti-bacterial immunity resulting from the interplay of NK cells with DCs and macrophages. However, NK cells might not always be beneficial in immune responses, as highlighted by recent observations that NK cells might promote the growth of rather than protect against LM. The future promises a better molecular definition of the mechanisms by which NK cells participate in innate immunity against these pathogens.",
