One patient was discharged within 14 days after treatment. Another patient was discharged 25 days after treatment, and his TR-PCR test was still positive on the 15th day. We found that there may be virus carriers in asymptomatic population with epidemiological contact history. After 14 days of isolation, asymptomatic infection may still carry the virus, which means the risk of transmission and present a new challenge to home isolation. Most close contacts are still subject to home isolation, especially in Wuhan, the center of the epidemic. Isolation at home is mainly suitable for people who are healthy in the past, have no history of basic diseases and have no symptoms or mild symptoms at present [4] . Considering the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, it is recommended to home isolation for 14 days. Are those who do not experience symptoms during 14 days of isolation period necessarily safe? Of the 78 laboratory-confirmed patients collected from multiple centers, We found two asymptomatic infections. February 21, the 25st day of isolation, his RT-PCR test turned negative for the second time and he was discharged (Figure) . There were no symptoms during the treatment.",
