            "text": "Assessment of acid\u2013base status is frequently used in veterinary critical care cases, because it can be used to detect early physiological derangements, alerting clinicians to the possibility of decompensation, as well as providing treatment directives (Hopper, 2012). Traditionally, the Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch (HH) technique has been used, when assessing plasma acid\u2013base disturbances, which involves measuring two variables, namely carbon dioxide tension (pCO2) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) concentration (Constable, 2000). A change in either of these will invoke a compensatory response in the other, to maintain a constant plasma pH (Constable, 2000). The reciprocity of this relationship may obfuscate interpretation of a mixed or non-compensated disorder, where it is unclear to what extent pCO2 and HCO3- have changed due to the primary disorder, or due to compensatory mechanisms (Constable, 2000, Sirker et al., 2002). Calculations based on the standard base excess (titratable acidity or alkalinity) and the anion gap have been used in conjunction with the HH model, in an attempt to abrogate this problem (Siggaard-Andersen et al., 1960, Siggaard-Andersen and Fogh-Andersen, 1995).",

The fundamental premise of the SIM is that the strong ion difference (SID) of plasma (difference between the sum of all strong cations and strong anions) is the most important determinant of the hydrogen ion activity in a system. In addition to pCO2 and SID, the SIM considers a third variable, namely the sum of weak non-volatile organic acids, such as albumin and phosphate (denoted Atot) (Fencl and Leith, 1993, Kellum, 2007). The SIM therefore provides rational explanations for acid\u2013base disturbances that are not well understood in terms of the HH model, such as the effects of free water and plasma proteins (Kellum, 2008).",

Sodium was consistently low in the CPV group, indicating a relative free water excess. According to the SIM principles, a free water excess will invoke acidosis, partly due to a decrease in the strong ion difference (SID) (Kellum, 2007). In addition, an Atot alkalosis may occur with a free water excess, due to decreased plasma protein concentration, which may offset the magnitude of SID acidosis, as is the case in dilutional acidosis (Constable, 2003). In the case of CPV enteritis, this mechanism could be even more complex, due to dehydration and concurrent protein loss through the gut, resulting in diverse outcomes in the plasma protein concentration and therefore the contribution of Atot. Conversely, a free water deficit would result in an increased SID alkalosis with a possible Atot acidosis, due to increased concentration of plasma proteins (Constable, 2003).

This finding confirms the assertion that plasma globulin proteins play a more significant role in the determination of Atot in dogs compared to humans (Constable and Stampfli, 2005). Therefore, the base excess algorithm using albumin, overestimated the contribution of Atot in CPV enteritis. Many of the control dogs had significant Atot alkalosis, according to the base excess algorithm, although when the Atot was estimated using TP, the value was close to the normal value previously calculated (15.8 mEq/L) in the control dogs.",

Notwithstanding this constraint, valuable information can still be obtained from this study, regarding the pathophysiology of the acid\u2013base disturbances present in dogs affected with CPV enteritis. A previous study showed a marked increase in l-lactate production, a significantly decreased base excess, with only a mild decrease in bicarbonate and significantly reduced carbon dioxide tension (Nappert et al., 2002). Bicarbonate values roughly approximated to those expected during compensation with a primary respiratory alkalosis, in the face of significantly increased l-lactate and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, which would be expected to result in a metabolic acidosis. These findings, compared with those of the present study, suggest the HH paradigm is too simplistic to explain the complex underlying metabolic acid\u2013base changes in CPV enteritis.",

This was an interesting finding, since it would have been expected that a significant relationship would have been observed between the sum and free water changes, although this was not the case. Interestingly, the two most consistently deranged variables, namely sodium and albumin, showed the least significant relationship with the sum. This finding appears to emphasise the significance of chloride disturbances in the pathogenesis of acid\u2013base changes in CPV enteritis, which is not appreciated by the HH model. Therefore, regardless of a consistent hyponatraemic acidosis and hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis, the direction and magnitude of the changes in chloride will likely determine the outcome of the sum, in most cases. The importance of chloride changes was further highlighted, since it was the only variable in which differences were observed, according to clinical severity. The more severely-affected puppies, according to clinical score, tended to have a hypochloraemic alkalosis, whereas mildly-affected individuals tended to have a hyperchloraemic acidosis. These changes might reflect differences in the severity of vomiting or the period of illness that had elapsed, before sampling. Further studies are needed to determine if chloride changes correlate with outcome and whether therapeutic chloride correction is warranted.",

When SID and Atot were calculated and compared to experimentally-established values, there was good agreement between the two models. This method, therefore, compared well with the base excess algorithm approach in reaching a diagnosis of strong ion and Atot changes. The base excess algorithm was principally employed, due to its common use in determining acid\u2013base status. Our results showed that the model was robust and that it compared well with data obtained using a model validated in dogs. Clinicians should recognise that in dogs the base excess algorithm using albumin rather that TP might overestimate the magnitude of Atot changes.",
