In fact, upon further reanalysis of the schizophrenia-associated variation [42], Basak et al. found SNPs in the second intron of the BCL11A gene with significance of association with schizophrenia just missing the genome-wide cut-off at p = 1.52e\u221207 [46]. The activity of enhancer elements Enh5\u2013Enh8 are correlated with the expression of VRK2, potentially through short-range regulatory effects, but the dynamic range of the VRK2\u2032s response to enhancer activity is small (shown as the change in median expression values between grey and purple distributions in Fig. 3a). However, similar to the example of the obesity linked discussed above [17], there is also a strong positive correlation of elements Enh5\u2013Enh8 with BCL11A transcription (despite a 2.5 Mb separation between the gene and the regulatory elements). Due to the extreme distance between this enhancer cluster and the promoter of the BCL11A gene, this connection will be missed by any of the methods relying on a fixed genomic cut-off for the enhancer\u2013promoter interactions, even in the most generous case presented in the recent schizophrenia TWAS [23, 24] (max. distance of 500 kb), 2 Mb distance by Huo et al. [26] and in a zebrafish phenotype atlas [25]. In fact, both TWAS analyses reported FANCL as a significant hit, but failed to further corroborate the link between this locus and the FANCL by the Hi-C data [23], nor the gene list analysis [24].",

However, both of these genes are ubiquitously expressed across tissues, and have a rather large baseline transcriptional activity: these are hallmarks of GRB bystander genes, which are not dependent on activation via long-range enhancers [16]. Moreover, the association of another variant in the VRK2 promoter region, rs2312147, with white matter volume in healthy subjects [45], and white matter connectivity in schizophrenia patients [47] implicates this locus in aberrant brain development. Given BCL11A\u2019s role in the regulation of neuronal migration in the developing cortex, and in agreement with the neural network hypothesis of schizophrenia aetiology [38], we conclude that the evidence points to BCL11A activation by this enhancer as the most likely biological mechanisms responsible for the GWAS hits at this locus.",

This GRB spans the ZEB2, GTDC1, ARHGAP15 and KYNU genes, with ARHGAP15 and ZEB2 being the predicted targets of long-range regulation (Fig. 3b). The expression of both predicted GRB target genes is significantly correlated with the activity of the enhancer overlapping this insertion. KYNU expression, which is not found to be responsive to long-range regulation in this locus, is also significantly correlated with the activity of the enhancer.

The PGC study proposes IGSF9B as the putative target of the rs75059851 SNP identified in the original study due to the location of the SNP in the promoter/first intron of two transcript isoforms of the IGSF9B. The expression of all three of the predicted GRB target genes is significantly greater in tissues in which the enhancers are active, Fig. 2c. In this case all three predicted target genes are neuronal specific cell adhesion molecules involved in neuronal development and thus likely candidate genes. Indeed, OPCML has been previously implicated in the development of schizophrenia by multiple studies in European [56] and Thai [57] populations. In addition, increased levels of an NTM isoform have recently been detected in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia patients [58]. More importantly, the concordance of putative enhancers in both schizophrenia-associated loci with genes across the entire GRB (Fig. 3c), including SNX19, supports the idea that variants rs10791097 (found just downstream of, and originally thought to be a bystander locus to SNX19 [42]) and rs75059851 share some mechanistic aspects in the aetiology of the disease, and calls for testing for effects of their interaction despite the large genomic distance between them. This example highlights how the GRBs can serve as functional units in which the effects of multiple SNPs can be considered as potentially interacting.",

This locus overlaps a GRB containing both DRD2 and a neural cell adhesion molecule gene, NCAM1, shown in Fig. 3d. NCAM1 has previously been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia [61], and our analysis identifies NCAM1 as another plausible target, despite not being categorized as a GRB target (it\u2019s predictive value is just below the threshold, see Supplementary information). When active, the predicted enhancer element in the schizophrenia-associated locus affects transcription of both DRD2 and NCAM1, with a more prominent effect on the transcription of the NCAM1 gene (Supplementary Fig. 1). This locus illustrates the risk of hypothesis-driven target gene search: once a gene, e.g. DRD2, expected to play a role in disease aetiology is identified, other putative targets in its vicinity may be overlooked.",

The GRB model allows for the expansion of the search for a target beyond adjacent genes and provides boundaries as to which genes should be included and which should not, but only in the cases where GWAS loci occur in the region of the genome implicated in the long-range regulation. Further, automated GRB target gene prediction provides a shortlist of genes most likely to be under the control of long-range regulation.",

The evolutionary nature of the GRB model allows for an unbiased approach to identification of potential target genes, potentially identifying novel target genes and new disease mechanisms. Of particular interest is a network of mutually interacting transcription factors involved in neuronal development of cortical layers, predicted as targets in SCZ-GRBs: BCL11B, BCL11A, TBR1, SATB2 and FEZF2 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Of these, only BCL11B is listed among targets in the PGC study with remainder not detected based on the assignment of non-coding SNPs to the closest gene. GRBs often target genes involved in development, which require complex regulation [16]. Our finding that the non-coding genetic loci associated with schizophrenia and autism, but not bipolar disorder, are significantly more likely to occur in GRBs is thus consistent with other evidence that there is a stronger neurodevelopmental component to these disorders than bipolar [64, 65], and indicates novel potential developmental genes linked to these disorders.",

The most significant change in these is a notable trend towards functional characterisation of SNPs in view of finding regulatory variants using eQTL information [8, 24, 26, 66], chromatin contacts [8, 27] and transcription factor binding profiles [26]. We have analysed the three largest datasets [8, 26, 67] in the same way as the PGC GWAS represented here (Supplementary Fig. S3), and showed that the GRB target gene prediction still implicates many novel long-range contacts not documented in even the most recent published data (Supplementary information and Supplementary Tables S2 andS3). While a greater coverage of high-resolution tissue-specific chromatin contacts, allele-specific gene expression, transcriptome maps and genome-wide binding profiles for a wider range of transcription factors will partially close this gap in the future, the GRB approach will stand as an elegant method of shortlisting (or adding additional evidence for) genes through which regulatory non-coding variants exert their effects on disease emergence.",

This has led to large numbers of novel loci being identified, but raises a new challenge: determining the correct gene(s) linked to these loci. The common practice of assigning non-coding loci identified in GWAS to the nearest is likely to be an oversimplification in a substantial proportion of cases. In particular, it neglects the topological organisation of the genome, and the possibility that a locus may be in, or linked to, a non-coding element that regulates a distant gene. New understanding on the characteristics of non-coding elements in highly conserved GRBs, and their link to TADs can be used to identify the potential target genes for loci in GRBs. We applied this knowledge to the loci from recent GWAS in three neuropsychiatric disorders, to show that for two of them, schizophrenia and autism, there was an excess of loci located in GRBs than would be expected by chance. Further analysis showed the potential of this approach to identify novel plausible genes for the schizophrenia, such as NTM, ARHGAP15 and ZEB2. This illustrates the potential value of the GRB approach and the need to consider the role of non-coding elements to guide the biological analysis of loci identified by GWAS.",
