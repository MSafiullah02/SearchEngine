This suggests that using spatially explicit networks as boundary conditions for epidemiological models may yield more accurate depictions of transmission than would be obtained from using administrative divisions like counties or census tracts. The results show an abrupt transition from slow increases in confirmed cases in a small number of network components to rapid geographic dispersion to a larger number of components before mobility reductions occurred in March 2020.",

The degree of clustering changes somewhat with time and day, but generally remains within a relatively constrained extent of developed (anthropogenically modified) land area. Census enumerations indicate that the vast majority of Earth's habitable land area is very sparsely populated, and that the majority of the human population occupies only a small percentage of this area (Fig. 1) . The frequently cited statistic that half of the world's population is now urban [United_Nations, 2018] suggests that the degree of clustering continues to increase as the largest mass migration in human history proceeds.

Densely populated, brightly lit urban cores are surrounded by less densely populated, less brightly lit urban peripheries. In some areas isolated settlements are surrounded by undeveloped land (e.g. Siberian steppe, Amazon basin, Sahara desert). In other areas settlements are embedded within a mosaic of low intensity land use often consisting of interspersed agricultural and undeveloped land. In intensive agricultural regions urban centers of different sizes can be distributed within a background of spatially contiguous agriculture. Hence, urban cores, by definition, tend to be spatially isolated while urban peripheries are more interconnected and the least developed or populated areas provide the greatest extent of spatial connectivity. The spatial structure and connectivity of population and development are clearly relevant to disease transmission, but the choropleth maps typically used to represent population and development introduce distortions unrelated to the actual distribution of people and settlements. Specifically, administrative fragmentation of spatially contiguous networks of population and development results from the use of functionally arbitrary administrative boundaries. The problem is compounded by varying definitions for different elements of the hierarchy of human settlements (e.g. [Deuskar, 2015] ).",

The resulting distribution of network component areas and populations provides a fundamental constraint on disease transmission through the network. We characterize the scaling properties of suites of spatial networks of population and development corresponding to different degrees of connectivity. After characterizing the population and development network distributions, we project county level numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 onto a more spatially detailed network of development to quantify the spatiotemporal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 detection throughout the US in early 2020. Growth of the resulting spatial network of confirmed cases within the host network is quantified in terms of number, area and host population of infected components for comparison with three metrics for mobility in March 2020 when the number of confirmed cases was increasing most rapidly.",

Patterns of movement determine interaction networks through which pathogens are transmitted, from influenza [Balcan et al., 2009] to dengue [Reiner et al., 2014] . Host movement and connectivity of host populations not only influence the size and duration of local epidemics, but can also influence the extent to which transmission occurs beyond local scales, leading to larger regional epidemics [Chen et al., 2018] . While such movement patterns and connectivity may be less influential to the dynamics of environmentally meditated infectious diseases-diseases with environmental reservoirs such as vectors or non-human hosts-they are critical to directly transmitted pathogens like influenza [Balcan et al., 2009] and SARS-CoV-2 [Boulos and Geraghty, 2020] .

However, such census data or transportation networks are often derived from aggregate data sources, for example at the scale of administrative units like US counties or large metropolitan areas, and thus may not be representative of local scale movement and connectivity of human populations. When considering the current epidemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in the face of 'shelter-in-place' measures being taken across the globe and massive reductions in regional vehicle and air travel, such approaches are likely to be inadequate in identifying and predicting regional spread of COVID-19. Moreover, for many infectious diseases that occur in developing countries where human movement and interaction networks may be much more localized, finer scale information about population movement and connectivity patterns is imperative for improved epidemiological modeling of transmission across a diversity of geographies.",

City size distributions, defined on the basis of population, are often described as power laws. Auerbach [Auerbach, 1913] appears to have made the initial observation that the product of a city population and its ordinal rank is approximately constant. Lotka [Lotka, 1941] subsequently observed a hyperbolic rank-size relationship for U.S. city populations in 1920 and that the slope of the Log 10 rank-size plot was not exactly -1 but -0.93 and that some of the larger cities were smaller than predicted. Zipf later noted that the exponent of the power law is also close to -1 for U.S. cities [Zipf, 1942] as well as for the frequency of usage of words, sizes of firms and a variety of other socioeconomic characteristics [Zipf, 1949] . He postulated a universal principal of least effort in which the power law emerges as an optimal distribution for a variety of processes. The special case of a power law distribution with an exponent of -1 is often referred to as Zipf's Law and has been tested repeatedly for cities with mixed results [Gabaix et al., 2004; Nitsch, 2005; Pumain, 2004; Soo, 2005] . While the consistency of Zipf's Law has driven sustained interest for several decades, and been the basis for a multitude of models [Berry and Garrison, 1958; Gabaix, 1999; Lotka, 1941; Pumain, 2006] , the varying degree and extent of agreement with observation seem to preclude consensus on either the universality of the law [Gan et al., 2006; Soo, 2005] or its underlying cause [Batty, 2006a; Lotka, 1941; Pumain, 2004; 2006] . The assertion of a universal power law for city size is controversial because the linearity and slope of the power law rank-size distribution appears to vary through time and among countries [Gabaix et al., 2004; Nitsch, 2005; Pumain and Moriconi-Ebrard, 1997; Soo, 2005] .",

            "text": "To some extent, the apparent inconsistency of Zipf's Law may be a result of the data and methods used to derive the parameters of the distribution. Analyses of city size distributions almost always use population counts based on census enumerations. Likewise, almost all analyses have considered city size distributions within countries or compared distributions among countries. Country-to-country differences in census collection methods and scale of administrative units make it difficult to combine data from different countries. Continent and global distributions of city size can be well fit by power laws in the upper tail but the largest cities are usually considerably smaller than predicted and the slope is generally significantly less than -1 [Decker et al., 2007; Nitsch, 2005; Pumain, 2004; Soo, 2005] . This differs from country-specific analyses in which urban primacy sometimes results in the largest \"king cities\" being larger than predicted by the power law [Jefferson, 1939; Pumain, 2004] . A more pervasive complication arises in the common disparity between the functional and administrative extents of most large cities and urban agglomerations. Spatially contiguous agglomerations are generally composed of numerous smaller municipalities so a large city or agglomeration is represented not as a single entity but as number of smaller populations associated with the administrative subdivisions. For this reason, most analyses are effectively aspatial -although the function and structure of the agglomeration are clearly influenced by the aggregate spatial distribution of the population and its activities. While some studies have recognized this problem and attempted to accommodate spatial agglomerations [Moriconi-Ebrard, 1993; Pumain and Moriconi-Ebrard, 1997; Rozenfeld et al., 2008] , the lack of a consistent, widely accepted definition of urban extent still makes it difficult to test the universality of Zipf's Law at continental to global scales. The observation that spatial scaling of night light networks yields more consistent results than administratively defined population distributions at continent to global scales [Small et al., 2011] suggests that Zipf's Law may actually be driven more by spatial network structure rather than socioeconomic factors.",

This allows us to characterize the sensitivity of the network structure to the defining criterion -and quantify the effect of different degrees of spatial connectivity on the network. By varying the lower threshold of population density (or luminance) that is part of the network, we vary the connectivity of the network. Lower thresholds allow for larger more interconnected networks with greater numbers of components (spatially connected clusters of pixels -analogous to connected nodes). We calculate the size distribution of spatially contiguous patches (segments) above each threshold by segmenting the quantity (density or brightness) on the basis of spatial connectivity of each 0.25 km 2 equal area pixel to its 8 adjacent neighbors (Queen's case adjacency). We then calculate the area of each distinct contiguous segment and tabulate the size distribution for all segments (spatially contiguous patches) 9 pixels (1.5x1.5=2.25 km 2 ) or larger.

We impose three thresholds on the distributions of population density and luminance (Fig. 4) . For each threshold, we calculate the area and population within each component and produce ranksize distributions of component size and population. An additional low density threshold is applied to the population grid to illustrate the effect of explosive percolation that occurs as a result of the census block size distribution. With both distributions, the upper threshold admits only the upper shoulder containing the brightest (densest) pixels corresponding to urban cores. Progressively lower thresholds are added until the background luminance (or aggregate density) is reached, at which point the ability of the data to represent the extent of development (residential population) becomes questionable.

We use more statistically sound estimates of the power law exponent and optimal rank-size cutoff, derived using the MLE and semi-parametric bootstrap approach given by Clauset and colleagues [Clauset et al., 2009] .",

The full resolution comparisons in Figure 5b illustrate the greater detail resolved by the night light which extends the lower threshold network into periurban peripheries where larger census blocks do not resolve smaller individual settlements. The inset map on Figure 5a shows the effect of an additional lower threshold on the population density network. As the threshold approaches the mode of the density distribution, greater numbers of larger, lower density census blocks exceed the threshold and interconnect many of the larger components in the eastern US to form a single Giant Component encompassing a much larger area than any of the others. This is a result of the underlying census block size distribution, rather than a characteristic of the actual population density. The result is analogous to the process of explosive percolation, which is commonly observed with critical phenomena (e.g. [D'Souza et al., 2019] ).",

The intersection reflects the spatial distribution of development within each county, thereby showing specific areas where people are more likely to be. Adding the Log 10 (cases) to Log 10 (population) at grid resolution highlights higher density areas with larger numbers of cases.

However, the situation (at time of writing) with respect to confirmed case count and testing frequency (and accuracy) may be representative of a phenomenon which could occur in any scenario involving the dispersion of an entity within a spatial network. Specifically, this phenomenon is the uncertainty in attributing observations to either the propagation of the entity itself (in this case, the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen) or the propagation of the detection effort (in this case, the asynchronous, heterogeneous, and variable accuracy and availability of antigen testing throughout the US. In the general case, geospatial observations of propagation within a network can be conceptualized as a spatiotemporal convolution of two functions representing 1) propagation of the entity and 2) propagation of detection efforts. Endmember scenarios can be easily envisioned. In some cases, comprehensive detection efforts may exist prior to the beginning of transmission, and all detections could accurately represent the propagation of the entity. In the other extreme, the entity may have fully spread prior to implementation of detection efforts so observations could represent changes in detection. As the endmember scenarios are not mutually exclusive, simultaneous propagation of transmission and detection may be the most general case. In the particular case of the early propagation of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the US, we cannot speculate further until more information becomes available.",
