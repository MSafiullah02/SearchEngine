The researchers looked at whether lethal mutations in non\u2010structural (NS) HCV genes could be rescued by trans\u2010complementation 1. A series of replicon RNAs carrying mutations (in the NS3, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B regions) that abolished replication were transfected into Huh\u20107 hepatoma cells harbouring autonomous replicating HCV helper RNAs. In this context, only NS5A mutations in the low complexity sequence I (LCS I) domain have been efficiently rescued (Table 1). The required proteins for complementation were NS3\u2010NS5A, whereas NS5A expressed alone did not restore RNA replication. These findings strongly suggested that other NS HCV proteins specifically act in cis on HCV RNA and, indeed, the hypothesis was confirmed in 2006 by Tong and Malcom 16. Nevertheless, trans\u2010acting function of NS5A likely would require protein hyperphosphorylation 17.",

Conversely, the lack of core expression in replicating JFH1 cells (JFH1dC) was associated with a diffuse distribution of NS proteins on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the absence of concentration around the LDs. Moreover, LD levels were lower in JFH1dC replicating cells than in wt JFH1 replicating cells. Interestingly, NS proteins again accumulated around LDs when JFH1dC replicating cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing wt Core.
