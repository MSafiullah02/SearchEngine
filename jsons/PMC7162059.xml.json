The lungs become overinflated and the resting end\u2010expiratory lung volume (functional residual capacity) is approximately twice normal [\n4]. As a result the diaphragm is depressed and flattened. In this position it functions least efficiently. Dynamic compliance is decreased, in part because the infant is breathing at a higher lung volume and hence on a stiffer portion of the volume\u2010pressure curve of the lung, and in part because of the uneven distribution of resistances within the lung. The airway obstruction impairs gas exchange with hypoxia and hypercapnia as a result of ventilation perfusion mismatch. Fatigue of the respiratory muscles may be heralded by irregular breathing and can proceed very rapidly [\n1,\n9]. These changes are very similar to that in asthma.",

A study of adults challenged multiple times with RSV highlights the difficulty in inducing protective immunity [\n55]. Seven of 15 adults challenged with an unattenuated group A virus 2 months after a natural group A infection became infected and shed virus with a pattern similar to natural infection, and five (85% of those infected) developed upper respiratory tract symptoms. With subsequent challenges, fewer (25\u201330%) became infected and shed virus for shorter times. Each infection appeared to provide some additional protection, but still about 50% of those infected after each challenge were symptomatic [\n55].

In the adult volunteer study [\n55], antibodies to the F protein and the homologous G protein and neutralizing antibodies correlated with protection from reinfection, but even at the highest levels of antibodies 25% of subjects could be reinfected.

Another recent report provided additional support for the role of the TH2 cell response in enhanced disease [\n88], which showed that a combination of anti\u2010IL\u20104 and \u201010 antibodies, but not individual antibodies, eliminated the enhanced pulmonary pathology ususally seen in BALB/c mice. On the other hand, the similarities in the clinical manifestations between RSV bronchiolitis and allergic asthma and the fact that T cells from asthmatic patients stimulated by allergic antigens have a TH2 phenotype make TH2 cells attractive as contributors to the pathogenesis of RSV bronchiolitis [\n6].",

IL\u20104 has also been shown to be obligatory for class switching to IgE production by activated B lymphocytes in humans [\n99,\n100]. while IFN\u03b3 inhibits this effect of IL\u20104 [\n101]. Anti\u2010IL\u20104 inhibits IgE production in a murine model of atopic asthma [\n102], and IL\u20104 inhibits the secretion of IFN\u03b3 at the transcriptional level [\n103]. In addition to its role in supporting IgE synthesis, IL\u20104 has been demonstrated to be essential in the commitment of naive CD4 T cells to the TH2 phenotype in vitro [\n91,\n104], a function supported in vivo by the effect of anti\u2010IL\u20104 antibody in inhibiting the development of TH2 cells [\n105,\n106].

More recently, it is reported that individuals with either atopic or non\u2010atopic asthma show infiltration of the mucosa with cells expressing TH2 type cytokines (IL\u20104 and IL\u20105), providing further evidence for similarities in the immunopathogenesis of these clinically distinct forms of asthma [\n93,\n94].",

The fetus then is born with a tendency for TH2 responses. It is believed that early infant infection, particularly bacterial, induces a switch from a substantially TH2 response to TH1, and a recent study showed that RSV\u2010primed lymph node cell (LNC) response consists of T helper cells which are predominantly of the TH2 subset, secreting IL\u20104 [\n120]. These data suggest that RSV infection may perpetuate a \u2018fetal\u2019 TH2 response, entraining an allergic diathesis in infants in response to infection. If such speculation is correct, then primary prevention of asthma would require immune modulation of early infant infection, such as RSV, which promotes a predominantly TH2 response [\n121].",
