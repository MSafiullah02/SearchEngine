Massive concentrations of these organisms appear on the surface of the ocean, causing high mortality of the fish by asphyxia. Also large concentration of this algae in the sea give the water a brown to red coloration because of their pigmentation (Trease and Evanes, 1996). Certain dinoflagellate species produce toxin which when consumed by filter feeders, such as shellfish, are concentrated in the flesh of the animals. Consumption of contaminated shellfish by man can result in severe health problems including death. The toxins are usually classified into paralytic shellfish poisons or diarrhetic shellfish poisons. Despite of the toxicity of some species of dinoflagelates, some other species produced unique compounds not separated from other phyla most of them showed a very potent biological activity. Dinoflagelates lies taxonomically between prokaryotics and eukaryotics and sometimes called mesokaryotes (Dodge, 1965). This unique situation makes the organism very interesting to secondary metabolite production (Dodge, 1965).",

The fish immediately senses the toxins and attempts to jump out of the aquarium. This behavior is followed by erratic response to external stimuli, apparently difficulty in obtaining oxygen, loss of equilibrium, narcosis and eventually death. The toxic symptoms were then proved to be due to stypoldione isolated from S. zonale (Gerwick et al., 1979). Stypoquinonic acid 135 was isolated from the lipophilic extract of the same alga (Wessels et al., 1999) and showed inhibition of tyrosine kinase p56lck enzyme.

The NCI Decision Network Committee selected halmon as a pre-clinical drug for development (Fuller et al., 1992, 1994). Ten halogenated monoterpenes 205\u2013214 related to the novel antitumor compound halomon 204 or to the carbocyclic analog (Fuller et al., 1992) have been isolated from different geographic collections of the red alga. These compounds were comparatively evaluated alongside compounds 204 and 210 in the US National Cancer Institute\u2019s in vitro human cancer cell line screening panel. The results insights into structure/activity relationships in this series as follows: Compounds 204\u2013207 exhibited similar cytotoxicity to that reported earlier for 204 (Fuller et al., 1992). These results suggested that halogen at C7 was not essential to the activity. In contrast, compound 211 was relatively weekly cytotoxic and the minimally differential activity showed no significant correlation to that of 204, indicating that a halogen at C6 was essential for the characteristic activity of 204\u2013207. halogen at C2 was required for halomone like activity. Carbocyclic compounds like 208 and 215 were considerably less cytotoxic than 204\u2013207. Compound 209 was more comparable to the overall (panel-averaged) potency to halomon. However, there was little differential response of the cell lines, and consequently no significant correlation to the profile of 204.",

Isolation of these peptides was assisted by bioassay-guided fractionation using a brine shrimp toxicity assay. trans, trans-ceratospongamide exhibits potent inhibition to sPLA2 expression in a cell-based model for antiinflammation (ED50 32 nM), whereas the cis, cis isomer is inactive. trans, trans-ceratospongamide was also shown to inhibit the expression of a human-sPLA2 (secreted phospholipase A2) promotor-based reporter by 90%. The degree of anti-inflammatory activity of compounds 311 and 312 was measured as the inhibition of secreted phospholipase A2 by hepatocellular carcinoma cells stimulated with 1L-1\u03b2. The tans, trans form is a potent inhibitor of sPLA2 expression with EDso 32 \u03bcM. Both compounds showed only moderate potency in the brine shrimp toxicity assay.",
