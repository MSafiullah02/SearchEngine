For the group 2 coronaviruses such as MHV, as well as for SARS-CoV, at least 16 mature nsps are processed co-and post-translationally from the gene 1 polyprotein by two or three proteinases expressed as part of the polyprotein. 1, 2 The intermediate and mature nsps are thought to be essential for replication. These include demonstrated or predicted functions such as RNA polymerase and RNA helicase (nsp12 and nsp13), as well as recently predicted functions in RNA synthesis, modification, or processing such as ADP ribosylation, exonuclease, endoribonuclease, and RNA methyltransferase (nsp3, nsp14, nsp15, and nsp16, respectively). Finally, there are several nsps with no demonstrated or predicted functions, such as nsp1 and nsp2. To test the requirements for nsp1 and nsp14 in replication and to probe their functions, deletions or mutations were engineered into the viral genome in nsp1 and nsp14 and mutant viruses were analyzed for virus viability, replication, protein expression, and RNA synthesis. The results demonstrate that deletions and substitutions in nsp1 are tolerated in viable mutants, including deletion of the carboxy-terminal half of nsp1. Nsp14 appears to be essential for replication in culture but can tolerate substitution of tyrosine 414, as well as deletion of flanking cleavage sites.

Both cleavage site deletions resulted in syncytia in electroporated cells and recovery of infectious virus from the supernatant media. While both cleavage site deletion mutants were impaired in extent of CPE and virus growth, they differed in the degree of replication impairment. Specifically, the VUSS17 mutant had a slight delay in growth but attained wild-type peak titers, while the VUSS6 mutant showed delays of more than 4 h in peak titer during high MOI infection (5 pfu/cell) and never attained wild-type peak titers. The result suggests that incomplete processing of nsp14 from the flanking proteins alters the replication efficiency of the viruses.
