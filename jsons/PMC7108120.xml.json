The following were considered evidence of pneumococcal infection: S. pneumoniae cultured from a sterile site or from a lower respiratory tract specimen (ie, not a nasopharyngeal specimen), including recovery after mouse intraperitoneal inoculation; pneumococcal antigen detection in urine; and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of pleural fluid. Studies that focused on a specific population (eg, the elderly or immunocompromised) were excluded. See Supplementary Material for details. We identified 31 studies (21120 patients) from the United States and Canada published between 1917 and 2015 and 37 studies (21166 patients) from Europe.

Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus were identified in the remaining cases; in fewer than 5%, no bacterial cause could be found. In the preantibiotic era, no antibiotic would have interfered with a bacteriologic diagnosis, and, compared to current practice, clinicians made greater efforts to obtain sputum samples for culture. Of course, pneumonia due to influenza virus had been recognized for quite some time [75]. Modern studies of patients who died in the 1918 influenza epidemic suggest that most of those deaths were, in fact, associated with secondary bacterial infection [76]. Outbreaks of pneumonia, thought to be viral and later identified as adenoviral [77], occurred in young adults, especially in military settings where crowding and physical and mental exhaustion were prevalent.",

Recognized cases, documented by culture, nearly always occurred in children, teenagers, and young adults (eg, military recruits [80]). Older adults were largely unaffected [83, 84], an observation that later came to be overlooked when diagnosis began to rely on serologic techniques. As a result, Mycoplasma pneumonia came to be greatly overdiagnosed. During World War II, an Armed Forces Commission, established to investigate outbreaks of pneumonia in military forces, identified the following 4 kinds of pneumonia: pneumococcal, mycoplasmal, influenzal, and acute respiratory disease of recruits, later shown to be adenoviral [85]. Nevertheless, pneumococcus was still regarded as the principal cause. In fact, through its 12th (1967) edition, the Cecil-Loeb Textbook of Medicine covered the subject of pneumonia under the rubric \u201cBacterial diseases: pneumococcal pneumonia\u201d [86]. Although other causes were cited, \u201cpneumococcal pneumonia \u2026 [remained] the most important of all pneumonias, not only in numerical terms, but because \u2026 [it was] the prototype of all the bacterial pneumonias\u201d [86].",

Nearly one-third of pneumococcal diagnoses were made serologically by rises in antibody to various pneumococcal constituents or by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) to detect capsular polysaccharides in sputum. However, these serologic tests have not been validated, and CIE is regularly positive in sputum that does not contain pneumococci (D. Musher and C. Stager, unpublished). If these serologic results are excluded, pneumococcus was found in 34% of cases. Diagnoses of Chlamydia and Mycoplasma were only made serologically. Interestingly, an earlier study by these same investigators [124] in which no special serologic techniques were used identified an etiologic agent in 54% of cases, with pneumococcus in 30%, Haemophilus in 8%, and \u201catypical organisms\u201d in 1%.

We attempted to minimize the latter 2 factors by including only studies that performed pneumococcal testing in a significant proportion of cases. For studies that provided sufficiently granular data, we calculated the frequency of pneumococcal pneumonia by limiting the denominator to only those patients who underwent such testing. Also, we chose a case definition of pneumococcal pneumonia that emphasizes validated microbiologic tests that have been in clinical practice for decades. While an in-depth qualitative analysis is beyond the scope of this article, we provide preliminary evidence to suggest differences between the United States/Canada and Europe with respect to the relative frequency of pneumococcus as a cause of pneumonia.",

In Europe and other parts of the world where pneumococcal vaccines have been recommended for routine use for adults and where the incidence of cigarette smoking remains high, pneumococcus remains responsible for a higher proportion of cases of CAP (Figure 1B) [40, 123, 126, 129\u2013131]. Reliance on serologic techniques has probably led to overdiagnosis of Mycoplasma and Chlamydia [132].

            "text": "An intensive investigation of the causes of pneumonia included all patients hospitalized for pneumonia at a Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center from July 5, 2011 to June 30, 2012 [33]. Blood culture, urine pneumococcal and Legionella antigen, PCR for 15 respiratory viruses (but not Mycoplasma or Chlamydia), and serum procalcitonin were each performed in more than 95% of cases. Sputum was studied in 70%. Of 259 patients admitted from the emergency department with CAP, 44 (17%) were thought to be uninfected, an observation with important implications for reconciling quality improvement measures that relate to promptness of antibiotic therapy. Of the remaining 215 patients (Table 3), 29% had documented bacterial infection; S. pneumoniae was detected in only 9% of the 215 patients. PCR identified a respiratory virus in 23%. Bacterial and viral coinfection occurred in 6% of cases. Despite an intense search for an etiologic agent, the cause remained unknown in 55%.",

Routine use of PCR for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia confirmed [132] that these organisms are very uncommon causes of CAP leading to hospitalization of adults, suggesting that serologic tests have contributed to marked overdiagnosis. Two more recent studies identified Mycoplasma as a cause of pneumonia in 6% of cases; however, 1 included 50% [133] and the other [134] included 25% of patients with a PORT (Patient Outcomes Research Team) score of \u22642.

The VA study [33] attempted to use clinical scenarios with support from laboratory and radiologic studies to distinguish bacterial from nonbacterial (largely viral) pneumonia. The investigators defined a likely bacterial pneumonia as 3 or more of the following: hyperacute presentation; septic shock; white blood cell count >15000 or <6000 with increased band forms; dense segmental or lobar consolidation; absence of upper respiratory symptoms; biphasic illness with upper respiratory symptoms followed by a sudden deterioration; or an elevated procalcitonin level. Likely nonbacterial pneumonia had none of these findings plus 2 or more of the following: exposure to sick contact(s); upper respiratory symptoms; patchy infiltrates; and a low serum procalcitonin level. About 58% of patients with no identifiable cause stratified to likely bacterial disease and 15% to likely viral disease; 27% could not be categorized. The authors hypothesized that so-called normal respiratory flora play a prominent etiologic role in patients whose syndrome suggested likely bacterial pneumonia and in whom all other tests failed to reveal a recognized pathogen.",

The principal challenges for the future appear to be to create a balance between overly sensitive and sufficiently sensitive diagnostic techniques, to identify an etiologic agent in the one-half of cases that now go undiagnosed, and to investigate the role of so-called normal respiratory flora in causing pneumonia. All these factors need to be considered as guidelines for management of community acquired pneumonia are formulated.",
