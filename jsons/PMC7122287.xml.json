            "text": "Although outbreaks of highly hazardous communicable diseases (HHCD) that require patients to be cared for in a high-level isolation unit (HLIU) can occur at any time, we have seen distinct periods with public health emergencies of international concern that created huge challenges to medical systems throughout many parts of the world, most notably the Ebola crisis in 2014 and the SARS epidemic in 2003. These crises led to an upscaling of isolation capacities in many countries and have also influenced the design of HLIUs as well as our thinking of how advanced the level of care provided under isolation conditions can or should be. Many units in the 1960s and 1970s were essentially conceived with a focus on containment, with comparatively few possibilities of medical care provision [1]. The SARS epidemic produced a dramatic need to provide critical care and ventilatory support under safe conditions in order to avoid transmission of infection to intensive care staff [2], and in the 2014\u20132016 Ebola outbreak, patients treated in the USA and Europe frequently required intensive care procedures inclusive of ventilatory support and renal replacement therapy [3]. Many of these procedures were performed for the first time in the setting of isolation precautions, even at the few specialized centers that exist. Although diseases like Lassa have sporadically produced import cases of hemorrhagic fevers in Europe and the USA [4], public health emergencies of international concern were generally followed by intervals of many years in which there were few or no cases. Hence, one of the challenges for many HLIUs is to maintain the capability to provide high-level care under isolation conditions in these intervals, which are long enough to undergo considerable staff fluctuation and changes in therapeutic algorithms and technology. Moreover, medical advances that occur in the meantime have to be translated into the setting of isolation treatment without the chance to realistically test them under these conditions. Additionally, the provision of high-level isolation medical care requires complicated standards and procedures that can easily be forgotten in \u201cpeacetime \u201d. It is thus of crucial importance to maintain a certain level of preparedness over extended periods of time until the next emergency occurs, necessitating HLIUs to be prepared to begin operations very quickly.",

HLIUs provide levels of infection control for healthcare workers and the community that cannot easily be provided in another setting. This level of infection control is necessary for HHCDs like Ebola, Lassa, SARS, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, smallpox and many others but may also be needed in case of new biological hazards of which the impact is yet unknown. There are different plans on the national level concerning the number of HLIUs required to maintain preparedness. Germany, the UK, the USA and Sweden, for example, possess more than one HLIU; however, other countries may have just one HLIU or even just a care agreement with neighboring countries [5]. The advantages of having more than one unit include shorter, safer journeys for patients from the referral point to the unit, cross-covering between units (e.g. when one unit is closed for maintenance), and the potential for a broader range of specialists. The number of staff needed for the treatment of an individual case can become massive if the patient condition requires very intensive treatment [6], and the availability of staff from a unit nearby may provide relief. This however requires coordination in skill maintenance and training, so that healthcare professionals can easily adapt to the local procedures and infrastructure within another unit. Disadvantages include increased costs, less frequent use and dispersion of clinical expertise. It is thus important to adapt the maintenance preparations to the network that an HLIU or a regional hospital is integrated into.",

These contact patients may be cared for in separate units but may also be concentrated in one unit, depending on the local procedures. An individual case of a hemorrhagic fever would usually produce very few contact cases, but respiratory pathogens of high consequence may produce many contact cases, particularly if the exposure occurs within an aircraft, leaving many contact patients with no place to go to where they can be monitored for symptoms of infection.",

It is impossible to give a universal recommendation on what type and how much of each material or medication will be required, as this depends on very individual circumstances. The precise type of personal protective equipment (PPE) used can greatly influence the necessary quantities. For example, some respirator suits use overalls with integrated gloves and some without. When using integrated gloves, the sizes of the complete suits available at an individual center must be very diverse, as a bad fit of a glove can be a safety hazard. Thus, complete suits must be available in all sizes to ensure proper fit. This means that the stockpiling will require larger quantities for the integrated models. Furthermore, the life span of a glove is much shorter than the one of the suit material, so that for the same amount of time, more suits will be needed based on the life span for the integrated model. Suits with no integrated gloves may be stockpiled in fewer size models, and gloves can be ordered separately. It is also important to be aware of what parts of the PPE are reusable and what parts will be discarded after use. Reusable material does not require stockpiling but does require regular function tests. It is extremely helpful to have experience with the amount of a particular type of PPE used in a real case in order to determine on how much stockpiling is needed.",

It must be kept in mind, however, that in the situation of a public health emergency, the demand for PPE and other material required may drastically rise [8] and outnumber the production capacity of the various producers. Therefore, the most critical infrastructure must maintain a safety margin of 3\u20134 weeks demand of material. Although it may be wise to harmonize the material used in adjacent HLIUs, as this would facilitate cross coverage if available, this may create issues with availability if too many HLIUs are using material by the same supplier.",

The CDC and the Public Health Agency of Canada maintain such supplies. Other countries like Germany do not maintain these supplies on a national level and leave this to individual HLIUs and local health authorities. Consideration should be given to maintaining a supply of ribavirin, which has proven useful for the treatment of Lassa as well as RSV pneumonitis in addition to its licenced indication for treatment of hepatitis C. However, particularly for Lassa fever, it should be administered intravenously, and the intravenous formulation may be difficult to obtain.

The number of physicians, nurses and other health professionals required rises with the severity of the disease in question. For example, in the Frankfurt HLIU, 88 staff members were involved in the treatment of one Ebola patient [6]. Similarly, the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit and the Emory Serious Communicable Diseases Unit utilized 5\u20136 and 2\u20133 nursing staff members per shift, respectively, when caring for Ebola patients [7]. When intensive care and specialized treatments are utilized, certain tasks may not be able to be performed by the core nursing and physician team. Whilst renal replacement therapy and minor technical questions can easily be handled by experienced ICU staff, more difficult questions may necessitate other specialized staff within the unit. Transfusion management, radiology and processing of laboratory specimens may be accomplished by specialists that are trained to enter the unit. Depending on the training of the physicians on the core team, procedures like endoscopy and surgery may require a specialist to enter the unit as well. Many HLIUs also train pediatric and obstetric nurses and physicians in order to ensure a high level of care for children and pregnant women. As an example, Table 13.1 demonstrates an annual training schedule used in the Frankfurt HLIU (Figs. 13.1, 13.2 and 13.3).\n\n\n",

The training is oriented towards an effective standard operating procedure to evacuate any current patients from the unit and to prepare the HLIU for admission of a patient with a highly hazardous communicable disease within a designated amount of time without compromising patient care. This amount of time is decided by local requirements. For the Frankfurt HLIU, which is only 15 min away from a major international airport, this period is naturally very short. It might be preferable to admit non-HHCD patients to an HLIU only when other isolation facilities are not available and to transfer these patients from the HLIU as soon as practical. On the other hand, regular use of the HLIU facilitates the regular maintenance of systems. The HLIU is however not the only unit involved in maintenance of preparedness training. Procedures need also to be practiced with local emergency departments, emergency medical services, the local health authorities and the reference, high-level security laboratories to provide for safe intersections of announcing and transporting patients and patient material.",

Additionally, needs for specialist non-clinical expertise (e.g. to repair ventilation systems or maintain near-patient testing equipment) should be assessed, and relevant staff trained appropriately in advance. Partly trained or newly trained individuals who need to enter the unit should be given just-in-time training, be escorted and be fully supervised. Ideally, psychological support should also be offered to the participants of an HLIU team, so it is important to include specialists in this area in ongoing maintenance of preparedness efforts.",

In order to maintain this preparedness, it is important to have a precise plan on how an individual HLIU is operational in the framework of local, regional and national plans. The maximum number of patients that would be admitted, the level of care provided within the HLIU and the technical prerequisites of the unit determines what measures need to be taken. One of the most important aspects of preparedness is the ability to maintain adequate numbers of trained staff capable of safely working in an HLIU. It is helpful to have protocols that provide guidance for nurses, physicians and others, as well as for the number of staff that need to be included in the training. The materials and supplies required depend on the type of PPE, equipment used and the size of the team. It is important to have a good understanding of the number of supplies that are required for the treatment of a real case in order to inform decisions on stockpiling necessary supplies. Training requirements are substantial, and adequate time must be provided to accomplish this. The psychological burden of working on an HLIU should be respected, and staff should receive information, counselling and team building measures to reduce that burden. These measures to maintain preparedness need to be well integrated and coordinated with interfaces like reference laboratories, transport organizations and the surrounding hospital infrastructure. Taken together, these measures will enable HLIUs to be ready when they are needed and are investments of time and resources that are necessary, even in the temporal absence of HHCD cases.",
