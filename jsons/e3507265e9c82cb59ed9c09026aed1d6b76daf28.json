The purpose of this paper is to bring conceptual clarity by investigating the alternative conceptualizations of e-recruitment in academic literature. Using Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM) techniques we analyzed literature to reveal five alternative conceptualizations; these being: (1) E-recruitment as a Technology Tool, (2) E-recruitment as a System, (3) E-recruitment as a Process, (4) E-recruitment as a Service, and (5) E-recruitment as a Proxy. The conceptualizations map to the scope of the definition and utilization of e-recruitment. Identifying conceptualizations of e-recruitment sets a platform for further research. Further research may include determining the relationships between the conceptualizations and determining conceptualizations in different settings among many other possible research focus topics.",

Unlike traditional recruitment, e-recruitment makes use of information technology to handle the recruitment processes. Breaugh et al. [1] defined a recruitment model that presents the recruitment process at a macro level with the following activities: Setting recruitment objectives, developing a strategy, performing the recruitment activity and obtaining and evaluating recruitment results. Recruiters compete with each other for candidates (jobseekers suitable for available jobs), while jobseekers compete for jobs; which drives both groups to adopt information technologies at accelerated rates in order to take the strain out of some of the recruitment activities [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . \"For most job seekers, the Internet is where the action is\" [3, p. 140 ]. Thus, to get candidates, recruiters need to move swiftly to locate and hire, which may require use of a multitude of information technologies in the process [8, p. 130 ].",

The variety of definitions of e-recruitment is expected because it is part of e-HRM (electronic Human Resource Management) that has in itself different definitions depending on the context [6, p. 26] , [9, p. 98] . Studies based on these definitions tend to reveal overlapping and contradictory results due to the overlaps or differences in definitions [9, p. 100 ]. The differences in definitions, aside from being problematic, is evidence of the variety in conceptualization of erecruitment. Thus to find a standard definition of e-recruitment, conceptualizations of erecruitment need to be known. To our knowledge, no research paper in e-recruitment has focused on conceptualization of e-recruitment, however there are studies in other areas of information systems (IS) that have focused on conceptualization [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Most view conceptualization as the formulation of a view about the nature of a phenomenon. The research questions to be answered are:",

Also, we wanted a flexible review methodology that would allow for selection and analysis of papers simultaneously, as the conceptualizations emerged, rather than a sequential review methodology that required all research papers to be selected beforehand. Such flexibility is provided for by applying grounded theory methodology (GTM) as a suitable review methodology [20] . GTM techniques used in this study included open coding to identify concepts, constant comparative analysis to refine and differentiate conceptualizations, and theoretical sampling to identify further relevant literature [21, 22] .

Some studies portrayed e-recruitment as a repository for data about jobs, recruiters and employers [40] . In another study online forms were filled in by jobseekers and the data provided on the forms was stored for recruiters and other stakeholders to retrieve [33] .
