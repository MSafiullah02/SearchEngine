            "text": "With further development of science, Industry developed from Industry 1.0 to Industry 2.0. Industry 2.0 covers the period from 1870 to 1914 and it was brought about mainly by the discovery of electricity, mass production and faster means of human transportation and communication. The discovery of electricity has evolved since a long time ago, but people have only been harnessing its power for about 250 years [1]. It was only until the late 19th century that electrical engineers were able to put electricity to industrial and residential uses. The rapid expansion in electricity technology at that time radically transformed industry and society. Electricity power was easier to use than water and steam power. Electricity\u2019s extraordinary versatility allows it to be put to an almost limitless set of applications, and electrical power is now the backbone of modern industry society [2]. This period also saw the development of new production which enables the increase in efficacy and effectiveness of manufacturing facilities. Henry Ford (1863-1947) took the idea of mass production from a slaughterhouse in Chicago. The pigs hung from conveyor belts and each butcher performed only a part of the task of butchering the animal. Henry Ford applied these principles into automobile production and drastically altered it in the process. Before his introduction of this concept into automobile manufacturing, one station assembled an entire automobile. Subsequently, the vehicles are produced in partial steps on the conveyor belt, resulting in significantly faster but at lower cost of production [3]. The Ford Company has now become a household name. The extensive building of railways in developed countries allows rapid human transportation from one city to another. The invention of telegraphy facilitates long-distance communication.",

Advances in knowledge in anatomy, physiology and immunology, and the rapid developments in surgical techniques, innovative technology and pharmacology allow organ transplantation to be carried out. The improvements in general anesthesia and the use of prosthesis allow major resectional and reconstructive surgery to be routinely performed in many centers around the world. What was technically not possible has become technically possible, incurable diseases become curable. Surgery has entered into an era of ultra-major surgery.",

The first article entitled \u201cEffects of preoperative warming on the occurrence of surgical site infection\u201d concluded that preoperative warming reduced the rates of surgical site infection after surgery. The second article on \u201cCritical appraisal of gastric conduit ischemic conditioning (GIC) prior to oesophagectomy\u201d concluded that GIC did not appear to reduce the overall rate of anastomotic leakage after oesophagectomy, but seemed to reduce the severity of leakage. The third article looking at \u201cThe efficacy of microwave ablation versus liver resection in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastases\u201d concluded that although microwave ablation may lead to a higher incidence of recurrence, it is an effective and safe alternative to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or liver metastases. The fourth article entitled \u201cLaparoscopic treatment of giant hiatal hernia with or without mesh reinforcement\u201d concluded that there was no evidence to support that routine use of mesh reinforcement in laparoscopic repair of giant hernias in decreasing recurrence and other complications. Last but not the least, the firth article entitled \u201cLingering risk: A meta-analysis of outcomes following primary total knee arthroplasty for patients with post-traumatic arthritis\u201d highlighted the complexity of post-traumatic arthritis, and demonstrated the increased risks of infection, complications, stiffness and revision after primary total knee arthroplasty.",

            "text": "There are 6 comparative studies with 2 being randomized controlled studies (RCT). The first RCT entitled \u201cVisualising improved peritoneal perfusion at lower intra-abdominal pressure by fluorescent imaging during laparoscopic surgery\u201d concluded that low pressure pneumoperitoneum was associated with improved perfusion of the parietal peritoneum, and the current available evidence supported its feasibility and enhanced postoperative recovery. The second RCT looked at \u201cThe effect of increased abdominal pressure on internal jugular vein catheterization under ultrasound-guidance on conscious patients\u201d concluded that pressure on the abdomen significantly increased the cross-sectional area of internal jugular vein, which helped to improve the success rate of one-off puncturing. The third study is a retrospective propensity score-matched study to look at \u201cThe relationship between anesthetic technique and 30-day mortality in patients undergoing noncardiac and nonneurosurgery\u201d. The study concluded that the results suggested a significant association between regional anesthesia and low 30-day mortality in these patients. There are 3 retrospective comparative cohort studies. The first one compared \u201cSingle versus multiple port laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma\u201d, and the study concluded that both these operations were feasible and safe. The second entitled \u201cFindings requiring immediate surgery in blunt abdominal trauma patients with isolated free fluid without solid organ injury on abdominal computed tomography\u201d concluded that surgical treatment should be actively considered in the presence of large volume of intra-abdominal free fluid, especially when concomitant with abdominal pain or after car accidents in blunt abdominal trauma patients with solid organ injury. The third compared a single surgeon\u2019s experience on manual versus robot-assisted total hip arthroplasty after the learning curve of the latter procedure. The study concluded that robotic surgery had an advantage in cup positioning than the manual technique.",
