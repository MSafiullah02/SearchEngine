Typically, a cell known as a macrophage ingests and degrades some of the invading pathogens. It then presents part (antigens) of the microorganism to a helper T cell (a lymphocyte), which then directs other lymphocytes known as B cells to produce antibodies to those antigens of that particular microbe that were presented. It usually takes at least 4 days before any microbe-specific antibody can be detected (Parslow, 2001).",

IgM, IgG, IgA, and secretory IgA are the principal classes of immunoglobulins with prime relevance to this chapter and will be discussed in more detail. In an infection, immunoglobulins usually appear in the order of IgM, IgG, and IgA. B cells first begin to produce IgM, and then some B cells undergo an irreversible switch to those that produce IgG. Later, some of these B cells undergo a switch to become IgA-secreting B cells. Immunoglobulins persist for varying times; for example, the half-life of particular IgM antibodies is approximately 5 days, while that of IgG can be as long as 21\u201323 days (Table 14.1\n) (Paul, 2008, Murphy and Weaver, 2016).",

The vaccine can be composed of a live or attenuated microbe, a whole nonproliferating microbe, or an antigenic (recombinant) part of the microbe or a toxoid. Regardless, the intent of immunization with a vaccine is to engender protection, often by the generation of protective neutralizing antibodies. Although the half-life of an individual IgG molecule is less than a month, a population of antibodies of the IgG isotype form may persist for life. Memory B cells can sustain these antibodies and retain the ability to quickly generate the appropriate antibodies when challenged. When the immune system encounters another infection or is subjected to a revaccination (booster), the result is an accelerated production of the particular antibody and increase in the levels of antibodies that circulate in the blood (Fig. 14.1\n).",

That response often involves IgM at the early stage and IgG later. Late in the course of the disease or during recovery, only IgG to particular antigens may be seen. A classic example of this is the human antibody response to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) (Bennett et al., 2015), a virus known to cause mononucleosis. During acute early disease, it is common to find high levels of antibody of the IgM isotype to the viral early antigen (EA) and viral capsid antigen (VCA). It is rare to find IgG antibody to the VCA or to Epstein\u2013Barr nuclear acid (EBNA) in anything but low titers (levels). As the patient recovers from their first infection with EBV, it is rare to find anything but low levels of IgM to EA or VCA, but IgG to VCA in higher or increasing levels is common. Antibodies to EBNA are often very low during this stage. Several months after clinical recovery, IgM to EA and VCA remain at low levels, whereas IgG to VCA and EBNA are present at high levels, often for years. Table 14.3 illustrates this pattern by stage of the immune response to EBV and its particular antigens. Fig. 14.3\nis a graphic display of these antibody responses. For the clinician or epidemiologist, the antibody responses provide a framework to determine where in the course of the infection a patient may be. Table 14.2, Table 14.3\nand Figure 14.2, Figure 14.3 illustrate how responses to a biothreat agent or its toxin may be used to give some chronological indication of exposure. Combining the antibody response with detection of particular antigens can provide further definition as to a timeframe of infection or exposure.",

The controlled experiment may be in a laboratory animal or a patient receiving a booster vaccine. The uncontrolled but normal clinical event occurs when the patient is reexposed to the infectious agent. Consider a generic antigen exposure. The first time the immune system encounters antigen X (AgX), it responds as shown in Figure 14.1, Figure 14.2. Initially, antibodies to AgX are barely discernible; then levels rise and later fall to a plateau. If a simultaneous exposure were to occur with AgX and a new AgY from another microorganism, the immune system would quickly mount a brisk response with high levels of Ab to AgX, while the course of Ab to AgY would be slow and delayed, just as it was in the response to the first exposure to AgX. This phenomenon is termed immunological memory or an amnestic response. This can be useful when the symptoms and signs of exposure to either X or Y are similar. This is the case with the early flu-like symptoms of pulmonary anthrax (Raymond et al., 2009, Waterer and Robertson, 2009, Bush et al., 2001) and with the influenza virus itself (Meltzer et al., 2010, Cao et al., 2009, Lessler et al., 2009).",

Three years later, the same individual exposed to a partially similar influenza virus responds preferentially to those antigens that were also present on the original influenza virus. The person also makes a smaller initial antibody response to new antigens, that is, those not shared with the first virus. Ten or 20 years later, during a new flu season and exposure to a third strain of influenza, the most brisk responses would be to antigens previously recognized by the immune system. This is the scientific basis for giving the flu vaccine, which contains a variety of possible antigens common to multiple strains of the flu virus so that a rapid and protective antibody response will occur.\n",

Ernesto Blanco, a 73-year-old mailroom clerk (case 2), experienced fatigue on September 24. He worked in the mailroom of the AMI building and delivered mail to the index case. On September 28, he developed a nonproductive cough, intermittent fever, runny nose, and conjunctivitis. These signs worsened through October 1 when he was hospitalized. In addition, he had shortness of breath with exertion, sweats, mild abdominal pain and vomiting, and episodes of confusion. His temperature was elevated to 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F), heart rate was rapid at 109/min, respiratory rate was slightly fast at 20/min, and blood pressure was 108/61 mm Hg. He had bilateral conjunctival injection and bilateral pulmonary rhonchi. At the time of admission, his neurologic exam was normal. No skin lesions were observed. The only laboratory abnormalities were low albumin, elevated liver transaminases, borderline low serum sodium, increased creatinine, and low oxygen content in the blood. Blood cultures were negative on hospital day 2, after antibiotics had been started. The chest X-ray showed a left-sided pneumonia and a small left pleural effusion but no \u201cclassical\u201d mediastinal widening (Dewan et al., 2002). The patient was initially given intravenous azithromycin; cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin were subsequently added. A nasal swab obtained on October 5 grew Bacillus anthracis on culture. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed bilateral effusions and multilobar pulmonary consolidation but still no significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Pleural fluid aspiration was positive for B. anthracis DNA by PCR. Bacterial cultures of bronchial washings and pleural fluid were negative. Immunohistochemical staining of a transbronchial biopsy demonstrated the presence of B. anthracis capsule and cell wall antigens. During hospitalization, his white blood count rose to 26,800/mm3, and fluid from a second thoracentesis was positive for B. anthracis DNA by PCR. Immunohistochemical staining of both pleural fluid cells and pleural biopsy tissue demonstrated the presence of B. anthracis capsule and cell wall antigens. Serial serum samples demonstrated > fourfold rise in serum IgG antibody to the PA component of the anthrax toxins by an ELISA assay. The patient was able to leave the hospital on October 23 on oral ciprofloxacin. Table 14.5\nillustrates both the clinical and microbial forensic approach and context in which to analyze such a patient. It is likely to be common to most situations where a biocrime is suspected to have affected an individual. The first set of questions is directed toward whether the person is sick: does the person have any indications of not being well and is laboratory evidence indicative of any infection? The second set of questions is oriented toward whether there is any specific and objective laboratory evidence of a particular infection. A third set of questions arise if the cause of infection was an agent on the Select Agent list (2003). These questions include was the infection acquired naturally or was it an intentional action that led to the infection; how did the particular individual acquire it if it was not a natural infection\u2014was he the target or a bystander. An alternative possibility in the right circumstances is a laboratory-acquired infection.",

Its major limitation was that only one antigen was used and only IgG was measured. Therefore, a negative result shortly after exposure may, in effect, be a false-negative result.

(Dewan et al., 2002) provide a contemporary background database on a group of postal workers who may have been exposed to B. anthracis. Beginning on October 29, 2001, 1657 postal employees and others who had been to the Washington D.C. postal facility went to the D.C. General Hospital for antibiotics in addition to those people whose treatment began on October 21, 2001. Serum samples were also obtained from the 202 individuals who had been to the Washington D.C. postal facility during the precious 2 weeks. All were negative for specific anti-PA IgG, including three individuals who reported a remote history of anthrax vaccination. The consistent negative findings may be explained by the fact that antibiotic therapy was initiated before serum testing and that there were no baseline serum samples available for testing. In addition, the time period from exposure to sampling was very short. Among 28 individuals in the Capitol region with culture-positive nasal swabs who received prophylactic antibiotics immediately, none had a positive culture from a nasal swab repeated 7 days later, and none developed IgG to PA antigen 42 days after exposure. This again emphasizes the limitation and interpretation of a test in someone who had early antibiotic treatment. It does raise forensic utility considerations. Even with these easily disseminated spores, an antibody response may be aborted or modified with antibiotics by early eradication. Furthermore, antibiotics taken before exposure would likely be effective in preventing laboratory and clinical signs of an infection. Detection of microbial DNA, antigen, or the organism itself on a person's body, clothing, or possessions should raise a red flag for exposure.",

The situation with the naturally occurring Yersinia is in contrast to the appearance of a case of smallpox which would raise an immediate red flag for a bioterrorist event. Cases need to be approached from an epidemiologic standpoint first to determine whether it is a naturally acquired case or whether the facts point to a deliberate introduction of the organism. Analytic techniques could include genomic analysis of an isolated organism and immunological response of the host. In the new era of rapid and deep sequencing, our capacity to investigate the genomics is growing (Mardis, 2008, Stavnsbjerg et al., 2017). In consideration of animal reservoirs, ELISA assays were compared with other tests for detection of plague antibody and antigen in multimammate mice (Mastomys coucha and. Mastomys natalensis) (Shepherd et al., 1986), which were experimentally infected and then sacrificed at daily intervals. IgG ELISA was equivalent in sensitivity to passive hemagglutination and more sensitive than the IgM ELISA and complement fixation. Antibody was detectable by Day 6 after infection using all four tests. IgM ELISA titers fell to undetectable levels after 8 weeks. Plague fraction 1 antigen was detected in 16 of 34 bacteremic sera from M. coucha and M. natalensis. This antibody pattern comparison shows that the principle of IgM versus IgG to this pathogen works to temporally situate the infection as an early versus late or past event. It also shows that when the information is combined with antigen detection, it engenders more confidence in the results. It should be noted that conclusions from this older reference has been substantiated with more defined antigens and assay technologies.",

            "text": "Melioidosis is caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei (Ashdown, 1992). Key clinical signs and laboratory results may raise the possibility of an infection with this pathogen. Whether it is an acute, persistent, or past infection can be determined by assessing several host responses. Often a simple indicator such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein (CRP) can raise a clinical suspicion of an infection. In a study of 46 patients with clinical melioidosis, 35 (22 culture-positive and 13 culture-negative) had relatively uneventful disease courses. Initially, they had elevated serum CRP that decreased with antibiotic therapy and returned to normal as the disease resolved. In another series of patients, IgM and IgG were measured by ELISA in 95 sera from 66 septicemic cases and 47 sera from 20 cases with localized melioidosis (Chenthamarakshan et al., 2001). Sixty-five sera from culture-negative cases seronegative for other endemic infections but suspected of melioidosis were also examined. Other controls included serum from 260 nonmelioidosis cases, 169 high-exposure risk cases, and 48 healthy individuals. The IgG-ELISA was 96% sensitive and 94% specific. All sera from cases with septicemic and localized infections and 61 of 63 sera from clinically suspected melioidosis cases were positive for IgG antibody. The sensitivity and specificity of the IgM ELISA were 74% and 99%, respectively. A geometric antibody index for IgM antibody in the sera of the melioidosis cases was significantly higher in cases compared with that of the noncase controls. In another study by some of the same authors, a rapid test for IgG and IgM was shown to have clinical utility (Cuzzubbo et al., 2000). A study with the intent of evaluating the utility of an IgG assay compared with other assays illustrates how the clinical and temporal context must be integrated for interpretation (Dharakul et al., 1997). It also illustrates how there is room for technical improvement in tests but the best setting is often the endemic area itself or at least using samples from that area in which the infections are occurring. These tests were evaluated in the actual clinical setting in an area endemic for melioidosis. Specificity of IgG (82.5%) and IgM (81.8%) assays was significantly better than that of an indirect hemagglutination test (IHA) (74.7%). The sensitivity of the IgG assay (85.7%) was higher than that of the IHA test (71.0%) and the IgM test (63.5%). Specific IgG was found in septicemic cases (87.8%) and localized infections (82.6%). The IgG test was also better than the IgM test and the IHA test in identifying acute melioidosis cases in the first 5 days after admission. IgG antibody to a B. pseudomallei antigen remained high for longer than 5 years in recovered, disease-free patients. Because this is a disease that may have an incubation of days to years, an acute case may very well be detected by a rise in specific IgM if it were a matter of days from infection. Although endemic for Southeast Asia, if B. pseudomallei was used as a biothreat agent in a different environment, its course and manifestations may not be recognized due to unfamiliarity with the disease.",

One study with the intent at looking for improved tests showed the utility of IgM to determine an early exposure to RVFV (Niklasson et al., 1984). Two ELISA IgM tests detected specific IgM antibodies to RVFV during the first 6 weeks after vaccination. Three inactivated vaccine doses were given on days 0, 6 to 8, and 32 to 34. ELISA serum IgM on days 6\u20138 were negative or in the lower range of detection; on days 32\u201334 the serum antibody values were strongly positive; on days 42\u201352, they were waning and in later collected samples were negative. The plaque reduction neutralization test was negative on days 6\u20138 and became positive in later samples. Similar to the examples shown above, these data suggest that three doses of RVFV vaccine induced a prolonged primary antibody response. The authors of that study concluded that the ELISA IgM may be useful for early diagnosis of acute human infection. Good correlation of a neutralization test and ELISA IgG would indicate a later infection.",

On one extreme is the situation that occurred with the onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) from the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) in the United States. Initially, there were no cases, and therefore a precise highly sensitive and specific test with excellent positive and negative predictive values (such as exists now when a combination of tests are used) would not likely yield a positive result in an area where there was little HIV infection and disease at the onset such as Kansas. A positive test by today's methodologies from a 1970 serum sample from Kansas would be considered a probable false-positive and warrant further investigation. Today, several viral and nucleic acid assays are available that would provide a definitive diagnosis in a short period of time (Bennett et al., 2015). However the same sample tested at the beginning of HIV testing could have been positive if the person had adult T-cell leukemia, which is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1) because the original tests for what became known as AIDS involved whole viral lysates in which up to 30% of the HTLV-1 sera cross-reacted. Questions regarding the interpretation of the test results could be raised by knowledge of different presentations of the infection. For example, HTLV-1 can actually be used in the laboratory to immortalize cells. In the patient, it actually increases the T-cell count, as is the nature with leukemia, instead of decreasing them, as with HIV infections. Other laboratory indicators such as hypercalcemia would now raise the leukemia as a consideration.",

This is important for the practice of medicine and can have relevance when extended to forensic analysis (Schutzer et al., 2005). The following examples illustrate this concept. Individuals who have syphilis, a treponemal bacterial infection, can typically have a positive fluorescent treponemal antibody test result for years, even after successful treatment. However, while infected they would have a positive venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test, which reverts to negative following successful antibiotic therapy. The VDRL test detects nonspecific anticardiolipid antibodies and can produce false-positive results with other conditions (e.g., pregnancy). There are some notable exceptions related to cross-reactive epitopes or autoimmune diseases. These are readily distinguishable by history and clinical information. Similarly, individuals infected with active tuberculosis will likely have a positive skin test (Mantoux) or a positive interferon-gamma release assay (Dewan et al., 2006, Ota and Kato, 2017), whereas the uninfected healthy person will be negative. In certain instances, a sick person with a cell-mediated immune deficiency will be anergic, that is, he/she will be negative to multiple skin tests including common antigens such as Candida. The key difference here is that there is a great difference between the healthy person being tested and an ill or immunocompromised individual being subjected to the same test.",

Antibiotics can abrogate the antibody response because ELISA results were negative in 30% of patients with known disease who were treated early (Dattwyler et al., 1988). In early cases, reactivity to a unique antigen, OspA, was also negative in serological assays despite a demonstrable T-cell response (Krause et al., 1992). Analysis of these same sera found that there was antibody to B. burgdorferi, but it was below the threshold of detection by conventional assays.

            "text": "Anthrax can be used as an example where investigatory leads can be generated by considering a scenario in toto. The elderly woman who died in Connecticut from inhalation of anthrax clearly had no occupational exposure nor was she known to have had contact with anyone who had anthrax. It was possible that she had contact with cross-contaminated mail. However, if this case had occurred as the index case or out of context of the mail attacks, it would have been reasonable to question her travel history, what her work if any was, or if she received or used spore-contaminated products from an anthrax endemic area. Similarly, the Vietnamese woman who died of inhalation anthrax in New York City would also have had these questions investigated. It would have been useful to search for direct or indirect evidence of anthrax by physical examinations of her contacts or close neighbors. Inspection and cultures from her workplace, apartment, and apartment complex (especially contiguous neighbors) are important for detecting the presence of B. anthracis. Coworkers, friends, neighbors, and other contacts could have had their serum analyzed for antibody to antigens of B. anthracis. These samples could have been frozen so that if one were positive it would be available for a comparison study in the future. At a minimum, these types of studies could serve as future control data for the geographic region. With molecular methods, even trace amounts might be detectable (Lasken and Egholm, 2003) although parallel investigation as to background control would be necessary. Although hypothetical, several results could have occurred, and each will be considered separately. First example, a close contact is positive for IgM to one of the B. anthracis antigens, such as PA. This finding would suggest that this person had recent exposure and, if nothing else, should be treated. This individual could conceivably be the one who knowingly or unknowingly passed the spores to the patient. Given the October 26 onset of illness, which is late in the mailing sequence, it would be less likely that this individual was a perpetrator but rather a recent victim. However, if this person were IgG-positive, then there are several other possibilities. Perhaps, this person had past exposure in an endemic region and was treated (e.g., Haiti, where anthrax is known as \u201ccharcoal disease\u201d). Or this person could have been vaccinated for bona fide reasons such as a researcher who received it for occupational exposure. Or this person could have obtained the vaccine originally for legitimate or illegal purposes but was nevertheless vaccinated. The vaccine usage may have been for a clinical trial or animal experimentation. Animal vaccines may be more obtainable without strict record keeping. This person could have loaded the mail with relative impunity if there was protective antibody generated from the vaccination. Situations similar to this one will require intelligence information regarding access, ability, and motive. In an area where recombinant vaccines are being developed or used antibody response would be different between someone using one type of recombinant vaccine as compared with someone using another type of vaccine. Nevertheless, finding IgG to one or more antigens of B. anthracis could point investigators toward such a seropositive individual, whereas an IgM finding could justify critical therapy. Where information points to a particular individual, investigation could be extended to search for ingestion or injection of antibiotics as illustrated below in the ciprofloxacin example. Questions would be raised regarding access to antibiotics, recent ingestion/injection of them, half-life of the antibiotic, half-life of the metabolites of the antibiotics, and in which body fluids or tissues can the residual be found. As illustrated from the data in the earlier sections, someone with antibiotics in their system may be protected following exposure to a potential pathogen. This person would be antibody-negative and likely antigen- and microbial DNA/RNA-negative, because the infection would have been eradicated before the organism can proliferate in any significant quantity. The widespread prophylactic use of ciprofloxacin during the period following the anthrax mailing attacks is illustrative of an understudied area. Ciprofloxacin has been increasingly associated with tendonitis and ruptured Achilles tendons (Akali and Niranjan, 2008, Palin and Gough, 2006, Godoy-Santos et al., 2018). In the future, better methodology to follow the pharmacokinetics of an antiinfective compound may have forensic implications. In the last example, someone who takes an antibiotic prophylactically while manipulating a lethal microbe may exhibit side effects that in the proper context of an investigation may add to the picture of possible culpability. This area is far from established at this point in time.",
