In a typical year, 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness are caused by seasonal influenza virus infection in the world. Children seem to be the main human transmitters of influenza viruses, as illustrated by studies showing that vaccination of children reduces the incidence of severe influenza virus infections in elderly individuals22. Incidence of influenza virus infections increases during pandemic years owing to the lack of pre-existing immunity against the new virus, but severity varies depending on the pandemic virus itself, with the 1918 influenza A H1N1 pandemic being the most severe of the past 100 years.",

Seasonal influenza virus-associated deaths in the United States range from 5,000 to 52,000 people per year, depending on the year26. Several comorbidities are known to increase the risk of lethal influenza virus infection. In addition, pregnancy and age are known risk factors, with very young (<1 year of age) and elderly (>65 years of age) individuals being the most vulnerable populations. Although mortality is low in children >2 years of age and young adults, a substantial number of deaths owing to influenza virus infection have been recorded in young individuals with no known predisposition factors. Approximately 100 children die each year from influenza in the United States; this number has been stable since 2010 (ref.27). Severe disease and/or mortality in patients with influenza virus infection are in general due to either virus-induced pneumonia or secondary bacterial superinfection. Primary viral pneumonia is characterized by high levels of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract accompanied by strong pro-inflammatory responses, also referred to as cytokine storm.",

Older adults, either because of immunosenescence, concurrent chronic illnesses or both, are also at risk of more-severe illness, hospitalization and infectious complications28. In addition to the extremes of age, other groups at risk of severe disease, hospitalization or death include those with chronic pulmonary or cardiac conditions, diabetes mellitus or immunocompromising conditions29,30. Possibly because of difficulty handling respiratory secretions, individuals with neuromuscular disorders are also recognized as being at increased risk31. Pregnancy has long been recognized as a risk factor for severe influenza disease, possibly because of the increased cardiopulmonary demands of pregnancy or the effects of pregnancy on the immune system; the risk increases by trimester and persists into the post-partum period32. During the 2009 pandemic with influenza A H1N1, morbid obesity with body mass index >35\u201340 kg per m2 was also recognized as an important risk factor33. Obesity is associated with excessive influenza virus replication, increased severity of secondary bacterial infections and reduced vaccination efficacy34. Finally, the role of host genetic factors in disease remains poorly studied, but polymorphisms and nonsense mutations in several host genes (such as IFITM3 and IRF7, which encode genes involved in the interferon pathway) have been shown to predispose to severe disease35\u201337.",

            "text": "Infection of waterfowl with low pathogenic avian influenza A (LPAI) viruses, called as such owing to their lack of lethality in poultry, produces little or no clinical symptoms38. However, upon transmission to poultry, LPAI can cause substantial disease symptoms; in addition, viruses with H5 and H7 subtypes can become highly pathogenic (that is, lethal) in poultry. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) throughout Eurasia and northern Africa are the major influenza disease burden in animals, with >400 million birds killed and economic losses totalling US$20 billion in the first 10 years of the 21st century39. Outbreaks of HPAI in poultry have also caused considerable problems in the United States, with the HPAI H5Nx (where x = 1\u20139) viruses, derived by reassortment of the Asian HPAI H5N1 viruses, being a recent example40. Recently, LPAI H7N9 viruses circulating in China have become HPAI through the acquisition of a multibasic cleavage site in their HAs and have also caused some self-limiting infections in humans41. Influenza A viruses can also cause mild to severe respiratory infection in a variety of mammals, including swine, horses and dogs; additionally, an outbreak of an influenza A virus of avian origin was detected in cats in New York, as first reported in December 2016. From its first report until February 2017, the influenza A H7N2 feline influenza A virus infected ~500 shelter cats and a veterinarian who treated one of the infected cats42.",

Indeed, domestic ducks raised on open ponds are the logical intermediaries between the reservoirs of influenza viruses in wild aquatic birds and other domestic poultry (Fig. 3). Transmission between birds can occur directly from contaminated water. Although most of the 16 HA and 9 NA influenza A subtypes cause asymptomatic infections in avian species, H5Nx and H7Nx subtypes can evolve into HPAI strains through the acquisition of a novel cleavage site in HA (which enables HA maturation by ubiquitous host proteases and spread of the virus outside the respiratory and intestinal epithelia to multiple organs, including the brain) and can cause lethal infections in chicken, turkey and some breeds of domestic duck44,45. Transmission of influenza viruses to multiple domestic poultry species occurs through so-called backyard farming, whereby species are raised together and in live poultry markets; subsequent transmission to commercial avian farms can occur through the lack of biosecurity (that is, procedures or measures designed to isolate and protect animals and humans from contact with infectious viruses) and because of viral spread through live markets46 (Box 2).",

The cellular cycle of the virus starts with binding to the target cell. This binding is mediated by the viral HA (which binds to sialic acids present in the oligosaccharides of the glycoproteins at the cellular surface) and is also responsible for the haemagglutination caused by virus particles when incubated with red blood cells. HAs from human influenza viruses bind preferentially to sialic acids linked by an \u03b12,6 linkage to the rest of the oligosaccharide, whereas those from most of the avian influenza viruses favour binding to \u03b12,3-linked sialic acids, as these bonds are the most abundant sialic linkages in the epithelial cells of the human upper respiratory tract and of the avian intestinal tract, respectively52,53. After binding, the virus is internalized in an endosome, and the endosome is trafficked and acidified, which triggers a conformational change in the viral HA that induces the fusion of the viral envelope with that of the endosome. As the endosomal pH varies between host species, the pH stability of HA is one of the determinants of viral tropism.",

Viral RNA replication occurs through a positive-sense intermediate, known as the complementary ribonucleoprotein (cRNP) complex. Viral RNA transcription results in positive-strand mRNAs that are capped and polyadenylated and exported into the cytoplasm for translation into viral proteins. Newly synthesized viral polymerases (PB1, PB2 and PA) and viral NP are imported to the nucleus to further increase the rate of viral RNA synthesis, whereas virus membrane proteins HA, NA and M2 traffic to and get inserted into the plasma membrane. Newly synthesized HA needs to be cleaved into HA1 and HA2 polypeptides by cellular proteases to be functional. The cleavage site of HA is responsible for the tissue tropism of the virus, with all influenza viruses having a cleavage site recognized by extracellular proteases present in respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells, except for the HPAI viruses, which contain a multibasic cleavage site in HA that is recognized by ubiquitous proteases. Viral nonstructural proteins NS1, PB1\u2013F2 (which can be dimeric or multimeric) and PA-x regulate cellular processes to disarm host antiviral responses. Viral M1 and NEP localize to the nucleus at late stages of viral infection, bind to vRNPs and mediate their export to the cytoplasm, where, through interactions with the recycling endosome, they migrate to the plasma membrane and are bundled into the eight vRNPs. Budding of new virions takes place, resulting in the incorporation of the vRNPs into new virus particles with a membrane derived from the host plasma membrane and containing the viral transmembrane proteins. NA activity prevents non-productive binding of HA of new virions to receptors bearing sialic acid present in the viral glycoproteins and in the membrane of the infected cells, facilitating viral spread. Viral replication results in cell death with pathological implications. In addition, viral products induce a pro-inflammatory response that is responsible for the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells, which clear and eliminate the virus, but that in excess induces immunopathology and pneumonia.",

Because HA is currently the main component of the inactivated influenza vaccines, human and animal influenza virus surveillance programmes are in place to monitor antigenic changes of the virus, primarily using the haemagglutination inhibition assay (a surrogate assay to measure the inhibition of the interaction between HA and host cell receptors) and viral RNA sequence analyses54,55. Increased attention to antigenic drift of NA, measured using neuraminidase inhibition assays, could further increase the antigenic match between vaccines and circulating viruses56\u201358.

Some viruses, presumably from waterfowl, have adapted to other birds (Galliformes, such as chicken, quail and turkeys) and mammals (such as humans, swine, equine, dogs, mink and marine mammals)70. Such inter-species transmission and adaptation often involve viral genetic adaptations to the new host and can be attributed to viral RNA polymerases, which are error prone and have higher mutations rates than cellular DNA polymerases. The ensuing intra-host viral genetic diversity (sometimes referred to as viral quasi-species) results in a \u2018swarm\u2019 of viral mutants that facilitate adaptation to new selection pressures. Multiple genetic variants are transmitted between animals, and low-fitness variants can be maintained during transmission, presumably helped by the fitter variants within a host71. Maintenance of such genetic diversity in the virus population within one host would be potentially advantageous in adaptation following inter-species transmission events.

Such functional changes that affect transmission could also be acquired through viral genetic reassortment, as occurred with the emergence of the human pandemics of 1957, 1968 and 2009 (ref.79).",

In another example, avian influenza A H3N2 viruses have adapted to dogs in Asia51. Recently, species of bat from Guatemala and Peru have been found to carry influenza A-like viruses with new subtypes of HA and NA (namely, H17, H18, N10 and N11), and further influenza virus diversity can be detected in bats6,80.

For example, the NS1 protein of the virus is an RNA-binding protein that prevents the activation of cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I; also known as DDX58)82. RIG-I recognizes the influenza viral RNAs on the basis of the presence of a terminal 5\u2032-triphosphate moiety and an adjacent double-stranded RNA structure formed by the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the viral RNAs that is required for viral RNA replication and transcription83. NS1 binds to the host factors E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM21 and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF135 (also known as Riplet), which are required for RIG-I activation after viral RNA recognition, preventing a signalling cascade that otherwise leads to induction of interferon and interferon-inducible antiviral genes with antiviral activity, such as MX1, EIF2AK2 (more commonly known as PKR), OAS1, IFITM family members and IFIT family members, among others84. Moreover, influenza A virus NS1 can also prevent host mRNA synthesis, processing and trafficking events, inhibiting host responses to viral infection85\u201387. Interferon signalling events mediated by the Janus kinase (JAK)\u2013signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway as well as the antiviral functions of several interferon-stimulated genes might also be targeted by NS1 to prevent the host antiviral response88\u201390.",

Nevertheless, exposure of these cells to viral infection results in their activation and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to the recruitment of additional innate cells, such as natural killer cells and pro-inflammatory monocytes, to the lungs, where they can control viral infection by killing infected cells. Although these host responses to infection are crucial for final viral clearance and induction of adaptive immune responses, an exacerbated response can lead to immunopathology and severe disease. For instance, high levels of neutrophil extracellular traps (chromatin-based structures released from neutrophils) can lead to lung damage and severe influenza virus infection96.

In their absence, antibody-mediated mechanisms might also work, though less rapidly. Prominent antigenic components are the NP, matrix protein M1 and the viral polymerases109. Of particular interest is the fact that infected cells display viral peptides 8\u201312 amino acids in length that bind major histocompatibility complex (MHC; encoded by the HLA genes) class I glycoproteins to form the antigenic complex (epitope) recognized by T cell receptors on influenza virus-specific CTLs. These peptides are generally derived from components inside the virus that are less subject to antibody-selected antigenic drift and, therefore, are more conserved across distinct influenza virus strains and subtypes. Strong evidence supports the idea that established CTL memory directed towards conserved viral peptides presented by widely prevalent human MHC glycoproteins (for example, that are encoded by HLA-A2) can provide a measure of protection against a novel influenza A virus that crosses over from an avian reservoir to humans101 (for example, the recent H7N9 cases101) (Fig. 6).

Live attenuated vaccines certainly have the potential to induce CD8+ T cell responses, but evidence to date suggests that they do not promote strong CTL memory110. Strategies aimed at maintaining large numbers of influenza virus-specific CTLs in the normal lung may both be impractical and have physiological consequences; instead, effector CTLs will likely need to be recalled from the recirculating \u2018resting\u2019 CTL memory pool. This approach can give more rapid virus clearance than is the case in a CTL-naive individual, resulting in milder disease outcomes.",

Antibodies contribute substantially to the protection from infection, as shown by early experiments in which sera from an influenza virus-immune ferret could protect a naive ferret from influenza disease after challenge113. B cell responses mainly target viral HA and NA and, to a lesser degree, other viral proteins, including the NP and the matrix proteins114. Of note, discrete antigenic sites on the head domain of HA seem to be the preferential target of the antibody response115; these sites are immunodominant over most other B cell epitopes of the virus116,117. However, the molecular and immunological reasons for antigenic immunodominance remain obscure. Antibodies that target the head domain of HA are typically neutralizing (via blockade of receptor binding) and show inhibitory activity in the haemagglutination inhibition assay. Importantly, the haemagglutination inhibition titre correlates (imperfectly) with protection and is a surrogate marker for vaccine efficacy that is globally accepted by regulatory agencies118.",

For example, antibodies raised to strains encountered in childhood can usually be detected at reasonable levels in elderly individuals and might protect from virus variants with similar antigenicity encountered later in life119\u2013122. However, antigenic drift particularly affects the HA head domain, which has high plasticity123,124. Over the course of a lifetime, individuals might be exposed to or infected by influenza viruses several times. Interestingly, the first infection in life and its immune imprinting might skew antibody responses to subsequent exposures. This phenomenon was originally described as the original antigenic sin125, but different aspects of it have been called antigenic seniority, antigenic imprinting and back-boosting126. Typically, exposure to a new virus variant (or subtype) might also induce antibodies to viruses encountered earlier in life, depending on the relatedness of the two antigens. An antibody response against a novel virus variant in adults might, therefore, be heavily influenced by the individual\u2019s exposure history117,127,128, which is an issue for vaccine development.",

            "text": "As influenza-like illness can be caused by many viruses, the gold standard laboratory tests used for influenza are viral culture and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (Table 1). Virus culture is critical for detailed characterization of novel viruses, surveillance of sensitivity to antiviral drugs and monitoring of antigenic drift; it is time consuming, but the length of the test can be reduced if shell-vial co-cultures are used, which detect virus-positive cells by immunostaining before the presence of cytopathic effect145. By contrast, RT-PCR, which is a highly sensitive and specific molecular test, is quick, can be incorporated into multiplex assays and can be used to subtype viruses. The nucleic acid amplification tests are clearly superior to virus culture in both sensitivity and speed in the context of clinical management. For both viral culture and RT-PCR, the quality of the sample is important, as irregularities in handling can lead to degradation and false-negative results. The site sampled can also affect the sensitivity of the assay; nasopharyngeal swabs are preferred to throat swabs for detection of the virus during upper respiratory infection. As neither of these assays provides a point-of-care diagnosis, rapid antigen tests have been developed that are fast, can be run in a physician\u2019s office and are less expensive, although low and variable sensitivity is a limitation. To overcome this limitation, a rapid molecular assay has been developed and approved by the US FDA, with results comparable to those of RT-PCR except in samples with low viral loads146. New point-of-care digital immunoassays also have superior sensitivity in detecting influenza A and influenza B virus infections compared with traditional rapid antigen tests147. Several recent point-of-care nucleic acid amplification tests with even higher sensitivities147 are now approved in United States. Future developments might include the use of transcriptomic approaches to diagnose both the cause and the severity of respiratory illnesses, for example, the presence of secondary bacterial infections and/or inflammatory markers148.",

The manufacture of influenza virus vaccines involves growing the virus in embryonated chicken eggs and inactivation using formalin (or another alkylating reagent). In the 1970s, two changes were introduced. First, reassortment of up to six internal RNA segments of the high-yielding influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 strain with RNA segments encoding HA and NA of the seasonal vaccine candidates improved the growth characteristics of the virus in embryonated eggs with obvious advantages for vaccine production (Fig. 7). Second, the whole virus is now subjected to treatment with ether or detergent to make subvirion (or split) preparations, which are much less reactogenic and are more tolerable for the patient (reviewed in ref.150).",

Vaccine strain selection for both inactivated vaccines and LAIVs is based on the determination of the prevalence of recent human circulating strains by multiple laboratories engaged in a WHO-sponsored influenza surveillance programme (Box 3). LAIVs seem to have advantages in inducing mucosal and more broadly protective immune responses in infants and children than inactivated influenza virus preparations (reviewed in ref.150).

The adjuvant used, AS03, similar to MF59, is a squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion that is combined with the H5N1 component before intramuscular injection. AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza virus vaccines have previously been used in Europe during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, where they received close attention owing to several reported cases of vaccine-associated narcolepsy156, a chronic neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness.

Although preparing for potential pandemic threats is sound public health policy, it is not compelling to assume that the influenza A H5N1 viruses (or the more recently detected H7N9 virus (March 2013)) are pandemic precursor strains because they are associated with the largest numbers of human infections among animal influenza A virus strains. First, over the past 130 years, only viruses expressing an H1, H2 or H3 HA have been responsible for seasonal or pandemic strains. Avian H5N1 and H7N9 viruses have most likely circulated for at least as long without spilling over into humans and starting a new pandemic162. Accordingly, these \u2018avian\u2019 HA influenza viruses are unlikely to easily transmit from person to person. Second, the high case fatality rates cited by the WHO for H5N1 and H7N9 viruses in humans seem to be an artefact of the way they were calculated (that is, counting only patients who were hospitalized as having been infected by these viruses); many more people seem to have been infected by these viruses without severe outcomes163,164. Additionally, severe disease only results from exposure to large quantities of the virus, which can occur when people are in direct contact with diseased poultry. However, transmission of seasonal or pandemic influenza viruses requires only small quantities of virus (estimates vary between 2\u201325 virions165 and 50\u2013400 virions166) to cause severe disease and transmission.",

            "text": "The emergence of drug-resistant viruses is a major challenge for the antiviral field. Adamantane resistance (conferred by an S31N mutation in the RNA segment encoding M2) first emerged in influenza A H3N2 viruses in 2003 and became prevalent worldwide by 2008 (ref.179). The pandemic 2009 influenza A H1N1 virus, which is presently circulating as a seasonal H1N1 virus, is also resistant to the adamantanes, as its M RNA segment (Fig. 1) was inherited from a virus that carried the S31N mutation180. Thus, since 2009, only the NA inhibitors have been able to provide protection, with the currently circulating human influenza A and influenza B viruses being generally sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir (Table 2). However, emergence of oseltamivir resistance is of particular concern for influenza A H1N1 viruses because it has happened in the past; in 2007, resistant influenza A H1N1 viruses began to circulate and quickly became dominant by the 2008\u20132009 season181. The resistant phenotype is associated with an H275Y mutation in the RNA segment encoding NA, and studies have shown that, in the background of other permissive mutations, H275Y-mutant viruses do not display any fitness deficits, which explains their ability to circulate so readily182,183. Of note, these viruses remain sensitive to zanamivir. Perhaps fortuitously, the oseltamivir-resistant seasonal influenza A H1N1 virus was displaced by the introduction of the oseltamivir-sensitive pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus in 2009. Since then, surveillance efforts have monitored NA inhibitor sensitivity closely and, although oseltamivir-resistant isolates of the 2009 influenza A H1N1 virus have been detected, these are primarily (but not exclusively) from patients undergoing therapy184. Susceptibility to NA inhibitor is assessed by measuring NA enzyme inhibition in a functional assay using cultured virus. Alternatively, RT-PCR capable of detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (or RT-PCR followed by sequencing) is used to detect known resistance mutations in NA185, but the functional assay may be required if novel mutations are present.",

Also, patients who have been hospitalized are more likely to be treated for longer periods, which will increase pressure on the virus and the likelihood that a resistant strain will emerge. Although this outcome may be predictable, oseltamivir resistance arose in 2007 seemingly in the absence of drug pressure; given the correct background of secondary mutations, the same outcome is a possibility for the current influenza A H1N1 virus188. Oseltamivir resistance among influenza A H3N2 viruses and influenza B viruses has also been reported, albeit at a much lower frequency than for influenza A H1N1 (ref.189).",

Several candidates are now in clinical trial, including additional NA inhibitors that can be delivered intravenously, such as intravenous formulations of zanamivir. Another NA inhibitor, laninamivir, has been approved for use in Japan; this drug is inhaled and long-acting and requires less frequent administration than oseltamivir or zanamivir190. Ideally, future influenza therapies will involve a cocktail of drugs with different mechanisms that should increase the barrier to resistance. Thus, drugs other than NA inhibitors are being clinically tested; within this pipeline are favipiravir (which is a polymerase inhibitor for several RNA viruses191), pimodivir (which prevents the cap binding required for viral RNA transcription192), baloxavir marboxil (an inhibitor of the cap-dependent endonuclease activity of the influenza viral polymerase193) and nitazoxanide (an inhibitor of HA maturation194). Baloxavir marboxil received approval in Japan in 2018. Favipiravir has also been approved in Japan since 2014, but only for release from government stockpile in the event of a novel strain being unresponsive to current agents. Treatment of patients who have been hospitalized with immune plasma195 or with hyperimmune immunoglobulin (pooled from plasma of donors with high titres of anti-influenza IgG)196 is also being clinically evaluated. In addition, several monoclonal antibodies against the conserved region of the HA stalk are also under clinical development for the treatment of severe influenza infection197. Many more candidates are in preclinical development and will hopefully lead to improved options for influenza therapy in the future.",

Effective use of antivirals for seasonal influenza in otherwise healthy adults requires early initiation of therapy, generally within the first 48 hours of symptom onset.

This classic strategy was successful in the majority of Eurasian countries to which HPAI H5N1 spread206. However, late detection and widespread dissemination of HPAI H5N1 in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Egypt resulted in endemicity, making virus eradication difficult206. One difficulty in eradication is inadequate provision of compensation to farmers, who will be incentivized to hide infected animals.",

Primary pneumonia occurs predominantly among patients with influenza virus infection who also have underlying cardiovascular disease, especially rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis, but may occur in a variety of settings. Primary viral influenza pneumonia is characterized by a rapid progression of fever, cough, dyspnoea (laboured breathing) and cyanosis (low oxygen levels resulting in bluish skin), with chest radiographs often revealing bilateral findings consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome.",

Pandemic years and seasonal years when the vaccine is mismatched are especially concerning. Mismatches in vaccine occur not only when the most prevalent antigenic strains are missed but also when the vaccine becomes antigenically mismatched owing to adaptations to egg culture. For example, the 2016\u20132017 seasonal influenza vaccine produced in eggs lacked a glycosylation site present in the influenza A H3N2 circulating strains. This change was due to egg adaptation and led to an alteration of the antigenicity of the influenza vaccine component225.

RNA segments 6 and 8 encode more than one protein, namely, the matrix protein (M1) and membrane protein (M2) \u2014 BM2 in the case of influenza B \u2014 and the nonstructural protein NS1 (not shown) and nuclear export protein (NEP). The M1 protein is thought to provide a scaffold that helps the structure of the virion and that, together with NEP, regulates the trafficking of the viral RNA segments in the cell; the M2 protein is a proton ion channel that is required for viral entry and exit and that, together with the HA and NA glycoproteins, is located on the surface of the virus anchored in a lipid membrane derived from the infected cell. Finally, the NS1 protein is a virulence factor that inhibits host antiviral responses in infected cells. The influenza viruses can also express additional accessory viral proteins in infected cells, such as PB1\u2013F2 and PA-x (influenza A), that participate in preventing host innate antiviral responses together with the NS1 protein or NB (influenza B), the function of which is unknown. NS1, NEP, PB1\u2013F2 and PA-x are not present in the virus particle or are present in only very small amounts. NB is a unique influenza B virus surface protein anchored in the lipid membrane of the virus particles.",

Influenza A H2N2, H3N2 and H1N1 viruses caused the 1957, 1968 and 2009 pandemics, respectively. In 1977, influenza A H1N1 restarted circulation in humans without causing a pandemic, as the strain was similar to that which preceded the 1957 influenza A H2N2 pandemic. By contrast, the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus was antigenically very different to the previous seasonal influenza A H1N1 viruses and replaced them as the circulating influenza A H1N1 strain. Examples of the spreading of human influenza A viruses in the world are shown for pandemic 1918 and 1957 viruses and for seasonal H3N2 viruses18. For pandemic virus outbreaks, the arrows indicate the first and second waves of transmission. For seasonal influenza A H3N2 spread, the arrows indicate the seeding hierarchy of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses over a 5-year period, starting from a network of major cities in east and southeast Asia; the hierarchy within the city network is unknown. Seasonal influenza B viruses (not shown) are co-circulating in humans with influenza A viruses.",

Influenza viruses from wild birds can spill over through water or fomites to marine mammals and to domestic free-range ducks. Transmissions to other avian species (for example, poultry) from domestic ducks or directly from wild birds can also occur from contaminated water. Transmission from ducks to other species occurs through \u2018backyard\u2019 farming, whereby the animals are raised together, and in live poultry and/or animal markets. Transmission from backyard to commercial farms can occur via lack of biosecurity and via spread through live markets46. Humans can be infected with poultry and swine influenza viruses through aerosols, fomites or contaminated water. However, in most instances these infections do not result in subsequent human-to-human transmission. Human-to-human transmission of seasonal or pandemic human viruses can be mediated by respiratory droplets, aerosols or self-inoculation after touching of fomites. Additional virus adaptations would be required for sustainable human-to-human transmission of animal influenza viruses. Other domestic animals known to be susceptible to influenza virus infections are dogs and cats. Dashed lines represent transmission that bypasses a domestic duck intermediate.",

The lack of pre-existing immunity to the antigenically novel H3 HA in humans facilitated human transmission. Similar reassortment processes have taken place during other influenza A virus pandemics. Once H3N2 became established in humans, the virus began to drift, as is the case with all other human seasonal influenza viruses. During drift, small antigenic changes in the HA protein generated by mutation are selected to increase immune evasion, although not as dramatically as during shift.
