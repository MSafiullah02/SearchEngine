Body condition and the ability to allocate resources to immune processes can profoundly affect the outcome of infection as can sex, age and social status (East et al., 2015; Schmid-Hempel, 2003) . Quantifying individual differences in the outcome of infection and determining the impact of infection on Darwinian fitness in wildlife populations may be a challenge because diagnosing the infection status for large numbers of individuals is difficult in practice, particularly if only non-invasive methods are available (Gimenez, Lebreton, Gaillard, Choquet, & Pradel, 2012; McClintock et al., 2010) . This probably explains why little is known about these processes in natural environments. Obtaining such information is, however, crucial to improve knowledge of host-pathogen dynamics and predict the likely impact of diseases, particularly during epidemics, on the most vulnerable classes of individuals and on population longterm viability (Gervasi, Civitello, Kilvitis, & Martin, 2015; Hawley & Altizer, 2011; Kappeler, Cremer, & Nunn, 2015; Oli, Venkataraman, Klein, Wendland, & Brown, 2006) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 146, "text": "(Hawley & Altizer, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 289, "end": 316, "text": "(Beldomenico & Begon, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 317, "end": 343, "text": "VanderWaal & Ezenwa, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 500, "end": 519, "text": "(East et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 520, "end": 540, "text": "Schmid-Hempel, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 865, "end": 919, "text": "(Gimenez, Lebreton, Gaillard, Choquet, & Pradel, 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 920, "end": 944, "text": "McClintock et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1289, "end": 1335, "text": "(Gervasi, Civitello, Kilvitis, & Martin, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1359, "text": "Hawley & Altizer, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1391, "text": "Kappeler, Cremer, & Nunn, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1392, "end": 1442, "text": "Oli, Venkataraman, Klein, Wendland, & Brown, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| INTRODUC TI ON"}, {"text": "In social mammals with stable dominance hierarchies, an individual's social status regulates its access to (food) resources and is thus often positively correlated with both body condition and fitness (Clutton-Brock & Huchard, 2013) . Even so, the relationship between an individual's social status and the outcome of infection with a given pathogen is less straightforward. Several studies suggest that socially dominant animals are more frequently exposed to pathogens because they are \"valuable\" social partners which experience higher contact rates with conspecifics than subordinates, for instance when forming and maintaining social bonds (Seyfarth, 1977) . Such a positive relationship between social status and exposure has been shown in several mammals (e.g. MacIntosh et al., 2012) . On the other hand, subordinate individuals may be less exposed but more likely to contract diseases than dominants and experience a more severe outcome when infected. This is because subordinates, whose access to resources is limited, have a higher allostatic load, i.e. a higher cumulative energetic cost of maintaining homeostasis (Cavigelli & Chaudhry, 2012; Goymann & Wingfield, 2004; Kappeler et al., 2015; Sapolsky, 2005) , and thus their allocation of resources to immune processes is more often curtailed. Despite considerable research into the influence of social processes on disease risk and spread, often with the use of social network analyses (e.g. Cauchemez et al., 2011; Duboscq, Romano V., & MacIntosh, 2016; Kappeler et al., 2015; MacIntosh et al., 2012; Nunn, Jord\u00e1n, McCabe, Verdolin, & Fewell, 2015) , to our knowledge few studies on wildlife populations have investigated the effect of social status on fitness by explicitly accounting for the effect of both these processes: (1) variation in exposure to a pathogen (\"exposure\" hypothesis) and (2) variation in the outcome of infection determined by the opportunity to allocate resources to immune processes (\"allocation\" hypothesis).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 201, "end": 232, "text": "(Clutton-Brock & Huchard, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 645, "end": 661, "text": "(Seyfarth, 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 768, "end": 791, "text": "MacIntosh et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1127, "end": 1155, "text": "(Cavigelli & Chaudhry, 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1182, "text": "Goymann & Wingfield, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1205, "text": "Kappeler et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1221, "text": "Sapolsky, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1480, "text": "Cauchemez et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1481, "end": 1519, "text": "Duboscq, Romano V., & MacIntosh, 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1520, "end": 1542, "text": "Kappeler et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1543, "end": 1566, "text": "MacIntosh et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1567, "end": 1614, "text": "Nunn, Jord\u00e1n, McCabe, Verdolin, & Fewell, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| INTRODUC TI ON"}, {"text": "Multi-event capture-mark-recapture (MECMR) models are a recent and powerful advance in statistical methods that make it possible to disentangle the effect of both processes on the infection probability and to determine the impact of infection on survival (Chambert et al., 2012; Conn & Cooch, 2009; Gimenez et al., 2012; Pradel, 2005) . Here, we used this approach to assess the effect of social status in a highly social carnivore, the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta (hereafter \"hyena\") on canine distemper virus (CDV) infection during an epidemic when a strain pathogenic to this species circulated (Nikolin et al., 2017) . CDV is a highly contagious virus of a taxonomically broad range of carnivores (Beineke, Baumg\u00e4rtner, & Wohlsein, 2015; Deem, Spelman, Yates, & Montali, 2000) . The outcome of CDV infection ranges from subclinical to fatal, and as with other morbilliviruses, individuals surviving the infection acquire lifelong immunity (Appel & Summers, 1995) . After transmission to a susceptible host, CDV targets lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and lymphatic tissue and induces immunosuppression, which enhances the spread of CDV through the bloodstream (asymptomatic and non-contagious stage, Tatsuo, Ono, & Yanagi, 2001) . In the next stage, CDV enters epithelial cells, which results in the manifestation of clinical disease and virus shedding (Sawatsky, Wong, Hinkelmann, Cattaneo, & von Messling, 2012) and finally, CDV attacks the central nervous system, causing neurological signs (symptomatic and contagious stages). During all stages, CDV profoundly suppresses host immune responses, predisposing infected animals to secondary infections (Sawatsky et al., 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 255, "end": 278, "text": "(Chambert et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 279, "end": 298, "text": "Conn & Cooch, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 299, "end": 320, "text": "Gimenez et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 321, "end": 334, "text": "Pradel, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 600, "end": 622, "text": "(Nikolin et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 703, "end": 743, "text": "(Beineke, Baumg\u00e4rtner, & Wohlsein, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 744, "end": 782, "text": "Deem, Spelman, Yates, & Montali, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 945, "end": 968, "text": "(Appel & Summers, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1216, "end": 1244, "text": "Tatsuo, Ono, & Yanagi, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1369, "end": 1429, "text": "(Sawatsky, Wong, Hinkelmann, Cattaneo, & von Messling, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1692, "text": "(Sawatsky et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| INTRODUC TI ON"}, {"text": "In 1993/1994, a virulent CDV epidemic caused the death of an estimated 30% of the African lion Panthera leo population in the Serengeti National Park (NP) (Roelke-Parker et al., 1996) .

The importance of elevated contact rates among high-ranking clan members for the transmission of infectious pathogens is illustrated by significantly higher seroprevalence to virus infections among high-ranking than lowranking hyenas in our study population as well as in another one (Harrison et al., 2004) . High-ranking hyenas within the separate linear dominance hierarchies among adult females (plus their offspring) and among adult reproductively active males have high rates of contact with clan members, thereby facilitating \"hyena-to-hyena\" CDV transmission through contact with virus shedding individuals.

Rank-related differences in social contact among females probably explain why high-ranking females are more likely to become infected than low-ranking ones (Table 2 ). This result is consistent with the findings of a previous study in the same hyena population where the higher contact rates of high-ranking adult females significantly increased their probability of exposure to rabies . Interestingly, more frequent (asymptomatic) exposure to CDV among high-ranking adult females would induce protective CDV titres and may have benefitted their cubs through the transfer of these antibodies during lactation, an idea consistent with our finding that highranking cubs had a lower infection probability than low-ranking ones. The effect of social status among males was not identifiable.

The impact of these viruses on the fitness of susceptible (non-vaccinated) juveniles was not quantified. Our study does quantify the lethal impact of an infectious juvenile viral disease in a fission-fusion society, similar to that in humans, and with transmission hotspots (communal dens) similar to schools and kindergartens. Hence, our results may provide useful insights into infectious juvenile diseases in humans as well as those in other mammalian species with a similar social structure.There has been considerable and valuable research on the relationships between sociality and disease based on network analyses. This research demonstrates that social contact rates (e.g. grooming) could influence disease transmission or burden and vice-versa (e.g.Bansal, Read, Pourbohloul, & Meyers, 2010;Chen et al., 2014;Duboscq et al., 2016). Social networks are increasingly integrating disease dynamics in their analyses (e.g.Springer, Kappeler, & Nunn, 2017;Vazquez-Prokopec et al., 2013;Volz & Meyers, 2007) but to our knowledge no network-based study has ever considered dynamic processes in both the pathogen and the host. The main challenge of social network analyses most likely lies in the difficulty of describing feedback dynamics between host social networks and disease-related fitness costs in the host(Van Segbroeck, Santos, & Pacheco, 2010;Volz & Meyers, 2007). As an alternative to social network analysis, other studies, including ours, use surrogate variables for contact rates.
