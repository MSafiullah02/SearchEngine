However, only recently the associations between sleep and immunity have rendered a more systematic interest (Irwin and Opp, 2017). Insufficient sleep alters immune functions (Irwin, 2015), and proper sleep is an important factor supporting a strong and efficient first line of defense against infections (Cohen et al., 2009, Prather and Leung, 2016). However, the relationships are bidirectional, sleep being altered in a number of infectious diseases (Opp and Krueger, 2015).",

It has been hypothesized that these alterations support recovery and are adaptive responses to infection. Indeed, because cytokine-induced behavioral changes during sickness (i.e., \u201csickness behavior\u201d) are known to be adaptive and to contribute to an efficient host response against the pathogen (Dantzer, 2001), it is probable that the modifications to sleep during an infection also benefit immunity (Imeri and Opp, 2009). This is supported by animal models (in rodents, rabbits and drosophila), where less sleep reduces survival while more sleep improves survival from infections (Everson and Toth, 2000, Kuo and Williams, 2014, Toth et al., 1993).",

Two small studies where subjects were injected with virus (5 developed influenza like illness, ILI) after injection with Influenza B, and 5 developed ILI and 4 developed a common cold after injection with rhinovirus) showed longer self-reported sleep during the symptomatic period, but no effect on sleep quality or awakenings (Smith, 1992). An EEG study in subjects after a rhinovirus injection showed a shorter sleep duration during the symptomatic period, but no effects on the amount of REM or NREM sleep (Drake et al., 2000). A likely explanation for the inconsistencies is that human sleep seems more vulnerable to fever responses than animal sleep (Mullington et al., 2000). There is little support for an increased sleep duration in infected humans, which may be due to differences between humans and animals, but also due to study design limitations that have not allowed subjects to stay in bed for longer than 8 h (Drake et al., 2000, Mullington et al., 2000).",

Since sleep is believed to be part of an adaptive immune response and to aid recovery, it is surprising that no prior study has reported how naturally occurring respiratory infections (RI) affect objective sleep. The aim of the current study was to provide data regarding this issue by assessing subjective (diary ratings) and objective (actigraphy) sleep for one week during a naturally occurring acute respiratory infection. Enrolled people contacted us when suffering from symptoms fulfilling criteria for ILI (i.e., having at least one respiratory symptom such as cough, and one systemic symptom such as fever) or acute respiratory infection (ARI, i.e., having coryza with a systemic symptom), and were followed for one week, and subsequently followed again four weeks later if symptom free. Our hypotheses were that people would sleep longer during a respiratory infection but with reduced quality of sleep, with respect to both objective and subjective sleep. We believed that sleep alterations would be largest at the beginning of the week and then reduce as people recovered. Since people got sick on different days of the week (a factor affecting sleep), we also analyzed the influence of weekday on the outcomes.",

During sickness, people also reported having worse sleep quality, increased difficulties falling asleep, more restless sleep and less deep sleep. These findings are in agreement with two small previous studies of infections in humans that reported longer times in bed during the symptomatic period of an ARI or ILI induced by rhinovirus or influenza infection (Smith, 1992) and more awakenings during sleep (Drake et al., 2000). Critically, in the current study people slept objectively longer when having a RI, as well as suffered from a number of additional subjective sleep disturbances. Collectively, our findings indicate that the reduced sleep duration reported previously in response to an experimental rhinovirus infection (Drake et al., 2000) probably resulted from the study design (limiting time in bed to 8 h), and, that in a natural setting, individuals are likely to prioritize time in bed to increase their sleep duration when sickness symptoms are high. Despite subjects sleeping longer during a RI compared to when healthy, and in contrast to animal models (Toth, 1995), the data does not necessarily support an increased sleep need in response to the infection. It seems possible that the increased time in bed and total sleep duration could also result from people prioritizing sleep more when sick, compared to when healthy - many people often sleep slightly less than they should to be fully saturated (Axelsson and Vyazovskiy, 2015).",

In our study, sick individuals experienced more difficulties falling asleep, lower sleep quality, more restless sleep and lighter sleep compared to when they were healthy. Increased self-reported sickness symptoms were associated with stronger subjective sleep disturbances, namely lower sleep quality and restless sleep. Subjective sleep disturbances were worst when the symptoms peaked (at the beginning of the sickness period), then improved throughout the week as symptoms subsided, suggesting that subjective sleep disturbances can be driven by symptom intensity. Having a RI increased the number of awakenings compared to when healthy, in line with previously reported EEG measures during symptomatic rhinovirus infection (Drake et al., 2000), and this likely contributes to the subjective sleep disturbances we observed.",

            "text": "Notably, none of the objective sleep variables was significantly related to the degree of sickness symptoms or body temperature. This may be due to low power, large individual differences or different pathogens affecting sleep, temperature and symptoms in alternate ways. The fact that very few people were found to have fever may be due to differences in how people take their own temperature (despite clear instructions and three measures each time), and tympanic temperature not being a very reliable measure of core temperature (Moran et al., 2007). Furthermore, there was a clear weekend effect in temperature, most likely due to that subjects had different bedtimes and sampled their temperature later than during weekdays. Thus, data from the present study are not directly comparable to previous studies with better temperature measures, and where injections with bacterial endotoxin (e.g. LPS) causes systemic inflammation and stronger fever responses (Mullington et al., 2000). Overall, Mullington et al.\u2019s findings indicated that limited pro-inflammatory responses increase the drive for sleep, while stronger immune challenges that also trigger endocrine and thermoregulatory host responses disturb sleep. Thus, the natural immune response to an infection can both increase the drive for sleep, and disturb sleep via host response mechanisms and other sickness symptoms. These findings also are consistent with the notion that inflammatory processes are involved in sleep disturbances (Irwin and Opp, 2017). Given that poor sleep quality and longer sleep latency are central symptoms in insomnia, and that they were observed during ARI, it is possible that immune processes contribute to pathological states of sleep disturbances.",

            "text": "There is strong support for sleep to supports the innate immune system and to be particularly important for the defense against infections (Irwin, 2002, Toth, 1995): naturally occurring short sleep, as well as sleep disturbances, increase the risk of developing a rhinovirus infection (Cohen et al., 2009, Prather and Leung, 2016). However, it remains unclear whether alterations in sleep patterns or architecture during infection are adaptive or whether they are predominantly side effects of an activated immune system. While more awakenings during sleep when the body fights an infection might have detrimental effects (Kuo and Williams, 2014, Lange et al., 2006), it may also be protective since it would also carry fever-promoting benefits (Imeri and Opp, 2009). On the other hand, the participants in this study clearly prioritized more time in bed, resulting in a longer total sleep time despite more frequent awakenings. This supports a reorganization of the infected host\u2019s behaviors to favor sleep, in line with animal studies (Toth, 1995). The increased time in bed during sickness could thus be an adaptive mechanism counteracting the detrimental effect of infection on sleep architecture, and possibly on immune function, by permitting the host to sleep as much as possible and increase sleep duration. Nevertheless, increased sleep duration was mainly apparent at the beginning of the sickness episode, when symptoms were greatest. It is possible that a longer sleep duration is no longer required in the second phase of an infection, when most of the pathogen has been eliminated, or when disturbed sleep no longer need to be compensated for by longer sleep time and time in bed. In this scenario, sleepiness and fatigue during the initial stages of infection (DellaGioia et al., 2013, Lasselin et al., 2017) would play an important role in promoting sleep and an effective host response. Alternatively, as symptoms subside, life-related obligations may simply regain higher priority at the expense of sleep. While the present literature show that sleep is altered during an acute infection, it is still unclear whether these alterations facilitate recovery.",

The early studies by Smith found that subjective sleep was reduced during the incubation period of a respiratory infection (Smith, 1992), although this was not supported in polysomnography measured sleep in the study by Drake and colleagues (Drake et al., 2000). Future laboratory studies will have to determine how sleep during the incubation period can alter the course of infection. Furthermore, while the present study did not include a measure of depressive-like symptoms, an interesting aspect would be to analyze whether the relationships between infections and sleep disturbances are mediated by depression, as well as whether depression like symptoms are intensified as a consequence of the ARI-sleep relationships. Finally, although measuring sleep after recovery allowed to determine differences in sleep during ARI compared to when being healthy, measuring sleep at study entry (i.e., before the occurrence of ARI) would allow the analysis of how baseline sleep predicts susceptibility to infections.",

It would have been highly interesting to measure the impact of specific viral and bacterial infections on sleep, and it is probable that different causative agents were responsible for the RIs studied, also considering the fact that disease presented in the subjects between September and March the following year. To assure the existence of an acute respiratory infection, we used the criteria for ILI, a nonspecific respiratory illness caused by a number of viruses (e.g., influenza virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus) and only included subjects with both systemic and respiratory symptoms (ECDC, 2012). Different respiratory viruses may have differential effects on sleep, particularly since some generate more severe symptoms than others, but symptom severity also varies greatly between individuals when suffering from the same virus. An additional limitation is that 13 of the subjects medicated at least once during the sickness week (e.g., 6 medicated against pain, 3 took antihistamines against allergies, and 4 took any of nasal spray, cough medicine or eye drops). While the medication is likely to have reduced some symptoms and possibly affected sleep, it was not feasible to make people avoid normal medication and symptom relief. The results should thus be seen as a description of how respiratory infections can affect sleep in a healthy normal population, where medication against symptoms is common, and that there is a need to further evaluate how medication influences the likely bidirectional relationships between symptoms and sleep.",

Data loss was larger than expected, and there is a possibility that this caused a bias in the data, i.e., that subjects were less likely to wear the actigraph when sick. However, the fact that the data loss was similar between conditions indicates that this was not the case. Still, future home based studies would likely benefit from a more frequent contact with a research assistant encouraging and reminding subjects to adhere to the protocol. In addition, more regular temperature measurements by a trained person, measurements of blood cytokine concentrations, mucus production, and virus type, would give a better possibility to disentangle how different aspects of acute respiratory infections affects sleep. In future studies, it would also be highly interesting to know how specific symptoms relate to sleep (i.e., does a bunged up nose affect sleep differently than fever?). In line with this notion, better measurement of symptoms should be used, combining self-report symptoms with objective assessment of symptoms in a controlled manner. Another limitation with the present study is a possible order effect, where the subjects started with the RI week. It is possible that a first night effect caused a systematic bias in the results, although actigraphs do not disturb sleep as much as EEG and should be smaller when people sleep in their own home compared to than when sleeping in a laboratory. While actigraphy is a valid method for measuring sleep and some sleep disturbances, it can also underestimate wake time during sleep and it is a poor method for measuring naps (Sadeh, 2011). Thus, further studies that control for potential order effects and employ mobile EEG measurements are needed to increase our understanding of how sleep quality is affected. It is likely that nap duration may have been part of the sleep changes during sickness, but since this is difficult to measure accurately in the field, this should preferably be measured in laboratory conditions.",
