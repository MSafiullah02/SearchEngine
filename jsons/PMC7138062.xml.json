In the second step, known as adaptation, the emerging agent becomes established and disseminates within the host population. The factors that contribute to this process are complex; they include microbial adaptation, advances in technology and industry, international travel and commerce, the breakdown of public-health measures, economic development and increased land use, changes in human demographics and behaviour, and war and famine.4\n",

For example, genetic analyses have suggested that HIV infection was transmitted to human beings from a common subspecies of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes).5 Another well-publicised example of zoonotic transmission is severe acute respiratory syndrome, caused by the transmission of a new coronavirus to people, initially in southern China and probably from small mammals, which are the natural hosts of the severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome coronavirus.6 After the virus first appeared in human beings, there was an explosive short epidemic. Since clinical symptoms preceded the peak of transmission of this virus, outbreaks were restricted by quarantine measures in China, Canada, and other countries. Many epidemiologists predict similar types of outbreaks in the future with emerging viruses.",

The natural host is the flying fox (fruit bat); cross-species transmission of the virus to animals occurred in southeast Asia where farmers inhabited areas that had been cleared of forests, inadvertently exposing their livestock to flying-fox habitats.7, 8 In the late 1990s, there were several outbreaks of Nipah-virus infection in pigs, with subsequent transmission of the virus to human beings. In Malaysia, of 265 people infected during an outbreak of Nipah-virus infection, 105 died, a mortality rate of 40%.9 Two other outbreaks of Nipah-virus infection have since occurred in Bangladesh.7, 8 The mortality rate among infected individuals approached 70% in the Bangladeshi outbreaks, and in contrast to the Malaysian outbreaks, the virus might have been transmitted from one person to another. Hendra virus, a type of henipavirus, causes disease in horses and was reported to be transmitted via exposure to secretions from an infected racehorse to its trainer. The transmission vector remains unknown but could be an arthropod.10\n",

New emergent viruses might therefore have to acquire genetic mutations before active propagation within people is possible. Some RNA viruses have mutation rates as high as one nucleotide per 10 000 copied and therefore could be especially likely candidates for zoonotic transmission.11 However, the evolution of a potentially large number of adaptive mutations that enable productive replication and efficient continuing transmission in a new host is rare, which might help to explain the low frequency of emerging agents. However, when an emerging pathogen does succeed in adapting to a new host species, the outcome can have a worldwide effect. New pathogens are also more likely to emerge in conjunction with opportunistic infections in highly immunosuppressed individuals, such as those with congenital immune defects, cancer, or AIDS.12 Immunosuppression, especially in xenotransplantation settings, might enable a poorly adapted virus to replicate and adapt to human beings and act as a bridge to subsequent infection of the healthy population.13, 14\n",

In many cases, an increase in incidence reflects a change in the interaction between host and vector, such as that caused by extraordinary changes in ecosystems.15 For example, Rift Valley fever was the ultimate cause of a cumulative 200 000 deaths after construction of the Aswan Dam on the River Nile in Egypt in the 1960s created conditions in which the arthropod vector flourished.16 Guanarito arenavirus emerged in Venezuela after forest clearing disrupted the local ecology.17 This viral pathogen can be transmitted from rats to human beings, in whom it causes haemorrhagic fever and can pose a threat to the blood supply. As more people congregate within mega-cities, especially those of less developed countries with less advanced hygiene systems, more emerging infectious agents that arise by disruption of ecosystems can be expected.",

The most important clinical phenotype of non-lethal infection is meningoencephalitis.23 The virus first emerged during a 1999 outbreak in New York City, resulting in 62 confirmed cases and 22 deaths.24, 25, 26 During 2000 and 2001, similar numbers of human cases were noted in the eastern USA, and evidence of WNV found in birds, farm animals, and mosquito pools showed that the virus had spread over the whole eastern coast and had begun to spread westward. In 2003, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 9862 cases of WNV infection in 46 states and 264 associated deaths. The numbers were smaller in 2004, with 2470 reported cases in 41 states and 88 associated deaths. Infections have now been recorded in some parts of Canada and Mexico. Currently, 2% to 3% of people in certain areas of the USA are seropositive for WNV. The estimated risk, for example, of transmission of the virus through transfusion during the 1999 epidemic in New York was about 2\u00b70 viraemic donations per 10 000 donors in the borough of Queens.27 The risk varied greatly with time and location during 2002, reaching as high as 1\u00b75 in 1000 donations.18 Of the 2\u00b75 million blood donations screened for WNV from June to December, 2003, 0\u00b705% were positive at first screen, and 0\u00b702% were confirmed. Interventions to block transmission of WNV are hampered by the fact that 80% of cases of infection are subclinical or asymptomatic. Since WNV is readily inactivated by low pH, high temperature, and detergents, it is of less concern with plasma-protein-derived CFC, for which these treatments are typically used during manufacturing.",

Between 1980 and 1999, the number of cases of dengue virus in the Americas increased by 50 times (figure 2\n).30 The primary mosquito vector for dengue virus, Aedes aegypti, was almost eradicated from the USA after the DDT spraying campaigns in the late 1950s but the population is now recovering.31 By comparison, in Brazil there is an epidemic of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever, with an estimated 500 000 to 1 000 000 cases per year. Other epidemics are occurring in Central America, southeast Asia, and parts of Africa and Oceania. Worldwide, an estimated 2\u00b75 billion people are at risk. The infection has a viraemic phase that lasts 3\u20135 days, and most cases remain subclinical. Since no screening tests are in place, dengue virus might be expected to pose a future concern for the blood supply.",

More than 70 serotypes have been isolated from people, including polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, enterocytopathic human orphan viruses, and enteroviruses 68\u201371. The normal site of replication for these viruses is the gastrointestinal tract; infection is subclinical or results in a mild disorder in many cases. However, some of these viruses can spread through the blood to other parts of the body, including the central nervous system. The resulting diseases can be severe, partly depending on the specific enterovirus serotype. Enteroviruses that undergo viraemic phases in their life cycle and are associated with substantial morbidity (eg, enteroviruses 70 and 71) could be particular threats to blood products.36, 37, 38, 39, 40 Enterovirus 70 was the causative agent of epidemics of acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis in Africa, Asia, India, and Europe between 1969 and 1974. Enterovirus 71 seems to be highly pathogenic and neurovirulent and has been associated with epidemics (eg, in Taiwan, Japan, and Australia) of various acute diseases, including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, paralytic poliomyelitis-like disease, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, herpangina, non-specific febrile illness, upper-respiratory-tract infection, enteritis, and viral exanthema.36, 37, 38 Enterovirus infections can have a transient viraemic phase that precedes symptoms. This feature, in combination with their resistance to inactivation, makes them a potential threat to the blood and CFC supplies. In a study in Scotland, 0\u00b7024% of blood donations showed evidence of enterovirus viraemia.41 This proportion predicts about 1000 enterovirus-contaminated transfusions per year in the UK. A wide range of viral loads (figure 3\n) and enterovirus serotypes were detected, including enterovirus 71, coxsackieviruses A2, A5, A10, A16, B2, B3, B4, and B5, and echoviruses 11, 13, 18, and 30. In the light of the numbers of potential infected donations, initiation of screening methods for enteroviruses might be prudent to exclude the possibility of blood-transfusion-associated transmission of potentially pathogenic variants such as enteroviruses 70 and 71.",

Each has a vast number of distinct genotypes. Infected people seem to be viraemic with a wide range of genotypes of both viruses, and viral loads are constantly high. Importantly for blood products, these extremely small and stable non-lipid-enveloped viruses cannot be removed easily by nanofiltration and as with other circoviruses important in veterinary medicine, such as porcine circovirus (PCV), they are likely to be highly resistant to heat and other viral inactivation protocols used in manufacture of blood products. There are no known human diseases associated with circoviruses, but some features suggest that caution is warranted. These viruses have been associated with clinical disease in other species; infection with PCV2 is the most commercially important disease in pigs today, leading to multisystemic wasting syndrome.43 The virus is the cause of 15% of deaths in pigs, and it has already jumped species to cattle and sheep. Chicken anaemia virus, an avian circovirus, has been transmitted through contaminated manufactured livestock feed, a further indication of the resistance to inactivation of these viruses. In human beings, transmission of circoviruses to neonates can be associated with upper-respiratory-tract infection.44 Since these viruses might maintain their continuously viraemic but asymptomatic state in human beings through some immunosuppressive function, there is a theoretical concern that they might also suppress the immune response to other infectious agents.",

The parvovirus feline panleucopenia virus (FPLV) might therefore constitute a future threat to people because of its ability to cross mammalian barriers. It is a small non-lipid-enveloped virus that typically infects cats, mink, raccoons, Arctic foxes, and raccoon dogs. In 1978, a new pathogenic variant emerged in dogs and became known as canine parvovirus (CPV),45 which causes hyperthermia, vomiting, diarrhoea, leucopenia, dyspnoea, myocarditis, pneumonitis, and in some cases, virus-induced encephalitis.46, 47 FPLV took about a decade to assume its new host range.48, 49 One of the first changes that differentiated CPV from FPLV and other animal viruses was in the haemagglutinin molecule. Since then, strains of CPV have undergone a series of changes, presumably in response to evolutionary selection, which resulted in the global distribution of new variants.48 New antigenic variants (CPV2 types, including 2a, followed by 2b then 2c) have been isolated from cats and dogs in Japan and Brazil, which suggests that interspecies transmission, and presumably genetic conversion, continues.50, 51, 52 Host adaptation of CPV in canines suggests the possibility of similar cross-species transmission, followed by adaptation in human beings.52 This potential development could be accelerated by the close contact between dogs and people throughout the world. Because they are small, resistant, non-lipid-enveloped viruses, such emerging parvoviruses could pose a substantial future threat to blood and blood products.",

JC virus causes chronic meningoencephalitis and is associated with progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, a fatal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Typically, the course of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy is gradual, with initial impairment of cognitive function, speech, vision, and movement. As it progresses, the pathology accelerates, and patients develop more severe disabilities, including dementia, paralysis, blindness, then coma, followed by death. The frequency of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy increased with the AIDS pandemic, but now, with effective antiretroviral therapy, HIV-infected patients rarely develop this disorder.51, 52 Shedding of JC virus (and BK virus) in urine is significantly more common in HIV-infected patients than in non-HIV-infected individuals.59 Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy is rare in children and young adults and is more common in people in their 50s and 60s; this feature suggests that reactivation of latent virus, and not primary infection, is the cause of viral disease.",

Compared with whole blood or plasma, CFC have the additional safety advantage of undergoing plasma fractionation and are subject to procedures to reduce numbers of viruses during manufacture, including chromatographic fractionation, nanofiltration, solvent detergent treatment, and heat inactivation. Thus, plasma-derived coagulation factors now have a very low risk of transfusion-mediated infection with HBV, HCV, HIV, and HTLV I and II.

They are effective at preventing and stopping haemorrhage in most patients with haemophilia and have therefore revolutionised the lives of patients. Many are able to treat themselves at home.

The only licensed recombinant factor IX concentrate, BeneFIX, is also a third-generation concentrate. To improve safety in the manufacture of recombinant concentrates, all manufacturing processes now include a virus-inactivation process, such as solvent detergent. In addition, the monoclonal antibodies used to purify factor VIII from cell cultures are made from hybridoma cell lines grown in the absence of added mammalian protein. Although recombinant CFC are judged to be at lower risk of transmitting infectious agents, concern has been expressed that they might be associated with a higher incidence of alloantibody development in response to the transfused factor VIII.82 Future gene-transfer technologies might allow the preparation of human clotting-factor proteins by novel and high-yielding processes that would enable the native protein to be expressed.",
