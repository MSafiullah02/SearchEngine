The association of acute respiratory infections (ARI) incidence in passengers is statistically significant with season, destination and duration of travel.2 In February 2012, an outbreak of respiratory illness occurred on the cruise ship off Brazil, resulting in 16 hospitalizations due to severe ARI and one death.3 In May 2009, a dual outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and influenza A (H3N2) on a cruise ship occurred: of 1970 passengers and 734 crew members, 82 (3.0%) were infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, and 98 (3.6%) with influenza A (H3N2) virus.4 Four subsequent cases were epidemiologically linked to passengers but no evidence of sustained transmission to the community or passengers on the next cruise was reported.4 In September 2000 an outbreak of influenza-like illness was reported on a cruise ship sailing off the Australian coast with over 1100 passengers and 400 crew on board, coinciding with the peak influenza period in Sydney.5 The cruise morbidity was high with 40 passengers hospitalized, two of whom died. A total of 310 passengers (37%) reported suffering from an influenza-like illness.",

The number has since ballooned into the largest coronavirus outbreak outside of mainland China. By 19th February, 619 of 3700 passengers and crew (17%) were tested positive. By end February, six persons had died. The outbreak was traced to a Hong Kong passenger who embarked on January 21st and disembarked on January 25th. After docking near New Taipei City, on January 31, the ship arrived in Yokohoma, Japan. By the following day, the Japanese health ministry ordered a 14-day quarantine for everyone on board and rushed to close its ports to all other cruise ships. The public health measures taken according to news reports and the media were removal of all PCR positive passengers and crew from the ship and their isolation in Japanese hospitals. The remaining test-negative passengers and crew remained on board. Passengers were quarantined in their cruise ship cabins, and only allowed out of the cabin for one hour per day. By 20th February, the decision to evacuate was made and more than 3000 passengers left the ship. Most were air-evacuated by their respective countries.10",

We had no access to data on incident cases in crew versus passengers, nor any data on whether there was clustering of cases around certain nationalities or crew members. Furthermore, although the Hong Kong passenger was assumed to be the index case, it could well have been possible that there was more than one index case on board who could have contributed to transmission, and this would have lowered our estimated R0. Lastly, our models are based on human-to-human transmission and do not take into account the possibility that fomites, or water systems with infected feces, contributed to the outbreak.",

However, the main conclusion from our modelling is that evacuating all passengers and crew early on in the outbreak would have prevented many more passengers and crew members from getting infected. A scenario of early evacuation at the time of first detection of the outbreak (3 February) would have resulted in only 76 latent infected persons during the incubation time (with potentially still negative tests). A late evacuation by 19th February would have resulted in about 246 infected persons during their incubation time.
