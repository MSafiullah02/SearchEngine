            "text": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a complex regulatory network consisting of enzymes and effector peptides that facilitate the maintenance of homeostasis of several physiological processes [1, 2] . Upregulation of the RAS system, however, under chronic conditions and mainly through the interactions of Ang II with the AT1 receptor, can lead to hypertension and is involved in the progression of diabetic and nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) [2, 3] . Clinical interventions targeting the RAS and its pathogenic actions have been centered on the use of RAS blockers [3] . More recently, it has been proposed that the RAS system could be therapeutically targeted by increasing Ang II degradation and Ang (1-7) formation via ACE2 enzyme activation [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] . ACE2, a monocarboxypeptidase discovered in 2000, metabolizes Ang II by removing a single amino acid, phenylalanine, from the C-terminus of this peptide [8] , which results in the formation of Ang-(1-7) [8, 9] . Angiotensin-(1-7) has anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative actions that tend to counteract the proinflammatory and pro-proliferative effects of Ang II.",

When compared with historic samples from healthy subjects, however, all CKD groups examined, i.e. predialysis, transplant patients and even subjects on dialysis, seemed to have increased levels of plasma ACE2 activity. Statistical comparisons with healthy controls, however, could not be done because samples from healthy individuals were not assayed concurrently with those in the present study.

Studies before and after the dialysis procedure could be informative in this regard. In the study by Roberts et al. [16] , samples from patients on hemodialysis were collected prior to commencing dialysis, and on the middle dialysis day of the week. Removal of the inhibitor during the dialysis procedure, however, could only increase plasma ACE2 activity which is the opposite of what was observed in dialysis patients. The results of this study can therefore be interpreted to signify that the extraction of the endogenous inhibitor by dialysis is not a cause of reduced plasma ACE2 activity. A possibility that the small-molecular inhibitor of ACE2 might form a complex with ACE2 protein thereby evading extraction during dialysis needs to be considered.",

The source of circulating ACE2 in healthy individuals and CKD patients is not clear but release from the kidneys is a possibility. The levels of ACE2 activity have been found to be 10-to 30-fold higher in mouse kidney cortex than in the heart [22] and urinary ACE2 activity is about 10-fold higher in urine than in plasma [28] . The mechanism of how ACE2 reaches the circulation and is then released into plasma is not well understood and requires further examination. It has been proposed that soluble ACE2, which lacks its cytosolic and transmembrane domains, arises from proteolytic 'shedding' of the membrane-bound enzyme [15] . It is, nevertheless, conceivable that the full-length, membrane-bound ACE2 can also be released into plasma, especially in disease states associated with tissue damage, such as myocardial infarction.",

It is possible, however, that under pathologic conditions, there may be an aberrant neoexpression of ACE2 in endothelial cells [31] .

While in males plasma ACE2 activity was strongly associated with BNP, which is increased in left ventricular hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction, female patients undergoing hemodialysis showed significant associations with diabetes and postdialysis systolic blood pressure. Whether these associations have pathogenic or therapeutic implications awaits further examination. Moreover, the authors found that female hemodialysis patients compared with male counterparts had lower plasma ACE2 activity. Analogous trend of lower plasma ACE2 activity in the female group was observed for kidney transplant patients, which is similar to the recent findings of Soler et al.

Whether ACE2 in plasma is indeed altered in CKD patients needs to be confirmed in further studies that include contemporary measurements from healthy control subjects. Moreover, a longitudinal follow-up of a CKD cohort would be ideal to monitor ACE2 activity as renal function declines over time. Several other questions remain unanswered, such as the mechanism driving ACE2 into circulation in disease states. Regardless of the mechanism, the reduction in plasma ACE2 activity reported in ESRD patients treated by dialysis, particularly in female subjects, could limit Ang II degradation leading to increased levels of this peptide which could contribute to the high prevalence of hypertension [32] and cardiovascular morbidity [33, 34] that afflicts the dialysis population.",
