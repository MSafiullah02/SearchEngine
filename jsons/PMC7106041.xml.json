He returned to Hong Kong on 28 March. After he was admitted to a hospital, Mr. X made a phone call to warn his younger brother, but it was too late. The younger brother who developed symptoms on 31 March became the first SARS-related fatality (TC1) in Taiwan.

Two days later she visited a hospital in Taipei complaining of general fatigue. In addition to the local hospital, she visited two private clinics before being referred to Taipei Municipal Hoping hospital on 9 April. She spent less than 6 h in that hospital's emergency room, but she probably transmitted the virus to two patients, an assistant nurse who escorted her to the X-ray room, and a laundry worker who handled her isolation gown. These individuals transmitted the SARS virus to other medical personnel and patients, resulting in the entire hospital being shut down for more than 2 months starting on 24 April. According to the ROC CDC, the Hoping hospital nosocomial infection resulted in 66 probable and 22 suspected SARS cases (Wu et al., 2003). Even though the Taiwanese government imposed a quarantine on 28 April on all air travelers arriving from China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Macau, or Toronto, the virus still spread to different parts of the main island of Taiwan and the adjacent Penghu Islands. By 1 September, 346 SARS cases in Taiwan had been confirmed by RT-PCR or serological tests (WHO, 2003).",

The type I glycoproteins of coronaviruses, whose trimers resemble typical viral spikes, is transformed into virions through non-covalent interactions with M proteins. Coronavirus S proteins contain two domains (or two subunits, depending on whether or not S is cleaved) (Spiga et al., 2003). The S1 domain contains virus-neutralizing epitopes and the receptor-binding domain (Leparc-Goffart et al., 1998, Sanchez et al., 1999). Xiao et al. (2003) recently localized the SCoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) to amino acid residues 303\u2013537 of the S1 protein. As shown in Fig. 6, we observed seven amino acid differences in the RBD of the S protein, including amino acid residues 311, 344, 360, 442, 479, 487 and 501. If we assume that the RBD is (a) conserved among different SCoVs, including civet SCoVs (Bonavia et al., 2002), and (b) more than 30\u201350 amino acids in length (Lasky et al., 1987), then it is possible that the RBD can be mapped onto amino acid residues 360\u2013442.",
