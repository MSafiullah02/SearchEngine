Inves4ga4on of signatures of balancing selec4on in Africa, and of posi4ve selec4on in non--synonymous variants on \u0394G background Long--term balancing selec1on maintains several alleles in a popula1on and enhances gene1c diversity. That is in contrast with posi1ve or purifying selec1on, which favor only the best available allele and result in popula1on homogeneity [1] . Given that pseudogeniza1on of IFNL4 via TT is advantageous in some human popula1ons (at least in East Asia) while, func1onal IFNL4 (\u0394G) has been evolu1onarily maintained throughout the mammal clade, it is possible that both alleles have been under balancing selec1on in some popula1ons (for example, through temporal or spa1al varia1on in selec1on). This would fit with the intermediate frequencies observed in African popula1ons (Figure X10) , if for example an advantageous TT variant carried a locally deleterious phenotype that prevented its rise in frequency in par1cular popula1ons. Given the func1on of IFN--\u03bb4 in immune defense, this could be driven by variability in the pathogenic environment [2]. In humans, for example, a scenario where two alleles in the FLT1 gene fluctuate between being advantageous/deleterious in/out of malaria season has been described [3].",

The HKA [4] test is based on the assump1on that under neutrality divergence is propor1onal to diversity (polymorphism), and both are solely dependent on the muta1on rate. Under selec1on, though, this ra1o is affected: long--term balancing selec1on is expected to result in an enrichment of polymorphisms, while complete (or nearly complete) sweeps of posi1ve selec1on will result in a deficit of polymorphisms (or an excess or subs1tu1ons).

Under long--standing balancing selec1on we also expect an excess of diversity due to the long--term maintenance of two or more alleles in the popula1on; this signature is detected by the HKA test. HKA shows no devia1on from neutral expecta1ons (Supplementary Table 7) , and thus no excess of diversity and no evidence of long-term balancing selec1on that predates the expected coalescent 1me under neutrality. Rarely, the excess of intermediate--frequency alleles captured by Tajima's D and MWUhigh can also be the result of an ongoing par1al sweep (reviewed in [12] ) and by selec1on from standing varia1on [13] .
