However, the pathophysiology of this association remains uncertain. It is not known whether hyperglycemia changes the virulence of the infection, or if the virus modifies the glycemic metabolism. What we know is that diabetic patients are more susceptible to infection, and this can impact on glucose metabolism (4). DM is not just a disorder of glucose metabolism, but a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by multiple changes in lipid, carbohydrate and protein profiles (5). Such inflammatory processes are due to hyperglycemia which leads to increased synthesis of glycosylation end products (AGEs), activates macrophages and other cells of the immune system, increase oxidative stress and promote the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, besides stimulating the synthesis of adhesion molecules that facilitate inflammation in the tissues (5). The inflammatory process and its complications might provide a higher propensity to infections or a greater severity of these conditions. Another important issue is how this inflammatory and immune response occur in diabetic patients who acquire a viral infection, as well as whether the virus itself interferes with insulin secretion or the glycemic control.",

Nowadays this comorbidity poses a relevant threat to human health, and prospective well-designed studies to elucidate the biological mechanism and the best clinical management of this association are urgently needed.HomePhilipphilip.home@newcastle.ac.ukTranslational and Clinical Research Institute, The Medical School, Framlington Place, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE20 9HU, UKDear SirIt was very useful to see the review published in the journal on diabetes and COVID 19 infection [6]. In it you highlight that people with diabetes have a death rate perhaps around four times that of the background population, and I note that it has been suggested over 20-40 % of deaths in China/Wuhan were in people with diabetes [7,8], Clearly it is important to understand why.There will be some confounders here in the form of associations with other risk factors for dying with a Covid-19 infection, notably age and cardiovascular disease, but these cannot explain all the excess. We need to understand this better to mitigate the risk.It is reported that most of the deaths are occurring in the context of pneumonitis [7,8], and in particularly onset of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a condition in which excess fluid in the alveoli blocks gas exchange between air and blood.People with diabetes, and many with cardiovascular disease (CVD) without diabetes, have a very permeable vasculature, identified since the 1980s as albumin lead through the kidneys (micro- and macro-albuminuria), but even prior to that as a late blush over the retina with intravenous fluorescence marker injection [9]. This leaky vasculature is associated with vascular inflammation, metabolic syndrome, and steatohepatitis, as well as CVD per se.It would seem not too far a stretch, in the absence of further research as yet, to assume that prior enhancement of vascular permeability could account for the increased rate of ARDS and death in people with diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, and also some with CVD.Aside from further research I would suggest that those already with albuminuria (a routine yearly test for people with diabetes), those with higher liver enzyme markers (ALT), and perhaps those with diabetes associated dyslipidaemia (low HDL cholesterol) should take particular steps to self-isolate.It is unclear to me how fast vascular inflammation can be ameliorated by improved blood glucose control (nearly all glucose-lowering medications reduce microalbuminuria in time), but tight glucose control in infected persons with insulin would meanwhile seem sensible. Very poor glucose control is further known to interfere with leukocyte/lymphocyte function [10].Yours sincerely.Philip Home.Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, UK.References6GuptaR.GhoshA.SinghA.K.MisraA.Clinical considerations for patients with diabetes in times of COVID-19Diabetes Metabolic Syndr Clin Res Rev142020211e2127Joint Commission.

Chichester: John Wiley, 1997, 1231-1241.\nGuptaRiteshFortis CDOC Hospital, Chirag EnclaveRenin Angiotensin System Blockade and COVID-19 DiseaseDear editor,We recently published an article highlighting the special concerns while managing patients with diabetes in the times of COVID-19 pandemic11. There have been some concerns about the use of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs), which were not clarified in our publication12. We are summarising the current evidence in this regard and will try to arrive at a reasonable conclusion.In the absence of a vaccine and an antiviral drug for the COVID-19 infection, several therapeutic approaches are being studied. One such approach is the use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, namely ACE inhibitors and ARBs. On the other hand, some concern has been raised about the fact that patients on these agents might be at an increased risk of infection by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2).Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) is the receptor for SARS CoV-2 as well as other coronaviruses and is expressed in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells and endothelium. The S-glycoprotein on the surface of coronavirus binds to ACE2. This leads to a conformational change in the S-glycoprotein and allows proteolytic digestion by host cell proteases (TMPRSS2) ultimately leading to internalization of the virion13. Viral S-glycoprotein, TMPRSS2 and ACE-2 inhibition are potential targets of therapy and possibly vaccine development.As ACE-2 is essential to coronavirus infection, its blockade is thought to be beneficial in preventing/treating this infection. A retrospective analysis found reduced rates of death and endotracheal intubation in patients with viral pneumonia who were continued on ACE inhibitors14. Mice with coronavirus induced lung injury showed improvement when treated with losartan15. As far as CVID-19 infection is concerned, the data on RAS activation or the effect of its blockade is limited at present. Hypokalaemia could be a marker of RAS activation and high incidence of hypokalaemia has been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection16.Despite these small studies suggesting the benefit of drugs acting on RAS, there is some data, albeit scarce, from animal models and human studies that treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARB could cause up regulation of ACE217. Ibuprofen and thiazolidinediones have also been shown to do the same18\n,\n19. Increased expression of ACE2 could theoretically increase the risk of infection with SARS CoV-2. This could be a concern in people with diabetes who are at already elevated risk of infections because of many other factors. However, currently, there is no evidence to support this hypothesis. In view of lack of robust evidence for either benefit or harm, it is reasonable for patients to continue using ACE inhibitors and ARB, as recommended by European Society of Cardiology Council on Hypertension and European Society of Hypertension.20\n,\n21.References11GuptaR.GhoshA.SinghA.K.MisraA.Clinical considerations for patients with diabetes in times of COVID-19 epidemicDiabetes Metab Syndr1432020 Mar 102112123217217512FangL.KarakiulakisG.RothM.Are patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection?Lancet Respir Med2020 Mar 11S2213-2600(20)30116-3011813HoffmannM.Kleine-WeberH.Kr\u00fcgerN.M\u00fcllerM.DrostenC.P\u00f6hlmannS.The novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) uses the SARS-coronavirus receptor ACE2 and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for e ntry into target cellsbioRxiv20202020.01.31.92904214HenryC.ZaizafounM.StockE.GhamandeS.ArroligaA.C.WhiteH.D.Impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins on viral pneumoniaProc (Bayl Univ Med Cent).31420184194233094897015YangP.GuH.ZhaoZ.WangW.CaoB.LaiC.YangX.ZhangL.DuanY.ZhangS.ChenW.ZhenW.CaiM.PenningerJ.M.JiangC.WangX.Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediates influenza H7N9 virus-induced acute lung injurySci Rep4201470272539176716Chen D, Li X, Song Q, Hu C, Su F, DaiJ, Ye Y, HuangJ, Zhang X.
