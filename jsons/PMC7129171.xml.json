Consequently, global and national planning for pandemic diseases is grounded in the expectation that a novel respiratory infection is most likely to be responsible for the next pandemic or infectious disease emergency [1].",

Hospital-based transmission of respiratory infectious diseases of high consequence, such as influenza, can be minimised by limiting the part HCWs play as vectors or victims of disease. HCWs may continue to work with mild respiratory illness (presenteeism), which can be serious or life-threatening if transmitted to vulnerable patients, but they also may suffer serious effects from occupationally-acquired respiratory infections, leading to increased staff absenteeism, which will compromise patient care during epidemics. While policies and protocols for optimal use of PPE and other transmission-based precautions exist in the majority of healthcare facilities, HCW compliance with them is typically limited, particularly in non-outbreak situations or in the early stages before an outbreak is recognised [2], [3]. In particular, HCWs' use of protective masks when caring for patients with respiratory infections is an important and well-documented IPC measure [4]. Yet HCW use of protective masks, and PPE in general, during routine care is often suboptimal and can result in healthcare-associated acquisition of infection [5] (Table 2\n).",

Consistent routine use of protective masks, based on relevant clinical indications, is important in preventing or delaying transmission from an unrecognised initial/index case [7]. The appropriate use of PPE, including respiratory protection, and hand hygiene in routine care is critical to minimising pathogen transmission to staff and other patients; sub-optimal use exposes both HCWs and patients to infection. Compliance of HCWs with wearing a protective mask may be related to their perception of risk and their risk-taking behaviours. The existing IPC literature primarily focuses on this topic in the context of SARS or other pandemic respiratory diseases, with few papers investigating risk constructs for healthcare workers in routine care.",

We argue that the factors that lead to suboptimal use go far beyond knowledge and education, as well documented in other behaviours such as hand hygiene [8]. Interventions, and the research efforts used to generate evidence to support them, must take account of individuals' constructs and perceptions of risk and risk-taking behaviour. These perceptions are necessarily heterogeneous and vary between individuals and clinical settings. Therefore, an understanding of the perceptions and behaviours regarding PPE use in different contexts is needed to inform successful behaviour change interventions [9]. The importance and urgency of addressing suboptimal mask use by HCWs is, in our view, based on a range of interconnected reasons all of which are critical to global health and security.

These pandemics have resulted in deaths and disability of millions of people across the world, as well as causing social and economic disruption. Despite improvements in communicable disease prevention and control, including effective sanitation, vector control, vaccines, and the International Health Regulations developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) [10], the new, emerging infectious diseases continue to threaten the well-being and economic stability of society and impose a significant burden on healthcare. Although some infectious diseases, such as plague or smallpox, no longer present an active global pandemic threat, this century has seen both new and re-emerging infectious diseases give rise to widespread outbreaks. Of particular current concern is re-assortment of RNA in viruses such as influenza A which contributes to emerging pandemic influenza strains [11]. Furthermore, several zoonotic viral diseases that have infected humans through animal-to-human contact have also demonstrated human-to-human transmission, such as Nipah virus [12].",

[25] examined overall sickness absences including sick leave due to acute respiratory infection (ARI) for four distinct influenza periods between 2004 and including the 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic in Hong Kong. Results showed that the daily HCW absenteeism rate for ARI increased from the pre-pandemic baseline by 26.5% and 90.9% during the epidemic and pandemic periods respectively [24]. Similarly in Canada, researchers demonstrated a significant increase in the rate of sick hours between the pre-influenza and 2012/2013 influenza period with only 14% of staff having zero sick hours Productivity Losses Related to the Common Cold [26]. A study examining the effect of influenza vaccination on emergency department workers' absentee rates reported that 30% of vaccinated and 55% of non-vaccinated workers required sick leave for influenza-like illness [27], although significant absenteeism during the H1N1 influenza pandemic was not noted in the Australian emergency workforce [28]. Staff illness compromises the quality and safety of patient care by loss of continuity of care through the requirement to employ agency staff in place of regular staff, who may be unfamiliar with the specialism of the clinical setting [28]. Staff absenteeism during outbreaks of emerging or high consequence infectious diseases, may also be due to HCWs fear of acquiring the infection [29].",

In a study undertaken in a children's hospital in Philadelphia, 299 (55%) of medical staff who were surveyed, reported that they would work with significant respiratory symptoms, despite acknowledging the infection risk to their co-workers and patients [31]. In another study over 40% of US HCWs who were surveyed worked with symptoms of influenza-like illness [32]. Whilst it is important to avoid presenteeism, it may be occasionally unavoidable e.g. because of significant or specialised staff shortages. If so, the risk may be mitigated by appropriate mask use.

In a survey of healthcare workers in the US, 43% of doctors reported having received PPE training only as students (including clinical rotations) or not at all (c.f. 8% of nurses) [41]. Despite prior education, HCWs may not apply their knowledge to the workplace [42]. The method of training is therefore an important consideration for effective retention of knowledge and skills over time. Several studies argue for improving the evaluation and training of HCWs using PPE for infectious diseases and examining the effectiveness of various teaching approaches [43], [44]. The recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak instigated intensive PPE training around the world, with a focus on donning and doffing protocols to maximise HCW safety. Unsafe use of PPE has been blamed for some HCWs becoming infected with EVD or SARS; subsequently several research studies have reviewed the effectiveness of different training techniques for the safe donning and doffing of PPE [45]. These have included interactive online courses, and classroom teaching that incorporates fluorescent dye or harmless bacteriophages as surrogate markers of contamination [46]. Video-reflexive ethnography (VRE) has been used as an interventional methodology to improve IPC practices [47]. This method allows the HCW to view video footage of themselves making decisions around and subsequently using protective masks in every-day complex work. The clinicians can then reflect on their behaviour and suggest ways in which their own and colleagues' mask use can be optimised.",

During periods of high-risk for respiratory infectious disease, such as the annual influenza season or a novel influenza pandemic, health departments have, and may, encourage or mandate the use of a protective respiratory mask by the general public to minimise the transmission from symptomatic people to others [49]. In healthcare facility waiting rooms it is recommended that symptomatic patients be given a respiratory mask to wear to protect others as part of respiratory hygiene [49]. This social behaviour may alter the perception of risk for staff towards mask use in two ways, particularly in the emergency department. Firstly, HCWs may take a view that it is the patient's, not their own, responsibility to abide by these infection prevention measures and purposefully choose not to wear a mask on the basis of responsibility. Secondly, they may not perceive a risk of becoming infected if a patient is wearing a mask and so will not use one. There are several risks for HCWs adopting this behaviour. The patient may not wear the mask correctly or remove it at any time, especially if they are kept waiting for long periods, thus exposing other patients and HCWs. Additionally, the patient may not be able to tolerate a mask for long if unwell and will then remove it. Clinical examination may put the HCW at higher risk of exposure, even if the patient is wearing the mask correctly when they enter the room or cubicle and certain procedures, such as taking a swab for influenza testing, collection of an induced sputum specimen or intubation, require removal of the patient's mask.",

Staff reported that heavy workloads, lack of infection control facilities and distraction from their core business compromised the care of non-flu patients. Large numbers of patients requiring care will lead to bed shortages and hospital admission gridlock, probable loss of critical care beds which are blocked with long stay respiratory patients and the cancellation of routine surgical lists [59].

We argue that the value of such research would be its potential impact on the ongoing threat of emerging infectious diseases, workforce capability, capacity and educational needs, the financial costs of healthcare and outbreaks and the importance of social responsibility and appropriate legislation in planning for global security. Specifically, research is required to determine whether HCWs' perception of risk as it relates to the protection of themselves and others against transmission of infection influences their behaviour towards the use of a protective mask. There is also a need to determine the personal, professional and contextual factors that impact on HCWs' perceptions of risk and their use of protective masks for infectious diseases. An exploration of the practices and constructs of risk by HCWs will therefore provide valuable information to inform policy and pandemic planning.",

Furthermore, the consequences of poor mask use will be exacerbated during a widespread outbreak or pandemic of a novel infectious respiratory disease, when pharmacological agents or vaccination are unavailable. Minimising the transmission of respiratory disease through protective mask use leads to better outcomes for healthcare, workforce capability and economic stability. This paper has presented the background and justification for research into the attitudes and behaviour of HCWs towards protective mask use for respiratory infectious diseases during non-outbreak situations so as to optimise the use of masks when indicated in every day practice. The research can provide insight into perceptions of risk and risk-taking behaviour in respect of mask use for respiratory infectious diseases and help to bridge the gap between theory and practice (see Table 3\n).",
