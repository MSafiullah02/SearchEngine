Along with single-center reports of successful experience with rATG[19] and alemtuzumab,[24,25] the 2009 OPTN/SRTR annual report also documents increasing use of induction therapy with antibody preparations.[22] For example, the most common induction regimen[22] in 2008 was rATG, which was used in 34% of intestine recipients, followed by alemtuzumab (18%), muromonab CD3 (15%), and daclizumab (8%). The use of induction immunosuppression peaked in 2003 and stabilized to its current use in 60% of transplant recipients in 2008.[23] The immunosuppression regimen used for maintenance therapy prior to hospital discharge[22] in 2008 (figure 1) included tacrolimus plus corticosteroids in 55% of intestinal transplant recipients, tacrolimus plus mycophenolate and corticosteroids in 13%, tacrolimus plus mycophenolate in 11%, and tacrolimus alone in 11%; the maintenance regimen at 1-year post-transplant[22] for transplants carried out in 2007 (figure 2) was tacrolimus and corticosteroids in 47% of recipients and tacrolimus alone in 33%.\n\n\n",

            "text": "At CHP, 213 children received 235 intestine-containing allografts between May 1990 and December 2009. Mean age at transplantation was 5.1 \u00b1 5.3 years and mean follow-up time was 58.9 \u00b1 53.4 months. The incidence of acute rejection post-transplantation was 79% in the cyclophosphamide plus daclizumab cohort (n = 39), and has decreased to 68% in the rATG (n = 104) cohort and 36% in the alemtuzumab (n = 20) cohort, compared with 82% in the cohort in which no induction agent (n = 50) was used. Twenty-eight of the 213 (13%) subjects developed evidence of chronic rejection. The frequency of opportunistic infections and PTLD has also decreased over time. The incidence of tissue infection with cytomegalovirus was 26% in the cyclophosphamide plus daclizumab cohort, decreasing to 13% in the rATG plus alemtuzumab cohort. PTLD associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection also decreased from 23% in the cyclophosphamide plus daclizumab cohort to 11% in rATG cohort. This reduction is a coalescence of many contributing factors, such as improved postoperative infection prophylaxis, serial monitoring of cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus viral loads, pre-emptive therapy with antiviral drugs, and reduction in immunosuppression when titers are elevated.",

The transplant was performed regardless of the PRA titer if the crossmatch was negative. All transplanted patients responded to level 2 of therapy, and the mean pretreatment PRA titer in transplanted patients decreased from 66.2% to 25.5% at the end of treatment. Only one of six patients required level 4 treatment. This patient\u2019s PRA titers remained >90%, representing treatment failure. The authors concluded that intravenous immunoglobulin treatment can desensitize patients on a waiting list, as evidenced by a decrease in PRA titers, resulting in excellent post-transplant outcomes. Although there was no significant decrease in the incidence of acute rejection between the two cohorts with low and high PRA, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of corticosteroid-resistant rejections.",
