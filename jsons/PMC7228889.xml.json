The causative agent was soon identified as a new strain of coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on February 11, 2020. According to the early transmission dynamics, the mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with a 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days [2]. Common symptoms are fever, fatigue, myalgia, dry cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea [3]. Laboratory examination usually shows lymphopenia, elevated C-reactive protein and serum ferritin level, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [3]. Typical chest computed tomographic (CT) findings include bilateral ground-glass opacity and multifocal patchy consolidation [4]. Advanced age (>60), male sex, and underlying comorbidities (high blood pressure, diabetes, coronary heart disease, etc.) are risk factors for severe disease and death from SARS-Cov-2 infection [5, 6].",

It occurs most frequently in middle-aged and elderly men. Lesions and persistent inflammation often lead to fibrosis and can cause irreversible damage to surrounding tissues, resulting in IgG4-related autoimmune pancreatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, kidney disease, and other serious visceral injury and dysfunctions [7, 8]. Glucocorticoids are the first-line agent for all patients with active, untreated IgG4-RD unless contraindications to such treatment are present, and the combination of glucocorticoids and a steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent is needed for some patients [8]. Rituximab may be considered for failure of conventional therapy, recurrence during steroid reduction, steroid resistance or intolerance, rituximab may be considered [9, 10]. Long-term use of these medications may increase the risk of infection [11].",

We followed up 91 IgG4-RD patients in Hubei province, the epicenter of COVID-19 outbreak in China, and found two case of IgG4-RD patients had infected with COVID-19. Consistent with the reports, most of IgG4-RD patients were middle-aged to elderly men [7, 16]. In addition, the majority of the patients in our study had at least one chronic medical condition, such as hypertension and diabetes. The available data at present suggested that advanced age, male sex and chronic comorbidities are risk factors of mortality in patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection [17], [18], [19]. Therefore, theoretically IgG4-RD patients have a high risk of progressing to severe/critical COVID-19 once infected and thus need to be identified and properly treated as early as possible.",

The symptoms such as fever and cough and radiologic features were similar to other COVID-19 patients. However, the decline in white blood cells and lymphocytes in IgG4-RD patients may not be as typical and significant as other COVID-19 patients. The disease activity of IgG4-RD may also affect the recovery process of COVID-19. On the last on-site visit, patient 1 had a much lower IgG4-RD RI score than patient 2. Although patient 2 was younger, it took a longer time for him to recover from COVID-19. It is worth noting that neither of them developed primary disease relapse nor progressed to severe or critical condition of COVID-19 under the condition of continuous oral low-dose of glucocorticoids. This may be in part due to their prompt hospitalization, and it might also indicate that long-term oral low-dose of glucocorticoid may not be the risk factor for accelerating disease progression of COVID-19.",

There are many studies supporting the use of corticosteroids in patients with coronavirus infection [3, 20, 21]. However, high-dose corticosteroids may be associated with increased risks of secondary infections, long-term complications, and prolonged virus shedding in COVID-19 patients [22]. In fact, it has been reported that the duration of viral RNA clearance as detected in oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples was longer in glucocorticoid treatment group than that in non-glucocorticoid treatment group [23]. In our study, patient 2 took a long time for SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid to turn negative, which may implicated that the viral load in such patients may need to be monitored for a longer time after discharge. Besides, the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools may take a longer time compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs [23], it is better to test the viral RNA in stools or in combination with oropharyngeal swabs.",
