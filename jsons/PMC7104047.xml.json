Since entry into the cell is the first step for the initiation, dissemination, and maintenance of virus infection, blocking this process will have a significant inhibitory effect. Considering the vital roles in the initial steps of the viral infectious cycle such as recognition and attachment, envelope proteins have become the ideal targets for antiviral strategies development (Yi et al., 2016; Dinesh et al., 2017; Priya et al., 2018; de Wispelaere et al., 2018), among which, design of antiviral peptides (AVPs) has lately regained interest following pioneering advancements in technology (Chew et al., 2017). By using this approach, peptides derived from several viruses have been designed and exhibited significant self-inhibitory activity (Ho et al., 2006; Costin et al., 2010; Schmidt et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2012; Koehler et al., 2013; Spence et al., 2014).",

There is increasing evidence that WSSV envelope proteins play very important roles in virus-host interactions by forming protein complexes (Huang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2009; Lee and Chen, 2017). As the most abundant surface protein, the major protein VP28 can interact with many other proteins (Zhou et al., 2009; Yi et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012), and participate in formation of most known protein complexes (Zhou et al., 2009; Li et al., 2011), acting as a vital virulence factor in the initial phases of WSSV infection in shrimp (Sivakumar et al., 2016), therefore has been considered as an ideal target for WSSV controlling (Nguyen et al., 2014; Nilsen et al., 2017; Taengchaiyaphum et al., 2017; Taju et al., 2018).

Docking results showed that the peptide could bind with the core \u03b2-barrel of VP28 which protruded outside the envelope, and might interact with the host receptor or other envelop proteins, or form trimers, playing a role in virus entry by triggering membrane fusion between the virus and the host, so this peptide may act by interrupting this process. Antiviral assay results could support this point, only the peptide was used in the window period, it could provide protection; if it was degraded, or the shrimp was already infected, it could do nothing.",

Antimicrobial peptides are a group of membrane active peptides that disrupt the membrane integrity either by pore formation or through nonspecific membrane permeabilization (Lee et al., 2016; Avci et al., 2018). Similarly, this peptide functioning as an antimicrobial peptide also may bind to the similar proteins of used bacteria, which could be concluded from the docking results of the peptide and these proteins (Fig. 5\n).",
