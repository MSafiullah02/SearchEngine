There have been no reports, however, of consistent detection of viruses in MS central nervous system tissue. We probed MS and control brain with cDNA probes specific for human, murine, porcine, and bovine coronaviruses. We report the in situ hybridization detection of coronavirus RNA in 12 of 22 MS brain samples using cloned coronavirus cDNA probes. In addition, tissue was screened for coronavirus antigen by immunohistochemical methods; antigen was detected in two patients with rapidly progressive MS. Significant amounts of coronavirus antigen and RNA were observed in active demyelinating plaques from these two patients. These findings show that coronaviruses can infect the human central nervous system and raise the possibility that these viruses may contribute to the pathogenesis of MS in some patients. sclerosis center, D~~~ 7 5 0 0~~, 501 E~~ Hapden A,,~, ~~~l wood, cO 801 CO; the tDepartment",

A popular theory proposes that an exogenous stimulus initiates an immune response against endogenous CNS proteins, possibly myelin structural proteins. However, damage to the CNS as the result of an immune response to a chronic low-grade CNS infection has never been ruled out. Therefore, demyelinating lesions in MS may represent the final direct or indirect immunopathological reaction to an infectious agent. Supporting this hypothesis are epidemiological studies that strongly implicate an environmental factor in the development of MS [ 11.",

Difficulties in detecting and isolating a pathogen arise primarily from the efficiency with which the immune system works. In models of viral pathogenesis, the area of acute early inflammation is most likely to yield positive results because older lesions may have been cleared of the inciting agent. Therefore, we initially screened multiple white matter plaque and nonplaque regions by in situ hybridization using randcimly primed \"Slabeled complement D N A (cDNA) probes derived from genomic coronavirus RNA. Total genomic probes increase the likelihood of detection of closely-related coronaviruses. All coronavirus-positive tissue sections and selected control specimens were then further analyzed by in situ hybridization using all cloned cDNA probes specific for the prototypic coronaviruses from two of the three major coronavirus groups. Noncoronavirus probes were used as well to control for nonspecificity of the hybridization procedure. In each probe experiment, subjacent sections were used from the positive tissue block. In addition, coronavirus-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antisera were used to probe for virus antigen by immunohistochemistry in subjacent sections.",

However, accumulating data suggest that coronaviruses may infect human CNS tissue and that these viruses may differ from the prototypical upper respiratory human coronaviruses 117, 22, 23, [25] [26] [27] . The results presented herein support the contention that coronaviruses are capable of infecting human CNS. Surprisingly, of the 12 positive patient samples identified with the murine-specific in situ probe, only 5 were positive with the HCV OC43 probe. In addition, the murine-specific probe produced stronger hybridization signal in these 5 samples compared to the HCV OC43 probe. This finding suggests that the coronavirus detected in MS tissue may be more closely related to the prototypical murine coronavirus in the 3' end of the genome, or it may be a human-murine recombinant coronavirus.",

By in situ hybridization, however, the H C V OC43 probe weakly hybridized to MHV A59-infected cells, whereas the BCV probe did not. The slight degree of sequence divergence between HCV OC43 and BCV may account for this result, but differences in hybridization conditions such as probe concentrations or specific activities may also be responsible for the lack of hybridization of the BCV clone to the tissues and MHV A59-infected cells.",

The low percentage of coronavirus RNA-containing cells is exemplified by the fact that although 52%, of the patients with MS were positive, only 11% of the total sections examined were positive (see Results section). This finding may explain the previously reported negative dot-blot hybridization study for HCV OC43 sequences in MS tissue [28). The dot-blot hybridization technique is considerably less sensitive than in situ hybridization when attempting to detect a very low percentage of positive cells in a total cell population.",

This finding clearly indicates that the 3' end of the genome is more murine-like. Interestingly, the coronavirus EWA and antigen-positive cells in the two patients with rapidly progressive MS appear to be foamy macrophages, which have a similar appearance to those seen in acute plaques in the rat model of MHV JHM-induced demyelination {29] . Although others have detected viral nucleic acid by in situ hybridization in MS tissue C301, none have reported detecting the corresponding viral antigen. Our study is unique in this regard.",

The presence of macrophages in a plaque does not necessarily indicate that viral products will be found; this finding was observed for the two patients shown in Figures 1 and 2 . Some plaques containing macrophages contained abundant coronavirus RNA whereas others did not, which implies a timing factor for detection of the viral RNA. This factor was also evident in our primate model of coronavirus demyelination [34}, where the immune system cleared detectable virus from some areas while other areas retained viral RNA, antigen, or both. An alternative explanation for finding coronavirus RNA and antigen in macrophages is that these cells can be nonspecifically sequestered in the CNS after a systemic infection; this mechanism is currently under investigation in a prospective study of patients with MS and in the primate system. This study indicates that coronaviruses with similarities to murine coronaviruses are capable of infecting humans and thus may represent a previously unidentified human pathogen. The data presented herein do not establish coronavirus as an etiological agent for MS, but they do indicate that coronaviruses are present in the human CNS and are preferentially detected in MS tissue. Possibly, coronaviruses are not involved in pathogenesis; perhaps patients with MS are merely susceptible to CNS infection after onset of the disease.",

Once within the human CNS, coronaviruses may have a role in the induction or maintenance of demyelination, or both, by one or more mechanisms. In our primate studies, we have demonstrated that MHV JHM and the putative MS isolate coronavirus SD can infect, disseminate, and cause demyelination [34). Studies of coronavirus infection of rodent CNS {9, 12, 351 show that demyelination can be due to direct viral infection and lysis of oligodendrocytes {36]. However, viral persistence in a noncytolytic state appears to be critical to the mechanisms of chronic demyelination 12, 36, 373; autoimmune reactivity toward CNS proteins may cause demyelination during persistent MHV JHM infection {ll,",
