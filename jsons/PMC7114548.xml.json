The largest ORFs ORF1a and ORF1ab encode for the polyprotein replicases 1a and 1ab mainly involving in the SARS-CoV replication, as cleaved in cis and in trans by ORF1a-encoded papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro). PLpro, a de-ubiquitinating/de-ISGylating enzyme (Barretto et al., 2005, Ratia et al., 2006), has the antagonistic activities of Type I interferon (IFN) via blocking IRF-3 and ERK1 phosphorylation, preventing the I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, and de-ubiquitinating the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex (Li et al., 2011, Frieman et al., 2009, Sun et al., 2012). Recently, PLpro shows the inhibitory effect on Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) mediated cytokine production through removing Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains of TRAF3 and TRAF6 (Li et al., 2016a).",

Among SARS-CoV proteins, the nucleocapsid induces a Smad3-dependent induction of TGF-\u03b21 expression (Zhao et al., 2008); spike protein stimulates the IL-8 up-regulation in lung cells (Chang et al., 2004); NSP1 provokes the expression of CCL5, CXVL10, and CCL3 (Law et al., 2007); PLpro elavates the production of TGF-\u03b21 and pro-fibrotic markers via ubiquitin proteasome, p38 MAPK, and ERK1/2-mediated signaling (Li et al., 2012). Recently, SARS-CoV PLpro notably initiates ROS/p38 MAPK/STAT3 pathway to activate Egr-1 dependent expression of TSP-1, TGF-\u03b21 and vimentin in vitro and in vivo (Li et al., 2016b).

In the canonical Smad signalling pathway, TGF-\u03b21 interacts with the TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor, activates receptor-regulated Smads (Smad2 and Smad3) complexed with Smad4, and then translocate to the nucleus to synthesize TGF-\u03b21-induced transcriptional genes like Type I collagen (Leask and Abraham, 2004, Kubiczkova et al., 2012). In non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways, TGF-\u03b21 activates MAPKs (Erk, JNK and p38 MAPK), Rho-like GTPases (RhoA, Rac and Cdc42), PI3K/AKT, WNT/\u03b2-catenin, or Ca2+ signaling cascades in TGF-\u03b21-induced transcriptional response (Zhang, 2009). The activation of p38 MAPK is responsible for TGF-\u03b2-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of mouse mammary gland epithelial cells under a receptor independent of receptor-mediated Smad activation (Yu et al., 2002). The activation of RhoA in TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT response is also independent of Smad2 and/or Smad3 (Bhowmick et al., 2001).",

This study assesses possible effects and mechanisms of SARS-CoV PLpro-induced TGF-\u03b21 upregulation on the expression of Type I collagen. The induction ability of SARS-CoV PLpro on in vitro and in vivo expression of Type I collagen was characterized.

The relationship between TGF-\u03b2 upregulation and the mechanism of Type I collagen induction by PLpro was validated by the specific inhibitors of TGF-\u03b2 receptor kinase, p38 MAPK and STAT6.",

Moreover, SMAD7 was detected in the nucleus of both transfected cells (Fig. 4B).

            "text": "Non-Smad pathways in TGF-\u03b21 signaling include MAP kinase, Rho-like GTPase, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT pathways (Zhang, 2009). To examine the possible pathways involved in TGF-\u03b21-dependent up-regulation of Type I collagen by SARS-CoV PLpro, the profiles of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in transfected cells with vector control and pSARS-PLpro were determined using immune-precipitation and nanoLC\u2013MS/MS. Interestingly, several proteins of the Ras GTPase family were identified (Table 1\n), in which indicated the ubiquitination of these Ras family GTPase proteins was influenced by SARS-CoV PLpro. Fig. 5\nA represented the mass spectrum of Rac1 identified by LC\u2013MS/MS. Rac1, a Rho GTPase, had an increase of the ubiquitination in PLpro-expressing cells compared to vector control cells. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting assays revealed the elevation of Rac1 mRNA and protein expression in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro compared to vector control (Fig. 5B and C). Rho GTPases were identified in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling through activation of Jak/STAT and modulated STAT-dependent gene expression (Pelletier et al., 2003). In addition, STAT-6-dependent collagen production has been demonstrated in human skin fibroblasts and mouse airway fibroblasts in response to bovine milk and platelet-derived growth factor, respectively (Kippenberger et al., 2015, Lu et al., 2014). For analyzing the correlation between PLpro-induced Rac1 up-regulation and STAT6 activation, co-transfection of pcDNA3.1 or pSARS-PLpro plus the Rac1 mutant plasmid pMX-IG-Rac1 T17N was performed, and the STAT6 activation in co-transfected cells was measured using immunofluorescence staining with anti-STAT6 and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. PLpro expression caused the STAT6 expression and induced the translation of STAT6 in the nucleus. Remarkably, the Rac1 mutant slightly affected the STAT6 up-regulation by PLpro, but significantly reduced PLpro-induced STAT6 nuclear translocation (Fig. 5D). Later, the functional activity of STAT6 in TGF-\u03b21-dependent collagen up-regulation was further characterized in vector control and PLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 6, Fig. 7\n). Nuclear localization and phosphorylation of STAT6 was observed in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro, but not vector control cells (Figs. 6 and 7 A). Importantly, SB-431542, a selective TGF-\u03b2R inhibitor, significantly reduced the entry of STAT6 in the nucleus of PLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 6). The result indicated that Rho GTPases/STAT6 was responsible for one of non-SMAD pathways in SARS PLpro-induced TGF-\u03b21 signals. Furthermore, a STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499 markedly suppressed TGF-\u03b21-dependent collagen expression in PLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 7). The results demonstrated that STAT6 activation was required for SARS PLpro-induced TGF-\u03b21-dependent production of Type I collagen.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV PLpro has been demonstrated to trigger the TGF-\u03b21 production in human promonocytes, human lung epithelial cells, and pulmonary tissues in mouse models (Li et al., 2012, Li et al., 2016b). SARS-CoV PLpro induced the ROS-mediated p38 MAPK and STAT3 activation of Egr-1 expression, in which Egr-1 specifically bound to the TGF-\u03b21 promoter region between \u2212175 to \u221260, resulting in the increase of TGF-\u03b21 production. This study indicated that SARS-CoV PLpro stimulated the production of Type I collagen in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). SARS-CoV PLpro-induced collagen deposition in pulmonary tissues was associated with lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis in mice injected with pSARS-PLpro (Fig. 3). The specific inhibitor for TGF-\u03b2 receptor, SB-431542, blocked the up-regulation of Type I collagen in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro. Moreover, the inhibitors for p38 MAPK and STAT3 that involved in Egr-1-dependent TGF-\u03b21 production significantly reduced the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and Type I collagen. Overall, the results revealed that SARS-CoV PLpro elicited TGF-\u03b21-dependent up-regulation of Type I collagen. TGF-\u03b21-dependent profibrotic response was considered as the crucial character in SARS-CoV PLpro-induced pathogenesis. An elevated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TGF-\u03b21 was detected in SARS-CoV-infected cells in autopsy tissues from died SARS patients (He et al., 2006), in which implied the association of pro-inflammatory cytokines with the severity and mortality of SARS. The increase of serum TGF-\u03b21 concentration during the early phase of SARS could be associated with lung infiltration (Beijing Group of National Research Project for SARS, 2003). Meanwhile, the decrease of serum TGF-\u03b21 concentration markedly lowered in the severity of SARS patients (Zhang et al., 2004).",

            "text": "In canonical pathway, TGF-\u03b21interacts with type I and II TGF-\u03b2 receptors and causes the activation of a serine/threonine kinase domain in TGF-\u03b2 receptors and the recruitment and phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3. The phosphorylated SMAD2/3 complexed with SMAD4 was trans-localized into nucleus to regulate the target gene expression (Kubiczkova et al., 2012). Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that SMAD3 was predominant in cytoplasmic, but not in the nucleus in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro compared to vector control (Fig. 4), revealing that canonical Smad-dependent signaling pathway was not involved in PLpro-induced TGF-\u03b21-dependent up-regulation of Type I collagen. TGF-\u03b2 also activates non-canonical non-SMAD pathways, including MAPKs (ERK1/ERK2, JNK and p38), PI3K kinases, AKT/PKB, mTOR, and Rho-like GTPase family proteins (Ras, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) (Zhang, 2009, Kubiczkova et al., 2012). Particularly, activation of RhoA pathway was required for TGF-\u03b2-mediated process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal trans-differentiaion in a dominant-negative Smad3 cells (Bhowmick et al., 2001). In addition, Rac1 activation promoted TGF-\u03b2-dependent collagen expression in mesangial cells (Hubchak et al., 2009). LC\u2013MS/MS analysis demonstrated that SARS-CoV PLpro influenced the ubiquitination status of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), Ras GTPase-activating-like protein IQGAP1, Ras-related protein Rab (Rab5C), putative Ras-related protein Rab (Rab1C), and Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein (G3BP1) (Table 1). Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting assays indicated the increased expression of Rac1 in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro compared to vector control (Fig. 5). Since activation of Jak/STAT pathway in a Rac-dependent manner was identified in response to the agonist of protein-coupled receptors (Pelletier et al., 2003), STAT-dependent signals were investigated in this study. The TGF-\u03b2RI inhibitor SB-431542 significantly attenuated the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of STAT6 in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro (Fig. 6). Meanwhile, the STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499 meaningfully reduced TGF-\u03b21-dependent up-regulation of Type I collagen in PLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 7). The results indicated that STAT6 activation was required for PLpro-induced TGF-\u03b21-dependent expression of Type I collagen in human lung epithelial cells and mouse lung tissues. The result was accordant with the previous reports in that STAT6-dependent collagen production has been demonstrated in human skin fibroblasts and mouse airway fibroblasts (Kippenberger et al., 2015, Lu et al., 2014). SARS-CoV PLpro affected on the ubiquitination and expression profile of Rho-like GTPase family proteins that could link with the activation of STAT6 signaling in TGF-\u03b21-dependent collagen expression, in which suggested that a new GTPase proteins/STAT6 pathway might play a critical role in TGF-\u03b21-dependent collagen production in PLpro-expressing cells.",
