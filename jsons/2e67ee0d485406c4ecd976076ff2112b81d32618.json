A limited set of algorithms exists for estimating the rate of nucleotide substitution and inferring phylogenetic trees from such data. The authors here present a new method, Tree and Rate Estimation by Local Evaluation (TREBLE) that robustly calculates the rate of nucleotide substitution and phylogeny with several orders of magnitude improvement in computational time. Methods: For the basis of its rate estimation TREBLE novelly utilizes a geometric interpretation of the molecular clock assumption to deduce a local estimate of the rate of nucleotide substitution for triplets of dated sequences. Averaging the triplet estimates via a variance weighting yields a global estimate of the rate. From this value, an iterative refinement procedure relying on statistical properties of the triplets then generates a final estimate of the global rate of nucleotide substitution. The estimated global rate is then utilized to find the tree from the pairwise distance matrix via an UPGMA-like algorithm. Results: Simulation studies show that TREBLE estimates the rate of nucleotide substitution with point estimates comparable with the best of available methods. Confidence intervals are comparable with that of BEAST. TREBLE's phylogenetic reconstruction is significantly improved over the other distance matrix method but not as accurate as the Bayesian algorithm. Compared with three other algorithms, TREBLE reduces computational time by a minimum factor of 3000. Relative to the algorithm with the most accurate estimates for the rate of nucleotide substitution (i.e. BEAST), TREBLE is over 10 000 times more computationally efficient.",

Generally, the MCA provides an explicit functional or statistical relationship between time and the frequency of nucleotide alterations (Felsenstein, 2004) . Most commonly the association is assumed to be constant, as it is in Tree and Rate Estimation By Local Evalutation (TREBLE). Recently several programs including BEAST [V1.3, (Drummond et al., 2002) and r8s (Sanderson, 2003) ] have implemented capacities to estimate the rate of nucleotide substitution under a relaxed molecular clock model via the assumption of a prior distribution of rates along branches.

Using triplets of sequences, TREBLE calculates the appropriate topology for the set. As the sampling times are known, the topology enforces specific ratios between the pairwise distances among the sequences that are then used to calculate the rate of nucleotide substitution for that set. Using this solution, the probability of a misspecified topology is calculated and only those triplets above a given threshold are included for further calculation. A variance weighting is then used to integrate these local calculations into a global estimate of the rate of substitution. Finally, a bootstrap is applied to produce confidence intervals on the estimate. The computational efficiency of the algorithm results from the use of rate estimates derived from heterochronous triplets of sequences and the corresponding absence of other costly parameter estimations.",

The first sort of error is inherent to the process under observation. Alignment uncertainty is left untreated for the purposes of this paper. TREBLE attempts to increase the accuracy of the estimates by limiting the remaining forms of error.

Following Equation (8) below, the statistical fluctuations are now on the same order as the rate estimates. In the second data set, 9 trees of 40 taxa were randomly generated with approximately half of the tree simulated under one rate value and the remaining half under another value. One value was always 3.0 \u00b7 10 \u00c04 substitutions per site per unit time (s/s/ut). The other value ranged discretely over 3.3 \u00b7 10 \u00c04 , 3.6 \u00b7 10 \u00c04 and 3.9 \u00b7 10 \u00c04 s/s/ut. No tree was evenly split between the two rates.

As the difference between the rate of the two partitions increases, so too does this bias. This is a product of noise threshold filter.",

The imposition of the noise threshold and the corresponding bias in non-clock-like evolutionary situations can be alleviated by setting a \u00bc 0.5. In this situation, TREBLE does produce a true zeroth-order approximation of the system, averaging the sampled triplets evenly over the tree without bias. However, the variance on these estimates increases noticeably. It is difficult for us to quantify this increase, as it varies for different distributions of the substitution rate across the tree. For comparison, in the case of the strict molecular clock simulations for trees with 100 taxa the sampled variance grows from 6.5 to 12%. In the case of the Dengue data presented above, varying the values of a had <5% effect on the rate point estimate.",

Hence, it is the heterogeneity of time sampling coupled with the MCA that allows this increase in accuracy and computational speed by trading robust local calculations for costly and inefficient parameter estimations.
