It is known that microorganisms such as bacteria, virus and fungi create and aggravate problems in hospitals and other environments by transmitting diseases and infections through clothing, bedding etc. Patients in hospitals are more prone to infection and the hospital acquired infections are among the top ten leading causes of death1. In spite of a great deal of research, clinicians are still facing problems with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MRSSA) bacteria in hospitals. When antibiotics are used incorrectly (for example, to treat colds and flu) and too frequently, bacteria will adapt and change to prevent being destroyed. Bacteria are antibiotic resistant when an antibiotic can no longer kill them. It may be noted that bacteria are usually active at pH 7.0-8.0 and fungi at 4.0-6.5. Fungal growth on textile materials is more rapid at RH greater than 80%2. Thus microorganisms exist in abundant quantities on textile materials and propagate diseases and infections and also cause damage to fibres under normal usage and storage conditions.",

            "text": "Infection control is a growing problem in places where hygiene is required and particularly in hospitals. Traditional muslin materials have been replaced by barrier materials in hospitals in the developed countries. Most of the clothing and garments used to protect cross infections from patient to patient and patient to medical personnel possess barrier properties that resist not only the entry of blood and liquids but also microorganisms. Such hospital garments, for example surgical gowns, gloves and drapes are not comfortable to wear for a long periods due to barrier properties. The performance of hospital textiles, thus, demands a balance between barrier and comfort properties. Initially cotton was mostly used in gowns and drapes and now polyester and polypropylene fibres dominate in most of hospital textiles. Rutala et al3 and Patel et al4 have reviewed the single use and reusable gowns and drapes in hospitals. The efficiency of the gowns in protecting cross infections has not been scientifically studied. However it has been found that higher barrier properties against microorganisms could be achieved in the surgical gowns that possess higher fabric repellency and smaller pore size5. Bacterial contamination in fabric stethoscope covers represents a potential infection control problem because they are used for prolonged periods and seldom laundered6. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, USA has established that there is limited clinical data to understand the relationship between the properties of gowns and drapes and Surgical Site Infections (SSI) risk7.",

Typically these garments are used as gowns, laboratory coats, coveralls, headwear, footwear and facial protection. The gowns are designed either single layer or reinforced double and mlltilayer depending on the level of protection in hospital environments such as operating rooms, post operative blocks and bedding areas. A single layer gown could be a highly repellent fabric intented for use where minimal fluid is present. Reinforced and multilayer gowns are intended for use in the areas where high level of protection is required. A highly protective three layer gown consists of a tough outer layer that resists abrasion and puncture, a middle layer provides resistance to fluid penetration and inner is a soft layer which adds comfort in addition to protection. The pore size of the gowns is designed to prevent the penetration of microorganisms but allows gaseous exchange. Impervious gowns prevent strike-through during fluid intensive procedures. Drapes are designed to prevent hospital-acquired infections, and are for single or multiple uses. Single use and reusable gowns and drapes are usually made from cotton, polyester, polypropylene and their blends and are widely available in Europe.

The directive consists of three parts in which part I (EN13795) was published in December 2002 and addressed the various performance characteristics required for surgical gowns, drapes and clean air suits to prevent transmission of infective agents between patients and clinicians during surgical procedures. Parts II and III are expected to be released in due course, and are expected to contain physical test methods and performance requirements respectively. In addition the EEC is funding a research programme named \u2018BIOBAR\u2019 with the aim to develop and validate test methods and classification systems for the assessment of barrier properties of materials against biological hazards, encountered in both occupational safety and in hospital situations. BIOBAR is not related to the CEN/TC 205/WG14 work, even though the results of their research will be highly relevant to that committee. At present the following standard test methods, in addition to common strength tests (tensile, tear and bursting), comfort and absorbency, are normally carried out on hospital protective textiles.",

            "text": "With a view to develop antimicrobial textile materials, considerable research has been carried out by making use of organic and inorganic compounds, antibiotics, heterocyclics, quaternary ammonium compounds and so on. The biocidal properties of silver compounds have been known for thousands of years, and have been increasingly used nowadays to impart antibacterial properties to textile materials for hospital use12. Vigo et al13\u201315 have carried out several studies ranging from fundamental aspects to development of antimicribial fabrics. Antibacterial polyester fabrics have been developed by imbuing antibacterial agents into the structure of fibres rather than depositing on their surface for longer durability and effect16. It is stated that the efficacy of the finished fabric to arrest the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli is about 5 times higher than the conventional materials. A synergistic system of formulation comprising of inorganic chemicals involving a metal salt of a monocarboxylic acid, a carbamic acid derivative, a chealating agent, a boron compound, a dimethylene siloxane derivative and an alkane polymer has been proved to serve as an effective antimicrobial agent in arresting the growth of several bacteria (Gram positive and Gram negative), fungi and mildew17,18. Hospital trials showed a dramatic decrease in bacteria, fungi and mildew growth in treated fabrics. The treatment also prevents the deterioration of fabrics by microorganisms. Chitosan treatment on cotton renders antimicrobial activity. Chitosan treated cotton fabric showed a high reduction rate in the number of colonies19. Fabrics made from viscose fibres containing polysilicic acid (Visil) and aluminium silicate (Visil AP) have been given urea peroxide treatment to make them antibacterial as well as deodorant20. Instead of treating the surface of the fabrics with polymer coating, antibacterial additives have been imbedded into the fabric's polymer fibres for the production of antibacterial gowns21. Holme22 has recently reviewed the current commercial antimicrobial finishes. A nonwoven composite barrier fabric comprising of a microporous thermoplastic film thermally bonded to layers of spunlaid nonwoven polyolefin has been made to resist the penetration by blood-born pathogenic organisms23. Besides the fabric possesses microporous structure that allows air and water vapour to pass through but not liquids, and is of immense benefit especially in operating theatre protective clothing and cover sheets. It must be stressed that the operating theatre fabrics should meet three primary requirements such as non-transmission of fluids and microorganisms, high absorbency and air and vapour permeability or breathability24. In addition to antibacterial materials, special bedding products that are impermeable to dust mites have also been developed25.",
