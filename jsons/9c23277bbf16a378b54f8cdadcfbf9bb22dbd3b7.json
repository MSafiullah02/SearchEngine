Firstly, the caseload in neurosurgery has shifted to provide primarily an emergency service while elective neurosurgery has been suspended. This clinical prioritisation is partly to ration intensive care beds and resources in the form of staff and equipment, vital in supporting patients who deteriorate from respiratory compromise associated with COVID-19. It is also vital in reducing unnecessary viral exposure to at-risk cohorts. This redistribution of hospital resources to combat COVID-19 has reshaped neurosurgical decision-making with respect to both the timing and clinical thresholds of decisions to transfer emergent cases. Finally, the workforce has been depleted in part due to redeployment however many units have adapted rotations to minimise the workforce exposedrunning a skeletal service with reserve teams in place in case of sickness. Such local policies have also been influenced by national guidance to minimise the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgical service delivery.",

Trainees may find this method daunting -obtaining sufficient clinical information to make safe management decisions. Communication via telemedicine is not a skill taught in medical school. This method of consultation may require a certain degree of creativity and imagination, and force us to sharpen our communication skills. Without conventional methods of examining the patient directly, trainees may be forced to explore other methods of eliciting neurological deficits. For example, to examine the motor system, patients may be able to demonstrate strength by testing myotomes with household items or dumbbells. To examine the sensory system, a family member, under the instruction of the consulting neurosurgeon, may examine the patient using household items such as cotton or a blunt sewing needle. These methods may not be as accurate as a conventional examination; however, should elicit sufficient information to allow trainees to make safe interim clinical decisions and illicit any concern for rapidly deteriorating neurological conditions. With the patient's permission, these consultations can also be recorded and discussed with a senior colleague at a later date.",

Much like neurosurgery, medicine is ever changing; as such, many methods of medical management will have changed since trainees completed their ICU rotations.

As trainees, we are ultimately a product of our training and experience. We must acknowledge the potential impact on training in all specialities, not just neurosurgery. A proposed extension of training to counter a reduction in operative cases and time spent in redeployment would seem reasonable, although this would come at a cost. For a highly practical specialty, there seems no reasonable alternative to make up for the shortcomings. Simply ignoring this hiatus in training does not do justice to the importance of practical experience in what is considered to be a highly technical speciality. As described in this article, there exists a myriad of training opportunities that have the potential to positively contribute towards a trainee's development as a neurosurgeon. During this difficult time, every effort must be made to grasp training opportunities where possible. This pandemic will have a lasting impact on training. Once we come through this crisis, we will need to work in unison to address the long-term threats to training appropriately. Whether consciously or subconsciously, our experiences within the current crisis will shape the \"COVID -19 generation\" of neurosurgical trainees.",
