Based on the influenza A/H1N1/2009 sequences a conserved sequence was submitted to Primer Express Version 3.0 (Applied Biosystems). The chosen primers and probe (see Table 1\n) amplify a 73-bp amplicon and bioinformatics analysis using BLAST and Clustal alignments showed no significant homology to human or other known influenza A gene sequences (Fig. 1\n). The highest homology is 91% to classical swine flu, e.g. A/swine/England/WVL15/1997(H1N1). With this strain there were 4 mismatches in the probe sequence, which would be expected to prevent hybridisation although this was not experimentally tested. In addition we would not expect to be screening humans infected with classical swine flu strains. The chosen primers and probe do not span any of the variable antigenic sites minimising the possibility of point mutations occurring (Abed et al., 2002).",

Multiplexing was shown to have no effect on the performance of the individual test components and, because the assay utilised the qiagen quantifast multiplex RT-PCR kit, the presence of internal control within the samples did not compete with the other diagnostic components.",

In addition, the N1 assay did not detect as positive any of the influenza A, subtype H5N1 viruses. Close homology was observed between amplicon and classical swine influenza A (H1N1). The assay was not assessed against this virus and therefore we cannot be sure as to whether the test will detect this virus. However, four mismatches in the probe were observed which may reduce the likelihood of detecting this virus.",
