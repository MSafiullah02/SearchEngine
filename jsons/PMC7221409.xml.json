It results primarily from embolus or thrombosis for ischemic stroke and hypertension for hemorrhagic stroke, respectively [1]. In 2016, there were 5.5 million deaths and 116.4 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) owed to stroke [2]. As reported, the impact of stroke on the Chinese population is more severe compared to average global levels, and the prevalence of stroke continues to surpass that of ischemic heart disease [3], [4]. Intravenous alteplase (rtPA) is an effective treatment for ischemic stroke, and conservative treatment or surgical treatment may be needed for hemorrhagic stroke [5], [6]. Though treatments have been developed to decline stroke mortality rates, the global burden of stroke remains substantial and it is increasing as populations continue to age.",

Immunodepression after stroke, pulmonary aspiration and bacterial infections are major causes of SAP [13], [14]. Many studies have already presented evidence that indicates age, obesity, bilateral lesions, severe neurological deficit, congestive heart failure, dysarthria and dysphagia are risk factors for pulmonary infection among those experiencing acute cerebral infarction [15], [16], [17].

Lower BI scores, with basic lung diseases, trachea ventilation, tube feeding, and hypoproteinemia are concerned to be independent risk factors for pneumonia. No statistical significance was observed for age, gender, type of stroke, diabetes, and hypertension. Among the patients with pneumonia, gram-negative bacilli were the most common, followed by Gram-positive bacilli and fungi. Gram-negative bacteria are common to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; Gram-positive bacteria are more common to Staphylococcus aureus; fungi are mainly Candida albicans. The results suggested that the resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to monocyclic aztreonam was the highest, about 30.77%, and it was sensitive to ceftazidime and cefoperazone/sulbactam, but no resistance to colistin and amikacin. Acinetobacter baumannii has a high resistance rate to carbapenems, penicillins, cephalosporins, and aminoglycoside antibacterials, up to 85.71%, and was sensitive to colistin and tigecycline. The resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim is 57.14%, and the resistance rates to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones are more than 40%; to cefoxitin sodium, colistin, tigecycline, Cefoperazone and sulbactam are not resistant.",

            "text": "The BI score has been used as a nursing dependency assessment in many fields, such as rehabilitation after stroke, after cardiovascular disease, after joint surgery, and Parkinson's disease [26], [27], [28], [29]. Usually, a lower BI score means higher nursing dependence. As it reported, a BI score \u226480 is associated with a higher mortality in patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and can be a useful tool to predict CAP mortality in general population [30]. Besides, negative correlation was found between BI scores and the existence of pneumonia complications in acute stroke patients [31]. The result of this study is consistent with previous reports, but no statistical significance was observed between moderate or mild nursing dependency and non-nursing dependency. Researches presented that chronic respiratory diseases, such as COPD and bronchiectasis increase pneumonia risk [24]. Imbalance of airway microbial flora in patients with underlying lung diseases and possible long-term use of inhaled corticosteriod may the causes of pneumonia [32], [33], [34]. In this study, the use of hormones and immunosuppressants were also observed as possible risk factors, but they did not show statistical significance, probably because of the limited number of cases (n=10) in which the drugs were used in the study subjects. It may also be related to the type of medication and the course of treatment. Some stroke patients may require continuous tracheal ventilation due to the damage of respiratory center. Studies have reported that about 18% of tracheal ventilation patients develop pneumonia, and pneumonia was associated with prolonged ventilation [35]. Although tracheotomy can lead to pneumonia, some studies have reported that if patients have to tracheal ventilation, it can reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia both in children and old patients [36], [37]. Dysphagia is a common symptom seen in stroke patients. In order to provide nutritional support, dysphagic patients after stroke usually need an appropriate feeding method, indwelling nasogastric tubes are routinely used. But it was reported that prolonged use of nasogastric tube feeding may have negative effects, which is also confirmed in the results of this study, since the the risk of aspiration or bacterial calibration may increase with prolonged nasogastric tube feeding [38]. Intensive evaluation of dysphagia and removal of the nasogastric tube in the early stages of stroke might reduce pneumonia incidence and mortality [39]. Hypoalbuminemia is common in hospitalized patients and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Researches have suggested that hypoproteinemia leads to height of inflammatory factors and can be used as a risk factor for predicting mortality for acute diseases [40]. The results of this study presented that hypoalbuminemia increases the risk of pneumonia by 3.97 times, this may be related to dysphagia and the decrease of living ability, or infection in the convalescent period of stroke, which may lead to the lack of nutrition supply or excessive albumin consumption, while much remains to be studied.",

In addition, since the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of 2019, which has caused infections and deaths of millions of people worldwide, the new coronavirus infection appears to be another major threat to human health [41]. Unlike viral pneumonia, refractory bacterial pneumonia is mostly caused by drug-resistant bacteria, and the infectivity is not as strong as viral pneumonia. The treatment of bacterial pneumonia still depends on powerful antibacterial drugs, while the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia has not yet found special drugs, and the focus of prevention and treatment is to reduce contact transmission and rely on your own strong immunity before the vaccine was successfully developed [42], [43]. The drug resistance of microbes is a challenging problem in the world, and it is often faced with the situation of no drug available. Incidence of infection caused by drug resistance organism is increasing in hospital, and this will enhance medical financial burden [44]. And it was considered to be caused by overuse of antimicrobial. Besides, the drug resistance rate varies in different regions, a higher rates of drug resistance was observed in developing countries [45], [46]. In this study, Acinetobacter baumannii showed a high resistance rate to most antibacterial drugs, up to 85.7%; and the drug resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae to SXT reaches 57.1%. Fortunately, neither of the two is resistant to tegacyclin or myxomycin at present. But, the high bacterial resistance rate still poses a serious threat to clinical antibacterial treatment in this hospital. Some scholars have suggested that strict antibacterial drug management may be beneficial for inhibiting bacterial resistance [47], [48], while the development of new antibacterial drugs is also imminent at the same time. In recent years, although much researches have been done on the mechanism of bacterial resistance [49], [50], [51], and some new pathways to combat bacterial resistance have also been discovered [52], [53], the confrontation between humans and bacteria will never stop.",
