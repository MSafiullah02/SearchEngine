            "text": "As described in Chapter 1, \u201cThe World of Viruses\u201d viruses were initially characterized as filterable agents capable of causing disease. Since that time, advances in microscopy and scientific techniques have led to a better classification of viruses and their properties. Electron microscopy has allowed us to visualize viruses in great detail, while molecular and cellular assays have broadened our understanding of how viruses function and are related to one another. Taken together, we have learned that although they can be quite diverse, viruses share several common characteristics:1.Viruses are Small in Size.The smallest of viruses are about 20 nm in diameter, although influenza and the human immunodeficiency virus have a more typical size, about 100 nm in diameter. Average human cells are 10\u201330 \u03bcm (microns) in diameter, which means that they are generally 100 to 1000 times larger than the viruses that are infecting them.However, some viruses are significantly larger than 100 nm. Poxviruses, such as the variola virus that causes smallpox, can approach 400 nm in length, and filoviruses, such as the dangerous Ebola virus and Marburg virus, are only 80 nm in diameter but extend into long threads that can reach lengths of over 1000 nm. Several very large viruses that infect amoebas have recently been discovered: megavirus is 400 nm in diameter, and pandoraviruses have an elliptical or ovoid structure approaching 1000 nm in length. It is a common mistake to think that all viruses are smaller than bacteria; most bacteria are typically 2000\u20133000 nm in size, but certain strains of bacteria called Mycobacteria can be 10 times smaller than this, putting them in the range of these large viruses. So although a characteristic of viruses is that they are all small in size, this ranges from only a few nanometers to larger than some bacteria (Fig. 2.1\n).2.Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning that they are completely dependent upon the internal environment of the cell to create new infectious virus particles, or virions.All viruses make contact with and bind the surface of a cell to gain entry into the cell. The virus disassembles and its genetic material (made of nucleic acid) encodes the instructions for the proteins that will spontaneously assemble into the new virions. This is known as de novo replication, from the Latin for \u201cfrom new.\u201d In contrast to cells, which grow in size and divide equally in two to replicate, viruses use the cell\u2019s energy and machinery to create and assemble new virions piece by piece, completely from scratch.3.The genetic material of viruses can be composed of DNA or RNA.All living cells, whether human, animal, plant, or bacterial, have double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as their genetic material. Viruses, on the other hand, have genomes, or genetic material, that can be composed of DNA or RNA (but not both). Genomes are not necessarily double-stranded, either; different virus types can also have single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes, and viruses with RNA genomes can be single-stranded or double-stranded. Any particular virus will only have one type of nucleic acid genome, however, and so viruses are not encountered that have both ssDNA and ssRNA genomes, for example.Similarly to how the size of the virus particle varies significantly, the genome size can also vary greatly from virus to virus. A typical virus genome falls in the range of 7000\u201320,000 base pairs (bp) (7\u201320 kilobase pairs (kb)). Smaller-sized virions will naturally be able to hold less nucleic acid than larger virions, but large viruses do not necessarily have large genomes. While most viruses do not contain much nucleic acid, some dsDNA viruses have very large genomes: herpesviruses have genomes that are 120\u2013200 kb in total, and the very large pandoraviruses mentioned previously have the largest genomes: up to 2.5 million bases, rivaling the genome size of many bacteria! In comparison, eukaryotic cells have much larger genomes: a red alga has the smallest known eukaryotic genome, at 8 million base pairs; a human cell contains over 3 billion nucleotides in its hereditary material; the largest genome yet sequenced, at over 22 billion base pairs, is that of the loblolly pine tree.\nRefresher: Orders of Magnitude and Scientific NotationVirion size: Getting Smaller\nVirus genome size: Getting Bigger\n\nStudy BreakDescribe the common characteristics of viruses.\n",

The helix (plural: helices) is a spiral shape that curves cylindrically around an axis. It is also a common biological structure: many proteins have sections that have a helical shape, and DNA is a double-helix of nucleotides. In the case of a helical virus, the viral nucleic acid coils into a helical shape and the capsid proteins wind around the inside or outside of the nucleic acid, forming a long tube or rod-like structure (Fig. 2.4\n). The nucleic acid and capsid constitute the nucleocapsid. In fact, the protein that winds around the nucleic acid is often called the nucleocapsid protein. Once in the cell, the helical nucleocapsid uncoils and the nucleic acid becomes accessible.\n",

This protein subunit is repeated over and over again to form the capsid. This structure is simple and requires less free energy to assemble than a capsid composed of multiple proteins. In addition, having only one nucleocapsid protein means that only one gene is required instead of several, thereby reducing the length of nucleic acid required. Because the helical structure can continue indefinitely, there are also no constraints on how much nucleic acid can be packaged into the virion: the capsid length will be the size of the coiled nucleic acid.",

            "text": "An icosahedron is a geometric shape with 20 sides (or faces), each composed of an equilateral triangle. An icosahedron has what is referred to as 2\u20133\u20135 symmetry, which is used to describe the possible ways that an icosahedron can rotate around an axis. If you hold an icosahedral die in your hand, you will notice there are different ways of rotating it (Fig. 2.6\n). Let\u2019s say you In-Depth Look: Defining Helical Capsid StructureA helix is mathematically defined by two parameters, the amplitude and the pitch, that are also applied to helical capsid structures. The amplitude is simply the diameter of the helix and tells us the width of the capsid. The pitch is the height or distance of one complete turn of the helix. In the same way that we can determine the height of a one-story staircase by adding up the height of the stairs, we can figure out the pitch of the helix by determining the rise, or distance gained by each capsid subunit. A staircase with 20 stairs that are each 6 inches tall results in a staircase of 10 feet in height; a virus with 16.3 subunits per turn and a rise of 0.14 nm for each subunit results in a pitch of 2.28 nm. This is the architecture of tobacco mosaic virus.\nlooked straight on at one of the edges of the icosahedron and poked an imaginary pencil through the middle of that edge. Your pencil would be right in the middle of a triangle facing up and a triangle facing down. If you rotate the icosahedron clockwise, you will find that in 180 degrees you encounter the same arrangement (symmetry): a triangle facing up and a triangle facing down. Continuing to rotate the icosahedron brings you back to where you began. This is known as the twofold axis of symmetry, because as you rotate the shape along this axis (your pencil), you encounter your starting structure twice in one revolution: once when you begin, and again when rotated 180 degrees. On the other hand, if you put your pencil axis directly through the center one of the small triangle faces of the icosahedron, you will encounter the initial view two additional times as you rotate the shape, for a total of three times. This is the threefold axis. Similarly, if your pencil axis goes through a vertex (or tip) of the icosahedron, you will find symmetry five times in one rotation, forming the fivefold axis. It is for this reason that an icosahedron is known to have 2\u20133\u20135 symmetry, because it has twofold, threefold, and fivefold axes of symmetry. This terminology is useful when dealing with an icosahedral virus because it can be used to indicate specific locations on the virus or where the virion has interactions with the cell surface. For instance, if a virus interacts with a cell surface receptor at the threefold axis, then you know this interaction occurs at one of the faces of the icosahedron. A protein protruding from the capsid at the fivefold axis will be found at one of the vertices (tips) of the icosahedron. All of the illustrations of viruses in Fig. 2.7\nare viewed on the twofold axis of symmetry.Study BreakHow many twofold axes of symmetry are found in one icosahedron? How about the number of threefold or fivefold axes? How many faces, edges, and vertices are found in an icosahedron?\n",

            "text": "But how can some viruses form very large icosahedral capsids? The answer is repetition. The structural unit can be repeated over and over again to form a larger icosahedron side. The number of structural units that creates each side is called the triangulation number (T), because the structural units form the triangle face of the icosahedron. In a T\n = 1 virus, only one structural unit forms each icosahedron face (Fig. 2.8). In a T\n = 4 virus, four structural units form the face. Sometimes the structural unit overlaps from one face to another: in a T\n = 3 virus, three total structural units form the face, although this occurs as six half-units (half of each structural unit forms part of an adjacent face). Similarly, the structural units of a T\n = 7 virus are also slightly skewed, compared to the triangle face. The geometry and math involved with icosahedral capsid structure can be complex, and only the very basics are described here. In any case, by increasing the number of identical structural units on each face, the icosahedron can become progressively larger without requiring additional novel proteins to be produced. Some viruses have triangulation numbers over 25, even!",

Negative-strand (also negative-sense or minus-strand) RNA is not translatable into proteins; it first has to be transcribed into positive-strand RNA.

Virus names should also not include any person\u2019s name (although historically this was how a few viruses were named), and selected names should be easy to use and meaningful.When directly referring to a viral order, family, genus, or species the virus name should be written in italics with the first letter capitalized. When not referring specifically to viral classification, however, capitalization and italics are not required unless a proper name is encountered. For instance, \u201cSome members of the Arenaviridae family can cause severe disease, including lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and Lassa virus, which is named after the town in Nigeria where the first case occurred.\u201d The chart below gives some examples of where virus named originated (Table 2.3\n).\n",

A typical bacterium is 2\u20133 \u03bcM in length; a typical eukaryotic cell is 10\u201330 \u03bcM in diameter.\u2022Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and are completely dependent upon the cell for replication. Unlike cells that undergo mitosis and split in two, viruses completely disassemble within the cell and new virions (infectious particles) are assembled de novo from newly made components.\u2022While living things have dsDNA genomes, the genetic material of viruses can be composed of DNA or RNA, and single- or double-stranded. Most virus genomes fall within the range of 7\u201320 kb, but they range from 3 kb to over 2 mb.\n",

In addition, some viruses also have a lipid membrane envelope, derived from the cell. All helical animal viruses are enveloped.\u2022Helical capsid proteins wind around the viral nucleic acid to form the nucleocapsid. A helix is mathematically defined by amplitude and pitch.\u2022An icosahedron is a geometric shape with 20 sides, each composed of an equilateral triangle. The sides are composed of viral protein subunits that create a structural unit, which is repeated to form a larger side and the other sides of the icosahedron. The triangulation number refers to the number of structural units per side.\n",
