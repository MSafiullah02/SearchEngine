            "text": "Cathepsins, generally referred to as \u201clysosomal proteolytic enzymes\u201d, are composed of cysteine proteases including cathepsins B, C, H, F, K, L, S, W, and X/Z, serine proteases including cathepsins A and G, and aspartate cathepsins including cathepsins D and E [1]. All cathepsins are first synthesized as inactive preproenzymes, and then become activated after proteolytic removal of an N-terminal propeptide [2]. Among the cysteine cathepsins that are papain-like proteases, cathepsin B is the most well studied member. Based on sequence homology and three-dimensional structural similarity, cysteine cathepsins are divided into two subfamilies, the L-like enzymes with the highly conserved interspersed ERFNIN motif in the propeptide region including cathepsin L, and the B-like enzymes with shorter propeptides lacking this motif including cathepsin B [3]. However, cathepsin B possesses an extra 20 amino acid peptide segment, termed the occluding loop. This loop partially blocks the end of the active site cleft and positions a positively charged imidazole group of a histidine residue to accept the negative charge at the C-terminus of the substrate, thus vesting cathepsin B with peptidase activity [4].",

The main function of cathepsin B has long been believed to degrade proteins that have entered the lysosomal system from outside the cell (via endocytosis or phagocytosis) or from other compartments within the cell (autophagy) [5]. In addition to its physiological roles, cathepsin B is also involved in many pathological processes, such as cancer, apoptosis, inflammation, infection and other diseases [6], [7], [8], [9]. The expression and activity of cathepsin B are able to be upregulated by interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and interleukin (IL)-6 [10], [11]. Recent research further suggests that cathepsins B and L might determine host cell susceptibility to infection by intracellular viral pathogens. One group demonstrates that either cathepsin L or B is required for reovirus (a non-enveloped virus with segmented dsRNA genome) entry into murine fibroblasts [12], another reveals an essential role for cathepsin B in Ebola virus GP-dependent entry [13], and still another indicates that endosomal proteolysis by cathepsins B and L is necessary for murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) 2 spike-mediated entry into hosts [14].",

In fish, cathepsin B activity has been described in eggs and larvae of different fish species like sea bass [15], cod [16], and salmonids [17], and is implicated in the digestion of the yolk proteins in oocytes, fertilized eggs and the yolk sac, contributing to the quality and viability of the eggs and the energy source of the embryo [15], [18], [19]. Several reports reveal an immuno-regulatory role for some fish cathepsins. Cathepsin D is identified in the mucus of wounded catfish, participating in generation of a potent 19-residue linear antimicrobial peptide named parasin I from unacetylated histone H2A [20], [21]. Cathepsins B and L are secreted by Japanese eel skin epidermal cells [22] and their activities significantly increase during bacteriosis via the skin [23]. These findings indicate that cathepsins have complex functions and might play different roles under different conditions.",

SMRV but not GCHV can easily propagate in FEC cells, and result in an obvious cytopathic effect (CPE) and cell death [34]. Poly I:C is a synthetic analog of dsRNAs that are generally produced during virus reproduction and triggers antiviral responses in host cells. UV-inactivated virus loses its virulence and cannot replicate after UV irradiation for a short time [29], [30]. As compared to induction by UV-inactivated GCHV and SMRV, a high level expression of PoCatB was induced by SMRV or poly I:C, indicating that virus replication and particle release cycles might contribute to upregulate transcription of PoCatB. The delay in reaching maximum transcript expression of PoCatB in SMRV infection compared to that in poly I:C treatment could be ascribed to the time for the virus replication and particle release cycles. LPS is a component of Gram-negative bacteria. The expression of PoCatB was induced from 12 h post-treatment, sustained at a low level and reached the peak of about 4.5 fold upregulation at 96 h (Fig. 2A). This corroborates the report that LPS induces increased intracellular cathepsin B activity in THP-1 cells [40]. This suggested that the enzyme in flounder might also have a role in defense against bacteria as demonstrated in the skins of some fishes such as Japanese eel and catfish [23].",

Microbes induce immune responses of host cells by interacting with certain cell surface receptors, termed pattern recognition receptors. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been identified as important pattern recognition receptors, with a large family containing at least 11 members. Each TLR has a specific ligand(s). Accumulating evidence shows that different pathogen molecules lead to activate distinct TLRs. TLR2 and its coreceptor CD14 recognize LPS from Gram-negative bacteria and directly mediate LPS induced signaling pathways [41]. TLR9 is involved in recognition of bacterial flagellin, while TLR2 and TLR6 are required in response to peptidoglycan. DsRNA is always produced by most viruses during their replication and induces the synthesis of type I interferons by activation of TLR3 [42], [43]. Various combinations of TLR receptors may be used to discriminate different microbes [44], and different TLR receptors elicit different downstream signaling pathways. Interestingly, two TLRs (TLR2 and TLR22) were found in Japanese flounder and both of them were induced by peptidoglycan and poly I:C [45]. In our study, the expression of PoCatB was induced by virus, poly I:C and LPS treatments, and this suggests that TLRs could be involved in the induced production of cathepsins. However, this needs further investigation.",

Now it seems there is insufficient data from the FEC cells treatment experiment to clarify whether PoCatB expression is associated with the host antiviral response. However, the in vivo work might suggest some relationships between PoCatB and the flounder antiviral response because both PoCatB and Mx transcripts showed abundance increases in the immuno-related tissues head kidney, posterior kidney and intestine (Fig. 3).

Knockout analysis has shown that cathepsin B plays a major role in pathological trypsinogen activation in the early course of experimental pancreatitis and contributes significantly to TNF-\u03b1 induced hepatocyte apoptosis [46]. Recently, cathepsins B and L have been found to determine host cell susceptibility to infection by many viral pathogens, including reovirus [12], Ebola virus [13] and murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [14]. However, in some fish species, cathepsin B activity is involved in the processing of yolk materials, and in insects and other arthropods, cathepsin B and L participate in key developmental processes [47], [48]. Moreover, cathepsin B seems to exert different, even opposite, effects under the control of certain conditions. For instance, cathepsin B promotes angiogenesis during cancer progression [9], while it is also found to suppress angiogenesis in endothelial cells [49]. These findings suggest some complex and specific functions of cathepsin B depending on different species or different cell types, and also indicate that there might be some physiological role of cathepsin B. In the present study, it is plausible that the upregulation of flounder cathepsin B by virus infection is associated with a certain host cell response, since previous studies have found that cathepsin B activity coincides with bacteriolysis in Japanese eel skin [50] and is also detected in flounder skin [51].",

Human cathepsin S (cathepsin L in mice) participates in antigen presentation and in macrophages from mice deficient in both cathepsins S and L, cathepsin F can efficiently degrade the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-associated invariant chain [52]. In catfish, cathepsin D is activated from inactive procathepsin D by epidermal injury, and is responsible for generation of parasin I from H2A in skin mucosa [21]. A phylogenetic analysis also suggests that, from an evolutionary view, cathepsins are antigen-processing enzymes, since the major selection pressure driving the evolution of the new vertebrate cathepsins may derive from the adaptive immune system which emerged with the gnatheostomes [38]. On the basis of these findings, combined with the ubiquitous expression in all tissues, flounder cathepsin B induction by virus infection might be related to host cell survival, even to antiviral immune responses. In order to testify this hypothesis, it is high of interest to further study the function of PoCatB under different stresses in the future.",
