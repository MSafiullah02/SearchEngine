            "text": "Purpose AE37 and GP2 are HER2 derived peptide vaccines. AE37 primarily elicits a CD4+ response while GP2 elicits a CD8+ response against the HER2 antigen. These peptides were tested in a large randomized trial to assess their ability to prevent recurrence in HER2 expressing breast cancer patients. The primary analyses found no difference in 5-year overall disease-free survival (DFS) but possible benefit in subgroups. Here, we present the final landmark analysis. Methods In this 4-arm, prospective, randomized, single-blinded, multi-center phase II trial, disease-free node positive and high-risk node negative breast cancer patients enrolled after standard of care therapy. Six monthly inoculations of vaccine (VG) vs. control (CG) were given as the primary vaccine series with 4 boosters at 6-month intervals. Demographic, safety, immunologic, and DFS data were evaluated. Results 456 patients were enrolled; 154 patients in the VG and 147 in CG for AE37, 89 patients in the VG and 91 in CG for GP2. The AE37 arm had no difference in DFS as compared to CG, but pre-specified exploratory subgroup analyses showed a trend towards benefit in advanced stage (p = 0.132, HR 0.573 CI 0.275-1.193), HER2 under-expression (p = 0.181, HR 0.756 CI 0.499-1.145), and triple-negative breast cancer (p = 0.266, HR 0.443 CI 0.114-1.717). In patients with both HER2 under-expression and advanced stage, there was significant benefit in the VG (p = 0.039, HR 0.375 CI 0.142-0.988) as compared to CG. The GP2 arm had no significant difference in DFS as compared to CG, but on subgroup analysis, HER2 positive patients had no recurrences with a trend toward improved DFS (p = 0.052) in VG as compared to CG. Conclusions This phase II trial reveals that AE37 and GP2 are safe and possibly associated with improved clinical outcomes of DFS in certain subgroups of breast cancer patients. With these findings, further evaluations are warranted of AE37 and GP2 vaccines given in combination and/or separately for specific subsets of breast cancer patients based on their disease biology.",

            "text": "Despite progress via early detection and improved treatment, breast cancer recurrence remains a significant problem. Immunotherapy shows promise in the treatment of multiple cancers and may further improve outcomes in breast cancer. Increasing evidence suggests breast cancer is more immunogenic than once realized, particularly given the important prognostic role that the host immune response and tumor microenvironment play [1] [2] [3] . Immune-mediated surveillance and clearance of disease likely plays an important role in preventing recurrence in clinically disease-free patients after standard of care therapy. Cancer vaccines may help generate a tumor-specific immunity to prevent disease recurrence. HER2 is a tumor-associated antigen expressed at some level in 60-70% of breast cancers, over-expressed in 20-30% of patients, and is one potential target for breast cancer vaccines [4, 5] . Monoclonal antibodies targeting HER2 provide clinical benefit, at least in part due to an immunologic mechanism in HER2 over-expressing breast cancer [6] . Likewise, vaccines targeting immunogenic HER2 peptides may provide benefit via immune-mediated cancer cell elimination.",

Thus, exploring additional strategies, such as, MHC class-II epitope treatment stimulating a CD4+ T helper cell response [11] [12] [13] and treatment with subdominant epitopes, which may be less prone to T-cell anergy by persistent antigen exposure may be beneficial [14] .",

            "text": "Here, we report the results of a multi-center, randomized, blinded, controlled phase II trial of the peptide vaccines, GP2 and AE37, as adjuvant therapy in women with highrisk breast cancer to prevent recurrence. We found that both the CD8+ CTL-eliciting GP2 and the CD4 + T helper celleliciting AE37 vaccines are safe with limited toxicity that is primarily due to the GM-CSF immunoadjuvant and not the individual peptides [7, 17] . Furthermore, while the overall DFS does not appear to be improved in the ITT population, multiple subsets may derive some benefit based on prespecified exploratory analyses. Interestingly, the responding patient subsets to GP2 and AE37 are very different suggesting the potential to target specific patients and/or combining the peptides to address a broader patient population. A current limitation of this analysis is the per-treatment nature possibly affecting the external validity of the data; although, the number of patients excluded from the ITT to PT analysis was small (n = 27, 5.9% overall of patients). Even with the exclusion of these early recurrence and second malignancy patients, there was still no significant differences between the group demographics. It has long been known that subtypes of breast cancer have different levels of responsiveness to chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and HER2-directed therapy. Breast cancer subtypes similarly have distinct immunologic characteristics. The TNBC subtype appears to have the greatest amount of immune infiltration, followed by the highly-proliferative estrogen receptor positive subtype. Meanwhile, the lowgrade, estrogen receptor positive, luminal A subtype appears to have the lowest infiltration rate [20] . This recognition is of increasing clinical importance, not only because of the recent rise of immunotherapy to the forefront of cancer care, but also because tumor immune characteristics can also be prognostic in breast cancer [21] . The data from this analysis suggest that the GP2 peptide vaccine may be beneficial in patients with HER2 overexpressing tumors who received trastuzumab as part of their standard of care treatment. This supports the hypothesis that GP2 may have synergistic clinical efficacy when combined with trastuzumab [22] . Previous preclinical work by Mittendorf et al. demonstrated that HER2 receptors on the tumor cell surface can be saturated by treatment with trastuzumab, promoting internalization in a time and dose-dependent manner. Trastuzumab increased the sensitivity of the tumor cells to CTL-mediated lysis after stimulation with either nelipepimut-S or GP2, even in patients with low levels of HER2 expression. Interestingly, they also found peripheral blood lymphocytes lyse trastuzumab-treated breast cancer cells more efficiently after nelipepimut-S vaccination. We are currently investigating the possibility of a synergistic immunologic effect when nelipepimut-S is given in combination with trastuzumab in a phase II trial in HER2 overexpressing (3+ by IHC; NCT02297698). We recently completed a trial in low-expressing HER2 (IHC 1-2+) patients and found the greatest clinical benefit in DFS in patients with TNBC, suggesting a synergistic mechanism in this population [23] . In addition to the potential synergy with trastuzumab, GP2 may be inherently more effective in the HER2 over-expressing population. These patients have increased HER2 expression, their immune system has greater exposure to this tumor-associated antigen. Given that GP2 is a subdominant epitope of HER2, there may be less immune tolerance to this epitope than a dominant epitope, such as nelipepimut-S. This likely allows GP2 to be more effective in HER2 over-expressing disease; where nelipepimut-S may be more effective in HER2 low-expressing patients [9] .",

Specifically, demonstrating earlier DFS plateau that was maintained for up to the ten years of follow-up. AE37 has been shown to induce CD4+ T helper cell stimulation which is required for the effective generation of long-term cell-mediated immunity [24, 25] . Given that the primary response to AE37 is not a CTL response, but instead a CD4+ T helper cell response, the AE37 vaccine may have more of an immunoadjuvant effect to a pre-existing immune response within the patient. AE37 can also augment a vaccine-induced CTL response. Gates et. al, demonstrated the primary CD4+ T helper cell stimulating AE37 peptide vaccine may increase the number of activated CD8+ CTLs [26] . And Perez et al. demonstrated vaccination with AE37 primes not only the CD4+ T cells, but also primes CD8+ T cells and is able to induce CD8+ responses to both AE36 and AE37 in cancer patients [27] . AE37 is able to directly stimulate the HLA-DR alleles with epitopes present in the HER2 protein. The immunologic effect of AE37 vaccination has also been shown to increase IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 + responder cells which in turn assists in strong in vivo and in vitro autologous CTL lysing of tumor cells [28, 29] . Thus, the addition of the Ii-Key in AE37 specifically enhances immune responses via the MHC class I pathway [27] .",

A similar finding was demonstrated in a HER2 peptide derived vaccine on a dendritic cell platform that stimulates both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. This MHC class 2 vaccine was also given in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy and demonstrated improved survival in a preclinical model [30] . It is worth exploring future trials of combinations of check point inhibitors and peptide-based vaccine strategies to improve DFS. While the potential for CTL-mediated, anti-tumor cytolytic effect via peptide vaccines like nelipepimut-S and GP2 certainly provide promise as a potential stand-alone weapon in the fight against cancer, the CTL effects are limited temporally given the natural transient course of such cytotoxic immune responses. Thus, a vaccine that combines CTL and T helper cell targeted peptides may not only induce the more immediate CTLmediated cytolytic response against any occult residual disease, but also induce T helper cell-mediated long-term immunologic memory to protect against tumor recurrence.",

Ultimately, our goal is to advance the field of personalized immunotherapies based on a patient's specific disease characteristics. While neither vaccine demonstrated a statistically significant DFS benefit in the overall study population, there are signals of benefit in certain subpopulations of breast cancer patients. This is, perhaps, not surprising given distinct differences in terms of prognosis and treatment response in the different subtypes of breast cancer. This is reflected in our data, which suggests that different peptide vaccine strategies may be required to achieve clinical benefit for distinct subtypes of the same malignancy.
