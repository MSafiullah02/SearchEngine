Peripheral circulatory insufficiency gradually worsened, and large amounts of infusion loads (including blood transfusions) were unable to maintain her BP. Her lactic acid level reached a maximum of 19 mmol/L. At maximum disease severity, she required noradrenaline 1 \u03bcg/kg/minute, vasopressin 2 units/hour, steroids 200 mg/day, dopamine 10 \u03bcg/kg/minute, dobutamine 4 \u03bcg/kg/minute, and adrenaline 0.15 \u03bcg/kg/minute to maintain BP. She also showed other organ failures, including worsening hepatic dysfunction after admission with maximum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 16,520 U/L as well as kidney dysfunction with associated anuria. Continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated for anuria and metabolic acidosis. At 36 hours post-admission, her lactic acid level reached its peak, and her hemodynamic reached a level at which she could tolerate water removal. At 72 hours post-admission, she was administered with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor due to the appearance of myelosuppression. In addition to the broad-spectrum antimicrobial administration, she was commenced on a course of antimycotic medication. Table 2 shows the laboratory results of organs function over time.",

First (within 24 hours of ingestion), the patient presents with severe gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Second, the patient develops ARDS and myelosuppression between the second and seventh day of ingestion. This then leads to multiple organ failure, including liver and kidney failure. Finally, temporary hair loss was seen after the seventh day of ingestion (during the recovery phase) [1, 7]. We believe that the progress of the present case is consistent with colchicine poisoning. Our patient also experienced multiple intracranial hemorrhages thought to be associated with DIC caused by the gastrointestinal symptoms and multiple organ failure.",
