            "text": "In December 2019, an unknown pneumonia spread amongst a group of people in Wuhan, China, now termed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 patients were reported with a cluster of acute respiratory illness and higher interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1a (MIP1A), and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) in plasma [1, 2]. It was caused by an unknown beta coronavirus, initially called as 2019-nCoV; later the unknown beta coronavirus was named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which formed a clade within the subgenus Sarbecovirus [2, 3]. Apart from the well-known MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), the SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects humans [4]. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 has 89% and 82% nucleotide similarity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and of human SARS-CoV, respectively. The phylogenetic trees of spike, membrane, envelope, orf1a/b, and nucleoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 are clustered closely with those of the bat, civet, and human SARS-CoV. The external subdomain of the spike\u2019s receptor of SARS-CoV-2 has 40% amino acid similarity with other SARS-related CoV [5]. The entire orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 encodes a novel short protein. Moreover, new orf8 of SARS-CoV-2 probably encodes a secreted protein with an a-helix, a b-sheet(s) having six strands [5]. The phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that WH-Human-1 coronavirus (WHCV) or SARS-CoV-2 was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that were previously sampled from bats in China and that have a history of genomic recombination [6]. A recent study confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 cell entry receptor, similar to SARS-CoV [7].",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global pandemic health threat. SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new strain of the Beta-CoVs genera, and is a member of the zoonotic origin coronavirus group. It causes coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), which is the greatest concern in all the countries involved in the outbreak for health and economy reasons. SARS-CoV-2 is distinct from the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus [2, 3, 25\u201327]. However, the phylogenetic analysis of the envelope protein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein revealed that these proteins are close to the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of bat coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (Figures 4\u20136). Hence, the study was designed to predict potent ligands against druggable envelope and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. The 3D models of the envelope protein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 were predicted, validated, and used for docking studies. The docking studies help in the prediction of the preferred orientation of a ligand with the binding site on a protein and are used for conformation of various chemical compounds at the target site of the protein. The most potent identified compounds for envelope protein, mycophenolic acid and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, 1-[(2,4-dichloro-phenyl)methyl]pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid) with highest log octanol/water partition coefficient (Log P), high number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, lowest non-bonded interaction energy (DG) between the receptor and the ligand, and high binding affinity (pKi), indicate that they are the most potent compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 envelope and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein.",

Hence, the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein was considered for the docking study to identify the most potent compound; the study revealed that mycophenolic acid may an appropriate druggable protein ligand of SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit the development of a COVID-19 by blocking the viral assembly. Complete wet lab analysis is needed to elucidate the impact of the mycophenolic acid on the virus\u2019 exit from the host cell by viral budding, the effect on blocking the envelope formation by taking portions of the host cell membranes, as well as its controlling power on release of infectious virus from the host cell.",

The WHO recommendation for the management of MERS-CoV is being in practice: initiation of oxygen therapy to keep the oxygen saturation above 90%, with conservative fluid management in the absence of shock, and an empiric antimicrobial regimen that includes antibiotics and a neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza. All of those supportive treatments are for the prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome and for the prevention septic shock [2, 3, 36]. Hence, drug development against SARS-CoV-2 is considered urgent in order to fight COVID-19. The present in-silico approach identifies one potent ligand against the envelope protein and one potent ligand against nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. A combination of these two ligands might be the best option to consider for further detailed studies in wet laboratories to develop a drug for treating patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.",
