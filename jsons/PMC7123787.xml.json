Viruses are so small that they are invisible even at high magnification with a light microscope. Viruses cannot be grown independently in culture as can bacteria and other free-living microorganisms; viruses require a living cell for reproduction, whether animal, bacterial or plant. A virus contains genetic information\u2014DNA or RNA\u2014yet the statement that a virus is alive is a controversial one. In the 1930s, Wendell Stanley\nwas able to form crystals in solution of the tobacco mosaic virus, a feat that had been performed up until then only with pure chemical molecules infinitesimally smaller than a virus. Viruses form aggregates (clumping) in solution and bond chemically with each other to form a crystal. Many different viruses have been crystallized, and their basic shape and composition revealed. Viruses are at the edge of life, having attributes of inert objects, such as the ability to form crystals, yet also possessing characteristics associated with life, such as genetic material and reproduction. One virus can replicate and give rise to millions more, which is certainly an attribute of life. A virus exists in two stages, one as an inert chemical with a chemical formula; for example, the chemical formula for poliovirus is C332,652 H492,388 N98,245 O131,196 P7,501 S2,340 [1]; when the virus enters a living cell, it becomes an active replicating organism.",

The theory of \u201cin balance in humors\u201d (body fluids) dates back to the ancient Greeks or even earlier. Currently, some individuals, and even whole societies, believe that AIDS and other diseases are the result of divine punishment for specific lifestyles.

He describes the onset of fever, sneezing and coughing, with the discharge of blood and a fetid smell, followed by the appearance of ulcers and small pustules on the skin. This was followed by diarrhea and death. Thucydides claims that birds of prey that devoured the bodies also died, and that the disease could spread to domestic animals.

Pockmarks similar to those of smallpox have been found on the face of a mummified Pharaoh recovered from the pyramids of Egypt. Some drawings on the tombs from the same period indicate wasting of limbs that could be due to poliovirus. It has been suggested that viral infection of humans occurred as a result of the transition from a hunter-gatherer society to a settled agricultural society with the domestication of other mammalian species and the transfer of viruses from these animals to humans. The primitive hunter may have been a healthier person than the settled \u201cgatherer,\u201d since he lived a more isolated life, without any crowding. The proximity to domesticated animals and groups of people living under one roof probably resulted in the introduction of new infections to the human population. Examples of this have occurred with human infections in the last few years, with the spread of avian flu, SARS, and HIV\u2014 all from other animals.",

Leeuwenhoek explored the contents of many substances, including rainwater collected in barrels, flora from the mouth, semen, etc. He described tiny organisms using his microscopes that could magnify up to 300 times. These observations opened up a previously invisible world to science and allowed advances in many areas beyond diseases. An entire invisible world existed but it did not, however, include viruses, which are too small to be seen even with the best light microscope (Figs. 1.3, 1.4).\n\n\n",

He devoted a large part of his life to studying muscardine, a disease of the silkworm. Muscardine was an important fungal pest of the economically important silk industry of Northern Italy. Many farms were abandoned because of this disease. Bassi concluded from his studies that an infectious agent that could be transmitted by contact between worms, and also could be transmitted by contaminated cages or utensils, caused the disease. He identified the infectious agent as a fungus, later named Beauvaria bassiana. He is also credited with rescuing the vitally important silk industry with recommendations such as the use of disinfectants; separating the rows of feeding caterpillars; isolating and destroying infected caterpillars; and keeping the silk farms clean. He used \u201csemi-sterile\u201d techniques to prevent infection. Pasteur and others who came after him were unaware of his research and made similar, independent discoveries. Bassi also proposed that human diseases such as syphilis and measles were transmitted from one person to another by contact.

For example, Benjamin Jesty, a farmer in Dorset (southern England), had inoculated his wife and children with cowpox material during an outbreak in 1774 and, I assume, induced immunity in the family. In 1796 Jenner tested his hypothesis that the pus from the wounds that occurred on the udder of milking cows contained material that could protect against smallpox by inoculating James Phipps, the son of his gardener, with pus from a wound on the hand of his milkmaid, Sarah Nelmes, who had been infected by a virus from a cow named Blossom. Blossom is probably one of the most famous cows in history, her hide immortalized in St George\u2019s Hospital Medical School in London. James was then variolated with the smallpox virus a number of times and had basically no reaction, showing complete immunity. Jenner then tested vaccination on 23 other people, none of whom came down with smallpox. He presented his data to the Royal Society and published his data [4]. His idea of preventing smallpox with a \u201cvaccine\u201d was not easily accepted on religious grounds (\u201cinterfering with the work of God\u201d); also ridiculed was the use of material from a cow (see cartoon, Fig. 1.7) (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-07758-1_19, Vaccines).\n",

By 1832 the U.S. government had set up a program for the vaccination of American Indians; known as the Indian Vaccination Act. Unfortunately it did not eradicate the spread of the virus and was misused to remove Indians to reservations. Thus there was a piecemeal attempt to eradicate the virus in a few areas of the world, such as India and the East Indies. By 1897 smallpox had been eradicated from the US and by the beginning of the twentieth century from most of the industrialized countries of Europe. Despite this, 2,000,000 people died annually from the disease in the 1950s; therefore, a campaign was launched in 1959 to completely eradicate the virus from the hemisphere.

In 1857\u20131858 Pasteur made the discovery that put to rest the theory of spontaneous generation of life. He showed that liquids in sealed containers remained sterile, but that exposure to the air resulted in contaminations that gave rise to fermentations or growth of bacteria or fungi. He wrote, \u201cgerms of microscopic organisms abound in the surface of all objects, in the air, and in water,\u201d concluding that these organisms cause fermentation, such as occur in wine, beer, vinegar etc., and that under sterile conditions with no access to air these fermentations do not take place.",

He showed that the bacteria had a life cycle, including a stage of spore formation, a stage not easily destroyed by heat or other means, which could account for infections occurring at various periods, and allowed organisms to live in the soil for a long time. Among other achievements, Koch went on to isolate and describe the organism responsible for tuberculosis. Koch was influenced by his mentor, Jacob Henle, who in 1840 proposed that infectious diseases were caused by living organisms and reproduced outside the infected individual. Earlier, Aloys Pollender, Pierre-Francois Olive Rayer and Casamir-Joseph Davaine had discovered the anthrax bacterium. Koch himself set out to prove scientifically that this bacillus is, in fact, the cause of the disease. He inoculated mice with homemade slivers of wood containing anthrax bacilli taken from the spleens of farm animals that had died of the disease, and found that these mice were susceptible to the disease and died, whereas mice inoculated at the same time with blood from the spleens of healthy animals did not. This confirmed the work of others who had shown that the disease could be transmitted by means of the blood of infected animals. He went on to develop methods of growing and staining the bacteria, and with a colleague developed the Petri dish (named after his colleague) that is still used today [7].Koch also isolated the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis, and from this developed specific postulates. To prove the causative role of the bacillus\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7the bacilli had to be isolated from the body and cultivated in pure culture until devoid of all adherent products of disease originating from the animal organism; and, finally, through transfer of the isolated bacilli to animals, the same clinical picture of tuberculosis as is obtained empirically by the injection of naturally developed tuberculous material had to be produced.\n",

It is also important that the bacteria or virus be found in all cases of the particular disease. As will be discussed later, in the case of work with yellow fever, bacteria were isolated from most yellow fever victims (not all, however) and was claimed to be the source of the disease. Only by showing that it was not present in ALL patients could it be proven that it was not the causative agent. It has proven ethically difficult to carry out Koch\u2019s postulates in the case of some viral diseases that only infect humans (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and hepatitis C). If no animal model is present, it is difficult to prove beyond a doubt\u2014without human experimentation\u2014that a specific agent is the cause of the disease. Smallpox and measles viruses also are exclusively human pathogens, and the early study of smallpox in particular involved unregulated research on human subjects. In more recent times, and particularly in the era of laboratory-driven investigations, we have had to create very specific ethical guidelines. Many of the discoveries, such as the role of mosquitoes in transmitting yellow fever, and vaccination against smallpox, involved the use of humans in a manner not acceptable today.",

In a paper in 1880, Pasteur described the application of his findings and techniques to other conditions, particularly furuncles (boils). He showed that the pus that developed from such lesions contained infectious chains made of round cells (cocci) and that this organism could also be grown in culture. He showed that every furuncle contained cocci that caused the inflammation and pus formation. These organisms were injected into rabbits and formed abscesses containing pus, and the same organism could be isolated again (Koch\u2019s postulate).

The relationship between cancer and viruses was first discovered in an avian species (domestic poultry). Unfortunately, the relevance of disease in non-humans, particularly in non-mammals, to humans was not realized until 50 or 60 years later. We now know, through examples such as \u201cavian flu\u201d or \u201cswine flu,\u201d that other animals are stricken with the same vectors as man, can transmit these vectors to man, or act as a reservoir for these diseases. The first reported case of a possible virus related to cancer was the observation in 1908 by two Danish veterinary researchers, Vilhelm Ellerman and Oluf Bang, who found that leukemia of chickens could be transmitted by a cell-free extract. Peyton Rous (1879\u20131970) at the Rockefeller Institute in New York reported a few years later that not only leukemia but also solid tumors (sarcomas) were transmissible [15].",

Subsequently he received a grant to do research at the Rockefeller Institute in New York. The director of the Institute, Simon Flexner, who headed the cancer laboratories, asked him to take his place since he, Flexner, wished to devote his time to poliovirus research, and Peyton Rous succeeded him. While working with spontaneous tumors of chickens, he demonstrated in 1910 that a cell-free extract made from the tumor was transmittable, and that different types of tumors arose from different cell-free extracts of different tumors. Thus the work of two groups (Ellerman/Bang and Rous) laid the groundwork for an analysis of the relationship between tumors and viruses.",

These were first discovered by Frederick Twort (1877\u20131950) [16] in England and by Felix d\u2019Herelle (1873\u20131949), a Canadian working in France. In 1910 d\u2019Herelle, working in Mexico, was alerted to the presence of dysentery in locusts [17]. He cultured the organism from the insects, and noted during the growth of the bacteria that there were areas of clearing in the culture in Petri dishes; however, he did not realize the importance of the discovery until World War I, when he was working with shigella, a bacterium that also caused dysentery in humans. D\u2019Herelle realized then that the areas of clearing were plaques caused by a filterable agent, namely a virus-infecting bacteria [18]. He also noted that the culture of bacteria cleared during this infection so that no bacteria were left (or so it appeared). D\u2019Herelle had hoped that such bacteriophage could be used in therapy against bacterial diseases [19]. This was an active area of research in the 1930s\u20131980s in Eastern Europe and Russia and today is an area of renewed research. The same idea was presented in Sinclair Lewis\u2019s novel Arrowsmith, in which a physician experiments with bacteriophage to cure common diseases [20].",

It was not until further work with bacteriophage, and simultaneously with bacteria, that it could be shown that the nucleic acid contained the genetic information. These were experiments involving DNA transformation in bacillus [21], and in later experiments with bacteriophage, it could be shown, using radio-labeled material, that the DNA of the bacteriophage entered the bacterial cells and replicated and produced progeny phage and not the protein [22] that remained attached to the outside of the cell (Fig. 1.13).\n\n",

These early studies with bacteriophage, and the parallel studies with cell culture and the growth of viruses, allowed for the quantization of virus growth. The number of scientists involved is too many to list, but all the principal players constituted the phage group, headed by Max Delbruck, that met at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories in New York.

A campaign in the United States, spearheaded by the March of Dimes, was determined to find a vaccine against polio. Based on the earlier work of John Franklin Enders and others, in 1953 Jonas Salk announced the achievement of a polio vaccine [23]. Salk became not only a celebrated scientist, but also a hero. His vaccine was based on a \u201cdead\u201d virus, which was followed two years later by a rival vaccine, the Sabin vaccine, based on a series of attenuated (weakened) viruses [24]. Both vaccines have their pros and cons, and both are still used today, although in the U.S. the Salk vaccine is considered safer since it does not involve viruses that can reproduce. However, the introduction of these vaccines was not without risk since the first batch of commercially produced Salk vaccine contained some improperly inactivated virus particles.",

In culture, these viruses were inhibited by Actinomycin D, a drug known to inhibit DNA- dependent RNA polymerase, the enzyme involved in mRNA synthesis from DNA, suggesting that these RNA viruses had a DNA stage. Although this was difficult to believe, eventually two groups in 1970 independently discovered an enzyme in infected cells (but not in uninfected cells) that copied RNA into DNA by a complicated mechanism. This was \u201creverse transcriptase,\u201d and the name \u201cretroviruses\u201d was given to this class of virus. The two labs involved were those of David Baltimore and Howard Temin, classmates from Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania [26, 27].
