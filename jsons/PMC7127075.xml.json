In Taiwan, the prevalence of MRSA amongst nosocomial staphylococcal infections was ca. 60% [6], and MRSA is an emerging community-acquired pathogen [7]. In our previous study of patients at the ED with MRSA bacteraemia, patients with true community MRSA bacteraemia were rarely seen [5]; however, in recent years the number of these patients has been increasing at our hospital [8]. Concern about MRSA bacteraemia is due to its poor response to glycopeptide treatment [9], [10], and many factors are reported to be closely associated with poor response, including severity of illness [10], type of infection [11], persistence of bacteraemia [12] and, notably, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of MRSA isolates [13], [14].",

Thus, we are interested in the outcome of patients with MRSA bacteraemia treated at the ED. Despite some studies suggesting that blood cultures ordered in the adult ED are rarely clinically useful [15], [16], MRSA bacteraemia detected at the ED would usually change the antimicrobial agent at our hospital, where empirical glycopeptide use is not recommended [17]. Moreover, bacteraemia recovered at the ED is usually less complicated compared with nosocomial bacteraemia [18]. However, these patients might not receive complete examinations if rapid mortality occurs. With increasing MRSA bacteraemia arising from the community [4], [8], we describe the results of our observational study of MRSA bacteraemia at a university hospital ED, focusing on the risk factors for poor patient outcome.",
