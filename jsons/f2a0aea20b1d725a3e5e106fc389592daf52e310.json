This work succeeds in citing minimum energy and some computer graphics technologies to support this theme. Molecular structure is that given the uncountable number of possible conformations for a protein, how we can determine the lowest energy structure. In this article the authors employed the previous researches-WebDeGrator and some existing molecular graphics tools to simulate various protein folding, ligand acceptor interaction, and molecular visualization. For this reason, bioengineer experimental curriculum will be visualization and interactive among learning members. Finally, Simpson's Taxonomy and pre-and post-test examinations are applied to System Evaluation, and molecular simulation and minimum energy will be discussed.",

The early 1990s saw significant optimism that Correspondence to W.-T. Sung computer-aided drug design (CADD) would revolutionize the development of drugs. Although drug design is an extremely complicated process and still not completely understood [2] , computer graphics technology can now construct vector models of chemical structures and manipulate them in real-time, offering the ability to interactively investigate computer models of ligand structures and their binding interactions with a receptor. Furthermore, silicon screening of compound databases is currently among the most popular chemoinformatics applications in pharmaceutical research [3] .",

A 3D structure of protein is valuable to researchers for designing experiments to study the functions of proteins. To visualize a protein whose structure has been obtained experimentally, several tools such as Roger Sayle's RasMol and MDL's Chime have been developed [8] . Most protein structures are solved experimentally. This process is boring and timeconsuming. Homology modeling is becoming a more accessible and easier method for detecting a protein's 3D structure. The users construct a homology model of their protein based upon its sequence similarity to a protein whose structure has already been found experimentally. Building an approximate model of a protein can provide a starting point for experimental design. Presently, the most popular free software programs are SwissPdb Viewer and DINAMO. SwissPdb Viewer, which is closely linked to an automated protein modeling server Swiss-Model, provides a user friendly interface to analyze several proteins simultaneously [9] . DINAMO provides interactive protein alignment and comparative modeling, and runs as either a web-based applet in conjunction with the Internet browser plug-in Chime, or as a standalone application using RasMol as molecular graphic display [10] .",

According to statistical mechanics, physical quantities are represented by averages over microscopic states of the docking system. Generally, the intention of protein folding is to find the best appropriate stability state for existing when the free energy with thermodynamics and molecular mechanics arrived at the lowest point. In nature, protein folding have finished automatically in very short time and become a dynamic stability. Unfortunately, some protein cannot afford to find the energy minimum point for existing stable state. In many experiments, the best final state of protein folding is that it has the lowest free energy and already reached the key point. Some diseases cause of protein folding is incomplete and error. In the other reasons, some compounds are not suitable due to their folding are also error or incomplete. Therefore, this study will discuss that how to find out the energy lowest point via compute simulation force field, and furthermore utility some examples for students in learning bioengineer experiment simulation courses.",

Protein extraction isolates the proteins from tissues. Protein separation can be performed either by 2-DE or by LC approaches. The proteins are then detected using various MS methods. Bioinformatics-based analyses are employed to obtain protein information to guide further functional proteomic studies. The final step in proteomic study is to create a new hypothesis from both expression and functional proteomic data. The novel hypothesis is then examined by various approaches. Figure 7 shows a flowchart of the system architecture for protein structure prediction. Beginning at the top block diagram, three sequence samples of bamboo shoot (Native, 15 cm out of the Ground and 30 cm out of the Ground) were received from National Taiwan University, Biotechnology department in summer biotechnology experiment courses in 2005. The three samples were analyzed via BLAST and SAS bioinformatics websites. A similar sequence was searched using PDB search to discern whether the sequence was homologous. Then, protein fold recognition or Comparative modeling was performed. Finally, the 3D structure of bamboo shoot protein was predicted. Figure 8a ,b shows the 1 DE SDS\u00c0PAGE and 2-DE SDS\u00c0PAGE result. Results of this experiment, in which got three different series were obtained in every stage (Table 1) .
