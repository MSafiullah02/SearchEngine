Major depressive disorder, especially in women, and lower back pain, in men, contributed to higher years lived with disability in most of these countries. Road injuries and other occupational risks are more common in those more highly developed countries where transportation and driving are reflective of a more robust economy. Communicable diseases, such as malaria and diarrhea, still have a concerning prevalence but new public health concerns include noncommunicable diseases, with respect to lifestyle changes.3 There is concern that the Middle East region \u201csuffers a drastic change from a traditional diet to an industrialized diet,\u201d4 with the attendant increase in chronic diseases affected by the ingestion of increased preprocessed foods, sugar, and saturated fats, with a reduction of healthier milk, fruits, and vegetables. The long-term effects of these dietary changes on the genome are not yet fully appreciated, but chronic disease prevalence may already be affected.",

The authors, using established predictions, project that the number of estimated new cases of oral and oropharynx cancers in this region, especially in Egypt, Iran, and Turkey, could double by the year 2030, 4 times the predicted incidence worldwide. A swell in the aging population in these countries (ie, living longer) may be a factor.9 Reducing high-risk factors such as smoking and use of smokeless tobacco (shammah and qat), and perhaps exploring or mitigating the risks for human papilloma virus infections, could be effective public health methods to address this projected increase in cancer incidence.10\n",

During World War I, the Ottoman Empire entered the conflict on the side of the Central Powers: Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. As the war concluded, several European powers maintained colonial empires, even as the Ottoman Empire dissolved. Much can be written about the ethics of empire and governance of people and cultures by outside powers, though that is beyond the scope of this article. One product of European influence in the Middle East was the Sykes-Picot Agreement.13 In this agreement, the Triple Entente (England, France, and Russia) agreed to separate spheres of influence within what was then called Asia-Minor, without significant consideration of local cultures and populations. The resulting English mandate would govern much of modern Iraq, Jordan, and modern Israel, whereas the French mandate would govern northern Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and eastern Turkey. The national boundaries later established in the region largely ignored cultural, tribal, and sectarian affiliations, setting the stage for much of the conflict resulting in this region in the subsequent century.",

Because of the prestige of a medical degree, there is considerable familial and societal pressure for students to select medicine, which is an undergraduate course of study in the British system (A. Atef, personal communication, 2017). Resulting rates of medical degree holders range widely from 0.311 per 1000 population in Yemen to 3.62 per 1000 in Israel.

As early as 1994, articles appeared encouraging an increase in graduate-level otolaryngology training within the Arab world.16 One limitation to surgical training is inherited traditions that prohibit cadaveric dissection (A. Atef, personal communication, 2017). In recent years, simulation has been used to bridge this gap.17 Another confounding issue with practice is that no single standard for credentialing exists.

Although this affords trainees a wealth of training opportunity, demand for otolaryngology services far outstrips the supply available in many communities. In such situations, regional academic otolaryngology faculty members often care for the flood of patients with extremely advanced disease. Faculty members working in these centers are forced to be creative to meet specific surgical challenges and system demands. In recent years, both armed conflict and political change following the Arab Spring uprising have increased challenges to providing effective graduate and continuing medical education in many Middle Eastern Countries. Not only has funding for medical centers and faculty been threatened and inconsistent but also, for a time, outside speakers were reluctant to participate in regional conferences because of personal security concerns. Tightening borders in Europe and the United States increases challenges to otolaryngologists who would otherwise attend conferences in these regions. Especially needed in the Middle East are more female otolaryngologists, reflective of the general requirement for female physicians across the world but especially in the male-dominant Middle East medical profession; however, advances are being made to better reflect Western gender balances in specialty training.",
