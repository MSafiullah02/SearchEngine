In this study, of 191 confirmed coronavirus patients, 50/54 patients that died had developed ARDS; conversely, only 9/137 survivors had ARDS. Moreover, the authors reported that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was cormorbid with COVID-19 (p = 0.056). Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, a proinflammatory cytokine linked with connective tissue disorders including fibrosis, were significantly higher in patients who died, and appeared to increase with disease progression. In survivors, essentially no alterations in IL-6 levels were observed.",

It also suggests that it may be reasonable to explore if IL-6 antagonists may be useful to treat COVID-19. In any event, these data strongly support the contention that development of anti-fibrotic agents is imperative not only to affect diseases such as scleroderma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and metastatic cancers, but is also necessary to treat COVID-19.",
