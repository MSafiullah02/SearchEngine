            "text": "Background & Aims: Cyclophilin-inhibitors have potent antiviral activity against Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and are promising candidates for broad-spectrum antiviral therapy. Cyclosporine A (CsA) acts immunosuppressive by blocking T cell activation and antigen presentation. Alisporivir, a non-immunosuppressive CsA analog in clinical development, does not inhibit T cell activation. In this study we explored the impact of alisporivir on antigen presentation. Methods: Hepatoma cells endogenously expressing the epitoperestricting major histocompatibility complex-class I (MHC-I) allele HLA-A2 and constitutively expressing a viral antigen were established to study the impact of cyclophilin-inhibitors on antigen presentation. Antigen-specific CD8 + T cell activation and MHC-I surface expression were measured to quantify antigen presentation. Results: Our work establishes a novel cell culture model to study antigen presentation in liver-derived cells. Authentic regulation of antigen presentation was ensured by the action of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Alisporivir pretreatment stimulated antigen presentation by hepatoma target cells, leading to enhancement of antigen-specific CD8 + T cell activation by 40%. Alisporivir, as well as a panel of other cyclophilin-inhibitors, induced an increase of MHC-I and beta-2 microglobulin on the surface of several cell lines. The drug neither enhanced MHC-I transcript or protein levels nor affected surface expression of other proteins or protein trafficking in general. Proteasome-inhibitors completely blocked the alisporivir-directed enhancement of surface MHC-I, suggesting an influence of the drug on peptide-availability. Conclusions: Alisporivir stimulates antigen presentation by inducing enhanced MHC-I surface expression, thereby promoting antigen-specific CD8 + T cell activation. This immunostimulatory function might further contribute to the antiviral activity of non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin-inhibitors. \u00d3",

            "text": "Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) establishes persistence in a high rate of patients, resulting in more than 160 million chronic infections worldwide. In recent years, direct acting antivirals and host targeting antivirals have been identified, allowing new opportunities for antiviral therapy of patients chronically infected with HCV [1] . Characteristics of host targeting antivirals include their broad genotype coverage and their high barrier to resistance [1] . One such compound is the cyclophilin (Cyp)-inhibitor alisporivir, which targets the cellular protein and HCV host factor cyclophilin A (CypA), and has been in clinical development for HCV therapy [2] [3] [4] . Furthermore, due to involvement of cyclophilins in the lifecycle of a broad range of viruses like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) or several coronaviruses, alisporivir represents a promising candidate for pan-viral therapy [5] . The drug is an analog of the cyclic undecapeptide cyclosporine A (CsA), which blocks T cell activation by forming a ternary complex together with CypA and the phosphatase calcineurin [6] . In addition, CsA suppresses major histocompatibility complex-class I (MHC-I) dependent antigen presentation by a poorly defined mechanism [7] . The structure of alisporivir differs in two amino acid residues from the immunosuppressant CsA, abrogating the inhibitory effect on T cell activation [8] . However, its effect on antigen presentation has not been clarified so far.",

            "text": "The first aim of our study was the establishment of a cell culture model allowing a quantitative assessment of functional antigen presentation by hepatocytes. To this end, we modified a previously established assay employing co-cultivation of HCVspecific HLA-A \u2044 02-restricted CD8 + T cells and Huh7 hepatoma cells ectopically expressing the MHC-I allele HLA-A \u2044 02 [9] . To generate a more physiological environment, we used hepatoma cell lines endogenously expressing HLA-A \u2044 02 and stably expressing an epitope-matched HCV-NS5B protein (NS5B EM ; EM = epitope-matched) (Fig. 1A ). NS5B-derived peptides are presented on the cellular surface via HLA-A \u2044 02, resulting in antigen-specific T cell activation during co-culture of HLA-A \u2044 02 + NS5B EM transduced hepatoma cells with NS5B-specific CD8 + T cells and concomitant production of various effector molecules (Fig. 1A) . Importantly, this co-culture assay encompasses the whole antigen presentation process, from physiological regulation of MHC-I expression and processing of an endogenous antigen to surface presentation via MHC-I. Therefore, modifications at any step of this pathway significantly impacting on the efficiency of functional antigen presentation should be detectable as changes in CD8 + T cell activation. We tested two HLA-A \u2044 02 + hepatoma cell lines, characterized by either high (HepG2) or low (Huh6.1) HLA-A \u2044 02 expression levels ( Supplementary Fig. 1A ). More than 90% of CD8 + T cells were activated upon co-culture with HepG2_NS5B EM cells, which could not be further enhanced by pretreatment of HepG2 cells with IFN-c, a well-known stimulant of MHC-I antigen presentation ( Supplementary Fig. 1B ) [15] . Therefore, HepG2 cells were not suitable for our model, since any condition enhancing antigen presentation would be missed. In contrast, Huh6.1_NS5B EM cells gave rise to a significant portion of activated CD8 + T cells, which was lower than for HepG2 (Fig. 1B) , possibly due to lower MHC-I expression levels ( Supplementary Fig. 1A) . The basic CD8 + T cell activation rate in co-cultivation assays varied between 6% and 42% in different experiments (compare Figs. 1B, 2C, D), due to passage number and pre-activation status of CD8 + T cells. Still, modulatory effects of cytokines remained the same, independent from baseline activation levels (data not shown). Upon confirming cytokine receptor expression on Huh6 Con1 cells (Supplementary Table 1 ), the founder cell line of Huh6.1, we used several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a), antiinflammatory cytokines (TGF-b and IL-4) and type I, II and III interferons (IFN-a, IFN-c, IFN-k) to evaluate physiological regulation of antigen presentation in our system and to define its dynamical range. Pretreatment of Huh6.1 cells with IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a led to an enhancement of CD8 + T cell activation, while IL-4 and TGF-b, as expected, did not have a stimulating effect (Fig. 1B) . However, type I and II IFNs, well-known stimulants of antigen presentation [15] as well as a type III IFN and IL-27, which was reported to have IFN-c-like effects on hepatocytes [16] stimulated functional antigen presentation in Huh6.1 cells even stronger (Fig. 1B) . Furthermore, alterations in HLA-A \u2044 02 surface expression of Huh6.1 target cells upon treatment with different cytokines correlated with changes in their antigen presentation potency (Fig. 1C) .",

In striking contrast, alisporivir pretreatment of Huh6.1 target cells dose-dependently increased the percentage of activated CD8 + T cells, suggesting a stimulation of the antigen presentation capacity of Huh6.1 by alisporivir (Fig. 2C ). We used 2 or 4 lM alisporivir in all subsequent experiments since this concentration range was regarded as physiologically relevant, based on its efficacy to inhibit HCV replication in vitro and in vivo [18, 19] . Next, Huh6.1 cells were pretreated for different times with alisporivir to explore the kinetics of immunostimulation. A 24 h pretreatment only had minor effects, whereas 48 h after treatment, the increase of CD8 + T cell activation reached a plateau and remained stable for at least 6 days (Fig. 2D) , arguing for a slow and accumulating process increasing antigen presentation by alisporivir.

Assuming that the amount of MHC-I/peptide on the cell surface is a limiting factor of antigen-specific T cell activation, we measured surface HLA-A \u2044 02 on Huh6.1 cells after different times of alisporivir treatment (Fig. 3A, B) . Indeed, alisporivir slowly and continuously enhanced HLA-A \u2044 02 and beta-2-microglobulin (b2m) surface expression over time (Fig. 3A, B) . To assess whether this effect was restricted to Huh6.1 cells we analyzed further liver-derived cell lines (Fig. 3C ). Since these cell lines, apart from HepG2, endogenously expressed HLA alleles differing from HLA-A \u2044 02 we measured their b2m surface expression, which was indeed significantly upregulated in Huh6.1, Huh7_Lunet, HepG2 and HepaRG after 48 h of alisporivir treatment compared to DMSO controls ( Fig. 3C-E) . Analogous results were obtained with an MHC-I specific antibody (Supplementary Fig. 2A, B) . Furthermore, alisporivir treatment significantly enhanced MHC-I surface expression on lung epithelial (A549) cells and a similar trend was observed for further cell lines of non-hepatic origin ( Supplementary Fig. 2C, D) .",

In line with these data, MHC-I protein levels in Huh6.1 or HepaRG cells were not altered by alisporivir, in contrast to IFN-c treatment (Fig. 4B ). In addition, we found a slight but arguing against a mechanism involving regulation of HLA gene expression (Fig. 4C ). An enhancement of MHC-I surface expression by alisporivir could also be caused by a general effect on protein surface expression, in line with a previous study reporting an upregulation of pathways associated with protein trafficking by CsA analog NIM-811 [20] . However, neither surface expression of IFN-c-receptor chain 1 (IFN-cR1) , a type I transmembrane protein like MHC-I a-chain nor CD13, which is like MHC-I cotranslationally glycosylated inside the endoplasmic reticulum and transported through the Golgi to the cell surface [21] , was affected by alisporivir treatment (Fig. 4D) .

Interestingly, CsA also increased MHC-I surface expression, but still entirely blocked functional antigen presentation to T cells by a yet to be defined mechanism [7] . Upregulation of MHC-I surface expression was confirmed in a panel of cell lines of diverse origins and not due to changes in total MHC-I expression levels. Furthermore, alisporivir specifically upregulated MHC-I since neither expression of other surface proteins (CD13, IFN-cR1) nor overall protein secretion was modified. We also could not find evidence for an impact of alisporivir on MHC-I trafficking, endocytosis or degradation, although we cannot exclude that we missed subtle effects in MHC-I transport dynamics, due to limitations of available assays. Still, we favor a mechanism mediated by enhancing peptide amounts available for MHC-I loading, since the stimulatory effect of alisporivir, but not regular MHC-I surface expression, was completely abrogated by proteasome-inhibitors. We hypothesize, that inhibition of the chaperone-like functions of Cyps by alisporivir might enhance peptide pools available for presentation on MHC-I by increasing the amount of unfolded proteins [24] .

            "text": "Cyps are a group of peptidyl-prolyl cis trans isomerases, including at least 17 family members in humans, most of which are poorly studied regarding their inhibition by Cyp-inhibitors and their molecular function [20, 27] . Most Cyp-inhibitors are not restricted to Cyps, but also act against additional targets, like ABC-transporters or Calcineurin [24] . An involvement of Cyps in MHC-I surface upregulation was supported by the fact that all Cyp-inhibitors tested increased MHC-I surface expression, in contrast to FK506, an inhibitor of a different class of peptidyl-prolyl cis trans isomerases [5] and two ABC-transporter inhibitors, reversan and piperine [13] . However, PSC833 and CsH, CsA analogs with reduced affinity for the best studied Cyps [20, 26] induced the same phenotype as observed for CsA, alisporivir and SFA, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of CypA and CypB, the most common Cyps, did not affect MHC-I surface expression, as well as individual knockdown of several other Cyps (data not shown). Altogether, our results either point to a potential role of less studied Cyps, which can still be blocked by all compounds [27] or to a redundant role of many Cyps. Due to the variety of potential targets, the possible involvement of several Cyps with analogous functions, we did not attempt to further define specific Cyps potentially involved in regulation of MHC-I surface expression. For the same reasons and due to high abundance of many Cyps, we neither carried out Cyp-overexpression. Alisporivir, as well as other non-immunosuppressive Cyp-inhibitors like SCY-635 have been in clinical development for antiviral therapy of chronically HCV-infected patients [2] [3] [4] and represent potential broad-spectrum antiviral drugs since many viruses depend on CypA as host factor [5, 28] . Based on our in vitro data, we speculate that alisporivir exerts an immunostimulatory effect on hepatocyte antigen presentation during therapy of chronically HCV-infected patients which might complement its antiviral properties by supporting an efficient adaptive immune response. Stimulation of the antigen presentation capacity of hepatocytes, which normally express only low levels of MHC-I [17] might promote recognition of infected cells by CD8 + T cells and finally contribute to their clearance. As previously reported, IFN-free therapy of HCV-infected patients with direct acting antivirals, but not IFN-based treatment, has the potential, to restore functional T cell responses presumably by lowering high antigen levels, which may support T cell exhaustion [29] . Along these lines, it seems plausible, that alisporivir, if applied as an IFNfree regimen, could restore T cell responses even more efficiently and additionally promote clearance of infected cells by CD8 + T cells via enhancing functional antigen presentation. Indeed, immunomodulatory activities on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HCV-infected patients have been observed in clinical trials of the Cyp-inhibitor SCY-635 [30] . To gain insights into the contribution of these immunostimulatory effects of Cyp-inhibitors to the cure of HCV infections, future clinical studies should also monitor the development of T cell responses during therapy. Alternatively, testing the drug in suitable animal models allowing thorough quantification of T cell responses could further shed light on the impact of alisporivir on adaptive immune responses in various organs in vivo. In conclusion, we could demonstrate that non-immunosuppressive Cyp-inhibitors, in striking contrast to CsA, increase functional antigen presentation by upregulation of MHC-I surface expression. Importantly, the enhanced antigen presentation upon alisporivir treatment might also support clearance of other viruses which are sensitive to Cyp-inhibitors.",
