On one hand this could be a vital step in stemming the spread of the virus, however, on the other there are likely to be issues related to the impact of this lockdown on patients with diabetes; the worsening of hyperglycaemia an increase in diabetes-related complications. This could be due to the limitation of free space to exercise, limited resources to implement a healthy lifestyle, restrictions on the availability of anti-hyperglycaemic agents and difficulty in obtaining of physician's guidance. Further, because of limitations of transport of goods and movement of patients, there is likely to be shortage of drugs, insulin, and glucose testing strps and glucose meters. All these factors have the potential to increase the stress level and its associated impact on the pre-existing disease.",

Assuming a uniform baseline HBA1c derived from the DiabCare study which is the latest epidemiological database on diabetes and its complications in India, the post-lockdown HBA1c increases from baseline as the duration of lockdown got extended (example- HBA1c of +2.26% with a 30 days lockdown to +3.68% with 90 days lockdown).

We demonstrated an incremental increase in both HBA1c as well as diabetes-related complications, with the increase in the duration of lockdown days. A pre-planned strategy must be put in place to prevent such a scenario as poorly controlled diabetes is an independent risk factor of mortality from COVID19.",

Hence inserting the mean baseline HBA1c from the DiabCare study i.e. 8.9%, we calculated the post-disaster predicted HBA1c (Table 3). These predicted data should be accepted only if no major intervention (major changes in treatment by physician, initiation of insulin therapy etc.) is done.Step 5Having established the relationship between the days of lockdown and the predicted end-of-lockdown HBA1c, the posterior diabetes-related complication rates were calculated, taking the baseline data from the DiabCare study (12) at a baseline HBA1c of 8.9% (Table 3).\n",
