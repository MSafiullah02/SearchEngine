For example, the first three deaths related to in Hong Kong all occurred in people with diabetes. In a large series, 173 cases of 1099 laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 cases (16%) in China were classified as severe [3] . Sixteen percent of those with severe disease had diabetes; in contrast only 5.7% of the remaining 926 cases with mild disease had diabetes. Likewise, 24% of those with severe disease had hypertension, compared to 13% among those with mild disease, highlighting the increased risk of adverse outcomes among those with chronic diseases like diabetes.",

ACE2 is present in cardiac, kidney, lung and intestinal tissue, and by converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, it counteracts the effects of angiotensin II and promotes vasodilation. In a similar manner to the coronavirus that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 utilizes ACE2 on the surfaces of epithelial cells to bind and gain entry to infected cells [4, 5] .",

            "text": "Diabetes and conditions such as hypertension are associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin system in different tissues. Furthermore, people with diabetes and hypertension are often treated with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which can lead to increased expression of ACE2, thereby facilitating viral uptake and increasing the risk of severe infection for people with diabetes [6] . Whilst these observations have led to suggestions that switching people on renin-angiotensin system blockers to other agents may modify disease risk [6] , this would be premature and unwarranted in the absence of any experimental evidence to support this approach. On the contrary, treatment with ARBs has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 [7] , supported by observations that blocking the renin-angiotensin system in animal models attenuated the lung injury caused by the SARS-CoV, which also utilizes ACE2 [8] . A recent position statement from the European Society of Cardiology also strongly recommends that physicians and patients continue treatment with their usual anti-hypertensive treatment and that there is no clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be discontinued because of the COVID-19 infection [9] . \u00aa 2020 Diabetes UK Direct infection, however, is not the only issue for people with diabetes. The infection and outbreak has challenged the delivery of healthcare in many ways. Healthcare professionals in hospitals may be re-deployed to caring for the increasing caseloads of people admitted with fever and suspected disease, and the workforce may be further diminished as healthcare providers become affected by the disease. Clinic visits may be postponed and treatment for diabetesrelated issues may be delayed. There may be an unwillingness of people with diabetes to expose themselves to potential infection and so they may avoid attendance at hospitals, clinics and retinal screening, although this may be overcome to a certain extent by utilising phone or video consultations or other forms of communication. As healthcare delivery becomes increasingly interrupted and fragmented, access to basic medical supplies such as insulin may become increasingly difficult, somewhat akin to the challenges faced in other natural disasters. Panic buying has already made it harder for people with diabetes to obtain alcohol wipes or gel to perform hygiene before injection or glucose monitoring in some regions.",

Back in March 2003, almost exactly 17 years ago, several Asian countries and subsequently other countries were hit by the SARS outbreak caused by the SARS coronavirus [10] . Since then, many measures have been implemented in the region to prevent similar outbreaks of infectious diseases. For example, in Hong Kong, these measures include increasing distances between inpatient beds, and provision of negative-pressure ventilation rooms and isolation wards in all major public hospitals. There are defined protocols for protection against aerosol-generating procedures, as well as a public health response alert system. Perhaps most important of all, however, is the response and attitude of the general public. Having experienced the threat of a major infectious disease outbreak, the population as a whole has developed a high degree of awareness, tenacity and preparedness in doing their part to help avoid transmission.",

Also called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), this virus causes the disease COVID-19. This sample was isolated from a patient in the USA. SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It is an enveloped RNA (ribonucleic acid) virus. The coronaviruses take their name from their crown (corona) of surface proteins, which are used to attach and penetrate their host cells. As of mid-March 2020, over 230,000 people have been infected with over 9,500 deaths.",
