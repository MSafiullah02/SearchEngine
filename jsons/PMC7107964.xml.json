Subsequently, the purified RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using random hexamers (Applied Biosystems). Thereafter, purified DNA and cDNA were used as input in individual real-time PCR reactions and were amplified using the Sequence Detection System 7700 (Applied Biosystems). Detection of amplified products was performed using pathogen-specific FAM-dye\u2014labeled TaqMan probes. All pathogens were detected in parallel amplification reactions in 1 assay run. In addition, positive controls and negative controls were included in each run for each individual pathogen. An assay result was validated on the basis of preset Ct-criteria for both the internal control and the positive controls.",

For example, community-acquired pneumonia is responsible for \u223c500,000 hospitalizations in the United States each year, and the annual costs of treating these patients is approximately $9.7 billion [2, 3, 21, 22]. In addition, there is considerable overuse of antibiotics in the treatment of LRTI, especially for viral infections [23]. Unnecessary antibiotic use is regarded as a driving force in the global increase of antibiotic resistance. The clinical value of conventional diagnostic methods, such as microbiological culturing or Gram staining, in guiding treatment of LRTI is limited, because of low sensitivity and considerable delay in obtaining results [24\u201328]. Because of small fractions of positive samples, Gram staining of sputum specimens probably cannot lead to great decreases in antibiotic use or costs [29]. Therefore, improvements of diagnostic methods and policies to decrease antibiotic use in patients with LRTI are necessary. Recently, a promising method has been evaluated: the measurement of procalcitonin serum levels for patients with clinical symptoms of LRTI resulted in a significant decrease in antibiotic use without an adverse effect on patient outcome, especially among patients with acute bronchitis [30].",

Drawbacks of these studies were the use of immunofluorescence techniques, which are less sensitive for virus detection in adult patients [32, 33], and the use of historical control subjects for evaluation of costs and outcomes. In addition, comparisons were made only for those patients with viral infections identified. In the present study, the use of sensitive real-time PCRs for all patients admitted with LRTI did not increase the economic benefits, compared with the contemporary control group.",

An increased diagnostic yield could be achieved by adding more pathogens to the test panel, such as the recently discovered human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses [10, 34], or by performing real-time PCR on sputum samples rather than on nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens. However, only 49% of patients in our study cohort produced adequate sputum samples. Because the duration of symptoms at the time of PCR was inversely related to the likelihood of having positive test results, performance of real-time PCR earlier during the course of LRTI might also increase the diagnostic yield. In The Netherlands, most patients are first seen by their general practitioner, and only those patients who have a more severe clinical presentation or who are not responding to empirical treatment are referred to the hospital. Whether real-time PCR will be cost-beneficial in outpatient clinics, in general-practice populations, or in regions where patients are not initially seen by general practitioners remains to be determined.",

For example, patients admitted in the winter season, with a recent onset of symptoms, low C-reactive protein levels, and absence of infiltrates on chest radiographs were most likely to have viral pathogens detected. Limiting real-time PCR tests to these high-risk patients may increase cost-effectiveness. Finally, physicians were hesitant to discontinue antibiotic treatment even if PCR detected a virus, possibly because bacterial culture results were available only after PCR results were available. It is, therefore, doubtful that more rapid reporting of results, which may be possible in the near future with more expensive automated systems, will lead to improved cost-effectiveness.",
