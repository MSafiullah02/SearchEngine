Moreover, most teams are small in number; the average 2017 full-time equivalent for a consult service is two for lesser than 150-bed hospitals and 5.5 for greater than 300-bed hospitals.7 There is little redundancy. Thus, most palliative care teams cannot afford to lose a single team member to a prolonged illness like COVID-19. To best protect this limited resource, is important to keep existing palliative care providers free from COVID-19 if possible.",

To help facilitate primary palliative care, palliative care consult teams can help create guidelines or order sets for the management of typical COVID-19 symptoms. Whenever possible, these guidelines should be developed with the cooperation of other services affected by this crisis (e.g., critical care, emergency medicine, and hospital medicine).",

Teams should consider having talking points at the ready for needs that are likely to arise in the care of COVID-19 patients; such as management of cough, secretions, and shortness of breath; communication of triaging decisions; and management of family grief. If primary teams become overwhelmed with patients, palliative care consult services with the capacity can offset the responsibility of keeping patients' families informed. It is especially important to ensure families are informed when patients take a turn for the worse and/or die; in Italy, there have been instances where families were not informed of their loved ones' passing for days.9 To facilitate the sharing of communication responsibilities, we recommend scheduled daily card flips with the directors of COVID-19 units in the hospital or the intensive care unit.",

Of course, palliative care providers should follow all standard precautions and refrain from physical touch, including noninfected members of patients' families. Whenever possible, consideration should be given to interviewing patients or families by phone.

Palliative care providers should give caregivers of COVID-19 patients anticipatory guidance about what hospice will and will not be able to do.

The lack of a clear national consensus as to the criteria used to ration life-sustaining treatment will make decisions appear arbitrary, further compounding the challenge. Palliative care providers may be asked to be the bearers of bad news in this context and will be tasked to help patients and families cope with repercussions. Those palliative care providers who are perceived by the patient and family as part of the \u201cdeath panel\u201d who decided to not offer life support will have a very difficult time establishing the trust that is necessary to comfort patients and families and help them move forward. For this reason, we strongly recommend that palliative care teams not participate in the crafting of guidelines to ration care or in clinical decision making about the value of life-sustaining therapies for individual patients. More than ever, our patients and families need to view us as neutral. When there are questions regarding individual patients and the value of life support, palliative care providers can encourage the use of case conferences (where multiple experts discuss the specifics of an individual case and craft a recommended course) and ethics consultation.",

Providers should avoid terms like futility, which can promote an adversarial relationship with the family. Providers should reassure patients and families that they will not be abandoned and that patients will continue to receive compassionate care regardless of candidacy for life-sustaining treatment.",
