Due to the absence of clinical symptoms such as fever and cough, infected patients who were in the incubation period of the disease or the asymptomatic patients were treated as ordinary patients without preventive isolation and protection measures. In addition, some patients do not report any recent travel history to the pandemic regions or history of close contact with patients with COVID-19. These patients will also become a source of infection in hospitals if they were treated as ordinary patients without preventive isolation.3\n",

Some patients are treated as ordinary patients if the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid of their throat swab is negative. However, the positive rate of throat swab nucleic acid test is low. Some patients need to be tested repeatedly to confirm the diagnosis. It should be noted that the positive rate of sputum and alveolar lavage fluid nucleic acid test is more sensitive than the throat swab. In addition, it is worth noting that some patients who recovered from COVID-19 still showed a positive nucleic acid test even after hospitalization. These patients would be a source of infection in hospitals if there were no effective isolation measures in place.",

Patients who have not been ruled out of COVID-19 for emergency surgery are treated as suspected cases. Similarly, patients with related clinical symptoms (fever, cough, history of travel to infected regions, close contact with COVID-19 pneumonia, and patients with positive chest radiologic imaging), even if their nucleic acid testing is negative, should be treated as the suspected cases. The nucleic acid testing must be repeated to prevent the missed diagnosis of COVID-19 in these patients.",

It is worth noting that a rehabilitation station should be established for discharged patients who meet the discharge standards but continue to be isolated for 14 days to prevent them from becoming a source of infection again.",
