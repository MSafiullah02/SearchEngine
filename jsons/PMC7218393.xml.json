As He et al mentioned, chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have a high rate of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in hemodialysis (HD) centers. Therefore, we once again call on medical providers to pay special attention to SARS-CoV-2 infection of dialysis patients.",

While nearly 10% of renal transplantation patients suffered from polyomavirus-associated nephropathy. Thereafter, it was generally accepted that intense immunosuppression might be a risk factor for BKV nephropathy [2].",

The results indicate higher severity and mortality among these immunosuppressed patients. The authors point out that treatment can be divided into two phases. The first phase is associated with viral replication, for which antiviral drugs may be considered. The second phase involves lung and cytokine release syndromes, for which immunomodulatory drugs may be of benefit [3]. Furthermore, Zhu et al [4] enrolled ten renal transplant recipients with COVID-19 and ten of their family members diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia as a control group. They found that the transplant recipients had more severe disease and a longer virus shedding time than those in the control group. After a regimen involving cessation or reduction of immunosuppressive agents and administration of antiviral and supportive treatment, nine of the ten patients survived. The authors concluded that immunosuppression may have two opposing effects on the disease: making the early course of infection more severe and reducing mortality by suppressing the overactive immune response, in agreement with the opinions of Alberici et al.",
