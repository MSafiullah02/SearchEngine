By the end of February, clusters of patients were observed in Hong Kong mainly related to close contacts and health-care workers [1]. On March 12th , the WHO initiated a worldwide alert, the disease rapidly spread around the world [2]. Initially a metapneumovirus was isolated from several patients but rapidly a new coronavirus, the SARS coronavirus, was isolated [3] and fulfilled Koch\u2019s postulates. Hematological manifestations in SARS were precisely described; lymphopenia and T lymphocytes depletion are often associated with the disease activity [4]. We report the case of a patient with a SARS related-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the evolution was characterized with two episodes of ARDS associated with a specific cytokine production pattern.",

The patient left Hanoi on March 22nd to travel to Paris. During the travel he developed a shortness of breath and was admitted on March 23rd in the Infectious Diseases Department (Tourcoing, France). On admission, he was febrile (39 \u00b0C), presented a tachycardia (100/min), the patient was also hypoxemic (SaO2: 88%) with a high respiratory rate (20/min) and rapidly required oxygen supplementation. Chest radiography showed a bilateral opacification with both interstitial and alveolar involvement. The initial treatment associated ceftriaxone and ofloxacin, with ribavirin. The patient remained stable for 6 h before worsening his ventilatory status. He was transferred in the ICU on the 24th, non invasive ventilation was started for 3 h and finally the patient was intubated and sedated. On March 24th, laboratory abnormalities showed a PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 92, elevated levels of aspartate amino-transferase (54 U/l), and white blood cells (15 700 cells/mm3).",

Tracheal samples were still positive for the SARS coronavirus on April 19th, stools started to be positive on 14th April, we therefore cannot rule out a possible exacerbation of the SARS infection related to corticosteroids tapering. The other possibility could be a rebound following corticosteroids withdrawal, in fact, each time the dose reached 10\u201320 mg/d, clinical status worsened.

Produced by TH2 cells as well as other cells, IL-4 is a growth and differentiation factor for activated B-lymphocytes and activated T-lymphocytes which promotes production of TH2 cells and IgE by B-lymphocytes. IL-4 enhances macrophage antigen processing and presentation activity and induces other cytokine production. In sepsis, this cytokine increases at the time of diagnosis and is correlated with mortality [7]. In ARDS, Li et al. [8] showed an increase of IL-4 levels to 261 \u00b1 55 \u03bcg/l compared to 43 \u00b1 13 \u03bcg/l in controls, in our study, the levels reached only 13.1 \u03bcg/l but was always produced prior to the clinical deterioration. We systematically sampled the patient each day 8 a.m., the measurement performed on April 19th, which showed an increase of IL-4, was realized on a stable extubated patient with no sign of respiratory distress. Similarly, for the next exacerbation in the end of May, IL-4 levels were increased before the third ARDS.",
