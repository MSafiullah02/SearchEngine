Furthermore, the use of left-over material received for routine diagnostic purposes could have resulted in suboptimal times between sample collection and storage at -80\u00b0C due to transport and diagnostic processing time, resulting in a loss in infectivity and an underestimation of the initial number of viable viral particles. This might have led to a decreased titer of infectious virus and a failure of virus isolation even in the presence of high viral RNA levels. Of note, 2 of 3 samples with a high viral RNA level but unsuccessful virus isolation were collected outside our institution, and thus had longer transport times to the laboratory; the last one was collected in our institution, but the time between specimen collection and processing was 24 hours. The vast majority of patients were managed as outpatients and had to self-isolate at home after diagnosis, so no consecutive sampling was possible to assess infectious virus in multiple samples over the course of disease.

Most patients had an upper respiratory tract infection (n=13), followed by fever without source and pneumonia (each, n=2). Samples were collected at a median of 2 days (IQR 1-3) after symptom onset. Median viral load (VL) at time of diagnosis was 3.0x106 copies/ml (mean 4,4x108, IQR 6.9x103-4.4x108) from a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) (Supplementary Table 1). SARS-CoV-2 virus isolation was successful in 12/23 (52%) children after inoculating VeroE6 cells with a NPS specimen. SARS-CoV-2 isolation was determined by the presence of a typical cytopathic effect (CPE) (Supplementary Figure 1) and increased viral RNA in the supernatant.
