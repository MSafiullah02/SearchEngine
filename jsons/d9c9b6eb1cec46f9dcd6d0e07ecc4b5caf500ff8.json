These recombinant proteins have a wide range of important applications, including vaccines and therapeutics for human and animal health, industrial enzymes, new materials and components of novel nano-particles for various applications. The majority of recombinant proteins are produced by traditional biological ''factories,'' that is, predominantly mammalian and microbial cell cultures along with yeast and insect cells. However, these traditional technologies cannot satisfy the increasing market demand due to prohibitive capital investment requirements. During the last two decades, plants have been under intensive investigation to provide an alternative system for cost-effective, highly scalable, and safe production of recombinant proteins. Although the genetic engineering of plant viral vectors for heterologous gene expression can be dated back to the early 1980s, recent understanding of plant virology and technical progress in molecular biology have allowed for significant improvements and fine tuning of these vectors. These breakthroughs enable the flourishing of a variety of new viral-based expression systems and their wide application by academic and industry groups. In this review, we describe the principal plant viral-based production strategies and the latest plant viral expression systems, with a particular focus on the variety of proteins produced and their applications.

Increasing efforts, however, have been focused on designing new molecules with more desirable characteristics and/or functionality. Pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes were the first recombinant biotech products on the world market and biopharmaceuticals were the majority of commercialized recombinant proteins (Pavlou and Reichert, 2004) . Many protein-based drugs, similar to traditional small molecule pharmaceuticals, function as antagonists by binding to and thereby inhibiting the activity of their target, such as an enzyme or a receptor. Classical protein antagonists include full monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), their single-chain derivatives (ScFv) and mAb-fusion proteins. Recent research programs have also focused on non-antibody antagonists that consist of a scaffold protein displaying the inserted affinity peptide (Walsh, 2006) . Recombinant DNA technology also provided an excellent alternative for developing safer vaccines. Subunit vaccines are based on immunodominant protein components of a pathogen, but do not contain its genetic material. Consequently they cannot replicate, cause disease, or introduce pathogens into non-endemic regions. Viral coat proteins are exceptional subunit vaccine candidates and in some cases are able to form virus-like particles (VLPs) when expressed in heterologous systems. In fact, the only recombinant subunit vaccines presently available are based on VLPs. They are highly immunogenic and able to induce both humoral and cellular responses (Chackerian, 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 439, "end": 466, "text": "(Pavlou and Reichert, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 957, "end": 970, "text": "(Walsh, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1643, "text": "(Chackerian, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In addition to the pharmaceutical industry, many other fields are also relying intensely on recombinant proteins.

Stable transformation of the chloroplast offers several distinct advantages in areas of transgene targeting, product yield, and regulatory compliance. Since the chloroplast genome allows for homologous recombination, transgenes can be precisely targeted to a specific locus of the genome to avoiding positional effect or accidental gene knock-outs. Each plant cell has several chloroplasts and each of these contains many circular genomes. Therefore, the shear copy number of the transgene enables high-level expression of the target recombinant protein. Since the chloroplast is inherited maternally, this technology reduces the risk of potential transgene escape by pollen dissemination. Similar to bacterial cells, however, the chloroplast is unable to perform typical eukaryotic posttranslational modifications, such as glycosylation.

Fortunately, technical advances in molecular biology such as generating cDNA from an RNA template have enabled us to expand our search for expression systems into single stranded RNA viruses, the most represented types of plant viruses in nature. Another technical breakthrough was the use of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to promote viral infection (Grimsley et al., 1986; Turpen et al., 1993) . Generally, viral infection can be initiated by mechanical inoculation of infectious viral particles on leaves or alternatively by transfection of nucleic acids. The use of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, known as ''agroinfection,'' allows the direct and efficient targeting of cDNA to the plant cell nucleus (Fig. 1) . The cDNA constructs in the plant expression cassette would result in an infectious, autonomously replicating nucleic acid after host cell nuclear transcription and processing.

The first successful expression of a foreign gene ever achieved in plants was obtained using a substitution vector based on the CaMV. Usually, the coat protein (CP) gene is the viral coding sequence of choice to be replaced. However, with a few exceptions, the CP is essential for cell to cell and/or systemic movement and infection. However, caution has to be taken if leaves of the whole plants are intended to be infected. For example, a CP replacement vector was developed using the tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV). In this case the CP is not essential for systemic movement of the virus in certain species of Nicotiana (Scholthof et al., 1993) and it was indeed demonstrated that the insertion of a heterologous gene supports a systemic infection (Scholthof et al., 1993) . In TMV-based substitution vectors, where the CP is necessary for systemic infection, a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT)-CP gene replacement vector generated only local lesions and CAT activity was confined on the inoculated leaf (Takamatsu et al., 1987) . In another recently developed TMV-based gene substitution vector the CP gene was exchanged with the gene of interest fused to a thermostable carrier molecule, the beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase enzyme (lichenase) of Clostridium thermocellum, to facilitate target expression, stability and purification. The heat tolerant property of the lichenase (658C) allows easy target proteins purification by heat treatment which precipitates up to 50% of contaminating plant proteins.

They are capable of cell to cell and systemic movement and infection. Viruses with both spherical and rod shaped virions have been investigated. Viruses with rod-shaped particles have a better potential due to fewer constraints on the amount of nucleic acid inserted. However, there is still a limit on the genome size of the chimeric rod-shaped virion based vectors. It has been proven that chimeric vectors with genome size beyond certain limits resulted in unsustained virion assembly. Two of the most famous gene insertion vectors have been derived from TMV and potato virus X (PVX). Both viruses have a single stranded positive RNA genome. They use subgenomic promoters and consequently subgenomic RNAs to express some of their ORFs and have a helical virion symmetry which results in rod-shaped particles. A chimeric TMV was constructed with the CAT gene inserted between the movement protein (MP) gene and the CP gene; the expression was regulated by an additional copy of the subgenomic promoter of the CP gene that, as a result, was duplicated in the hybrid vector. The vector was able to replicate, to form subgenomic RNAs, to assemble correctly, and to produce reporter gene activity. Nevertheless the duplication of the subgenomic promoter sustained homologous recombination causing instability and the consequent loss of the exogenous gene (Dawson et al., 1989) . This problem was solved by using a subgenomic CP promoter derived from a different virus belonging to the Tobamovirus genus to prevent homologous recombination. Similar problems and solutions of recombination between duplicated subgenomic promoters were reported in a recent insertion vector system based on the grapevine virus A (GVA) for N. benthamiana (Haviv et al., 2006) . Analogous to TMV, a PVX-based vector was generated using the duplicated promoter of the CP gene. However in this case the vector was stable and able to retain the additional coding sequence (Chapman et al., 1992) . Nevertheless, recently it has been demonstrated that the size of the inserted gene of interest can play a crucial role in the stability of the modified PVX expression vector, with a positive correlation between the elimination rate of the gene of interest and its length (Avesani et al., 2007) . Recombination can involve homologous CP promoter sequences but also other mechanisms mediated by both the host plant and the virus (Avesani et al., 2007) . Another well established system is based on Cowpea Mosaic Virus (CPMV) the type member of Comoviridae whose bipartite genome is constituted by single stranded positive RNA molecules. RNA-1 encodes for proteins involved in replication while RNA-2 carries the genetic information for the movement and structural proteins. The system is very versatile; it can be utilized in a totally transient fashion, co-infiltrating wild-type plants with two separate c-DNA constructs representing RNA-1 to sustain amplification and RNA-2 harboring the gene of interest, or it can be utilized combining transgenic plants with virus-mediated transient expression. In this case the RNA-2 is used for stable transformation and the RNA-1, necessary to prime the active replication of RNA-2 and of the heterologous gene, is supplemented by agro-infiltration. It is worth noticing that a deleted version of RNA-2, unable to produce infectious clones, it has also been utilized to prevent possible environmental containment concerns (Liu et al., 2005; Sainsbury et al., 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1494, "end": 1515, "text": "(Dawson et al., 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1873, "end": 1893, "text": "(Haviv et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2086, "end": 2108, "text": "(Chapman et al., 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2382, "end": 2404, "text": "(Avesani et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2538, "end": 2560, "text": "(Avesani et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3573, "end": 3591, "text": "(Liu et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 3592, "end": 3615, "text": "Sainsbury et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Plant Viral Vectors"}, {"text": "In conclusion it is possible to obtain an inducible expression system if RNA-1 is supplemented by agroinfiltration and a constitutive stable expression system if it is supplemented by crossing with an RNA-1 stable transgenic line (Canizares et al., 2006) . Modular or deconstructed vectors are a new generation of viral expression systems. Their development was driven by the understanding that: (1) not all viral components are essential or beneficial for an expression vector and (2) viruses can be broken down into different genomic elements that would still operate together in the infection process as wild-type multipartite genome viruses. Moreover, agroinfection provided the technical possibility to co-deliver multiple different components. Hence in modular systems, viral components are separated into distinct portions and inserted into binary vectors contained in an Agrobacterium strain. The strains are mixed together and co-infiltrated into plant leaves. This strategy allows the replicative portion, the so called replicon, to be reduced in size, down to minimal to accommodate the insertion of transgene, while other viral components necessary for the vector function can be provided in trans during the infection process. At present, one of the most famous and broadly used vector is the deconstructed system based on TMV and developed by Icon Genetics (Halle, Germany), recently acquired by Bayer Innovation GmbH. The vector has been engineered to divide the TMV genome into two major cDNA modules: a 5 0 module which contains the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase and the MP, and a 3 0 module that carries the gene of interest and the 3 0 untranslated region (UTR) of the virus essential for the efficient replication and amplification of the vector. In this particular case, viral functions are not complemented in trans but the two modules actually assemble together in vivo by a site specific recombinase delivered by a third Agrobacterium cell line. Furthermore, different 5 0 modules carry different organelle targeting signals which, fuse in frame with the gene of interest after recombination and nuclear processing, allow a single construct to be combined pair wise with various targeting elements in separate constructs. This feature greatly facilitates the experimental procedure to test optimal expression in terms of accumulation in different sub-cellular compartments. An additional attribute of the vector, that permitted a dramatic enhancement of expression levels, was the introduction of several introns in the coding sequences of the 5 0 module (Marillonnet et al., 2004 . Levels of expression are impressive and can reach up to 5 mg of recombinant protein per gram of fresh weight (FW). The system was extensively tested with different genes, coding for antibodies and antibody-derivatives, interferons, growth hormones, bacterial and viral antigens, adjuvants and enzymes , confirming each time its versatility and robustness.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 230, "end": 254, "text": "(Canizares et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2584, "end": 2609, "text": "(Marillonnet et al., 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Plant Viral Vectors"}, {"text": "Another interesting modular system was developed using the bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV) of the Geminiviridae family. Geminivirus are single stranded circular DNA viruses known to replicate through the rolling circle process, promoting high level of genome amplification in the nucleus of the infected cell.

The basic version involves two modules, one containing the gene of interest inserted between the BeYDV long and short intragenic regions, LIR and SIR respectively. Both intragenic regions are necessary to sustain rolling circle replication. The gene of interest is driven by a strong plant specific constitutive promoter. The second module is responsible for the expression of the Rep protein which catalyzes various aspects of the rolling circle replication. Initially, the system was used as an expression vector in tobacco plant cell culture (Mor et al., 2003) but its use has recently been extended to whole leaves with agroinfection. The modular nature of this system also permits the co-expression of a variety of sequences of different viral or non-viral origin that are beneficial for replicon amplification and transgene expression. For example, genes of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) inhibiting proteins can be co-expressed to prevent PTGS and hence enhance target protein accumulation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1008, "end": 1026, "text": "(Mor et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Plant Viral Vectors"}, {"text": "Display viral vectors have been extensively used to provide a molecular scaffolding for different kinds of peptides to be fused with the viral CP and, therefore, to be exposed and displayed on the surface of chimeric virus particles (CVPs). Coat protein genes of several plant viruses were genetically modified to support fusions with coding sequences of heterologous peptides in specific regions known to be well exposed on the virion surface (Johnson et al., 1997; Porta and Lomonossoff, 1998) . Therefore, the virus and the plant host would provide the expression system to produce large quantities of the chimeric fusion protein. Clearly this is only feasible for well characterized viruses in terms of assembly, movement strategies and structure. Fusions must be compatible with the normal assembly and viral fitness, and must avoid any possible steric hindrance or interference with virus movement. Defining peptide features for their correct display on CVP is of particular interest among studies in this area (Bendahmane et al., 1999; Porta et al., 2003; Lico et al., 2006) . Two strategies have been developed to overcome assembly problems for long or difficult peptides. One strategy is to modify the 3 0 terminus of the CP gene so that the CP stop codon would function in a leaky fashion. This would cause most of the CP produced to be unfused, while a small portion would be fused to the peptide displayed on the surface (Hamamoto et al., 1993; Sugiyama et al., 1995; Borovsky et al., 2006) . The other strategy employs the 2A peptide of the small foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV). This sequence, inserted between the epitope coding sequence and the 5 0 terminus of the CP gene, produces a ribosomal skip during the translational procedure (Donnelly et al., 2001; de Felipe et al., 2003) , with the result that only a small portion of the translational products will consist in a fusion between the heterologous sequence and the CP (Fig. 2) . The use of these strategies, however, opens the question of the precise dose of the antigen in the vaccine formulation. Many plant viruses have been used to display different kinds of peptides. The most widely used viruses for this purpose are the CPMV, the TMV and the PVX. Extensive research regarding the symmetry, shape and structure at atomic level for these viruses have allowed the precise definition of specific sites for peptide insertion to ensure the successful display of fusion peptides (Klug and Caspar, 1960; Lomonossoff and Johnson, 1991; Baratova et al., 1992a,b; Johnson et al., 1997; Parker et al., 2002) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 444, "end": 466, "text": "(Johnson et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 467, "end": 495, "text": "Porta and Lomonossoff, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1042, "text": "(Bendahmane et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1062, "text": "Porta et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 1063, "end": 1081, "text": "Lico et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1433, "end": 1456, "text": "(Hamamoto et al., 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1479, "text": "Sugiyama et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1502, "text": "Borovsky et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1755, "end": 1778, "text": "(Donnelly et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1779, "end": 1802, "text": "de Felipe et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2458, "end": 2481, "text": "(Klug and Caspar, 1960;", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 2482, "end": 2512, "text": "Lomonossoff and Johnson, 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 2513, "end": 2538, "text": "Baratova et al., 1992a,b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2539, "end": 2560, "text": "Johnson et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2561, "end": 2581, "text": "Parker et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1947, "end": 1955, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Plant Viral Vectors"}, {"text": "Major efforts are now directed to the development of new viral vector typologies in terms of both improvement of the expression strategies and virus choice.

They are responsible for the recognition and binding of target antigens with high affinity and specificity. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used in a wide range of applications, including diagnosis, prevention and treatment of many diseases. For example, they are being successfully utilized as ''targeting vectors'' to direct drugs, radioisotopes and other therapeutic molecules to their target cells or tissues, as immunomodulators in pathology-related functions, as well as diagnostic tools to identify and localize molecular alterations. In addition to their pharmaceutical applications, mAbs can also be used to modulate plant traits, generate disease or pest resistant crops (Tavladoraki et al., 1993; Nolke et al., 2004; Peschen et al., 2004; Villani et al., 2005) , and to study plant metabolic pathways (Nolke et al., 2005) . Antibodies are complex glycoproteins consisting of four polypeptides, linked by disulfide bridges and non-covalent bonds. Despite their complexity, mAbs and their derivatives can be easily expressed in heterologous systems including plants . However, mAbs produced by heterologous systems may not share the precise structural and functional properties of the native molecules. For example, mAbs produced by a bacterial expression system will lack post-translational modifications including glycosylation. Non-mammalian eukaryotic expression systems could fail to use the appropriate glycans groups resulting in different glycosylation patterns. Yeasts, for example, tend to hyperglycosylate (Harashima, 1994; Malissard et al., 1996) ; while plants preferentially introduce xylose and fucose residues and fail to use galactose and syalic acid (Gomord and Faye, 2004) . Although proper glycosylation is required for functions of many mAbs, it is to be noted that different glycosylation patterns do not always lead to loss of function in vitro or in vivo, or cause side-effects in humans (Chargelegue et al., 2000) . Different strategies have been adopted to circumvent these limitations such as targeting mAbs to the endoplasmic reticulum, or abolishing glycosylation sites by mutagenesis to avoid inappropriate glycosylated products. In fact, it has been reported that the absence of glycans in some cases did not interfere with correct assembly and activity (Rodriguez et al., 2005; Nuttall et al., 2005) .

Vaccination has been one of the greatest revolutions in medical science and has dramatically improved the quality and length of life expectancy. Although vaccines are the most cost effective form of disease protection in healthcare, their cost is still too excessive for many people in the world, especially in developing countries. Vaccines can be therapeutic, to overcome an infection already established, or prophylactic, to prevent a future infection. The aim of vaccination strategies is to obtain efficient and safe vaccine formulations to induce a long lasting immunity against various pathogens. To achieve this goal, the vaccine component should generate not only a neutralizing antibody response, a long-term memory B cells stimulation, but also a T cell mediated immunity to eliminate infected cells which represent the pathogen reservoirs. Recombinant subunit vaccines, based on a single protein (antigen) or a single peptide (epitope) derived from the pathogen, are particularly attractive strategies when compared to classic inactivated, attenuated or live recombinant vaccines. Recombinant subunit vaccines offer potentially equivalent efficacy but are much safer and in some cases easier to produce. Plants offer unique advantages for the production of subunit vaccines in terms of scale, speed, costs, yield, and safety.

Rod-shaped viruses, like TMV, have been extensively used in the synthesis of a variety of metals nanowires, magnetic materials and semiconductors. TMV can be used as organic templates for the controlled deposition of gold, silver and platinum to prepare 1-D arrays (Dujardin et al., 2003) . Self-assembled, modified CP monomers of TMV were also employed for the construction of photovoltaic components in a novel light-harvesting system (Miller et al., 2007) . CVPs can be also incorporated in liquid crystal systems or used to generate thin films and fibers (Flynn et al., 2003) .

The unique structure and biochemistry of plant cells and tissues present different challenges and opportunities for each of the above processing steps. In addition, the choice of host plant species, tissue and subcellular organelle targeting of the product will have profound impact on the strategy and outcome of downstream processing efforts.

For small scale preparation, some researchers perform further fractionation of leaves by manually separating the central vein from the rest of leaves. For largescale production, this kind of operation becomes impractical and whole leaves are processed thoroughly in the next step. If the biomaterial is produced in open fields, extra steps have to be performed to remove the diverse array of environmental contaminants. Rinsing and light washing of plants, before harvesting the target tissue, is a common practice for this purpose.

The crude extract will be clarified to separate the protein-containing buffer from plant debris, insoluble proteins (see below) and other particulate matters. In comparison to other production hosts, plants produce more solid debris (up to 30% of totally weight of the biomaterial (Menkhaus et al., 2004) ). The larger and denser solids make it impossible to achieve effective clarification by filtration methods. As a result, continuous centrifugation remains the most effective and scalable technique for plant extract clarification.
