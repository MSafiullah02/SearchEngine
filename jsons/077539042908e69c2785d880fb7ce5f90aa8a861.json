We surveyed 700 households to elicit information on human and animal medicine use and husbandry practices. Households that owned livestock (n = 265/459, 57.7%) reported using animal treatments 630 times during the previous 6 months; 57.6% obtained medicines, including antibiotics, from drug sellers. Government animal healthcare providers were rarely visited (9.7%), and respondents more often sought animal health care from pharmacies and village doctors (70.6% and 11.9%, respectively), citing the latter two as less costly and more successful based on past performance. Animal husbandry practices that could promote the transmission of microbes from animals to humans included the following: the proximity of chickens to humans (50.1% of households reported that the chickens slept in the bedroom); the shared use of natural bodies of water for human and animal bathing (78.3%); the use of livestock waste as fertilizer (60.9%); and gender roles that dictate that females are the primary caretakers of poultry and children (62.8%). In the absence of an effective animal healthcare system, villagers must depend on informal healthcare providers for treatment of their animals.

In the modern poultry industry, antimicrobials are used in high quantitiesnot only for therapy and prevention of bacterial disease but also as antimicrobial growth promoters (AMGPs) in animal feedswhich may constitute the greatest selection pressure for the emergence of resistance (Angulo et al., 2009; Marshall and Levy, 2011) . The faecal flora of chickens, for example, contains a relatively high proportion of resistant bacteria. Studies from high-income countries have reported that poultry are a source of antibiotic resistance for poultry farm workers (van den Bogaard et al., 2002; Price et al., 2007) . Studies from low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) have shown that poultry farm workers and their family members are at an increased risk for carriage of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and diarrhoeal pathogens than the general population (Al-Ghamdi et al., 1999; Raghunath, 2008; Donkor et al., 2012 ) (See Fig. 1 ). In LMIC, people generally live in closer contact with livestock than in highincome countries (HIC) and this is linked to increased risk for diarrhoeal diseases (Al-Ghamdi et al., 1999; Harvey et al., 2003) (See Fig. 1 ). Limited data are available on household-level antibiotic use for humans in Bangladesh, and no data exist on household-level antibiotic use for animals in Bangladesh or in other low-income countries (Hossain et al., 1982) . One of the few published studies on human antibiotic use in Bangladesh suggested a high rate of medicine use; 189 individuals took 261 drugs, patients rarely obtained a full prescription, and about 95% of purchases were from private pharmacies (Hossain et al., 1982) .

Known risk factors for the spread of AMR include household-level variables (crowding, travel, proximity to clinics).

While some have estimated it to contribute more to the overall burden of drug resistance than human use of antibiotics; the attributable fraction of this practice on the burden of antibiotic resistance in clinically important pathogens to humans is unknown (Angulo et al., 2009; Marshall and Levy, 2011) . The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has increased steadily in LMIC since the introduction of antibiotics (Radyowijati and Haak, 2003) . Despite the recognized importance of examining both animal and human antibiotic use at the household level in a LMIC setting, no other studies have been published that report this information. We report frequent animal medicine use at the household level in rural Bangladesh (Sylhet district) and frequent treatment purchase from pharmacies which are indicative of non-human antibiotic use. Respondents reported using medicines in almost a quarter of animal treatment events specifically for diarrhoea and fever more than other treatments, and medicines were recommended and obtained from trained healthcare providers and drug sellers. We conducted qualitative interviews with drug sellers and village doctors to triangulate the findings of this study, and we found that the terms that respondents used for medicines were used by drug sellers and village doctors for antimicrobials (most commonly referring to oxytetracycline and metronidazole). The reported use of medicines may be a proxy for antibiotic use, yet information on the extent of non-human antibiotic use is lacking (Roess, 2006; Roess et al., 2013) . Additives were most often recommended by household members and were a common treatment. As described, additives referred to grain and commercial animal feed that included antimicrobials and were used primarily to treat animals that were in general poor health or were not growing (Roess, 2006) . Living with a household member who was working on a poultry farm or another type of farm was associated with using animal medicines and additives.

Livestock are important culturally: in establishing the status of the farmer as providers of employment to the farmer and family members; as a store of wealth; and as a form of insurance (Riethmuller, Chai et al. 1999) . Livestock provide an opportunity for low-income farmers to accumulate capital, which in turn helps reduce hunger (Riethmuller, Chai et al. 1999; Peeling and Holden, 2004) . The loss of an animal for a small farmer can have severe consequences, such as the loss of a source of income or social standing in the community. These are important justifications for spending a significant portion of household income on animal medicines, health care and other means of protecting livestock.

Respondents provided local terms to describe the products used. To address this limitation and potential source of misclassification bias, we applied the results of our qualitative research to the development of the survey and to the interpretation of our results. In addition to the respondents' use of the same terms for medicines as the healthcare providers used for antibiotics, we found that villagers who reported using animal medicine presented medicine packages or pills that were for antibiotics (Roess, 2006; Roess et al., 2013) . The use of additives (39%) may be indicative of commercial animal feed that may contain antibiotics as previously described. In-depth interviews with personnel of pharmaceutical distribution centres uncovered frequent animal pharmaceutical sales to drug sellers in rural markets during the study period, and more than 50% of animal products sold in any reporting period were antibiotics (Roess, 2006; Roess et al., 2013) . Rationale for animal antibiotic use in rural Bangladesh is similar to that of American farmers in the 1950s and 1960s when agricultural antibiotic use was beginning (McEwen and Fedorka-Cray, 2002 )specifically respondents report that it is an effective way to protect herds of animals who lived in closed quarters from diseases and thus appears to be economically sound. Future studies should examine the prevalence and emergence of antibioticresistant microbes in similar settings in the context of household-level antibiotic use for humans and animals. Due to logistic constraints and the lack of financial resources, we were unable to do so. Nevertheless, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens is quickly outweighing the perceived benefits of animal agricultural antimicrobial use. Several European countries and the European Commission banned avoparcin in animal feed, and this led to a decrease in human cases of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (Angulo et al., 2009) ; similar interventions may be useful in Bangladesh. Another limitation in our study is that it was nested in the comparison arm of an impact evaluation and participants had to meet the inclusion criteria which included the following: be married or divorced or widowed and have a baby <18 months old. It can be argued that families that do not have infants may behave differently with regard to the use of animal household products.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 663, "end": 676, "text": "(Roess, 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 677, "end": 696, "text": "Roess et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1099, "text": "(Roess, 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1119, "text": "Roess et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1317, "text": "(McEwen and Fedorka-Cray, 2002", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2084, "end": 2105, "text": "(Angulo et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Considering the increasing body of evidence that links animal agricultural antibiotic use and suboptimal animal husbandry practices to the emergence of resistant pathogens and the transmission of zoonotic diseases, it is important to adopt measures to prevent such emergence in LMIC settings where a weak health system would not be able to cope with emerging epidemics. Environmental health impacts of agricultural antibiotic use, including the observation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria of animal origin in areas surrounding livestock operations, could also be mitigated by such measures (Landers et al., 2012) . Globalization and the documented epidemics during the study period, most notably severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah-like virus and H5N1, are evidence for the need to strengthen surveillance of emerging diseases, including resistant strains in even remote areas of the world (Xing et al., 2010; Kerkhove, 2013) . In May 2005, the World Health Organization passed an amendment mandating the reporting of seven diseases in member countries (Steiger, 2005) . Although none of these reportable diseases include antibiotic resistance, this important step can be a platform on which surveillance programs can be built to monitor the emergence of resistance in the environment in remote areas. Information gathering of agricultural antibiotic use is necessary to inform treatment recommendations for people in affected areas.
