Early diagnosis plays a vital role in management of fish and shellfish diseases. Traditionally, various biochemical and serological tests have been used for fish disease diagnosis. However, the time and expertise required for such diagnoses makes it difficult for aquaculturists to easily adopt them under production conditions. Polymerase chain reaction and probebased nucleic acid detection have become increasingly popular in fish and shellfish diagnostics. Recently, a novel technique called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been developed, which is highly sensitive and rapid. LAMP has been used for the detection of bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic diseases in both animal and plants. In aquaculture, LAMP-based detection of pathogens like Edwardsiella tarda, E. ictaluri, Nocardia seriolae, Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, white spot syndrome virus and infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus have been reported. In this review, the application of LAMP for the detection of aquaculture-associated pathogens is discussed.",

The threat of newly emerging pathogens is also a concern for aquaculturists. The rapid diagnosis and prevention of diseases of fish and shellfish in culture systems is important in fish husbandry. Efficient management of disease usually begins by preventing the spread of disease. Disease diagnosis has been mainly based on clinical signs supported by isolation and identification of the aetiological agent. This requires a rapid and sensitive method to detect pathogens. On-farm laboratories are not usually equipped with diagnostic equipment, thus small-scale aquaculture operations depend on specialist fish disease laboratories for their diagnostic needs. However, laboratories routinely handling diagnostic cases are often very busy and take time to carry out diagnoses. In order for laboratories to handle large number of samples sensitive and rapid diagnostic kits are needed.",

This method amplifies target DNA from a few copies to 10 9 copies in less than an hour under isothermal conditions. It is an offshoot of the basic strand displacement techniques which have been described thoroughly (Notomi et al. 2000) . Briefly, four highly specific primers are constructed from the target DNA, one set of primers anneal to the target region one after the other on the same strand and the primer which anneals at the later stage displaces the strand formed by the first primer with the help of Bst DNA polymerase. The Bst polymerase has a strand displacement activity. This takes place on both strands and the primers are designed such that loops are formed. The reaction is carried out under isothermal conditions as denaturation of the strand takes place by strand displacement. The reactions produce a series of stem-loop DNAs with various lengths. The four primers hybridize against six distinct sequences in the target DNA making it highly specific.",

The technical specifications of each primer and the optimized annealing temperatures are described in detail by Notomi et al. (2000) . The primers can be developed using Primer Explorer version 3 software (http://primerexplorer.jp/lamp 3.0.0/) specifically designed to develop LAMP primers. By using additional sets of loop primers, the reaction time of LAMP can be further accelerated (Nagamine, Hase & Notomi 2002) . Using loop primers the time required is reduced by half, making it a more efficient tool in disease diagnostic applications.",

The reaction proceeds at isothermal conditions for 1 h or less depending on the efficiency of the developed primers and template DNA. The template DNA for LAMP is denatured for 5 min at 95\u00b0C before setting up the LAMP reaction for isothermal amplification (Notomi et al. 2000) . However, studies have shown that non-denatured templates can also be used directly for LAMP-mediated detection (Nagamine, Watanabe, Ohtsuka, Hase & Notomi 2001) . The LAMP reaction is carried out at 60-65\u00b0C for 45-60 min and the reaction terminated at 80\u00b0C for 2 min (Fig. 1 ). The main advantage of the technique is that it does not need thermocyclers.

            "text": "Several methods may be used to check for the LAMP reaction. The products are commonly visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis stained with an intercalating agent such as ethidium bromide or SYBR Green I. As the LAMP reaction produces products of various lengths of stem loop structures, the gel will show products from the minimum length of target DNA to the loading well, which appears as a smear and bands at the base of the gel. Because amplification of the target DNA is so high at the final stage it is vulnerable to contamination in subsequent amplifications. However, an advantage of the large amount of product that is generated is that it can be visualized on a UV-transilluminator by incorporating intercalating agents directly into the LAMP-amplified tubes (Notomi et al. 2000) . Another method is by assessing the amount of white precipitate formed from magnesium pyrophosphate (Mori, Nagamine, Tomita & Notomi 2001 ). The DNA formed by amplification of prostate-specific antigen by PCR for 35 cycles and LAMP for 60 min at 65\u00b0C was 0.2 and 11.2 lg 25 lL )1 , respectively (Mori et al. 2001) . The huge amount of DNA formed by LAMP allows the detection of turbidity using a desktop centrifuge, as the precipitate accumulates at the bottom of the tube. Negative reactions neither show smearing nor turbidity in the reaction mixture.",

            "text": "There are several published reports regarding the use of LAMP for the detection of bacterial isolates from humans, fish and the aquatic environment. The first report of the application of LAMP to detect bacterial isolates was by Maruyama, Kenzaka, Yamaguchi, Tani & Nasu (2003) . These authors developed a novel strategy using LAMP to detect Escherichia coli from the coastal environment, where the stx gene was detected by an in situ method. Several reports on LAMP-mediated diagnostic methods have been developed for bacterial pathogens associated with fish. The first use of LAMP for detection of an aquaculture pathogen was reported for edwardsiellosis (Savan, Igarashi, Matsuoka & Sakai 2004) . Edwardsiella tarda was detected from infected Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus. LAMP primers were designed by targeting the haemolysin gene (Fig. 2) . The specificity of LAMP was tested for five different E. tarda strains isolated from eel (E22), tilapia (E 381), flatfish (FPC 498), water from eel culture ponds (SU226) and sea bream (158). Non-specific amplification was not seen in other enteric bacteria and those which produce enterotoxins. The optimum amplification regime for a clear visible banding pattern was at 65\u00b0C for 45 min. Edwardsiella tarda could be Figure 1 Schematic representation of the procedure used in detecting pathogens by loop-mediated isothermal amplification. The reaction mixture and template is amplified at isothermal temperature and can be detected by staining the agarose gel or by incorporating the intercalating agents in the reaction tube and visualizing. detected from 10 and 10 3 CFU by LAMP and PCR, respectively. Thus, in this case, LAMP-based detection was much more sensitive than PCR. Furthermore, LAMP could detect the pathogen from Japanese flounder pond water with an E. tarda count of 3.8 \u00b7 10 2 CFU. A LAMP-based diagnostic system has been recently developed for detection of E. ictaluri from diseased catfish, Ictalurus punctatus (Yeh, Shoemaker & Klesius 2005) . The LAMP primers were designed targeting the eip18 gene. The LAMP reaction amplified six different strains of E. ictaluri. Non-specific amplification was not observed when tested with 12 other bacterial strains associated with channel catfish. The detection limit by LAMP was 20 CFU, more sensitive than real-time PCR and traditional biochemical assays (Bilodeau, Waldbieser, Terhune, Wise & Wolters 2003) . Edwardsiella ictaluri could be detected using genomic DNA from infected brain samples as template. The LAMP method has also been applied to the detection of nocardiosis (Kawakami, Kono & Sakai 2005) . Nocardiosis is a serious pathogen affecting yellowtail, Seriola quinqueradiata, and amberjack, S. aureovittata. Nocardial diagnosis has been mainly achieved by isolation and biochemical identification. Recently, PCR detection has been possible for nocardiosis (Kono, Ooyama, Chen & Sakai 2001; Miyoshi & Suzuki 2002) . In these studies, the detection limits by LAMP and PCR were 10 3 and 10 4 CFU, respectively. Compared with PCR a 10-fold higher sensitivity is seen using LAMP. Furthermore, LAMP detection was superior to PCR when spleen DNA extracted from infected fish was used as template.",

The detection limit of the viral DNA template was at the 10 fg level, whereas nested PCR-mediated detection was limited to the 100 fg level. Detection by LAMP was superior to PCR in that it was faster and more sensitive. LAMP-mediated detection for koi herpes virus (KHV) by targeting the thymidine kinase (tk) gene (AJ535112) has been developed. The detection limit was found to be similar to PCR primers targeting the tk gene from infected common carp, Cyprinus carpio (Gunimaladevi, Kono, Venugopal & Sakai 2004) . Screening for KHV has become very important as trade of fancy carp is an easy route for geographical spread of the virus and a rapid and efficient system like LAMP is very Figure 2 Loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction amplifying the haemolysin gene from Edwardsiella tarda isolates. The samples denoted as positive are E. tarda isolates. Amplification was not seen in the control (-), the no template reaction (NT) and from the non-specific DNA template. The products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. suitable for this purpose. LAMP has also been used to detect red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) (Caipang, Haraguchi, Ohira, Hirono & Aoki 2004) . The RSIV DNA was amplified using DNA extracts obtained from spleen of infected red sea bream, Pagrus major. The protocol developed is 10 times more sensitive than conventional PCR for detecting RSIV. The authors also showed a correlation between the number of DNA copies of the virus and the corresponding turbidity, which can be used to quantify virus particles in infected fish.",

However, LAMP was superior to conventional PCR assay (Poon et al. 2004) . In fish, RT-LAMP has been reported for infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) (Gunimaladevi, Kono, Lapatra & Sakai 2005) . This virus affects wild and hatchery-reared salmonids causing widespread mortality. Several immunological and molecular methods to detect IHNV have been developed and RT-PCR and real-time PCR are commonly used for IHNV diagnosis. An RT-LAMP protocol for detection of IHNV was developed targeting the G-protein of the virus. A comparative analysis of RT-LAMP, LAMP and nested PCR was conducted. LAMP and nested PCR require an additional 30-40 min as cDNA must be synthesized first. However, RT-LAMP can directly use RNA as template, where the cDNA synthesis and target gene amplification is carried out in a single tube. In this study, LAMP was 10-fold more sensitive than nested PCR. Although real-time PCR is a superior method, RT-LAMP might be a good alternative as the former can be expensive as a routine diagnostic tool.",

Amplification and detection should therefore be carried out in separate working areas. As positive reactions are seen as a smear, together with some bands of low molecular weight, and are not seen as a single band as in PCR, the specificity of amplification should be thoroughly validated to ensure that the primers only amplify the target sequence of the specific pathogen. Alternatively, the specificity can be determined by cutting the amplified products using restriction enzymes specific to the target sequence. Detection of two or more pathogens in a single reaction, as in multiplex PCR or nested PCR, is not possible using LAMP.",

            "text": "Diagnosis of bacterial infections can be cumbersome because isolation and identification takes time and resources. Bacterial infection with mixed aetiology makes the diagnosis even more complex. Farm managers, together with their previous experience of the clinical signs of diseased fish, rely on diagnostic kits available in the market to detect bacterial agents. The available diagnostic kits are easy to use, do not require expensive equipment but take 12-24 h to obtain a result. PCR-mediated detection has been developed for several diseases in aquaculture caused by bacterial or viral agents. The LAMP-mediated diagnosis of edwardselliosis, WSSV, RSIV, IHNV and KHV clearly demonstrates the usefulness of the method as a diagnostic tool. The diagnosis can be based on specific DNA markers as target region for the bacteria. LAMP can also be used for the detection of bacterial resistance to antibiotics by targeting antimicrobial resistance genes. Using LAMP less time is required for detection, allowing more time to use management practices to minimize the spread of disease. Viral diseases in fish and shellfish can cause mass mortalities and the use of specific pathogen-free stocks is an excellent way to prevent the introduction of disease-causing agents into culture systems. A major problem lies in the introduction of carriers from imported fish stocks, e.g. introduction of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus/IHNV infected fish into Japan (Yamazaki 1974) . Along with robust legislation, a reliable and sensitive diagnostic technique is needed to detect known and emerging pathogens. The development of diagnostic kits based on nucleic acid detection is simpler and more cost-effective than developing virus specific celllines.",

However, cross-reaction with host tissues because of the presence of complementing conserved rDNA sequences has been suggested as a cause of false-positive results (Perkins & Martin 1999) . Using LAMP the specificity could be enhanced as the primers hybridize to six distinct sequences (El-Matbouli & Soliman 2005) .",

The presence of huge amounts of target DNA facilitates detection using a nucleic acid probe.Song, Toma, Nakasone & Iwanaga (2005) developed a LAMP assay for Shigella and enteroinvasive E. coli by targeting the ipaH gene, with amplification within 2 h starting with as few as 8 CFU. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causing Johne's disease, a chronic progressive enteritis in ruminants, has a wide host range. LAMP primer sets were developed to detect the MAP IS900 fragment and were specific for MAP. Furthermore, the detection was simplified as the turbidity of the reaction allowed visual detection(Enosawa, Kageyama, Sawai, Watanabe, Notomi, Onoe, Mori & Yokomizo 2003).Iwamoto, Sonobe & Hayashi (2003) also developed an accurate detection assay for the M. tuberculosis complex, M. avium and M. intracellulare from sputum samples using LAMP. Detection of Legionella(Annaka 2003) and the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis(Maeda, Kokeguchi, Fujimoto, Tanimoto, Yoshizumi, Nishimura & Takashiba 2005) by LAMP was developed by targeting the 16sRNA gene.",
