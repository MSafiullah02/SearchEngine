In ferrets, several causes of vestibular diseases have been described, including toxins, infectious diseases (e.g., canine distemper virus, Aleutian disease, rabies, toxoplasmosis, and ferret systemic coronavirus), neoplasia (e.g., choroid plexus papilloma and granular cell tumor), trauma, and systemic disease (e.g., hypoglycemia).1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Causes of vestibular disease in dogs and cats include neoplasia, trauma, toxin exposure, infectious disease, inflammatory disease, vascular disease, nutritional disorders, idiopathic disease, and congenital disorders.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 For congenital causes, a hereditary origin is assumed as some breeds appear to be predisposed to vestibular disease. Nonetheless, pathogenesis of the disease is not well known. Onset of vestibular clinical signs in these animals can vary, ranging from birth to several weeks of age, with both unilateral or bilateral deafness being present.11, 16\n",

Central vestibular disease results from lesions to the vestibular nuclei in the medulla or the vestibular projections to the cerebellum (cerebellar nuclei). Both peripheral and central vestibular disease can usually be distinguished by the presence of specific neurologic signs and diagnostic testing.7, 8, 9 Common clinical disease signs of vestibular disease include ataxia, head tilt, nystagmus, and strabismus. Lesions affecting the central vestibular system typically produce clinical signs suggesting involvement of the medulla, including altered mentation, ipsilateral proprioceptive deficits, vertical nystagmus, and involvement of multiple cranial nerves. The anatomic diagnosis of peripheral vestibular disease is made in the absence of clinical disease signs associated with the medulla.10\n",

These abnormalities result in a tendency for the animal to fall or roll toward the side of the lesion. However, animals with peripheral vestibular disease have no loss of general proprioception, which is assessed by performing postural reaction tests. Owing to impaired balance, postural reaction tests can be difficult to perform in affected animals. Ferrets with cochlear agenesia or hypoplasia show various degrees of imbalance associated with vestibular syndrome. In addition to this, these animals generally have poor muscle development, aggravating the inability to correctly stand.17\n",

However, complementary tests are needed to rule out other common causes of vestibular ataxia, such as otitis media/interna.12 MRI is the diagnostic imaging modality of choice for the central nervous system, as it allows the clinician to evaluate soft tissue, especially those surrounded by bone. Specific additional MRI sequences can be useful to detect hemorrhage (gradient echo sequences), ischemic disease (diffusion weighted imaging), peri-lesional edema and the presence of pure fluid (fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences), and muscle, bone and nerve root abnormalities (short TI inversion recovery). Computed tomographic imaging provides excellent images of bony structures and is indicated where osseous changes are of greatest diagnostic importance. Computed tomography and MRI are complementary imaging studies of the middle ear, labyrinth, internal auditory canal, and their contents, but MRI is superior in imaging soft tissue components including intralabyrinthine fluid.19, 20, 21, 22, 23 In this case, only one of the tests was available for economic reasons, and MRI was considered the imaging test of choice for better evaluation of the central nervous system and tympanic bullae.",

            "text": "Peripheral deafness is due to disorders of the peripheral auditory organ (middle/inner ear and cochlea). Peripheral deafness can be classified as sensorineural or conductive. Conductive deafness results when sound is blocked from reaching the internal ear because of outer or middle ear pathologies. Sensorineural deafness occurs when there is damage to the hair cells or afferent neurons of the cochlea.16 In dogs and cats, pigment-associated deafness is both the most common type of deafness and form of congenital deafness.16, 24 The white, deaf phenotype has been reported in multiple species, including the ferret, cat, dog, mouse, mink, horse, rat, Syrian hamster, alpaca, and human.16 A hereditary basis is described, and the genes responsible for white or lightened pigmentation in skin and hair suppress melanocyte function. Suppression of melanocytes in the stria vascularis disrupts their regulation of the endolymph composition, and deafness ensues as a secondary effect.16, 25 Vestibular disease is not a finding in these animals. In ferrets, the pigment-associated hereditary defect has been described as Waardenburg syndrome.26 Albino ferrets usually retain hearing for the very high frequencies, which may be of limited practical benefit. These animals demonstrate an abnormally small hearing mechanism in the middle and inner ear.27\n",
