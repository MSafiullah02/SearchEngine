Most previous molecular epidemiological and divergence studies of HRSV have focused on analyses of nucleotide and/or amino acid changes in part of the G protein, which is a type II glycoprotein that mediates attachment of the virus to the cell during virus entry, and is one of the targets of the immune response (Agoti et al., 2010, Cui et al., 2013, Baek et al., 2012, Tan et al., 2013, Murata and Catherman, 2012). These studies have yielded significant volumes of partial genomic information for HRSV and primary analyses based on variation in the G protein.",

More recently, a similar duplication was reported in HRSV-A (ON1) isolates from Canada, Germany, Malaysia, Thailand, Kenya, and South Korea, which was characterized as a 72-nt duplication in the C-terminal third of the G gene (Munywoki et al., 2013, Auksornkitti et al., 2013, Eshaghi et al., 2012, Lee et al., 2012, Prifert et al., 2013). The exact mechanism that allows such duplications to play roles during selective pressure and the factors that may increase their fitness to substitute the BA genotype or other HRSV-B viruses remain to be defined. Similarly, the basis of the evolutionary advantage and antigenic dominance of the HRSV-A (ON1) strain due to the introduction of 72 identical bases in the G gene also needs to be clarified.",

The 717 nt length fragments of G gene from 181 nt position to stop codon based on A2 strain were used for further analysis. To minimize potential biases in the alignment and to obtain a more tractable representation of the dataset, identical sequences were removed using CD-HIT before performing the alignments (Huang et al., 2010). After clustering sequences with an amino acid sequence similarity of >0.98 into one cluster, one sequence was selected from each cluster and the sequences with no identical sequence were also removed. The final representative dataset comprised 18 sequences, which were submitted to GenBank and assigned accession numbers of AB860223\u2013AB860240. To obtain a comprehensive representation of the diverse HRSV-A subgroup, we downloaded 15 publicly available HRSV sequences: WUE/14576/12 (JX912357), NG-016-04 (AB470478), RSV A2 (M74568), Chiba-C/24031 (AB698559), ON138-0111A (JN257694), MO48 (AF233914), SEL/02/98072 (AF193325), CN2395 (AF233905), CH09 (AF065254), NG-009-02 (AB175815), NY20 (AF233918), MO02 (AF233910), NG-082-05 (AB470479), SA98V603 (AF348807), and WUE/16397/12 (JX912364) (Prifert et al., 2013).

The phylogenetic trees were constructed using MUSCLE and MEGA5 (Tamura et al., 2011). The maximum composite likelihood for nucleotide sequences and the JTT model for amino acid sequences were used with the neighbor-joining (NJ) methods to perform the distance calculations.

The dataset was analyzed with an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed uncorrelated clock using the general time-reversible substitution model selected by jModelTest version 2.0 (Posada, 2008). The MCMC chain was run for 200 million steps to achieve convergence, with sampling every 10,000 steps. Convergence was assessed based on the effective sample size (ESS) after a 10% burn-in using Tracer version 1.5 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer) and only parameters where ESS > 200 were accepted. The uncertainties of the estimates were indicated by the 95% highest posterior density intervals.

Thus, extensive genotype and sequence analyses were performed using the HRSV-A subgroup to further study the prevalence of ON1 genotype strains. In total, we investigated 426 HRSV-A samples obtained during 2010\u20132013, where we analyzed the G gene sequences to determine whether a 72-nt duplication was present or absent. According to the broad sequence analysis, the first ON1 genotype strains were discovered in August 2011. In the season from May 2011 to April 2012, 29 samples (17.4%) had the ON1 genotype in South Korea among 167 HRSV-A samples tested. The major genotype in that season was NA1 (133 samples, 79.6%) and the GA5 genotype was also identified (five samples, 3.0%). These genotype distributions were similar to the results reported by the Canadian group (Eshaghi et al., 2012). In the next season (2012\u20132013), however, the prevalence of the ON1 genotypes increased significantly to 94.6% (244/258 HRSV-A-positive samples) and the GA5 genotype was not detected (Table 2 and Fig. 1C). NA1 genotype strains were still detected but only at a very low frequency (14 samples, 5.4%). Our analysis of this newly emerged strain showed that the rapid replacement of the non-ON1 genotypes without a 72-nt duplication in the G gene by the ON1 genotype was dramatic compared with the earlier spread of the HRSV BA genotype.",

A clustering approach was applied (as described in the Materials and Methods section) to remove any redundant sequences and to make the data clear and manageable, while ensuring that the data still represented the diversity of HRSV. The numbers of sequences that belonged to the same clusters (amino acid sequence similarity >0.98) were plotted next to the phylogenetic tree. Finally, 18 isolates and 15 reference sequences were analyzed and the clusters in the phylogenetic tree generated four major groups: ON1, NA1, GA5, and others, including the reference sequences. The phylogenies based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequences (Fig. 2\nA and B) were in almost complete agreement based on the topology of the phylogeny. The branching patterns differed slightly between groups, but the clade compositions were stable within the groups.",

The dN/dS (nonsynonymous to synonymous codon changes per site) ratio averaged over all sites ranged from 0.669 to 1.185 with different codon substitution models. Models M2 and M8, which allowed for positive selection, fitted our dataset better than the two neutral models (M1 and M7).

The relative genetic diversity has increased around 2006 in population size. Following that period, a limited fluctuation was observed in 2010 with a subsequent dramatic increase in the effective virus population size after 2011. The specific selective pressure applied to the virus in 2006 remains to be clarified, but this increasing trend in the relative genetic diversity of HRSV was followed by the initial appearance of the HRSV-A ON1 strain. In this analysis, we could also assume that ON1 genotype was emerged in 2009 year, although first ON1 case was discovered in 2011.

This ON1_OS strain was isolated from eight patients who were enrolled between October 2012 and January 2013 in five cities in South Korea (Fig. 1C). This finding suggests the replication and spread of these strains. The change of a 25 amino acid region into a novel sequence at the C-terminal is quite long and we still do not know the structure of G protein, so it might be possible that structural transformations occurred because of the 72-nt duplication or other variations.

A similar prevalence pattern was also observed in the present study. For example, HRSV-A did not lead the infections of patients with acute respiratory illness during the 2010\u20132011 season, but HRSV-A was prevalent in the following season of 2011\u20132012, which might be related to the emergence of the novel HRSV-A genotype in the human population. HRSV-A remained prevalent in the following season of 2012\u20132013, but we found that the prevalent subgroup of the 2013\u20132014 season is HRSV-B in South Korea (data not shown).",

Variation and the positive selection for amino acid changes are focused in two hypervariable regions, and the C-terminal third of the G protein contains multiple epitopes (Melero et al., 1997). Immune escape by new variants may contribute to the diversity and prevalence of HRSV. Combinations of novel substitutions and flip-flop changes in amino acids are involved with various epitope transitions, which reflect the immune status of the human population. Our epitope prediction analysis suggested the presence of a new epitope in the GG818/12 strain, where a 1-nt deletion occurred after the 72-nt duplication. We also found that several positively selected sites, i.e., amino acids 237, 274, and 280, were located in common epitopes with a high probability, which also supported our hypothesis. Furthermore, it was known that protective immunity through neutralizing antibody which was important for host defense against HRSV is of short duration (Sande et al., 2013). Immunological evidence is also required to clarify this phenomenon, but periodic substitutions of the prevalent HRSV-A and -B subgroups, as well as variations in the G protein and short-lived immunity, might be accompanied by changes in the herd immune status of human populations with respect to specific genotypes (Collins and Graham, 2008).",

Whereas, our data which were encompassed HRSV-A G genes collected in 2013 strongly indicate that the relative genetic diversity patterns of the HRSV-A G genes were significantly correlated with the emergence and prevalence of the HRSV-A ON1 genotype, which was rapidly emerged and maintained as a predominant strain.",

It remains to be clarified whether changes in the antigenicity of the G protein and/or substantial changes in the herd immune status have contributed to the rapid dominance of HRSV-A ON1. Furthermore it will also be crucial to understand determining factor(s) of viral phenotype, fitness of the HRSV-ON1 and its variant such as HRSV-ON1_OS subgenotype or transmission/complete replacement like BA genotype of HRSV-B. Although we conferred emergence of the strain into South Korea might be mediated by overseas transmission through limited genetic analysis (data not shown), cumulative evolutionary information with time scale is still required to verify global spread of the ON1 genotype precisely, Therefore, meticulous and continuous monitoring of the evolutionary trends in the G gene is essential to obtain insights that may facilitate vaccine development and amendment of public health responses against HRSV infection.",
