Bordering the sacral hiatus laterally are the sacral cornu, which are bony prominences representing remnants of the inferior articular processes of the fifth sacral vertebra.24 The sacral cornu are easily palpated in infants and younger children.

Severe local anesthetic toxicity occurred in 0.76 of 10,000 patients, which is lower than reported adult data.

Thus, early signs of toxicity may include CNS signs, such as circumoral numbness, lightheadedness, dizziness, tinnitus, restlessness, and slurred speech. Increasing levels produce tonic-clonic seizures and eventual coma. As plasma levels further increase, cardiovascular signs develop. Short-acting local anesthetics like lidocaine tend to cause bradycardia and hypotension from vasodilation and myocardial depression. Cardiac arrest later ensues. Long-acting local anesthetics like bupivacaine and ropivacaine, however, may lead to ventricular arrythmias, peaked T waves, or complete cardiovascular collapse.

In the anesthetized pediatric patient, early signs of intravascular injection from a test dose can be EKG changes, such as peaked T waves or increased blood pressure.35 Sensitivity and specificity of test dosing in pediatric patients under anesthesia, however, have not been conclusive and do not provide early warning signs of rapid local anesthetic intravascular absorption.34 Pediatric patients at highest risk for severe LAST seem to be infants less than 6 month old, with all incidences associated with bolus dosing.22 Some investigators advocate a 30% reduction in local anesthetic dosing in this population.33\n",

Controlled hypotension has been shown to decrease blood loss, although increases the risk of poor end-organ perfusion, including the spinal cord. Hemodilution techniques involve removing and storing patient\u2019s blood and replacing it with crystalloid/colloid prior to start of surgery. Fewer red cells are lost during surgical blood loss, and patient\u2019s own blood can be transfused intraoperatively when needed. Antifibrinolytic agents, such as epsilon-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid inhibit the degradation of fibrin. Their use have been shown to decrease intraoperative blood loss as well. Of these techniques, intraoperative blood salvage and antifibrinolytic agents are the most widely used.57\n,\n58\n",

Preoperative concerns include children\u2019s psychological development, heightened anxiety, and frequent predilection to respiratory infections. Pain management is an essential part of perioperative care and often involves a multimodal approach. The goal of minimizing opioid use is especially important given the concerns of unexpected metabolism of oral opioids. Regional anesthetic in the form of neuraxial or peripheral nerve blocks are valuable to combat perioperative pain. The safety in performing these blocks in the anesthetized pediatric patient has been confirmed in recent studies. Certain pediatric orthopedic surgeries can have unique anesthetic concerns. Understanding these concerns is necessary for optimal anesthetic care and outcomes.",
