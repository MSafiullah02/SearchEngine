            "text": "Infections in patients after chemotherapy remain a relevant risk, despite modern anti-infective treatment [1]. Childhood leukemia is regarded a principally \u201ccurable disease\u201d these days, cure rates exceeding 80% in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) underline the importance to avoid deaths due to side effects [27]. The incidence of infections in oncology patients is 14\u201360%, and up to 10% of the patients die in the context of the infections [2, 3]. Several risk factors for infections are well known, such as the duration of neutropenia, co-medication with steroids, parenteral nutrition and central venous lines [4\u20136]. Besides, genetic factors influence the susceptibility to infection: Several studies showed (conflicting) results with regard to the role of cytokine production and the outcome of patients during sepsis. Hence, genetic polymorphisms might influence the course of infections in critically ill patients [7\u20139]. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alfa (LT-\u03b1) function as mediators of immune regulation and inflammation. Both lymphokines have similar biologic activities, and show 35% identity and 50% homology in amino acid sequence [10, 11]. The genes coding for TNF and LT-\u03b1 are located tandemly on the chromosomal region 6p21.3-21.1 and are closely linked to the HLA-B locus within a highly polymorphic region of the major histocompatibility complex. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms of the TNF gene have been described. Exchange of guanine by adenine at position \u2212308 of the TNF promoter region (TNF2 allele) is associated with higher serum levels of soluble TNF [12]. The TNF \u2212308 (G \u2192 A) polymorphism has been associated with susceptibility to cerebral malaria, lepromatous leprosy, mucocutaneous leishmaniosis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, fatal meningococcal disease, and septic shock [13\u201316]. A polymorphism in the coding region at position +252 of the LT-\u03b1 gene (A \u2192 G) leads to different alleles of LT-\u03b1, here referred to as LT-\u03b1 (10.5 kb) for the wild-type allele, and LT-\u03b1 (5.5 kb) for the variant allele. The LT-\u03b1 (5.5 kb) allele was associated with higher levels of soluble LT-\u03b1 in patients homozygous for LT-\u03b1 (5.5 kb) [17]. A strong association between the LT-\u03b1 (5.5 kb) allele and adverse outcome in autoimmune diseases (e.g. Crohn\u2019s disease) has been described. Biologic actions of both cytokines as well as their association with autoimmune and severe inflammatory disorders have drawn interest to their potential role in the prognosis of infections.",

However, during bacterial infections or even sepsis, an excessive or untimely TNF-\u03b1 production proved to be extremely disadvantageous for patients and resulted in enhanced mortality and morbidity [18, 19].",

Third, no TNF-\u03b1 levels were measured in the study population, hence the conclusion whether or not the genetic profile resulted in significantly different TNF serum levels cannot be answered from our data. With regard to this aspect, however, several studies have unveiled that \u201chigh-producer\u201d polymorphisms such as the LT-\u03b1 allele (5.5 kb) and the TNF2 allele are strongly related to high elevated TNF levels in vivo [17, 19].",
