To contain the diffusion of COVID-19 virus, Governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population. One important consequence of quarantine is a change in lifestyle: reduced physical activity and unhealthy diet. 2019 guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease indicate that \"Adults should engage in at least 150 minute per week of accumulated moderate-intensity or 75 minute per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity) to reduce ASCVD risk.\" During quarantine, strategies to further increase home-based physical activity and to follow a healthy diet should be implemented. Quarantine carries some longterm effects on cardiovascular disease, mainly related to unhealthy lifestyle and anxiety. Following quarantine a global action supporting healthy diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage people to return to good lifestyle.",

In public health practice, \"quarantine\" refers to the separation of persons (or communities) who have been exposed to an infectious disease. \"Isolation,\" in contrast, applies to the separation of persons who are known to be infected [1] . There are several examples of Government imposed quarantine or travel bans, i.e., at least 18 US states quarantined people returning from West Africa during the 2014 Ebola outbreak [1] . Now, COVID-19 infection is causing a global pandemic with a high number of deaths. By March 29, Italy reported 10,023 deaths (Italian Health Ministry, https://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocorona virus/) [2] . To contain the diffusion of the COVID-19 virus, the Italian Government as well as others have enforced on the population. The previous experience of the SARS outbreak showed the efficacy of timely quarantine and isolation measures [3, 4] . Quarantine is often an unpleasant experience: loss of freedom, uncertainty over disease status, and boredom can create dramatic effects. The potential benefits of mandatory mass quarantine need to be weighed carefully against the possible long-term negative effects on cardiovascular risk burden [4, 5] .",

            "text": "The main consequence of quarantine is a change in lifestyle and nutritional habits (Table 1) . Nutritional habits will change due to reduced availability of goods, limited access to food caused by restricted store opening hours, and to a switch to unhealthy food. A recent review on the psychological impact of quarantine [6] reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Having inadequate basic supplies (e.g., food, water) during quarantine was a source of frustration [7] and continued to be associated with anxiety and anger for 4-6 months following release [7, 8] . Due to anxiety of future food shortage, it is plausible that people will purchase packaged and long-life food rather than fresh food. This leads to weight gain and to a reduced intake of antioxidants. Oxidative stress and mild chronic vascular inflammation are part of the pathophysiology of hypertension and atherosclerosis [9] . Diets rich in antioxidant food (i.e., Mediterranean diet and Dash diet) are vascular protective. Several studies found that the Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduction in incidence, prevalence, and mortality from coronary artery disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and in all-causes mortality including cancer [10, 11] . A systematic review on 7186 subjects (5168 subjects assigned to a Mediterranean diet), reported a significant reduction in central obesity with a Mediterraneantype diet [12] . Mediterranean diet is naturally low in sodium due to its low degree of processing, unlike processed foods (a term that covers all foods that have undergone manufacturing methods, including convenience foods and products like bread, cheese, and meat products) and is also rich in fruit and vegetables [13] . Diets rich in fruits and vegetables have several positive effects: known health benefits of high flavonol intake, potential increase in nitric oxide species, concomitant weight loss, reduction of blood pressure, and reduction of inflammatory markers [14, 15] . These beneficial effects are similar in men and women despite the fact that adherence to diet and healthy lifestyle is influenced by gender [11, 16] . Quarantine induces anxiety and stress. Torres and Nowson analyzed the relationship between stress and eating behavior and identified that people cope with stress by eating and drinking in an attempt to feel better (\"stressrelated eating\"). These stress-driven eaters and drinkers were more likely to eat unhealthy foods such as snacks, hamburgers, soda cola, and chocolate regularly and to drink wine and spirits more frequently. In addition, the lack of emotional support from friends and relatives was predictive of stress-driven eating and drinking behaviors [17, 18] . During quarantine, stress-driven eaters would easily switch from a healthy diet to unhealthy ones. This would affect cardiovascular risk mainly in high-risk patients.",

Oxidative stress is mutually linked to inflammation, often associated with an increased risk of endothelial dysfunction [21] . In addition, obesity is associated with elevated circulating levels of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1, which are subsequently decreased with weight loss.

It remains unclear whether positive well-being leads to better subsequent health behaviors or vice versa, however a strong relationship has been demonstrated. Positive well-being is thought to have multiple salutary effects during stress, such as reducing inflammatory and cardiovascular responses to acute stressors. Positive well-being also acts on cardiovascular function and cardiac autonomic control, reducing heart rate and blood pressure [24, 26] .",

In this case the risk of an economic crisis will maintain stress and anxiety in subjects, principally in those belonging to low socio-economic categories, leading to an increase in cardiovascular risk. Following the Spagnola pandemic throughout 1918, a peak of cardiovascular events was reported. Such events manifest from 7 to 10 days after the emergence of influenza symptoms. In 1918, immediately after the end of the Spagnola epidemic, deaths caused by cardiovascular events had outmatched deaths from other causes, including superimposed pneumonia [30, 31] .",
