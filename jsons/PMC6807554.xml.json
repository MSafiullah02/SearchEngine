In the general population, pediatric and elderly patients are particularly at risk for these infections and complications. Historically, culture and detection by direct fluorescence antibody staining and ELISA have been the traditional method for diagnosis of respiratory infections. Culture for many organisms is notoriously insensitive due to fastidious growth requirements, and DFAs and ELISA are labor\u2010intensive and insensitive due to low\u2010level infections that fall below the practical sensitivity of these methodologies. DFAs are also subject to technical error and subjective/inconsistent result interpretation. Each of these methodologies has also been shown to be less sensitive than polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2010based detection methods for viral respiratory pathogens 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Additionally, influenza A & B and RSV can be rapidly tested using chromatographic immunoaasays in the ambulatory care setting; however, the influenza assays in particular have displayed unacceptable sensitivities 8, 9. Taken together, these various limitations can lead to a delay in or lack of pathogen identification, as well as inappropriate use of antimicrobial therapy 10.",

Because the LDT LoD for RSV exceeded the value originally established for that assay by greater than 1 log, sequencing of the target region of the test virus was performed to check for polymorphisms potentially affecting PCR efficiency 12. Sequencing revealed two previously undescribed polymorphisms that likely account for this difference. These results are consistent with LDT and FARP having comparably low LoDs for RSV strains not containing these polymorphisms. Two analytes with comparatively high LoD values on the FARP (Adeno and Bpert) were interrogated individually to determine whether the pooling of analytes had any negative effect on the LoD values.

As a result, industry efforts toward developing rapid, sensitive, panel\u2010based molecular diagnostics for respiratory pathogens have been aggressively pursued in recent years, and many are now commercially available 11. One such assay, the LuminexTM xTAG RVP, was shown to be a cost effective option for respiratory pathogen detection and its use resulted in shorter hospital stays overall in Canadian hospitals 13. This technology however is labor\u2010intensive and requires proficiency in molecular techniques as well as a dedicated amplicon room. For laboratories unable to practically adopt a complex multiplex assay, but interested in replacing viral DFA with molecular multiplex testing, the FARP is an attractive alternative. The major advantages to this system are the fully enclosed platform and the overall simplicity of the setup and performance. A separate molecular work area and molecular expertise are not required as a result of these attributes. Several recent studies have compared the FARP head\u2010to\u2010head with other real\u2010time PCR platforms for overall agreement, and one study performed a clinical comparison in real\u2010time for immunocompromised patients; however, this study provides a fully resolved comparison to DFA, the methodology likely to be displaced by FARP in most clinical laboratories adopting this technology 14, 15, 16, 17.",

After resolution of the discrepant subset, many analytes were 100% in concordance with DFA results. The majority of unexpected negatives were resolved as \u201ctrue negatives\u201d by LDT, misinterpreted DFAs, or clerical errors in the freezer database.

There were three unexpected positive analytes detected in the Rhino\u2010positive specimen cohort that are not reflected in the calculations in Tables 2 and 3 since the reference method for these other analytes (DFA) was negative during patient testing. Because the specimens were negative by DFA, they were reflexed to RVP testing; however, the RVP detected Adeno in two samples and 2009 H1N1 in one sample, none of which were detected by FARP.

Though the concentration of some samples fell below the FARP LoD for Adeno, several of the samples were within range of the established LoD, which further suggests that the target nucleic acid sequence was not amplified. In fact, the FARP does not detect all Adeno subtypes (personal communication, Idaho Technology Inc.), a limitation shared by the RVP 19. However, the agreement values for Adeno were consistent with those reported by Idaho Technology Inc. 18. This analyte is troubling in its current performance, and we have adopted an algorithm that includes reflex to Adeno\u2010DFA for all FARP negative specimens to allow for comprehensive detection of this pathogen. This approach would be appropriate for laboratories considering the FARP as a replacement for DFA.

The remaining analytes were greater than 1.5 log less sensitive than the corresponding LDTs, with Adeno, Rhino, and Bpert having LoD values over 2.5 log higher than the LDTs. Though these relative differences in LoD are striking, the assay was able to detect positives consistently in our cohort of clinical specimens with the exception of Adeno. Interestingly, the LoD values for RSV were comparably low for both LDT and FARP for viruses lacking polymorphisms in the targeted nucleic acid. Consistent with this low LoD, the FARP was previously shown to detect RSV samples that the RVP could not detect 16. This comparative LoD analysis has not previously been performed for the FARP, and this information provides adopting laboratories with information on the relative analytical sensitivity of the assay in measured units that are universally applicable in all molecular diagnostics.",

The run capacity of the FARP is approximately one pouch per 70 min; therefore, a significant time and cost investment would be required to individually evaluate all of the available analytes using robust sample sizes. We pooled analytes in order to achieve a high number of positive and negative specimens as well as test the overall capabilities of the multiplexing platform for \u201cmixed infections.\u201d Pooling was shown to have no deleterious effects on the FARPs ability to detect targeted analytes. As well, pooling did not have a negative impact on the assay's LoD for Bpert and Adeno. An inherent limitation of pooling clinical specimens for evaluation purposes is that failure to detect a target analyte may be masked by an unexpected positive of the same analyte from another member of that pool. For instance, if a pool includes FluA, FluB, RSV, Rhino, and hMPV, the FluB may be undetected in the intended patient positive; however, another patient could have an unexpected FluB co\u2010infection (previously undetected) that may be detected. In the final run output, this scenario would not be appreciated, and could skew agreement statistics. Due to our high numbers of discrepant samples, we ran multiple pools individually as single specimens for resolution purposes and only encountered this hypothetical scenario once with a Rhino specimen. Also, PCR inhibitors that may be present in a single specimen may be diluted in a pool, therefore specimens that would normally be missed may amplify, though this scenario was not documented.",

Though it is preferable to utilize patient specimens in order to maintain the appropriate matrix and clinically realistic analyte concentrations, commercially manufactured analytes may also be considered as a pooled specimen in order to achieve an appropriate cohort size. Commercially prepared samples are quality controlled, and as a result there should be little to no discrepant resolution required for the laboratory; an attractive attribute for laboratories that do not have access to individual LDTs. As well, rare analytes or analytes with no readily available reference method can be validated using commercially prepared analytes. We chose to use primary specimens from our pediatric population for this study to simulate the condition in which the assay would be normally operating, as this study also served as a validation of the FARP as a research use only assay (preceding FDA approval). As a result, we could not evaluate nine of the now FDA approved analytes including Coronavirus HKU1, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus OC43, Parainfluenza 4, Influenza A subtypes H1 seasonal and H3, C. pneumonia, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. We also did not have confirmed specimens of Bocavirus (non\u2010FDA approved analyte), so it could not be evaluated, despite having identified this pathogen in several pools. It should also be noted that the pre\u2010market version of this platform provided identifications of \u201cRhinovirus\u201d, however, the FDA approved product reports the analyte as \u201cRhinovirus/Enterovirus.\u201d",

More importantly, this report serves as a resource to laboratories interested in replacing DFA in favor of the FARP by demonstrating the overall performance of the various analytes with primarily clinical specimens, as well as providing justification for pooling analytes in order to balance time, expense, and robustness of sample size.
