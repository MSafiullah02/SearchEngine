            "text": "The range of ethical dilemmas faced by clinicians in the usual care of their patients ranges from everyday ethical challenges to more difficult and serious dilemmas that may require a team approach, such as a clinical ethics consultation. Ethical dilemmas are generally addressed through the use of an analysis of issues and problem-solving process based on the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and social justice. Ethically acceptable options are considered, preferably in conjunction with the patient, the family, and/or a surrogate decision-maker, with the resulting best ethical option agreed upon. This controlled process in a generally supportive environment is not always possible with ethical dilemmas that occur in austere environments, where decisions may be required without the opportunity to contemplate, consult, or discuss with patients or colleagues. In other words, the clinician must make a decision based on the information known at the time, and carry out the decided action in a timely manner under what could be dangerous or chaotic conditions.",

These situations are not part and parcel of the usual medical education and training. While not every potential difficult situation can be predicted, understanding the potential general ethical challenges posed in austere environments before they might occur can better prepare a clinician with ethically permissible courses of action as a foundation. The following sections will develop the concepts of ethical challenges in civilian disasters and military combat and the importance of thoughtful preparation.",

            "text": "While treating victims of terroristic attacks can be quite challenging, how does a physician approach the care of the perpetrators? Are there limits to the ethical treatment of humans who allegedly have committed such violence? In their thought-provoking article, Gesundheit et al. related the difficult feelings these Israeli physicians felt when treating Hamas fighters who had been captured in acts of violence and terrorism. They asked, among other questions, \u201cShould hospitals expend limited public health care resources on a terrorist, thereby perhaps depriving other patients of medical care?\u201d (Gesundheit et al. 2009a). From a legal perspective, Gesundheit and other responders to this article point out that terrorist suspects are not covered under the \u201cGeneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War\u201d definition of \u201clawful combatants\u201d. Their activity should therefore be treated as illegal acts of civilians. The Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War states that the wounded, whether \u201cmembers of armed forces who have laid down their arms\u201d or \u201cthose placed out of action by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause,\u201d should still be treated \u201chumanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, color, religion, or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria\u201d. \u201cTheir (the suspected terrorist\u2019s) use of illegal war methods does not justify violations of those rules by the other side\u2026 Terrorism is no different than any other willful acts committed during war and does not justify an exception to the physician\u2019s obligation to treat\u201d (Geneva Convention (IV) 1949; Davis 2009; Marks 2009; Lepora et al. 2009).",

            "text": "But where does a physician\u2019s commitment to the ethical principle of social justice fit into this scenario of caring for a suspected terrorist? Physicians do have an ethical responsibility to promote justice in care, but that responsibility is to social justice and not punitive justice (Brassington 2009). When a patient who is suspected of terroristic, or any other illegal activity, is under a physician\u2019s emergency care, they must be treated as though they were only allegedly guilty and not as though they were convicted. Social justice should protect against discrimination on non-medical grounds (including suspected terrorist activity, or which ideology the patient follows) (Davis 2009). It is the ethical responsibility of the physician and the healthcare team to care for those when and where they can, even if the suspected terrorists have just committed atrocities aimed at the physician\u2019s community. There will likely be emotional conflicts within the health care team, but as Gesunheit and colleagues described, it is possible to control those conflicts under the guidelines of a physician\u2019s ethical responsibility. From both a legal and ethical perspective, there is a responsibility to treat terroristic suspects only according to their injury acuity, regardless of the emotional conflicts (Gesundheit et al. 2009b). However, it may be \u201ceasier stated, than done.\u201d",

This premise is based on the social worth that a physician can provide to society over the course of a practice lifetime (Gesundheit et al. 2009b). However, this instinct of self-protection should be carefully weighed and considered by each physician so as to avoid abandoning professional responsibilities to patients in the name of self-preservation. Personal protective equipment and treatment should be available to first responders and subsequent care providers who will be treating the injured to ensure that they are able to continue caring for patients. Triage, therefore, is considered a nuanced combination of medical/surgical priorities and the preservation of first responder and physician capabilities over the course of the treatment period.",

            "text": "Physicians who provide medical and surgical care as members of any nation\u2019s Armed Forces face the task of preparing to practice in multiple settings, often austere and extreme. Outside of combat, these settings and issues are, for the most part, similar to civilian practice. In the extreme environment of combat, circumstances may arise that create tension on the sworn responsibilities of physician and officer. Military physicians serve two primary roles\u2014physician and officer. As physicians, their role is to engage in the care of patients according to established ethical guidelines. As military officers, their role is to \u201csupport and defend the constitution against all enemies\u201d. Much is made of the \u201cdual agency\u201d of the military medical officer with respect to duties and responsibilities to the patient as well as the military unit. It is worth noting that this \u201cdual agency\u201d is not unique to the military. Physicians working as employees will have contractual obligations and limitations that range from fairly benign (e.g., restricting prescribing medications that are \u201con the formulary\u201d) to morally tenuous (e.g., hospital systems denying care primarily due to cost considerations). The significant difference between these situations and those encountered by the military physician is that, in the military setting, additional legal frameworks and international laws apply. For military physicians worldwide, these include the Geneva Conventions (Cross 2014), the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 2017), the International Code of Medical Ethics (World Medical Association 2014), Regulations in Times of Armed Conflict (World Medical Association 2016), and the Declaration of Tokyo (World Medical Association 2006). For US Military officers, this also includes the Uniform Code of Military Justice (https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title10/subtitleA/part2/chapter47&edition=prelim).",

Arguments for the legitimacy of professional armed forces base their claims on theories of \u201cjust war\u201d. These include justification for going to war (jus ad bellum) and moral conduct of war itself (jus in bello) (Guthrie and Quinlan 2007). Medical personnel in this role have an obligation both to the standards of the medical and martial professions. To the extent that these are in tension, that tension must be resolved on the side of medical ethics. An example of this is the standard of confidentiality. In civilian practice, there is a \u201cduty to notify\u201d appropriate authorities if a patient is a danger to self or others. In the military context, that duty also extends to those patients who present a threat to mission. In such cases, the \u201cminimal necessary\u201d standard is applied, wherein the physician reveals only the minimum necessary information to the commander for him/her to assess and address the situation.

Often times, there is an overwhelming demand for limited medical resources and the need to prioritize care of the sick and injured. Within the US Armed Forces, the triage system categorizes patients into Immediate (requiring surgery with 2 hours), Delayed (requiring surgery, but in stable condition allowing others to receive treatment first), minimal (minor injuries requiring little medical care), and Expectant (non-survivable injuries) (Warner et al. 2011). In military mass casualty situations, expectant patients are attended and given comfort measures, though the limited medical resources are conserved for those with survivable injuries. This situation places the principles of beneficence (potential good for the individual patient) in tension with justice (equal care and resources for all patients). Ultimately, this decision is justified by utilitarian analysis, doing the greatest good, not for individual patients but for the aggregate fighting force.",

Once an enemy can no longer take part in hostilities (e.g., becoming too badly injured or sick, or becoming a POW), the military medical services have a duty to care for these individuals. Moreover, Article 12 of the Geneva Conventions states that only \u201curgent medical reasons\u201d will inform the order in which care is administered (International Committee of the Red Cross 2014). Care must be administered \u201cwithout any adverse distinction founded on race, color, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria.\u201d Although such treatment may generate an emotional response from combatants and medical personnel alike, commitment to treating enemy wounded upholds both the ethical principles of beneficence and justice. It also reinforces a standard of treatment for injured friendly forces. The issue of informed consent deserves specific mention. It can be argued that a detained enemy cannot give truly informed consent given that he/she remains subject to coercion. Military medical personnel must include due consideration of the principle of autonomy in such situations.",

Formal training programs have demonstrated significant improvement in ethical understanding and behaviors among combat troops. It is also clear that human performance and decision-making erodes under acute stress. This background and the low likelihood that military physicians would encounter these dilemmas outside of the combat setting underscores the importance of training in and consideration of these scenarios prior to service in combat. In its Subcommittee report entitled \u201cEthical Guidelines and Practices for US Military Medical Professionals\u201d, the Defense Health Board found that, \u201ca priori education and training provide the best strategies for providing military health care professionals with the skills, experience, and knowledge they can draw on when confronting difficult ethical choices\u201d (Defense Health Board 2015). Participation in actions that conflict with ethical standards of medical practice can cause moral injury to the physician who bears dual agency. Recognition of this very real harm mandates deliberate preparation and training of the military physician prior to entering the theater of conflict as well as adequate support to her/him while executing those duties.",

Every physician faces ethical decisions in clinical patient care, analyzing the options based on the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and social justice, and selecting the best ethical option, usually in conjunction with the patient (shared decision-making). However, unique ethical challenges for physicians present during civilian disease and military combat situations that are often specific to the austere environments in which they occur. These challenges can require physicians to make decisions that are outside the usual parameters of clinical practice.",

Individual physician training in basic and advanced disaster life support, which includes ethical decision-making, is an excellent preparation. It is hoped this introduction to ethical challenges involved in patient care during civilian disasters and military combat will stimulate the reader to engage further with the topics.",
