            "text": "Introduction ! Various herbal antiviral drugs have been developed that interfere with the viral life cycle [1] . During the first appearance of SARS about 50 % of the patients in mainland China were treated successfully with Chinese herbal medicine in addition to Western medicine [2, 3] . Several viruses encode for ion-selective channels that become incorporated into the membrane of the infected cell [4] [5] [6] [7] . Activation of such channels seems to be involved in the process of virus production and release [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Hence, inhibition of the ion channel activation will counteract virus production; this may allow the infected body to build up or strengthen its own immune system. The viral ion channel will, therefore, be a potential candidate for developing new antiviral drugs. The ORF 3a of SARS CoV encodes for an ion-permeable channel. We could previously demonstrate that micromolar concentrations of the anthraquinone emodin can inhibit the 3a channel activity with an IC 50 value of only 20 \u00b5M and also inhibit coronavirus release with a similar sensitivity from infected cells [13] . This indicates that the viral ion channel is an interesting target for antiviral drugs. Emodine as well as various flavonoids (l \" Fig. 1 ) are well known to act as anticancer drugs [14, 15] , but they were also discussed as antiviral drugs [16] . The flavonol kaempferol and its glycosides have been reported previously to have high antiviral activity [1] , but effects on the intracellular events were favoured as an explanation [17, 18] . Here we investigated whether the flavonol kaempferol and kaempferol glycosides can block the 3a channel. In addition, we tested a number of other flavonoids (l \" Fig. 1 ). This manuscript ex-Abstract ! The protein coded by the open-reading-frame 3a of SARS coronavirus has been demonstrated to form a cation-selective channel that may become expressed in the infected cell. The activity of the channel is involved in the mechanism of virus release. Drugs that inhibit the ion channel can, therefore, inhibit virus release, and they could be a source for development of novel therapeutic antiviral agents. Various drugs found in Chinese herbs that are well known as anticancer agents also have an antiviral potency. Here we tested the flavonols kaempferol, kaempferol glycosides, and acylated kaempferol glucoside derivatives with respect to their potency to block the 3a channel. We used the Xenopus oocyte with a heterologously expressed 3a protein as a model system to test the efficacy of the flavonols. Some of these drugs turned out to be potent inhibitors of the 3a channel. The most effective one was the glycoside juglanin (carrying an arabinose residue) with an IC 50 value of 2.3 \u00b5M for inhibition of the 3a-mediated current. Kaempferol derivatives with rhamnose residue also seem to be quite effective. We suggest that viral ion channels, in general, may be a good target for the development of antiviral agents, and that, in particular, kaempferol glycosides are good candidates for 3a channel proteins of coronaviruses. tends preliminary data [1] to investigate the role of this class of compounds in more detail.",

After subtraction of the endogenous contribution (l \" Fig. 2 c) , the current at \u2212 100 mV was reduced to 0.82 \u00b1 0.10 of the current component in the absence of drug; this indicated that the endogenous and the 3a-mediated components exhibited similar sensitivity to kaempferol. This is in contrast to emodin which selectively inhibited the 3amediated current and at 20 \u00b5M already produced more than 50 % block (see [13] ). The poor solubility of kaempferol in water did not allow testing a higher concentration for evaluation of an IC 50 value.

In contrast to kaempferol, the tested kaempferol glycosides hardly affected Ba 2+ -sensitive endogenous current (for juglanin see, e.g., l \" Fig. 3 a) . In oocytes with an expressed 3a protein, stronger effects could be detected than with kaempferol (compare l \" Table 1 ). Juglanin seemed to be the most potent kaempferol glycoside that gave complete inhibition at 20 \u00b5M; even 10 \u00b5M produced nearly complete inhibition. Therefore, we focussed on this drug for a more detailed analysis. l \" Fig. 3 Hence juglanin is about one order of magnitude more potent to block 3a-protein channel than emodine [13] .",

            "text": "As another flavonol, we tested the effect of quercetin, which was reported to also act as an effective drug against virus infections including SARS CoV [23] . We found that the 3a-mediated current was not significantly affected by 10 \u00b5M quercetin (see l \" Table 1) ; concentrations even up to 50 \u00b5M hardly affected the 3a-mediated current. Also the quercetin derivative with an arabinofuranoside, avicularin (not shown), was without any effect. The flavanone naringenin and the isoflavone genistein are also known for their antiviral potency (see, e.g., [24] [25] [26] ), but neither naringenin nor genistein exhibited any significant modulation of the 3a-mediated current (see l \" Table 1 ). Though the flavonols quercetin and avicularin, the flavanone naringenin, and the isoflavone genistein do not affect the activity of the 3a protein, the flavonol kaempferol exhibits a clear inhibition of the 3a-mediated current; the kaempferol glycosides are even more potent inhibitors thus suggesting an importance of sugar residues. The most potent drug was the kaempferol glycoside juglanin with an arabinose residue. Interestingly, the kaempferol glycoside afzelin and the triglycoside with rhamnose residues seem also to be quite effective. In addition to the higher effectivity of the flavonoid glycosides to inhibit the 3a protein ion channel, they show higher solubility in water with higher bioactivity [19, 21] . Though flavonoid glycosides may be absorbed in the small intestine, biodegradation will limit their therapeutical application, and levels in plasma are probably below 1 \u00b5M [21] . An important task for developing new antiviral drugs will therefore have to fo-cus on improving bioactivity [27] ; several strategies have been tackled for increasing bioavailability including drug delivery and metabolic stability (compare [19, 21, 27, 28] ). Activity of the 3a protein results in ion channel gating which allows small cations to cross the membrane. Although the channel shows selectivity for K + , also Na + can penetrate with slightly lower permeability [11] . As a consequence, activity of channel openings will lead to membrane depolarization, and activation of Ltype Ca 2+ channels [29] to an elevation of intracellular Ca 2+ [30] . This could account for the 3a-protein-dependent release of CoV from infected cells via exocytosis. Indeed, inhibition of 3a channel activity blocks virus release; this could be demonstrated by suppression of 3a expression as well as pharmacological inhibition of the 3a channel [11, 13] . This reduction in virus production offers the body the chance to adjust its immune system to counteract the viral attack. Inhibition of ion channels encoded by other viruses could also be demonstrated to inhibit the respective virus production [31] [32] [33] . As a conclusion, we suggest that emodin and kaempferol could form the basis for the development of new antiviral drugs with higher bioavailability. In particular, the glycosides of kaempferol seem to be highly potent candidates for development as anti-coronaviral agents. The fact that these drugs not only block the 3a channel, thus counteracting virus production, but that they also interfere with other steps of the viral life cycle [20] emphasises the importance of multi-target drugs.",

Females of the clawed toad Xenopus laevis (Maosheng Bio-Technology Com.) were anaesthetized with tricane (1 g/L H 2 O, MS222; Sandoz) or in ice water. Parts of the ova- ry were removed and treated with 0.3 units/mL Liberase (Roche) or with 1 mg/mL Collagenase (Sigma) for 3 to 4 h to remove enveloping tissue and to obtain isolated oocytes. The entire procedure follows standard protocols including care of laboratory animals that have been established according to German Animal Protection Law. For expression of 3a protein, oocytes of stage V or VI [34] were selected and injected with 20 or 30 ng cRNA for 3a protein (for details see [11] ) (at 1 ng/nL) two to three days before the experiments; uninjected oocytes served as controls. The cells were stored for 2 days at 19\u00b0C in oocyte Ringer\u02bcs-like solution (G-ORi, see solutions). Experiments were performed at room temperature (24-26\u00b0C).",

Test solution S2 contained 10 mM BaCl 2 in addition. The change in osmolarity due to addition of BaCl 2 did not affect the membrane currents. The difference between the current measured in S1 and S2 was considered as the Ba 2+ -sensitive current component. Both solutions, S1 and S2, contained some DMSO (see below). All stock solutions of drugs were made up in DMSO. Kaempferol was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; two probes of the kaempferol glycosides (juglanin, kaempferol-3-O-\u03b1-L-arabinofuranoside, and afzelin, kaempferol-3-O-\u03b1-L-rhamnoside) were kindly provided by Prof. X. Hao and Dr. Y. Wang, Kunming, China, or bought from BioBioPHa. Kaempferol acylated glucosides were previously isolated from polar extracts from the leaves of the plant Quercus ilex L. [35] ; the kaempferol triglycoside was an isolate from Viola odorata L. [36] . Isolation was carried out mainly by column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 and silica gel. The structure of the compounds was established by NMR experiments. The purity was checked by NMR and high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector and was over 95 %.

To determine steady-state current-voltage dependencies (IV curves), membrane currents were averaged during the last 20 ms of 200 ms, rectangular voltage pulses from \u2212 150 to + 30 mV in 10-mV increments; the pulses were applied from a holding potential of \u2212 60 mV.
