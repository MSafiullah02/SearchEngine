In order to evaluate possible fluctuations of AGP concentration not dependent on FCoV status, these three cats were sampled every 30 days.(B)Asymptomatic FCoV-infected cats: 19 cats from three different catteries:-Group B1 included approximately 40 Persian cats from a cattery where animals with specific problems (pregnancies, parturitions, infectious diseases, etc) were kept separated, while non-symptomatic cats shared the same environment. Sporadic cases of FIP (1\u20134 per year) had occurred in the cattery in past years, suggesting that the cattery was endemically infected with FCoV. Ten animals (four males and six females), aged 5\u201314 years, were randomly selected and sampled every 30 days over a 7 month period according to the protocol suggested by Addie and Jarrett (2001) in order to identify carriers and shedders.-Group B2 included 10 homebred Persian cats living in a private household on which cases of FIP had never been recorded. Four cats (one male and three females, 4\u201311 years old) were randomly selected and sampled every 30 days over a 4 month period.-Group B3 included five homebred domestic shorthair cats (one male and four females, aged 2\u20139 years) living in a private household in which only one case of FIP had occurred 4 years before this study. All these cats were sampled every 30 days over a 4 month period.\n\n",

To avoid sampling errors, cats were kept in cages on the day of sampling and each sample was placed in a separate plastic envelope and transported to the laboratory. Cats from catteries B2 and B3 could freely move in their breeding facilities. Thus, it was not possible to monitor the faecal excretion of FCoVs in individual cats. For this reason, the FCoV status of these cats was evaluated only by measuring anti-FCoV titres in blood. As regards cattery B3, however, the referring veterinarian periodically checked by RT-PCR on faecal swabs many cats of the cattery, with only occasional positive results.",

The presence of anti-FCoV antibody titres was investigated using an indirect immunofluorescence test performed on 10 multiwell slides produced at the University of Zurich according to Osterhaus et al (1977). Briefly, slides were prepared by coating each well with 4.5 \u00d7 103 PD-5 cells, half of which were infected with swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which serologically cross-reacts with FCoVs (Osterhaus et al 1977). After coating the wells, slides were fixed with acetone for stabilisation, and were then dried, frozen and stored at \u221230\u00b0C until use. Serology was performed by making twofold dilutions of each serum sample (1:25 to 1:400). Twenty microlitres of each dilution was applied to one well each and incubated (30 min, 37\u00b0C) in a humidified chamber. Slides were then washed three times with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), dried, and 15 \u03bcl of fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rabbit-anti cat immunoglobulin (Nordic Immunological Laboratories, Tilburg, The Netherlands) was added to each well. After incubation (30 min, 37\u00b0C in a humidified chamber), the slides were washed, dried, cover-slipped with PBS and Kaiser's glycerin (1:3 ratio) and examined under a fluorescence microscope. Dilutions showing a distinct fluorescence signal in about one-half of the cells were evaluated as positive, while reactions that did not show any positive signal or that were designated as dubious were judged as negative. Samples that were still positive at a 1:400 dilution were further diluted on a twofold basis until a negative result was obtained.",

All the faecal samples were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. After thawing, 1 g of each faecal sample was homogenised in 6 ml of saline solution and centrifuged (2400 \u00d7 \ng for 45 min). The supernatants were removed and filtered using a pore size of 0.22 \u03bcm (Millipore, Billerica, USA). Three millilitres of each filtered supernatant was applied to a Centricon YM-30 column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, USA) in order to concentrate viral particles to a final volume of 140 \u03bcl. Viral RNA was then extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) and reverse-transcribed using a Ready-To-Go You-Prime First-Strand Beads Kit (Amersham Biosciences) with the FCoV specific primer p211 (20 pmol/ml) designed by Herrewegh et al (1995). The cDNAs, obtained as described above, were amplified by PCR using a reaction mix composed of 1 \u03bcl of cDNA, 1 \u00d7 buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM Deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 0.25 U of Taq polymerase (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and 1 \u03bcM of each primer (primers p211 and p205) (Herrewegh et al 1995). The thermal cycling protocol used was as follows: 94\u00b0C (2 min), 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C (45 s), annealing at 62\u00b0C (40 s), elongation at 72\u00b0C (40 s) and a final elongation step at 72\u00b0C (10 min). In each assay, negative controls (reaction mix without cDNA) and positive controls (FCoV cDNA amplified from the vaccine Primucell FIP, Pfizer Animal Health, Exton, PA, USA) were included. Amplicons were then run on a 2% agarose gel and visualised using an ultraviolet transilluminator. Based on the presence or absence of amplicons, cats were classified as positive or negative for viral shedding.",

The latter was investigated by evaluating anti-FCoV antibody titres and/or faecal shedding of FCoVs in SPF cats and in cats from catteries with different levels of FCoV infection. Unfortunately, FCoV shedding of individual cats could only be assessed in one cattery (group B1) but, taken together, our results from epidemiology, serology and/or faecal shedding allowed us to classify the catteries as \u2018high prevalence\u2019 (group B1) and \u2018low prevalence\u2019 (groups B2 and B3) of FCoV infection. The low number of FIP cases recorded in the past, the negative results of PCRs for FCoV genome performed by the referring veterinarian and the persistently low antibody titres recorded in our study, indicate a low rate of FCoV infection in groups B2 and B3, as, although seronegative shedders have been reported (Meli et al 2004), viral load usually correlates with the antibody titre (Gut et al 1999).",

This percentage differs from what was reported in the study cited above, which classified shedders as persistent and recurrent shedders (80% and 15%, of cats, respectively). This difference might depend on a different level of contamination of catteries by FCoVs, on a different genetic pattern of cats (Foley and Pedersen 1996), or on the differences in the PCR protocol, as we introduced a concentration step that might have increased the sensitivity of the method. It should be emphasised, however, that cats from the study of Addie and Jarrett (2001) were housed individually, while in the current study cats shared a common environment. This does not allow us to rule out recurrent re-infection as a likely cause of the persistent positivity of faecal PCR.",

Our results, therefore, confirm that serum AGP levels fluctuate over the time as previously reported (Giordano et al 2004). In addition, we demonstrated that these fluctuations were greater in the cattery with the higher prevalence of FCoV infection (group B1). Moreover, in group B1, AGP levels increased at sampling 5, 2 weeks before the occurrence of FIP cases in the cattery, but not at sampling 7, which was performed 1 month before the second episode of FIP. The difference in AGP response between samplings 5 and 7 might depend on the different time interval between the sampling and the occurrence of FIP cases.",

A more objective evaluation of the FCoVs' viral burden could have been obtained by quantitative RT-PCR on faeces or blood, which would also have allowed us to have more detailed information on a possible relationship between individual AGP levels, individual FCoV shedding and viraemia. Nevertheless, as it has been demonstrated that antibody titres correlate with viral load (Gut et al 1999), the increase of both antibody titres and serum AGP levels recorded at sampling 5 suggests that the occurrence of FIP cases is preceded, in non-symptomatic cats, by an increase of viral load and by an inflammatory response. However, it is unclear whether this response is evoked only by the higher viral load or if it is a specific and protective response against \u2018highly pathogenic\u2019 FCoVs. Sequencing of FCoVs isolated during this study may help to answer this question. However, the hypothesis that certain AGP responses might protect from the disease is exciting. AGP has important immunomodulatory functions (Bories et al., 1990, Vasson et al., 1994) and, in humans, changes in the AGP glycosylation pattern are associated with resistance or susceptibility to some viral diseases (Rabehi et al 1995). Interestingly, AGP isolated from cats with FIP is hyposialylated (Ceciliani et al 2004). It can, therefore, be postulated that all the cats in a cattery with endemic FCoV infection respond to increased viral burden by increasing the production of AGP but that only cats with hyposialylated AGP have persistently increased AGP levels and develop FIP.",

This probably represents a non-specific response to the increased viral burden, which, in turn, is associated with a high probability of FIP outbreaks. In the future, we will attempt to clarify whether the increase in serum AGP levels is a consequence of a higher viral load of non-mutated FCoVs or a protective response against mutated viral strains. In addition, the results of the present study suggest that AGP might be a useful tool to monitor FCoV\u2013host interactions in FCoV-endemic catteries.",
