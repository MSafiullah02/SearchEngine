N95 masks offer protection against droplet and airborne transmission of 95% of particles more than 0.3 microns in size. Surgical face masks protect against COVID-19 droplet transmission but do not protect against aerosolized small particles. Wear disposable caps and beard covers to decrease the risk of hand contamination by touching hair that may have been exposed to droplets. 4. Do mock drills for correct donning and doffing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gown, face mask, eye shields and gloves. 5. Do Mock intubation/extubation drills wearing PPE. 6. Aerosol-generating procedures are tracheal intubation and extubation, suctioning, nebulization, CPAP, BiPAP or high flow nasal oxygen therapy. Aerosolization is also increased when more than one attempt at intubation is required.",

At the end of the day, clean and disinfect PAC clinics and Pain clinics by thoroughly wiping the surfaces of furniture, equipment and floor with 2 to 3% hydrogen peroxide. 9. Learn the correct method of using and disposing surgical masks. All PPEs after exposure should be locked in a double zip lock plastic bag and discarded in a touch-free disposal. 10. After returning from hospital, take bath before greeting family members. Change the clothes and keep them in wash bucket. 11. Institutes should counsel patients actively to reschedule elective/semi-emergency surgical procedures. This is especially for the elderly, paediatric and immuno-compromised patients. 12.

A minimum of one hour is planned between cases to allow OT staff to send the patient back to the ward, conduct through decontamination of all surfaces, screens, keyboard, cables, monitors and anaesthesia machine with 2 to 3% hydrogen peroxide spray disinfection, 2-5 g/l chlorine disinfectant, or 75% alcohol wiping of solid surfaces of the equipment and floor. The hydrogen peroxide vaporizer is an added precaution to decontaminate the OT. 27. All unused items on the drug tray and airway trolley should be assumed to be contaminated and discarded.

The case must be reported by the local health authorities to the national body within 24 hours in their own jurisdiction and transferred to isolation cabin in the ICU. 2. As many ICUs are not equipped with negative and positive pressure regulations in India, an alternative approach is using HEPA-Carbon-Photocatalysis air purification systems as alternate means of source control. 3. Supportive therapy in the form of supplemental oxygen and antipyretics should be immediately started. 4. Liberal fluid administration should be avoided for risk of worsening oxygenation and periodic hemodynamic assessment used to guide goal-directed therapy. 5. Along with it, adequate nutritional support with balanced proportions of proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals boosts immunity to fight the infection. 6. Empirical antimicrobials must be given within one hour based on the clinical diagnosis, local epidemiology and susceptibility data to cover all likely pathogens causing community acquired pneumonia even if suspected to have COVID. 7. Post tracheal intubation by rapid sequence intubation, lung protective strategies involving use of lower tidal volumes (4-8 ml/kg predicted body weight), high PEEP and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure <30 cmH 2 O) for meeting the pH goal of 7.30-7.45 have been postulated to prevent volutrauma, barotraumas, atelectotrauma and biotrauma. 8. Deep sedation with midazolam, propofol or fentanyl infusions are recommended to curb patient's respiratory drive and prevent dyssynchrony. The few indications of continuous neuromuscular blockade in the setting of severe ARDS are ventilator dyssynchrony, inability to achieve target tidal volumes or refractory hypoxemia/hypercapnia. In fulminating cases, prone ventilation for 12-18 hours per day is useful.",
