On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). As of April 7, 1,279,722 cases were confirmed, and 72,616 (5.7%) patients died in 211 countries. In the beginning of the outbreak, COVID-19 was considered a zoonotic disease with limited human-to-human transmission. Initially, pneumonia cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Soon after, this emerging coronavirus was found to be highly infectious. The basic reproductive number ranged from 2.2 to 3.58, with a mean serial interval of 7.5 days. 1e3 Children are more susceptible than adults to some infectious diseases, which may cause fatal outcomes. For instance, young children, especially infants aged less than 6 months, have higher mortality rates due to seasonal influenza infection than individuals in other age groups. 4 During enterovirus outbreaks, enterovirus 71 and echoviruses lead to death in different age groups of children. 5, 6 Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b were associated with high childhood mortality in the era without conjugate vaccines. 7 The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to critically ill cases. Fever and cough are the most common manifestations in symptomatic adults. 8, 9 It seems that SARS-CoV-2 is less invasive in children than in adults. However, reports about the clinical characteristics of pediatric COVID-19 are limited.

The number of COVID-19 cases has increased worldwide.

There are relatively few cases among children. Patients under 19 years old accounted for 2.2% of 44,672 confirmed cases. 24 Only one death was recorded.

Most of the authors in our review used the \"Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for 2019-nCoV. 5th ed\" to categorize disease severity. 10 We unified the pooled data according to this classification. Based on this rule, the disease severity in children seems to be mild or moderate. Mild disease makes the clinical features subtle and transient. Hence, the proportion of asymptomatic patients varied among studies. Also, one retrospective study was conducted before mid-January. 11 The result might be representative of the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, more symptomatic or severe cases were reported, the same as adults, 8, 9 which make moderate heterogeneity of the pooled data in clinical features.

ACE2 is the primary entry receptor for both coronaviruses. After replacing four out of five important interface amino acid residues from SARS-CoV, the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for ACE2 is weaker. 27 Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 still exhibits significant binding affinity to human ACE2.

In China, clinicians should have a suspicion of COVID-19 when patients meet one epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations. According to our literature review, the main symptoms in pediatric COVID-19 are fever and cough, resembling common viral illness frequently encountered in school or kindergarten. 33 Epidemiological features are the main diagnostic clue. Children with familial clustering, contact with infected cases, travel or living in areas with persistent local transmission within 14 days prior to disease onset are at risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Since COVID-19 has spread to many other countries, the epidemiological history should be modified outside mainland China. In addition, asymptomatic cases are a potential source of infection. Although only 1% of the patients had been reported as asymptomatic, 24 26% of infected children were asymptomatic in the pooled data. Namely, children may act as silent carriers or spreaders. 34 Notably, an asymptomatic infection does not always mean a carrier. Chan et al. presented a familial cluster with one family member, a 10-year-old boy, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Without symptoms, he had ground glass lung opacities identified incidentally by CT scan. 35 A similar scenario occurred in another report: chest CT performed in one asymptomatic child revealed patchy density. 16 This finding raised another issue that needs to be further considered. According to our review, the radiographic findings in pediatric COVID-19 are similar to those in adults. 36 In China, chest CT has been used as a screening tool for COVID-19.

Unfortunately, presymptomatic or asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported. 38, 39 The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via asymptomatic children is reasonable. To date, no clustering or asymptomatic transmission among children has been documented. There are some possible explanations. First, the outbreak of COVID-19 occurred during winter vacation for students. Moreover, the Chinese government imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions in Hubei Province beginning on January 24, 2020. Furthermore, the government announced that the Lunar New Year holiday would be extended to February 2, 2020 across the country. The new semester in school will also be postponed indefinitely.
