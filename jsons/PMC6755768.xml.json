The main reason given by 46.5% of participants for rejecting the vaccine was distrust; however, 34% had previously received the seasonal flu vaccine. Furthermore, 68% considered influenza A (H1N1) a risk to their families. The researchers reported that handwashing was the most common measure of infection prevention reported by 47.5%, followed by the influenza vaccine (28%).

The previous respondents disposed of their used paper tissues properly in a waste bin, and 91.2% claimed that they did not spit in public areas.

However, 81.9% washed their hands if they covered their noses and mouths when they sneezed. Only 35.8% of the interviewees claimed to follow the handwashing steps given by the Ministry of Health. The use of face masks was moderate, with 76.5% of the respondents using face mask during a pandemic. Furthermore, 75.2% ensured that their face masks were properly fitted and covered their mouths and noses. About 74.3% wore the Ministry of Health recommended face masks during the pandemic. Slightly more than half of the respondents (54.0%) used face masks when they had influenza-like symptoms, and 40.3% admitted to reusing their face masks more than once. Respondents' practices on social distancing were appropriate. Those who avoided going to or taking their children unnecessarily to such crowded places as shopping areas were 88.9% and 83.2%, respectively. Only 64.6% practiced safety measures such as the wearing of face masks in crowded areas, and 30.1% used hand sanitizers when necessary. As for self-health care, the majority (79.2%) avoided sharing forks and spoons with friends during a meal. Only 37.2% of the respondents took the initiative to look for additional information on influenza A (H1N1) other than what was given by the government. About a third of the respondents took food supplements during the pandemic phase. A high percentage (68.6%) of the respondents did not wash their hands after shaking hands with other people. Ethnicity, education, income, and practice score predicted the knowledge score. Income and knowledge scores were predictors of practice score.

In this survey, only 13.7% had received the seasonal flu vaccine. A large proportion (62.8%) of the participants did not intend to take the vaccine. Their primary reasons were that they were unsure of the benefits, and afraid of the adverse effects. This poor attitude emphasized the importance of conveying appropriate messages to the public to make them understand better the benefits of the vaccine and improve its uptake. Moreover, poor attitude has an impact on infection transmission. Therefore, attitudes should be improved to prevent the spread of an outbreak.
