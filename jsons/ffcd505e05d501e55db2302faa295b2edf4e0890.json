Diagnosis of HLHS with 100% accuracy at 18-24 weeks gestation is accepted as the rule [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , although two atypical cases of HLHS have been described [4, 5] in which a left ventricle of initially normal size but poor contractility was noted during detailed fetal echocardiography. Despite the high yield of fetal echocardiography in the high-risk group, most cases of major congenital heart disease will be found in the low-risk population group (2-3 per thousand) . The fourchamber cardiac view, a standard part of the routine obstetric ultrasound examination [2, 3] , is said to exclude most severe congenital heart disease (HLHS, atresia of the mitral, pulmonary or tricuspid valves, double inlet ventricle, atrioventricular canal defect) [2, 3] , from 16 weeks gestation onwards. It has come to be expected that any competent obstetric ultrasound examination will detect HLHS and most (but not all) other severe congenital heart anomalies from 16 weeks gestation onwards, using the four-chamber view alone. If cine-loop technology is not available, it is difficult at times to obtain an ideal four-chamber view on hard copy during a routine timelimited obstetric ultrasound examination, and some reliance is made inevitably on the real-time appearance seen by the sonographer.",
