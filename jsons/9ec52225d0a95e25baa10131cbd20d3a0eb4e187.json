            "text": "The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 is rapidly spreading all over the world, generating a high number of total deaths. The contemporary environmental and sustainability debate generates new or relatively unexplored problems. One of the current questions is: how high polluting industrialization and a less cleaner production affect the diffusion of COVID-19 infection? This study endeavors to explain the relation between air pollution and particulate compounds emissions, wind resources and energy, and the diffusion of COVID-19 infection to provide insights of sustainable policy to prevent future epidemics. The statistical analysis here focuses on case study of Italy, one of the countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths. Results reveal two main findings: 1) cities in regions with high wind speed and a high wind energy production in MW have a lower number of infected individuals of COVID-19 infection and total deaths; 2) cities located in hinterland zones (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) with high polluting industrialization, low wind speed and less cleaner production have a greater number of infected individuals and total deaths. Hence, cities with pollution industrialization and low renewable energy have also to consider low wind speed and other climatological factors that can increase stagnation of the air in the atmosphere with potential problems for public health in the presence of viral agents. Results here suggest that current pandemic of Coronavirus disease and future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection cannot be solved only with research and practice of medicine, immunology and microbiology but also with a proactive strategy directed to interventions for a sustainable development. Overall, then, this study has to conclude that a strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection must also be based on sustainability science to support a higher level of renewable energy and cleaner production to reduce polluting industrialization and, as result, the factors determining the spread of coronavirus disease and other infections in society.",

The Coronavirus infection, started in China in 2019, is an on-going global health problem that is generating a socioeconomic crisis and negative world economic outlook projections (Saadat et al., 2020) . Manifold studies suggest a possible relation between air pollution and particulate compounds emissions and diffusion of COVID-19 infection (Fattorini and Regoli, 2020; Frontera et al., 2020) . Scholars also state that high level of air pollution can increase viral infectivity and lethality of COVID-19 infection (Contini and Costabile, 2020) . Conticini et al. (2020) argue that population living in regions with high levels of particulate compounds emissions has also a high probability to develop respiratory disorders because of infective agents. In fact, the highest level of COVID-19 infection is in the USA, Spain, Italy, UK, Russia, China, Brazil, France, etc. that are countries having in some regions a very high level of air pollution Frontera et al, 2020) . Studies confirm correlations between exposure to air pollution, diffusion and virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 within regions with population having a high incidence of respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Lung Cancer (Fattorini and Regoli, 2020; Coccia, 2014 Coccia, , 2015 . Lewtas (2007) shows that exposures to combustion emissions and ambient fine particulate air pollution are associated with genetic damages. Long-term epidemiologic studies report an increased risk of all causes of mortality, cardiopulmonary mortality, and lung cancer mortality associated with increasing exposures to air pollution (cf., Coccia and Wang, 2015) . Ogen (2020, p.4 ) finds that high NO2 concentrations associated with downwards airflows cause of NO2 buildup close to the surface. This geographical aspect of regions, associated with specific atmospheric 3 | P a g e Coccia M. (2020) How sustainable environments have reduced the diffusion of coronavirus disease 2019: the interaction between spread of COVID-19 infection, polluting industrialization, wind (renewable) energy conditions of low wind, prevents the dispersion of air pollutants, which are one of the factors of a high incidence of respiratory disorders and inflammation in population of some European regions, such as Norther Italy. In short, the exposure of air pollution, associated with Coronavirus infection, can be a driver of high rate of mortality in Italy (14.06%), Spain (11.90%), UK (14.37%), Belgium (16.40%), France (15.32%), etc. (cf., Center for System Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins, 2020). The study by van Doremalen et al. (2020) revels that in China viral particles of SARS-CoV-2 may be suspended in the air for various minutes and this result can explain the high total number of infected people and deaths of COVID-19 infection in the USA, Spain, Russia, France, Italy, Brazil, Turkey, Iran, etc. (cf., Center for System Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins, 2020). In general, these studies suggest the hypothesis that the atmosphere having a high level of air pollutant, associated with certain climatological factors, may support a longer permanence of viral particles in the air, fostering a diffusion of COVID-19 infection based on mechanisms of air pollution-to-human transmission in addition to human-to-human transmission (Frontera et a., 2020) . In order to extend the investigation of these critical aspects in the development of COVID-19 outbreaks worldwide, in the presence of polluting industrialization, the goal of this study is to analyze the relation between infected people, air pollution, wind speed and inter-related renewable wind energy production that can explain some critical relationships determining the diffusion of COVID-19 and negative effect in environment and public health.",

As a matter of fact, cities with high polluting industrialization, mainly in Northern Italy (also having a low wind speed and as a consequence low wind energy production), have a stagnation of air pollution in the atmosphere that can support diffusion of COVID-19 infection (Contini and Costabile, 2020; Conticini et al., 2020) . The implications for a sustainable policy are clear: COVID-19 outbreak has low diffusion in regions with low polluting industrialization and high production of renewable (wind) energy. Northern Italian region covered by the study, as a consequence, in future should reduce pollution industrialization and particulate compounds emissions, so that the accelerated transmission dynamics of COVID-19 viral infectivity are not triggered.",

            "text": "In order to reinforce these conclusions with a perspective of sustainable policies, Xu et al. (2020) found out the effect of moisture on explosive growth in fine particulate matter (PM), and propose a new approach for the simulation of fine PM growth and dissipation in ambient air. In particular, winds significantly aid the dissipation of fine PM, and high concentrations of fine PM only persisted for a very short time and dissipated after several hours. The role of climatological factors, such as wind speed and direction, temperature, and humidity are critical for urban ventilation and the pollutant concentration in the streets of cities (Yuan et al. 2019) . Considering the benefit of wind as resource that can reduce air pollution and as a consequence viral infectivity with main public health benefits, Gu et al. (2020) argue that a strategy to enhance air quality in cities is improving urban ventilation: the ability of an urban area to dilute pollutants and heat by improving the exchange of air between areas within and above the urban canopy. Of course, urban ventilation is a function of a manifold urban geometry characteristics, e.g., frontal and plan area density, and the aspect ratio of urban morphology. Studies show that variations of building height have beneficial effects in terms of breathability levels, whereas larger aspect ratios of urban canyons can lead to high levels of pollutant concentrations inside the streets of cities. Hence, cities located in hinterland zones of the Northern Italian region 15 | P a g e Coccia M. (2020) How sustainable environments have reduced the diffusion of coronavirus disease 2019: the interaction between spread of polluting industrialization, wind (renewable) energy with low wind speed have an urban climatology and aspects of urban and regional topography that sustain the stagnation of air pollution that can support the spread of viral infectivity in fall and winter season. Hence, these regions have to reduce the level of particulate compounds emissions applying long-run sustainable polices directed to reduce polluting industrialization and support the production of renewable energy (Wang and Zhu, 2020) . In fact, health and economic benefits associated with national and local reduction of air pollution are now rarely contested. Cui et al. (2020) , based on a study in China, show that where reductions in ambient air pollution and particulate compounds emissions have avoided more than 2,300 premature deaths and more than 15,80 related morbidity cases in 2017, with a total of about US$ 318 million in economic benefits. In addition, these scholars argue that reduction of PM2.5 concentrations to 15 \u03bcg/m 3 would result in reductions of 70% in total PM2.5-related non-accidental mortality and 95% in total PM2.5-related morbidity, with economic benefits of more than US$ 1,289.5 million. In short, sustainable policies that reduce air pollution and particulate compounds emissions generate significant environmental, public health, social and economic benefits. This study suggests that in order to prevent epidemics similar to COVID-19 and other infections, nations have to apply a sustainable policy directed to reduce air pollution that affects public health and amplifies the negative effects of airborne viral diseases. In addition, the policy for a sustainable development has to consider the urban climatology with the study of climatic properties of urban areas (Gu et al., 2020) and support renewable energy, such as wind resource, that create the environmental conditions for the reduction of air pollution on trans-regional level (Wang and Zhu, 2020) . Moreover, high surveillance and proper biosafety procedures in public and private institutes of virology that study viruses and new viruses to avoid that may be accidentally spread in surrounding environments with damages for population and vegetation. In this context, international collaboration among scientists is basic to address these risks, support decisions of policymakers to prevent future pandemic creating potential huge socioeconomic issues worldwide (cf., Riou and Althaus, 2020; Yao et al., 2020; cf., Coccia, 2005 cf., Coccia, , 2009 cf., Coccia, , 2015a cf., Coccia, , 2017b cf., Coccia, , 2018 cf., Coccia, , 2019a cf., Coccia, , 2020b Coccia and Watts, 2020) . In short, the concentration in specific areas of a combination of climate with low wind, a specific urban climatology of hinterland cities, high polluting industrialization, aspects of regional topography and physical geography sustains, in fall and winter season, the stagnation of air pollution and particulate compounds emissions that seems to have supported the spread of COVID-19 infection (cf., Contini and Costabile, 2020; Conticini et al., 2020; Fattorini and Regoli, 2020) . New findings here show that geo-environmental factors may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 in northern Italian cities, leading to a higher number of infected individuals and deaths.",
