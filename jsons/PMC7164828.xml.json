            "text": "For several years, nasal epithelial cells (NEC) were considered to play a simple role of a mucosal barrier while being involved in the secretion of mucous or removal of foreign agents by their cilia [1]. However, recent studies have shown that epithelial cells have a much wider range of activities including the release of eicosanoids [2, 3], endopeptidases [4], cytokines and chemokines [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Epithelial cells in allergic individuals (asthmatics and rhinitics) are in an activated state, as shown by the increased expression of adhesion molecule\u2010like intercellular adhesion molecule\u20101 (ICAM\u20101) and vascular cell adhesion molecule\u20101 (VCAM\u20101) [10, 11], and the increased production of inflammatory mediators like IL\u20106, IL\u20108, granulocyte\u2010macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor (GM\u2010CSF), TNF\u2010\u03b1 [8, 9] thus contributing to the enhancement of the allergic reaction. However, epithelial cells may also play other important roles via direct cell\u2010to\u2010cell interaction. A proportion of NEC has been reported to express the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II molecule (HLA\u2010DR) [9, 12, 13, 14, 15]. We therefore hypothesized that NEC may probably play a role in antigen presentation.",

            "text": "In addition to HLA\u2010DR, CD80 and CD86 (B7\u20101 and 2) are key co\u2010stimulatory molecules involved in antigen presentation [16]. Optimal activation of T cells requires both co\u2010stimulation and T cell receptor engagement. Antigen presentation in the absence of co\u2010stimulation may lead to T cell anergy. Co\u2010stimulatory interactions between the B7 family ligands expressed on antigen\u2010presenting cells (APC) and their receptors on T cells play critical roles in the growth, differentiation and death of T cells [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Engagement of the T cell co\u2010stimulatory receptor CD28 by its ligands CD80 and CD86 augments the activation of T cells and promotes T cell survival. The question as to whether NEC expresses co\u2010stimulatory molecules is relevant because epithelial cells express MHC Class II molecules. However, little is known about the expression of co\u2010stimulatory molecules on NEC. To elucidate the possible role of NEC in antigen presentation, we examined the expression of HLA\u2010DR, CD80 and CD86 in NEC and its regulation by cytokines. We also examined the potential of cultured nasal epithelial cells (CNEC) in inducing antigen\u2010specific proliferation of autologous T cell.",

In fact, short\u2010term exposure to diesel exhaust in healthy human volunteers has demonstrated an increase in the release of inflammatory mediators, increased IgE synthesis and up\u2010regulation of leucocyte adhesion molecule expression [22]. In vitro studies have shown that diesel exhaust particles (DEP) can enhance the cytokine secretion from epithelial cells [23], but its effects on cell surface adhesion molecules like HLA\u2010DR and CD86 have not yet been studied. We therefore examined the effect of DEP on the expression of HLA\u2010DR and CD86 in CNEC.",

However, epithelial cells may also play other important roles via direct cell\u2010to\u2010cell interaction. In this study, we noticed the expression of HLA\u2010DR on NEC in patients with AR. HLA\u2010DR is known to play a significant role in antigen presentation to T cells [16], and CD80 and CD86 are essential to this function as co\u2010stimulatory molecules. Signals transduced through the T cell receptor after antigen recognition are not sufficient for full T cell activation. Recent studies have demonstrated that at least two signals provided by APC are required to induce effective T cell activation [27]. The first signal is antigen specific and occurs after T cell receptor recognition of the MHC\u2010antigen complex. The second signal, often termed the co\u2010stimulatory signal is produced through a set of receptor and co\u2010receptor interactions between APC and T cells. More specifically, the interaction of CD80 or CD86 on APC with CD28 on T cells is required for full T cell activation and effector function [28, 29]. The importance of these interactions is reflected in the observations that T cell receptor recognition of the MHC\u2013antigen complex in the absence of co\u2010stimulatory signals can lead to the induction of anergy [18, 27]. Recent studies have suggested that structural cells, such as keratinocytes [30], gastric epithelial cells [31] and colonic epithelial cells, also expressed CD80 and CD86 [32] and could provide co\u2010stimulatory signals through these molecules. Ye et al. [31] demonstrated that the human gastric epithelial cell line and freshly isolated epithelial cells from gastric biopsies expressed CD80 and CD86, and T cell proliferation by gastric epithelial cell was significantly inhibited by anti\u2010CD86 mAb. Nakazawa et al. [32] demonstrated that freshly isolated colonic epithelial cells from patients with ulcerative colitis efficiently co\u2010stimulated the proliferation of CD4+ T cells, and this response was significantly inhibited by anti\u2010CD86 mAb. In the present study, we demonstrated an increased expression of HLA\u2010DR and CD86 in freshly isolated nasal scrapings of patients with SAR to JCP in\u2010season as compared with that off\u2010season. We also demonstrated an increased expression of HLA\u2010DR and CD86 in NEC of patients with PAR to HDM. The increase in percentage positive NEC expressing CD86 and HLA\u2010DR that is increased in\u2010season in SAR patients, as analysed by immunohistochemistry, is comparable with the increase in percentage\u2010positive NEC expressing HLA\u2010DR or CD86 of PAR patients in response to relevant cytokines or DEP plus antigen as analysed by FACS. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that NEC can function as APC through the expression of HLA\u2010DR and CD86. CD80 expression was not detected in NEC by immunohistochemical staining, and anti\u2010CD80 mAb could not inhibit the epithelial cell\u2010induced T cell proliferation. These findings suggest that CD86 is more important as compared with CD80 in regulating antigen presentation by NEC in patients with AR.",

In a previous study using immunohistochemical analysis, dendritic cells (professional APC) were reported in the nasal epithelial layer, but numerically these cells are very few in number [33, 34]. Antigen\u2010presenting function by NEC could be important because of their predominance in number in the nasal epithelial layer. Godthelp et al. [34] reported that the number of HLA\u2010DR\u2010positive NECs did not increase after 2 weeks of antigen provocation out of season in SAR (grass pollen) patients. However, in the present study, HLA\u2010DR was up\u2010regulated in\u2010season in NEC as the nasal epithelial scrapings were obtained from patients under natural exposure to allergen and during the peak season in a heavy pollen JCP season. These observations suggest that sufficient natural exposure to allergen is more important to induce a significant up\u2010regulation of HLA\u2010DR in NEC to of SAR patients.",

            "text": "There is increasing evidence that AR or asthma, chronic airway inflammatory diseases characterized by reversible airway obstruction, hyper\u2010reactivity and lymphocyte/eosinophil recruitment are driven and maintained by chronically activated T cells with a T\u2010helper 2 (Th2) phenotype. These T cells promote the activation and recruitment of B cells and regulate the Ig class switch to the development of antigen\u2010specific IgE responses [35, 36, 37, 38]. We previously reported that a majority of the CD4+ T cells in the nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitics co\u2010expressed the CD45RO surface molecule, and a predominant proportion of CD4+ T cells in the nasal epithelium were CD45RO+ (memory T cells) [39]. These T cells can be activated more easily as compare with the na\u00efve T cells. Epithelial cells are in direct contact with the inhalant allergens and based on the presence of the memory T cells in the epithelial layer and the capacity of epithelial cells to induce antigen\u2010specific proliferation of T cells, epithelial cells may play more important roles in on\u2010going allergic inflammation. While we have shown that mast cell\u2013epithelial cell interaction contributes to enhancing allergic inflammation [40], airway epithelial cell\u2010induced T cell activation may significantly contribute to the development of chronic airway inflammatory diseases such as AR or asthma. Furthermore, in separate studies, we have shown that NEC express the \u03b1 and \u03b3 chains of the high\u2010affinity IgE receptor (Fc\u025bRI), further emphasizing their potential role in the recognition of IgE\u2010complexed allergens. Moreover, we have also shown that IL\u20104 can up\u2010regulate the expression of the Fc\u025bRI \u03b1 chain in NEC, suggesting an up\u2010regulation of antigen\u2010presenting function in an enhanced Th2 microenvironment as in the case of allergic inflammation [41].",

Bachert et al. [42] previously reported the increased levels of IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 in nasal secretions from patients with AR. This finding suggests the possibility that the increased levels of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines like IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 in\u2010season in patients with JCP may contribute towards the up\u2010regulation of the CD86 expression in NEC. In contrast, a lower level of IFN\u2010\u03b3 mRNA was observed in the nasal mucosa of patients with PAR [43] and in the nasal mucosa of patients with SAR after the allergen provocation test [44]. We demonstrated modest levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 in the nasal mucosa of PAR patients even though the levels were lower than in those with chronic infective rhinitis [45]. Linden et al. [46] demonstrated high levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 in nasal lavage fluid from subjects with acute infectious rhinitis caused by coronavirus inoculation, in contrast, and lower levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 in subjects with AR after allergen challenge. These findings suggest the possibility that respiratory viral infections can up\u2010regulate the APC function of NEC through the enhanced expression of HLA\u2010DR induced by IFN\u2010\u03b3 and this may in part explain the aggravation of allergic symptoms upon viral infection.",

            "text": "Epidemiological studies have shown a significant association between exposure to various pollutants and increase in allergic diseases. DEP has been demonstrated to have an adjuvant activity for IgE synthesis in vivo [26, 47]. Diaz\u2010Sanchez et al. showed that transnasal challenges of the DEP\u2010derived extract in humans enhanced local IgE and cytokine production [25, 48, 49], and combined DEP and ragweed allergen challenge enhanced local ragweed\u2010specific IgE [50]. We demonstrated that DEP up\u2010regulated the expression of HLA\u2010DR in CNEC and this up\u2010regulation was enhanced by a combined stimulation of DEP and mite antigen (Der f II). Although DEP alone did not up\u2010regulate the expression of CD86, the combined stimulation of DEP and Der f II significantly up\u2010regulated the expression of CD86 in CNEC. In vitro studies have shown that mite allergens induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines from airway epithelial cells through the activation of protease\u2010activated receptor (PAR)\u20102 [51]. On the other hand, DEP can enhance the cytokine secretion from airway epithelial cells [23] and can up\u2010regulate the expression of adhesion molecules like ICAM\u20101 on bronchial epithelial cells [52], and this process is dependent on p38 mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) activation pathways [52, 53]. In the present study, mite antigen up\u2010regulated the production of IL\u20106, IL\u20108 and GM\u2010CSF from NEC but this was not further up\u2010regulated with addition of DEP. Although the precise mechanism by which it up\u2010regulates the expression of HLA\u2010DR or CD86 is not yet known, similar mechanisms may probably regulate the expression of these molecules. One of the possible mechanisms may be via the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in cytosol [54]. More recently, using TLR\u20104 point mutant mice, Inoue et al. [55] demonstrated that DEP exposure significantly induced the lung expression of IL\u20101\u03b2, keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)\u20101\u03b1 when compared with vehicle challenge. In the presence of DEP, the levels of IL\u20101\u03b2, KC and fibrinogen were up\u2010regulated. These researchers suggest that TLR\u20104 is one of the recognition receptors against DEP in the airways. In fact, NEC express TLR\u20104 and its expression is up\u2010regulated in patients with PAR (unpublished observations). Furthermore, recently, DEP has been shown to induce antigen\u2010independent dendritic cell maturation (phenotypic or functional) via epithelial cell\u2013dendritic cell interactions mediated by epithelial cell derived GM\u2010CSF [56]. On the other hand, DEP can enhance peripheral blood T cell activation directly in severe asthmatics [57]. However, the precise immunological mechanisms by which DEP enhance allergic sensitization and inflammation are not yet well defined.",
