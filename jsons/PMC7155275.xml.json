Facility-based studies in Ethiopia indicated that the proportion of neonatal deaths was 14.3% in Gondar and 23.3% in Addis Ababa [13, 14]. Despite multiple efforts by both the government and other stakeholders, neonatal death remains higher in Ethiopia than in many developing countries [10]. Although the country is committed to achieving SDGs related to both maternal and child health, which was reflected in the Health sector development program IV and the Health sector transformation program, the benefit has not been achieved to date through a reduction in neonatal deaths. The Minister of Health is working collaboratively with the World Health Organization (WHO) to improve the quality of Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) in health facilities; however, more is needed [14, 15].",

Accordingly, the proportion of neonatal deaths was 20% (95% CI: 16.7\u201323.8%). This resulted mainly from preventable causes, which are unconscionable in the twenty-first century. The present finding is in agreement with studies conducted in Ethiopia and other developing countries such as India (18.69%), Eastern Nepal (20.2%), Nigeria (18.8%), and Central Ethiopia (23.3%) [16, 19\u201321]. However, it was greater than the studies carried out in Northern Vietnam (13.9%), India (7.16%), Ghana (16%), South Africa (13.8%), and Cameroon (15.7%) [5, 22\u201325]. These variations between studies might be explained, in part, by the discrepancy in the follow-up time, sample size, and quality of prenatal care delivered in these facilities. Also, the present study was conducted in hospitals with a recently established NICU; this might result in a difference in the distribution of essential equipment and skilled manpower. Additionally, disparities in socioeconomic conditions of the population well as geographical locations could have contributed to the variation.",

In particular, we strongly believe that achieving high-quality intrapartum and postnatal care is required to improve neonatal health. A significant proportion of neonatal deaths can be avoided by appropriate resuscitation care [40, 41]. Most of the infection-related deaths can be avoided by treating maternal infections during pregnancy, ensuring a clean birth, care of the umbilical cord, and exclusive breastfeeding [42, 43]. There is a range of available evidence-based interventions that can improve the survival of premature and low-birth-weight newborns. The promotion of early and exclusive breastfeeding, prevention, and treatment of hypothermia, including kangaroo mother care [43, 44], and topical skin-cleansing with chlorhexidine may reduce morbidity and mortality secondary to infection [45, 46]. The gap for the care of mothers and babies in the first few days of life is important even when women deliver in facilities. Moreover, communities and decision-makers need to be informed that neonatal deaths are a huge portion of child deaths, and need therefore to receive adequate attention.",

In addition, it was carried out without sampling; therefore, the possibility of sampling error was eliminated. However, the relatively small sample size and wide CI in the multivariable model associated with some variables may undermine the strength of this study. The study was conducted at hospitals; therefore, neonates delivered at home and died at home could be missed. Hence, this study does not reflect population-based neonatal mortality rather; it reflects institution-based neonatal death in the given period.",

The common causes of neonatal death were preterm birth, birth asphyxia, infection, respiratory morbidity, and congenital malformation. Preterm births, low birth weight, low 5 min. APGAR score, short stay in the NICU, failure to initiate early breastfeeding, and temperature (\u226537.5 \u00b0C) at admission were significant predictors of neonatal mortality in eastern Ethiopia. Efforts to address birth asphyxia, neonatal infections, and preterm birth are critical to achieving survival goals in newborns. Improving the timing and quality of ANC is essential for early detection, anticipating high-risk newborns, and timely interventions. Furthermore, early initiation of feeding and a better referral linkage to tertiary facilities could contribute to the reduction of neonatal mortality and morbidity in this setting.",
