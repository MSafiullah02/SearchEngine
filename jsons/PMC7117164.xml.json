            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is a member of the Alphacoronavirus genus within the family Coronaviridae. Infection of swine by this virus causes disease characterized by diarrhoea and vomiting which can lead to severe dehydration and results in high (90\u2013100%) mortality in newborn piglets (Stevenson et al., 2013). Older animals (\u226514 days) normally recover from the infection and seroconvert against the virus. The disease was initially identified within the United Kingdom (UK) in 1971 and the detection of the aetiological agent, PEDV, was first achieved in Belgium (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978); afterwards the virus spread within Europe and also to Asia (reviewed in Jung and Saif, 2015, Lee, 2015). In 2013, outbreaks of the disease occurred for the first time in the USA (Huang et al., 2013, Chen et al., 2014) and rapidly spread within both North and South America. About 7 million piglets died in a single year as a result of the outbreaks in the USA alone (Jung and Saif, 2015, Lee, 2015).",

            "text": "The genome of PEDV, like other coronaviruses, is a single-stranded positive sense RNA of about 28 kb. The virus produces a number of sub-genomic mRNAs which encode the various structural and non-structural proteins within infected cells. The virus particles include the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) protein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Brian and Baric, 2005). The spike protein is exposed on the virus surface and gives the virus particles their characteristic morphology. A number of different variants of PEDV are known (see Huang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014, Lee, 2015). The early European viruses are represented by the CV777 strain (these are sometimes classified, on the basis of the S gene sequence, as being within genogroup 1a) while two different variants of PEDV (classified, on the same basis, within genogroups 1b and 2b) have been identified within the USA. The US PEDVs are also referred to as \u201cINDEL\u201d (e.g. OH 851, from the genogroup 1b) and \u201cnon-INDEL\u201d (e.g. MN, 1A1 and 1A2 strains from 2013, in genogroup 2b); these differ by the presence of certain deletions and insertions within the S gene sequence (Huang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014, Lee, 2015).",

The PEDV can be identified by RT-PCR (e.g. Kim et al., 2007, Chen et al., 2014) in faecal or intestinal samples from acutely infected animals and a low level of viremia has also been observed in serum from acutely infected pigs (Jung et al., 2014, Jung et al., 2015, Lohse et al., 2016). However, the virus is only present in infected animals for a limited period (typically less than 1 month, see Lee, 2015) while the serological response can be expected to be much longer lasting (Crawford et al., 2015).",

More recently, following the disease outbreaks in the USA, additional Danish sera (2400 samples in 2014 and 3960 samples in 2015) were also tested and, again, all gave negative results. It is important to ensure that national diagnostic laboratories are able to detect PEDV infection efficiently when outbreaks of disease occur. For PEDV-free countries, like Denmark, Sweden and UK, or when planning to export animals from PEDV negative herds it is also important to be able to declare freedom from disease. Therefore, assays with both high sensitivity and high specificity are needed. Different laboratories use a variety of \u201cin-house\u201d assays; in addition, commercial tests for the detection of antibodies to PEDV are available. However, the properties of these different tests have not been analysed, in parallel, previously. An assessment of a range of tests, performed in different reference laboratories from Denmark (DK), Italy (IT), France (FR), The Netherlands (NL), Sweden (SE) and the UK using shared panels of porcine sera, collected from animals in the field and from experimental infection studies, has now been undertaken and the results of these analyses are presented.",

Briefly, Vero cells were infected with the Br1/87 strain of PEDV and after 24\u201348 h, when CPE was apparent, the cells (and medium) were frozen.

The virus antigen was harvested from the supernatant by further centrifugation (30000 \u00d7 \ng for 4 h) and resuspended in PBS (1/100th of initial volume). The antigen was coated (typically at 1:1000 dilution but titrated for each batch) onto 96-well ELISA plates, washed and then stored frozen until use. Sera (diluted 1:10) were added to the wells and incubated overnight at 20 \u00b0C, prior to further incubation for 1 h with a biotin-conjugated pig anti-PEDV polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:100 in 10% normal pig serum) prepared essentially as described previously (S\u00f8rensen et al., 1997). Following washing, the bound biotinylated-antibody was detected using avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (eBioscience, diluted as recommended by manufacturer) plus 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032- tetramethylbenzidine substrate and the OD was measured at 450/630 nm.

Sera from animals infected with both the early European strains of PEDV and the recent INDEL US strain (from DK experimental studies and field sera from the US and Canada) were scored as positive, except for one serum (GVB/04) from a pig experimentally infected with the CV777 strain, but the 6 others were correctly identified.

The ELISA 4 did not detect antibodies in any of the pre-diluted sera from experimentally infected pigs. Sera from 7 pigs infected with the recent US strain of PEDV were successfully detected as positive (in 19 out 21 tests using this assay).

The 10 selected French field sera, collected from herds without clinical signs of PED, included 9 samples that had unexpectedly scored positive in this test during initial testing in one of the laboratories.

Overall, it is apparent that, on a \u201cherd-basis\u201d, each of the assays is able to successfully detect infection by both the old European strains and also by the two, more recent, strains (non-INDEL and INDEL) that have infected herds within the USA in 2013/2014. The INDEL PEDV strain has also occurred in a number of European countries in 2014 and 2015. However, there can be significant differences in the detection of antibodies in individual animals by the different serological assays, and so it is clearly necessary to test several animals from a herd to ensure that successful detection of an infection of the herd is achieved. This should not be a problem since it can be considered best practice to test a representative sample and it is known that the virus spreads rapidly through an infected herd.",

For this purpose, it is particularly important that the assays demonstrate high specificity; otherwise \u201cfalse-positive\u201d reactions can require a lot of work to prove freedom from PED. It appears that the commercial ELISA 4 produces some false positive results. In Table 5, it is shown that 2 out of 40 sera from uninfected herds scored positive. These sera scored negative in both the ELISA 1 and ELISA 3 \u201cin house\u201d assays. Similarly, a group of 10 sera from France were selected for testing in the ring trial on the basis of unexpected positive reactions in the ELISA 4 (Table 1A, 1B) since they were all collected from herds with no clinical signs of PED. These samples all tested negative in the ELISA 1. These were collected at the beginning of 2014 prior to the introduction of the OH 851- related (INDEL) PEDV into France that was first detected in December 2014. Some of these sera also tested positive in other assays (ELISAs 2 and 3) and thus it may be that the pigs have been infected with another agent that cross-reacts, to some degree, in these assays. It should be noted that the ELISA 4 detects antibodies to the PEDV nucleoprotein only whereas the other assays are based on the use of whole virus preparations.",

The ELISA 1 appears to have the highest analytical sensitivity since it was the only one capable of detecting a positive reaction using pre-diluted serum samples (Table 1A, 1B). However, it was found that the antibody response to the experimental infection with the US PEDV did not induce a very strong antibody response, as determined by ELISA 1, and indeed the overall result was inconclusive in 1 of the 2 infected animals tested. For the sera from the experimentally infected pigs, it was possible, using this ELISA, to follow the generation of the immune response throughout the course of 28 days post-infection and it is clear that seroconversion did occur in each of the US PEDV inoculated pigs (see Lohse et al., 2016). The ELISA 2 and ELISA 3 also had difficulty in detecting the immune response in the animals experimentally infected with the US PEDV (see Table 2). The ELISA 4 was better in this respect (see Table 2). In contrast to these results, using field sera, there was a very high degree of agreement between the ELISA 1 and ELISA 3 (see Tables 3\u20135) and 39 of 40 sera from the OH 851-related PEDV-infected herd in Italy all scored positive in both of these tests (Table 4) while 40 sera from uninfected herds, also in Italy, were all negative in both assays.",
