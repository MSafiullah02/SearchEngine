The aim of this study was to evaluate the nicorandil's effects on ischemia-reperfusion (IR) lung injury and examine the mechanism of its effects. Methods Isolated rat lungs were divided into 6 groups. In the sham group, the lungs were perfused and ventilated for 150 min. In the IR group, after perfusion and ventilation for 30 min, they were interrupted (ischemia) for 60 min, and then resumed for 60 min. In the nicorandil (N) + IR group, nicorandil 6 mg was added before ischemia (nicorandil concentration was 75 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ). In the glibenclamide + N + IR group, the L-NAME (N \u03c9 -Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester) + N + IR group and ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one) + N + IR group, glibenclamide 3 \u00b5M, L-NAME 100 \u00b5M, and ODQ 30 \u00b5M were added 5 min before nicorandil administration, respectively. We measured the coefficient of filtration (Kfc) of the lungs, total pulmonary vascular resistance, and the wet-to-dry lung weight ratio (WW/DW ratio). Results Kfc was significantly increased after 60 min reperfusion compared with baseline in the IR group, but no change in the sham group. An increase in Kfc was inhibited in the N + IR group compared with the IR group (0.92 \u00b1 0.28 vs. 2.82 \u00b1 0.68 m l min \u22121 mmHg \u22121 100 g \u22121 ; P < 0.01). Also, nicorandil attenuated WW/DW ratio was compared with IR group (8.3 \u00b1 0.41 vs. 10.9 \u00b1 2.5; P < 0.05). Nicorandil's inhibitory effect was blocked by glibenclamide and ODQ (P < 0.01), but not by L-NAME. Conclusions Nicorandil attenuated IR injury in isolated rat lungs. This protective effect appears to involve its activation as K ATP channel opener as well as that of the sGC-cGMP pathway.",

First, male Sprague-Dawley rats ranging in weight from 300-350 g were anesthetized intraperitoneally with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). Following local anesthesia with 1.0% lidocaine, tracheostomy and sternotomy were performed, and the lungs were mechanically ventilated using a ventilator (Ugo Basile Muromachi Kikai Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with room air at a rate of 50 breaths/min, a tidal volume of 2.5 ml, and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 2 cmH 2 O. Following a median sternotomy, heparin (200 U) was injected into the right ventricle and allowed to circulate for approximately 3 min. Next, the pulmonary artery (PA) was cannulated through the right ventricle, and the snare around the PA was tightened to isolate the lung inflow. Similarly, the left atrium (LA) was cannulated though the left ventricle and tightened. Next, the lungs were ventilated with the same gas mixture of 21% O 2 , 5% CO 2 , and balanced nitrogen, and then perfused with a bicarbonate-buffered physiological salt solution containing 119 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.17 mM MgSO 4 , 22.6 mM NaHCO 3 , 1.18 mM KH 2 PO 4 , and 3.2 mM CaCl 2 . We then added 100 mg dextrose, 20 mU insulin, and 5 g bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) to each 100 ml of this stock solution. The perfusate pH was adjusted to 7.35-7.45 through the addition of sodium bicarbonate. Next, to monitor weight changes, the heart and lungs were removed en bloc and placed on an electronic balance (GX-400; A and D, Tokyo, Japan) in a humidified chamber with a set temperature of 37 \u00baC (Fig. 1) . We then discarded the first 50 ml of perfusate, which contained large amounts of residual blood cells and plasma, and used 80 ml of perfusate for recirculation.",

The measurement of Kfc in isolated lungs has been described in detail [6, 7] . During ventilation and lung perfusion, the venous and arterial reservoirs were rapidly elevated by 6 cmH 2 O for 7 min, and the gain in lung weight, which consisted of two phases-rapid weight gain owing to changes in blood volume, and a slower, more prolonged phase of weight gain owing to transcapillary filtration-was recorded. Next, the logarithm of the rate of lung weight gain (\u2206W/\u2206t) was plotted as a function of time. The \u2206W/\u2206t was then analyzed during a 3-to 6-min interval of elevated reservoirs. The initial rate of fluid filtration [(\u2206W/\u2206t)t = 0] was calculated by extrapolating \u2206W/\u2206t at time 0. Finally, we calculated Kfc by dividing \u2206W/\u2206t at time 0 [(\u2206W/\u2206t) t = 0] by changes in pulmonary capillary pressure (Ppc), and normalized using the baseline lung wet weight (WW) and expressed in ml min \u22121 mmHg \u22121 100 g \u22121 lung tissue.",

Meanwhile, functional vascular impairment from exposure to IR in the rat lung is likely to be restricted to the endothelial cell layer by the inhibition of the pulmonary vasodilator response to endothelium-dependent pulmonary vasodilators such as histamine and acetylcholine [9] . However, IR has been shown not to affect the response to sodium nitroprusside, an endothelium-independent pulmonary vasodilator [9] . These findings suggest that functional pulmonary vascular injury stemming from exposure to IR seems is restricted to the endothelial cell layer.",

The activation of K ATP channels in the lung by administration of cromakalim could help protect against and even reverse the endothelial damage associated with reperfusion injury after ischemia [8] .

Since ODQ has been demonstrated to exert no effect on Kfc with and without IR in the rat lung [11] , nicorandil also seems to exert salutary effects on IR lung injury through increasing intracellular cGMP by activating sGC as another mechanism [3] . Based on these considerations, the beneficial effects of nicorandil could be due the activation of the sGC-cGMP pathway. Indeed, nicorandil, because of its chemical structure, is considered a nitrate generator and a NO donor. Since sGC is a NO receptor, several reports have shown that NO donors reduced IR injury through activating sGC [12, 13] . During IR injury, endogenous NO and cGMP levels in tissues or organs were rapidly reduced [14] . In fact, the administration of NO to non-heart beating rat lungs during warm IR was associated with reduced IR injury and increased cGMP levels [13] . IRinduced pulmonary microvascular leak, which requires the activation of sGC, was also attenuated by inhaled NO [11] . Therefore, in the present study, the administration of nicorandil may have increased cGMP levels by the activation of sGC.",

Blood components, especially neutrophils, play an important rule on IR injury. The interaction between neutrophils and endothelial cells releases various proteases and causes cell injury. To exclude these effects and examine nicorandil's effects on endothelial cells, we used bicarbonate-buffered physiologic salt solution. Second, we did not measure NO generation. Therefore, whether NO generation was involved in the mechanism of nicorandil's protective effect in our present study remains unclear. However, using ozone chemiluminescence detection methods, nicorandil has been shown not to generate NO [15] . Hence, the administration of nicorandil is likely to increase cGMP because of the direct activation of sGC. Third, the dose of nicorandil used in the present study was higher than the clinical dosage. Yamashita et al. used about tenfold of the clinical nicorandil dose and demonstrated that nicorandil ameliorated the IR injury of a lung allograft in a canine lung transplantation model [5] . In addition, Furuya et al. [17] . demonstrated that 300 \u00b5M of nicorandil improved postischemic cardiac function in a rat heart-lung reperfusion model [16] . It is, therefore, possible that rats are less sensible than humans to K ATP channels.",
