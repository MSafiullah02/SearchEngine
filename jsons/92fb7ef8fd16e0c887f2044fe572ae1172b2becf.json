The balance between oxidants and antioxidants is necessary for the normal homeostasis of cells and organisms. Experimental works demonstrate the role of oxidative stress that is caused by influenza virus as well as the toxic effects of some antiviral drugs. Therefore, antiviral drugs should be characterized by its pro-and antioxidant activity, because it can affect its therapeutic efficiency. The aim of the study was to quantify the antioxidant capacity and propose the mechanism of the antioxidant effect of the antiviral drug Umifenovir (Arbidol \u00ae ). The kinetic chemiluminescence with the 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride + luminol system was used to quantify the antioxidant capacity of Umifenovir relative to the standard compound Trolox. With computer simulation, the reaction scheme and rate constants were proposed. The antioxidant capacity of 0.9 \u00b5M Umifenovir (maximum concentration of Umifenovir in blood after oral administration of 200 mg) was as high as 1.65 \u00b1 0.18 \u00b5M of Trolox. Thus, the total antioxidant capacity of Umifenovir is comparable to the antioxidant capacity of Trolox. Unlike Trolox, Umifenovir reacts with free radicals in two stages. For Trolox, the free radical scavenging rate constant was k = 2000 nM \u22121 min. \u22121 , for Umifenovir k 1 = 300 nM \u22121 min. \u22121 , k 2 = 4 nM \u22121 min. \u22121 . Slower kinetics of Umifenovir provides the prolonged antioxidant effect when compared to Trolox. This phenomenon can make a serious contribution to the compensation of oxidative stress that is caused by a viral disease and the therapeutic effect of the drug.",

The balance between prooxidants and antioxidants is necessary for the normal homeostasis of cells and organisms. Oxidative stress plays an important role in many pathological processes, including viral infections, such as influenza [1] . Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause oxidative damage of lipid membranes and mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mitochondria act as a platform for antiviral innate immunity. Mitochondrial antiviral signaling involves the activation of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors, which requires oxidative phosphorylation activity. The cells with respiratory defects exhibited severely impaired virus-induced induction of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines. Mice with respiratory chain defects were highly susceptible to viral infection and exhibited significant lung inflammation [2] . Oxidative and nitrosative stress may also contribute to reduced All 18 clinical isolates of influenza A viruses that were obtained before and during therapy were susceptible to Umifenovir with 50% effective concentration ranging from 8.4 +/\u2212 1.1 to 17.4 +/\u2212 5.4 \u00b5M without the development of drug-resistant variants [22] . Experimental studies at concentrations of 25-100 mg/mL proved the direct antiviral activity of Umifenovir on the early viral replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in the cultured GMK-AH-1 cells [23] .",

The clinical trials of Umifenovir were performed in the former USSR during 1980-1995 and post-marketing phase IV trial in 2011-2017 influenza seasons. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study ARBITR (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01651663) investigating the efficacy and safety of Arbidol among 359 adults that was carried out in Russia, Umifenovir (800 mg daily for five days) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the duration of fever (68 h in Umifenovir group and 75.3 in placebo group), muscle pain (52.2 vs 59.1), and weakness (76.9 vs 88.9) in Umifenovir-treated group when compared to control untreated patients, and reduced the risk of complications, namely influenza with low respiratory tract infections (0% vs 3.36%) [24] . Post-marketing surveillance of the efficiently of Umifenovir in clinical use was made by retrospective analyzed of 5287 patients with influenza and other ARVI in 88 hospitals from 50 regions of the Russian Federation. In patients that were treated with Umifenovir (in the first 48 h after disease onset), the duration of fever and frequency of pneumonia proved to be lower than those in the patients who did not receive antiviral therapy. Umifenovir therapy substantially reduces the duration of fever and risk of complications, especially in patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection [25] .",

Previously, the antioxidant effect of Umifenovir to prevent lipid peroxidation was studied in vitro [30] . The authors proved this substance to be a lipid antioxidant. However, lipid peroxidation does not restrict oxidative stress. The assessment of antioxidant potential in relation to ROS-reactions in the aqueous phase is no less important, because non-lipid ROS may cause oxidative modification of proteins and DNA. More studies are needed to characterize comprehensively the antioxidant properties of Umifenovir. ",

Depending on the k In value and the chemiluminescence system used, all of the antioxidants can be classified as strong, medium, and weak (Figure 6a ). Strong antioxidants are characterized by high rate constants and quench the chemiluminescence sharply and completely for a fixed time interval, which is referred to a \"latent period\".

Weak antioxidants with low rate constants (for example, k In = 10 nM \u22121 min \u22121 in Figure 6a ) do not give the latent period. Instead, the luminescence decreases slightly. The effect of weak antioxidants is prolonged, as they react very slowly.

For 0.9 \u00b5M of Umifenovir, which corresponds to the maximal concentration in blood after oral administration of 200 mg, the Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity was as high as 1.65 \u00b5M. Hence, from the thermodynamic point of view, Umifenovir is a more effective antioxidant than Trolox in 1.65/0.9 = 1.8 times.

Using a chemiluminescence system consisting of phospholipid liposomes, FeSO 4 , and coumarin C 525 in Tris buffer solution, they determined the antioxidant effect of Umifenovir on lipid peroxidation as a concentration of 50% depression (C50%) of amplitude of slow flash. This value (5 \u00b5M) was two orders of magnitude lower than C50% of \u03b1-tocopherol (0.06 \u00b5M). The authors attribute this fact to a poor solubility of Umifenovir in lipids. Note that, because of the comprehensive mechanism of lipid peroxidation, the amplitude of slow flash correlates with the antioxidant capacity in a complex way and it can only be used for semi-quantitative assessment. Measurements of the amplitude of the fast flash would be more adequate, but it was not possible with the chemiluminometer used by the authors. Based on the latent time of the slow flash, the authors proposed that the antioxidant effect of Umifenovir was due to the reaction with free radicals, but not with iron. However, these conclusions require confirmation by computer simulation, which may be the aim of the next study. In this study, we used 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride, a well-known water soluble radical initiator, which has been successfully applied as an initiator of lipid peroxidation [36] . This substance forms the aliphatic carbon-centered radical, which is transformed into more reactive peroxyl radical in the presence of oxygen. It is considered to be a good model substance for ozone and UV-B exposure [37] . ABAP, as a radical generator, offers a useful tool for studying oxidative stress in biochemical and biological models and antioxidant properties of substances due to a simple chemical mechanism of the degradation and possibility to work at the physiological temperature. However, such studies can only be performed in aqueous phase, not in lipids.",
