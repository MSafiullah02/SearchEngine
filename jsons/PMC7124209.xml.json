They occur widely among mammals, and the secretory pancreatic carboxypeptidase B (CPB) is generally taken to be the most representative member of this class of enzymes [1]. Although pancreatic CPB is responsible for the intestinal digestion of food proteins and peptides, the other basic carboxypeptidases are not digestive enzymes but have regulatory effects on the activity of biological peptides such as anaphylatoxins, enkephalins and bradykinins [1]. Since all the mammalian basic carboxypeptidases have similar enzymatic activities, they may play different roles in vivo, depending on their localization and physical properties.",

Since CPN has mainly been found in circulating blood, its most likely function seems to be to protect the organism from the action of potent vasoactive and inflammatory peptides such as kinins and/or anaphylatoxins [1], [4]. A plasma pro-CPB of hepatic origin which is structurally similar to pancreatic pro-CPB has recently been identified as a circulating protein, isolated from the blood, and found to form a non-covalent association with other plasma proteins [5], [6]. Unlike pancreatic CPB, which has a purely digestive function, plasma CPB might be involved in fibrinolysis and has been defined as a thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, or TAFI [7], [8].",

This enzyme differs from the other basic carboxypeptidases in that it has an acidic optimum pH, which is consistent with the acidic interior of the granules [16], [17]. CPH is probably involved in the removal of residual COOH-terminal arginine or lysine residues from peptidic prohormones during their processing in secretory granules [1], [18].

After extraction with 200 \u03bcl of Cl3CH, the aqueous phase was removed and filtered through Millipore filters (0.45 \u03bcm), and 15-\u03bcl samples were injected into the Vydac C18-RP column (0.4\u00d725 cm, 5 \u03bcm) and separated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min on a 10-min linear gradient from 10% to 25% acetonitrile in 0.01% TFA containing H2O. The basic CP activity was routinely determined spectrophotometrically during the purification steps with the same substrate, as previously described by Koheil and Forstner [29], and Skidgel and Erd\u00f6s [30]. One unit of CP activity was defined as 1 \u03bcmol of hippuryl-l-Arg hydrolysed per minute.",

In the microvillar membrane fractions, the activity was highest at pH 7.5, and the enzyme was still 72% active at pH 9.0, whereas the activity dropped sharply at acidic pH levels and was practically nil below pH 4.5. These findings are in agreement with those obtained on CPM from human placenta and from MDCK cells [21], [50]. Hog intestinal basic CP showed the highest level of activity at pH 5.0 with the soluble enzyme, and was still 57% active at pH 3.0, but its activity dropped sharply at basic pH levels. All these data suggested either that CPH may have been present, or that the lysosome did not remain intact during the subcellular fractionation, which would result in the soluble fractions being contaminated with lysosomal enzymes, which was apparently the case (Table 1). It was therefore concluded that the soluble CP activity showing an acidic optimum pH might be that of cathepsin B (also named lysosomal carboxypeptidase), which is not a metallocarboxypeptidase, but a cysteine proteinase [51]. This hypothesis was further confirmed upon testing the effects of some inhibitors and activators on the enzyme activity at acidic pH levels.",

This result therefore confirms the above conclusion that hog intestinal microvillar basic CP may not be bound to the membrane via a GPI tail like human placental CPM [23], but via a hydrophobic peptidic anchor.

Since the enzyme was not detected when immunoblotting was performed with a polyclonal antiserum against human placental CPM, intestinal CP can definitely be said to be a structurally distinct protein from human placental CPM-type enzyme. Since no NH2-terminal residue was detected using the Applied Biosystems Automatic Sequencer, the protein N-terminus was taken to be blocked. The amino acid composition of the two solubilized forms of CP from intestine was determined and compared with those of human CPM and CPD (Table 4\n). The two proteins separated by SDS\u2013PAGE showed similar amino acid contents, except for Asx and Glx, which suggests that the lower molecular mass form might be due to some proteolysis of the higher molecular mass form. The 200 kDa glycoprotein had roughly the same amino acid distribution as CPM and CPD, but its lysine content was not so high.

            "text": "The results of the present study show that hog intestinal mucosa contains at least a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase capable of releasing basic COOH-terminal amino acids from short peptides. The trypsin-solubilized form of CP was isolated from the hog intestine, with a specific activity of 100 nmol/min per mg using hippuryl-l-Arg as the substrate. According to its subcellular localization and optimum pH, the enzyme activity greatly resembles that of CPM in the human placenta as well as that of MDCK cells [21], [50]. The basic CP activity was equally distributed between the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, in agreement with the pattern of distribution of CPH in the rat gastrointestinal tract [26]. However, since the methods used by the latter authors were not really specific to CPH activity [27], the enzyme involved might have been CPM, and this might explain why CPH was sometimes found in areas apparently devoid of any endocrine function in the rat gastrointestinal tract. Although we observed that the ratio between intestinal membrane-bound and soluble CP activities was the same as that between membrane-bound and soluble CPH [26], it is worth noting that two distinct enzymes with different optimum pH values and behavior towards activators and inhibitors were found to exist in hog intestine. The soluble CP activity was probably due to cathepsin B, a cysteine enzyme of lysosomal origin with several endo- and exopeptidase activities [51], [55] usually found in the gastroduodenal mucosa [56], [57]. This enzyme, which is not a metallocarboxypeptidase, was not further characterized in this study.",

Consequently, this cell-surface peptidase is probably anchored by a sequence of hydrophobic amino acid residues to the lipid bilayer. The basic carboxypeptidases present in human and hog kidney microvillar membranes are known to have the same pattern of solubilization by detergents and to resist solubilization by PI-PLC [53], whereas CPM from human placenta and that from MDCK cells are anchored via a GPI tail [23], [50]. The discovery in human placenta of a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase which was not GPI-anchored and had different characteristics from those of CPM [23] may support the idea that membrane-bound CPM is not the sole microvillar carboxypeptidase. Since Hooper and Turner [53] described the solubilization of basic CP from the rat kidney without further characterizing the enzyme, it is therefore possible that the microvillar membrane-bound carboxypeptidase is another member of the B-type carboxypeptidase family. A placental enzyme distinct from CPM was recently partially purified and denoted CPD [58], a basic carboxypeptidase which was still unknown when the present work was carried out.",

Moreover, intestinal CP cleaved lysyl bonds faster than arginyl bonds, contrary to CPM, and immunoblotting analysis provided further evidence that hog intestinal CP was different from CPM. The molecular mass of the intestinal CP (200 kDa) was not very different from that of the membrane-bound CPD (180 kDa), which was first described in the bovine pituitary gland as a CPH-like enzyme [19], [20]. CPD is a widely distributed enzyme [20], [58] which has recently been partly purified from human placental microvilli [58], indicating that CPM is not the sole microvillar carboxypeptidase of the B-type. The optimum pH of the purified intestinal CP was actually between 6.0 and 7.0, which is similar to that of human placental CPD (5.5\u20136.5).",

It is worth noting that unlike bovine CPD, the N-terminus of which was determined chemically [19], [20], no NH2-terminal residue could be detected when NH2-terminal Edman degradation was performed on the gp180 protein purified from duck liver [59].

It is therefore widely recognized that the pancreatic CPB present in the intestine in the form of a soluble enzyme contributes along with other digestive enzymes to degrading food proteins and peptides, whereas CPH in the secretory granules of neuroendocrine tissues might be involved in the maturation and sorting of peptidic hormones [60], [61]. Two other carboxypeptidases present in most mammalian tissues and organs, namely CPN, which circulates in the blood, and CPM, which is bound to the plasma membrane of several cells, play key physiological roles, consisting of regulating the activity of various peptides. These two enzymes in particular have been described as kininases [62], although their exact function has not yet been established. The function of CPD is still unknown, but the recent finding that it is located mainly in the trans-Golgi network is consistent with the idea that it is involved in the processing of a broad range of proteins that transit along the secretory pathway, playing a similar role to that of CPH in prohormone processing in the regulated secretory pathway [63]. In addition, the finding that CPD is recycled from the cell surface to the trans-Golgi network constitutes important evidence supporting the suggestion that it may act as a receptor for hepatitis B virus [63]. Another metal containing peptidase, aminopeptidase N, has been found to be a coronavirus receptor [64], [65]. The question as to whether the intestinal membrane-bound basic CP has a specific and exclusive degradative role completing that of pancreatic CPB, or is involved independently or concomitantly in the regulation of some of the active biological peptides present in the luminal secretions of the intestine, as well as in the immunological response of the intestinal mucosa to the presence of exogenous peptidic antigens, still remains to be elucidated.",
