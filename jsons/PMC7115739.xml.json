            "text": "Despite the phenomenal scientific and technological advances witnessed in all spheres of human endeavour over the last two centuries, the spectre of large scale epidemics and famines continues to loom ominously over many nations even today. And while famine in Ethiopia and Somalia in the 1980s and 1990s as well as the havoc currently wreaked in sub-Saharan Africa by HIV/AIDS may suggest that the threat of such large scale humanitarian crises is largely confined to under-developed third world regions, the outbreaks in Europe and Asia of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Avian Bird Flu strain H5N1 in 2006, and the 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic caution against such complacency. These outbreaks also warn against consigning to the past the lessons of a whole range of other episodes in modern European history, from the Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918/19 which claimed the lives of between 50 and 100 million people worldwide, to the more localized Great Irish Famine of 1845\u20131852 which led to the death of approximately 1 million Irish people from famine related diseases and the exodus of a further 1 million inhabitants, making it one of the most lethal famines in modern history in terms of excess mortality and population loss.1\nWith this in mind, we set about analysing the consequences of a large scale mortality shock arising from a famine or epidemic for long run economic growth. To facilitate this, we take the fore-mentioned Great Irish Famine of 1845\u20131852 as a case-study and utilize a recently developed school of long-run economic-demographic growth models encompassing the work of Galor and Weil, 1999, Galor and Weil, 2000, Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003a, Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003b, Lagerl\u00f6f, 2006 to simulate and analyse the impact of such a mortality shock on a country's subsequent economic development.",

Barro and Sala i Martin (1995, pp. 171\u2013198) and Azomahou et al. (2006), in particular, provide useful summaries of attempts to capture the effects of a Spanish Flu-like epidemic (one which has massive immediate effects) in both a one-sector framework and the two-sector framework of Lucas (1988). Both approaches, however, suffer from a number of shortcomings. As Azomahou et al. (2006) note, the one-sector framework where physical and human capital are substitutes seems to be less suited to this purpose as it essentially reduces the epidemic to an \u201cinitial condition shock\u201d whereby the economy returns to its steady state equilibrium after the mortality shock and one merely ends up studying the transitional dynamics. Furthermore, the role of demography in such a model plays only a minor role and does not impact the return to human capital in the short or long run. It does allow for a marked growth episode in the aftermath of the epidemic but only by virtue of the fact that the epidemic's depletion of human capital makes human capital accumulation more desirable in the post-epidemic period. The two-sector model, as per Lucas (1988), allows for a more nuanced story as it differentiates between the production of physical and capital goods and assumes that there is an education sector that is more human capital intensive than the final good sector. This set-up allows population growth to impact on human capital production through the allocation of effort devoted to the production of human capital. An external effect of human capital can also be built into this set-up. However, Azomahou et al. (2006) point out that in the post-epidemic period the economy must allocate its scarce human capital between the education and final good sectors and might find it optimal to assign more human capital to the sector less intensive in human capital \u2014 the final good sector. This is in contrast to the catching-up mechanism of the one-sector model and leads to a post-epidemic period of slow growth and high wages (due to the increased return to human capital).",

            "text": "It is in the context of these somewhat ambiguous theoretical predictions that we turn to the unified growth theory advanced by Galor and Weil (2000) in search of further insights. The Galor and Weil (2000) modelling framework captures, in a single process, Western European economic development from the period of Malthusian stagnation through to the contemporary era of modern growth, generating: (i) the oscillations in population and output per capita observed during the Malthusian period, (ii) an endogenous take-off from Malthusian stagnation to a Post-Malthusian stage that is associated with an acceleration in technological progress and is accompanied initially by a rapid increase in population growth, and (iii) a rise in the demand for human capital, followed by a demographic transition and sustained economic growth.2\nA key concept for the purposes of this paper is that of industrialisation. In unified growth models industrialisation is captured through this process of technological progress, accompanied by population growth and human capital accumulation. In empirical studies, of course, industrialisation is observed through the changing industrial structure of the economy and its transition from an agrarian economy to one where manufacturing plays a dominant role. We argue that these two approaches are compatible in that they represent two different ways of representing the same stages of the development process.",

            "text": "This unified growth framework is particularly suited to modelling the Great Irish Famine by virtue of the time period in which the famine occurred: the period 1845\u20131852 is one where Ireland could be considered to have been on the cusp of industrialisation, as indicated by its changing industry structure. Geary (1998) finds that the structure of Irish pre-famine employment was consistent with Ireland's position on the path of development as exhibited either by an average for continental Europe or Britain at a similar level of income. Almquist (1979) considers Irish pre-famine development in terms of \u201cproto-industrialisation\u201d theory, which proposes that a major expansion of rural industry, primarily in textiles (domestic spinning and weaving), formed a phase precursory to industrialisation in many European regions.3\nGiven that Ireland could be seen as being on the cusp of industrialisation prior to the famine, the choice of a unified growth model seems appropriate since in this type of model the process of industrialisation itself is hypothesized to be greatly influenced by the impact of epidemics and large scale mortality shocks.",

Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003a, Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003b models the transition from the Malthusian, through the Post-Malthusian, and on to the Modern Growth stage endogenously, using the stochastic occurrence of a series of unusually soft epidemic shocks as the mechanism through which this transition is brought about. This model serves as a useful analytical tool in our case, since mortality shocks can be expected to exert a large influence on the subsequent economic development. The set-up offers us the opportunity to consider the impact of an exogenous mortality shock of unusually large magnitude, such as the Irish Famine, in the context of a country's entire economic and demographic development process. In this way, the Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003a, Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003b approach helps us to disentangle the demographic and economic effects of epidemics and famines, place such effects in the multiple equilibrium setting of industrialisation brought about by human capital accumulation, and characterize epidemics and famines as having long run impacts through emigration and demographic channels rather than being short, sharp shocks.",

Despite being unsuited to storage or transportation, the potato's high nutritional content, relatively dependable yield even in poor soil during the pre-famine years, and its flexibility as a food for both man and livestock led to an over-dependence on the crop, particularly among the poorer layers of Irish society. By 1845, according to \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da (1993), the potato's share in tilled acreage was little short of one-third and about three million people were largely dependent on it for food. As Kinealy (2006, p. xvi) notes, \u201cthe Great Irish Famine remains unsurpassed, in relative terms, in terms of demographic decline with the Irish population falling by approximately 25% in just six years, due to a combination of excess mortality and emigration\u201d. While the diseased potato crop may have triggered the Great Famine, it was a complex web of economic, political, and social issues that exacerbated the situation and ultimately contributed to the shocking level of distress witnessed during the famine years.",

This fact, as well as Ireland's quasi-colonial de facto political status impeded integration with Britain.5\nThat said, Ireland enjoyed an important trading relationship with Britain, exporting enough corn to feed two million people on the eve of the famine. If over-dependence on one crop, as well as the Irish practice of subdivision of land were instrumental in creating the conditions in which the famine, once ignited, could rampage, attitudes towards Ireland emanating from British political circles also played a part. Kinealy (2002) notes that official reports into the condition of Ireland confirmed that the Westminster government was anxious to modernize Ireland in order to end Irish dependency on British resources. In light of this, the Great Famine presented the Westminster government with the social dislocation necessary to replace both poor tenants and impoverished landlords with a new class of commercial farmers, with a crucial element of this approach being the minimal intervention by the Westminster government despite the extent of the famine afflicting Ireland. Consequently, what relief was provided was nowhere near sufficient to cope with the sheer scale of the famine over the 1845\u20131848 period.6\n",

Turning to post-famine estimates, Geary and Stark (2002), using sectoral wage and labour force data to construct estimates of Irish and British GDP for the period 1861 to 1911, estimate that Ireland's GDP per capita growth clocked in at an average of 0.9% per annum over the period 1871\u20131911, with GDP per worker averaging at 1.1% over the same period. The corresponding figures for Great Britain are 0.8%, both in per capita and per worker terms. These positive developments are supported by \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da (1994, p242) who notes that Irish national income per capita almost trebled between 1845 and 1914; and rose from 40% to 57% of the British level between 1845 and World War 1. The Irish post-famine performance has even been hailed by O'Rourke (1995) as the \u201cIrish Miracle\u201d and points to increased post-famine emigration as being crucial in facilitating this economic revival.",

As per Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003a, Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003b, we start by considering a single economy, but we modify the set-up so that the inhabitants can leave, i.e. emigrate, for good without returning or having any further interaction with the economy. The significance of this explicit modelling of emigration is that it recognises the crucial role that emigration plays in shaping both demographic and economic trends long after the occurrence of a mortality shock which is not global in scale. The inhabitants', or agents', lives have two stages: childhood and adulthood. In our version of the model, however, surviving children either become adults in their single economy or they emigrate. In this way the emigration decision in this model is made once, before adulthood, and emigration is similar to a leakage from the single economy.15\nThe emigrants do not return to their home country (a reasonable assumption for Irish\u2013US emigration in the 1800s and well into the 1900s, but perhaps less so for Irish\u2013British emigration) and we do not consider remittances from the host country as we assume such remittances would be too small and sporadic to influence the GDP of the source country. We do address the issue of previous waves of emigrants enticing new emigrants to join them in the host country (the \u201cfriends and relatives effect\u201d) by positing that the emigration decision is influenced by the stock of emigrants from previous years.16\nThis very simple portrayal of emigration may seem unrealistic at first, but less so if one believes that people emigrate at a young age and, more crucially, that these young emigrants do not remain in Ireland long enough to have children.",

However, an assumption of constant labour productivity is at odds with what has been empirically observed in post-famine Ireland: for example, Geary and Stark (2002) estimate that between 1861 and 1911 Irish labour productivity grew at 0.9% per year and that between 17% and 28% of Irish labour productivity gains were due to labour force declines arising from emigration, with the combined effects of capital accumulation and total factor productivity (TFP) accounting for the rest. The results of Geary and Stark (2002) are derived assuming a neoclassical economy with constant returns to scale Cobb\u2013Douglas production. In the neoclassical framework, a fall in the labour force with a constant capital stock leads to an increase in GDP per capita. This phenomenon has also been observed in the aftermath of the Black Death, where a population decline that exceeded the fall in output led to an increase in output per capita; Pamuk (2007). In light of this, it is desirable that our modelling set-up allows labour productivity to vary over time.18\nThis inclusion of a time-varying labour productivity term enables us to incorporate into our set-up a post-famine economic recovery brought about by labour force outflows or efficiency gains. We set up a simple dynamic function, Eq. (2) below, where labour productivity per person increases linearly over time and is non-decreasing. We allow labour productivity per person, D\nt, to be time-varying by linking it to emigration. The emigration flow in each period, E\nt, is then presented in Eq. (7) below. This simplified approach is intended to operationalize our time-varying labour productivity term, rather than fully characterizing the process through which the labour productivity is generated.",

(2) is that, while emigration is posited to affect labour productivity positively, the negative impact of \u201cbrain drain\u201d due to the emigration of skilled workers is overlooked. While we would advocate the inclusion of a term capturing \u201cbrain drain\u201d, in the Irish post-Famine case the influence this phenomenon is far from clear. \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da (1994) notes that is reasonable to assume that, though most of those who emigrated after the Famine were described as \u201clabourers\u201d or \u201cservants\u201d in both emigration returns and passenger lists, there was probably some selection bias towards the most talented. However, \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da (1994) also points out that skilled workers were relatively well paid in Ireland in nineteenth century Ireland. A wage survey conducted by the Fiscal Inquiry Committee in 1923 indicated that by 1914 skilled workers in Ireland were paid almost as much as their British peers.19\nAs our specification (2) represents a first pass at embedding dynamic labour productivity and emigration tinto the Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003a, Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003b setting, we opt for a simple, yet reasonable, specification and leave refinements to future research.",

However, as Whelan (1999) notes, Ireland's post famine demographic experience was not normal: the persistent decline in Irish post-famine population occurred despite the Irish post-famine birth rate being unremarkable by European standards, albeit due to an unusual combination of large families and low marriage rates (Guinnane, 1997). It was continued emigration flows rather than low birth rate growth that principally caused this persistent depopulation.",

However, these \u201cpush factor\u201d explanations may only capture one side of story, as post-Famine Ireland did not experience decline in living standards (outlined in Section 2.1 above). It may have been the case that \u201cpull factors\u201d of growing demand for labour in USA and Britain. \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da (1994) suggests that during the famine emigrants were not concerned about the trends in living standards abroad, but were motivated by the \u201cpush factor\u201d of domestic levels of distress. The forced nature of famine era migration is evident from \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da and O'Rourke (1997):\u201cthe emigrants of this year are not like the former ones; they are now actually running away from fever, disease and hunger, with money scarcely sufficient to pay passage for and find food for the voyage\u201d. Forced migration such as that witnessed in the famine era has been a prominent feature in development studies, where it emerges as a result of environmental, economic or demographic crises [(de Haan, 1999, Ahmed, 2009]. After the famine, \u201cpull factors\u201d must have dominated, since emigration persisted despite slowly improving conditions at home. \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da (1994) points out that that between the mid-1850 s and 1910 the American real wage rose by two-thirds or more, while the emigration rate from Ireland fell from about 12 to 6 per thousand.",

Two of the other drivers of migration, however, are easier to embed into our model: the \u201cfriends and relatives effect\u201d of those who emigrated in previous years is represented by lagged emigration data, while we use the exogenous mortality shock to capture the demographic forces unleashed by the level of distress experienced in pre- and post-famine Ireland.20\nThis series of exogenous random mortality shocks, presented in Eqs.

In this way, our simulations better reflect our Irish case-study. In order to assign a suitable value to \u03b6, we revert to the original Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003a, Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003b model, where FCt\u22121=F=1, Dt=D=1 and emigration is excluded.

The resulting value of this parameter is reported in Table 1. Next, we turn to the calibration of the parameters of the emigration function (7). Given the value of \u03b6, observations on the level of emigration and a chosen set of shocks \u03c9\nRt a value of \u03ba can be estimated during a period within the Malthusian era.27\nThe value of \u03ba derived from this calibration is presented in Table 1.

The value \u03b3\n = 0.05 gives reasonable results. In order to calibrate the remaining parameters, we first must choose a value for the exogenous mortality shock, \u03c9\nF , such that the observed Irish population decline (illustrated in Section 2) between years 1850 and 1875 is well captured by the model. A suitable approximation for this demographic decline is achieved by ensuring that the 1875 population level is about 70 % of the 1850 level \u2014 a requirement that fits neatly with the 25 year time steps of the model.

As discussed in Section 3, we base our calibration of \u03be on the findings of Geary and Stark (2002), who provide some very compelling empirical evidence relating to Irish post famine growth. With regard to the phenomenon of Irish post famine convergence in output per capita with Great Britain prior to World War 1, they use 1861 and 1911 data to disaggregate the observed Irish labour productivity gains of this period and identify the contribution of labour force changes and Total Factor Productivity (TFP). Their results indicate both labour market outflows and productivity gains were the drivers of the Irish post-famine performance, with traditional explanations based on capital accumulation and TFP growth explain the bulk of the Irish performance. Their estimates indicate that between 1861 and 1911 labour productivity grew at 0.9% per year, and that between 17% and 28% of Irish labour productivity gains were due to labour force declines arising from emigration. We then take 23% (the middle value of this range) of the growth of labour productivity during this time period as being due to emigration, which suggests that labour productivity growth due to emigration flows was 0.23 \u204e 0.9 \u2248 0.21% per year. As our simplified labour productivity specification just uses emigration flows in order to endogenize labour productivity trends, we calibrate \u03be such that it yields an annual average growth in labour productivity of 0.21% over the 25 year time step 1850 to 1875.",

We deem this switch to industrialisation to represent the period just prior to 1850\u2013that is, we define the date of industrialisation as the first period when h\nt\n > 0. In the period starting in year 1850, we apply the exogenous mortality shock to our benchmark model, i.e. t\nF\n = 1850. This shock represents the occurrence of the 1845\u20131852 famine. This initial case is then used as a benchmark against which the impact of the famine on Irish development can be compared. We also consider the hypothetical situation for a more severe mortality shock than that experienced in Ireland over the 1845\u20131852 period. This allows us to hypothesise about the impact of a more severe mortality shock on the Irish industrialisation process, when that shock occurs on the cusp of Irish industrialisation. For this case, we choose \u03c9\nF\n \n=\n 0.041, which means that in this harsher famine case only 50% of the Irish pre-famine population level remains after the famine.30\n",

            "text": "Regarding the occurrence of Irish industrialisation, over time our benchmark model does industrialise (as illustrated by the take-off in population and GDP per capita in Fig. 4) as a sufficiently mild set of mortality shocks leads to lower mortality and rising population growth which through the scale effect on human capital production raises human capital productivity and brings about a quality-quantity switch at the point in time where education time (that adults dedicate to their children) becomes operative (i.e. h\n > 0). This, of course, is exactly what the Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003a, Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003b is designed to achieve. As outlined above, the period in which our benchmark model industrialises is then set to 1825 i.e. h\nt\n > 0. What is of particular interest to us, of course, is what happens to industrialisation, and the population and GDP per capita take-off, when an exogenous mortality shock such as that which struck Ireland in 1845\u20131852 occurs on the cusp of the industrialisation process. As illustrated by our \u201cfamine scenario\u201d in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, industrialisation in terms of h\nt is preserved during the famine period \u2014 that is, h\nt\n > 0 in 1825 and the famine shock is not severe enough to cause the Irish economy to de-industrialize in terms of this variable \u2014 and a definitive take-off does still occur but is delayed by about 75 years. The post famine population level appears to revert back to its Malthusian level within 50 years, but a definitive take-off does not occur until about 1950. One can compare these results to what has been observed in the Irish demographic trends discussed in Section 2: after the initial mortality shock the Irish population continued its decline well after 1890, falling a further 5% between 1891 and 1926 and then remaining relatively stable until the 1960 s, when it eventually began to pick up. Our model results predict a relatively swift recovery to the average Malthusian level of population. Since our model only takes into account the direct effects that the famine had on demographics, through mortality and emigration, and not the impact of the famine on fertility and nutrition, the simulated population level may be somewhat overestimated. That said, our simulation results are broadly in line with those demographic trends observed in Ireland: a substantial fall in the level of population after the famine, a recovery to the average pre-famine level and then a definitive take-off in the mid-twentieth century. Our \u201cfamine scenario\u201d GDP per capita also broadly resembles the empirics of Section 2 in that a clear take-off in Irish GDP per capita occurs post 1960. This suggests that the impact of the famine delays the GDP take-off associated with industrialisation by approximately 75 years. This \u201cfamine scenario\u201d simulation also captures the strong post-famine economic performance experienced by Ireland over the 1860\u20131913 period, as discussed in Section 2.",

            "text": "But what facilitates the recovery and subsequent demographic and economic take-off, and what determines how quickly or slowly this process occurs? We have augmented the original Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003a, Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003b to allow two channels through which the post-famine economy can recover: (i) labour productivity and (ii) human capital accumulation. In our modelling set-up, we aim to incorporate empirically observed labour productivity trends and this is achieved in our simplified labour productivity specification by using emigration flows in order to endogenize labour productivity trends. This allows us to capture in our simulations the findings of Geary and Stark (2002), whose results indicate that the strong Irish post-famine economic performance partly was driven by labour productivity growth, arising from labour market outflows and TFP growth. While labour productivity may have contributed significantly to the post-famine economic performance, our modelling set-up also affords human capital accumulation a prominent role. In the Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003a, Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003b model, industrialisation is measured by the variable h\nt, which is the time that parents spend educating their children. In our model, we augment this in Eq. (10) by assuming that GDP per capita in the previous period facilitates the transfer of education infrastructure into the next period which is inherited by the next generation of adults and used in the education of their children. Through this mechanism we assume that this period's GDP per capita contributes to the accumulation of next period's human capital. If a large mortality shock was to occur in the original Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003a, Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003b model, the resulting impact on human capital would be entirely negative: due to the fall in population density associated with large scale mortality, knowledge transfer is hampered (through Eq. (9) above) and human capital production, H in Eq. (8), declines. Our set-up, however, mitigates this fall in human capital production: due to the gain in GDP per capita brought about by rising labour productivity, post-famine human capital accumulation gets a \u201cpush\u201d which prevents the famine mortality shock from causing de-industrialisation (i.e. h\nt becoming non-operative). In this way, as the post-famine economy experiences a sudden increase in GDP per capita \u2014 be it from efficiency gains from increased emigration or through TFP gains, this raises the standards of living and helps to rebuild the level of human capital in the aftermath of the famine. This human capital recovering process turns out to have a decisive impact on the process of industrialisation, in that the economy remains industrialised (in terms of h\nt) in the aftermath of the famine mortality shock. This retention of the ability to produce human capital may provide an explanation as to why the recovery appears to occur relatively swiftly: the economy remains in an industrialised state despite the onslaught of the famine mortality shock and once the level of population returns back to the Malthusian state, h\nt can continue to drive the demographic and economic take-off which had been delayed by the famine.32\nThis characterization of human capital is in line with the findings of Crayen and Baten (2009), who report a small deterioration in Irish numeracy (a proxy for human capital) directly after the famine, with convergence back to pre-famine levels occurring around 1870. After 1870 a take-off in Irish numeracy is observed and convergence to numeracy levels of other developed North European countries is reached in the 1920s.",

It should be emphasised that Fig. A1 and 2 do not attempt to predict the observed series in levels: the data used to calibrate the model (British population data points and parameters taken from Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003a, Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003b) creates gaps between the actual and simulated series. The comparison of this take-off timing illustrates the usefulness of this class of unified growth model for the modelling of large scale mortality shocks, as well as displaying features that could be further refined in future research. Indicative of the usefulness of the model is the fact that the timing of the take-off of actual and simulated GDP per capita coincides almost exactly circa 1950. The population graph (A2) identifies a number of shortcomings of the model: (i) the size of the famine shock may be impaired due to the initial population data points used to calibrate the model (ii) the simulated population series rebounds relatively quickly after the famine shock. This reflects the fact that the number of channels through which the aftermath of the famine shock can impact population is limited in our simplistic model. A host of demographic factors, for example post-famine health, nutrition or the age and gender of emigrants, are not explicitly included in the model but may have long-run consequences for post-famine population growth. Simulated population take-off occurs circa 1925, while actual population take-off was delayed until 1960.",

Would the outcome in terms of the occurrence and timing of industrialisation have been significantly altered? As is clear from \u201csevere famine\u201d scenarios of Fig. 4, Fig. 5, industrialisation does occur in this more severe case and population and GDP per capita do still take off.33\nHowever, in our simulations this industrialisation (i.e. h\nt becoming operative) is now delayed by 250 years compared to the benchmark \u201cno famine\u201d scenario, and when compared to the case in which the famine did occur, this \u201csevere famine\u201d scenario yields a delay of a similar length of time in the eventual take-off of GDP per capital and population levels.34\nWhat can one conclude from this \u201csevere famine\u201d case? It seems that a harsher famine at the cusp of industrialisation does indeed act as a larger deterrent to industrialisation in terms of demographic and economic growth. Perhaps the most important insight to be gleaned from this \u201csevere famine\u201d scenario in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, however, is that the impact of this harsher famine could be so significant that it serves to completely de-industrialise the economy, in terms of the education time variable h\nt. The post-famine economy would then recover to its Malthusian level but remain stuck at this level for a protracted period of time until demographic and economic take-off eventually occurs (through the human capital accumulation mechanism of the model). Clearly, one could envisage that if, on the cusp of industrialisation, Ireland had been struck by a more prolonged famine than that caused the potato blight of which ruined the harvest of 1845, 1846, and 1848 or by a famine more deadly in terms of mortality and displacement, Ireland may not have been in a position to initiate its successful industrialisation in the 1960s.",

To facilitate this, we take the fore-mentioned Great Irish Famine of 1845\u20131852 as a case-study and utilize a recently developed school of long-run growth models epitomised by Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003a, Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003b. Such models are capable of endogenously generating multiple equilibria: one Malthusian growth path of stagnation in population level and living standards and one industrialised path of sustained growth in population and income per capita. The transition between these equilibria is brought about by a series of random mortality shocks. When a sequence of such shocks is sufficiently small, the survival rate of children rises, and the population level rises beyond a threshold after which a \u201cquantity-quality shift\u201d in children is generated and human capital is growing away from population.",

The timing of the shock is such that it is applied in the period right after the \u201cquality-quantity shift\u201d in children is due to take place. This ensures that the set-up is applicable to an economy that is on the cusp of industrialisation. We augment the Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003a, Lagerl\u00f6f, 2003b model in a number of ways to make it more realistic in the face of a large scale mortality shock, such as a famine. Firstly, we introduce emigration into the model and characterise it as being influenced by the level of distress endured and by the previous levels of emigration outflows. Secondly, we incorporate a labour productivity specification that is allowed to vary over time, and, finally, a scale effect which allows GDP per capita increases in one period to contribute to human capital production in the next period. We then simulate three distinct cases: (i) a benchmark model, which represents the Irish development path towards industrialisation in the absence of the famine mortality shock, (ii) a \u201cfamine scenario\u201d, where a mortality shock proportionate to that actually experienced in Ireland over the 1845\u20131852 period is modelled, and (iii) a \u201csevere famine scenario\u201d, where we hypothesise a mortality shock far more severe than that actually experienced in Ireland.",

In all, our simulations suggest that the impact of a mortality shock similar in magnitude to the Irish famine delays the GDP take-off associated with industrialisation by up to 100 years. What is more, we see that this Irish famine-sized mortality shock does not cause the Irish economy to de-industrialize \u2014 its nascent industrialisation appears to stall and the eventual economic and demographic take-off is delayed for a period of about 75 years, but the industrialisation process is not derailed entirely.",

In this way, the post-famine economy retains its ability to increase its labour productivity and human capital levels, despite the massive impact of the famine mortality shock. We also simulate the hypothetical case of the Irish economy being struck by a more severe famine shock in the 1845\u20131852 period, than that actually experienced. What emerges is the finding that a harsher famine shock could have been so severe as to completely de-industrialise the economy.

It is difficult to speculate on exact timing of industrialisation in this case, since if industrialisation was severely delayed it is likely that other factors outside the scope of our model would have come into play. Of broader application, and perhaps relevant to the economic and demographic travails of developing nations in modern times, is the following feature of our simulations: it appears that should a country on the cusp of industrialisation be stricken with a large scale mortality shock, its ability to recover from such misfortune and the speed of such a recovery may greatly depend on the extent to which that country's human capital stock, and human capital production capabilities, are damaged and whether or not the labour productivity of the remaining population is capable of being enhanced in the aftermath of such a mortality shock.",
