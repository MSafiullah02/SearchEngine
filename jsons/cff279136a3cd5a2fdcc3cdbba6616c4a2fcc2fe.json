In these situations, the wireless networks may become congested or completely disrupted and may not be adequate to support the traffic generated by rescuers. It is also considered as the key tool in Corona Virus (COVID-19) battle. Moreover, the conventional approaches with fixed gateways may not work either, and this might lead to decoding errors due to the large distance between mobile nodes and the gateway. To avoid the decoding errors and improve the reliability of the messages, we propose to use intermediate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to transfer messages from ground-based Long Range (LoRa) nodes to the remote base station (BS). Specifically, this UAV-enabled LoRa architecture is based on the ad hoc WiFi network, wherein, UAVs act as relays for the traffic generated between LoRa nodes and BS. To make the architecture more efficient, a distributed topology control algorithm is also proposed for UAVs. The algorithm is based on virtual spring forces and movement prediction technique that periodically updates the UAV topology to adapt to the movement of the ground-based LoRa nodes that move on the surface. The simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed approach for packet reception rate and average delay quality of service (QoS) metrics. It is observed that the mechanisms implemented in a UAV-enabled LoRa network effectively help to improve the packet reception rate with nominal buffer delays.",

IoT solutions are being used in the industry, in agriculture, in smart cities and in many other sectors [2, 3] .

Exclusive prerogative of the military for many years, UAVs are now commercially available and their relatively low price makes them appealing for a wide variety of applications in a diverse range of scenarios [6] [7] [8] [9] . The price range can vary between 20$-300$ for small battery-powered Radio Frequency (RF) drones such as the Parrot Bebop 2, to more than 3000$ for professional drones with advanced control systems and sensors such as the DJI Spreading Wings S1000. In the consumer market segment, drones are mainly used for taking aerial pictures and videos, while in the commercial segment the range of applications is more diverse: mapping of geographical areas, product delivery, and logistics, data collection, crop monitoring, and surveillance [10] [11] [12] . Drones are increasingly being used also in applications such as crime prevention, weather and meteorology, search and rescue operations, border and maritime patrol and forest fire monitoring. In case of a disaster, such as an earthquake, a flood or a wildfire [13] , UAVs can be used to support the operations of the rescuers, to localize the victims and to create a backhaul network in case of absence or disruption of the communication facilities [14] . In this last circumstance, the relay network formed by UAVs can support the data generated by isolated IoT devices that have been deployed in advance or during the rescue operations. During the ongoing pandemic circumstances, the UAVs can be deployed against the Corona Virus (COVID- 19) battle. Some of the important applications of UAVs against corona are virtual tours of quarantined regions, sending medical supplied to patients, hospital and areas to which the access is difficult, prevent virus spread via virtual and wireless control.",

The results show that, by using the maximum Spread Factor (SF) and a bandwidth of 125 kHz in the 868 MHz band, the signal can reach the gateway from a 15 km distance on the ground and 30 km on water, with increments of the Packet Drop Rate (PDR) proportional to the distance. The authors of [16] have performed a similar analysis in a medium-density urban area, noting in this case, that the maximum range under the same conditions described in [15] is only 5.8 km, mainly due to the presence of obstacles in the line-of-sight. Moheddine et al. in [17] proposed the concept of flying gateways for enabling communication between IoT and UAV networks. Though their work used Raspberry Pi boards, they expected to improve the performance of the network using LoRa devices.",

The authors report that at a distance of 1.2 km from the gateway the PDR is already between 60% and 90%. The authors conclude that the presence of line-of-sight is particularly important and that LoRa is not suited for indoor environments if long-range and low PDR is required. The importance of line-of-sight is also outlined by Iova et al. [19] . In this case, the experiments were conducted in a forest environment in the presence of numerous trees between the transmitter and the receiver. In the experiment, the transmitter was moved further and further away from the receiver and at around 90-100 m the signal was completely lost. The authors conclude that vegetation has a huge impact on LoRa signal propagation, in fact dropping the maximum achievable range by an order of magnitude. The use of the chirp spread spectrum, a variation of Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), makes the LoRa modulation very resilient to noise. This assumption is verified by Angrisani et al. [20] . In the experiment, different levels of white Gaussian noise are applied to the signal starting with a minimum signal-to-noise ratio of \u221210 dBm. As expected, the use of a smaller bandwidth and, more significantly, the use of a higher SF improves the performance of the modulation. The coding rate, on the other hand, has a less significant impact on the performance in noisy environments.",

The only difference is in the fact that their proposed scheme defines 8 parallel reception paths, each one of them able to lock on an incoming packet on a given frequency. Their results show considerable improvement using the developed LoRa module. Van den Abeele et al. in [22] proposed a model similar to the one previously described. The main difference resides in the way in which inter-device interference is computed. In this case, instead of using a signal-to-interference matrix, the authors performed a series of complex MATLAB baseband simulations to measure the Bit Error Rate (BER) of a set of LoRa configurations over a white Gaussian noise channel. The BER points are then used to determine the BER curve that is then used to decide if a packet is lost for interference or not.",

The swarm has also the additional requirement of keeping the connectivity to a ground base station. Two scenarios are studied by the authors: one in which the connectivity to the base station is permanent and one in which some disconnections are allowed for the purpose of extending the exploration. Di Felice et al. [24] propose a distributed approach similar to [23] , but based on VSFs. The UAV mesh network described in the paper is used to give coverage to a set of partitioned ground nodes. The least visited cell in the visibility zone is then selected for exploration and an attractive spring force is computed between the UAV and the center of the cell. Chandrashekar et al. [25] study the problem of determining the minimum number of UAVs necessary to provide full coverage to clusters of isolated ground nodes and at the same time maintain connectivity between UAVs. The position of the UAV that covers this subset of clusters (supercluster) is determined by means of a convex minimization problem. The UAV to send to the new computed location is chosen by using a metric that minimizes the total travel distance of UAVs. Caillouet et al. [26] tackle the more challenging problem of optimally positioning the minimum number of UAVs, taken from the set of all available UAVs, in order to cover a set of targets on the ground, while maintaining the connectivity of the aerial mesh to a ground base station. An evaluation of the model performed by the authors proves that the algorithm always finds an optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time (1000 s). The authors also state that the impact of the connectivity constraint more than doubles, in some circumstances, the number of deployed UAVs.",

Early attempts to assessing the scalability of LoRaWAN were performed by resorting to mathematical models. Mikhaylov et al. [31] assessed the scalability of a LoRa network in the presence of a single gateway. The authors modeled the LoRaWAN MAC as pure ALOHA and concluded that LoRaWAN can potentially scale to millions of devices in case of end devices generating only intermittent uplink traffic, but most of the devices need to be positioned very close to the gateway. The authors of [22] provided analysis for LoRaWAN. They performed simulation in ns-3 and analyzed the scalability and reliability of such networks. The authors of [32] performed measurements for received signal strength (RSS) for a LoRa network for indoor, suburban and urban environments. They concluded that for vertical transmitting antennas, the radiation pattern of UAV results in stronger RSS levels at the LoRa network.",

For instance, consider a forest in which a wildfire has been detected. Wildfires generally represent a worldwide problem, but America and Europe are the two continents where the incidence of forest fires is higher. The costs, in terms of economic losses and human deaths, are also considerable [13] . Wildfires typically affect rural or suburban areas where the network coverage of traditional communication networks (e.g., cellular networks) is scarce, intermittent or completely lacking. This situation is worsened by the huge propagation loss introduced by foliage and trees in the signal propagation path. In this situation UAVs can be used to establish a mesh network acting as a relay between the Base Station (BS) installed in the command post, the place where operations are managed, and the sensors carried by firemen, therefore providing more precise situational awareness to the rescuers. The mobility of the firefighters represents another huge challenge since the UAVs mesh network needs to adjust its position while maintaining the connectivity to the BS and to firemen on the ground. Unfortunately, the related literature on such works is still scarce, leaving many issues open to further investigation. In this work, our objective is to design and evaluate a UAV mesh network system, called UAV-enabled LoRa network. In this regard, the distinguishing aspects of our work and a brief comparison with the state-of-the-art solutions are given in Table 1 .

The main objective of the UAV-enabled LoRa system is to provide network coverage to a set of mobile GNs using a fleet of UAVs, whose purpose is to promptly relay the collected data to a base station through an ad hoc network established between its members, as shown in Figure 1 . To meet these requirements, each UAV must be able to automatically adjust its position to reflect the continuously changing topology of the GN and at the same time, it must be able to maintain a communication path with the base station. Disconnections, although difficult to avoid, must be minimized and a recovery technique must be set up to recover the connectivity whenever it is necessary. UAV-enabled LoRa network provides mechanisms to deal with all the aforementioned problems. This kind of system might be useful in a wide variety of situations, especially when there is the need to rapidly deploy a network to collect data generated by moving targets in remote or disrupted areas, where other networks might be unavailable, damaged or highly congested [38, 39] . The architecture of the UAV-enabled LoRa network consists of a two-layer system, in which the first layer is composed of GNs that transmit data using LoRaWAN and the second layer is composed of a swarm of drones communicating over a WiFi ad hoc network and acting as relays between the GNs and a BS.

The module contains also a LoRa-to-WiFi relay application, responsible for adapting uplink LoRa packets received by the gateway and send them over the WiFi ad hoc network to the intended destination. The most important and complex part of the whole system is the virtual spring force (VSF) distributed mobility algorithm.

It is considered that all UAVs fly at the same altitude in a 2D plane. A three-dimensional configuration of UAVs is still allowed in the developed system, but the benefits in terms of extended coverage to GNs and collision avoidance are not investigated as part of this work. This means that even if UAVs have different altitudes, the mobility algorithm behaves as if they are on the same plane. An altitude optimization procedure may be introduced seamlessly on top of the system at a later time. Moreover, all UAVs can move with constant speed in any direction. Drones are complex systems that require complex controllers to manage speed, acceleration, stability and heading along the six-axis. This work focuses on the performance of the networks and on the ability of the UAVs mobility algorithm to improve the coverage of GNs. UAVs also have access to the received power of neighboring UAVs and GNs or can estimate it based on their position. Routing messages can be used to collect the received power, which is necessary to determine the link budget of the links with neighboring UAVs. The received power of GNs can be collected when an uplink message is received. Eventually, the received power can be estimated by resorting to propagation models and the positions of the nodes.",

However, for different UAV in the system, N max neighs can be approximated with the total number of UAVs currently operating in the system. The above equation allows scaling the magnitude of the attractive/repulsive AtA forces based on the relative number of neighboring UAVs.

The mean of all the points is used as a new centroid in the next iteration of the algorithm and the said process is repeated until convergence. One of the main disadvantages of k-means is that it needs to know from the beginning the number k of clusters. The selection of k is a nontrivial problem that is still at the center of many types of research. In the UAV-enabled LoRa network, the k-means algorithm is run multiple times with different values of k, with k ranging from 2 to k max and the quality of the clustering is then assessed by using the average silhouette index.

The average s avg of all s(i) is used to assess the overall quality of the clustering. In fact a particular clustering is only accepted if s avg is above a threshold s thr .

Proactively building the routing tables is, in fact, essential for the correct functioning of the UAV-enabled LoRa network mobility algorithm, since the information they contain is used to compute various important parameters. The impact of the routing protocol on the performance of the system has not been investigated as part of this work, but it is reasonable to expect that, at least in highly mobile networks, any protocol that provides fast convergence of routes and frequent periodic table updates would benefit the UAV-enabled LoRa system. The simulation parameters and their values are provided in Table 2 . Note that the altitude of UAVs is set to 60 m above the ground, which corresponds to the maximum height of trees in temperate climates. This height is suitable for disaster-ridden areas where the taller infrastructures rarely exist. The terrain is considered flat and the GNs moves at a normal walking speed of 5 km/h which is commonly used in the literature [40] . Figure 5 shows the Average End-to-End Packet Reception Rate (AE-PRR) as a function of different values of K p . It is worth mentioning that the metric AE-PRR is the average percentage of unique packets sent by all GN and correctly received by the BS through the network. To evaluate the performance of the proposed solution, we compare our approach with that of [24] . In the figure, our proposed approach is shown as a solid line, whereas, the approach of [24] is illustrated as a dashed line. In general, it can be seen that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional approach of [24] in terms of improved AE-PRR. In addition to this, it can be noticed that the number of teams influences the range of K p values that gives the best results in terms of AE-PRR. As an example, with only 4 teams and 12 UAVs, the best results are obtained with K p in the range [20, 30] , while with 5 teams and 12 UAVs the best range becomes [30, 40] . In general, we can observe that a bigger number of GNs requires bigger K p values. Another immediate and obvious consequence of adding more GNs is the decrease of the maximum achievable AE-PRR, which passes from around 0.9 with one team to almost 0.65 with five teams. Furthermore, one can observe that the difference between the packet reception rate of the proposed solution and that of [24] grows for a larger number of UAVs in the network. This is one of the most critical aspects of the proposed solution is that the high packet loss might be too penalizing for a critical application. Even when just 60 GNs divided into three teams are deployed and 12 UAVs are used, the packet loss is above 20%. This is the drive that brought to the development of the CRM and MP algorithms. K p is not only influenced by the number of teams, but also by the number of GNs per team, as it is possible to observe in Figure 6 . The figure shows the AE-PRR of two simulation scenarios: one having 3 teams of 10 GNs and the other having 3 teams of 40 GNs. Compared with the results reported in Figure 5 , in the scenario with only 10 GNs per team, the system behaves better with a lower K p (range [5, 10] ). On the contrary, in the scenario with 40 GNs per team, the system performs better with a higher K p (range [45, 50] ). This shows that a higher density of GNs moving in the same area requires bigger values of K p to obtain the best AE-PRR results. It is also interesting to study the trend of the Average Total Delay (ATD) which is expressed as the average delay of packets sent by GNs to the BS through UAVs. Specifically, it is the sum of the delay experienced in the LoRaWAN network segment and in the WiFi network segment while it also includes the delay caused by buffered packets. In this regard, a plot is shown in Figure 7 for three teams of GNs. The ATD decreases with the number of UAVs and with bigger values of K p . To understand this behavior, it is necessary to remember that the ATD is computed only on packets that are successfully received by the BS and it takes into account also the time that a packet eventually spends in the buffer. Therefore, in scenarios with few UAVs, the mesh is more subject to disconnections and the bigger number of buffered packets contributes in large part to the big delay. Disconnections and buffering time also explains why lower delays are associated with bigger values of K p : a big K p favors the compactness of the aerial mesh to the detriment of the coverage. This is confirmed by the decreasing trend of the average percentage of buffered packets shown in Figure 8 , which is an indication of the probability of disconnections in the mesh. K p must, therefore, be chosen as a compromise between the desired coverage and delay. The analysis of the other QoS metrics produces some minor observations. In conclusion, K p proved to be an important parameter that greatly influences the performance of the system. It has, therefore, to be chosen properly depending on the number of UAVs, the number of teams and the number of GNs per team. Configuring K p might be complex in a real system, due to the numerous variables that must be taken into account. A future study of a K p optimization routine is, therefore, necessary to simplify the configuration process. ",

The main objective of the system is to extend the network coverage offered by a BS to a set of mobile GNs using relaying gateways installed on UAVs. This objective is achieved thanks to a double-layer network that consists of a LoRaWAN segment for the communication between the GNs and the gateways and a WiFi ad hoc network for all the communications between the gateways and the BS. The core of the system is the UAV-enabled LoRa network mobility algorithm, specifically designed to adapt as much as possible to the ever-changing position of the GNs. It is shown that the activation of all the UAV-enabled LoRa network algorithms (VSF + CRM + MP) allows us to obtain an AE-PRR above 0.9 in a representative scenario with three teams of GNs and 12 UAVs. An acceptable AE-PRR, between 0.8 and 0.9, is obtained with 8 or 10 UAVs. We anticipate that our work would be helpful in the practical realization of such disaster management networks.",

For instance, UAVs are subject to strict energy constraints. The impact of such constraints is of great practical interest. The developed algorithm may need to be modified to limit as much as possible unnecessary movements and transmissions. A future iteration of the system might also consider the usage of fixed-wings drones to increase the maximum air-time. Moreover, the impact of outdated channel estimation can also be investigated for practical systems. These challenging tasks are left for future studies.
