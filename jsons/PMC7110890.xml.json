            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infectious disease caused by a novel type of coronavirus, designated SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1], [2], [3]. During the period January 2003 to May 2003, SARS spread rapidly among large human populations and led to thousands of infected patients and hundreds of deaths in over 30 countries [4], [5], [6]. As reported, substantial efforts have been made to isolate the SARS-CoV and study its genomic sequence [5], [6], and its ACE-2 binding receptors have been identified on target cells [7]. Increasing evidence in both animal and human models indicates that SARS-CoV infection results in multiple organ dysfunction [8], [9]. Moreover, it has been also reported that SARS-CoV infection induces specific antibody production that is considered both an effective method of diagnosis, as well as potential for a passive and active immunization for the prevention and treatment of SARS [10], [11], [12]. In addition to the induction of humoral immune responses, cell-mediated immune responses to SARS-CoV were detected in both SARS patients and animal models [13], [14], [15]. Clinical data showed that pronounced lymphopenia was observed in most SARS patients [16]. All of those reports show that T cell responses may not only participate in the clearance of virus in recovered SARS patients but also contribute to immunopathology in early stages of the disease. Therefore, it is very important to understand the role of T lymphocytes in human SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV has four structural proteins (S, N, M, and E proteins) that have various functions [5], [6]. Many reports concerning the immune responses to SARS-CoV S and N proteins have been published [17], [18], [19], the immune responses against E protein in human and animal models have not yet been studied extensively [20]. E protein is a small, 9\u201312 kDa integral membrane protein. A previous study demonstrated that SARS-CoV E protein could form ion channels [21]. E protein also plays a role in viral assembly and morphogenesis [22]. Disruption of the E protein may possibly abrogate viral infectivity [23]. Recently, Yang et al. [24] showed that SARS-CoV E protein induced apoptosis in transfected Jurkat T cells, which possibly contributes to the SARS-CoV-induced lymphopenia observed in most SARS patients. Thus SARS-CoV E protein may be a potential target for the development of antiviral drugs. Here we analyzed memory T cell responses against the E protein in a group of individuals who had clinical SARS-CoV infection between January and May 2003. Our results demonstrated that SARS-CoV E protein specific memory T cell responses including central and effector memory CD4+ and CD8+T cells could be persistent for two years. We also showed that SARS-CoV E protein might contain at least two different major epitopes, aa 9\u201326 and aa 33\u201357, which could be important in eliciting cellular immune response against SARS-CoV E protein in humans.",

Briefly, 96-well plates (Millipore) were coated with anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAb and incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The plates were washed three times before blocking with complete culture medium. Fresh PBMCs were plated at 2 \u00d7 105 cells per well in triplicate. Peptides and costimulatory mAbs to CD28 and CD49d were added at 1 \u03bcg/ml each. PBMCs stimulated with CD3 and CD28 (1 \u03bcg/ml) mAbs were used as a positive control, and as a negative control, PBMCs were not stimulated. After incubation for 20 h at 37 \u00b0C, the cells were removed and incubated with biotinylated anti-human IFN-\u03b3 detection antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, wells were developed for 1 h with streptavidin-HRP, followed by incubation with substrate reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Spot-forming cells (SFC) were detected with the ELISPOT image analysis system (Sage Creation). The frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells was calculated as the number of spots/number of total PBMCs per well and was adjusted as the number of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells/106 PBMCs. The number of spots in negative control wells was in a range of 0\u20132 spots.",

After incubation for 72 h, the culture supernatants were collected and assessed for the production of IFN-\u03b3 by ELISA.

Similarly, the frequency of SARS-CoV E antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3-producing cells determined by IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay in PBMCs from 8 fully recovered SARS individuals was significantly higher than that of the cells from the normal donor controls in response to E peptides (Fig. 1B).

Although the results showed that the T-cell epitopes were scattered throughout the sequence of E protein, some peptides were recognized more frequently than others. The peptides that were frequently recognized by T cells were E2 (aa 9 to 26), E5 (aa 33 to 49) and E6 (aa 40 to 57).

Peptides E2 (aa 9 to 26), E5 (aa 33 to 49) and E6 (aa 40 to 57) are important epitopes of SARS-CoV E antigen. Persistence of E-specific memory T cell responses in SARS patients may play an important role in protection from SARS-CoV re-infection.",

(A) PBMCs from six SARS-recovered donors were cultured in 96-well plates with or without a pool of E peptides for 72 h. The culture supernatants were collected and assessed for the production of IFN-\u03b3 by ELISA. All assays were performed in triplicate. (B) PBMCs from eight SARS-recovered donors were stimulated with or without a pool of E peptides. IFN-\u03b3-producing cells were determined by ELISPOT assay. The number of spots in the medium control wells ranged from 0 to 2. All assays were performed in triplicate. Normal subjects without any contact history with SARS patients were used as negative controls. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t-test, and a statistically significant difference was set at P < 0.05(**). Bars indicate mean values.",
