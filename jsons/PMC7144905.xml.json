            "text": "Isothermal methods, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), are attractive for nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) in point-of-care and limited-resource settings (1,2). LAMP in particular shows promise as a NAAT with fewer hardware requirements compared with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (3). Despite advancements, the ability to optimize LAMP NAATs for a specific target sequence and primer set (specific to a target organism) remains constrained by a limited understanding of how amplification is affected by myriad factors, including polymerase choice, primer design, temperature, time and ion concentrations. In particular, addressing non-specific amplification remains a core problem as it constrains an assay's limit of detection (LOD). In reactions containing template target molecules, both specific and non-specific amplification reactions may occur. Unlike PCR, LAMP lacks a temperature-gating mechanism, so non-specific reactions consume reagents and compete with specific amplification impacting its kinetics. The presence of non-specific amplicons therefore adversely impacts both the assay's analytical sensitivity (the fewest template molecules that can be detected) and its analytical specificity (ability to detect the target template in the presence of competing reactions). Classifying reactions as either specific or non-specific amplification would therefore be invaluable both during assay optimization and assay deployment in clinical diagnostics.",

For example, chlamydia (caused by the pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, CT) is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide, with more than 110 million cases reported annually (4). Diagnosis of CT infections is challenged by a lack of standard symptoms (many infections are asymptomatic) (5) and the presence of mixed flora (particularly in the female reproductive tract) (6). Thus, rapid NAATs with high sensitivity and specificity are critically needed, especially NAATs that can deal with the high levels of host or background DNA likely to be present in clinical samples such as urine samples and swabs (7,8).",

            "text": "Optimizing LAMP for CT and other infectious pathogens requires addressing and reducing non-specific amplification or a method for separating non-specific reactions from specific amplification. Reactions run in bulk (i.e. in a tube) in the absence of template can be informative to provide information on performance of non-specific amplification. Another method to identify non-specific amplification includes mathematical modeling in conjunction with electrophoresis to distinguish between non-specific and specific banding patterns (9). However, in the presence of template, although specific and non-specific reactions occur simultaneously, they cannot be monitored simultaneously. Thus, bulk reactions have three important limitations with regard to assay optimization: (i) differences in the kinetics of specific and non-specific reactions cannot be separated, (ii) rare but significant events, such as early but infrequent non-specific amplification, cannot be easily characterized; and (iii) testing the full design space requires many hundreds of replicates to obtain statistically significant data. To improve an assay's analytical specificity and sensitivity, one strategy is to eliminate the detection of non-specific amplification. In bulk LAMP experiments, non-specific amplification can be excluded from detection by using probes, beacons, FRET or reporter-quencher schemes that show only specific amplification of the target (10\u201319). Although these methods improve the assay, they do not capture non-specific reactions and thus cannot give insights into the origin of non-specific amplification or the conditions that led to non-specific amplicons. Moreover, probes and beacons do not eliminate non-specific amplification; non-specific amplification still competes for reagents and can limit the extent of the signal generated by specific amplification events (20). Hence, it is highly desirable to distinguish specific from non-specific amplification.",

Digital single-molecule methods separating individual amplification events into discrete compartments, eliminating interference among individual amplification events (21,22). Furthermore, digital experiments consist of thousands of reactions that run in parallel and thus provide valuable statistical information (21\u201323). We used real-time imaging to monitor the kinetics of 20,000 dLAMP reactions per experiment and observe \u223c1.2 \u00d7 106 reactions in total. We hypothesized that high-resolution melting analysis (HRM) could be a tool for separating specific from non-specific amplification events and for identifying the optimal digital threshold data-processing parameters to distinguish specific and non-specific amplification events (even when an assay is deployed without HRM). To test this hypothesis, we used a dLAMP assay with CT DNA as the target (combined with sequencing to identify the products of bulk reactions) to analyze both specific and non-specific amplification under conditions that include clinically relevant concentrations of background human DNA.",

This indicated Bst 3.0 could be a useful model for studying non-specific amplification.

To investigate the role of the concentration of the target on the incidence of non-specific amplification, we performed half-log dilutions of template from 10 to 0.316 cp/\u03bcl. At 3.16 cp/\u03bcl (Figure 1E and F), only specific amplification occurred (24 replicate wells/plate). However, once template concentrations reached 1 cp/\u03bcl (Figure 1G and H), non-specific amplification occurred with greater frequency than specific amplification (18 of the 24 replicates generated false positives). Similarly, for 0.316 cp/\u03bcl (Figure 1I and J) 15 of the 24 replicates generated false positives. We next ran the same assay in the absence of template (no-template control, NTC) (Figure 1K and L). Even though we did not expect amplification, we observed all reactions amplified. A total of 44 of 45 replicates amplified at a Tm of 91\u00b0C, consistent with the Tm of non-specific amplification in the presence of template. Although it is possible for a reaction to generate multiple different non-specific amplification products, even ones with Tm matching to the specific products, the single amplicon observed at 88\u00b0C in the NTC was a contaminant that appeared to have the same sequence as the specific products (Figure 2A [well F8]). In general, when the specific target was present, it amplified sooner and outcompeted the non-specific amplification, thereby reducing the number of observations of non-specific amplification. To determine if the non-specific amplification was inherent to the polymerase or a consequence of buffer selection, we conducted additional studies using both Bst polymerases (Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S1).",

Other potential mechanisms include LIMA (30) and UIMA (31), but are inconsistent with our sequencing results, which observe nearly equal reads of the forward and reverse strand as measured by counting the complementary sequences between each junction. Our proposed mechanism requires properties that have been observed with Bst enzymes: a strand-displacing polymerase lacking 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity\u2014common to polymerases from thermophilic bacteria (32,33), template switching ability to allow synthesis across a discontinuous template (33), terminal transferase activity, or the ability to perform non-templated synthesis (32,34\u201335). Briefly, the non-specific product likely arises from extension of a low probability homo-dimerization of the Backward Inner Primer (BIP), followed by elongation across a discontinuous junction (\u2018template switching\u2019) to form a double-stranded product incorporating Forward Inner Primer (FIP). Through breathing of the molecule, the 3\u2032 of one strand may form a second hairpin and amplify. Some of these amplification events incorporate several random nucleotides via terminal nucleotidyl transferase activity resulting in a pool of hairpins with 3\u2032 randomers. Sequences with complementary randomers are selected in vitro to amplify. The double-stranded product of this amplification can, through intramolecular hydrogen bonding, form two dumbbell-like structures and amplify in a fashion similar to the standard LAMP mechanism, but primed by BIP. Repetitive cycles of self-priming and hairpin priming by BIP result in numerous sequences with complementarity and the possibility of multiple replication loci within a single molecule. This process can give rise to very long amplicons, and even a branched, mesh-like network from the multimeric sequences annealing to their neighbors or in a self-complementary fashion. A simplified version of this mechanism, annotated with sequencing data, can be found in Supplementary Figure S3.",

Bst polymerase is highly prone to mismatched extension (36), and the two base pairs of CG provide a sufficient anchoring in the 3\u2032 to start elongation. Multiple Primer Analyzer (ThermoFisher) does not identify the BIP homodimer, unless maximum sensitivity is used. Alternatively, BIP-prcBIP product may arise from a single stranded BIP-hairpin, as has been observed by others (37), although UNAfold (IDT) does not predict the formation of the hairpin for this primer. These structures may not need to be abundant at equilibrium, but as long as they are extended by the polymerase, the product will be stabilized and will accumulate.",

            "text": "Upon accumulation of the BIP-prcBIP construct, the reverse complement of FIP (rcFIP) is incorporated by template switching (Figure 4-2). The 3\u2032 of FIP is within spatial proximity of the homo-BIP sequence due to microhomology of to 5\u2032 end of the double-stranded sequence coupled with rapid breathing of two base pairs of TA. This allows temporary insertion and hybridization of FIP with the double-stranded BIP-prcBIP sequence (Figure 4-3). When the polymerase is also in proximity of this reaction, FIP slips out of the junction, and the polymerase elongates across the 3\u2032 discontinuous junction (33,35) templated by FIP (Figure 4-4). We confirmed the interaction of FIP and BIP produced the high-Tm non-specific amplification, and that elimination of 3\u2032 microhomology could significantly reduce high-Tm non-specific amplification (Supplementary Figures S4\u20136 and Tables S3\u20134). After elongation, the FIP which has served as template, is poised to prime in the opposite direction (Figure 4-5). This either displaces the initial BIP mispairing (BIP*) or opens the hairpin, resulting in a double-stranded BIP-prcBIP-FIP product (Figure 4-6). This three part junction is observed as a complete product in NGS data. Breathing of double-stranded BIP-prcBIP-FIP is prone to formation of an intramolecular self-priming hairpin of rcBIP-pBIP (Figure 4-7). Elongation of the 3\u2032 hairpin results in a double-stranded FIP-pBIP-rcBIP-rcFIP hairpin (Figure 4-8) and displacement of a BIP-prcBIP-rcFIP hairpin (Figure 4-9), which may be primed by FIP to restart this cycle (Figure 4-10). With each amplification, and re-prime by FIP, a single product is generated. This process of hairpin accumulation would cause the linear \u2018rinsing\u2019 baseline observed by other researchers (37).",

Our sequencing methods are unable to observe a FIP-randomer hairpin because adapter ligation requires double-stranded products. This pool of hairpins with random sequences will accumulate until LAMP selects for sequences that amplify by sharing complementary 3\u2032 \u2018toe holds\u2019 (Figure 4-12). Much like in vitro evolution, those sequences with the highest probability of amplification are selected (32). The lack of a thermal gating mechanism in LAMP and lack of 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity makes the amplification reaction especially prone to in vitro evolution of self-amplifying products. When considered in this light, it is unsurprising that non-specific amplification could arise from mechanisms similar to the specific products. Within a given bulk reaction, variation in randomer sequence length and identity was low. However, between different samples, randomer sequences of multiple lengths and identities were observed. These two results further suggest that in bulk reactions amplification occurs from one or a few sequences (Supplementary Table Groups S5\u20137).",

            "text": "Elongation from the randomer overhang results in a double-stranded products, leading to dumbbell structures, and LAMP-like amplification. First, elongation of hairpins with complementary randomer toe holds produces a dimer of FIP-BIP-prcBIP-rcFIP coupled through the randomer (Figure 4-13). Breathing of the molecule can result in formation of intramolecular hairpins, and eventual disassociation into two separate self-priming, dumbbell shaped hairpins (Figure 4-15 and -16). The products of elongation from self-priming amplification doubles the amount of dsDNA present and forms sequences with internal hairpins capable of priming by BIP (Figure 4-17). Elongation from BIP priming creates a new double-stranded product and reveals a self-priming 3\u2032 hairpin of the original strand (Figure 4-18), which upon elongation, displaces the sequence primed by BIP (Figure 4-19) while transforming the trimer of FIP-BIP-prcBIP-rcFIP to a pentamer (more than tripling the amount of ds products from structures 15 and 16). The pentamer still contains an rcBIP hairpin, and may amplify in a functionally similar method as previously (Figure 4-17). The displaced product Figure 4-19 is similar to Figure 4-16 but missing 5\u2032-FIP. However, similar to Figure 4-16, this product is self-priming and produces a structure with an internal rcBIP hairpin (Figure 4-20). A second priming of the hairpin by BIP of the rcBIP-pBIP hairpin and subsequent elongation, creates a new double-stranded product and reveals a self-priming 3\u2032 hairpin of the original strand (Figure 4-21). As previously, upon elongation, the sequence primed by BIP is displaced (Figure 4-22). Simultaneously, the self-priming event turns the FIP-BIP-prcBIP trimer to a pentamer, which may continue to be amplified by BIP. The released sequence (Figure 4-22) is again self-priming, and whose product is equivalent to Figure 4-20 to restart the cycle. Further, amplified hairpins may, in addition to BIP priming of the hairpin, duplicate through self-priming by breathing and formation of a 3\u2032 rcBIP-pBIP hairpin (Figure 4-23).",

As evidence, when the mechanism of seed formation is disrupted through elimination of the microhomology, amplicons with high Tm still occur, albeit with lower frequency and delayed occurrence (Supplementary Figures S4\u20136 and Tables S3\u20134). Template switching and non-template synthesis are 100\u00d7 slower than template extension (33). However, once the self-amplifying products are selected, the reaction follows standard exponential LAMP enrichment. Thus, accumulation of a sufficient pool of randomers may take time, but still result in a delayed bulk exponential amplification event. Furthermore, should a hairpin with attached randomer form, it is possible that the rising baseline, attributed to hairpin formation (37), may also by in vitro selection of the products, lead to and result in spontaneous exponential amplification.",

We found that TTP can be heterogeneous while Tm is constant (28.6 \u00b1 8.9 min with 87.5 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C), indicating that the same product may initiate at different times (Figure 5F). This is consistent with our knowledge of the stochastic initiation of LAMP (23,38\u201339). Further, we observed some variability in the maximum rate despite similar Tm (23.7 \u00b1 6.8 RFU/30 s, with 87.5 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C Tm), which indicates the same product may amplify at different velocities (Figure 5G). In general, we observed that maximum rate often corresponded to the point when the reaction first began to amplify. By plotting rate as a function of TTP (Figure 5H) we observed little fluctuation in rate across a range of different TTPs (23.7 \u00b1 6.8 RFU/30 s with 28.6 \u00b1 8.9 min), indicating that the differences in TTP are mostly delays in the initiation of amplification rather than differences in the rate of amplification.",

We were able to distinguish the clustering of high-Tm non-specific products separately from specific amplification using a threshold of 88.5\u201390.3\u00b0C (Figure 6C and Supplementary Figure S8A). We illustrate each partition with only partial opacity so that when false positives in the NTC (red) overlap with false positives in the template-containing sample (blue), the overlap of multiple colors appears purple (Figure 6D). Color intensity indicates the abundance of paritions at a given TTP and temperature. To further illustrate how this approach can be used to differentiate specific and non-specific amplification, we next selected a region where both specific and non-specific products were observed. For Bst 3.0, we were able to distinguish the clustering of high-Tm non-specific products separately from specific amplification using the threshold of 91.25\u201392.75\u00b0C (Figure 6E) and we observed better separation of specific and non-specific amplification than with Bst 2.0 (Figure 6F and Supplementary Figure S8B).

Previously, we demonstrated that rate could be used to correct for some non-specific amplification using Escherichia coli 23S primers (23), so we wished to test whether we could use maximum rate as a way to differentiate specific and non-specific amplification. Generally, specific and non-specific amplification reactions did not have the same maximum rate. For Bst 2.0, non-specific amplification tended to have a slower max rate than specific amplification, although there was some overlap (Figure 6G). At high Tm, the clustering of non-specific amplification in both the presence of template and in the NTC were observed at >90.5\u00b0C and below \u223c50 RFU/30 s (Figure 6H). For Bst 3.0, although there was substantial overlap, we again observed that non-specific amplification tended to have slower maximum rate than specific amplification (Figure 6I). Examining the high-Tm amplification events, non-specific amplification collects above 92.75\u00b0C and has maximum rate extending out to 75 RFU/30 s (Figure 6J). For both enzymes, overlap between specific and non-specific amplification was similar and specific amplification tended to be faster. However, the maximum rate of specific amplification between the two enzymes differed; Bst 2.0 had a maxium rate of 150 RFU/30 s, whereas Bst 3.0 did not exceed 100 RFU/30 s. Bst 2.0 performing faster than Bst 3.0 is consistent with our previous observations using an E. Coli 23S primer set (23). Additionally, the maximum rate of non-specific amplification in Bst 2.0 tended to be lower than non-specific amplification in Bst 3.0 (50 and 75 RFU/30 s, respectively). Consequently, the extent of overlap of specific and non-specific amplificaiton was greater for Bst 3.0 than Bst 2.0.",

After 90 min of amplification, a partition should theoretically reach a fluorescence maximum whereby all reagents are consumed, amplification plateaus and thus the final intensity would be independent of the maximum rate of amplification. However, surprisingly, we observed a general scaling between the maximum rate and the final intensity of the partition. For Bst 2.0, all amplification in the NTC has final intensity <1017 RFU and maximum rate <53.4 RFU/30 s. In the presence of template, 79.7% of non-specific amplification and 52.3% of specific amplification had final intensity and maximum rate less than these thresholds. For Bst 3.0, 87.7% of amplification in the NTC has final intensity <1017 RFU and maximum rate <53.4 RFU/30 s. In the presence of template, 89.0% of non-specific amplification but only 45.6% of specific amplification fell within these thresholds using Bst 3.0. Thus, false positives were generally dimmer and had slower maximum rates than most true\u2010positive events. When examining the brightest partitions, Bst 2.0 (Figure 6K) and Bst 3.0 (Figure 6L) exhibit a similar maximal final intensity near 3000 RFU. These maxima are also surprising, considering our 12-bit camera is capable of imaging up to 4096 RFU (the detector was not at saturation). We suspect that this maxima corresponds to consumption of one of the reagents; while scaling between maximum rate and final intensity occurs when stochastically initiated reactions have not completely amplified, resulting in partitions dimmer than the maxima and proportional to their rate of amplification.",

In the first 12 min of amplification, we observed six non-specific amplification events in Bst 2.0 (four in the presence of template; two in the NTC; Figure 6O), and we observed 13 non-specific events in Bst 3.0 (10 in the presence of template; three in the NTC; Figure 6P). For both polymerases, we were able to distinguish the rare, fast and early non-specific amplicons from true positives. For Bst 2.0, these non-specific amplifications were slower than the fastest true positives, and occurred at similar times. In contrast, for Bst 3.0, the earliest amplification events were false positives and tended to have similar rates to the true positives. We hypothesize that in bulk reactions, the fast and early non-specific amplification events (as seen in Bst 3.0 Figure 6P) lead to non-specific measurements, whereas non-specific amplification that coincides with specific amplification, but proceeds at a slower rate (as seen in Bst 2.0 Figure 6O), would still produce specific amplification in bulk. This hypothesis is corroborated by sequencing of bulk LAMP reactions (Figure 2). Though individual bulk reactions may be assigned a homogeneous label as \u2018true positive\u2019 or \u2018false positive\u2019 by Tm, sequencing identifies multiple products within each reaction and the Tm is determined by the dominant product. For example, we observed a \u2018false positive\u2019 by Tm (Figure 1C and D), despite the presence of template. The sequencing of this product, contained non-specific product sequences, similar to those observed in the NTC, at high prevalence, as well as the specific target sequences in low abundance (Figure 2 [well C7]). Similarly, though \u2018true positive\u2019 is assigned to other bulk reactions in the presence of template, the non-specific products are still observed at low abundance (e.g. Figure 2 [well F8]). Further, a greater number of non-specific partitions in digital using Bst 3.0 than Bst 2.0, is correlated with a greater number of non-specific reads despite the presence of template in the sequencing data (Comparing Figures 6A-B and 2B group A versus C). We hypothesize that the combination of real-time parameters (such as rate and TTP), combined with the ability of digital assays to yield probabilities and to assign reaction identity through HRM, may ultimately help researchers optimize bulk reaction conditions.",

This was true for both polymerases. Additionally, we observed two types of non-specific amplification. The first type of non-specific was the traditional \u2018primer-dimer\u2019 cloud, which is characterized by a low Tm, low final fluorescence intensity, a slow max rate and a generally late TTP. The second type of non-specific cloud matches only in its high Tm, and spans a wide range of rates, TTP and final intensities. The high-Tm non-specific amplification occurs with greater frequency than the low-Tm non-specific amplification. The major differences between the polymerases can also be resolved with this visualization. The number of non-specific amplification events is much fewer for Bst 2.0 than for Bst 3.0.

We categorized amplification events as specific and non-specific based on Tm as previously. First, we asked: Is there a relationship between fraction of template molecules amplified in dLAMP and amplification time? We then determined the total number of template copies loaded into a chip relative to the copies measured by ddPCR. If amplification initiation is stochastic, as observed in Figures 5F and 6A-B, does longer assay time increase \u2018efficiency\u2019 and thereby improve LOD when using Tm (as seen in Figure 7C and F)? We observe that for Bst 2.0 a large number of partitions amplify at in the first 11.5 min, followed by a second phase after 20 min where additional partitions amplify with lower frequency (Figure 9A). The mode TTP for concentrations less than 5000 HHGE per \u03bcl was \u223c11.6 \u00b1 0.2 min (Supplementary Table S8 and Figures S10A-11C). After the mode TTP, the frequency of observing specific amplification in the absence of HHGE decreases from a maximum frequency of 1.2 \u00b1 0.1% copies detected per 30 s to a lower average frequency of 0.23 \u00b1 0.04% copies per 30 s from 20 to 90 min (Figure 9A). For Bst 3.0 (Figure 10A), we observe a similar trend temporally, though mode TTP was at least 2 min slower and had greater variability than Bst 2.0 (Supplementary Table S8, Figures S10B-11D). Further, Bst 3.0 consistently amplified fewer target molecules than Bst 2.0 at all time points. This highlights the stochastic nature of amplification using LAMP, and importance in choice of enzyme on sensitivity. In theory, assays employing Tm could be run until all partitions amplify as either a false or true positive. Allow all partitions to amplify would give the highest possible number of target copies amplified and lowest possible LOD when using Tm in the final assay.",

For Bst 2.0, we observed consistent non-specific amplification products with high and low Tm, regardless of concentration of hgDNA. Single digital partition counts were observed at low-Tm non-specific amplification in both the presence of template and the NTC and independent of hgDNA concentration (Figure 9B and C). The fraction of partitions generating a false-positive amplification at low Tm was less than 3.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 through 45 min (i.e. 7 or fewer events in 20,000 partitions per chip). Similarly, partition counts of high-Tm non-specific amplification are <10 per chip until 45 min. After 90 min, high-Tm non-specific amplification is more prevalent than low-Tm non-specific amplification and the reactions finish with fewer than non-specific 260 counts in 20,000 partitions corresponding to a false-positive fraction of 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22122. One exception is the non-specific high-Tm amplification in the absence template and HHGE. This condition appears to have lower non-specific background than other conditions. We collected each replicate on separate days and are able to observe the experimental variability between the presence and absence fo template, which might be otherwise lost when examining the NTC alone. This experiment emphasizes the advantage of determining non-specific amplificaiton using Tm from the same experiment as specific amplification is counted. At low background rates, such as when using Bst 2.0, inherant variability exists in the false-positive fraction and can impact LOD. Measuring non-specific amplificaiton from within an experimental eliminates the assumption that the false-positive rate remains identical to the NTC or between experimental runs.",

As previously, incorporation of HRM into the final assay does not impact the LOD when using Bst 2.0. When using Bst 3.0 (Supplementary Figure S11F) and HRM to remove non-specific amplification, LOD tracks with the number of true-positive events. Thus, LOD becomes worse when efficiency is lower (i.e. at 5000 HHGE per \u03bcl). Similarly, when HRM is not incorporated in the assay, higher concentrations of HHGE tend to result in a worse LOD.

Generally, investigators should examine their own primer sets in the presence of high concentrations of hgDNA and take caution when examining clinical samples with high leukocyte concentrations (as reported by urinanalysis).

Partitions A and B are visible at 20 min; partition C becomes visible at 45 min. (B) Fluorescence micrographs of individual partitions are traced across temperatures during an HRM experiment. As the double-stranded DNA in each partition de-hybridizes, the intercalating dye is released and fluorescence decreases.

Orange curves correspond to partitions A\u2013C from panel A. (D) Traces of fluorescence intensity as a function of temperature for individual partitions during melting experiments.
