Depending on area, considerations for shelter should include provision of air flow in the summer with wind breaks in the winter, shade, and dry ground.1 The hierarchy within camelid herds makes it imperative that shelters be sufficiently large, with large enough openings that all animals, especially the young, old, or thin, are able to enter without harassment. It is easy to design and provide adequate pasture and shelter for the healthy population of animals on the farm. On the other hand, hospital, maternity, and quarantine facilities should be well designed and constructed to be separate from each other and from the main herd groups.",

Quality and quantity of forage and dung-pile management are factors to include in stocking density recommendations. In general, camelids should be supplied approximately 2% of their body weight in dry matter for maintenance, with pregnant, lactating, or growing animals consuming 1.5 to 2 times that amount.3 Fresh hay should be offered daily and feeders should be monitored for feed sorting, with feeding amounts adjusted accordingly. Palatable camelid- or sheep-labeled mineral mixes should be offered in every herd and actively monitored for consumption. Cattle, goat, or horse mineral should not be offered to camelids because of the risk of copper toxicity. Pasture rotation or intensive grazing can be a useful tool from a nutritional and parasite standpoint, improving land usage and reducing larval burdens across land. It is recommended that pasture rotation or housing changes not be made after 8 months of gestation in pregnant females. This is the time of gestation where uterine torsion occurs most commonly.4 This environment change often leads to animals exhibiting rolling behavior, which is believed to be a cause of uterine torsion in this species.5\n",

The establishment of dung piles by camelids provides some resistance to internal parasite transmission. In many herds, however, this pile is created near feeders or inside the shelter. When near feeders, smaller animals, who often sustain themselves on orts from the feeder, will have increased exposure to infective larvae. Sheltered dung piles are protected from the elements (sun and freezing), which provide some killing of larvae. Dung piles should be cleared at least weekly or biweekly, and more often when they occur around feeders or are sheltered.",

When an intestinal parasite problem is encountered, through diagnosis of clinical disease or demonstration of high egg counts on fecal screening, stocking density and dung-pile management should be evaluated and fecal flotations should be performed on 10% or 10 animals (whichever is greater) in the herd monthly. Both quantitative and qualitative fecal examinations should be performed by technicians or veterinarians with training and experience in reading camelid fecal preparations. It is strongly recommended in herds with parasite burdens and apparent poor response to drugs to do fecal egg count reduction tests, in which an initial fecal flotation (quantitative) is performed, a dewormer is given, and a fecal examination is repeated in 2 weeks. The dewormer is considered effective if there is a greater than 90% reduction in fecal egg count. When the monthly fecal flotation findings show negative or negligible counts, parasite monitoring can then be continued quarterly.",

Meningeal worm is transmitted from white-tailed deer to camelids through arboreal snails.7, 8, 9 As such, deer-proof fencing, introduction of guinea fowl, and the use of molluscicides can minimize transmission. Removal of organic matter, in the form of leaf or wood piles, and establishment of pasture perimeters using limestone or gravel also inhibits snail and slug habitation in camelid pastures.10 More complete assessments of parasite control measures are covered in the articles \u201cGastrointestinal Parasitology\u201d by Ballweber and \u201cNeurological Diseases\u201d by Whitehead and Bedenice elsewhere in this issue.",

Next, the three pairs of fighting teeth, or upper fourth incisor and upper and lower canine teeth, should be evaluated. These erupt around 2 to 2.5 years of age in most animals and should be trimmed, particularly in males, to prevent camelids from injuring human beings and other animals. These may be trimmed using diamond Dremel bits or obstetric wire, removing the sharp point and leaving 2 mm to 4 mm of the crown above the gumline to prevent tooth abscessation. Side cutters or other manual cutting tools are strongly discouraged because of the high risk of tooth fracture. Forced extraction of these teeth is also discouraged, particularly of the mandibular canine, because of its proximity to the mental nerve and third incisor and risk of mandibular fracture.14 In geriatric animals, the molars should be examined for abnormal wear and the development of points or wavemouth. If noticed, this wear should be recorded along with the animal's body condition score (BCS), and a physical examination and feeding history obtained. Molar teeth should not be floated in camelids as in horses unless abnormal wear is seen, accompanied by weight loss, and a history of dropping feed or dysphagia. It is common for geriatric camelids to experience wear of molars down to the gumline, frequently resulting in severe weight loss and death.

Animal weighing should be a routine procedure for all South American camelid (SAC) owners and done when using anthelmintics or other pharmaceuticals to ensure accurate dosing. BCS should be performed on all animals within a herd monthly throughout the year to ensure timely intervention. The authors use a 1 to 10 scale,3 with 1 being emaciated, 10 being obese, and 5 being ideal. It is imperative that BCS be performed by palpation of the animal, not visual examination, because of the thick fiber coat. The first area to be palpated is the lumbar region (loin). The muscle and fat in this region should slope down directly from the tip of the vertebral spinous process to the tip of the transverse process. A concavity of this slope would put the BCS of the animal below 5, while a convexity places the animal above (Fig. 6\n). Next, the ribs are palpated in the fiberless area behind the elbow. Difficulty in palpation of the ribs in combination with a convex loin places that animal at a BCS greater than 6. Obese animals may also be further classified by evaluation of fat deposits in the brisket and inguinal regions. Beyond these guidelines, BCS is a subjective scoring system, making it preferable to have the same person perform BCS each month so that there is consistency between measures. Records of BCS should be maintained for individuals in the herd along with the date of examination. A sudden change in BCS or the observation of a trend on any animal should be brought to the attention of the attending veterinarian.",

The breeder must be patient and first observe the cria at a distance to ensure that he is fully developed, has adjusted to extra-uterine life, is behaving normally16 and bonding with the dam. A brief period of nostrils flaring or perhaps open-mouth breathing may be present within the first few minutes after birth, but should not be accompanied by obvious distress or audible stertor.17 Healthy crias usually stand within 1 hour, walk within 2 hours, and nurse successfully within 2 to 4 hours after birth. Nursing is more frequent (one to four times per hour) during daylight and may last from 30 seconds to several minutes at a time.18 Meconium is typically passed around 18 to 24 hours of age.17 Meconium impaction often occurs in dehydrated or hypothermic crias who show decreased to absent nursing and persistent tenesmus in the face of normal urination. A warm soapy water enema (10 mL\u201312 mL for alpaca cria, 12 mL\u201324 mL for llama cria) should be administered using a soft, flexible, small-diameter catheter.19 It can be repeated if meconium is not passed within 30 to 60 minutes after the first enema. Although infrequent, refractory cases involving impaction within the spiral colon may require oral administration of corn syrup (10 mL\u201320 mL by mouth, every 12 hours: osmotic laxative) or intravenous fluids. The use of Fleet enemas available in human pharmacies is not recommended. The author (MB) has seen several cases of peritonitis-induced proctitis and hyperphosphatemia associated with repeated administration of this product in newborn SACs. In healthy crias, rectal temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate range from 100\u00b0F to 102\u00b0F, 80 to 120 beats per minute, and 10 to 30 breaths per minute. Most crias born in the early spring or late fall are at risk for hypothermia; therefore, wearing a fitted coat at least for the first 24 to 72 hours of life is advisable.",

The primary risk factors associated with infectious agents include virulence factors, size of inoculum or exposure dose, strain variation, and whether one or several infections exist concomitantly.45 The size of inoculum (pathogen concentration) represents the major factor determining the severity of clinical disease and the rapidity of its onset.45 It is also important to remember that nonpathogens can become pathogenic, given the right circumstances.44 Pathogenic microorganisms differ in virulence, contagiousness, and modes of transmission.37 In the case of bacterial diseases, virulence factors associated include surface pili or fimbriae, which allow for attachment to the host, and production of various toxins or enzymes, which enhance host cell damage or promote bacterial survival despite cell-mediated or humoral response of the host. Plasmid or integron-mediated antimicrobial resistance is also considered an important virulence factor, especially for enteric bacteria in calves.45 Virulence factors associated with viruses, protozoa, and nematodes has been less-well described. Undoubtedly, they will vary upon the pathogen in cause. A detailed list of infectious disease agents identified in alpacas has been published.41 From this list, Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV), neonatal diarrhea complex, gastrointestinal parasites, Streptococcus equi ssp zooepidemicus, Brucella melitensis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are of primary concern for North American SACs.",

Although periparturient females are at greater risk for diseases when compared with nonpregnant females and castrated or intact males present on the premises, younger stock are typically more immunologically naive than mature animals, thus more susceptible to infectious agents.41 The most important risk factor for diseases in young crias beyond congenital (cleft palate, choanal atresia), developmental (rickets), or heritable defects is failure of passive transfer (FPT) of maternal antibodies. Predisposing factors for FPT include unsupervised delivery, which may result in neonatal maladjustment syndrome (hypoxia during stage II labor) or hypothermia from misadventure at pasture following birth. Musculoskeletal injuries can limit mobility and ability to nurse: it should be suspected in neonates born with assistance who cannot stand within 4 hours of birth. For experienced dams, maternal factors leading to FPT include teats or mammary gland abnormalities including retained wax plugs, mastitis,42 agalactia, or conditions leading to recumbency.41 Clearly, inexperienced dams may not allow the cria to nurse, which may also result in FPT.",

Fortunately, environmental risk factors are often amenable to the implementation of specific biosecurity practices, mainly centered on improving animal comfort.41 These risk factors include atmospheric conditions (temperature hot or cold, percent of humidity, wind chill, natural or artificial ventilation, and other such factors); housing (pasture, dry lot, barns, for example); physical environment (bedding, cleaning and disinfection protocols, including fecal pellets removal and disposal, and so forth); stocking density; general hygiene and hygiene related to feeding practices; and miscellaneous stress resulting from handling and transportation.41 Access to clean, fresh drinking water at all times is essential. During cold seasons of the year, animals should be provided adequate bedding, shelter, and diet with sufficient energy density, protein, and mineral content. During warm, hot, and humid seasons, management conditions should be centered on heat stress prevention (see \u201cRoutine husbandry\u201d section, above). Barns or other buildings housing animals indoors, regardless of the time of the year, should be adequately ventilated. Consistent removal of fecal pellets, soiled bedding material, uneaten feed, well as proper drainage of stalls and soils will aid in minimizing local pathogen accumulation41 and potential insect breeding sites.34 This is further facilitated by the unique behavior of SACs, who urinate and defecate in one specific area of a stall, lot, or pasture. Feeding practices and water sources should be designed to prevent fecal contamination from herd mates, other domestic animals (dogs, cats, and so forth), rodents, and birds.41 Handling, shearing, transportation, out-of-farm boarding, and hospitalization are common stressful events that should be managed to alleviate unnecessary tension or distress. Stress of transportation can be minimized by providing good footing, feed, water, and hauling of a companion. For hospitalized patients, close proximity of a familiar herd mate should be considered. If this is not possible, placement of mirror in the stall of such patient mimic the presence of a very familiar herd mate.",

The latter also include all SACs returning from shows or auctions, activities extremely common in the alpaca and llama industry. As mentioned previously, the likelihood of disease transmission is exacerbated by stress caused by loading, mixing, and transportation,25 and this appears particularly true with most pathogens. When numerous animals of various ages and originating from different sources are commingled together, especially after long-distance travel, risk of disease transmission is extremely high.73 Furthermore, one must assume that changes in the environment, such as different climatic and lighting conditions, bedding material, feed or water sources, and closer contacts to visitors with various provenance during such events, can pose a significant source of stress on the animals.",

Crias are immunocompetent at birth76 and, therefore, active immunization may be attempted during the neonatal period. Vaccination of the healthy cria against C. perfringens types C and D and C. tetani (CDT), using full dosages of toxoid vaccines, should occur at 48 to 72 hours after birth, with a booster administered 2 weeks later. Llamas have shown the ability to develop antitoxin responses to C. perfringens Types C and D77 and C. tetani.78 The duration of immunity for CDT vaccines is not known, but annual vaccination is recommended. It may be advisable to administer this vaccine 4 to 6 weeks before expected parturition to provide tetanus protection for birth-associated trauma and to increase colostral immunity for these pathogens. The author (MJ) recommends that, if a husbandry procedure (ie, castration) or injury occurs that would place an animal at risk for tetanus, a tetanus toxoid booster should be given at the time of the procedure if the animal's last tetanus toxoid has occurred more than 6 months previously. If that animal's tetanus toxoid was more than a year previously or is not known, a tetanus antitoxin should be administered at the time of injury. In general, CDT trivalent vaccines are sufficient and should be the preferred product to avoid adverse reactions and injection site reactions. In regions where snakebite or liver flukes are common, which predispose to other serious clostridial infections (C. septicum, C. novyi and C. haemolyticum), a seven- or eight-way Clostridium vaccination may be considered. If they are used, it is recommended to recheck the injection site 1 week after vaccination for a local adverse reaction.",

When abortions occur in a herd, all fetal materials should be submitted, along with maternal blood, to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory for infectious disease testing. The dam should be isolated from the herd, as for a newly added animal, and monitored for further clinical signs of disease. If an infectious agent is identified, vaccination against that agent may be considered as part of a comprehensive herd health-preventive program to minimize risk. Leptospirosis has been diagnosed in SACs79 and causes both reproductive and renal disease. In herds or areas where leptospirosis is an endemic disease, vaccination with multivalent bovine vaccines may be performed. Alpacas have been vaccinated experimentally and measured-antibody response has occurred.80 There is evidence of short-lived immunity in alpacas vaccinated against Leptospira\n80 and it is recommended that high-risk farms vaccinate females before breeding and again at mid-gestation.76 This vaccine may need to be given up to four times annually in endemic areas where wildlife and contaminated water-source exposure cannot be controlled.42 Another potential abortive agent, Chlamydiophila (formerly Chlamydia), isolated from infected fetal materials, may be vaccinated against, with good serologic responses to sheep-labeled vaccines.76 In 2007, Dubovi reported on the testing of 12,000 alpaca samples submitted to Cornell University for BVDV testing.81 These samples revealed a 0.15% prevalence of persistent infection with serum-neutralizing antibodies present in 14% of 268 samples submitted for serology. Persistent infection, pyrexia, ill thrift, abortions, and stillbirths have been associated with BVDV infection in camelids.47, 50, 51 Although disease has not been successfully created experimentally,49 it is believed that persistently infected crias are the greatest source of infection and, as such, should be euthanized. The study of 43 strains of BVDV isolated from alpacas in a large geographic area showed that 42 of 43 were genetically similar, falling into one of two groups. That these strains could potentially be traced to a common origin makes testing and elimination of persistently infected animals the highest priority for control.81 Vaccination of camelids against BVDV is not currently recommended because of potential interference with diagnostic testing81 and lack of efficacy or safety information.",

In a serologic survey of camelids in northern Colorado in 2003, 73% (27 of 37) were seropositive, with a morbidity rate of 8.2%. The overall rate of mortality was 5.5%, with a case fatality rate of 66.7%.85 The use of equine-labeled vaccines in SACs has yielded mixed results. Ramsey and colleagues86 performed serologic testing on llamas and alpacas, administering doses every 3 weeks. No antibody responses were noted after one dose, but 75% of animals had a marked antibody response after the second and third doses. Duration of antibody, however, was short-lived, with significant decreases in titers by 10 weeks after the initial vaccine dose. In another study,87 vaccination of 84 llamas and alpacas with equine-labeled vaccine was determined to be safe and that three vaccinations at 3-week intervals resulted in virus-neutralizing titers similar to horses receiving two doses, with titers persisting for greater than 40 weeks. Combining the information gathered between these two studies, vaccination against West Nile virus should begin 2 to 3 months before the start of vector season, and boosters every 2 to 3 months should be considered. Because of this intense and expensive vaccination schedule, many farms have elected not to vaccinate the entire herd against West Nile virus, or have chosen to only vaccinate highly valuable individuals in endemic areas. It is not known how annual revaccination should be scheduled, but it should probably occur 3 to 6 weeks before peak exposure.87\n",

Passive immunity may be attained in camelid neonates by the use of active dam immunization or cria monoclonal antibody administration at birth against E. coli, rotavirus, and coronavirus.

Product chemical characteristics, concentration, contact-time, temperature, pH, water content and hardness, and the amount of organic debris present are essential determinants to the success of disinfection procedures.41 Sodium hypochlorite (household bleach, NaOCl, readily available as 5.25% or 12.75%) at a sufficient concentration, contact time, and temperature combination is effective against bacterial and viral agents, but not cryptosporidium oocysts.45 Sodium hypochlorite is cost effective and environmentally safe; however, it is rapidly inactivated by the presence of organic debris.38 Because of its acidity (pH = 6), it is usually corrosive to metals.45 At room temperature, recommended concentrations of this product in human environments range from 500 ppm (1:100 of 5.25% household bleach), with a 10-minute contact time, to 5,000 ppm (1:32 dilution of 5.25% bleach), with a 1-minute contact time.45 For viruses in veterinary hospitals and kennels, a recommended dilution of household bleach is 1:32 (0.175% NaOCl) at room temperature, with a 10-minute contact time.93 Other chemical disinfectants, such as quaternary ammonium, are effective against a wide range of bacteria, including Salmonella spp, some viruses, and fungi, and have a high long-lasting surface activity, even in the presence of organic material.28, 91 Peroxygen disinfectants are bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal and have minimal adverse effects on the animals and their environment. In one study investigating the effectiveness of directed misting application of 4% peroxymonosulfate disinfectant in a large animal veterinary hospital, effective disinfection of surface areas was obtained as bacterial counts (Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium) were reduced by more than 99.9999%.94 Phenolic disinfectants have prolonged antibacterial and antiviral activity, especially on porous surfaces. However, because of its toxicity to human beings and animals,91 its use is not recommended on SAC operations.",

All animals present on the farm, including newborn crias, should have a unique identification. Electronic identification using an intradermic microchip has gained significant popularity over the last decade. Moreover, llamas and alpacas can be officially registered either through the International Lama Registry (ILR) or the Alpaca Registry Incorporated (ARI). Using DNA technology, ARI and ILR validate the parentage of animals submitted for pedigree registration. Once an alpaca's or a llama's parentage has been validated, the respective registry issues a registration certificate that provides known lineage and assigns a unique number to each animal. Most regional and national shows, sales, and other events require that participating alpacas and llamas be registered. Registered animals have enhanced value, as their pedigrees are recorded and more informed breeding choices can be made because their lineage can be traced. Although currently on a voluntary basis, SACs are also eligible for registration through the National Animal Identification System.",

It takes such an instance to bring about awareness of camelid owners to the need of designing a herd-health program. Veterinarians, however, have unique training and qualifications in population medicine, which make them more than qualified to assist farms in the design and execution of preventative medicine plans. It is therefore recommended that camelid owners, in conjunction with their veterinarians, implement herd-health and biosecurity plans tailored for their operations. This may mean changing some existing practices and perhaps adding to the farm with quarantine or hospital facilities. The benefits of avoiding the introduction of disease far outweigh any short- or long-term cost and inconveniences of implementing such a program and changes.",
