In a recent review on the psychological impact of quarantine periods, depressive symptoms, acute stress, post-traumatic stress, anger or insomnia are reported. Among the stressors that contribute negatively during quarantine are its duration, fear of infection, loss of activity, lack of information or supplies (Brooks et al., 2020). Besides causing an emotional impact in people affected, COVID-19 pandemic could specially affect people with previous mental health conditions, resulting in relapses or worsening of an already existing mental health condition because of high susceptibility to stress compared with the general population (Yao et al., 2020). In the current pandemic, poor sleep quality, depressive or anxious symptoms were reported by Chinese general population (Huang and Zhao, 2020).",

The patient does not express fear of COVID-19 infection and yet reports that she cannot bear isolation. After seven days of isolation, on March 14th, B. began to show irritability, insomnia, and disorganized and aggressive behavior towards family members. In this relapse, she started to break the confinement, leaving her room and trying to go out the home ensuring that the virus did not affect her and that she had to leave. That situation endangered both the family and other members of the community. Finally, it was necessary to perform a psychiatric admission to contain and control the relapse.",
