            "text": "The genomic RNAs of plant RNA viruses are usually capable of directly expressing at least a portion of their genetic information through translation (Davies and Hull, 1982) . However, they are subject to the usual constraints imposed upon the translation of eucaryotic mRNAs. In general, only the reading frame starting nearest the 5' end of the mRNA is available for translation (Kozak, 1981 (Kozak, , 1984 , so that open reading frames and initiation codons nearer the 3' end of a polycistronic mRNA cannot be expressed directly. A common strategy adopted by these viruses is to express internal and 3'-terminal genes by means of subgenomic RNAs which are derived from, and 3'-coterminal with, the genomic RNAs. These subgenomic RNAs are used to express structural (coat protein) genes for many plant RNA viruses (reviewed by Davies and Hull, 1982; Bruening, 1981) . Animal RNA viruses commonly employ subgenomic RNAs to express both structural and nonstructural genes, e.g., the 26 S RNA of the alphaviruses (Sawicki et ak, 1978; Riedel et uL, 1982) , the mRNAs derived from RNAs 7 and 8 of influenza virus (Lamb and Choppin, 1983) and the mRNAs of the coronaviruses (Siddell et al, 1982) . At least one plant viral gene for a nonstructural protein, the ilf, 30,000 protein encoded by tobacco mosaic virus (TMV RNA, is also expressed by a subgenomic mRNA (Hirth and Richards, 1981) . Hunter et al. (1983) have shown the existence of a fam-ily of 3'-coterminal subgenomic RNAs which are capable in vitro of expressing the carboxyterminal regions of this TMV reading frame to give related proteins differing at their amino termini. It is still unknown whether this pattern also applies to other genes of TMV or other viruses, although other subgenomic RNAs have been detected for TMV (Goelet and Karn, 1982; Palukaitis et al, 1983) . It is also not known whether the multipartite plant RNA viruses use subgenomic RNAs to express genes other than for the coat protein, but Bol et aL, (1976) observed such possible subgenomic RNAs from alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV).",

RNA 2 encodes a polypeptide of molecular weight 94,333, which must correspond to the in vitro translation product (estimated &l, 110,000) and is encoded by 83% of the RNA. RNA 3 is dicistronic; the 5'-terminal gene encodes the 3a protein of 333 amino acids (calculated iW, 36,700) and the 3'terminal gene encodes the coat protein of 236 amino acids (calculated ilf, 26,200) .

To recover RNAs derived from RNA 1, hybrid selection was performed using a mixture of clones Rl(-)1, Rl(-)3, and Rl(-)5 (which are located, respectively, 2187 to 2303, 1225 to 1389, and 960 to 1161 nucleotides from the 3' end of RNA 1; see Fig. 1 ). RNAs derived from RNA 2 were selected by hybridization to clone R2(-)5, located from 600 to 816 nucleotides from the 3' end of this RNA (Fig. 1) . These two samples were then analyzed in adjacent tracks on the same 1.5% agarose gel (Fig.  2 , tracks c and d). After transfer to nitrocellulose filters, the RNAs were probed with [32P]cDNA to clone R3'com(+) whose insert corresponds to the extreme 3' 145 nucleotides of the CMV genomic RNAs that are common to all genomic RNAs (Symons, 1979) . The minor RNA species of over 1000 nucleotides (track a) or over 750 nucleotides (track f) in length were confirmed as distinct RNAs derived from, and 3'-coterminal with, RNA 1 (track c) and RNA 2 (track d), respectively. The major anomalous bands (corresponding to stained CMV RNAs) mentioned above were eliminated by this approach except for the 750 nucleotide band which was recovered by hybrid selection (track d) and must therefore be an abundant, specific RNA derived from RNA 2. Although the RNA sample in track d ( fig. 2) was contaminated with small amounts of RNA 1, and presumably of its related RNAs, the latter were present in amounts too low to affect the observed RNA pattern. The many shorter, 3'-coterminal RNAs may have arisen through specific nicking of the genomic RNAs, e.g., in the virion, rather than during their replication. There would then exist corresponding families of RNA fragments 5'-coterminal with the genomic RNAs. In order to characterize such putative RNAs, they were hybrid selected from total CMV RNA using minus clones Rl(-)1 (RNA 1) or R2(-)l (RNA 2), which are nearest the 5' ends of these RNAs, and analyzed using [32P]cDNA probes from clones R1(+)2 (Fig. 2, track  b) and R2(+)2 (Fig. 2, track e) , respectively. Both probes hybridized with the 3'-coterminal RNAs over about 2500 nucleotides in length, as expected, but showed different patterns for the smaller RNAs: about three RNAs of 1200 to 1500 nucleotides were present in the RNA 1 sample (track b), whereas there were about 10 from 800 to 1700 nucleotides in the RNA 2 sample (track e). Although these smaller RNAs do not appear to correspond to those expected if specific nicking is the cause of the 3'-coterminal subgenomic RNA patterns, it is possible that such nicking may occur more than once per molecule near the 5' end, resulting in no simple pair of related 5' and 3' segments. Hence, the situation with regard to specific 5'4erminal fragments was not clear and further work concentrated on the 3'-coterminal RNA fragments. The patterns of the RNA species derived from either RNA 1 or RNA 2 were reproducible, irrespective of the host-cucumber or N. clevelundii-from which the virus was obtained.",

The mRNA for the M,. 17,000 polypeptide was selected by hybridization to DNA from clone R2(-)5 located 600 to 816 nucleotides from the 3' end of RNA 2 (Fig.   5 , tracks a and j), but not from clone R2(-)3 (813 to 1015 nucleotides from the 3' end) (Fig. 5b, track i) . The only open reading frame apparently available for the M, 17,000 protein corresponds to the carboxyterminal portion of the long open reading frame traversing RNA 2. This runs from an AUG codon 852 nucleotides from the 3' end of RNA 2 to the UGA codon at 426 nucleotides to produce a polypeptide of calculated size M, 16,008 (Rezaian et ak, 1984) . It would thus be encoded by the SSO-nucleotide RNA. We would expect this RNA to hybridize inefficiently to clone R2(-)3, since the overlap would be only about 70 nucleotides. The cDNA probe from clone R2(+)4 (which is complementary to clone R2(-)3) hybridized very poorly to this RNA (Fig. 2 , track f). All these observations are consistent with the conclusion that the SO-nucleotide RNA is the mRNA for the M, 17,000 polypeptide. The next largest open reading frame on RNA 2 encodes a polypeptide of 100 amino acids (calculated M, ll,OOO), starting 627 nucleotides from the 3' end. This could be translated from the '750 nucleotide RNA (i.e., from the 3'-coterminal component if there is a mixture in this band) and may therefore be present below the M, 17,000 translation product (Fig. 5, track a) . The variation in produc-tion of some polypeptides (e.g., those of M, 23,000 to M, 60,000) may be due to competition in different subgenomic RNA fractions.",

The results in Fig. 4 showed that at least some of the translation products (Mr 30,000, M, 43,000, and M,. 48,000) of the 3'-coterminal subgenomic RNAs were produced by RNAs shorter than 1800 nucleotides.

By the same analysis, the larger proteins (over iW, 50,000) would also share their carboxytermini with the iW, 110,791 protein and possess staggered aminotermini.",

The reproducible patterns of discrete species obtained by Northern analysis of encapsidated RNA argue that these RNAs are significant, for they show differences specific to the genomic RNA from which they were derived. Furthermore, at least some are active in vitro mRNAs, and they have also been detected in particulate fraction RNA extracted from plants. These observations suggest that at least some may be genuine subgenomic mRNAs, produced during the viral RNA replication cycle rather than by subsequent degradation. The critical tests of this proposition are to detect the translation products in viwo and to demonstrate their synthesis from the subgenomic RNAs of plant polyribosomes.",

If subgenomic RNAs indeed allow CMV to differentially express portions of these genes in vivo, they may also be instrumental in its evolution. First, they would afford the virus greater flexibility in responding to different hosts or conditions. Furthermore, they could allow the virus to profit from differing mutation rates along individual genes, by allowing expression of regions toward the carboxyterminal independently of the aminoterminal regions of a gene. It is striking that regions of the genes on CMV RNAs 1 and 2 contain amino acid sequences homologous with corresponding RNAs of brome mosaic virus (BMV), AlMV and TMV (Rezaian et al, 1984 (Rezaian et al, , 1985 . Some of these homologous sequences are located in the aminoterminal part of the gene on RNA 1, but most are concentrated in the carboxyterminal 281 amino acids of this gene.

            "text": "residues from the carboxyterminus of the gene on CMV RNA 2. The homologous sequences in the carboxyterminal regions of the CMV RNA genes would therefore be expressed by the translation products of the 3'-coterminal subgenomic RNAs. An exception is translation of the M, 17,000 protein from RNA 2 since the carboxyterminal 145 amino acids from CMV RNA 2 show very little homology to the carboxyterminal stretch of the BMV gene and none to that of AlMV or TMV. The CMV M, 17,000 translation product therefore appears to be a polypeptide unique to CMV.These homologous regions in corresponding genes of several plant RNA viruses may be responsible for fundamental functions, e.g., RNA replication, whereas the divergent regions may control specific host interactions.New viral genes, with the same fundamental function, but altered host specificities, could result from the linking of subgenomic RNAs from one virus with those from another, upon coinfection of a single host. It is therefore of great interest whether other RNA viruses generate similar families of subgenomic RNAs. Crude fractionation, followed by in vitro translation, of the encapsidated RNA from lucerne transient streak virus (Morris-Krsinich and Foster, 1983) , solanum nodiflorum mottle virus (Kiberstis and Zimmern, 19&t) , tobacco etch virus (Otal and Hari, 1983) , and turnip crinkle virus (Dougherty and Kaesberg, 1981) has disclosed products (other than the coat protein) whose mRNAs were smaller than the genomic RNA.",
