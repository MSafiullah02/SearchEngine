As predicted, a multiple regression analysis revealed that the fear of contracting HIV/AIDS through casual contact was a significant predictor of both men's and women's willingness to interact with people living with HIV/AIDS. Attitudes toward homosexuality were also a significant predictor of attitudes toward people living with HIV/AIDS among women, who generally have a low risk of contracting the disease in Western societies. These results indicate that attitudes toward people with a serious illness may be strongly related to the perceived risk of contracting the disease.",

Unfavorable attitudes may lead to discrimination in education and employment, and affect public support for health programs. There are two possible explanations for such attitudes that have been explored: fear of contagion and social stigma. Thus, unfavorable attitudes toward people living with HIV/AIDS may result from concern about contracting the disease or the association of HIV/AIDS with homosexuality (Bishop, Alva, Cantu, & Rittiman, 1991; Pryor, Reeder, Vinacco, & Kott, 1989) .",

For example, people tend to be less sympathetic toward people with an illness if they are believed to have been responsible for its occurrence. In the case of HIV/AIDS, the disease has become associated with homosexuality and sexual promiscuity in Western societies (Pryor et al., 1989) . Crandall et al. (1997) argued that in the case of a serious disease (e.g., HIV/AIDS), attitudes toward people with the illness will be based largely on concerns about the disease, such as the perceived risk of contracting it. With a mild illness, however, the extent to which the disease is associated with deviant social groups will increase negative attitudes toward people with the illness. For example, Bishop et al. (1991) reported that the stated willingness of their study participants to interact with a person with a fictitious illness was related strongly to the perceived contagiousness of the disease. The association of the disease with homosexuality only affected participants' willingness to interact when the disease was described as not being contagious.",

Men also expressed less favorable attitudes toward people living with HIV/AIDS in terms of expressions of sympathy and their willingness to have social contact with them (Heaven et al., 1990) . These findings are consistent with the perception that men face a greater risk of contracting HIV/AIDS than do women. However, it should be noted that the effect sizes of these differences were small (.04-.10).",

If the risk of contracting the disease is regarded as high, attitudes toward people with the illness may be based largely on fear of contracting it. When the disease does not appear to be contagious, the characteristics of the people who are affected by the illness may influence attitudes toward them. These findings represent a refinement of Crandall et al.'s (1997) model, which may provide a more comprehensive framework for understanding public attitudes toward people with a serious illness (e.g., those affected by the 2003 outbreak of the SARS virus) and allow health professionals to develop intervention programs that are appropriate to the perceived risk of contracting a disease within the community. At the same time, support for the model would be strengthened by a replication of this study with a sample of the population that was based more broadly, particularly in terms of age and educational background.",
