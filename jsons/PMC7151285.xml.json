Several explanations could account for this unexpected trend. One possible explanation is that by directly addressing COVID-19, participants from the FL may have felt a greater sense of control of their situation; control in the workplace is thought to be a major driver of engagement and important for avoiding burnout.(22, 25, 28) Those working in their usual wards may have perceived less control over new policies and procedures enacted to keep staff and patients safe, and in contrast to facing COVID-19 head-on, these workers may have had a sense that the virus could impact their workplace at any time, regardless of those policies. Additionally, cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to viral infection, and the COVID-19 pandemic has frequently necessitated suspension of cancer treatment and clinical trials;(4, 29) these situations may add additional workplace stress to oncology professionals working in their UW.(13, 30, 31)",

Beyond the FL, the working life of physicians and nurses is highly disrupted even in their usual hospital wards. New policies and procedures, the stress of both staff and patients, and the prospect that infected individuals (staff or patients) could be identified in the workplace at any time may be sources of burnout for non-front line staff. Given the known detrimental impact of burnout on patient care and health care worker well-being,(34, 35, 36, 37, 38) our results suggest that the well-being of staff working in their usual workplace may be negatively impacted by the pandemic, and is deserving of future attention and additional research.",
