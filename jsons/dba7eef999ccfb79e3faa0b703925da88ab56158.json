The theory is widely recognized and has been applied in various ways, but little work has been done to summarize and synthesize the application of TTF in literature. The aim of this study is to identify and summarize the focus areas of studies that applied TTF, the environment in which it was applied, and the technologies which were considered by conducting a scoping review. It was found that applied studies focused primarily on generating theory or assessing certain realworld phenomena; was applied in a wide range of environments with the majority being in healthcare; and considered various technologies, with an increasing number of studies focusing on mobile technology. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of TTF applications and assists in framing future research to further analyze TTF studies.",

TTF provides a means to quantify the effectiveness of technology in an organizations [6] . In 2012, Furneaux [7] identified the \"notable increase in the use of TTF theory\". This trend has continued over the years, with both an increase in the yearly number of documents published as well as in the range of environments which the theory is used, as discussed in this paper.",

Although the intention was to define screening criteria in a manner that would ensure reliability and replicability of the screening process, the authors acknowledge that Despite the limitations of the study, the findings of this study are valuable and further assists in framing future research on the application of TTF. The different studies which apply TTF may be further analyzed to determine trends in the methodologies followed within and/or across the different application categories, environments and technologies. This in turn may be used to provide guidelines in the quantitative measurement of different TTF constructs, given a specific intention for, and context of, use.
