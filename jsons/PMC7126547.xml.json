BDV provides an important paradigm for the investigation of the mechanisms and consequences of viral persistence in the CNS. Studies on this viral system will contribute to the elucidation of immune-mediated pathological events involved in virally induced neurological disease, as well as the mechanisms whereby viruses induce neurobehavioral disturbances in the absence of the hallmarks of cytolysis and inflammation. Moreover, serological data and recent molecular epidemiological studies indicate that BDV can infect humans, and is possibly associated with certain neuropsychiatric disorders. Based on its unique biological and genetic characteristics, BDV represents the prototype of a new family of viruses. Consequently, investigations on BDV may provide new insights into virus\u2013cell interactions in the CNS. The prospect of finding other BDV-like viruses, some of them possibly clinically relevant, provides further impetus for the study of this novel neurotropic infectious agent.",

BD was recognized as a sporadically occurring encephalopathy that affected horses and sheep in Southeastern Germany. The disease owes its name after the town of Borna, in Saxony, where many horses from a cavalry regiment died during an epidemic in 1895. Early studies showed that BD could be transmitted by using brain homogenates from diseased horses, demonstrating the infectious nature of the disease 101, 125, 155, 188. Sensitivity to detergents, ultraviolet light, and organic solvents, together with filtration studies suggested that BD was caused by an enveloped virus, the Borna disease virus.",

The adaptation of BDV to small laboratory animals, such as the rabbit and the rat, has facilitated more detailed studies on BDV pathogenesis and the neurobehavioral alterations accompanying the infection.",

The establishment of persistently infected cell lines and the use of molecular genetic approaches has enabled the recent progress in the molecular characterization of this infectious agent. These studies have demonstrated that BDV is a nonsegmented, negative-stranded (NNS) RNA virus 43, 50, 123, 216. The cloning and complete sequencing of two BDV isolates has uncovered the genomic organization of BDV 31, 44, 48, 183. The genome is about 8.9 kb long, with complementary 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 untranslated regions at its termini (Fig. 1). The antigenomic polarity contains information for at least five open reading frames (ORF). Similarly to other members of the Mononegavirales, the genome can be divided in three main gene blocks: block 1 codes for the nucleoprotein and polymerase cofactors, represented by the BVp40 (ORF I) and BVp24 (ORF II) proteins of BDV; block 2 codes for the matrix and virus envelope proteins, whose likely counterparts in BDV are the BVp16 (ORF III) and BVp56 (ORF IV) proteins, respectively; and block 3 codes for the viral polymerase, identified as ORF V in the BDV genome.",

            "text": "The BDV nucleoprotein (NP) BVp40 is present at high levels in infected cells and tissues. This protein is likely encoded in two isoforms of 38 and 40 kDa 81, 94, 165. This may be related to the presence of two in-frame initiation codons in the BVp40 gene sequence. The BVp24 protein is acidic, with a high Ser/Thr content and is phosphorylated at serine residues 94, 211, 212. These features are consistent with the phosphoprotein (P) transcriptional activator found in other NNS RNA viruses. The transcription unit encoding BVp24 can also direct the synthesis of a polypeptide of 10 kDa (BVp10). Recent data from our laboratory indicate that BVp10 is present in infected cells. The ORF encoding BVp10 starts 46 nucleotides upstream from BVp24 and overlaps, in a different frame, with the 213 first nucleotides of ORF II (Fig. 1). The function of BVp10 is presently unknown. A similar situation has been described for the P gene of Sendai virus [46] and vesicular stomatitis virus [202]. BDV ORF III (BVp16) likely represents the BDV matrix (M) protein. In contrast to other NNS RNA viruses, BDV M protein is glycosylated and data suggest that it might be present at the surface of the virion envelope [111]. ORF IV is predicted to encode for a polypeptide of 56 kDa (BVp56). Sequence features suggest that this protein is a viral surface glycoprotein (GP). Recent reports have provided experimental evidence that BVp56 is involved in virus entry 74, 185. BVp56 is present as two forms in BDV-infected cells [74]. One form of approximately 84 kDa (GP-84) corresponds to the full-length product encoded by ORF IV and accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum. The molecular weight of this polypeptide, higher than 56 kDa, is due to glycosylation. A shorter product of 43 kDa (GP-43) corresponds to the C-terminus of GP-84 and is generated via cleavage by the cellular protease furin [73]. Moreover, GP-43 is present at the surface of infected cells. Both GP-84 and GP-43 are associated with infectious virions. These features indicate a novel maturation pathway for a NNS RNA virus surface GP and, hence, for the assembly of BDV particles [74]. ORF V is capable of encoding a polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 180 kDa, whose deduced amino acid sequence displays strong homology with the NNS RNA viral polymerases (L protein family) [44]. This homology is particularly high in the case of the conserved putative catalytic domain.",

This extraordinary sequence conservation, uncommon for an animal NNS RNA virus, may indicate that there is a prevalent and stable species of BDV in nature, with the ability to infect several animal species, including humans. The reasons for the great stability of the BDV genome are unknown. Interestingly, sequence analysis reveals that the L proteins of BDV and Sonchus yellow net virus, a plant nucleorhabdovirus that also replicates in the nucleus, are the most distantly related to the L proteins from animal rhabdoviruses, raising intriguing questions about the evolutionary origins of BDV [44].",

The concurrent use of such a diversity of strategies for the regulation of gene expression is unique among known NNS RNA viruses. Taken altogether, this has led to the proposal that BDV represents the prototype of a new taxon of NNS RNA viruses 48, 183.",

Contact experiments have suggested that healthy carrier animals might represent a source of infection, because the disease can be transmitted between horses and sheep living in the same stable [172]. Oral infection has been achieved in several animal species, suggesting that the virus could also be transmitted by the oral/gastric route 83, 130.

After initial replication in the neurons located at the site of entry, BDV likely migrates intraaxonally in an anterograde or retrograde direction towards the CNS. The pathway of dissemination of BDV following intranasal inoculation of the rat has been thoroughly analyzed 140, 190. The virus initially replicates in the neuroreceptor cells of the olfactory epithelium. Subsequently, the virus gains access to the cells of the main olfactory bulb, including the tufted and mitral cells, as well as the periglomular cells, the granule cells, and the short axon neurons of the internal granular layer of the main olfactory bulb. Following invasion of these sites, the virus will reach the efferent targets of the main olfactory bulb, like the anterior olfactory nucleus, the prepiriform cortex, the olfactory tubercle, the olfactory amygdala, and the entorhinal cortex. Further spread is then possible into numerous diencephalic and telencephalic areas, through polysynaptic neuronal connections. Likewise, experimental infection into the foot pad of a rat results in a retrograde transport of BDV, through the sciatic nerve, and then from neuron to neuron into the CNS [36]. Moreover, evidence of oral infection suggests that the nerve endings innervating intestinal regions are suitable for uptake of the virus and its transport to the CNS [130]. Alternatively, oral uptake of BDV may also result in the infection of the gut epithelium. The virus could then gain access to the surrounding lymphoid tissue, infect target blood cells, and be transported by the bloodstream into the CNS. The location of the initial site of entry will condition the incubation period preceding the onset of overt BD, reflecting the time required for viral transport into the brain.",

The stratified distribution of viral markers coincides with that of some excitatory amino acids receptors, in particular the glutamate receptors [78]. Also, specific neurotransmitter pathways are affected by BDV infection 122, 198, 200. This could indicate that these receptors are used by the virus or by viral RNP for their transneuronal transfer. Besides neurons, glial cells are also permissive for BDV. Virus antigen and RNA appear rather early in astrocytes, followed by oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, as well as Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system [37]. It is probable that glial cells become secondarily infected after BDV release by the neurons. In agreement with this hypothesis, Purkinje cells are the only cells in the cerebellum containing BDV antigen early after infection. Later on, glial cells also become infected [8]. This is also reminiscent of findings described in other biphasic CNS diseases caused by RNA viruses, such as Theiler\u2019s virus infection of the mouse. In this case, the acute phase is characterized by an active viral replication in neurons. Subsequently, the virus accesses glial cells in the spinal cord, which is required for the establishment of persistence 97, 99.",

However, BDV may also replicate in the retina without exerting any overt neuronal damage [84]. The brain regions most affected by the inflammatory response are the olfactory bulb, the hippocampus, and the caudate nucleus [102]. Inflammation is moderate in the spinal cord and absent in the cerebellum [101]. The colocalization of cell infiltrates with sites of high viral expression suggests that the inflammatory reaction is due to the presence of viral antigen.",

The onset of clinical signs, including movement abnormalities, aggressive and hyperactive behavior, coincides with the appearance of an inflammatory reaction in the brain that reaches its maximum of severity between days 30 and 40 after infection. Parts of the limbic system, the cerebral cortex, and the olfactory bulb exhibit the strongest inflammatory reaction, which is limited to the gray matter. Some level of inflammation is also observed in the basal ganglia, the diencephalon, and to a lesser degree, in the midbrain and medulla. This extensive inflammatory reaction leads to neuronal destruction that in some cases may cause a hydrocephalus. As with the infection of horses, the cerebellum rarely shows signs of inflammation.",

However, adoptive transfer of spleen cells from BD rats into BDV-infected immunosuppressed recipients results in inflammatory changes in the brain and concomitant BD [151]. In contrast, transfer of immune serum does not lead to disease, demonstrating that antibodies are not involved in the immunopathological process induced by BDV [90]. Studies on PTI-NB rats provide further evidence for the role of the cell-mediated immune response in the development of BD. BDV replicates in the thymus of PTI-NB rats [176]. As with other viruses, early expression of viral antigens in the thymus can promote clonal deletion of T-cells that would normally respond to the infectious agent [96]. Thus, the lack of BDV-specific precursor T-cells in the spleen and lymph nodes likely explains the absence of an inflammatory reaction in the CNS of PTI-NB rats.",

The role of CD4+ T-cells in BD was supported by the isolation of a BDV-specific CD4+ T-cell line with the ability to induce disease upon adoptive transfer into BDV-infected immunosuppressed recipients 167, 169. Adoptive transfer of these CD4+ T-cells into immunocompetent uninfected rats did not cause encephalitis or disease, demonstrating that this BDV-specific T-cell line was not encephalitogenic per se. Recent evidence indicates that a direct cytotoxic activity of CD4+ T-cells plays a rather limited, if any, role in BD [197]. Although BDV-specific CD4+ T-cells can exhibit major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II restricted cytotoxic activity in vitro\n167, 168, there is not, however, convincing evidence of such an activity in vivo\n162, 197. It should be noted that CD4+ T-cells may acquire cytotoxic activity during in vitro cultivation [65]. In addition, there is no evidence of MHC class II expression in neurons, the main cell type destroyed by the inflammatory response 38, 167, 206. Furthermore, CD4+ T-cells are present predominantly in perivascular cuffs, whereas few reach the brain parenchyma, where the immune-mediated damage occurs 20, 197. Besides, adoptive transfer of noncytolytic virus-specific CD4+ cells into BDV-infected immunosuppressed recipients can lead to the development of BD only if CD8+ T-cells enter the brain [163]. Development of disease in these recipients can be prevented by treatment with monoclonal antibodies that specifically block CD8+ T-cell activity 163, 208. Conversely, treatment of BDV-infected rats with anti-CD4+ antibodies does not effectively prevent inflammation and tissue damage in the CNS [162].",

The existence of the blood\u2013brain barrier significantly restricts the degree of immunological surveillance and the vigor of the immune response in the CNS. However, activated virus-specific CTL can access the brain parenchyma. BDV-mediated induction of MHC class I expression on neurons can then be detrimental for the host by allowing destruction by CTL. Furthermore, this BDV-specific CTL activity is unable to control the infection and viral load is not significantly decreased after regression of the immune response.

Studies on PTI-NB rats have suggested that BDV can induce a selective damage on specific neuronal populations [9]. However, this restricted neuronal degeneration is not considered as a \u201cclassical\u201d cytopathic effect, but is rather due to an interference of BDV infection with the postnatal development of CNS areas that experience extensive postnatal maturation.",

The cerebellum developmental arrest has been attributed in these cases to either an immune-mediated, or a virus-induced lysis of the dividing immature cerebellar granule cells. The characteristics of BDV-induced cerebellar hypoplasia have been detailed in a recent report [8]. The arrest of cerebellar development occurs between 7 and 14 days postinfection. This coincides with a progressive atrophy of the granule cell layers. In contrast to the other viral systems mentioned above, the granule cells are not infected by BDV. Purkinje cells are the predominant, if not the only, cell type infected in the cerebellum at the early stages of its development [8]. Therefore, it appears that BDV-induced cerebellar damage is caused by different mechanisms than those proposed with other perinatal virus infections. Evidence indicates that Purkinje cells play a main role in supporting the multiplication, maturation, and migration of the granular cells [195]. This role could be altered by BDV infection. The massive astrocytosis observed in PTI-NB rats might also be involved in the cessation of granule cell migration, especially given the key role of astrocytes in providing the physical track upon which the granule cells migrate [82], as well as neurotrophic support to surrounding cells [60].",

To separate these two events, Morimoto et al. used dexamethasone treatment of rats after BDV infection [141]. This synthetic glucocorticoid effectively prevented inflammation in the CNS of BDV-infected rats. However, several proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 were still induced in the brains of dexamethasone-treated rats, suggesting that these might have been produced by CNS resident cells. However, dexamethasone treatment of rats per se may have a profound action on the cytokine expression pattern of CNS cells [181].

            "text": "Perinatal BDV infection of the rat provides a system to dissect the elements involved in BDV-induced alterations of CNS homeostasis without inflammation. So far, very few studies have addressed such questions in this model. Recently, a BDV-induced upregulation of tissue factor (TF) was demonstrated in the CNS of PTI-NB rats [75]. TF, a transmembrane receptor, is the primary initiator of the coagulation protease cascade that results in the generation of the protease thrombin [62]. Besides, TF appears to have pleiotropic roles and has been implicated in signal transduction, angiogenesis and brain function 33, 61, 175, 228. In the CNS, TF is primarily, if not solely, produced by astrocytes [59]. TF expression is markedly increased during persistent infection with BDV, both in vivo and in vitro\n[75] (Fig. 2). This upregulation is due to BDV infection of astrocytes, and is mediated by an increased transcription of the TF gene and a stabilization of TF mRNA. The significance of this finding is still a matter of speculation. However, because this phenomenon occurs without hemorrhage, inflammation, or disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier, it raises interesting questions about the consequences of TF upregulation and suggests that TF may fulfill functions other than hemostasis in the CNS. There is increasing evidence that proteins of the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems may function in the CNS independent from blood clotting, such as regulating normal brain development and defending the brain against damage caused by stroke, trauma, and other injuries [131]. Any imbalance in the protease activities may contribute to neuronal damage. TF is the primary initiator of the thrombin activation system, a protease that has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease 131, 135. Interestingly, thrombin is predominantly expressed by dopaminergic neurons of the mesencephalon [221]. Therefore, this may suggest a link between TF upregulation and the dopaminergic abnormalities observed in BD rats (see section 3.5). These findings suggest that upregulation of TF expression due to BDV infection may play an important role in the CNS response to this viral assault and perhaps also in the BDV-mediated disturbances of CNS function.

Strain specific differences in the susceptibility to disease have also been observed in mice. Thus, although BDV induces encephalitis to a similar degree in MRL/+ and MRL/lpr mice, only MRL/+ mice develop behavioral abnormalities [177]. This dissociation between inflammation and symptoms indicating the onset of the disease may reflect differences in the composition and immunological properties of the cellular infiltrate [177]. The host genetic background likely contributes to these differences. Alternatively, host factors could also modulate the vulnerability of brain cells to the inflammatory reaction [78].",

Tree shrews (Tupaia glis) are phylogenetically classified at the root of the primates and exhibit a complex behavioral repertoire [201]. Tree shrews inoculated with BDV develop a persistent infection that is frequently associated with behavioral disorders. Interestingly, housing conditions have a strong influence on the behavioral manifestations after infection. Only a small number of animals kept in isolation show behavioral abnormalities, whereas all paired animals display profound sociosexual behavioral disturbances. These include a tendency to accept partners more quickly, a need for increased body contact, as well as a reversal in the role of the sex partners and an impaired breeding behavior of the females. Some animals kept in isolation also show neurological symptoms (Table 1). In these cases, an initial hyperactive phase, that coincides with the peak of the neurological symptoms, is followed by a phase of decline. All these animals recover, but relapse of clinical symptoms can occur in some cases. It is unknown why clinical symptoms are observed only in some animals, especially because all have comparable viral load in the brain and similar titers of serum antibodies to BDV [203]. The behavioral alterations exhibited by BDV-infected tree shrews are controlled by the limbic system and can be summarized as a disinhibition toward the environment [203]. Interestingly, evidence indicates that virus-specific lesions in neurons of the limbic system represent a hallmark of BDV infection.",

            "text": "Behavioral disturbances associated with BDV infection have been thoroughly studied in the rat model. Intracerebral inoculation of the adult immunocompetent rat causes a persistent infection that is associated with the previously described immune-mediated biphasic neurobehavioral disease (see section 3.2.2). BD rats develop a progressive movement and behavior disorder, accompanied by hyperactivity. Several studies have focused on the pharmacology and neurochemistry of this hyperactive syndrome 198, 199, 200. Based on similarities with the behavioral disturbances caused in rats by neurotoxic or electrolytic lesions in the frontal cortex or its catecholamine afferents [215], it has been proposed that BDV-induced disturbances might be due to alterations of the dopamine system. Dopaminergic activity is enhanced in the prefrontal cortex of BD rats, revealed by high levels of 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic acid, the primary dopamine metabolite. Yet, dopamine receptor density is not affected in the prefrontal cortex [199]. Analysis of dopamine receptor density in rostral striatal areas, such as the nucleus accumbens, revealed a loss of dopamine reuptake sites correlated with decreased numbers of D2 and D3 receptors binding sites [200]. The nucleus accumbens is a primary site of integration between limbic and motor information and has been involved in the control of motor, cognitive, emotional, and reward processes [119]. Thus, abnormalities in the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic network may constitute the neural substrate of hyperactivity in BD [200]. Furthermore, similarities between these alterations and those observed in manic depressive or schizophrenic patients 161, 187, 223 may be an important pathophysiologic feature linking the BD rat model to human psychiatric diseases. Besides dopamine, alterations in other neurotransmitter systems have also been described in BD rats and include changes in mRNA levels of cholecystokinin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and somatostatin [122].",

The correlation of cytokine levels in BD rat brains with the degree of inflammatory reaction and severity of neurological symptoms supports this hypothesis. It should be reminded that the hippocampus frequently harbors a high viral load 37, 78, 140, thus becoming a primary target for the virus-specific inflammatory reaction. This brain structure plays essential roles in governing emotion, learning and memory [10].

However, PTI-NB rats exhibit distinct cognitive, behavioral and physiological abnormalities (Table 1) 9, 57. PTI-NB rats show impaired cognitive functions in different learning paradigms, including spatial discrimination and discriminated avoidance tasks 9, 57. Results from open field and neophobia tests revealed emotional disturbances in PTI-NB rats, manifested as a reduced resting behavior and decreased anxiety. Moreover, these animals displayed hyperactivity when placed in a novel environment [9]. Reduced body weight and length were also observed in PTI-NB rats, compared to age- and sex-matched uninfected controls. Impaired growth did not seem to be related to disturbances in growth hormone physiology, because levels of growth hormone, insulin growth factor type 1, and glucose were unchanged in PTI-NB rats [9]. These differences in growth appeared only after weaning, suggesting that the feeding behavior might have been affected by perinatal BDV infection. In addition, PTI-NB rats exhibited an altered preference for a saline solution when it was paired with either water, saccharin, or quinine solutions [9]. The mechanisms underlying this altered salt taste preference are unknown. Disturbances in the postnatal maturation of the cerebellum and hippocampus induced by BDV, which have been reviewed above, probably contribute to the neurobehavioral abnormalities observed in these animals.",

Thus, factors such as the geographic area, the heterogeneity of diagnoses, and clinical status of patients may have significantly influenced these results. For example, a slightly higher percentage of seropositives is found in patients\u2019 sera derived from areas in southern Germany, where BDV is endemic in animals 12, 14, 173 (Table 2); (b) Differences in the experimental procedures used to detect antibodies to BDV in human sera may also have affected the results. In particular, the immunofluorescence assay used in many of these studies 25, 26, 27 is considered to be unreliable 110, 218. The use of immunofluorescence assays for BDV serology poses difficulties because of the very low BDV antibody titers in human sera [22]. Furthermore, sera from neuropsychiatric patients often contain autoantibodies that react with nuclear structures 67, 120, 194. Thus, the nuclear localization of BDV antigens in infected cells makes necessary the use of appropriate controls to discriminate between BDV-specific staining and nuclear staining due to autoantibodies. Increased specificity and sensitivity are now provided by Western blot assays that use either BDV-infected cell extracts 66, 218, or recombinantly expressed BDV antigens 108, 180. Interestingly, results from studies conducted using this improved serologic test have still shown a significantly higher seroprevalence in neuropsychiatric patients (6.5\u201330%) compared to nonpsychiatric control groups (0\u20131.4%) 66, 108, 180, 218.",

This finding led to the use of a similar approach to examine the prevalence of BDV in humans. Thus, BDV RNA was first detected in the PBMC from four out of six hospitalized psychiatric patients (inpatients) [29]. This initial study has been followed by more comprehensive molecular epidemiological investigations. BDV RNA prevalence of 37% (22 of 60) [108], or 10.9% (6 of 55) [95], has been documented in PBMC of Japanese neuropsychiatric inpatients. Studies on Japanese healthy blood donors revealed a viral prevalence of 4.6% (8 of 172) [108] and 0% (0 of 36) [95]. Studies on German neuropsychiatric patients revealed a BDV RNA prevalence in PBMC of 50% (13 of 26), whereas 0% (0 of 23) of normal controls were positive for viral RNA [180]. These studies have also shown that patients harboring detectable levels of viral RNA in their PBMC are frequently BDV seronegative; conversely, BDV-seropositive individuals have frequently nondetectable levels of viral RNA 29, 108, 180.",

In persistently infected rats, the prevalence of BDV-infected cells in PBMC has been estimated at 1 per 5 \u00d7 106 cells [176]. The need of highly sensitive RT-PCR procedures to detect BDV RNA in PBMC from humans or BDV-infected animals indicates an extremely low viral load in PBMC. However, some investigators have reported that 10 to 17% of the monocytes of BDV-positive patients express BDV antigens 28, 29. This would suggest that about 1% of the PBMC are infected with BDV. In this case, even assuming a very low viral load per cell, detection of BDV RNA should not require the use of nested RT-PCR. The reasons for this apparent discrepancy remain to be determined. Data from the rat model suggest that BDV is present in a very small fraction of circulating stromal cell precursors, rather than in the monocytes [176]. PBMC could have become infected during passage through the brain, or they may represent primary targets with the ability to spread the infection into the CNS, a situation that has been proposed for other neurotropic viruses 64, 149. Intravenous injection of rats with cell-free BDV is not followed by the establishment of a persistent infection [36]. This argues against cells within the PBMC being primary targets for BDV.",

These concerns can be addressed by following well-established guidelines to avoid contamination problems during RT-PCR assays 137, 180. Nevertheless, the low level of viral RNA in PBMC, close to the sensitivity threshold of nested RT-PCR, can hamper the reproducibility of results between laboratories [179].

Some investigators have used RT-PCR to search for BDV sequences in autopsy brain material from cases of schizophrenia and affective disorders 189, 192. These initial studies failed to detect BDV-positive samples. However, a recent study has documented the detection of BDV antigen and RNA in human autopsy brain samples [51] (Fig. 3). The initial selection of the cases analyzed in this study was based on histopathological features resembling those observed in chronically BDV-infected animals. In particular, damage to the hippocampus and astrocytosis were used as screening criteria. Among 600 autopsy cases examined, five were found with sclerosis of the hippocampus and astrocytosis as the main histopathological findings. These patients presented with a clinical history of mental disorders manifested as severe depression and memory loss. In four of these five patients, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed the presence of viral antigen and RNA in neurons and astrocytes within the hippocampal formation. In contrast, BDV markers were not found in control cases [51]. Detection of viral RNA required the use of nested RT-PCR, suggesting that failure to detect BDV RNA in previous studies, using single round RT-PCR, might have been related to lack of sensitivity. These findings demonstrate that BDV can persist in the human CNS, providing the basis for more comprehensive studies aimed at determining whether BDV persistence in the CNS is associated with specific human mental disorders.",

Moreover, findings in BDV-infected animals suggest that the biology of BDV is compatible with its potential role in these mental disorders [198]. BDV-infected animals display a diverse range of symptoms, including neurobehavioral alterations with cyclic episodes. The remarkable heterogeneity in disease phenotype associated with BDV infection depends on both host and viral factors, as well as other exogenous factors. Thus, stress can contribute to recurrent disease episodes in BDV chronically infected animals 83, 134.",

These affect several brain regions but are predominantly localized to medial temporal lobe structures. However, functional alterations suggest that the disease process may also affect other brain areas, involve integrative sensory function and motor coordination [227]. Abnormalities within the hippocampal formation are frequently observed in these disorders 3, 18, 191. Studies using high resolution volumetric magnetic resonance imaging have shown that affective disorders are associated with structural changes in the hippocampus [191]. It has been suggested that the long-term overexpression of glucocorticoids, frequently seen in patients with major depression, could cause degeneration of hippocampal neurons, which express high levels of glucocorticoids receptors [178]. In the case of schizophrenia, hippocampal alterations are thought to reflect an altered process of cell migration during brain development, possibly triggered by an early viral infection [18]. BDV has a predominant tropism for limbic system structures 37, 78, 140 and perinatal infection causes hippocampal damage. Interestingly, magnetic resonance imaging studies have suggested that cerebral abnormalities occur more frequently in BDV-seropositive psychiatric patients 11, 218. Moreover, PTI-NB rats display cerebellar hypoplasia. The cerebellum is linked with limbic structures through multisynaptic circuits, which have been implicated in mood regulation [196]. There is also evidence of a decreased size of the cerebellum in patients with affective disorders 63, 152, 220.",

Evidence suggests that the nose is a main site of virus entry in animals [172]. Sporadic evidence has suggested the possibility of transmission from BDV-infected animals to humans 14, 222. The close genetic relationship between BDV sequences derived from humans and animal strains provides support for this hypothesis. In this regard, it is of interest that domestic cats are susceptible to BDV, representing potential carriers of BDV 129, 145. The detection of BDV RNA in a significant percentage (4.2 to 5%) of blood donors\u2019 PBMC raises the concern of a possible transmission by blood transfusion [107]. As with other neurotropic viruses, a small number of BDV-infected cells present in a blood sample could reach the brain and establish a persistent infection within the CNS. Depending on the genetic susceptibility of the host and on viral factors, this persistent infection may have diverse clinical consequences, manifested after a variable period of incubation. One should keep in mind that stress, a common finding in psychiatric patients, can induce immunosuppression by altering glucocorticoids levels [144]. This, in turn, could enhance susceptibility to infectious agents, including BDV.",
