In the United States, acute gastroenteritis in children under five is responsible for approximately 300 deaths, 200,000 hospitalizations, and 1.5 million outpatient visits, an estimated $250 million in direct medical costs, and $1 billion in indirect medical costs [de Bruin et al., 2006; Churgay and Aftab, 2012].",

Rotavirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, norovirus, and sapovirus, have all been established as etiological agents of acute gastroenteritis in children [Hammond et al., 1981; Wilhelmi et al., 2003; Claas et al., 2005; Colomba et al., 2006; Unicef WHO, 2009; Churgay and Aftab, 2012; Chhabra et al., 2013; Payne et al., 2013]. Additionally, some clinical studies have suggested that coronaviruses may be a cause of acute gastroenteritis [Payne et al., 1986; van Maarseveen et al., 2010; Jev\u0161nik et al., 2013]. Clinical data indicates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) caused significant diarrhea [Booth et al., 2003; Choi et al., 2003; Hsu et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Hsueh et al., 2004; Grant et al., 2012].

Many laboratories use commercially available immunoassays for the diagnosis of rotavirus, norovirus, and adenovirus diseases; however, these tests are limited by their ability to detect a single viral pathogen at a time, poor sensitivity and specificity, and limited availability outside suspected outbreaks [de Bruin et al., 2006; Terletskaia\u2010Ladwig et al., 2007; Harris et al., 2009; Mans et al., 2010; Chhabra et al., 2013; Gautam et al., 2013].

Overall, 26% of all samples from children with gastrointestinal symptoms showed evidence of viral infection by RT\u2010PCR, similar to what has been reported in most studies using molecular techniques [Esper et al., 2010; Chhabra et al., 2013; Jev\u0161nik et al., 2013; Payne et al., 2013]. Of note, viral agents were not detected in 74% of samples, and few samples had bacterial agents identified, suggesting that diarrhea had a non\u2010infectious cause or was due to a pathogen not assessed in this study. Recently, Payne et al. prospectively evaluated the etiology of acute gastroenteritis in children less than 5 years of age for 12 months in three counties in the United States and found that 21% of cases were attributed to norovirus and 12% to rotavirus. When Chhabra et al. expanded this study to evaluate the roles of bocavirus, parechovirus, and aichivirus in acute gastroenteritis in addition to the viruses studied here, viruses were identified in two\u2010thirds of their patients. This increased identification of an etiological agent is likely due to their active surveillance and more comprehensive survey. Additionally, there are reports of diarrhea associated with rotavirus groups B in children in Asia [Sanekata et al., 2003] and group C worldwide [Jiang et al., 1995; Kumazaki and Usuku, 2013], as well as toroviruses [Koopmans et al., 1997; Jamieson et al., 1998] in children with gastroenteritis, which were not included in the RT\u2010PCR assay in this study.

A significant amount of adenovirus DNA was detected in children with gastrointestinal symptoms, and while other studies have shown variable detection rates of adenovirus 40 and 41 [Colomba et al., 2006; Chhabra et al., 2013] the assay in this study was able to detect multiple serotypes in addition to 40 and 41. Only serotypes 40 and 41, and occasionally 18 and 31 have been associated with gastroenteritis. Despite the fact that providers at this institution are discouraged from sending samples for EM unless the patient is symptomatic, the numbers in this study may overestimate the burden of gastroenteritis in children attributed to adenoviruses and could represent asymptomatic shedding of non\u2010enteric adenoviruses with other pathogens responsible for symptoms.",

            "text": "Astroviruses have long been known to cause gastroenteritis in humans [De Benedictis et al., 2011; Chhabra et al., 2013]. Recently, however, new astrovirus strains have been discovered and been associated with disease in humans [Zimmerman et al., 2001; Finkbeiner et al., 2008, 2009a, 2009b; Hall, 2011; Lindesmith et al., 2011]. The astrovirus protocol used in this study was not designed to detect these novel strains and likely underestimates the true burden of astrovirus disease in these study patients [Phan et al., 2007; De Benedictis et al., 2011]. Surprisingly, in contrast to other studies, very few cases of sapovirus were detected. In other studies, sapoviruses have been reported to cause more vomiting than diarrhea in children, and this study only evaluated stool samples [Chhabra et al., 2013]. Additionally, no cases were associated with the known endemic human coronaviruses. While similar results have been documented in the literature [Esper et al., 2010; Jev\u0161nik et al., 2013], other studies have found endemic coronaviruses and coronavirus\u2010like particles in stool in patients with gastroenteritis [Payne et al., 1986; Risku et al., 2010]. The data from this study supports the hypothesis that known endemic coronaviruses do not cause clinically significant gastroenteritis in children.",

The data in this study indicate that there was an outbreak of norovirus GII.4 in this community during the winter of 2006\u20132007. This observation supports other data which suggests norovirus GII.4 strain is the leading cause of norovirus outbreaks due to its ability to rapidly evolve through antigenic variation, possibly driven by herd immunity [Lindesmith et al., 2011] as well as recombination [Bull et al., 2007; Phan et al., 2007; Unicef WHO, 2009]. These data also support the observation that multiple different strains of norovirus can circulate in the community at one time, which could facilitate evolution of new strains.",

Several publications have shown variable duration of shedding in pediatric patients both with and without symptoms [Payne et al., 1986, 2013; Wilde et al., 1991; Mitchell et al., 1995; Richardson et al., 1998; Parashar et al., 2003; Wilhelmi et al., 2003; Colomba et al., 2006; Unicef WHO, 2009; Graham et al., 2010; Churgay and Aftab, 2012; Chhabra et al., 2013; Jev\u0161nik et al., 2013]. Data from this study indicate that immunocompromised children, in particular those who have received HSCTs, may be infected and shed enteric viruses for up to 8 months and are at risk for persistent symptomatic infection. These findings have significant clinical and infection control implications and complicate the diagnosis of diarrhea in these study patients. Immunocompromised patients might also provide a reservoir for these viruses and a potential environment for recombination events and generation of novel viral strains [Booth et al., 2003; Choi et al., 2003; Hsu et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Hsueh et al., 2004; Schorn et al., 2010]. Furthermore, prolonged infection with enteric pathogens has been shown to put patients at risk for significant sequelae including severe weight loss, malnutrition, dehydration, and altered intestinal mucosa [Roddie et al., 2009; Schwartz et al., 2011; Jev\u0161nik et al., 2013].",

These results clearly demonstrate that RT\u2010PCR is superior in the detection of noroviruses, astroviruses, and adenoviruses in stool than EM. RT\u2010PCR did not perform significantly better than EM in the diagnosis of rotavirus, but this may have been due to the fact that the RT\u2010PCR assay in use detected only group A rotaviruses, while EM was able to detect groups A\u2010C.

Providers at the institution in this study are discouraged from routinely sending stool samples in patients with acute gastroenteritis unless it will impact clinical care, and this may have caused selection bias toward children with severe symptoms. Diluted stool samples were used, which might have reduced the ability to detect viral nucleic acid present in small amounts. Additionally, the presence of viral nucleic acid in stool may not reflect the cause of current symptoms but could instead reflect prolonged shedding from a previous infection or asymptomatic carriage [Kapusinszky et al., 2012].",
