To further dissect the RDV-TP inhibition mechanism and to test this steric clash 232 hypothesis, we compared the behaviors of RDV-TP with ATP in our T33-1/P10-233 based assays and the WT RdRP and an S861A mutant were also compared 234 regarding the i+3 related product profiles ( Figure 6 ). We first compared the primer 235 extension profiles between the CTP/ATP and CTP/RDV-TP combinations. It turned 236 out that the latter combination led to both the regular 14-mer product (corresponding 237 to the incorporation of a C-R-C-R tetra-nucleotide) and a misincorporation-derived 238 15-mer product. This misincorporation event likely arose from a C:R misincorporation 239 as this activity is greatly reduced when the RDV-TP concentration is lowered ( consider that, with respect to nsp8-upstream RNA interactions, conformation II might 286 be the dominant state during RNA processive elongation, rather than conformation I. 287",

Here we examine the 30 molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication by determining the cryo-EM 31 structures of the stalled pre-/post-translocated polymerase complexes. The 32 structures show notable structural rearrangements occurring to nsp12 and its 33 cofactors nsp7/nsp8 to accommodate the nucleic acid compared to the apo complex, 34 while there are highly conserved residues in nsp12 positioning the template and 35 primer for an in-line attack on the incoming nucleotide. Furthermore, we investigate 36 the inhibition mechanisms of the triphosphate metabolite of remdesivir through 37 structural and kinetic analyses. A transition model from the nsp7-nsp8 38 hexadecameric primase complex to the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 polymerase complex is 39 also proposed to provide clues for the understanding of the coronavirus 40 transcription/replication machinery. 41 INTRODUCTION 43 The current pandemic of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019), a respiratory 44 disease that has led to more than two million cases and a global pandemic are 45 caused by a novel virus strain, SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped, positive-sense, single-46 stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae (Zhu et al., 2020). 47 Peersen, 2014). It participates in NTP ribose recognition and RdRP active site 161 closure (Shu and Gong, 2016), and has been proposed to mediate RdRP 162 translocation (Sholders and Peersen, 2014). At the same time, on the opposite side 163 of the template strand, motif G (D499-L514) on the fingers also exhibits interaction 164",

            "text": "Center, , , , Incorporation and Implications for Inhibition by the 191 Nucleotide Analogues Inhibitors 192 The catalytic center of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 is constructed by seven conserved motifs 193 from A to G (Gao et al., 2020) (Figure 5A). In the pre-translocation structure, the 194 base pair of cytosine and guanosine at +1 position, have an unequivocal cryo-EM 195 map signal (Figure 5B), which is tightly coordinated by the interactions from several 196 conserved residues. Specifically, the backbone nitrogen atom of S501 and the 197 sidechain of V557, respectively, position the phosphate and base moieties of 198 cytosine on the template (Figure 5A). The backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of S682 199 and the nitrogen atom of the K545 side chain jointly stabilize the base group of 200 guanosine from both sides, while D623 stabilizes its ribose group through an 201 interaction with the 3\u2032 hydroxyl group (Figure 5B). Given that favipiravir is a guanine 202 analog, we aligned favipiravir mono-phosphate onto the guanosine to pair with the 203 cytosine at +1 position of template, based on a superposition on their phosphate and 204 ribose groups. Interestingly, the distance between the side-chain nitrogen atom of 205 K545 and the carboxamide oxygen atom and exocyclic amide of favipiravir are both 206 about 3 \u00c5 (Figure 5B). 207 RDV is a phosphoramidate prodrug of a 1\u2032-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide 208 analog that shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses 209 (Siegel et al., 2017). Its triphosphate form (RDV-TP) can be used as a substrate of 210 several viral RdRP enzymes or complexes (Agostini et al., 2018; Tchesnokov et al., 211 2019). In contrast to classic chain-terminators, inhibition of chain elongation is not 212 observed immediately following the incorporated RDV monophosphate (RDV-MP) 213 (Jordan et al., 2018; Tchesnokov et al., 2019). Its 3\u2032-OH group allows the 214 nucleophilic in-line attack on the incoming NTP. Indeed, in the pre-translocation 215 complex, the 2.9 \u00c5 well-resolved map signal on the 1\u2032-cyano group of the -1 product 216 nucleotide ensures the assignment of RDV-MP which had been incorporated and 217 translocated to -1 position, while the 3\u2032-guanosine occupied the +1 position (Figures 218 5A and 5D). In previous enzyme kinetics analysis (Gordon et al., 2020), favorable 219 reactivity for the RDV-TP over ATP and delayed chain-termination at position i+3 220 (where i corresponds to the position of the first incorporated RDV-MP) are observed 221 to be the key features of the mechanism of inhibition with SARS-CoV-2 RdRP 222 complexes. When RdRP synthesis proceeds to the i+3 position, the first incorporated 223 RDV-MP will be at position -3 or -4 for pre-or post-translocated state, respectively. 224 According to the previous molecular modeling analysis, the 1\u2032-CN substituent of 225 incorporated RDV-MP could encounter a steric clash from the sidechain of S861 and 226 probably lead to a distortion of the positioning of the RNA, hampering translocation 227 to the -4 position (Gordon et al., 2020). Based on the current 2.9 \u00c5 catalytic pre-228 translocated complex structures, if one aligns the incorporated RDV-MP onto the 229 adenosine at -4 position, the serine hydroxyl oxygen would be as close as 2 \u00c5 from 230 the 1\u2032-cyano nitrogen (Figure 5E). 231",

We then compared 242 the extension profiles between the CTP/ATP/GTP and CTP/RDV-TP/GTP 243 combinations. For both the WT RdRP and the S861A mutant, the CTP/ATP/GTP 244 combination led to the synthesis of the expected 16-mer product and a small amount 245 of 17-mer product due to misincorporation, while the S861A mutant appeared to be 246 more reactive (Figure 6C). As expected, the CTP/RDV-TP/GTP combination resulted 247 in the production of a 15-mer product corresponding to the synthesis at the i+3 248 position, with the estimated fraction of termination (i.e. the fraction of 15-mer to 15-249 mer and longer products based on band intensities) values of 0.71-0.77 and 0.13-250 0.14 for low (20 \u00b5M) and high (300 \u00b5M) GTP concentrations at the 90-min reaction 251 time point, respectively (Figure 6C, lane 57/67 and 53/63). This observation is 252 consistent with the previous study showing the incoming NTP reduced the i+3 253 termination (Gordon et al., 2020). Compared with the WT RdRP, the S861A mutant 254 had a smaller fraction of i+3 termination at all tested GTP concentrations, providing valid support of the steric clash hypothesis (Figure 6C, compare lanes 52have obtained two cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRP-RNA catalytic 259 complex in both RDV-MP incorporated pre-translocation and stalled post-260 translocation states and provide a comprehensive view of the active site. This result 261 is of significance for the design optimization of potential drug candidates, such as 262 remdesivir and favipiravir. The N-terminal NiRAN domain of RdRP in apo and the 263 two catalytic states shows dramatic conformational changes, and a strong undefined 264 signal appears in the vicinity of K73, R116, and D218 in the pre-translocation 265 complex (Figure S5B). Clarifying these features may require further investigation. 266 The coronavirus polymerase complex is composed of RdRP nsp12 and its cofactors 267 nsp7 and nsp8. However, the existing structures of the complexes to date (Gao et al., 268 2020; Yin et al., 2020) have not revealed the complete nsp8. The functional role of 269 the two cofactors has remained an enigma. Increased RNA synthesis efficiency 270 associated with the simultaneously presence of nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 has been 271 characterized on SARS-CoV-1 (Subissi et al., 2014). A similar phenomenon on 272 SARS-CoV-2 was also observed under our primer extension assay setup (Figure S6). 273 In our work, we have revealed the overall structure of the two bound nsp8 molecules 274 in different conformational states. The potential mechanism for promoting 275 polymerase activity by stabilizing existing RNA through the interactions on their N-276 terminal helical extension is described. While this paper was under review, a study 277 was posted as a preprint reporting a cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP 278 complex with a 24-base-pair (bp) template-primer RNA (Hillen et al., 2020), which is 279 formed by three repetitive RNA pairs connected through palindromic GUAC sticky 280 ends. Although that structure likely represents a pre-catalytic or pre-initiation state 281 that has not gone through catalysis, it seems to represent a similar global 282 architecture to what is observed in the conformation II of our pre-translocation 283 complex. The observation of such a conformation as the dominant form in the 284 presence of their longer RNA duplex is informative. This observation led us to 285",

After reviewing our previous work on the nsp7-nsp8 294 hexadecameric primase complex structure of SARS-CoV-1 (Zhai et al., 2005), we 295 found that this pair of nsp7 and nsp8-1 have a similar relative position and 296 conformation with one of the pairs in their hexadecameric complex (Figures 7A to 297 7C). The ring-shaped hexadecameric complex is believed to dissociate into two 298 octamers \"half-rings\" after primer synthesis (Li et al., 2010). If we superimpose the 299 \"half-ring\" on to the nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 complex and assume that the nucleic acid 300 passes through the central pore of the primase enzyme during primer synthesis 301 (Zhai et al., 2005), we find that the substrate paths of the two are in a surprisingly 302 close and parallel position (Figure 7D). Thus, there is the possibility of a fairly direct 303 substrate channeling or \"hand-over\" between these two enzyme complexes. Based 304 on this analysis, we propose a model for understanding the transition steps from the 305 primase complex to the catalytic complex (Figure 7E). 306 Coronavirus replication and transcription are mediated by a replication/transcription 307 complex (RTC) of which virus-encoded, non-structural proteins (nsps) are the 308 primary constituents. A broader spatiotemporal view of this complex viral 309 replication/transcription mechanisms will help to develop antiviral drugs that interfere 310 with this kernel process of viral replication. In addition to optimizing the inhibitor's 311 ability to target nsp12 for efficient incorporation into the RNA genome, one can also 312 consider blocking the integrity of the polymerase complex, such as the interaction 313 between nsp8 and nsp12, or the ability to evade or overcome the proofreading 314 activity of the viral exoribonuclease (ExoN)\uff0csuch as \u03b2-d-N4-Hydroxycytidine (NHC) 315 (Agostini et al., 2019).316",

IEX: ion-exchange chromatography. 358 (A) The post-translocated complex assembly was performed using a T33-1/P10 359 construct, the three nsp proteins, and CTP/ATP as the only NTP substrates to allow 360 the synthesis of a 14-mer product (P14). The majority of the P10 was converted to 361 P14 after a 90-min incubation (M: a marker with a mixture of 33-mer and 10-mer 362 RNAs). The P14-containing catalytic complex was purified by anion exchange 363 chromatography, and the purified complex can further react with GTP (G) or 3\u2032-364 deoxy-GTP (3dG) to yield the 16-mer (P16) or 15-mer containing complexes, 365 respectively. The structure of this P14-containing complex was solved in cryo-EM 366 trials at the post-translocated state. 367 (B) The pre-translocated complex was obtained through a two-step process. In the 368 first step, a T33-7/P10 construct, the three nsp proteins, and CTP/ATP were mixed 369 to allow the synthesis of a 14-mer product (P14). The majority of the P10 are 370 converted to P14 after a 180-min incubation. The P14-containing catalytic complex 371 was purified by anion exchange chromatography, and the purified complex can 372 further react with G or 3dG to yield the 16-mer (P16) or 15-mer containing 373 complexes, respectively. In the second step, the purified P14-containing complex 374 was mixed with GTP and RDV-TP, and a pausing event corresponding to the 375 synthesis of an 18-mer product (P18) was observed. The structure of this P18-376 containing complex was solved in cryo-EM trials at the pre-translocated state. See also Figures S1.

The reaction mixture was then loaded onto a MonoQ column (GE 541 Healthcare) equilibrated in a Low-Salt buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, 542 5 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM DTT) and the catalytic complex was eluted with a linear gradient 543to 1 M NaCl. The pooled complex fractions were buffer exchanged to the Low-Salt 544 buffer and concentrated to reach a concentration of 5 mg/mL for further cryo-EM 545 experiments. To test the reactivity of the P14-containing complex, GTP or 3\u2032-deoxy-546 GTP (3dGTP) were supplied at 300 \u00b5M to allow the synthesis of a 16-mer or 15-mer 547 product, respectively. The RNA T33-7/P10 modified from T33-1/P10, a U substitution 548 of A in the template, was designed for RDV-TP incorporation into the P14-containing 549 complex (pre-translocation complex). The procedure for obtaining the P14-containing 550 complex was the same as described above. The pooled complex fractions from the 551 MonoQ column were buffer-exchanged to the Low-Salt buffer and concentrated to 552 reach a concentration of 9 mg/mL. After the addition of 100 \u00b5M GTP and 100 \u00b5M RDV-TP, the complex was incubated at 4\u2103 for 30min before conducting the cryo-EM 554experiment. 555In the T33-1/P10-based primer-dependent polymerase assays for comparing the 556 behaviors of RDV-TP and ATP, unless otherwise indicated, a typical 20-\u00b5L reaction 557 mixture containing 6 \u00b5M WT nsp12 or its variant S861A, 6 \u00b5M nsp7, 12 \u00b5M nsp8, 4 558\u00b5M T33-1/P10, and 300 \u00b5M each NTP, in a buffer of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 50 mM 559 NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM DTT was incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 20 and 90 min.

A 33-mer DNA complementary to T33-1 was added to the 563 quenched samples at a 4:1 or 3:1 molar ratio (DNA:RNA) to help release the RNA 564 products from the template. RNA species were resolved by 20% polyacrylamide/7 M 565 urea gel electrophoresis and then visualized by staining with Stains-All (Sigma-566 Aldrich).

Kieft) that contains a T7 promoter and 573 a glmS ribozyme sequence in the transcribed region. The pRAV23 plasmid and 574 synthetic DNAs that contain sequences to generate the target RNAs were used in 575 PCR reactions to generate T7-promoter containing DNA constructs, which in turn 576 serve as the template in 8-16 mL transcription reactions in a buffer (60 mM HEPES 577 (pH 7.8), 18 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM spermidine, 0.01 % (vol./vol.)
