By February 10, there were 28 cases of laboratory-confirmed coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection) in South Korea (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). The characteristics of these patients1 and the patient numbers are provided in Table S1. The median age of the patients was 41 years (range, 21 to 73), and 15 of the 28 patients (54%) were men. The mean interval (\u00b1SD) from symptom onset to diagnosis was 4.3\u00b14.1 days.",

Although asymptomatic transmission has been suggested, it is uncertain when patients with Covid-19 are infectious during the incubation period or whether they are infectious primarily when they have symptoms.5 Better assessments of viral shedding are needed to properly inform our understanding of transmission dynamics and infection-control practices. Early detection of Covid-19 is difficult because of its apparent subclinical nature in some persons.",
