In addition norovirus can cause chronic infection in the immunocompromised patient. There are five genogroups of norovirus of which GI and GII are most associated with infection in humans. Rotavirus was the main cause of severe diarrhoea in children under 2 years old in the UK with some studies finding rotavirus the cause of 20-60% of hospitalisations (Wilhelmi et al., 2003) however since the introduction of the vaccine in 2013 in the UK this has dramatically reduced (Atchison and Hassounah, 2015) . Rotavirus infections in adults and the elderly are less common but have been documented and severe and prolonged infections have been documented in immunocom-promised patients. Astrovirus, sapovirus and adenovirus are also important etiological agents of gastroenteritis. Astroviruses have been reported to be a leading cause of gastroenteritis in the community causing 4-10% of cases, and has been reported to cause cases in all age groups but mainly in those less than two years old (Hye Sook Jeong et al., 2012) . Eight human serotypes exist with type one being the most common. Adenovirus is a common cause of infectious intestinal disease (IID) in children with group F types 40 and 41 being the main causes of gastroenteritis however other types can causes IID (Wilhelmi et al., 2003) . Adenovirus is endemic and is an uncommon cause of outbreaks and has been reported to be the cause of 1-8% of cases in industrialised countries (Wilhelmi et al., 2003) . Sapovirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis in young children, although rare cases have been documented in older ages and outbreaks have occasionally been documented (Robinson et al., 2002) .

Also some commercial available real-time panels for gastroenteritis do not have a single multiplex of all four viruses, for example the FTD (Fast-Tract Diagnostics) Viral gastroenteritis panel (Fast-Track Diagnostics Ltd, Malta) consists of a multiplex for adenovirus, astrovirus and rotavirus with a separate sapovirus single test.

At the WoSSVC an in-house developed norovirus multiplex which detects and differentiates GI and GII subtypes as well as an internal control is used. Norovirus negative outbreaks are subsequently tested for adenovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus and sapovirus using a 'GAS' (gastroenteritis) panel which consists of four single tests for adenovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus and sapovirus. Sporadic gastroenteritis cases in children (less than 10 years old) and immunocompromised patients (all ages) are screened for adenovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus and sapovirus and norovirus simultaneously (both panels of assays set up at the same time).

These assays have been shown to be sensitive and specific, and to detect all relevant IID causing strains. These assays have been previously validated against conventional PCR methods, and these assays also been accredited by the Clinical Pathology Accreditation (CPA) and the UK Accreditation Service (UKAS). In addition since implementation in 2004 these assays have been assessed by annual/biannual external QC panels to ensure sensitivity and specificity. Previous attempts to multiplex these four assays into one multiplex assay have failed. The main problems encountered were determined to be due to the astrovirus and rotavirus tests, these assays interacted with other assays in the multiplex causing false negative results. Due to interactions between the assays we used alternative astrovirus and rotavirus assays published by a well established research group Eric Claas - van Maarseveen et al. (2010) and attempted to multiplex with the existing adenovirus and sapovirus assays (sequences in Table 1 ). Again these assays have been shown to be sensitive and specific, and to detect all relevant IID causing strains. The astrovirus assay was designed by the Claas group and assessed by assessment of analytical sensitivity and specificity and clinical evaluation of 239 clinical samples.
