            "text": "In August 2019, Saudi Arabia (KSA) will host the largest annual mass gathering; the Hajj. In its 1436 year history [1], the 2019 Hajj event will be the largest in volume (projected to exceed 2.2 million international attendees). As it attracts pilgrims from over 180 countries, and with the ever increasing infectious disease threats, the Hajj is a closely watched event of significance to global public health [[1], [2], [3]].While the pilgrims and their families make preparations for the journey, both the Saudi health authorities and international public health stakeholders are on high alert in the months before and after Hajj [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. Preceding the Hajj, the stakeholders debate and formulate advisories around hypothetical scenarios of \u201cwhat if\u201d (potential spread of ongoing disease outbreaks), and \u201cwhat will\u201d (emerge as new threats during the Hajj). Post-Hajj, the scenarios are much more challenging as we try to assess \u201cwhat was transmitted\u201d and \u201cwhere did it go\u201d in a global landscape of patchy and non-standardized disease surveillance systems. Adding to the conundrum is the ever increasing volume of pilgrims to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), with a projected 4.5 million annual attendees by 2030; and the lesser known, year-around, religious ritual, the Umrah (30 million pilgrims), during which some diseases may have already been transmitted and Hajj-related travelers can unknowingly amplify transmission.",

In addition, the intense and exhausting nature of the pilgrimage rituals and the extreme desert temperature, all create a unique environment for infectious disease transmission and allow outbreaks to go undetected before reaching epidemic thresholds [[1], [2], [3],8,9].",

First of all, health advisories and vaccination requirements for participation in Hajj are based on known threats and countermeasures and may not offer \u2018carte blanche\u2019 protection against other infectious diseases that emerge (eg: novel influenza viruses) or the changing geography of transmission (eg: Nipah, 2018). Secondly, potential Hajj-related transmission risk is not just for the Hajj pilgrims. As Hajj pilgrims mingle with other passengers and airline staff inflight, transit airports and airline hubs, any transmitted infection by a pilgrim is a risk for all travelers, and ultimately for their home communities and the \u201cglobal village\u201d that is our world.",

While the WHO International Health Regulations provide the platform for coordination among countries, travel health services (both in the host and home countries) can serve as venues to alert patients on asymmetrical disease threats and ensure the practice of the highest level of personal protection. In addition to explicitly recommended measures in WHO and Saudi communiques [4,5], pilgrims need to maintain good personal hygiene and health measures, comply with adequate treatment for existing co-morbidities such as diabetes, and seek medical care when needed. As shown by the containment of recent Nipah outbreak in Kerala, early reporting of illness to health authorities can help authorities to detect emerging threats and to mount and coordinate control efforts. Health care providers and disease surveillance entities around the world need to be aware of this seasonal annual event to enable early assessment of unusual symptoms and disease patterns. With these simple measures, each pilgrim, each travel health care provider, each surveillance officer can contribute to protecting the health of all pilgrims, and thereby the rest of the world.",
