HIV-positive men were randomised to a single subcutaneous dose of C34-PEG 4 -Chol at incrementing doses or placebo. Detailed clinical (including injection site reaction (ISR) grading), plasma pharmacokinetic (time-to-minimum-effectiveconcentration (MEC, 25 ng/mL) and pharmacodynamic (plasma HIV RNA) parameters were assessed. In both mice and dogs, no-observed-adverse effect level (NOAEL) was observed at a 12 mg/kg/dose after two weeks. Of 5 men enrolled, 3 received active drug (10 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg). In 2 individuals grade 3 ISR occurred and the study was halted. Both ISR emerged within 12 hours of active drug dosing. No systemic toxicities were observed. The time-to-MEC was >72 and >96 hours after 10 and 20 mg dose, respectively, and mean change in HIV RNA was \u22120.9 log10 copies/mL. These human pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data, although limited to 3 subjects, of C34-PEG-4-Chol suggest continuing evaluation of this agent as a LA-ARV. However, alternative administration routes must be explored.",

Consequent to the success of antiretroviral therapy and the longevity expected for PLWH, over recent decades there has been a gradual upward shift in the median age of PLWH. Antiretroviral therapy management becomes increasingly challenging in older individuals due to the presence of non-infectious co-morbidities 2 , which are reported to occur at a higher incidence in PLWH compared to matched control populations, the presence of poly-pharmacy and drug-drug interactions. As such, there is an urgent unmet need for new antiretroviral agents and combinations for older PLWH which includes drugs with a low propensity for drug-drug interactions and which lack end-organ toxicities 3 .",

Their mechanism of action is to prevent the formation of a critical intermediate along the virus-cell fusion pathway responsible for enacting cell-virus fusion. To date, only one FI, enfuvirtide has been approved for use 4, 5 . Clinical use of enfuvirtide has been limited by the lack of oral bioavailability and short half-life, thus necessitating twice daily subcutaneous injections, and high rates of painful injection site reactions (ISRs). Notwithstanding, enfuvirtide and other investigational FIs display low systemic toxicity and a general lack of drug-drug interactions, making them promising for further investigation as antiretroviral agents 4-6 . Modification of a number of FI compounds has prolonged their plasma half-lives in animal models and fueled a renewed interest in their development as potentially long-acting antiretroviral drugs suitable for use in older PLWH with comorbidities and receiving concomitant medications 7-9 .",

With an IC 90 between 15-460 pM (0.08-2.5 ng/mL) depending on the viral strain, C34-PEG 4 -Chol is the most potent HIV fusion inhibitor to date 12 . Moreover, the cholesterol moiety drives binding to serum proteins, an effective way to improve peptide pharmacokinetics 13 and accordingly, the circulatory half-life of C34 in rodents is extended by 10-fold when conjugated with cholesterol 12 .

Each participant received a single subcutaneous dose of either C34-PEG 4 -Chol or placebo (saline). Dosing was commenced at the lowest dose of 10 mg in a volume of 1 mL. Randomisation was undertaken using the InForm \u2122 Integrated Trial Management system and was on a 1:1 basis, with no predefined stratifications. All clinical study staff were blinded.

Plasma samples (100 \u00b5L) were extracted in 300 \u00b5L of acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid; vortexed and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was transferred into autosampler vials, and 25 \u03bcL injected onto the LC-MS/MS. Quantitative analysis of C34-PEG 4 -Chol was performed by LC-MS/MS using a Thermo Quantum Access triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, interfaced with a heated electrospray ionisation (H-ESI) source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK). The HPLC system included a variable loop Accela autosampler and an Accela pump (ThermoScientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK).

However, we observed ISRs meeting grade 3 adverse event criteria in 2 out of 3 individuals administered C34-PEG 4 -Chol via the subcutaneous route. In the pre-clinical studies, ISRs had not been observed in mice and were mild and reversible in dogs. In this species ISRs, albeit milder, were also observed in the control group, suggesting that the chosen formulation might have contributed to the side-effect. Although high rates of ISRs are observed with subcutaneous administration of enfuvirtide, and therefore not an absolute impediment for clinical use, in the present scenario of HIV therapeutics we do not consider this route of administration suitable for further clinical development. Rather, intramuscular administration might represent a viable option, in light of recent data showing that rates of ISR are less marked when long-acting rilprivirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor is administered via intramuscular administration compared to subcutaneous 18 . Identification of both an administration route and a different formulation for C34-PEG 4 -chol that minimises ISRs would be attractive, since the preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of C34-PEG 4 -Chol we have observed in HIV-positive men are supportive of continuing evaluation of this drug. At a dose of 10 mg of C34-PEG 4 -Chol, we observed in two subjects a plasma concentration above the LLOQ of 62 ng/mL at 72 hours (Fig. 2) . This concentration is still 25-770 fold the IC 90 observed in vitro on several viral strains and notably, it coincides with the threshold (67 ng/mL) which prevents growth of resistant virus in vitro. In the only subject at the 20 mg dose, LLOQ was reached after 96 h. We have observed linear dose-exposure in animals, and limited to the two doses here, also in humans (Table 2 ). Extrapolation to higher doses, up to the intended maximum of 80 mg, strongly suggests the possibility of once-weekly use, although such extrapolations are based on data from only 3 subjects. For comparison, enfuvirtide requires administration of a 90 mg dose twice-daily. The preliminary pharmacodynamic data are also encouraging, with \u22650.5 Log 10 reduction in plasma HIV RNA observed in all three participants after a single dose at the lower end (10-20 mg) of the intended dose range (10-80 mg) (Fig. 3) . Notably, rebound of viral load was measured only after 96 hours, which is consistent with a plasma concentration of C34-PEG 4 -Chol above the IC 90 for longer than our assay could measure. Our pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic observations are limited to three subjects, and therefore lack statistical power to infer such observations would be observed with larger numbers of subjects. 25 , and Infectious Bronchitis Virus 25 . In all cases, cholesterol conjugation improved the FI potency 50-100 fold 26 . For some of these viruses, efficacy was demonstrated in vivo 22, 23, 25 and notably, the peptide was detectable in the brain 24 hours after administration 22, 23, 25 , indicating that cholesterol conjugation may enable penetration of the blood-brain barrier, a difficult feat for drugs in general, and for biologics in particular 27 .",

Therefore the optimal pharmacokinetic profile observed in humans for C34-PEG 4 -Chol suggests that similar data are likely to be observed for other cholesterol-conjugated FIs.",

In particular for the threat of emerging viral diseases, it should be noted that FIs can be developed rapidly because their design only requires knowledge of the viral genome, which is available before or rapidly acquired at the time of an epidemic. Moreover, since for each viral family the fusion proteins, from which the FIs are derived, share the same mechanism of action and display considerable sequence conservation, a cholesterol-conjugated FI for a \"sentinel virus\" would represent the template for all the other viruses within the same family.",
