One anaesthetist (JM) placed LMA Classic, Ambu AuraFlex and 2nd generation SGAs (all size # 4) which were available in our operating theatre, using an AirSim airway manikin (TruCorp, Craigavon, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom). After the placement of the device, an attempt was made to secure them to the chin by an adhesive tape. Difficulties in securing the device to the chin were noted. Each device was connected to a corrugated straight catheter mount or angled connector if considered suitable in a bid to reduce the vertical profile. Vertical projections of all devices were measured from the chin using a plastic centimetre ruler and were photographed at a fixed distance from the camera lens to manikin using a Nikon 85 mm D700 SLR camera (Fig. 1). All photographs were combined using Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, California, USA). No image editing was allowed.",

The LMA Classic and the Ambu AuraFlex are the two widely used 1st generation SGAs. The long and flexible part of airway tube of the 1st generation SGAs allows the anaesthetists to secure the tube to the chin away from the surgical site in the same way as an the endotracheal tube, thereby maximising the operating field and minimising interference to the surgeon. However, the use of mechanical ventilation through 1st generation SGAs for surgeries lasting more than 2 h may not be appropriate, due to the increased risk of gastric insufflation and possible aspiration. To mitigate this risk, an orogastric tube can be inserted prior to SGA placement to allow for gastric decompression (Fig. 2). A drawback of this technique is that the indentation of the SGA cuff created by the orogastric tube can result in an increased leak and lower seal pressures during positive pressure ventilation, resulting in unreliable ventilation and anaesthetic gas delivery.",

            "text": "The 2nd generation SGAs such as the LMA ProSeal, LMA Supreme, AuraGain, LMA Protector and I-gel are designed to provide safer mechanical ventilation for longer periods thanks to a separate gastric channel, compared to their 1st generation counterparts. The cuff designs confer higher seal pressures and a built-in drainage port allows the insertion of a gastric tube through the gastric channel for gastric decompression. Presence of gastric fluid within the drainage port also serves as an early warning of regurgitation allowing for prompt management to avoid pulmonary aspiration. Appropriate use of SGA is not associated with increased aspiration risk, as supported by a systematic review, which demonstrated similar incidences of regurgitation with the use of supraglottic airway devices with built-in gastric channel and endotracheal tube intubation [3]. These safety features of 2nd generation SGA result in increased bulk and stiffness of the airway tube which increases the vertical projection and encroach into the operating field, interfering with instrumentation during surgery. This might be especially so for cataract surgeries, where the surgeon may operate from the side of the patient (temporal approach phacoemulsification). For vitreoretinal and squint surgery, the surgeon usually approaches the surgical field from the head end; hence instrumentation is less likely to be hampered by the SGA. The addition of an angle connector or straight corrugated connector (subject to preference of the anaesthetist) between the airway device and the ventilator tubing helps to direct the airway tube caudally, away from the surgical field, however, connectors may also affect vertical heights. LMA ProSeal was identified as the best SGA with the lowest vertical projection amongst the 2nd generation SGAs and can be used if the 1st generation LMA Classic and Ambu AuraFlex are not available or when their use may not be appropriate. LMA Supreme, LMA AuraGain, LMA Protector and I-gel appear to be less than optimal.",

While insertion of SGAs in a manikin allowed standardisation of conditions for objective and quantitative measurements of vertical heights, the measurements may be subject to minor error. The vertical height and performance of each SGA also likely to vary with chosen SGA size and various patient\u2019s characteristics (e.g. anatomy, obesity, dentition or the lack thereof, skeletal and soft tissue structures and anthropometry, etc.) in the clinical setting. We chose the commonly used SGA (size #4) in our institution and the repertoire is not exhaustive. The projected height is expected to be even higher with size #5 of the 2nd generation SGAs. Transferability of our findings into clinical practice is questionable as the use of a manikin may not fully imitate actual clinical conditions.",

Some clinicians may not be inclined to use the 1st generation SGA because of fear of gastric insufflation and subsequent risk of aspiration. Our manikin study has shown that among the 2nd generation SGAs, LMA ProSeal appears to have a more favourable vertical profile. We also describe a novel technique where 1st generation SGA may be used together with an orogastric tubes to mitigate aspiration risk in more prolonged ophthalmic surgeries. Our study is the first study comparing vertical heights of different 2nd generation SGAs in a standardised manikin. Custom-made or bespoke cradles may be considered to direct the SGA away from the surgical field. We recommend future studies to investigate the use of 2nd generation SGA in the clinical setting during ophthalmic surgery.",
