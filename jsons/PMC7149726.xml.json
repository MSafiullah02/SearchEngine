            "text": "During the past three decades, there has been a growing realization that breast-feeding not only provides the nutritional requirements of the infant, but also supplies a host of defense factors for the protection of the recipient and/or the mammary gland. The study of this remarkable defense system in human milk has been difficult, however, because of its biochemical complexities, the small concentrations of certain very potent agents in human milk, the need to develop special methods to quantify certain factors because of their particular forms in human milk, the compartmentalization of some of the agents, and the dynamic effects of the length of lactation and other maternal factors upon the concentrations or functions of the components of the system. In this chapter, we summarize the current information concerning the molecular forms, concentrations in milk during the several phases of lactation, biological activities, fate in the recipient infant, and in vivo functions of the defense agents in human milk.",

As lactation progresses, the concentrations of many of the factors in human milk fall. Concomitantly, the production at mucosal sites of those very factors rises in the developing infant; (2) most components of the immunologic system in human milk are produced throughout lactation and during gradual weaning; (3) the factors are usually common to other mucosal sites; (4) they are adapted to resist digestion in the gastrointestinal tract of the recipient infant; (5) they protect by noninflammatory mechanisms; and (6) the agents act synergistically with each other or with defense agents produced by the recipient. Representative examples of soluble defense agents are listed in Table I\n.",

The inhibition of toxin binding appears to be associated with acidic glycolipids that contain sialic acid (gangliosides). Although the total quantities of gangliosides in human and bovine milk are similar, the relative frequency of each type of ganglioside composition is distinct. Monosialo-ganglioside 3 predominates in human milk (about 74% of total gangliosides), but not in bovine milk (Laegreid et al., 1986a,b), and the enterotoxin receptor ganglioside, GM1, as measured by a highly sensitive immunostaining method, is 10-fold greater in human than bovine milk (Laegreid et al., 1986a). In that respect, GM1 inhibits the enterotoxins of E. coli and V. cholerae (Laegreid and Otnaess, 1987).",

            "text": "Lactoferrin, a member of the transferrin family of iron-binding glycoproteins, is the dominant whey protein in human milk. Lactoferrin, a single-chain glycoprotein with 703 amino acids, has an Mr of 79 kDa and two globular lobes, both of which display a site that binds ferric iron (Anderson et al., 1987). Except for a 20-kDa fragment of lactoferrin that immunologically cross-reacts with bovine \u03b2-lactoglobulin (Monti et al., 1989), the vast majority of lactoferrin in human milk consists of intact molecules. Over 90% of the lactoferrin in human milk is in the form of apolactoferrin (i.e., does not contain ferric iron) (Fransson and Lonnerdal, 1980). This is highly advantageous, since apolactoferrin competes with siderophilic bacteria for ferric iron (Arnold et al., 1977; Bullen et al., 1972; Spik et al., 1978; Stephens et al., 1980; Stuart et al., 1984) and thus disrupts the proliferation of those microbial pathogens. The epithelial growth-promoting activities of lactoferrin in human milk may also be advantageous to the defense of the recipient infant (Nichols et al., 1987). The mean concentration of lactoferrin in human colostrum as measured by electroimmunodiffusion is between 5 and 6 mg/ml (Goldblum et al., 1982). The concentration at 4 weeks falls to about 2 mg/ml (Goldblum et al., 1981; Goldman et al., 1982). Afterwards, the concentration of lactoferrin averages about 1 mg/ml (Goldman et al., 1982).",

The total daily secretion of lactoferrin in human milk during the first 4 months of lactation has been investigated by a test-weighing procedure and immunologic assays. The approximate mean intake of milk lactoferrin per day in healthy full-term infants was reported to be 260 mg per kilogram per day at 1 month and 125 mg per kilogram per day by 4 months (Butte et al., 1984). The amount of lactoferrin excreted in the stools of low birth weight infants fed human milk appears to be about 185 times that in infants fed a cow's milk formula (Schanler et al., 1986). However, this estimate is probably too high because of the presence of immunoreactive fragments of that protein (Goldman et al., 1990).",

Lysozyme lyses susceptible bacteria by hydrolyzing \u03b2-1,4 linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and 2-acetylamino-2-deoxy-D-glucose residues in cell walls (Chipman and Sharon, 1969). The agent is relatively resistant to digestion by trypsin or denaturation due to acid. The mean concentration of lysozyme in colostrum as measured by electroimmunodiffusion is about 70 \u03bcg/ml (Goldblum et al., 1981). The concentration drops to about 20 \u03bcg/ml at 1 month of lactation and then rises to a mean of 250 \u03bcg/ml by 6 months (Goldman et al., 1982). The approximate mean intake of milk lysozyme per day in healthy full-term infants was reported to be 3 or 4 mg per kilogram per day at 1 month and 6 mg per kilogram per day by 4 months (Butte et al., 1984).",

The predominant immunoglobulin in human milk is IgA (Goldman and Goldblum, 1989). IgA is the dominant immunoglobulin in human milk, whereas IgG is the most common one in adult blood and interstitial fluids. The principal molecular forms of IgA in blood and milk are different. The main form in serum is a four-chain structure consisting of two identical heavy polypeptide chains (predominantly the \u03b1 1 isotype) and two identical light chains (either \u03c7 or \u03bb) linked by disulfide bonds. In contrast to the IgA monomers, a polymeric form of IgA, secretory IgA, comprises over 95% of IgA in human milk (Goldman and Goldblum, 1989). This type of IgA consists of two identical IgA monomers united by a 15-kDa polypeptide called the joining or J chain and complexed to a 75-kDa glycopeptide designated as secretory component (Mostov and Blobel, 1982; Mostov et al., 1984; Solari and Kraehenbuhl, 1984). This form of IgA is assembled when dimeric IgA binds to the first domain of polymeric immunoglobulin receptors (Bakos et al., 1991) on the basolateral surface membranes of epithelial cells. Before the assembled molecule is secreted, the intracellular part of the original receptor is cleaved so that the final molecule consists of the ectoplasmic portion (secretory component) and dimeric IgA. Secretory IgA is more resistant to proteolytic enzymes and therefore is more able to persist in the intestinal tract than other immunoglobulins.",

The immunogen is recognized by B cells which display specific IgM antibodies to the immunogen. The immunoglobulin isotype of the B cells is switched to IgA, and those B cells are then launched into a migration pathway that begins in the intestinal lymphatics and ends in the lamina propia of the mammary gland.

Depending upon the precise question, it may be necessary to determine the fine specificity, avidity, isotypes, and quantities of antibodies in milk. The determination of the fine specificity depends upon the use of highly specific antigens. Even then, immunologic cross-reactivity, particularly against common enteric microorganisms and food antigens, may occur. Because of the structure of secretory IgA, immunoassays that are designed to quantify IgA will also detect secretory IgA, but the resultant data may also reflect the presence of other molecular forms of IgA, such as monomeric or dimeric IgA, that are not complexed to secretory component. Secretory IgA antibodies may be distinguished from other types of IgA antibodies by using specific antibodies to secretory component in solid-phase immunoassays, although secretory IgM antibodies will also be detected.",

There is controversy concerning the relative frequencies of the major subsets of T cells in human milk and some of the differences in the results from different studies may be due to methodologic variables. The proportions of CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ in unfractionated human milk leukocytes examined by immunofluorescent microscopy were similar to those in human blood (Keller et al., 1986), whereas the proportions of CD+CD8+ in human milk leukocytes that were separated by density gradient centrifugation and examined by flow cytometry were higher than those in peripheral blood (Richie et al., 1982). Recently, unfractionated human milk leukocytes were found by flow cytometry to have a higher relative frequency of CD3+ CD8+ than those in peripheral blood (Wirt et al., 1992). The cytotoxic responses of these cells are poor (Kohl et al., 1978, 1980), but the cells are capable of generating certain lymphokines, including interferon-\u03b3 and monocyte chemotactic factor Emodi and Just, 1974; Keller et al., 1981; Lawton et al., 1979). In that respect, essentially all T cells in human milk bear the phenotypic marker of memory T cells (leukocyte common antigen isoform, CD45RO) (Bertotto et al., 1990; Wirt et al., 1992), and that type of T cell is the principal producer of interferon-\u03b3 (Berlotto et al., 1990; Sanders et al., 1988).",

There is evidence from experimental animal studies that milk lymphocytes enter tissues of the neonate (Head et al., 1977; Jain et al., 1989; Schnorr and Pearson, 1984; Weiler et al., 1983), but that has not been demonstrated in humans. In that regard, comparisons between the phenotypic expression of CD45RO on T cells in the blood of breast-fed and nonbreast-fed infants will be of interest. In addition, further studies are in order of the pattern of antigens to which these T cells respond (Parmeley et al., 1976) and the repertoire of the T cell antigen receptors of those cells in human milk.",

            "text": "One of the extraordinary features of the protection afforded by human milk is the virtual absence of clinical signs of inflammation during the gastrointestinal infections. This may be due in part to the more rapid elimination or neutralization of microbial pathogens in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract by defense agents from human milk, but other features of human milk suggest that this is not the sole explanation. Phlogistic agents and the systems that give rise to them are poorly represented in human milk. In addition, human milk contains a host of antiinflammatory agents (Goldman et al., 1986; Goldman et al., 1989b), some that double as antimicrobial factors (lactoferrin, secretory IgA, and lysozyme). The major classes of these anti-inflammatory agents in human milk include factors that promote the growth of epithelium, such as Cortisol (Kulski et al., 1981), epithelial growth factor (Carpenter, 1980), polyamines (Romain et al., 1992), and lactoferrin (Nichols et al., 1987), antioxidants (ascorbate-like compound, uric acid, \u03b2-carotene), and agents that inhibit nonoxidative inflammatory systems such as prostaglandins (Nen et al., 1988) and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (Furukawa et al., 1992). Like the antimicrobial factors, these factors are well adapted to operate in the hostile environment of the alimentary tract.",

Supporting epidemiologic evidence for that premise has been mounting for several years. The incidence of juvenile diabetes mellitus (Mayer et al., 1988) and Crohn's disease (Koletsko et al., 1989) appears to be less among children who have been breast-fed during infancy. In addition, a recent retrospective analysis suggests that breast-feeding lessens the risk from lymphomas (Davis et al., 1988). In each study, considerable reliance has been placed upon the abilities of mothers to recall the type and duration of feeding given to their offspring; yet, recall of events that transpired many years beforehand may be suspect. Undoubtedly, prospective studies of the possible long-term protective role of human milk will be required to further explore the possible long-term benefits of human milk.",

The production of IgA at mucosal sites may be enhanced by human milk (Goldblum et al., 1989; Prentice, 1987; Schanler et al., 1986; Stephens, 1986; Stephens et al., 1984). Although in most of those studies it has been difficult to exclude the effect of passively transferred secretory IgA, in two investigations the excretion of IgA was increased in the urinary tract, a system removed from direct contact with human milk (Goldblum et al., 1989; Prentice, 1987). Furthermore, in one report the urinary excretion of free secretory component was also remarkably increased in infants fed human milk (Goldblum et al., 1989). The M\nr of these proteins far exceeds the size of molecules filtered by glomeruli and neither secretory component nor secretory IgA are transported from the systemic circulation into external secretions by epithelial cells. It is, therefore, likely that human milk feedings stimulated the synthesis of secretory component by epithelial cells in the urinary tract and that this, in turn, enhanced the transport of secretory IgA into the urine of the infants. The components in human milk that may be responsible for such an enhancement are undetermined at this time.",

The response of breast-fed and nonbreast-fed infants to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection was compared by measuring their serum interferon-\u03b1 levels (Chiba et al., 1987). The serum levels of interferon-\u03b1 were strikingly increased in breast-fed infants in the first 2\u20134 weeks after RSV infection. Since there is little interferon-\u03b1 in human milk, it seems likely that human milk is able to prime leukocytes in the host to produce that cytokine. In addition, there is evidence that the plasma concentrations of fibronectin are higher in breast-fed than nonbreast-fed infants (237 and 17/mg/liter, respectively) (Friss et al., 1988). Since the amount of ingested fibronectin is not sufficient to account for the increment in plasma fibronectin that has been observed, it seems likely that human milk induces the synthesis of that opsonin in the infant.",

            "text": "The last piece of evidence comes from discoveries of immunomodulators in human milk. Human milk contains a high concentration of \u03b1-tocopherol, an agent which, in addition to its antioxidant effects, is known to stimulate the development of immunity (Bendich et al., 1983, 1984, 1986; Tengerdy et al., 1981). Several glycoproteins that orchestrate the development and functions of the immune system have been found in human milk. These agents, termed cytokines, require only minute quantities to be bioactive. Moreover, there are many interrelationships between those agents. The cytokines and their concentrations (mean values unless otherwise indicated) in early human milk are (1) interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) (\u20131130 pg/ml) (Munoz et al., 1990), (2) IL-6 (-150 pg/ml) (Saito et al., 1991; Rudloff et al., 1993), (3) IL-8 (\u223c3680 pg/ml) (Palkowetz et al., 1994), (4) IL-10 (\u223c3300 pg/ml) (Garofalo et al., 1995), (5) tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (\u223c620 pg/ml) (Mushtaha et al., 1989; Rudloff et al., 1992), and (6) transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (\u223c130 pg/ml) (Noda et al., 1984; Palkowetz et al., 1994), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (45\u20131554 pg/ml) (Gilmore et al., 1994), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Hara et al., 1995). The effects of these agents in human milk on the recipient infant are as yet unknown, but it is likely that they will influence the development of the defenses of the respiratory and alimentary tract.",

Although considerable progress has been made toward defining many aspects of the defense system in human milk, further research will be required to identify the entire system, unravel the molecular biology and mechanisms of production and secretion, and determine the discrete role of each component of the system in the defense of the mammary gland or the recipient infant. In the process, it will continue to be important to anticipate that the ultimate role of these defense agents may depend upon a multiplicity of interactions with other factors in the system found in milk or with defense agents or cells produced by the breast-fed infant.",
