Buddhist practitioners have entered the field creating opportunities for Christian-Buddhist dialogue. Transgender US citizens are especially vulnerable to medical, social, and spiritual neglect in health care settings due to policy changes in the Department of Health and Human Services. Christians are also vulnerable to the manipulation of basic Christian principles by Trump and Pence. Buddhist-Christian dialogue can strengthen compassionate care and promote public practical theology for transgender hospital patients.",

            "text": "Prescript. Years before I began writing this book, I anticipated President Trump would be impeached. He was impeached on December 18, 2019. COVID-19 was reported to the World Health Organization in late December of that year. Trump was acquitted on February 5, 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic continued ravaging humanity. Before attention was paid to Trump's dealings with Ukraine, and before COVID-19 reared its ugly head, our government targeted transgender people in nearly every facet and sector of American life. At the time of writing, COVID-19 is demanding something different from us-a political system that is transparent, responsive to public health concerns, economically nimble, and ceases the targeting of politically-vulnerable citizens. At this time, governments across the globe are aware of the desperate necessity of garnering nearly every possible resource to protect humanity from the scourge of the coronavirus. No country will \"go it alone\" and thrive. Communicable diseases remind us that we are all in this together, and spiritual care providers must attend to political situations outside our clinical contexts. What happens outside impacts what happens inside. Medical professionals (many of whom are wearing garbage bags for protective gear) are putting their lives as risk, and some are dying. This is a tragedy and travesty. Impeachment reminds us that the President is accountable to the US Constitution and Trump's acquittal reminds us that in this Administration, foreign nationals are invited to meddle in our electoral processes without real consequence. Moreover, I hope these situations remind us, intergenerationally, that our survival as a species depends on recognizing and honoring our interdependence across gender, gender expression, sex, sexuality, sexual expressions, and all forms of human expression. This is what the Parable of the Good Samaritan or the Parable of Our Collective Survival, teaches us. Are we ready to learn?",

They represent the kinds of people Jesus talked about in The Parable of the Good Samaritan. Millions of Americans receive their primary spiritual care from \"good Samaritan\" chaplains, 1 but chaplains are not known for collectively speaking out on behalf of the oppressed. I argue that pastoral and spiritual caregivers need to be involved in democratic institutions beyond voting; as educated, critically thinking spiritual leaders they hold the potential to wisely engage in the democratic process in ways that can contribute wisdom and compassion in the protection of minority rights while respecting religious freedom. Unfortunately, many spiritual care professionals are not prepared for such critical involvement because seminary education and Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) are typically not infused with legal education. How might chaplains, spiritual caregivers, pastoral counselors, and chaplain educators with some education in US religious freedom law read Christian scriptures differently? More importantly, how might these spiritual caregivers and educators act differently?",

The lawyer understands the law in this way: One must love God with every fiber of one's being and love one's neighbor as one loves oneself. Jesus affirms the lawyer's understanding. Digging deeper, as good lawyers tend to do, the lawyer asks for Jesus's definition of the word \"neighbor.\" Jesus tells the lawyer a story, a parable, about a man who is severely beaten and left for dead, even by religious leaders who see the dying man and cross to the other side of the road. A Samaritan, someone not esteemed in any religious or ethnic way, a commoner, perhaps even someone oppressed, gives the dying man aid and takes him to an inn for care. He pays the innkeeper, offering to pay even more than requested. The innkeeper takes the man into his care. After Jesus tells the story, he turns the question back on the lawyer, asking for his definition of the word \"neighbor.\" The lawyer responds by equating the word neighbor with the Samaritan-a neighbor is one who shows mercy, as the Samaritan showed mercy upon the dying man. Jesus affirms the answer and instructs the lawyer to do likewise. 2 We do not know the end of the story; we don't discover how the lawyer enacts or does not enact Jesus's instruction. We do, however, know the story of a challenge to Jesus's message, a challenge that is taking place in contemporary America. The Trump-Pence administration, in the name of Christianity, is currently flouting the Good Samaritan ethos. Why?",

These evangelicals sought political access and power they certainly would not have found with Trump's opponent, liberal Protestant, feminist Hillary Rodham Clinton, a former first lady, US Senator, and secretary of state. Though candidate Trump did not espouse discrimination against transgender citizens in the presidential debates, the base brought their anti-LGBTQ and especially their anti-transgender agenda to his presidency. With the help of Russian meddling in social media and voting systems, Trump, despite his non-Christian lifestyle, became the darling of some Christian evangelicals, not to mention some African-American Christian pastors and many white nationalists, some of whom were and are in the Trump-Pence administration.

Just shy of a month in office, his administration eliminated federal protections that allowed transgender students to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. 3 About one year later, President Trump said on Religious Freedom Day, Our Constitution and laws guarantee Americans the right not just to believe as they see fit, but to freely exercise their religion. \u2026 No American-whether a nun, nurse, baker, or business owner-should be forced to choose between the tenets of faith or adherence to the law. 4 A Christian nun would not struggle between the tenets of her faith and The Parable, because The Parable is a part of her faith. A nurse would not struggle between The Parable and their profession, because The Parable is part of their profession. Through the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, this country seeks to ensure that all citizens are treated as endowed with the same substance, thereby recognizing that no one is better than or more entitled to rights than anyone else. Under the Fourteenth Amendment, bakers and other business owners offering their services and products to the public may not deny their services and products to different classes of people; but that is indeed happening, and it is happening legally. The Parable is under attack in the name of religious freedom, but the Good Samaritans in our midst can use the power of the principle to re-imagine The Parable beyond its focus on the goodness of one human toward another human. I will return to the process of this re-imaging in Chap. 6.",

Harris-Perry, though not considered by many to be a theologian per se, advocates in a theologically sophisticated, compelling, and multi-faceted manner for sexualityoppressed people. She is an inspiration for chaplains and spiritual care professionals seeking to take their ministries of compassion to the streets, within the academy, and throughout the airwaves. As a political scientist, she is also an exemplar for public practical theological leadership. Leadership matters.

            "text": "Being hospitable is a value shared by all major religious traditions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism; being hospitable, or having the ability to be a host, is the very action out of which hospitals and hospices were originally founded. The word \"hospital\" is derived from \"ospital,\" meaning, \"hostel, shelter, lodging.\" 9 Indeed, churches and religious organizations were the first creators of hospitals, which were primarily intended for serving poor people. 10 Chaplains serve as hosts in hospitals and hospices; they provide hospitality in the form of religious and spiritual support, when requested. In A Ministry of Presence: Chaplaincy, Spiritual Care, and the Law, Winnifred Fallers Sullivan offers that chaplains are \"trained by religious communities [to] minister to a clientele often unmarked at that moment by any specific religious identity, and they do so on behalf of a secular institution bound, at least theoretically, to rational epistemologies. \u2026 The chaplain has, without paradox, become a priest of the secular \u2026 attempt[ing] to integrate universalist and particularist understandings of the flourishing of human beings under the banner of religious freedom.\" 11 Sullivan also claims, \"The new 'clinical' chaplaincy has a different role and a different purpose. The chaplain has now become a member of the medical team.\" 12 Consequently, as a member of the medical team, utilizing a ministry of presence, Each [chaplain] experiences the intimate and immediate face of death and dying and the insistent presence of difficult moral decisions. But they share much with other forms of chaplaincy today. The diversity of their clientele, the ambiguity of lines of authority, the transience of the encounter, and, above all, the pressure to work in a radically undefined setting religiously speaking, and a rapidly deconstructing religious field-while justifying that work using the seductively scientistic language of spiritual assessment and care-characterizes the work that chaplains do in every place. Chaplains are at a particularly interesting and focused interface between church, state, society, and a rapidly changing religious terrain. 13 Due to the fact that chaplains are educated in, exposed to, and trained in a variety of disciplines, including theology and critical analysis of sacred texts, professional chaplains know that interpreting The Parable against vulnerable patients is a gross perversion. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) created an Office for Civil Rights (OCR) enforcement mechanism called the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division (CRFD) to enable health care employees to file complaints online if they cannot remove themselves from caring for people they do not like, in the name of religion. It is estimated that this initiative will cost hundreds of millions of dollars every year. It is estimated that the cost to implement CRFD is $900,000, that it will cost $312.3 million this year, and $125.5 million every year. Are our health care systems able to survive such financial losses? 14 The Trump-Pence administration is also promoting vigilante justice by inviting people to file complaints on another's behalf without their knowledge or permission. Can you image, for example, a member of a religion that despises white people removing herself from caring for all white patients in a hospital? Should she be entitled to keep her job? Can you imagine a white hospice worker belonging to a religion that espouses white supremacy removing himself from the care of all people of color? Can you imagine a Jewish health care clinic employee who believes that neo-Nazis should not be provided treatment because they advocate violence having the right to refuse to provide care? Should a Roman Catholic priest who is a chaplain be able to exercise his religious freedom by performing an exorcism on anyone he deems in need? Whether it is the individual hospital, hospice, or clinic employee with their particular belief systems encountering individual patients who fall outside the net of love and compassion of their religious, spiritual, and ethical systems, should the entire hospital, hospice, or clinic be denied federal funding based on those religious differences?",

Sullivan says, Decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court in the last couple of decades have shifted the Court's interpretation of the religion clauses of the First Amendment away from the high separationism of the middle part of the twentieth century toward a jurisprudence that increasingly sees religion as being neither particularly threatening nor particularly in need of protection. 15 Is this neutral attitude shifting more toward protection?

In Chap. 2, \"Spiritual Care and Political Involvement, Womanist Public Theology and Boston Medical Center,\" I utilize the life and work of black feminist, womanist-influenced, African-American public intellectual Melissa Harris-Perry to illustrate how one might engage citizenship through being a scholar, a journalist, an advocate, and a theologian. In Chap. 2, I also examine and analyze the data from three surveys-one with chaplains, one with pastoral counselors, and the other with chaplain educators-all related to religious freedom issues, spiritual care, and education. I conducted these surveys to arrive at a sense of what some chaplains, pastoral counselors, and chaplain educators really think about religious freedom law and determine if CPE programs incorporate religious freedom law literacy in their curricula. In addition to the surveys, I include a brief case study on the Clinical Pastoral Education program at Boston Medical Center's Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery.

When I think about interreligious dialogue, I imagine two parties from different religious traditions engaged with each other on matters vital to their religious belief systems, with the knowledge that the other possesses different beliefs, with a desire to know the other more deeply in order to cohabitate more peaceably. Judith Butler writes about cohabitation, specifically in the Israel-Palestine context: Cohabitation forms the ethical basis for a public critique of those forms of state violence that seek to produce and maintain the Jewish character of the state through the radical disenfranchisement and decimation of its minority, through occupation, assault, or legal restriction. These are attacks on a subjugated minority, but they are also attacks on the value of cohabitation. 18",

Conceptual Dialogue is when dialogue partners limit their communications to the realm of concepts, discussing whether there is a concept of heaven in Buddhism, for example, or discussing why Christians believe they can live forever, as another example. Buddhist-Christian Interior Dialogue comes as the result of dialogue partners sharing their experiences of contemplation, prayer, and meditation. Buddhist-Christian Socially Engaged Dialogue has to do with matters of justice, peace making, and action.

Regarding Conceptual Dialogue, Ingram says, The focus of Conceptual Dialogue is doctrinal, theological, and philosophical. It concerns a religious tradition's collective self-understanding and worldview. In Conceptual Dialogue, Buddhists and Christians compare theological and philosophical formulations on such questions as ultimate reality, human nature, suffering and evil, the role of Jesus in Christian faith, the role of the Buddha in Buddhist practice, and what Christians and Buddhists can conceptually learn from one another. 22 It should be noted here that no matter the concepts under investigation, a Buddhist's ethical duty is to know the concept and detach from it. Nhat Hanh states, Life is so precious, too precious to lose just because of these notions and concepts. \u2026 Concepts like \"nirvana,\" \"Buddha,\" \"Pure Land,\" \"Kingdom of God,\" and \"Jesus\" are just concepts; we have to be very careful. We should not start a war and destroy people because of our concepts. 23 Certain contexts can support Conceptual Dialogue, like courses and intentional dialogue groups, where time is permitted for the unfolding of doctrine, theology, and philosophy from at least two distinct traditions. The more diverse the traditions, the greater the chances for one to be able to articulate one's own theology and engage others with different theologies. 24 Chaplains-in-training, as well as those who are already on the job, typically do not have the luxury of time. Despite the busy nature of many hospital settings, it would be wise to make time for Buddhist-Christian Spiritual Care Dialogue related to transgender patients. Christian and Buddhist chaplains could begin their dialogues with religious anthropologies, asking questions like, What is a person? Can a person experience illness? Pain? Can a person experience healing? A cure? What is sex? What is gender? What about the body is \"sacred,\" as in, not to be changed? What about a person is permanent? Is a transgender person a \"person?\" Is a cisgender person a \"person?\" In short, what about Christianity tells you this being is a person? What about Buddhism tells you this being is a person? How does this square with the Buddhist concepts of no self or nonself?",

In the process, the natural sciences inspire wonder and, for most scientists and many faithful participants throughout the world's religious traditions, great reverence. 25 Ingram is aware of how frightening this prospect is for some Christians, especially those who believe in the concept of \"intelligent design\": individual organs (like the human eye) and ecologically sensitive species (like bees and flowers) cannot evolve through the sort of minute random steps described by Darwin. To survive, Agassiz argued, each modification must be beneficial. But complex organs and organic relationships only work as a whole. They cannot develop in steps. So he proposed that complex organisms reflect intelligent design, and thus, testify to both the existence and reality of God. 26 It is this concept and its impulse that contributes to physical, verbal, and emotional aggression as well as the medical neglect of some transgender patients. Intelligent Design Christian chaplains, in a trialogue with natural science and Nhat Hanh's Buddhist teachings, might ask the question, \"If the transgender being is a person engaged in intentionally and actively destroying God's intelligent design, how can I be compassionate toward them?\" A Buddhist chaplain might ask a Christian chaplain who is an adherent of Intelligent Design, \"How can I come to understand gender as something more than a mental construct, something of real importance?\" They all may ponder why both sexes have testosterone and estrogen and that hormonal levels change over time. These questions are not meant to be prescribed, but are offered as examples of how to think about natural science and religion together, while keeping in mind the fact that there is a person, or people, in our midst in need of immediate attention.",

Justice is a central theological category in Christian social activist traditions, but the notion of justice has not played an equivalent role in Buddhism. Christian tradition gives priority to loving engagement with the world as the foundation of establishing justice. So for Christians, the question is to what extent is nonviolent compassion toward all sentient beings, even to aggressors doing harm to whole communities of persons, itself an occasion for injustice? 28 Buddhist chaplains might ask, \"If you say God is love, that Jesus is love, and you commit acts of violence against others, even to save others, is that justifiable?\" A Christian chaplain might ask, \"How is it compassionate to be a witness to someone else's harm when you could have intervened, but chose not to?\" A Buddhist chaplain might ask, \"Here we have a transgender patient living in a society that is dangerous. What is your role in advocating for safety for them?\" The Christian chaplain might ask, \"How can I advocate for those I do not love?\" Again, these questions are meant to be examples, not prescriptions. Chaplains of different religions (and no religions) work together to meet the needs of those in their care. In order to offer the most appropriate care possible, they need to talk to one another, know one another, become conversant in other \"religion languages,\" and be able to call on their colleagues when they think they are unable, in the moment, to serve a patient.

Nhat Hanh says, I have noticed that Christians and Buddhists who have lived deeply their contemplative lives always come to express themselves in more non-dualistic, nondogmatic ways. Christian mystics and Zen masters never sound speculative or intellectual. Their speculative minds have given way to a nondiscursive spirit. Because they have learned not to get caught in notions or representations, they do not speak as though they alone hold the truth, and they do not think that those in other traditions are going the wrong way. 29 Dialogue partners share what they experience. Ingram writes, Buddhist doctrines guide the practice of meditation in all schools of Buddhism. The purpose of Buddhist meditation is to purify the mind of mental distortions caused by clinging to permanence so that one can apprehend the \"Emptiness\" (sunyata) of things and events and thereby not cling to delusions, particularly the delusion of permanent selfhood. Accomplishing this requires a powerfully-concentrated mind. While there exists a plurality of meditative disciplines, five common assumptions guide Buddhist practice traditions, including 1. Since the development of mindfulness requires the avoidance of negative activities \u2026 ethics is the foundation. 2. Meditation can be practiced by concentrating on just one object. 3. Meditation can be analytical \u2026 through which the reasons and supporting attitudes and emotions \u2026 can be apprehended and replaced by nonegoistic emotions. 4. Meditation may also be a reflection on the various levels of a spiritual path. 5. Meditation may involve visualization techniques, chanting mantras, or simply focusing on one's breathing or a koan. 30",

Secondly, it creates a new psyche in one's self-a very disrupted, distracted, terrorized person, the opposite of a stable, self-aware person. Two aspects, one fear. If one's soul is so enslaved as to bow to the god, one is already destroyed. 38 Berrigan and Nhat Hanh engaged in Interreligious Dialogue on Government. They talked about the risks of priests (arguably any religious or spiritual leader) becoming elected officials because of the risks of losing their moral compass and pastoral authority because of the compromises they must make to keep their political jobs as they return favors for votes. Chaplains, even as \"secular priests\" who work in governmental facilities, such as governmentally funded health care institutions, face similar risks of moral injuries when they do not engage in Interreligious Dialogue about Government and their roles as government agents. One way chaplains can avoid losing their moral compass and maintain their pastoral authority is by voicing their opinions in the public sphere about politicians promulgating religious freedom laws to discriminate against minority populations.",

Such a chaplain is looking for the same benefits [my emphasis]; he goes up the ladder the way the guards do in salary and in rank, and he retires with a pension, just as they do. This can't help but affect his relationship to the prisoners. In fact, Philip [Daniel's brother] and I have never met a prison chaplain whom we could respect. Not one. 39 Chaplains, especially cisgender chaplains in health care contexts caring for transgender patients, can ask ourselves similar questions about our cisgender privileges vis-\u00e0-vis the health care institutions we are admitted. Why does being cisgender permit us to be cared for? We can ask ourselves in what way or ways do we partner with institutions to diminish the trans patients we serve and ask ourselves if we are doling out \"cheap grace\" to those patients rather than spiritual care of little transformative value? In other words, have cisgender chaplains become complicit with health care systems of trans oppression if we are not resisting discriminatory policies and laws?",

We could no longer look upon our style of life as merely being an occasion for this or that action. People had to begin thinking much more seriously and deeply about a long-term struggle in which they would stand up more visibly and perhaps with more risk. \u2026 One person refusing induction or going on trial or leaving the university would have no impact. Now there must be a community behind him. 40 Nhat Hanh: I think that's a very meaningful term. And resistance [my emphasis], at root, I think, must mean more than resistance against war. It is a resistance against all kinds of things that are like war. Because living in modern society, one feels that he cannot easily retain integrity, wholeness. One is robbed permanently of humanness, the capacity of being oneself. \u2026 So perhaps, first of all, resistance means you lose yourself. So perhaps, first of all, resistance means opposition to being invaded, occupied, assaulted, and destroyed by the system. The purpose of resistance, here, is to seek the healing of yourself in order to be able to see clearly. 41",

But in nirvana, which is the ground of being equivalent to God, there is no birth, no death, no coming, no going, no being, no non-being. All these concepts must be transcended. 42 In nirvana, the dualistic \"concepts\" of male or female and the \"concept\" transgender are transcended. It is likely Paul, Jesus's apostle, would have agreed. In The Letter of Paul to the Galatians, he says, For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ's then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. 43 In Paul's letter to Colossians, he says, But now you yourselves are to put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language out of your mouth. Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all and in all. 44 Nhat Hanh and Paul, like the Buddha and Jesus, are mystical kinfolk of non-dualistic, unifying consciousness that fades away, lessens in importance, loses its power to separate and discriminate, loses its hierarchal meanings, yet brings spirit-world beings together as one. Christian and Buddhist chaplains in dialogue about caring for transgender patients can expand the field of compassionate care by engaging in dialogue about their respective unifying spiritual practices that promote nondiscrimination and support one another in those practices while staying within their religious homes, radically co-inhabiting the clinical space of the pluralistic hospital setting. A true cohabitation of constructive interreligious dialogue that incorporates wisdom, compassion, constitutional vigilance, advocacy, activism, care, and analysis will likely shock a health care system out of fear of, hatred toward, ignorance about, and neglect of caring for transgender patients into a system striving to be hospitable toward all.",
