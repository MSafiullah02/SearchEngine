Indeed, the six degrees of separation may suggest that a highly infectious disease could spread to all six billion people living in the earth about size incubation periods of the diseases [14] .

Different from the pure quarantine approach, here individuals can still perform in the network system, though some contact relationships are forbidden. In other words, instead of removing vertices (individuals) form a network as in the quarantine approach, this strategy focuses on removing edges so that the (potential) outbreaks can be slowed down. Intuitively, if an individual contacts less number of other individuals, the chance for him or her to spread or being infected from the disease (misinformation) becomes less. From the network viewpoint, the edge-removal strategy essentially make the underlying (social) network less small-world, or simply \"de-small-world\", i.e., the distances between individuals increase to delay the spreading process. In many situations, such a strategy is often easily and even voluntarily adopted. For instance, during the SARS epidemic in Beijing, 2004, there are much less people appearing in the public places. This approach can also be deployed in complement to the quarantine approach.",

Clearly, different edges (interactions) in the network are not being equivalent in terms of slowing down any potential outbreak: for a given individual, a link to an individual of high degree connection can be more dangerous than a link to another one with low degree connection. The edge importance (in terms of distance) especially coincides with Kleighnberg's theoretical model [9] which utilizes the long-range edges on top of an underlying grid for explaining the small-world phenomenon. In this model, the long-range edges are the main factors which help connect the otherwise long-distance pairs with a smaller number of edges. However, there are no direct studies in fitting such a model to the real world graph to discover those long-range edges. In the mean time, additional constraint, such as the number of edges can be removed from the network, may exist because removing an edge can associate with certain cost. These factors and requirements give arise to the following fundamental research problem: how can we maximally de-small-world a graph (making a graph to be less small-world) by removing a fixed number of edges?",

            "text": "Problem Formulation. In order to model the edge-removal process and formally define the de-small-world network problem, a criterion is needed to precisely capture the degree of being small-world. Note that here the goal is to help prevent and/or delay the potential outbreak and epidemic process. The typical measure of small-world network is based on the average distance (the average length of the shortest path between any pair of vertices in the entire network). However, this measure is not able to provide unified treatment of the connected and cut network. Specifically, assuming a connected network is broken into several cut network and the average distance on the cut network is not easy to express. On the other hand, we note that the de-small-world network graph problem is different from the network decomposition (clustering) problem which tries to break the entire network into several components (connected subgraphs). From the outbreak prevention and delaying perspective, the cost of network decomposition is too high and may not be effective. This is because each individual component itself may still be small-world; and the likelihood of completely separating the contagious/infected group from the rest of populations (the other components) is often impossible. Given this, we introduce the average neighborhood size as a new measure for the degree of being small-world and utilize it to formally define the de-smallworld network problem. Especially, the new measure can not only uniformly treat both connected and cut networks and aims to directly help model the spreading/diffusion process. Simply speaking, for each vertex v in a network G = (V, E) where V is the vertex set and E is the edge set, we define the neighborhood of v as the number of vertices with distance no greater than k to v, denoted as N k (v). Here k is the user-specified spreading (or delaying) parameter which aims to measure the outbreak speed, i.e., in a specified time unit, the maximum distance between individual u (source) to another one v (destination) who can be infected if u is infected. Thus, the average neighborhood size of G, v\u2208V N k (v), can be used to measure the robustness of the network with respect to a potential outbreak in a certain time framework. Clearly, a potential problem of the small-world network is that even for a small k, the average neighborhood size can be still rather large, indicating a large (expected) number of individuals can be quickly affected (within time framework k) during an outbreak process.",

For simplicity, we do not study those extensions in this work; though our approaches can be in general extended to handle those additional parameters. In addition, we note that in our problem, we require the spreading parameter k > 1. This is because for k = 1, this problem is trivial: the average neighborhood size is equivalent to the average vertex degree; and removing any edge has the same effect. In other words, when k = 1, the neighborhood criterion does not capture the spreading or cascading effects of the small-world graph.

Here, the short betweenness SB(e) thus provide an upper bound (or approximation) on |g(e)| (assuming all other edges are presented in the graph); and measures the the edge potential in removing those local reachable pairs.

The size of E s has to be larger than L; in general, we can assume |E s | = \u03b1L, where \u03b1 > 1. In the experimental evaluation (Sect. 5), we found when \u03b1 = 5, the performance of using candidate set is almost as good as the original algorithm which uses the entire edge variables. Once the candidate set edge set is selected, we make the following simple observation: Clearly, if there is one path in P (u, v) does not contain an edge in E s , it will always linked no matter how we select E r and thus cannot cut by E r \u2286 E s . In other words, (u, v) has to be cut by E s if it can be cut by E r . Given this, we introduce R s = R G \u2286 R G\\Es .

Specifically, OM W is always slightly better than SB.",

In addition, we introduce the short-betweenness to speed up our algorithm. The empirical study demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our approaches. In the future, we plan to utilize MapReduce framework (e.g. Hadoop) to scale our methods to handle graphs with tens of millions of vertices.",
