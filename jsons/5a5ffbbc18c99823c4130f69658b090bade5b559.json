We assessed the role of viral infections and nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage in ARTIs in E\u00f1epa Amerindians from Venezuela. Methods: In 40 children aged 0e10 years with ARTIs, healthy nearest-age sibling controls and their mothers the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae/ psittachi and 15 respiratory viruses was investigated. Results: S. pneumoniae was the most frequently detected pathogen, with carriage rates of 75% and 38% in children and mothers respectively. In children, S. pneumoniae carriage was associated with ARTI risk in multivariate analysis (OR 14.1, 95% CI 1.4e137.7). Viral infections were not associated with ARTI risk. S. pneumoniae carriage was common in children of all ages while viral co-infections were more frequently present in children under 4 years compared to older children (46% vs. 17%, p < 0.01). An increase of one unit height-for-age Z score (i.e. improved chronic nutritional status) was associated with decreased odds of S. pneumoniae colonization in multivariate analysis (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44e0.99).

In a population-based birth cohort study performed in Australia, pneumonia rates in Aboriginal children were 13.5 times higher than in non-Aboriginal children (95% CI 12.8e14.4). 10 In the United States, The ALRTI-associated hospitalization rate was 3-fold higher for American Indian/Alaska Native children than for the general U.S. population in retrospective analyses. 11, 12 The high prevalence rates of ARTIs, including ALRTIs and acute otitis media (AOM), in Australian and North American native children have been associated with increased carriage of viral and bacterial respiratory tract pathogens compared to non-natives. 13e18 While in Australia, Canada and the U.S. native populations make up only two to four percent of the population, ten percent of the South American population consists of indigenous people. 19e21 There is a lack of health research reports concerning the principal clinical presentations and infectious etiologies of ARTIs in indigenous people from the South American region. 19 The E\u00f1epa (or Panare) Amerindians inhabit the Cede\u00f1o Municipality of the Venezuelan state of Bol\u00edvar, characterized by a forest-savanna landscape.

The high S. pneumoniae colonization rate in E\u00f1epa Amerindians increases the size of the pneumococcal reservoir in these communities. As in these populations approximately half of the population is less than 15 years of age, those children aged 5e10 years represent a sizeable fraction of the total population and one that is likely to interact frequently with young children who are most susceptible to the development of disease after nasopharyngeal colonization. 5 Carriage rates of S. pneumoniae in E\u00f1epa mothers were extremely high (38%) compared to the carriage rates of 7%e 9% that are observed in mothers and other close adult contacts in cross-sectional studies from industrialized as well as rural areas. 45e47 A previously performed study in the E\u00f1epa Amerindian population during the dry season showed a prevalence of S. pneumoniae colonization in mothers of children under 5 years of age of only 11%. 48 This suggests that the high prevalence observed in our study was due to seasonal influences. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated seasonal variations in the rate of pneumococcal colonization and rainy season has been identified as a significant risk factor for S. pneumoniae carriage in children and adults. 16, 44, 49, 50 However, the prevalence of S. pneumoniae colonization observed in healthy E\u00f1epa children under 5 years of age in the previous study (69%) was similar to the rate we observed in healthy controls up to 5 years of age (70%). Another possible explanation for the high carriage rate in mothers in our study is the observation that in 81% of the S. pneumoniae positive mothers, pneumococci were only isolated from the oropharyngeal sample. In the previously performed study, oropharyngeal samples were not taken. 48 The percentage of S. pneumoniae positive children in which S. pneumoniae was isolated from the oropharyngeal sample alone was lower (12%). The importance of oropharyngeal sampling for detection of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in children and mothers was previously demonstrated by Greenberg et al. 22 However, in contrast to their findings, in our study no H. influenzae was isolated from the oropharyngeal sample alone. This might be due to the high number of children with ARTI in our study, as H. influenzae detection in the nasopharyngeal swab increased during illness in the study of Greenberg et al. 22 We did not study the molecular characteristics of identified pathogens. As HRV was the viral infection with the highest prevalence in our study population, it would be of interest to perform phylogenetic analysis of the HRV strains circulating in this population in order to compare the strains detected in this area with published HRV sequences from other parts of the world. 51 Respiratory viruses were, however, not significantly associated with ARTIs in our study.

In a longitudinal study including South Indian infants, S. pneumoniae carriage was significantly associated with increased odds of chronic malnutrition (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3e7.4), suggesting that S. pneumoniae colonization affects growth. 52 In Bangladesh, immunization of infants with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was independently associated with an increase in height-for-age. 53 Acute malnutrition was significantly associated with ARTI risk in our study. A significant relationship between acute malnutrition and respiratory tract infections has also been observed in other studies and undernutrition, either acute or chronic, negatively affects disease outcome. 1,54e56 While bacterial colonization was not associated with the age of the child in our study, children with viral-bacterial co-occurrence were significantly younger than children with bacterial colonization alone. A mixed nasopharyngeal flora containing respiratory viruses and bacteria was also significantly more often observed in children under 4 years of age compared to children aged 5e8 years in Greenland. 39 Interestingly, we did not observe a significant association of respiratory viral infections with ARTI risk. In studies performed in developed countries, viruses have been identified as the potential etiological cause in more than half of the ARTI cases. 57, 58 It is important to know the relative contributions of viruses and bacteria to the burden of ARTI and AOM in different populations to ensure appropriate population-specific case management and preventive strategies, including vaccination.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 602, "end": 604, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 754, "end": 756, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1049, "text": "1,54e56", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1459, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1714, "end": 1717, "text": "57,", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1718, "end": 1720, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Conclusions from the present study must be tempered by an appreciation of limitations.

Additionally, the magnitude of the associations between demographic and nutritional variables and S. pneumoniae colonization in our study may differ from the effect magnitude in the general population as our study population was not a representative sample of the general population of E\u00f1epa Amerindian children due to the caseecontrol study design. Finally, confidence intervals of the OR determined in multivariate analyses of factors associated with ARTI and S. pneumoniae colonization were wide due to the small sample size of our study.
