It differs from other respiratory viruses in that it appears that human-tohuman transmission occurs approximately 2 to 10 days prior to the individual becoming symptomatic. [2] [3] [4] The virus is transmitted from person to person through respiratory secretions. Large droplets from coughing, sneezing or rhinorrhoea land on surfaces within 2 m of the infected person. SARS-CoV-2 remains viable for at least 24 hours on hard surfaces and up to 8 hours on soft surfaces. 5 The virus is transferred to another person through hand contact on a contaminated surface followed by touching the mouth, nose or eyes. Aerosol airborne infected particles created during a sneeze or cough remain viable in the air for 3 hours. 5 These airborne particles of SARS-CoV-2 can then be inhaled by another person or land on the mucosal membranes of the eyes.",

            "text": "Individuals with COVID-19 can present with an influenza-like illness and respiratory tract infection demonstrating fever (89%), cough (68%), fatigue (38%), sputum production (34%) and/or shortness of breath (19%). 4 The spectrum of disease severity ranges from asymptomatic infection or mild upper respiratory tract illness through to severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and/or death. Current reports estimate that 80% of cases are asymptomatic or mild; 15% of cases are severe (infection requiring oxygen); and 5% are critical requiring ventilation and life support. 2 Preliminary reports indicate that chest radiographs may have diagnostic limitations in COVID-19. 6 Clinicians need to be aware that lung computed tomography (CT) scan findings often include multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity. 7 Lung ultrasound is also being used at the bedside with findings of multi-lobar distribution of Blines and diffuse lung consolidation. 8 The current mortality rate is 3 to 5%, with new reports of up to 9%, which is in contrast to influenza at around 0.1%. 2 The rates of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) are approximately 5%. 4 Around 42% of patients admitted to hospital will require oxygen therapy. 4 Based on emerging data, individuals at highest risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease requiring hospitalisation and/or ICU support are those who are older, male, have at least one co-existing comorbidity, higher severity of illness scores (measured via SOFA scores), elevated D-dimer levels and/or lymphocytopenia. 2, 4, [9] [10] [11] Purpose This document has been prepared to provide information to physiotherapists and acute care healthcare facilities about the potential role of physiotherapy in the management of hospital-admitted patients with confirmed or suspected COVID- 19. Physiotherapists who work in primary healthcare facilities are likely to have a role in the management of patients admitted to hospital with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Physiotherapy is an established profession throughout the world. Globally, physiotherapists often work in acute hospital wards and ICUs. In particular, cardiorespiratory physiotherapy focuses on the management of acute and chronic respiratory conditions and aims to improve physical recovery following an acute illness. Physiotherapy may be beneficial in the respiratory treatment and physical rehabilitation of patients with COVID-19. Although a productive cough is a less common symptom (34%), 4 physiotherapy may be indicated if patients with COVID-19 present with copious airway secretions that they are unable to clear independently. This may be evaluated on a case-bycase basis and interventions applied based on clinical indicators. High-risk patients may also benefit, for example: patients with existing comorbidities that may be associated with hypersecretion or ineffective cough (eg, neuromuscular disease, respiratory disease and cystic fibrosis). Physiotherapists who practise in the ICU environment may also provide airway clearance techniques for ventilated patients Box 1. Physiotherapy workforce planning and preparation recommendations. It is recommended that staff who are pregnant avoid exposure to COVID-19. It is known that pregnant women are potentially at increased risk of complications from any respiratory disease due to the physiological changes that occur in pregnancy. There is not enough currently available information on the impact of COVID-19 on a pregnant woman or her baby.",

The recommendations are intended for use in adults only. This document has been constructed using existing medical guidelines, relevant literature and expert opinion.

Further iterations of these recommendations will be published as new information arises. The information provided in this document is not designed to replace local institutional policies and should not replace clinical reasoning for individual patient management. The authors are not liable for the accuracy, information that may be perceived as misleading, or completeness of information in this document. The author group will review and update this guidance within 6 months, or if important new evidence emerges that changes the recommendations herein. b These recommendations have been endorsed by: Australian Physiotherapy Association, Canadian Physiotherapy Association, Association of Chartered Society of Physiotherapists in Respiratory Care UK, Associazione Riabilitatori dell' Insufficienza Respiratoria, Koninklijk Nederlands Genootschap voor Fysiotherapie, International Confederation of Cardiorespiratory Physical Therapists, World Confederation for Physical Therapy, AXXON Physical Therapy in Belgium, and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Kin\u00e9sith\u00e9rapie de R\u00e9animation. eAddenda: Appendices 1 and 2 can be found online at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.jphys.2020.03.011.",

In addition, if possible, physiotherapists should position themselves 2 m from the patient and out of the likely path of dispersion. physiotherapy interventions are potentially aerosol-generating procedures. While there are insufficient investigations confirming the aerosol-generating potential of various physiotherapy interventions,25 the combination with cough for airway clearance makes all techniques potentially aerosol-generating procedures.These include: cough-generating procedures (eg, cough or huff during treatment) positioning or gravity-assisted drainage techniques and manual techniques (eg, expiratory vibrations, percussion and manually assisted cough) that may trigger a cough and sputum expectoration use of positive pressure breathing devices (eg, inspiratory positive pressure breathing), mechanical insufflation-exsufflation devices, intra/extra pulmonary high-frequency oscillation devices (eg, The Vest, MetaNeb, Percussionaire) PEP and oscillating PEP devices bubble PEP nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal suctioning manual hyperinflation open suction saline instillation via an open-circuit endotracheal tube inspiratory muscle training, particularly if used with patients who are ventilated and disconnection from a breathing circuit is required sputum inductions any mobilisation or therapy that may result in coughing and expectoration of mucus Therefore, there is a risk of creating an airborne transmission of COVID-19 during treatments.
