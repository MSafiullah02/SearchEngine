            "text": "The developmental objectives of composite filtering media are lower energy consumption, longer filter life, high filtration capacity, greater dust holding (in depth filtration) and easy cleanability (of surface filter), satisfying more than one functional requirement and easier maintenance. Composite structures are usually multilayered filter media, each layer serving a specific purpose in the filtration/separation process. All the layers of a composite are not necessarily nonwovens. One or more of the layers could be a membrane material, a woven material, or a plastic or metal mesh material to provide structural support. Further, there are two contrasting styles of laminated structure, depending on whether the filter medium is intended to function by depth filtration or by surface filtration. With depth filtration, the medium should be graded so as to increase the fineness of fibers in the direction of flow. The upper, coarser layers will act as a prefilter, in which the larger particles are retained, with the smaller particles then being trapped subsequently in the finer layers. This will maximize the dirt holding capacity per unit area of medium, and hence its life before it is discarded. In the case of surface filtration, material consisting of finer pores/larger surface area should be at the upstream side, so that it can be cleaned intermittently for regeneration purpose.",

Very fine fibers can be made from meltblown, bi-component and electro-spinning techniques. Nanofiber fabric possess extremely high surface to weight ratio from small fiber diameters (10\u2013100 times smaller than those of meltblown and spunbond filaments), interconnected pore structure, very small pore size and potential for functional modification of the fiber surface, thus offering more possibilities for a wide range of applications, ranging from air cleaning for automotive to environment conditioning or liquid filtration (Yoon et al., 2006; Barhate and Ramakrishna, 2007; Dotti et al., 2007). In all these applications, finer fiber materials need to be supported by a stronger component in composite. There is another perspective of the use of thin layers of finer fibers. The media made out of finer fiber lead to higher filtration efficiency at the cost of higher pressure differential across the fabric. For a suitable balance between efficiency and levels of pressure, use of a thin layer of finer fiber component in a composite is required.",

            "text": "The finer fiber layer can be positioned upstream before the macro filtration substrate to enhance surface filtration performance or downstream of the macro filtration substrate to improve depth filtration in order to capture particles within the body of the media. Finer media at the upstream side of surface filters lead to better cake dislodgement and prevention of particle penetration inside filter media (Kothari et al., 1993; Ciach and Gradon, 1998; Call\u00e9 et al., 2002), which in turn results in better long term performance of filter media. However, a thin layer of nanofibers on meltblown media has a weak bond and higher production costs (Lydall Filtration and Separation, 2013). The weak bond is a problem in the nanofiber layer in self-cleaning or pulse cleaning filter applications. The dust cake formed on the upstream side of the filter media can be removed by back-pulsing air through the media to rejuvenate it. As a great force is exerted on the surface during the back-pulse, nanofibers with poor adhesion to substrates, or comprised of delicate nanofibers, can delaminate when the shock wave moves from the interior of the filter through the substrate to the nanofiber. However, the new nanofiber technology was reported to provide excellent adhesion to the substrate, enabling longer life and improved efficiencies in pulse-cleaning applications because of greater particle collection and overall energy expended during the cleaning process. The plurality of nanofiber layers also provides superior durability (Wertz and Schneiders, 2009).",

Researchers have also developed an industrial gas filter medium consisting of 70% polymers with a regular melting temperature and 30% polymers with a low melting temperature. This medium employs polyester felts as the base material for the polymer mix, with a prepared polyamide nano-sized web at the upstream side of the fabric (Yeo et al., 2007). A thermal roller was employed to bond the overlapped filter medium. Subsequent work to evaluate filtration capability revealed greater collection efficiency and more stable filtration behavior in the medium with the nano-sized web showing more stable filtration behavior and improved collection efficiency. The levels of dust found to be left in fabric containing nanofiber web was also revealed to be far lower than those in fabric with no nanofiber web (Yeo et al., 2007). One patent disclosure suggested that high filtration efficiency could be achieved by enhancing the upstream surface of a spunbonded medium via use of a micro- or nanofiber structure on the upstream surface (Chung et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Most often the combination of structure is made by heat bonding the process either by purely heating the process or by using hot melt adhesive. Combination is also possible by ultrasonic welding. Hydro-entanglement and needlepunching are also interesting options for the joining together of two layers to produce composite filtration materials. In one study, the needlepunching technique was used as the initial step in preparing P84 needlefelt. P84 needlefelt was then prepared by taking the upstream side of felt, constructed of standard 2.2 dtexfiber, and adding 1.0 dtexmicrofiber. This produces a medium capable of increasing gas filtration efficiency by preventing deep dust penetration, maintaining stable pressure drop, and facilitating good bag life. As well as being an effective filtration medium in gas filtration systems, P84 fibers can additionally be used as either a PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) fiber blending partner, or in the construction of surface layers on homopolymer acrylic, polyester or m-aramide felts (Connor, 1997). Varied combinations of medium have been tested in layered construction, leading to the formation of such composites as a felt-like layered construction of PTFE and glass paper (Fagan, 1982).",

Problems of structural damage and delamination in depth filtration applications can be largely overcome by suitable composite development. In the combination of meltblown (M) and spunlaid (S) nonwovens (SMS, SMMS or SSMMS), the spunlaid component provides the required strength and abrasion properties and the meltblown component act as a barrier for liquids or particles. For the aforesaid reason, a major portion of meltblown material is used in composite form (Hutten, 2007). Figure 8.3\nshows the cross-sectional view of an SMS fabric.",

It was observed that an electrospun membrane conveniently rejected the microparticles and acted as a screen filter without fouling the membrane especially when the particles were larger than the largest pore size of the nanofibrous membrane (Gopal e t al., 2007). Nanofibrous filtering media can be used where high-performance air purification is needed such as in hospitals, healthcare facilities, research labs, electronic component manufacturers, military and government agencies, food, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The medium is very efficient for filtration of blood, water, air, beverages, gases, chemicals, oils, diesel and petrol, etc. Manufacturing and processing companies in food, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and the semiconductor business require centralized air conditioning in the production environment, high purity water, clean gases and effluent/waste air and water treatment. Control over airborne and waterborne contaminants, hazardous biological agents, allergens and pollutants is a key issue in food, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology processes. Under these circumstances, nanofiber-based filtering media are very useful (Barhatea and Ramakrishna, 2007). Nanofibers offer enhanced filtration performance in both mobile and stationary engines and industrial filtration applications wherein the nanofiber layer is used at the upstream side of the filter media.",

In a medial application, water resistant but water permeable coating of chitosan (antimicrobial) was applied over the polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous layer which was supported on the nonwoven microfibrous substrate (meltblown polyethylene terephthalate mat). This three-tier approach is useful for flux and low fouling ultra filtration (Yoon et al., 2006). High surface-to-volume ratio of nanofibrous media enhances the fouling.

In scrim fabrics, if the nonwoven layer shrinks it does not cause any change in the dimension of filter bags, meaning there is no deterioration of filter ability, and some research suggests that the bags remain operational at temperatures of up to 300 \u00b0C. By assessing retention of fabric strength, the service life of both P84/basalt filters composite (meteor bags) and membrane laminated glass fiber bags have been estimated and found to be comparable.

Membrane fouling leads to higher operation and maintenance costs by deteriorating membrane performances (flux decline vs. time, zeta potential changing during time, etc.) and eventually shortening membrane life. Hence it is sensible to use nonwoven porous support which generally has the superior dirt-holding capacity and does not have a much wider pore size distribution. Such quality, along with reinforcement of mechanical strength to the membranes, gives better performance with decreased fouling. In a research work (Hegde et al., 2011) on a polysulfone blend nanoporous membrane with nonwoven support consisting of fine polyester fibers, it was observed that nonwoven support minimizes membrane fouling apart from providing mechanical strength to the membrane during the filtration process. Hence it helps in better membrane performance in terms of salt rejection, improved flux, thermal stability and proton conductivity. The membrane is essentially a surface filtration device, with little or no depth filtration involved in its use. In practice, many membranes are of asymmetric structure and effectively comprise two layers. The active, surface layer is a very thin skin, the permeability of which is of critical importance. The lower, thicker layer is of more open structure, its role being to serve as a mechanical support for the active layer. One of the most popular membranes is PTFE. The advantages of the PTFE (naturally hydrophobic) membrane are its superior chemical and temperature resistance and its non-sticky nature. Apart from PTFE, another most widely used acrylic copolymer membrane is inherently hydrophilic, and offers low extractability. The laminated product with nonwoven polyester fabric is employed in semiconductor water, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages.",

The composite with ePTFE and UPE membranes provide high efficiency at these higher airspeeds and the low pressure drop enables the high airflow rates with reduced power consumption. The low pressure drop, ULPA efficiency and hydrophobic membrane properties are essential in surgical and hospital airway management, protecting both the patient and equipment. Those same properties are ideal for venting applications such as ostomy bags. The membrane can also be typically laminated to a carbon impregnated nonwoven. The combined filter provides for pressure relief, an absolute barrier to liquid flow through the filter in both directions and odor reduction. Depending upon the particular requirements, the membrane may be treated to enhance its oleophobic properties. In biopharmaceutical manufacturing, ePTFE and UPE filters can be used to vent gases produced during fermentation and cell culture. These vent filters require an absolute barrier to microorganisms in aerosols and to bacteria in the event the filter is wet out. The gamma stable properties of UPE membranes provide significant benefit in single-use applications in the medical and biopharmaceutical fields (Galka and Saxena, 2009).",

            "text": "In industrial gas filtration, higher efficiency is provided by filter membranes than by conventional fabrics. An expanded PTFE membrane is shown in Fig. 8.7\n. The size of the pores trap any particles below 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter whilst still allowing air to pass through, thereby proving more effective for filtering, particularly for small particles, than conventional filters (Fig. 8.8\n). This membrane is attached to needlepunched felts, spunbonded or over spunlace nonwovens. Different fiber polymers, including homopolymer acrylic, torcon, nomex, static conducting polyester, polyester and polypropylene, can be used to make the substrate, as can woven fabric of PTFE yarn/glass yarn. The chemically inert PTFE membrane can withstand high temperatures of up to 260 \u00b0C. When selecting the base material, the filtration operating temperature and chemical environment must be taken into account. High efficiency and exceptional flow capability are provided by uniquely engineered microstructures in the PTFE membranes (Martin, 1999; Griffin, 2003; Menardi Filters, 2013; Mueller sales, 2013; Simatek A/S, 2013; W. L. Gore & Associates, 2013a). In comparison to the plain spunbonded media, a slightly higher filtration efficiency of 99.999% (99.9975% efficiency without lamination) was given by lamination of a PTFE membrane to the spunbonded polyester media. This result was obtained while operating at a slightly higher pressure drop. Such spunbonded media have been employed in bag houses, ventilating many applications (Martin, 1999).",

The cake must be removed by cleaning processes, once the pressure drop is considered relatively high, in order to minimize resistance to gas flow and, consequently, reduce costs. Therefore, improvements in the cake removal process may represent substantial economic gains, as well as significant contributions to a greater improvement of the filtration process.",

In addition to improving filtration efficiency and cake release, this process improves the efficiency of heat, chemical and abrasion resistance (Goosens, 1993). When applied to the needlefelt surface, coatings form a quasi-membrane structure. The addition of a Teflon B coating on the surface of glass fiber fabric for boiler applications is common (Carr and Smith, 1984). During the late 1980s Ravensworth Ltd developed a range of coated materials, under the trade name of Ravlex, for achieving superior filtration performance. Three main product groups are generally used for the coating process: Ravlex MX, Ravlex PPC and Ravlex YP. Ravlex MX is a PTFE microporous embedded coating which is applied to the carrier needlefelt filtration surface. Ravlex MX is generally used for the filtration of fine particles in the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. Formulated from PTFE, the Ravlex PPC coating offers higher permeability than the Ravlex MX due to its larger pore size, thereby making it suitable for the filtering agglomerating or sticky dusts. With a pore structure similar to Ravlex PPC, Ravlex YP is formulated from polyurethane (PU), whilst another recent product, Ravlex CR, is formulated from PTFE coating. As previously outlined, all such coatings usually offer such benefits as high abrasion resistance, effective cake release, increased air permeability, reduced operational pressure drop (resistance to blinding), reduced cleaning frequency and extended filter operational life (Gibbons, 2002, Lydon, 2004; Ravensworth Ltd., UK, 2004a, Ravensworth Ltd., UK, 2004b).",

The specific density of the foam when applied to the material is also essential for successful application. If the density is too high, the substrate is wetted excessively. This leads to inadequate penetration and poor mechanical bonding as a result of the unacceptable air permeability and too low a density, increasing the risk of delamination.",

Innovative plasma processes allow depositing coatings with high levels of hydrophobicity and/or oleophobicity for use in gas filtration, or coatings with permanent hydrophilic effect for liquid filter media and battery separators. The use of low pressure plasma for surface modification of filter media becomes more widespread because it is a dry and clean technology. The coatings applied by low pressure plasma polymerization also give good resistance to abrasion and washing. At the same time, it helps these companies to save costs because of a lower consumption of energy and chemicals (Legein, 2011). A well-known application of plasma coating is found in the production of blood filter media, respiratory mask, filter for HVAC, etc.",

As the meltblown layer conducts the final filtration, the spunbonded layer acts as a prefilter. In the gradient density medium, the differing bulk of each layer provides an increasingly efficient level of filtration; as the fluid moves through these increasingly fine layers, smaller and smaller contaminant particles are removed. Better filtration has been found through producing a unique gradient structure made in two steps. In the first step, a pile stitch-bonded nonwoven with a one loop surface is manufactured. In the second step, the one loop surface of pile stitch-bonded nonwoven is compressed by putting a hydroentangled nonwoven on it (Smithies and Zimmerman, 2005; Lin et al., 2006). The result is a gradient density medium and a photomicrograph of the structure is shown in Fig. 8.10\n. The product is unique in that the fibers of the upper pile surface are oriented in the direction of flow. This is in contrast to the conventional filter media where the fibers are generally perpendicular to the direction of flow. The share in pile ranges from 98% to 99% and the number and size of cavities between the fibers depend on the fineness of fibers used and the fabric thickness.

Due to the gradient pore size, these media have a high dust-holding capacity and low pressure drop. The multilayer construction can combine mechanical filtration (a prefilter that removes most particles), electrostatic filtration (the middle layer allows high initial filtration efficiency) and the last layer/filter that allows high efficiency for all filter life. The triple-layer construction makes it possible to create different kinds of products by simply modifying the grammage or the fiber composition of the layers. The composite can be pleatable on different kinds of pleating machines. It is also possible to mix different fibers (a wide range of natural, mineral, synthetic and man-made fibers of varying length) and obtain a wide range of fiber orientation ranging from random to parallel with the consequent differences in filtration performances and applications. The system is flexible to incorporate gas adsorption media (for example activated carbon granules) on-line in the middle layer, obtaining an efficient filter for gas odor removal. This innovative concept of wet lay technology can create nonwovens with special properties, i.e. high efficiency filter media (or gas-adsorption filter media) combined with a very low pressure drop. These advantages make these nonwovens extremely useful for applications such as cabin air or HVAC where high permeability assures a consistent air-flow into the filtration system (Ahlstrom Technical Specialties, 2001; Montefusco, 2005). It may be noted that there are other ways of creating a gradient structure, for example the Intrepid\u2122 filter medium by Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc.

One feature common to all multifunctional reactors is their facilitation for the substitution of a single process unit in place of at least two, allowing all necessary operations to be carried out simultaneously. The catalytic reactions occurring in catalytic filters have been found to be useful in one such application, as they are able to remove particulates from flue gases (from, for example, waste incinerators, diesel engines, boilers, pressurized fluidized bed coal combustors, or biomass gasifiers, amongst others) whilst also abating chemical pollutants (including nitrogen oxides, dioxins, volatile organic compounds, tar and carbonaceous material). A thin layer of the catalyst is applied directly onto the filter material, which may either be rigid (consisting of filter tubes made of sintered granules) or flexible (nonwoven fabrics) (Matatov-Meytal and Sheintuch, 2002; Fino et al., 2004).

The nonwoven layers perform particulate filtration and the activated carbon layer separates molecular contaminants by adsorption. With average surface areas of around 1000 m2/g, the activated carbon surface is very irregular, with pore sizes ranging from 0.5 to 50 nm. This feature allows the surface to absorb substances with widely varying particle sizes. In addition, water vapor is not favorably adsorbed by activated carbon, as activated carbon is nonpolar. Due to this the surface can capture organic vapors at relatively high humidity. In addition, carbons with smaller pore sizes facilitate the increased capture of high-volatility vapors, due to having a greater affinity for them.",

These nonwovens do not contain any additional agent to bind sorbent particles, hence the durability of binding sorbent particles is the key issue in this technology. Organoleptic assessment is useful to determine the durability of active carbon particle bonds in the composite nonwovens.

The filter (Austin air filter) is composed of a prefilter (to trap larger particles such as dirt, lint and hair), a layer with a carbon and zeolite mix (to adsorb odors and gases), and HEPA filter paper (to remove harmful airborne particles).",

The conventional adsorption product is coconut shell carbon, but this can be boosted with chemical impregnation for higher efficiency in critical gas applications. It is possible to use commercial carbon fiber of 5\u201310 \u03bcm diameter which offers a possible alternative to organic fibers and glass fibers for filter pads and felts for extreme chemical and temperature use and to dissipate electrical charges, with additional advantage that the material can be activated as an adsorbent filter. The main limitation of carbon fiber as a filter medium has been its expense, coupled with the fact that the current fiber diameter sizes are higher resulting in reduced performance of current HEPA filters using microglassfibers. However, carbon fibers down to nanometer diameters are now becoming commercially available and these are going to be an exceedingly important component of the fiber filter media business.",

In a report, a silver nanoparticles-chitosan composite was prepared by using a microcrystalline chitosan gelatinous water dispersion at ambient temperature and its aqueous solution was applied to the antibacterial finishing of Tencel/cotton nonwoven fabric. The finished nonwoven fabric showed excellent water absorption ability, air permeability and antibacterial activity against E.coli (Di et al., 2012).

For cleanroom application, retention of static charge is beneficial; whereas in an industrial environment (e.g., the sugar industry) dissipation of static charge is most often required. Several nonwovens are available with a conductive surface to fulfill the requirements of static dissipation arising from explosive hazardous applications (Sievert, 2011). The high resistivity exhibited by the majority of synthetic fibers makes them a potential source for static build up, which can lead to arcing and explosions. In order to reduce such risks, a range of methods have been employed to increase the conductivity of filter media and facilitate the movement of any static build up directly to the ground. Such methods, which have varying degrees of durability, cost, efficiency, practicality and contamination potential, include the use of epitropic and stainless steel fiber admixtures, chemical coatings, aluminized coatings, carbon/resin coatings and carbon lines printed on a media. At the time of writing there is a clear market potential for the development of an efficient, durable, convenient conductive fiber which can be successfully applied to a wide range of filtration applications (Scoble, 2011). Mesh materials are frequently used in sandwich formations, primarily for static dissipation and also for structural support.

In all these improvements, development of the composite filter media is of prime importance. Usually, ultra- fine filters such as HEPA and ULPA elements use a sheet form of medium produced with glass microfibers with a graduated matrix to provide very high dust retention capacities. Nonwoven media, made from progressively structured thermally- (meltblown and spunbonded) and resin-bonded synthetic fibers, are gaining in use over glass fiber media. PP melt blown supported by spunbonded material are also used as HEPA filters. HEPA filter performance is found to be improved through appropriately structured meltblown nonwovens (Hassan et al.. 2012). There are many other variants of filter media composite structure such as the SMS (spunbond/meltblown/spunbond) process and variations thereof. The layered construction enables a gradual removal of finer airborne particles. In addition to being less expensive, filters exhibit greater durability, performance, safety, and environmental friendliness than their nonwoven glass fiber counterparts (Thiele and Badt, 1996). In addition, some designs offer varied separation modes within a single filter media. In automotive cabin air filters, for example, a nonwoven particulate filter layer is often combined with an activated carbon layer, offering further removal of odors and fumes.",

The high pressure common rail fuel injection system (HPCR) requires fuel cleanliness levels far more demanding than past fuel systems or even high pressure hydraulic systems. Compared to existing fuel filters, the advanced fuel filter exhibits better water and particle removal. This results in reduced wear of HPCR components and reduced engine downtime (Wieczorek et al., 2012).\u2022In a study by Doh and co-workers, poly-vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was fabricated using electro-spinning technology onto Kapok nonwoven and tuned into composite filtration/separation media. PVDF polymers possess excellent mechanical properties and resistance to severe environmental stress, good chemical resistance, good piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties.

Because of the unique manufacturing process of the bicomponent nonwoven, it is possible to tune its properties in such a way that the nonwoven gets optimal properties for specific filtration applications (Maltha et al., 2012). Recently, more and more nanofiber/bicomponent/meltblown media are combined for particle filtration, whether purely mechanical or electrostatically charged or a combination thereof, with the benefits of activated carbon. These combined filters not only stop particles but also absorb a multitude of gasses and odors. New developments in the manufacturing of nonwoven media containing activated carbon, which tightly encapsulates the carbon particles, now allow manufacturers to easily pleat these media and hence design filters for a wide variety of shapes and sizes. By means of activated carbon applied over flat and even layers on various textiles (Diederich, 2011) odors and VOCs in the automotive interior can be controlled. Different activated carbons can be used according to what substances and how much gas and odor filtration are required to be adsorbed. As typical cabin air filters cannot catch emissions in the car interior, especially when the car is stationary, car interiors can be made out of the composite containing activated carbon. The increasing public awareness of air quality is expected to move cabin air filters into more and more cars, therefore further expanding this market (Barrillon, 2005).",

The contaminants include particulate matter, moisture, and microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. Apart from the particulate filter, a separate coalescing filter medium can be used for removal of moisture from fuel. The typical coalescing media for the filter inlet element is usually a resin-treated wet- laid medium composed of a blend of cellulose fibers and glass microfibers. Sometimes synthetic fiber such as polyester is added for greater flex resistance. In filters, a fairly hydrophilic fiber surface is desired that attracts water droplets and holds on to them as they grow in size by being struck by additional droplets. Media treated with phenolic resin generally have the right surface properties for good coalescing and separation efficiencies. Eventually, the coalesced water particles will be of sufficient size to be blown off the fibers by the fluid stream passing through the medium. Downstream of the medium, the water droplets are of sufficient size to settle gravimetrically in the settling sump. It is key that the exit element or separator is extremely hydrophobic, rejecting any small water particles entrained in the fuel stream. The addition of very low energy media (such as a fluorocarbon or silicone) as a coating for the exit elements can enhance this.",
