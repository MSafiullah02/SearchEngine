A paired comparison of throat and nasopharyngeal swabs in Kenya demonstrated that among SARI patients, throat swabs were less likely than nasopharyngeal swabs to yield influenza B virus, PIV\u20102 and PIV\u20103 but more likely to yield adenovirus and influenza A virus.24 The Kenya study found no difference in yield of PIV\u20101, MPV, and RSV by swab type.
