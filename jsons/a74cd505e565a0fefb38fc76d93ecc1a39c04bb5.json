The administrative and organizational reforms have not been without its setbacks or obstacles; however, they were not so insurmountable that they could not be overcome by one of Korea's greatest assets: persisting endeavors to build back better and to enhance resilience. Starting with an independent national agency in 2004 to manage natural and human-caused disasters and preparedness, the government quickly realized, through focusing events, it was insufficient to handle the increasing complexity and intensifying of disasters striking the nation. Therefore, through political will and hindsight, it continuously coalesced pertinent disaster management responsibilities into newer and newer agencies until 2016, when it enacted a progressively more ubiquitous and self-propelling agency. However, although the agency is apt for current disasters, it will not be for future disaster, which needs the integration of resilience into Disaster Risk Management (DRM). Therefore, we suggest five tenets on how to make Korea's resilient future as well as for other nations that are and will follow in Korea's footsteps, especially for those nations in Asia and Africa. A future that is resilient against all types of disaster risks, especially being prepared well for \"low probability and high impact\" focusing events that are located in the long-tail of the Power-law Distribution.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "As MoSPA revealed the limits in disaster response, such as the insufficient coordination among relevant ministries and agencies, the necessity to improve the National Disaster Corresponding System arose.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "During the speech related to the Sewol Ferry sinking accident on May 19, 2014, President Park Geun-hye promised the innovation of the national disaster and safety management system: the integration of the disaster and safety functions dispersed throughout the ministries and the establishment of an independent agency to manage and coordinate all types of national disasters. The government then reflected the President's statement on the restructuring of the system and submitted the revision of the Government Organization Act on June 11, 2014, to the National Assembly. This Act was approved at the General Assembly Meeting on November 7 and implemented on November 19, installing the Ministry of Public Safety and Security (MPSS) as a responsible ministry of national disaster and safety management under the Office of Prime Minister (OPM). MPSS's integrated tasks are safety management and social disaster management in the MoSPA; natural disaster management and firefighting in NEMA; and maritime security and prevention of coastal and marine pollution (except for the works on investigations and information of incidents at sea) in Korea Coast Guard.

The establishment of NEMA in 2004 was meaningful as the first independent agency to deal with natural disaster management, human-caused disaster management, civil defense, firefighting, and emergency rescue on land. However, as a vice-minister level, it had limited power and authorities to coordinate and control all line ministries. As an ad hoc solution, the Minister of the Ministry of Interior (MoI) took charge of directing the CDSCHQ, and the director of the NEMA took charge as deputy head, which made it hard for NEMA to coordinate and control disaster countermeasures among the line ministries, using its own discretion. In addition, with a revision of the Disasters and Safety Act in 2013, MoSPA took the responsibility of humancaused disaster management from NEMA, and after then, NEMA took charge of only natural disaster management and fire services, which made integrated disaster management weak. Therefore, the foundation of MPSS has implications in developing an integrated disaster and safety management system to deal with all types of disasters, which could solve problems rooted in 2013 and 2014.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Implications of the Establishment of MPSS"}, {"text": "The new ministry of MPSS also made it possible to strengthen incident control towers and to enhance an integrated disaster response. In other words, the balance of the national disaster and safety management system could be maintained by establishing a ministry which could manage and coordinate the disaster and safety management policies, which were meted out to each ministry. MPSS developed the Safety Innovation Master Plan (SIMP), which includes all the areas relevant to public safety, by reexamining the overall disaster safety management system in order to prepare the fundamental safety innovation plan. The SIMP, which contains every ministry plan, prepared the standardized framework of disaster safety management and put the realization of safety autonomy forward by supporting safety management by local governments comprehensively. Also, they strengthened safety welfare regarding disaster vulnerable groups like children and women and focused on the settlement of autonomous safety management through national participation. ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Implications of the Establishment of MPSS"}, {"text": "After its establishment, MPSS set up the vision of \"A Safe Country, Happy People,\" and three targets of \"Practicing safety in their daily lives,\" \"Embodying a culture of safety,\" and \"Policies prioritizing safety\". It also developed a \"Safety Innovation Master Plan,\" proposing the strategic direction for the improvement of the Korean disaster and safety management system. The SIMP was established to embrace the demand of the public whose interest of disaster raised after the Sewol Ferry sinking accident. This was done through various ways and successive participation of the private sector like running an advisory panel of civilian experts, collecting ideas from the general public, having meetings with civil society organizations, and having panel discussions with the general public.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Main Policies of MPSS"}, {"text": "The following five strategies for disaster and safety policy development were suggested by the SIMP:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Main Policies of MPSS"}, {"text": "\u2022 Reinforcement of safety management control function; \u2022 Reinforcement of on-site disaster response; \u2022 Spread of safety culture in everyday life; \u2022 Expansion of disaster safety infrastructure; and \u2022 Creative safety management by each sector", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Main Policies of MPSS"}, {"text": "In accordance with the Master Plan, MPSS has been improving the national disaster and safety management system with the following policies:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Main Policies of MPSS"}, {"text": "First, MPSS constructed an integrated disaster management system to reinforce the control function and clarified roles and responsibilities of each Headquarters: CDSCHQ, CDMHQ, Local Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters (LDSCHQ), and Local Disaster Management Headquarters (LDMHQ). It also innovated a disaster response system: i.e., disaster response manuals were enhanced from complicated and paper-centered into simplified and actionoriented. Second, MPSS has reinforced on-site response capabilities in order to secure the golden time, 30 min on land and 1 h at sea, and strengthened the disaster management capabilities of the local government, which is the priority at the disaster scene. To secure the golden time, MPSS divided the land into four areas with independent 119 Special Rescue Teams in each area and divided the sea into five areas, covered by three Special Marine Rescue Teams, along with a prompt call out system. For strengthening the disaster management capabilities of local governments, MPSS supported local governments to strengthen their official's disaster management capabilities through providing education and training opportunities and to set up an exclusively professional disaster and safety management office. It also developed the Local Safety Index to induce local governments to check safety levels by themselves objectively, and to implement improvement measures for the disaster vulnerable parts autonomously. Moreover, MPSS enhanced disaster preparedness training by putting stress on the organizational capacity for on-site response. Accordingly, the 2016 Safe Korea Exercise was designed for strengthening the interconnectivity and cooperation among the CDSCHQ, the CDMHQ, and the LDMHQ to prepare for large-scale disasters and catastrophic events. Also, emergency rescue capabilities of the first responders were also tested and improved through drills. Third, strengthening public safety education, establishing public-private cooperation governance involving communities, and strengthening safety welfare for disaster vulnerable groups have been implemented in order to settle down the safety culture in daily life. To build up the capability to prepare for disaster autonomously, lifetime safety education is implemented as to provide safety education, which is tailored to their age and environment. To establish local governance, a website and a mobile application, coined \"Safe People,\" were developed and are being operated to involve residents in pre-examining the accident factors, and good examples from \"Safe People\" are promoted online and offline. For citizen's proactive participation in \"Safe People,\" MPSS run On-site Safety Report Joint Campaigns where they visit the education organizations and event sites, and support the promotion of National Safety Inspection. Also, they are expanding supporting projects for disaster vulnerable groups like the disabled, senior citizens, and children. In particular, they put efforts to make a safe environment for children at the level of developed countries. Fourth, MPSS has developed a prompt situation management and dissemination system, with a real-time link of disaster sites with national disaster situation rooms. To this end, MPSS established a real-time on-site monitoring system by installing a GIS-based disaster situation board, and strengthened the management of disaster vulnerable areas. In addition, MPSS developed a long-term plan to establish a disaster safety communication network to reinforce first response capabilities, an integrated response system, and an on-site commanding system. In 2016, the pilot projects started in three areas (Pyeongchang-gun, Gangneungsi, and Jeongseon-gun) in Gangwon-do, and the system will be installed nationwide within a few years. Fifth, MPSS is promoting creative disaster and safety management policies in each ministry in order to develop appropriate countermeasures against special disasters, such as aviation influenza, marine accident, energy infrastructure accidents, hazardous materials, communications infrastructure failure, and nuclear power plant accidents, which need a different approach from traditional disaster management method. It also prepares for newly emerging risks like climate change (CC), aging, and globalization. Therefore, they put efforts on improving safety policies by identifying social issues and the needs of the public based on big data, by providing pre-emptive public service, and by establishing on-site disaster and accident symptom monitoring systems by utilizing intelligent Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) and Internet of Things (IoT). Also, they are enhancing the resident securing system to correspond to various security threats, managing nuclear safety, and strengthening the food and drug safety net with relevant ministries.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Main Policies of MPSS"}, {"text": "Three important global agreements were achieved in 2015 in the fields of disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate change, and sustainable development, while Korea was enhancing its DRM system through active citizenry participation, since the establishment of MPSS in November 2014.

Priority 1 is understanding disaster risk. DRM should be based on an understanding of disaster risk in all its dimensions of vulnerability, capacity, exposure of persons and assets, hazard characteristics, and the environment. Priority 2 is strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk. Disaster risk governance at the national, regional, and global levels is very important, and this should be ensuring the consistency with domestic laws, regulations and policies of national and local framework. Priority 3 is investing in DRR for resilience. Public and private investment in disaster risk prevention and reduction through structural and non-structural measures are essential to enhance the economic, social, health, and cultural resilience of persons, communities, countries, and their assets, as well as the environment. Priority 4 is enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to \"Build Back Better\" in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction. Having experience is to strengthen disaster preparedness and to have effective recovery. In their approach to DRR, States, regional, and international organizations and other relevant stakeholders should take into consideration the key activities listed under each of these four priorities and should implement them, as appropriate, taking into consideration respective capacities and capabilities, in line with national laws and regulations. In the context of increasing global interdependence and concerted international cooperation, developing the knowledge sharing, capacities and motivation for DRR are needed. The SFDRR is guided by following 13 principles 1. Primary responsibility of States to prevent and reduce disaster risk, including through cooperation. 2. Shared responsibility between central government and national authorities, sectors and stakeholders as appropriate to national circumstances. 3. Protection of persons and their assets while promoting and protecting all human rights including the right to development. 4. Engagement from all of society. 5.

Empowerment of local authorities and communities through resources, incentives, and decision-making responsibilities as appropriate. 7. Decision-making to be inclusive and risk-informed while using a multi-hazard approach. 8. Coherence of disaster risk reduction and sustainable development policies, plans, practices, and mechanisms, across different sectors. 9. Accounting of local and specific characteristics of disaster risks when determining measures to reduce risk. 10. Addressing underlying risk factors cost-effectively through investment versus relying primarily on post-disaster response and recovery. 11. \"Build Back Better\" for preventing the creation of, and reducing existing, disaster risk. 12.

The term \"Resilience\" has been used in various fields. For example, in physics, resilience is described as \"the ability to return to one's former shape after being deformed\" (Gerbode 2009). In psychology, resilience is defined as \"flexibility in response to changing situational demands, and the ability to bounce back from negative emotional experiences\" (Block and Block 1980; Block and Kremen 1996; Lazarus 1993) . In ecology, resilience has been defined in two different ways. The first definition is \"the time required for a system to return to an equilibrium or steady-state following a perturbation,\" and the second definition is \"the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed before the system redefines its structure by changing the variables and processes that control behavior\" (Gunderson 2000) . In the field of business, resilience is defined as \"the ability to rapidly adapt and respond to business disruptions and to maintain continuous business operations, be a more trusted partner, and enable growth.\" (IBM 2009 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 831, "end": 853, "text": "(Block and Block 1980;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 854, "end": 876, "text": "Block and Kremen 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 877, "end": 890, "text": "Lazarus 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1284, "text": "(Gunderson 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1508, "text": "(IBM 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Significance of the Global Agenda for Resilience"}, {"text": "In the field of DRR, resilience can be defined as \"the ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions.\" (UNISDR 2009) In other words, disaster resilience means the ability to \"resile from\" or \"spring back from\" a shock. The resilience of a community in respect to potential hazard events is determined by the degree to which the community has the necessary resources and is capable of organizing itself both prior to and during times of need.

Those extreme events having intensive risk are mostly located in the long-tail of the Power-law Distribution. While most public policy concerning social issues, such as welfare and education, is developed by focusing on average events because those average events reflect most of the needs, dealing with disaster requires a different approach from most social areas: extreme events, sometimes being considered outliers, is more important than average events because those events affect the society severely. These events, which used to be considered as extreme phenomena due to their \"low frequency,\" can no longer be ignored as they have become less extreme and more reoccurring. Perrow's Normal Accident Theory, Beck's Risk Society Theory, and the Power-law Distribution of Complexity Theory show that massive catastrophes can happen at any time. Through the analysis of disasters that have led to a change in disaster response policy, we were able to find that most of them, which can be labeled as \"focusing event,\" have a common characteristic of \"low frequency and high impact.\" The events, such as the Seongsu Bridge collapse in 1994, the Sampoong Department Store collapse in 1995, Typhoon Rusa in 2002, the Daegu Subway Fire in 2003, the Sewol Ferry sinking accident in 2014, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2015, are typical examples of focusing events that are located in the long-tail of the Power-law Distribution and that have \"low frequency and high social impact.\" Therefore, a future disaster response system should be developed to thoroughly prepare for the disasters that are located in or have possibilities of being located in the long-tail of Power-law Distribution, based on the condition that such disasters can occur at any time. To this end, on the first hand, those responsible for safety at high-risk facilities should reduce the probability of disaster by thoroughly performing safety checks and diagnostics. The next step is to strengthen the initial response capacity so that even though an accident occurs, it does not evolve a national emergency. Rapid identification of risky situations, prompt reporting, and appropriate action by first responding agencies are essential capacities for this purpose. Finally, it is necessary to develop a \"national catastrophic scenario\" in preparation for a national emergency that can occur with very little probability, and to establish a system in which all related stakeholders form a collaborative network for an efficient response.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Intensive Risk Aligned with the Power-Law Distribution"}, {"text": "The future DRM system should aim to be an integrated system on the basis of the principle of comprehensiveness: dealing with all types of disaster risk; facilitating a unity of efforts of all stakeholders, such as central governments, local governments, and civil groups; and covering the entire cycle of disaster management processes. 2 Regarding the all-hazards approach, organizations in developed countries, such as Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the United States (USA), and Civil Contingencies Act (CCA) in the United Kingdom (UK), aim to develop an Integrated Emergency Management System (Waugh 2000) . 3 Korea has also tried to integrate all-disaster management through the establishment of NEMA in 2004, as the first independent emergency management agency, and MPSS in 2014, as the first ministerial-level disaster response institution.

After Morgan Stanley's success and following other successful cases, interest in disaster mitigation action plans has increased.

In other words, disaster prevention and response responsibilities in various areas, such as facility safety, industrial safety, and marine safety, are assigned to relevant ministries in accordance with individual laws and regulations. The problem is that these ministries are also in charge of industrial promotion in the same areas. While industry promotion aims to generate economic profit according to the market principle, disaster and safety management aims to securing safety through regulation in the area of high market failure, which will cause a lot of contradictions between industry promotion and disaster and safety management. 6 Therefore, the Korean government should consider the transfer of the disaster and safety management duties of the industry promotion ministries to the disaster management coordination ministries, such as MPSS, or to establish a measure to ensure independence and transparency of disaster and safety management duties. Again, a check and balance system must be urgently secured based on the third-party inspection principle. At the same time, the important thing is to train professional officials who can implement the check and balance system. Actually, there are a few Korean universities or colleges that have a specialized program in DRM. Engineering departments dealing with floods, earthquakes, and facility collapses; firefighting departments dealing with fire and rescue service; and business management dealing with process management are covering their own areas in DRM; however, interdisciplinary study on DRM is still in its early stages.
