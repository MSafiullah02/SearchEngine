The aims of this study were to determine the overall distribution of respiratory viruses in neonates hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infectiosns (ALRI) and to describe the clinical characteristics of RSV infections in these neonates. , neonates aged <1 month who were hospitalized with ALRI and did not have underlying disease were included in the study. Viruses were identified on multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using nasal swab samples. Clinical variables were evaluated between the RSV and non-RSV infection groups. Results: Of the 108 infants included in the study, 46 (42.6%) had RSV; human rhinovirus (18.5%), human parainfluenza virus 3 (7.5%), and human metapneumovirus (3.7%) were the next most common infections. Codetections accounted for 8.3% of the cases. Crowding increased the risk of RSV infection compared to the non-RSV group (OR, 16.5; P = 0.001). The RSV group had a greater incidence of dyspnea (P = 0.027), pneumonia (P < 0.001), requirement for oxygen (P < 0.001), and prolonged hospitalization (P = 0.011) than the non-RSV group. Conclusions: RSV was the most common viral etiology in neonates without underlying diseases who were hospitalized with ALRI. The disease severity of RSV infection was worse than that of other detected viral infections. Strict prevention strategies should be considered in overcrowded situations.",

Prematurity, low birthweight, and chronic lung disease (CLD) have been suggested as risk factors for RSV infections. Additionally, epidemiologic factors, such as crowding, having older siblings, day-care center attendance and exposure to smoke are important risk factors. [8] [9] [10] [11] Very few studies have focused on neonatal RSVassociated ALRI among healthy neonates aged <1 month. 5, 12 The primary objective of this study was to determine the distribution of respiratory viruses in otherwise healthy neonates hospitalized with ALRI. A secondary aim was to identify the clinical characteristics of RSV infections in this population. recorded the following variables: history of premature birth, the presence of underlying medical conditions, breastfeeding, number of siblings, siblings attending day-care centers, number of residents at home, exposure to smoke, and residence in a neonatal day-care center in the previous 48 h. In South Korea, neonatal day-care centers are common places that provide caregivers for mothers and neonates after discharge from delivery hospitals. In these facilities, assistants take care of many neonates in a room, similar to a nursery. Respiratory infections were considered to be acquired at a neonatal day-care center if the neonates became symptomatic within 48 h of discharge from such a center. The clinical features and clinical courses during the hospitalization were summarized by one of the attending physicians who were blinded to this study. Clinical variables, such as rhinorrhea and/or cough, fever (defined as axillary temperature \u054638\u00b0C), and requirement for oxygen therapy, were recorded. Apnea was defined as a lack of breathing activity for at least 20 s. Dyspnea referred to tachypnea (respiration rate \u054660 breaths/min) combined with the presence of pronounced chest wall retractions. Pneumonia was documented only if the clinical diagnosis was confirmed on chest radiography. On admission, a blood sample was taken to measure total white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, and for blood cultures. Neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm 3 .",

Among the viruses, RSV was the predomi- nant agent (42.6%), followed by hRV (18.5%), hPIV-3 (7.5%) and hMPV (3.7%).

To demonstrate the clinical impact of respiratory viral infection on neonates, we included only full-term neonates without underlying disease. In the present study, 80.5% of the neonates who were tested on multiplex RT-PCR had positive viral results. This detection rate is slightly higher than other similar reports for infants and small children. 1, 13 One study based on hospitalized children with ALRI in Korea reported that RSV (33.2%) was the most common virus among 13 respiratory viruses and was followed by hRV (19.1%), influenza virus (16.9%), hMPV (15.4%), and hPIV (8.3%). 14 This distribution was similar to the present results, although the proportion of RSV was greater in the present study. We found that most respiratory viral infections in neonates are acquired from the community. In the present study, hRV was the second most commonly detected virus, accounting for 18.5% of detected viruses. Previous studies reported that hRV was the second most commonly detected virus, 2,15 and could result in serious lower respiratory tract disease in early life. 3, 16 Recently, several studies reported that most young infants with hRV detection had symptomatic illness, whereas half of the children in which hRV was detected were asymptomatic. 17, 18 In young infants, including neonates, the chances of colonization may be lower than in older children. Regarding these findings, hRV should be considered the main virus in the present study. Interestingly, in this study, influenza was not detected, although the study period coincided with the pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) virus. According to the Ko et al. Korean, nationwide data for 2009, infants <6 months old accounted for only 4.7% of hospitalized children with H1N1 influenza infection. 19 It appears that younger infants have relatively lower risk for influenza because of lower exposure, but additional studies, including outpatient studies, are needed to support this conclusion.",

The relatively lower percentage of codetection in the present study may be due to lower colonization in neonates and lower chances of exposure to various viruses. An association between dual viral detection and more severe disease has not been properly established. Some authors consider that any dual viral infection increases severity of disease. 20, 21 Other researchers, however, have found no difference when compared to single viral infections. 13, 22 In the present study all neonates with codetection were diagnosed with lobar pneumonia. Based on these findings, we support an association of viral codetection with a more severe clinical course. Notably, RSV is the most common cause of ALRI-associated mortality, especially in preterm infants. In the present study there were no cases of mortality. A high level of maternal RSV IgG antibodies was considered one reason for this finding because it may offer protection from severe illness in term infants during the first few months of life. 23 In South Korea, the RSV season ranges from October to March, 24 but it is reported that the season of RSV outbreaks varies considerably from year to year. 9 The present findings were similar to that expected in temperate climate zones; the incidence of RSV infections peaked from January to February 2009. This pattern, however, changed in 2010; there was no significant variation in the monthly distribution of RSV throughout the period from January to May.",

In the present study, overcrowded environments, such as neonatal day-care centers, was a strong risk factor for RSV infection.
