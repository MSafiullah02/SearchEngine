The air sampler was situated in the corner of the isolation room, approximately 1\u20131.5m above the ground, and sampled the air by actively drawing a pre-set volume of air through the sampler. Five-hundred-litre air samples were collected every 15 min over 10-h (08:00\u201318:00 h) and 24-h (08:00\u201308:00 h) periods on to non-selective tryptone soya agar (TSA) plates (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK), favourable for environmental sampling. An activity log was compiled to record room activity that may correlate with peaks in air contamination. After sampling, TSA plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h and enumerated. The total number of microbial cfu on each plate was corrected for the statistical probability of multiple particles passing through the same hole by referring to correction tables supplied with the equipment [13]. The probable count was then used to calculate the cfu/m3 sampled using the equation:X=Pr\u00d71000Vwhere V is volume of air sampled, Pr is probable count, and X is cfu per 1 m3 of air.",

However, it was interesting to observe that a patient turn activity, which resulted in a significant peak in air bioburden during the day (Figure 2c, Observations 34 and 75), had minimal effect when carried out at night. This potentially indicates that the activity of the ICU as a whole contributes to airborne contamination even within individual isolation rooms, highlighting how easily airborne micro-organisms are dispersed through the ICU in general. Studies in burns units have demonstrated the ease with which bacteria are liberated from the patient into the air [21]. One study showed that 31% of dressing changes on MRSA-positive burns patients liberated the organism into the air [22].

Bed sheet changes have also been implicated in the increase in aerial dispersal of bacteria. In the present study, this caused an average increase in air bioburden of 145.3% (N=7). Previous studies have recorded similar results whereby mean counts of airborne MRSA from infected patients increased from 4.7 cfu/m3 to 116 cfu/m3 during bed sheet changes, and remained elevated for some time after the event [25]. Similarly, air counts of up to 2614 cfu/m3 were recorded in response to bed changes in a burns unit, with elevated levels persisting for up to 60 min [14].",

A strong correlation between increased viable counts and increased Staphylococcus spp. was also observed, indicating the likelihood of increased dispersal of S. aureus when peaks in air contamination occurred. Most high-risk activities identified have been linked to high airborne bacterial levels previously, with one exception. The movement of large medical equipment into/within patient rooms caused the highest overall average increase in air bioburden at 197.6% (N=16).

However, pneumonia and respiratory tract infections were the second largest group of HAIs, and accounted for 22.4% of the total HAIs in Scotland in 2016 [26]. All airborne microbes ultimately end up depositing on to surrounding surfaces, and so can contribute indirectly to infection transmission via direct surface contact. A recent study aimed to establish a correlation between air and surface microbes in the critical care environment, further emphasizing this phenomenon [20]. Their research found a strong association between passive air sampling counts and surface counts, and made the important point that surface bacteria will include a portion of airborne bacteria after settling. Settle plate standards were also proposed in 2000, as the \u2018index of microbial air contamination\u2019, a passive form of air sampling in which microbial contamination from the air is evaluated after it has settled on to the surface of agar plates [27]. Using settle plates as part of routine environmental screening for HAI risk from airborne contaminants could be a positive addition to infection control strategies; however, as shown in the present study through active air sampling, biologically active particles are present at all times in the air of the ICU, even in unoccupied rooms. Therefore, if using passive sampling methods, care should be taken to ensure that counts are not underestimated due to the potential for droplet nuclei to remain suspended for prolonged periods [6].",

It is important to note that although certain activities resulted in high levels of air bioburden, this does not necessarily correlate with a high level of pathogenic organisms. Recently, it was shown that environmental bioburden measured by total colony count did not predict the presence of clinically relevant pathogenic organisms [28]. Additionally, viral collection was not possible with this methodology. Future consideration should be given to identification and correlation of airborne micro-organisms with strains originating from the patients housed in the environment; however, the scope of the present study was to assess overall variability of airborne bacteria and changes in response to key activities.",

Bioaerosol counts varied significantly across sampling periods; however, peaks were a direct result of room activity, particularly during the presence of increased numbers of medical staff and/or use of large equipment. Various other factors contributed to increased levels of air contamination, predominantly length of room occupation and people traffic. Although these results are specific to this ICU setting, this study provides insight into the typical background levels of airborne micro-organisms in the critical care setting, and how they change in response to the everyday operation of this dynamic environment. A greater understanding of the airborne transmission route and the clinical airborne microflora is required to understand the role of airborne pathogens in the spread of HAIs more fully, with the aim of establishing more direct and continuous infection control strategies.",
