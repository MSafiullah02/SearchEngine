The vast majority of alveolar formation occurs after birth, typically continuing until 8 to 10 years postnatally. At birth, the neonatal lung usually contains 10 to 20 million terminal air sacs (many of which are saccules rather than alveoli), one-tenth the number in the mature adult lung.

The development of a respiratory rhythm, detectable initially by intermittent rhythmic fetal thoracic movements, begins well before birth and may be necessary for normal anatomic and physiologic lung development. Interruption of umbilical blood flow at birth initiates continuous rhythmic breathing. Amniotic fluid is expelled from the lungs via the upper airways with the first few breaths, with residual fluid draining through the lymphatic and pulmonary channels in the first days of life. Changes in the partial pressures of oxygen (PO 2 ) and carbon dioxide (PCO 2 ) and in hydrogen ion concentration (pH) cause an acute decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and a consequent increase in pulmonary blood flow. Increased left atrial and decreased right atrial pressures reverse the pressure gradient across the foramen ovale, causing functional closure of this left-to-right one-way flap valve.

Development of the lung, which begins as an outgrowth of the foregut ventral wall, can be divided into several stages ( Fig.  13.1 ). During the embryonic period, in the first few weeks after conception, lung buds form as a projection of the endodermal tissue into the mesenchyme. The pseudoglandular period extends to the 17th week of life, during which rapid lung growth is accompanied by formation of the bronchi and branching of the airways down to the terminal bronchioli. Further development of bronchioli and vascularization of the airways occurs during the canalicular stage of the second trimester. The saccular stage begins at approximately 24 weeks, when terminal air sacs begin to form. The capillary networks surrounding these air spaces proliferate, allowing sufficient pulmonary gas exchange for extrauterine survival of the premature neonate by 26 to 28 weeks. Formation of alveoli trolateral medulla, are thought to be the respiratory rhythm generators. 3 These neuron groups fire in an oscillating pattern, an inherent rhythm that is moderated by inputs from other respiratory centers. Involuntary integration of sensory input occurs in various respiratory nuclei and neural complexes in the pons and medulla that modify the baseline pacemaker firing of the respiratory rhythm generators. The cerebral cortex also affects breathing rhythm and influences or overrides involuntary rhythm generation in response to conscious or subconscious activity, such as emotion, arousal, pain, speech, breath-holding, and other activities. 2 The effectors of ventilation include the neural efferent pathways, the muscles of respiration, the bones and cartilage of the chest wall and airway, and elastic connective tissue. Upper airway patency is maintained by connective tissue and by sustained and cyclic contractions of the pharyngeal dilator muscles. The diaphragm produces the majority of tidal volume during quiet inspiration, with the intercostal, abdominal, and accessory muscles (sternocleidomastoid and neck muscles) providing additional negative pressure. The elastic recoil of the lungs and thorax produces expiration. Inspiration is an active and expiration a passive action in normal lungs during quiet breathing. During vigorous breathing or with airway obstruction, both inspiration and expiration become active processes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 136, "end": 137, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1295, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1867, "end": 1868, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 443, "end": 453, "text": "Fig.  13.1", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Respiratory Physiology"}, {"text": "Another effect of age is a change in chest wall compliance.

Alveolar filling defects (e.g., lobar pneumonia) also reduce lung volume and can be considered as restrictive processes. Although the diseases arise from specific isolated genetic disorders, children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and sickle cell disease (SCD) can have highly variable pulmonary pathologic processes with both obstructive and restrictive components of lung disease. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia may also result in both obstructive and restrictive pathology. Pulmonary function tests can also be used to differentiate fixed from variable airway obstruction and to localize the obstruction as above or below the thoracic inlet (Figs. 13.5 through 13.7, E- Fig. 13 .1). This information can be gleaned from distinctive changes in the configuration of the flow-volume loop, a graphic representation of inspiratory and expiratory flow volumes plotted against time. A fixed central airway obstruction, such as a tumor or stenosis, may obstruct both inspiration and expiration, flattening the flow-volume curve on both inspiration and expiration (see Video 14.1). The child with tracheal stenosis, for example, has flattening of both inhalation and exhalation curves (see Fig. 13 .6). A variable obstruction tends to affect only one part of the ventilatory cycle. On inhalation, the chest expands and draws the airways open. On exhalation, as the chest collapses, the intrathoracic airways collapse.

In some children the development of chronic inflammation may be associated with permanent airway changes, referred to as airway remodeling, that are not prevented by or fully responsive to current available treatments. There is a strong association between asthma and atopy, or immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity. 37 The diagnosis of asthma can be challenging because cough, wheezing, and bronchospasm may arise from many disease processes. Asthma itself is unlikely to be a single disease entity, and the disease process is markedly modified by various genetic and environmental factors. 37, 40 Many young children wheeze, and there is no definitive confirmatory blood, histologic, or radiographic It is difficult to define asthma with precision because the exact pathophysiology remains unclear. The word asthma derives from the Greek aazein, which means \"to breathe with open mouth or to pant.\" 40 A working definition of asthma is a common chronic disorder of the airways that is complex and characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, airway obstruction, inflammation, and hyperresponsiveness of the airways. 37 Clinical expressions of asthma include wheezing, chest tightness or discomfort, persistent dry cough, and dyspnea on exertion. Severe respiratory distress can occur during acute exacerbations and may be characterized by chest wall retraction, use of accessory muscles, prolonged expiration, pneumothorax, and progression Causes of Wheezing in Children diagnostic test. Given the difficulty with diagnosis, the label \"preschool wheezers\" may be a more appropriate description for young children with reversible airway obstruction than a diagnosis of \"asthma.\" 40 The Tucson birth cohort study was the largest longitudinal study in the United States to attempt to differentiate wheezing or asthma phenotypes in children who did not subsequently develop asthma. [41] [42] [43] This study examined 826 children at ages 3 years and 6 years from a cohort of 1246 neonates. By the age of 6 years, 48.5% of the children had experienced at least one documented episode of wheezing and were categorized into three groups. \"Transient wheezers\" were children who wheezed only in response to viral infections, typically during the first 3 years of life. \"Non-atopic wheezers\" were children who wheezed beyond the first few years of life, often in response to viral infections, but who were less likely to persistently wheeze in later childhood. \"Atopy-associated wheezers\" were children who had a reversible wheeze together with a tendency toward IgE-mediated hypersensitivity; they had the greatest risk of persistent symptoms into late childhood and adulthood. 41 The development of asthma is a complex process that probably involves the interaction of two crucial elements: host factors (specifically genetic modifiers of inflammation) and environmental exposures (e.g., viral infections, environmental allergens, pollution) that occur during a crucial time in the development of the immune system. 37 Therefore, the population of young children who wheeze includes a spectrum of disorders rather than one specific pathologic process.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 138, "end": 141, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 142, "end": 144, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 235, "end": 236, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 400, "end": 402, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1036, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1309, "end": 1312, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1313, "end": 1315, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1842, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2402, "end": 2404, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2602, "end": 2606, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2607, "end": 2611, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2612, "end": 2616, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3393, "end": 3395, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3732, "end": 3734, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "LOWER AIRWAY DISEASE"}, {"text": "Asthma must be differentiated from other distinct causes that produce similar symptoms (Table 13 .5).

Early features of lung damage include decreased distal pulmonary vascularity and diffuse interstitial fibrosis, whereas later stages are characterized by pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular hypertrophy. 116, 121 Pulmonary function testing can reveal the need for bronchodilators and the presence of obstructive or restrictive lung disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 370, "end": 373, "text": "81,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 374, "end": 376, "text": "82", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 772, "end": 776, "text": "[82]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 777, "end": 781, "text": "[83]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 782, "end": 786, "text": "[84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 918, "end": 920, "text": "77", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 936, "end": 940, "text": "111,", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 941, "end": 945, "text": "113,", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 946, "end": 949, "text": "114", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 1235, "end": 1238, "text": "110", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1321, "text": "116", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1551, "end": 1554, "text": "117", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}, {"start": 1619, "end": 1622, "text": "118", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 1683, "end": 1687, "text": "116,", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1688, "end": 1692, "text": "119,", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 1693, "end": 1696, "text": "120", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1927, "end": 1931, "text": "116,", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1932, "end": 1935, "text": "120", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 2149, "end": 2152, "text": "119", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 2336, "end": 2339, "text": "116", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 2893, "end": 2897, "text": "116,", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 2898, "end": 2901, "text": "121", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 355, "end": 367, "text": "(Table 13.7)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Notes:"}, {"text": "Although the risk of developing ACS in the perioperative period is increased, distinct genotypes, wide variation in disease severity, differing chronic treatment protocols, varied surgical procedures, and logistical complexities have made research into the optimal perioperative management difficult.

Diagnostic criteria include a new pulmonary infiltrate involving at least one lung segment on the radiograph (excluding atelectasis) combined with one or more symptoms or signs of chest pain, pyrexia greater than 101.3\u00b0F (38.5\u00b0C), tachypnea, wheezing, or cough. [107] [108] [109] Precipitants include infection, fat embolism after bone marrow infarction, pulmonary infarction, and surgical procedures. [109] [110] [111] Potential risk factors for the development and severity of perioperative ACS may include a history of lung disease, recent clustering of acute pulmonary complications, pregnancy, increased age, and the invasiveness of the surgical procedure. 104 ACS was associated with younger-age patients, reduced body temperature, and greater blood loss in a study of 60 children with SCD undergoing laparoscopic surgery. 112 The risk of ACS is small (<5%) after minor surgeries such as inguinal hernia repair and distal extremity surgery, whereas it is severalfold greater (10% to 15%) after intraabdominal and major oxygenation of blood returning from nonventilated parts of the lung, increasing venous oxygen levels can improve arterial oxygen content. Although transfusion has not been directly linked to improved outcomes, both exchange and simple transfusions can improve oxygenation. 109 Summary Pulmonary complications are a major cause of perioperative morbidity in the pediatric population. Although preexisting pulmonary pathologic processes in children can present significant challenges to anesthetic delivery, a thorough assessment of the problem combined with meticulous anesthetic management allows most children to undergo surgical interventions without long-term adverse sequelae. Consultation with a pediatric pulmonologist is indicated when appropriate for specific problems as outlined in this chapter; a team approach may markedly improve operative and postoperative outcomes. The risk of ACS after low-risk surgeries or procedures without transfusion appears to be small. 123 A study of patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with deep sedation reported an incidence of ACS of 1.2% within 1 month of the MRI, 124 whereas nontransfused patients undergoing minor surgery in the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease had a similar incidence of ACS of 1.4%. 110 A survey of North American pediatric anesthesiologists found that most clinicians do not transfuse children who are at low risk for perioperative complications after minor procedures, whereas a greater number transfuse sicker children undergoing more invasive procedures. 125 The one group of children with SCD who are at high risk for complications are those who have experienced or are at risk for a stroke. Risk factors for strokes include low hemoglobin, hypertension, and male gender as well as three single-nucleotide polymorphisms. 126, 127 Serial transcranial Doppler ultrasound and MRI of the brain have been used to detect pathologic changes in blood flow or subclinical strokes, respectively, and in these children blood transfusion has been effective in reducing subsequent strokes. 128, 129 Silent cerebral strokes have been detected in up to 30% of asymptomatic children with SCD. 126 To reduce the risk of stroke, these children have transfusions at regular intervals, based on the results of the serial investigations. However, this approach raises concern about iron overload and other complications associated with repeated blood transfusions. A recent study to limit the number of transfusions in those at risk for a stroke had to be stopped prematurely because two strokes occurred despite serial transcranial Doppler monitoring. 130 Chronic hydroxyurea therapy has also been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of stroke. 131 The perioperative management of children with a history of stroke continues to evolve.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 328, "end": 333, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 334, "end": 339, "text": "[108]", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 340, "end": 345, "text": "[109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 468, "end": 473, "text": "[109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 474, "end": 479, "text": "[110]", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 480, "end": 485, "text": "[111]", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 728, "end": 731, "text": "104", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 895, "end": 898, "text": "112", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1367, "text": "109", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 2068, "end": 2071, "text": "123", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 2219, "end": 2222, "text": "124", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 2367, "end": 2370, "text": "110", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 2643, "end": 2646, "text": "125", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 2910, "end": 2914, "text": "126,", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 2915, "end": 2918, "text": "127", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 3166, "end": 3170, "text": "128,", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 3171, "end": 3174, "text": "129", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 3266, "end": 3269, "text": "126", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 3721, "end": 3724, "text": "130", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 3821, "end": 3824, "text": "131", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SICKLE CELL DISEASE"}, {"text": "Children with SCD frequently develop postoperative atelectasis.
