The main phytoalexins of orchids are 9,10-dihydrophenanthrenes. Orchinol was the first phytoalexin to be isolated, from Orchis militaris infected with Rhizoctonia repens (Boller et al. 1957) . Loroglossol, an isomer of orchinol, was next isolated from Loroglossum hircinum infected with Rhizoctonia versicolor (Hardegger et al. 1963) , followed by hircinol. More than 40 dihydrophenanthrene phytoalexins have been isolated from orchids, and many, including the three original phytoalexins, have been synthesised (Stoessl and Arditti 1984) . Feeding experiments using radioactive L-phenylalanineas as a precursor demonstrated that the biosynthetic sequence for production of 9,10-dihydrophenanthrenes starts with L-phenylalanine and passes through mcoumaric acid, dihydro-m-coumaric acid, and 3,3 0 ,5-trihydroxybibenzyl (Fritzememeier and Kindl 1983) . From their biosynthesis, dihydrophenanthrenes can be classified as stilbenoids because they are derivatives of dihydrostilbenes or bibenzyls (Reinecke and Kindl 1994) .

Nevertheless, upon destruction of the mycorrhiza, phytoalexin production increases in proportion to the amount of fungal material present (Gehlert and Kindl 1991) . In young, sterile plants of Phalaenopsis, bibenzyls and their oxidative products, the 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene phytoalexins, are not present. Following infection with fungi, such as Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia spp., there is a greater than 100-fold increase in bibenzyl synthase activity. This is the key enzyme for the formation of phytoalexins (Reinecke and Kindl 1994b) .
