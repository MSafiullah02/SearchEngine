Here we characterize a likely effector protein bearing a deubiquitylase (DUB) domain from the obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus. The Ulp1like DUB prefers ubiquitin substrates over ubiquitin-like proteins and efficiently cleaves polyubiquitin chains of three or more ubiquitins. The co-crystal structure of the DUB (OtDUB) domain with ubiquitin revealed three bound ubiquitins: one engages the S1 site, the second binds an S2 site contributing to chain specificity and the third binds a unique ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD). The UBD modulates OtDUB activity, undergoes a pronounced structural transition upon binding ubiquitin, and binds monoubiquitin with an unprecedented~5 nM dissociation constant. The characterization and high-resolution structure determination of this enzyme should aid in its development as a drug target to counter Orientia infections.",

Degradation of specific proteins is critical for countless cellular functions and begins with the covalent modification of substrate proteins with ubiquitin. Substrate attachment occurs between the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal glycine and a substrate residue (typically lysine). Ubiquitin itself bears seven lysine residues that can be ubiquitylated, in addition to its N-terminal \u03b1-amino group, leading to the formation of various ubiquitin polymers 1 . Two of the most common polymers are linked through the K48 or K63 residues of ubiquitin. K48 poly-ubiquitin-chain attachment frequently leads to degradation of the substrate by the proteasome, while K63 poly-ubiquitin chains are known signals for autophagy, intracellular membrane protein trafficking, and DNA repair [2] [3] [4] .",

It showed no activity toward the Ubls ISG15-AMC or SUMO1-AMC and weak activity toward NEDD8-AMC, similar to other bacterial CE-clan DUBs 11, 15 . To determine if OtDUB 1-259 had any preferences for specific ubiquitin-ubiquitinchain linkages, we screened a di-ubiquitin panel, including all seven lysine linkages and linear di-ubiquitin. OtDUB 1-259 could cleave multiple chain linkages, including K6, K11, K33, K48, and K63 (Fig. 1e) . A preference was observed for K33-linked chains, a poorly studied linkage type associated with immune responses and secretory pathway trafficking [31] [32] [33] .

Our biochemical assays revealed a UBD within the noncanonical VR-1 of OtDUB (Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 1b, c) . To analyze the structural basis of the substrate preferences of OtDUB, we assembled a complex of OtDUB 1-259 with free ubiquitin and determined the crystal structure of the complex at 2.2 \u00c5 resolution. Three ubiquitin molecules bound to each OtDUB fragment ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). One ubiquitin is bound to the active site (Ub S1 , gray) and represents the distal ubiquitin that would remain after cleavage of the proximal ubiquitin at the S1\u2032 site (absent from the structure, Fig. 2b ). The position of Ub S1 in the OtDUB complex is rotated nearly 90\u00b0r elative to the position of Ub S1 in complexes with XopD and SdeA (Fig. 2c) . Overall, Ub S1 binding to OtDUB buries an extensive interface of nearly 1200 \u00c5 2 , and results in modest conformational changes in OtDUB (overall RMSD < 1.5 \u00c5) attributable mostly to a slight (~10\u00b0) rotation of VR-1 towards Ub S1 . We also observed the density for two additional ubiquitin molecules: one bound to the side of the OtDUB that we propose represents the S2 site (pink, Fig. 2) , and a third ubiquitin molecule (yellow) bound to the backside of VR-1 far from the active site, which likely represents the biochemically identified UBD (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 1c ).",

WT enzyme cleaved K63-and K48-linked poly-ubiquitin with similar efficiencies as measured by loss of tetra-ubiquitin (Fig. 3c, d) . By contrast, the F59T mutation significantly decreased the percentage of K63-linked tetra-ubiquitin cleaved, but caused only small decreases in activity against K48-linked poly-ubiquitin at early time points. These data bolster the assertion that the ubiquitin bound to the side of VR-2 (the S2 site) represents the most distally bound ubiquitin in a K63-linked chain (n \u2265 3) and provide a structural explanation for how extended K63-linked ubiquitin chains are accommodated in the OtDUB structure.

We next examined the S1 site to determine if any of the interactions with Ub S1 could influence substrate specificity. The C terminus of Ub S1 adopts an extended conformation and is positioned by a highly conserved di-acidic motif (OtDUB E16/D17), present in the CR of all CE-clan proteases, and by hydrophobic residues (OtDUB H38/H71/W77) that recognize L73 of ubiquitin ( Fig. 4a , left panel). The Ub S1 itself is sandwiched between two OtDUB regions: on one side it contacts VR-2, which creates a hydrophobic pocket (OtDUB I36/V39/L46/T50) for G47 of ubiquitin, and on the other, VR-1 uses charged residues (OtDUB R196/E238/R242) to interact with oppositely charged residues of ubiquitin, a noncanonical ubiquitin surface for S1 site interactions (Fig. 4a, right panel) . In contrast to its structural compatibility with binding K63 di-ubiquitin chains (Fig. 2b) , when Ub S1 is aligned with the proximal ubiquitin in K48 di-ubiquitin from published K48-chain structures, the distal ubiquitin clashes with the DUB domain ( Supplementary Fig. 4a ). Nevertheless, OtDUB cleaves K48-linked ubiquitin chains (Fig. 3c, f) , suggesting that it repositions K48-linked chains for catalysis using distinct determinants.",

Both OtDUB double mutants inhibited K48-chain cleavage, showing a significant impairment by 10 min (Fig. 4c ). By contrast, cleavage of K63-linked chains was not affected. Analysis of these mutations with Ub-AMC also revealed a slight decrease in enzyme activity (Fig. 4d ), but the E238A/R242A mutant had no significant effect on K63 or K48 di-ubiquitin cleavage (Fig. 4e, f) . These data show that the noncanonical VR-1 is required for full DUB activity against extended chains and suggest that ubiquitin binding at the K63-chain-favoring S2 site can override impaired binding to the S1 site by long K63 chains but not K48 chains.",

Alanine mutation of any one of the three hydrophobic residues in the ubiquitin I44 patch reduces or abolishes binding to most UBDs [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] .

Charge-neutralizing mutations (D204A/ D208A and N222A/D226A) did not reduce binding to ubiquitin, and even charge reversals could not fully disrupt binding (Fig. 5d) . These analyses suggest that the OtDUB UBD binds ubiquitin with high affinity. We used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to quantify the ubiquitin-OtDUB UBD interaction (Fig. 5e) . Titration of OtDUB 170-264 (the UBD) with ubiquitin revealed a dissociation constant (K d ) of 5 \u00b1 4 nM and a stoichiometry of n = 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 ( Table 1 ). The K d of OtDUB UBD for mono-ubiquitin is more than two orders of magnitude tighter than for any previously reported natural UBD 42, 43 .

When ubiquitin was titrated in at equimolar amounts, the spectrum originally characterized by broadened, low-intensity resonances shifted to a dispersed and well-resolved spectrum containing many new resonance peaks, characteristic of a fully folded structure. A substantial structural transition of the UBD was supported by the apo-DUB-UBD 1-311 crystal structure (Fig. 1a) , which lacked density for residues 224-235 at the beginning of the UBD, a region that includes the ubiquitin-interacting residues D226 and K230.

Because ubiquitin (Ub UBD ) stabilizes the UBD fold, it should affect the contribution of the opposing VR-1 surface to ubiquitin binding at the S1 site (Fig. 4) . We therefore tested for effects on OtDUB DUB activity. K48 di-ubiquitin was cleaved faster by the OtDUB 1-259 -V203D mutant, a variant that abolishes UBD-Ub UBD binding (Fig. 5b) and was indifferent to ubiquitin preincubation (Fig. 6a, b) . When WT OtDUB 1-259 was preincubated with ubiquitin, it cleaved K48 di-ubiquitin faster than the V203D mutant (Fig. 6a, b) . These results suggest the UBD sequesters K48 di-ubiquitin away from the active site, an effect that is blocked by pre-binding the UBD with ubiquitin. The higher activity of WT OtDUB 1-259 toward K48 di-ubiquitin when preincubated with ubiquitin is likely due to VR-1 fully folding when the UBD is occupied (Fig. 5f) , while only partially folding in the context of V203D. To test directly the contribution of ubiquitin binding to the S1 site surface from VR-1, WT OtDUB 1-259 and the E238A/ R242A derivative were incubated with ubiquitin prior to K48 diubiquitin cleavage. As expected, the E238A/R242A mutant showed significantly reduced cleavage for K48 (Fig. 6c, d) , and had no effect on K63 di-ubiquitin cleavage (Fig. 6c , Supplementary Fig. 6b) .",

When the V203D variant was assayed for Ub-AMC cleavage, we also see a reduced activity compared to OtDUB 1-259 ; the activity was identical to that of OtDUB 1-177 , which lacks the UBD altogether (see Fig. 6f ). This reduced activity between OtDUB 1-177 and OtDUB 1 -259 was also observed for diubiquitin cleavage (Supplementary Fig. 2c ).

To test this, we analyzed the ability of the S2 site mutant OtDUB 1-259 -F59T to cleave K63 di-ubiquitin. As predicted, the F59T mutant cleaved K63 di-ubiquitin significantly faster than WT (Fig. 6e, g) .

The two protein fragments were incubated with increasing molar equivalents of ubiquitin.

OtDUB 1-177 -C135A could bind two ubiquitins based on the progressive shift of the DUB protein from the D column fractions to the earlier (larger protein-containing) A and B fractions as ubiquitin levels were increased. OcDUB 1-177 -C134A, on the other hand, maintained a comparable elution pattern across the titration from 1.0 to 2.5 ubiquitin equivalents and never migrated to fraction A, suggesting the absence of a second (S2) site. When the S2 site mutation F59T is introduced (OtDUB 1-177 -F59T, C135A) the elution pattern mirrors OcDUB 1-177 -C134A, suggesting that F59T alone is sufficient to disrupt the S2 site of OtDUB (Fig. 7f) .

When various K48 di-ubiquitin crystal structures are aligned with OtDUB Ub S1 , there are clashes between the DUB and the distal ubiquitins ( Supplementary  Fig. 4a) . However, the flexibility of the ubiquitin C-terminal segment allows the distal ubiquitin in a K48-type chain to adopt many conformations; indeed, two known conformations of a K48 ubiquitin dimer bound to an enzyme 46,47 can be readily modeled into the S1 site with minimal clash at VR-2 of OtDUB (Supplementary Fig. 4b) .

Unlike these CE-clan proteases, the OtDUB VR harbors two separate ubiquitin-binding interfaces, both of which have been captured structurally. Interestingly, OtDUB UBD :ubiquitin interaction strongly promotes DUB activity at high OtDUB concentrations. Saturation of the UBD with free ubiquitin both reduces competition for ubiquitylated substrates at the DUB active site and enhances S1 site formation by promoting folding of VR-1/UBD, which increases K48-chain recognition.

The high cytoplasmic levels of free ubiquitin may guarantee a fully activated DUB. The OtDUB UBD -ubiquitin interaction has unusual biophysical properties as well. Although the ubiquitin surface area buried by the bound OtDUB UBD (~17% of the ubiquitin surface) is virtually identical to that of one of the tightest UBDs with an available crystal structure, the CUE domain of Vps9, the binding affinity of the OtDUB UBD for ubiquitin is more than three orders of magnitude tighter 49 . Other properties of OtDUB UBD must therefore account for its tight association with ubiquitin. The OtDUB UBD utilizes a central hydrophobic interaction surface that contacts all three hydrophobic residues in the canonical Ile44 patch of ubiquitin 44 and is further stabilized by complementary electrostatic interactions surrounding the hydrophobic patch 38 . Shape complementarity (Sc) 50 may also help explain the tight affinity for ubiquitin. The calculated Sc value (obtained in CCP4) of the OtDUB UBD :ubiquitin interface shows it to be one of the most complementary (0.65) interfaces among known UBDs; it is surpassed only by two other UBDs crystallized with ubiquitin, Rabex5 (0.69) and the Cbl-b UBA domain (0.72) 51, 52 . While no single one of the aforementioned factors alone is sufficient, the combination of these and possibly other determinants may account for the exceptional affinity of the OtDUB UBD for ubiquitin, despite the entropic cost of UBD folding upon ubiquitin binding.",

The co-crystal structure of the DUB-UBD segment with ubiquitin revealed multiple ubiquitin-binding sites that can rationalize the specificity of the enzyme for longer ubiquitin chains and the high affinity of the UBD for ubiquitin. These characteristics are conserved in the O. chuto homolog, suggesting that this protein is critical for pathogenicity.

Initially, no solution was found by PHASER; therefore, the apo model was split into two domains: the DUB (1-169) and VR-1/UBD (171-259), and an initial solution was found with two copies of each fragment per asymmetric unit (asu). Using the modified OtDUB 1-259 model with domain conformations from the initial search, two additional copies of OtDUB 1-259 were found within the asu. The initial model was first improved with several rounds of restrained refinement in Refmac5 59 , and additional rounds of molecular replacement were attempted with human ubiquitin (PDB ID: 1UBQ) as the search model. Unexpectedly, PHASER was unable to find any copies of ubiquitin within the unit cell despite extensive difference density and readily identifiable secondary structure. Therefore, individual molecules of ubiquitin were manually docked into the electron density in Coot, and iterative rounds of restrained refinement improved phases such that sidechain density for all three unique molecules of ubiquitin emerged. In total, four molecules of the OtDUB fragment and 12 molecules of ubiquitin were placed within the asu. The model was rebuilt in Coot according to the 2F o -F c map, followed by iterative rounds of restrained, translation/libration/screw and twin refinement, with twin operator (\u2212h, \u2212k, \u2212l) and twin fraction \u03b1 = 0.26.
