This study, together with subsequent studies of BMT recipients at the University of Minnesota, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), and other centers, established several salient features of the disease.6, 8, 11, 12, 17 RSV was not only capable of causing serious pneumonias in adult BMT recipients, but it did so frequently during community outbreaks. RSV infections in adult BMT recipients followed the same clinical sequence as in children, with upper respiratory illness preceding pneumonia. The frequency of progression to pneumonia was highest in pre-engrafted transplant recipients; however, the mortality associated with pneumonia was similarly high in pre- and post-engrafted patients. Aerosolized ribavirin alone appeared to be of some benefit if it was started prior to the onset of pneumonia; if it was started after the onset of pneumonia, the mortality rate was >70%.",

Even when therapy has been initiated before the onset of respiratory failure, the mortality rates associated with RSV and CMV pneumonia have been high (31% and 58%, respectively). Because of the high overall mortality rate with viral pneumonia (61% for RSV pneumonia and 79% for CMV pneumonia), the approach to RSV disease will probably need to be modeled after the strategies that have been worked out for CMV disease, namely, prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy at an early stage of the viral illness.

As in the transplant recipients, the onset of illness was characterized by an upper respiratory illness in all patients. The frequency of progression to pneumonia was considerably higher among myelosuppressed (absolute neutrophil count \u2264500/mL) than among non-myelosuppressed patients, as it had been higher among more recently transplanted, more myelosuppressed BMT recipients. Thus, the upper respiratory illnesses were complicated by pneumonia in 15 (71%) of 21 patients who were myelosuppressed compared with 2 (20%) of 10 patients who were not myelosuppressed. The mortality rate associated with pneumonia in the setting of myelosuppression was high (53%). In contrast, none of the 10 non-myelosuppressed patients died.",

In some subsets of patients with a high frequency of progression to pneumonia, pre-emptive therapy for upper respiratory illnesses will need to be considered. The simplest and most effective therapy is prevention, through infection-control measures and postponement or dose-modification of chemotherapy (if feasible), in high-risk patients with RSV upper respiratory illnesses.

The morbidity and mortality of influenza, as well as the other community respiratory viruses, appear to be related to the type, degree, and duration of immunosuppression. In less immunocompromised patients, the clinical course of influenza may be more comparable to that in immunocompetent persons. It is also noteworthy that, unlike RSV, influenza viruses undergo frequent antigenic variation and prevalent types and serotypes vary, so the morbidity and mortality may be expected to vary from year to year.",

The significant number of pneumonias that resolved with antibacterial/antifungal therapy alone as well as the high frequency of concurrent opportunistic infections (which may mask a potential benefit of therapy) make it clear that therapeutic trials for parainfluenza virus-associated pneumonia will need to be controlled.
