Both of these members of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are used to reduce prostate volume pharmacologically (3) . Therapeutic effect is mediated by decreasing intraprostatic level of DHT (Dihydrotestosterone). DHT is more potent than testosterone at maintaining normal prostate weight and stroma volume (4). The influence of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors on prostate is well established but 5-alpha-reductase is also an enzyme associated with androgen metabolism in many organs. Consequently, we introduce hypothesis that 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors may disrupt androgens metabolism in lungs, which in turn may have a negative impact on course of COVID-19 infection.",

It is likely that in mature lung tissue, the androgen regulative pathways analogously to fetal ones are also active. The expression of major regulative enzymes 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 5 alpha-reductase was detected in adult lung tissue. Interestingly, it was shown that balanced interplay of both enzymes is physiologically adjusted to obtain precisely regulated androgen inactivation within lungs. Therefore, in contrast to prostate, the physiological function of 5 alpha-reductase in lungs is to locally minimalize androgen potential (11) . This action profile is a result of low 5 alphareductase affinity to testosterone and high to androstadiene with respiratory epithelium.",
