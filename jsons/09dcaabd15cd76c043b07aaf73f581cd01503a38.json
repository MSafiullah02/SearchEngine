This predictive task is challenging due to the novelty of the virus, limited data, and dynamic political and societal responses. We embed a Bayesian nonlinear mixed model and a random forest algorithm within an epidemiological compartmental model for empirically grounded COVID-19 predictions. The Bayesian case model fits a location-specific curve to the velocity (first derivative) of the transformed cumulative case count, borrowing strength across geographic locations and incorporating prior information to obtain a posterior distribution for case trajectory. The compartmental model uses this distribution and predicts deaths using a random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics, yielding daily projections and interval estimates for infections and deaths in U.S. states. We evaluate forecasting accuracy on a two-week holdout set, finding that the model predicts COVID-19 cases and deaths well, with a mean absolute scaled error of 0.40 for cases and 0.32 for deaths throughout the two-week evaluation period. The substantial variation in predicted trajectories and associated uncertainty between states is illustrated by comparing three unique locations: New York, Ohio, and Mississippi. The sophistication and accuracy of this COVID-19 model offer reliable predictions and uncertainty estimates for the current trajectory of the pandemic in the U.S. and provide a platform for future predictions as shifting political and societal responses alter its course.",

Bridging this divide, we combine the strengths of curve-fitting statistical models and the structure of epidemiological models, by embedding a Bayesian nonlinear mixed model for case velocity and a machine learning algorithm (random : medRxiv preprint forest) into the framework of a compartmental model. Fusing these models together exploits the particular strengths of each to glean as much information as possible from the currently available data. We also identify the velocity of log cumulative cases as an excellent target for modeling and extrapolating COVID-19 case trajectories. We empirically evaluate the predictive performance of the model and provide predicted trajectories with credible intervals for cumulative confirmed case count, active confirmed infections and COVID-19 deaths for each of the 50 U.S. states. Combining sophisticated data analytic methods with proven epidemiological models offers an empirically grounded strategy for making realistic predictions and quantifying their uncertainty. These predictions indicate substantial variation in the COVID-19 trajectories of U.S. states. : medRxiv preprint often resort to modeling transmission rate changes by applying an adjustment factor 36 that modifies transmission rates upward or downward in a somewhat ad hoc manner.",

This is a promising approach, but 39 to be useful for forecasting, estimates of \u03b2(t) must extrapolate beyond the observed 40 data to describe transmission at unobserved times and not simply interpolate the 41 observed data, which is straightforward with a flexible model. Two studies have paired 42 machine learning algorithms with their COVID-19 compartmental models to model 43 time-varying effects, which is a promising approach at least when inference on the 44 inputs to \u03b2 is not required.

Most COVID-19 models are compartmental models , a type of 10 mathematical model used by epidemiologists to simulate infectious disease epidemics for 11 over a century. Compartmental models divide a population into mutually exclusive 12 compartments that denote disease status and supply a set of differential equations that 13 define the flow of the population between compartments [62] . Traditionally they are 14 named after their compartments with the SIR (susceptible-infectious-recovered) [63] and 15 SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) models classic examples. 16 In an infectious disease compartmental model, S(t) is the number of susceptible 17 individuals at time t, and new infections are represented by the flow of individuals out 18 of the S compartment. This is governed by the first derivative of S(t) with respect to 19 time, dS(t)/dt. Classic SIR and SEIR models express this as proportional to the ",

It may also be normalized in Eq 1 by 25 division with the total population size. 26 The simplest approach for simulating infections is to assume a value for \u03b2 or its 27 constituent parts from the literature or other prior information [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . While this is 28 convenient, the predictive accuracy can suffer. Another approach that has been used by 29 other studies is to estimate \u03b2 (or a related quantity) by fitting a statistical model or 30 other optimization procedure to observed data . This empirical approach can 31 make these models more realistic, but they still may be limited in their ability to 32 accurately model the COVID-19 pandemic. Disease transmission rates in COVID-19 33 have changed substantially over time depending upon the political and societal responses 34 and possibly other factors [54] . As a result, modelers operating within this framework network that models time-varying transmission by estimating intervention efficiency 48 from reported data as a function of time [42] . 49 Recovery, death, and other states (e.g., hospitalization) may be incorporated into the 50 model as separate compartments. Solutions to the differential system provide values for 51 each compartment at each time, allowing for easy joint modelling of disease states once 52 their derivative is specified. This is an advantage of compartmental models over many 53 other approaches, which may require separate models for each quantity. 54 A number of agent-based COVID-19 models have been developed or adapted from 55 influenza pandemic models to simulate the individuals of a population and their 56 interactions [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] . This provides a mechanism for modelling interventions that target 57 contacts between individuals and does not assume the population exists in homogeneous 58 compartments as compartmental models generally do, but also requires a number of 59 assumptions to be made on the behavior and interactions within a population as well as 60 the infectivity of COVID-19. 61 Serial growth models for COVID-19 simulate an epidemic by expressing the number 62 of new infections at a given time as a weighted sum of new infections on previous days 63 usually scaled by the reproductive number, which may be time-varying [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . The 64 weights are sampled from a probability distribution defining the amount of time between 65 an individual being infected and infecting another person. Deaths or other outcomes 66 may be modelled as a second step, for example using a negative binomial model that 67 predicts daily deaths conditional on the number of infections in recent days [70] . 68 Statistical models often eschew deterministic population dynamics and fit the 69 observed data as a function of time and possibly other covariates in a regression (or 70 equivalent) framework. Log-linear [74] , generalized Richards [75] , ARIMA [76, 77] , 71 exponential [78] , Gaussian CDF [79] , and logistic [80] [81] [82] models, which all 72 accommodate the generally sigmoidal shape of the cumulative infection count that is 73 often observed in epidemics, as well as various other models [83] [84] [85] [86] including machine 74 learning algorithms [87] [88] [89] have been proposed for COVID-19. Murray et al. and 75 Woody et al. take similar approaches for modeling COVID-19 deaths using the error 76 function (ERF) [90, 91] . Modeling deaths is appealing, because COVID-19 deaths have 77 been more reliably reported than infections. However, because deaths lag infections by 78 some amount of time, it may not enable projections to incorporate the latest 79 information on disease spread. 80 Within the framework of a statistical (or other regression-like) model, it is easier to 81 fit observed data, assuming an appropriate functional form is selected, but it may be 82 challenging to accurately project the future trajectory of an epidemic. Time-varying 83 covariates like mobile phone tracking data [91] , Google trends [89, 92] , and social 84 media [93] are easily incorporated into such a model and may be quite predictive, but 85 they are often unknown in the future, requiring assumptions to be made regarding their 86 future values when forecasting. Such approaches can only model one outcome (e.g., infections or deaths) and additional steps must be taken to predict other quantities. 88 Here we present an approach to projecting COVID-19 cases and deaths that employs providing location-specific trajectories that extrapolate well within a full probability 92 model that includes uncertainty quantification. We use a random forest algorithm for 93 the death transition function that learns the relationship between COVID-19 cases and 94 population characteristics to predict deaths. The remaining sections of this paper lay 95 out the SIRD compartmental model, the Bayesian mixed model for case velocity, the 96 random forest death model, and close with results and a discussion. 97 Materials and methods 98 The SIRD Compartmental Model 99 We model the spread and progression of COVID-19 through a population using a SIRD compartmental model named after the four compartments into which it partitions the population: S for susceptible, I for infectious, R for recovered, and D for dead. The number of population members in each compartment is a function of time, t, and these functions are linked by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern the flow of the population through the different disease states: will not substantially alter inference in the short term.",
