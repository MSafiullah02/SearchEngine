Briefly, it is an assembly of nine microtubular doublets surrounding two central microtubular singlets. Each doublet has two rows of \u2018dynein arms\u2019, which contain the motor protein \u2018dynein\u2019. The dynein arms are able to walk on the back of the neighbouring doublet, which results in bending of the cilium. There are also so\u2010called nexin links, which are assumed to restrict the extent of sliding and to keep the array of doublets intact, and there are spokes (also called radial links) between the nine doublets and a \u2018central sheath\u2019, both probably with skeletal functions (Figure 1). The cilium emerges as an outgrowth from a basal body, which it resembles. The basal body is sometimes also named the centriole. It consists of nine microtubular triplets but has no central singlets.",

            "text": "There are at least eight categories of cilia or cilia\u2010derived organelles in the human body:\n(1)\nMucus\u2010propelling cilia. These are motile, have a 9 + 2 structure with dynein arms, and a length of about 6 \u00b5m. Typically, a large number of cilia (200 or more) project from the upper surface of a ciliated cell. Their function is to propel a mucus blanket that rests on the ciliary tips. This is done with a to\u2010and\u2010fro movement in which cilia in their effective down\u2010stroke push the mucus blanket forward. The effected down\u2010stroke lasts a third to a fourth of the length of the beat cycle and moves at that stage with a speed of 1 mm/s. The so\u2010called respiratory cilia on the upper and lower airways are examples of mucus\u2010propelling cilia 1, 2.(2)\nWater\u2010propelling cilia. These have a 9 + 2 structure with dynein arms and are motile. Their length is about 10\u201315 \u00b5m. A ciliated cell has one, two, or many cilia. The cilia on the ependymal lining of the brain ventricles and those in the efferent ducts of the testis or in the oviduct are of this type.(3)\nNodal cilia. These have a 9 + 0 structure with dynein arms and are motile. They are short, about 5 \u00b5m in length. There is only one cilium per cell and it moves with a vortical beating pattern, \u2018like a propeller\u2019 3. They emerge and are active in the 7.5\u2010day post\u2010coitum embryo.(4)\nMonocilia. These have a 9 + 2 or a 9 + 0 structure, sometimes with dynein arms. They extend singly from the apex of a cell. In some cases, they appear on a cell that some days later will grow a number of mucus\u2010propelling cilia, as in the trachea 4, or grow water\u2010propelling cilia, as in the urethra 5; they are then called primary cilia. In other cases, they are constant features; the thyroid gland has cells with monocilia that extend into the follicles and that have been hypothesized to stir the colloid in the thyroid follicle 6. Another epithelium with monociliated cells is the corneal endothelium 7. Another name for them is \u2018solitary cilia\u2019.(5)\nRudimentary cilia. These have a 9 + 0 structure without dynein arms and a length usually of about 2 or 3 \u00b5m. It is unlikely that they possess motility, also because they are often found cramped in solid tissues with no space for any movements. It is surprising to find single rudimentary cilia in the neurons and glia cells 8, chondrocytes 9, fibroblasts 10, etc. It has been suggested that their function is to move the centriole/basal body away from the central cytoplasm and thereby prevent the cell from dividing. Alternatively, they carry some receptor or they have no function.(6)\nOlfactory cilia. These have a short basal portion (about 1.5 \u00b5m) with a 9 + 2 structure, probably without dynein arms, and a long distal portion (maybe 50 \u00b5m) with only a few microtubular singlets 11. There are about 20 olfactory cilia on the apical portion of the olfactory cell. The olfactory cilia carry odour receptors in their cell membrane.(7)\nPhotoreceptor cilia. These have a 9 + 0 structure without dynein arms and form a \u2018connecting cilium\u2019 between the inner and the outer rod segment (or between the inner and outer cone segments) and its continuation in the outer segment of the visual cell 12. The outer segment contains membrane disks with visual pigments.(8)\nSperm flagellum. The sperm tail has a 45 \u00b5m long cilium with dynein arms. It moves by a meandering movement, a flagellar motility that differs from that of a cilium.\n",

With two\u2010dimensional chromatography, the 9 + 2 axoneme can be seen to consist of hundreds of polypeptide species 14. The number of essential genes that specify a healthy cilium may hence also be in the hundreds.

The disease was named \u2018immotile\u2010cilia syndrome\u2019 19. Not surprisingly, the patients had chronic or recurrent rhinitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, and in younger days also otitis\u2014thus, illness in organs with mucus\u2010transporting, ciliated epithelia.

Some persons were found to have immotile cilia; others had motile ones, although with a motility that was of insufficient strength or co\u2010ordination to be able to transport the mucus blanket in the normal fashion. The name \u2018primary ciliary dyskinesia\u2019, abbreviated PCD, was proposed for the syndrome. In a third category of people, no cilia were found at all and neither the term immotile\u2010cilia syndrome nor primary ciliary dyskinesia seemed suitable. For such cases, the term \u2018acilia syndrome\u2019 or \u2018ciliary aplasia\u2019 was suggested. It is, however, inconvenient to have separate names for each subgroup of the disease and the original term will be used. Thus, immotile\u2010cilia syndrome is considered here to be a group of diseases in which the respiratory cilia are immotile, dysmotile, or altogether missing.",

This will enhance the contrast in the resulting electron micrographs and make diagnosis easier (Figure 2).

In their method, they take a brush biopsy from the inferior concha of the nose and transfer it to a tissue culture vessel in which the medium is supplemented with pronase to make the individual cells separate from the epithelium and also supplemented with antibiotics to eliminate any bacterial growth. After about 1 day, the cilia are shed and after several more days, new cilia emerge.

In a paper from 1998, Nonaka et al\n3 showed that the 7.5 post\u2010coitum mouse embryo indeed carries cilia with the function to determine the sidedness of the forming heart and that these cilia are located in the closing neural tube; they were named nodal cilia. The nodal cilia create a leftward stream over the node of a fluid that presumably contains a morphogenic factor, which specifies the location of the forming heart. In mutants of mice, which lack such nodal cilia, the heart will be formed at the left or right side in equal proportion. In a second, important paper, Nonaka et al showed that the positioning of the heart can be determined at will by applying a motor\u2010driven stream of the extra\u2010embryonic fluid over the node 28. An \u2018inheritance of randomness\u2019 is a rare but not unique phenomenon; it also acts in the left\u2010 or right\u2010handedness 29, 30.",

Of the 17 women in Sweden with immotile\u2010cilia syndrome whom I have asked about their success or failure to become pregnant and who claim to have tried to become mothers for a minimum of 3 years, eight have children and nine have been unable to become pregnant. Hence female fertility is somewhat reduced when the cilia are immotile, dysmotile or missing, a fact that is not surprising considering the fact that the oviducts are ciliated and that egg transport is generally believed to be performed at least partially by these cilia.",

The cilia may thus become immotile, dysmotile, be shed from the cell, or they may become flaccid, matted, clumped together, or harmed in numerous other ways. It is difficult to decide, from an inspection of the cilia by light microscopy or electron microscopy, whether a certain biopsy of the respiratory epithelium shows cilia with primary or secondary immotility, dyskinesia, or loss.

As a consequence hereof, there are no cilia to prevent particular matter from settling down on the ependymal surface 84. The epithelial lining of the aqueduct is therefore destroyed and in nature's attempt to heal the breach, glial cells will cover the aqueduct, which results in stenosis and, as a consequence hereof, in ventricular enlargements and in hydrocephalus.
