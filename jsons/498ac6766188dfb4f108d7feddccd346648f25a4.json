Whereas there remains the question of how we can protect ourselves from being infected while helping others by donating resources in fighting against the epidemic. To answer the question, we propose a novel resource allocation model by considering the awareness of self-protection of individuals. In the model, a tuning parameter is introduced to quantify the reaction strength of individuals when they are aware of the disease. And then, a coupled model of resource allocation and disease spreading is proposed to study the impact of self-awareness on resource allocation and, its impact on the dynamics of epidemic spreading. Through theoretical analysis and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we find that in the stationary state, the system converges to two states: the whole healthy or the completely infected, which indicates an abrupt increase in the prevalence when there is a shortage of resources. More importantly, we find that too cautious and too selfless for the people during the outbreak of an epidemic are both not suitable for disease control. Through extensive simulations, we find the optimal point, at which there is a maximum value of the epidemic threshold, and an outbreak can be delayed to the greatest extent. At last, we study further the effects of network structure on the coupled dynamics. We find that the degree heterogeneity promotes the outbreak of disease, and the network structure does not alter the optimal phenomenon in behavior response.",

During the past decades, the onset of several major global health threats such as the 2003 spread of SARS, the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, and the western Africa Ebola outbreaks in 2014 have deprived tens of thousands of lives all around the world [1] [2] [3] . In the present, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing severe acute respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, China. As of February 4, 2020, there have been 20528 confirmed 2019-nCoV infections reported in 33 provinces and municipalities [4] . The surge in infections has led to a severe shortage of medical resources. Thousands of confirmed and suspected cases await treatment. Facing the rapid outbreak of disease, people all over the country contribute a resource to support the populations in the epidemic areas, whereas self-protection is also essential. Thus the immediate problem is how can we protect ourselves from being infected while helping others in fighting against the epidemic.",

They fond the costoptimal distribution of vaccination resource when different levels of vaccination are allowed through a convex framework. Further they studied problems of the optimal allocation of two typical resources in containing epidemic spreading, namely the preventive resources and corrective resources throughout the nodes of the network to achieve the highest level of containment when the budget is given in advance or finding the minimum budget required to control the spreading the process when the budget is not specified [11] . By using geometric programming, they solved these two problems. Chen et al. [12] solved the problem of optimal allocation of a limited medical resource based on mean-field theory. They found that if the resource quantity that each node could get is proportional to its degree, the disease can be suppressed to the greatest extent. The above works considered the problem from a perspective of mathematical. The problem is solved from the premise that both the number of resources and the spreading state of the epidemic are fixed.",

For example, although, the outbreak of 2019-nCoV induce a severe shortage of food, medical and defense resources such as surgical mask and disinfectant within a short time, with more and more resources produced by the healthy people, and the social-support from home and abroad, the situation is beginning to ease in Wuhan.

Namely, how awareness influences individual behavior during the outbreak of disease. The more interesting question is, how individuals will decide whether to allocate their resources after perceiving the local transmission state. To answer these questions, a novel resource allocation model is proposed in this paper, which considers the influence of the awareness of each individual. We consider that healthy individuals in an outbreak of disease are the source of various resources, they can not only produce a medical resource such as drugs, surgical mask but also donate a resource such as funds and food. Whereas when they perceive the threat of disease in the local area, they would decide whether to donate resources to infected neighbors. Since the donation behavior will lead to less resource for self-protection, and a more significant probability to be infected. Whereas, when they are aware of the threat of the disease and refuse to donate resources, they will have more resources for self-protection and a lower probability of being infected. Moreover, to study the interplay between the resource allocation and disease spreading, we propose a cou-pled dynamical model on complex networks.",

First of all, we investigate the influence of awareness on the coupled dynamics of resource allocation and disease spreading on the scale-free network. To quantify the reaction strength of healthy individuals to the information of the local infection state, a parameter \u03b1 is defined. A larger value of \u03b1 indicates more sensitivity of an individual to the disease, and lower intention to denote resources. Through theoretical analysis and numeric simulations, we find that the system has only two stationary states, namely the absorb state and the globe outbreak state. With the increase of \u03b1, the epidemic threshold first increases and then decreases, which indicates an optimal value of \u03b1. Further, we find the optimal value at \u03b1 opt through extensive simulations, at which the disease can be suppressed to the greatest extent. Then we explain qualitatively the optimal phenomenon. At last, we investigate the impact of degree heterogeneity on the coupled dynamics, and find that the degree heterogeneity does not alter the optimal phenomenon and the abrupt increase in prevalence with a shortage of resource, and the epidemic threshold increases with the decrease of degree heterogeneity, which suggests that network heterogeneity promotes the outbreak of disease.",

Individuals are represented by nodes in the network and an adjacency matrix A is introduced to represent the connection between nodes. If there is an edge between nodes i and j, the element a ij = 1, otherwise a ij = 0. According to this scheme, any individual can be in two different states: susceptible(S) and infected(I). The infection propagates between each pair of I-state and S-state neighbors with an infection rate \u03bb in one contact, which is assumed to depend on whether the S-state nodes to donate resources, see the details in Sec. II B. At any time t, each I-state node i recovers with a recovery rate r i (t). Resource including the medical, funds and food can promote recovery of patients from disease [23, 24] . Thus we define the recovery rate of each I-state node as a function of the resource quantity received from healthy neighbors in this paper. As each I-state node will get a different amount of resource, the recovery rate varies from node to node. Consequently, the the recovery rate of any node i at time t can be defined as",

Without loss of generality, we set \u00b5 r = 0.6 throughout this work, i.e., only 60% of the resources received are used.

In the simulation, the synchronous updating method [36, 37] is applied to the disease infection and resource allocation processes. Within each time increment \u2206t, where \u2206t = 1 in this paper, infection propagates from any I-state node j to S-state node i with probability \u03bb i \u2206t, and any I-state node j recovers to S-state with a probability r j \u2206t. With the spreading of disease, the resource allocation process co-occurs. The dynamics terminate once it enters a steady state in which the number of infected nodes only fluctuates within a small range. Note that, we fix the factor c at a constant value c = 0.05 throughout the paper, such that if any healthy individual j chooses to reserve its resource, the probability that it is infected in one contact with an infected neighbor reduces to \u03bb j = 0.05\u03bb.",

To build the network, we adopt the uncorrelated configuration model(UCM) [42, 43] according to a given degree distribution P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 with maximum degree k max = \u221a N [44] and minimum degree k min = 3, which assures no degree correlation of the network when N is sufficient large.

We first investigate the effects of behavior response on the spreading dynamics using Monte Carlo simulations. Initially, a fraction of \u03c1(0) = 0.1 nodes are selected randomly as seeds, the remain nodes are in susceptible state. To present different reaction strength of individuals when they are aware of a certain disease from local information, we select eight typical values of \u03b1 from \u03b1 = 0.1 to \u03b1 = 0.9 in the simulation. In Figs. 1 (a) and (c), we plot the prevalence \u03c1 in the stationary state as a function of basic infection rate \u03bb for different \u03b1. Symbols in Figs. 1 (a) and (c) represent the results obtained by Monte Carlo simulations and lines are the theoretical results obtained from numeric iterations, respectively. From the curves Figs. 1(a) and (c), we observe that the system converges to two possible stationary states: either the whole population is healthy, or it becomes completely infected for any \u03b1, which tells us that when there is a shortage in resource, the disease will break out abruptly. Besides we can observe from Figs. 1(a) and (b) that with the increase of \u03b1 from \u03b1 = 0.1 to \u03b1 = 0.5, the epidemic threshold increases gradually, see the peaks of \u03c7 for the corresponding \u03b1. It reveals that the stronger the individual's sense of self-protection, the more delayed the outbreak of the disease within this parameter interval (see the right arrow). On the contrary, we observe from Figs. 1(c) and (d) that when \u03b1 increases from \u03b1 = 0.6 to \u03b1 = 0.9, the threshold decreases gradually, which reveals that the disease breaks out more easily with a stronger sense of self-protection within this parameter interval (see the left arrow). The phenomenon suggests that too cautious or too selfless for the people during the outbreak of an epidemic are both not suitable for disease control, and there is an optimal value of the reaction strength, at which an epidemic outbreak will be postponed to the greatest extent.",

Colors in Fig. 2 (a) encode the fraction of infected nodes in the stationary state \u03c1. The epidemic threshold \u03bb c , marked by red circles, rises monotonically until it reaches the maximum at \u03b1 opt (indicated by the blue dotted line), and then falls gradually with the increase of \u03b1. Besides, we observe that there are only two possible stationary state: the whole healthy (marked by blue color) and the whole infected of the population (marked by yellow color), Fig. 3 (a) plots the time evolution of \u03c1(t) for six typical values of \u03b1 when the basic infection rate is fixed at \u03bb = 0.04. We find that when the value of \u03b1 is small, the system to converge to a stationary state rapidly, such as \u03c1(\u221e) = 1.0 for \u03b1 = 0.1. With the increase of \u03b1, it takes a longer time for the system to reach a stationary state. Further, to exhibit the effects of \u03b1 on the dynamics more intuitively, we plot the fraction of Fig. 3 (b) , which is denoted as \u03c1(\u03b1) for the sake of clarity.

We observe in Fig. 4 that in the initial stage, the donation probability for \u03b1 = 0.1 is the highest [see the blue line in the top panel of Fig. 4 (a) ], since a smaller value of \u03b1 means a higher willingness of healthy individuals to allocate resources. Although the resource of healthy individuals can improve the recovery probability of infected neighbors to a certain extent, it also makes themselves more likely to be infected. We can observe in Figs. 4 (b) and (c) that, the average recovery rate r and infection rate \u03bb is highest for \u03b1 = 0.1, meanwhile, there is a lowest value of effective infection rate \u03bb / r , as shown in Fig. 4 (d) . However, as the high probability of being infected for the healthy nodes, the number of infected individuals increases at a high rate [see the blue line in the bottom pane of Fig. 4 (a) ]. When people are aware of the increment of the infected neighbors, they will reduce their donation willingness, which leads to a reduction in infection rate \u03bb , as shown in Figs. 4 (a) and (b) . Consequently, with less resource received from healthy neighbors, the recovery rate of infected nodes reduces accordingly, see Fig. 4 (c) , which leads to an increase of the effective infection rate \u03bb / r [14] . The increase in \u03bb / r has led to a further increase in the number of infected nodes. Then people become more aware of the threat of disease, and thus reduce the probability of resource donation further, which leads to a further decrease in infection rate \u03bb and recovery rate r and finally, the increase of the effective infection rate \u03bb / r . Specifically, we observe from Fig. 4 (d) that, when it surpasses a critical time t * , indicated by the dotted line in the figure, the value of \u03bb / r proliferates, which suggests that in this stage the infection of healthy individuals is much faster than the recovery of infected individuals. With more newly infected nodes, the donation probability q and infection rate \u03bb decreases further, which results in less resources donated to support the recovery of infected nodes. Thus the recovery rate of infected nodes r drops abruptly, which in turn promotes the increases of effective infection rate \u03bb / r further, and then more and number of infected nodes appear. Consequently, the cascading failure of the entire system occurs.",

Consequently, the infected nodes will receive the lowest value of the resource to recover, which leading to the smallest value of recovery rate r , as shown the green stars in of Fig. 4 (c) . Then the recovery of infected nodes is delayed leading to a high effective infection rate. We can observe in Fig. 4 (d) that, when \u03b1 = 0.9, there is a highest value of \u03bb / r . The high effective infection rate will lead to a rapid increase in the number of infected nodes. We can observe in the bottom pane of Fig. 4 (a) that, in the early stage, there is a second largest value of m for \u03b1 = 0.9, as denoted by the green stars. The large value of m will further, reduce the willingness of resource donation for the healthy individuals, thus we can observe a continuous decline in q and \u03bb . What's worse, the recovery rate of infected nodes keeps declining with less and less resource [see Fig. 4 (c) ], which leading to a rapid growth of \u03bb / r [see the curve in Fig. 4 (d) ].",

The lower willingness of resource donation induces to a relatively smaller value of recovery rate r , as shown in Fig. 4 (c) . However, we can observe from Fig. 4 (d) that the effective infection rate \u03bb / r keeps the lowest value in the early stage, which suggests that the disease will propagate slowly in the population, and the number of infected nodes will increase slowly, which is verified by the curve in the bottom pane of Fig. 4 (a) . Further, the small value of m will promotes the increase of q [see the curve in the top pane of Fig. 4 (a) ], which resulting in the increase of recovery rate r .

In addition, we adopt the UCM model to generate scale-free networks with different degree distributions P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 . As the degree heterogeneity decreases with the increase of the power exponent \u03b3 [47, 48] , thus it approaches to random regular networks RRN s when \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e [17] . Fig. 6 plots the prevalence \u03c1 in the stationary state as a function of the basic infection rate \u03b3 for networks with four typical values of \u03b3: \u03b3 = 2.4 (blue circles), \u03b3 = 2.8 (upper triangles), \u03b3 = 3.2 (purple squares) and \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e (red rhombus). We observe that there are only two stationary states of the system: all healthy or completely infected for all networks, which implies that the network structure does not alter the first-order transition of \u03c1. Besides, we find that, with an increase of \u03b3, the outbreak of disease is delayed gradually. It suggests that the degree heterogeneity enhance the disease spreading, which is consistent with the existing research conclusions [49] .",

To answer this question, we propose a novel resource allocation model in controlling the epidemic spreading. We consider that healthy individual can contribute their resources to help those in need, and some will consider self-protection first when they perceive the threat of disease. The others will contribute to resource as much as possible. To quantify the behavior response of individuals, a tune parameter \u03b1 is introduced. Besides, to study the coupled dynamics of resource allocation and disease spreading, a resource-based SIS model is proposed. First of all, we theoretically analyze the model using a generated dynamic message-passing method, and then we carry out extensive Monte Carlo simulations on both scale-free and random regular networks. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we find that the coupled dynamics converges to two stationary states: the whole infected or all healthy, which indicates that a shortage of resource can induce an abrupt outbreak of the epidemic. More importantly, we find that too cautious or too selfless for the people during the outbreak of an epidemic are both not suitable for disease control. There is an optimal (balance) point where the epidemic spreading can be controlled to the greatest extent. It also tells us that we can donate resource appropriately to support the people in need, but at the same time, we should keep some resources for selfprotection. Further, we find out the optimal point on both in certain conditions. At last, we investigate the effects of network structure on the coupled dynamics. We find that the degree heterogeneity promotes the outbreak of disease, and the network structure does not alter the optimal phenomenon in behavior response.",
