Interferons (IFNs) are potent modulators of cell growth and differentiation as well as host immune responses to viral infections (\n2\n,\n3\n). IFNs have historically been used in the treatment of laryngeal papillomas as well as other HPV-associated lesions, often with inconsistent clinical outcomes (\n4\u20136\n). Many viruses have evolved complex immunoevasive strategies and HPVs are no exception (\n7\u201310\n). HPV infection is associated with an altered immunogenic profile of keratinocytes\nin vivo\n(\n11\n,\n12\n) including altered cytokine expression (\n13\n,\n14\n). Cervical lesions undergoing malignant progression\nin vivo\n, as well as human keratinocytes harboring persistently replicating HPV plasmid genomes, exhibit compromised immunoreactive cellular pathways such as decreased expression of IFNs and IFN-dependent pathways (\n15\n,\n16\n). Decreases in IFN-inducible factors such as signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)-1 (\n17\u201319\n) and viral infection-induced interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 (\n20\n) have also been documented. A previous study described IRF-1 binding to the HPV-16 major early promoter (\n21\n) and E7 proteins from mucosal or cutaneous HPVs were shown to directly inhibit the function of IRF-9 (p48) (\n22\n) and IRF-1 (\n23\u201325\n).\n",

Members of the IRF family of factors have been shown to be essential for cellular differentiation and proliferation as well as host response to viral infection (reviewed in ref.\n27\n). Loss of IRF-1 (a putative tumor suppressor protein), for example, has been shown to be an important step for oncogene-induced transformation and apoptosis (\n28\n,\n29\n) and has also been detected in a variety of human leukemias and preleukemic myelodysplasias (\n30\n). IFNs have also been shown to modulate viral replication in non-HPV viruses (\n31\n,\n32\n). In HPV, recent studies have shown that high doses of IFN reduce viral plasmid load while selecting for latent integrated HPV genomes in explant-derived HPV-16-positive cervical keratinocytes (\n33\n,\n34\n).\n",

Oligonucleotides spanning this putative IRE in the HPV-16 P97 promoter were constructed to detect the binding of IRFs in mobility shift assays (\nFigure 1B\n). Nucleotide substitutions designed to disrupt the binding of these factors were introduced into the homology shared by several mucosal HPV E6\u2013E7 promoters, including HPV-31 (another high-risk HPV type) and HPV-11 (a \u2018low risk\u2019 type). A complex specifically formed between keratinocyte extracts or purified recombinant proteins and the putative HPV-16 IRE. The composite keratinocyte complex was identified as IRF-1 and IRF-2 by binding specificity, complex mobility and antigenicity (\nFigure 1B\n, lanes 5\u20138). In contrast to most other cell lineages, the ratio of constitutive binding of endogenous IRF-1 and IRF-2 to the P97 promoter of HPV-16 genomes was distinct in keratinocytes as demonstrated in transfected SCC13 cells using chromatin immunoprecipitations quantified by competitive PCR (\nFigure 1C\n, lanes 5 and 6). These results were consistent with\nin vitro\nmobility shift assays with keratinocyte extracts which also demonstrated a higher ratio of IRF-1 to IRF-2 binding (\nFigure 1B\n) in these cells even though rIRF-1 and rIRF-2 exhibited identical dissociation constants (\nKd\n), ranging from 0.3 to 20 nM in parallel (\nTable I\n). We expanded this analysis to include multiple additional mucosal HPV types, demonstrating for the first time that IRF-1 and IRF-2 binding is a conserved feature among eight additional major early promoters in HPV types 6, 13, 31, 33, 35, 52, 56 and 72 (\nTable I\n).\n",

We first monitored the formation of IFN-inducible complexes: Stat-1, IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 and IRF-1, using their cognate binding sequences (\nFigure 1A\n) and IFN-treated keratinocyte extracts in mobility shift assays (\nFigure 2A\n). All three complexes formed with control sequences immediately following IFN treatment but only constitutive IRF-2 and IFN-induced IRF-1 binding to the HPV-16 IRE was detected. Rather than relying on sequence analysis to identify IFN-responsive\ncis\nelements in HPV-16, we performed mobility shift assays, as described above, using an array of overlapping synthetic oligonucleotides spanning the entire 1 kb upstream regulatory region. Interestingly, no Stat-1 or IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 binding was detected in the HPV-16 IRE or elsewhere in the major early promoter of HPV-16 (M.J.Lace, T.H.Haugen and L.P.Turek, unpublished data). We also monitored the transcription of Stat-responsive and IRF-responsive cellular promoters, pIRF-1 and pIRF-2, respectively, in primary HFK in RNase protection assays following IFN treatment (\nFigure 2B\n). We found that IFN-\u03b2 activates the expression of both IRF-1- and Stat-1-responsive targets\nin vivo\n. Taken together, these results confirm that critical IFN-mediated IRF and Stat pathways are intact and functional in primary keratinocytes, the natural host cells for HPV infection.\n",

However, IFNs are pleiotropic mediators capable of activating multiple cellular pathways\nin vivo\n. In contrast to previous studies, we utilized IRF knockout cell lines to resolve the complex interplay of IFN-dependent signaling pathways and define their effects on critical initial events influencing HPV persistence. These critical assays enabled us to identify the specific pathway responsible for the observed IFN-dependent HPV transcription phenotypes. The IFN-mediated stimulation of early HPV gene transcription was solely dependent on the induction of the IRF-1 pathway, presumably through initial phosphorylation of extant levels of the IRF-1 protein and supported by increased Stat-dependent IRF-1 expression. The transient nature of IRF-1-dependent effects following IFN treatment can be explained by limited IRF-1 messenger RNA and/or protein stability coupled with the eventual increase in IRF-2 expression that could competitively displace IRF-1 from its shared cognate binding motif to function as a DNA-binding repressor of IFN-responsive targets (\n53\n). The transient IFN-dependent induction of HPV early gene transcription and IRF expression observed in this study is consistent with the kinetics of this mechanism. Transient HPV induction is also consistent with a strategy of tightly regulated viral gene expression and genome amplification that would limit cellular responses to viral infection potentially triggered by unrestricted viral replication or elevated levels of viral gene products.\n",

As the IFN-mediated loss of plasmid copy number appears to be independent of the IRF pathway (this study), it probably competes with cytokine-dependent induction of plasmid replication\nin vivo\nto stabilize a homeostatic viral load in persistently infected keratinocytes. Therefore, when the IRE-dependent induction pathway is disabled, a significant decrease in overall plasmid replication and concomitant HPV copy number is revealed. At higher IFN doses, this alternate pathway appears to be kinetically dominant, resulting in a rapid loss of viral plasmids. This as yet undefined mechanism of HPV plasmid attenuation may account for partial clearance of HPV load following high therapeutic doses of IFN. However, following high-dose IFN treatment, any residual viral genomes could be restimulated after physiologic levels of IFN are restored, potentially resulting in a renewed cycle of HPV persistence and malignant progression.\n",
