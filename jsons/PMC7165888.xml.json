            "text": "Multiple lines of evidence (LOEs) are commonly used to assess the impact of sediment contamination on benthic organisms in North America and worldwide (Long et al. 2006). Typical LOEs include bulk sediment chemistry, toxicity tests, bioaccumulation tests, and benthic community composition (Chapman and Anderson 2005). Within the LOE approach, numerical sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) are used as screening tools to assist in interpreting sediment chemistry data (Long et al. 2006; Ritter et al. 2011). By using multiple LOEs, a weight of evidence (WOE) assessment of site contamination can be useful for a complete understanding of sediment contaminant impacts. Although SQGs are typically assigned according to jurisdictions, interjurisdictional SQGs exhibit wide ranges of chemical concentrations that can span 2 to 3 orders of magnitude in their predicted dose\u2013response for a given chemical (MacDonald et al. 2000). SQGs are most commonly developed and assessed using standardized sediment toxicity assays (e.g., amphipod toxicity, Microtox\u00ae bioluminescence, sea urchin fertilization tests) that are meant to serve as surrogates for actual benthic species (Wenning et al. 2005). Given that these tests are carried out under controlled laboratory conditions, it is difficult to determine how accurately the SQGs can predict toxicity under more complex field conditions, which include a diversity of environmental (e.g., site\u2010specific differences in chemical bioavailability) and ecological attributes as well as complex chemical mixture effects (Chapman 1996; Bay and Weisberg 2010). Given that the purpose of SQGs is to provide a screening level assessment of in situ toxicity, it is imperative that attempts at field assessment of SQGs be carried out on a regular basis and cover multiple environment types (Ritter et al. 2011; Bay et al. 2012).",

            "text": "To establish a proper methodology for the field assessment of a set of SQGs, both environment (habitat) and chemical mixture interactions need to be taken into consideration. The effect of chemical exposures on zoobenthic communities can be obscured by the overriding habitat\u2010specificity of many aquatic invertebrates, especially in lotic systems (Wright 1995; Parsons and Norris 1996; Reynoldson et al. 1997, 2001). For example, in a review of SQGs, Long et al. (2006) indicated the need for increased understanding of habitat\u2010specific local features such as particle size, depth, and velocity in addition to chemical\u2010specific stressors on the benthic community. Habitat classification is more commonly considered in surveys designed to assess benthic community structure such as with the reference condition approach (RCA). These approaches provide a multivariate means of matching habitat attributes in a sample test location against a library of reference sites before evaluating for differences in benthic community composition at the test location (Wright 1995; Parsons and Norris 1996; Reynoldson et al. 1997). Presumably, comparable approaches to habitat\u2010matching could be adopted under a field SQG assessment, although the use of such a strategy seems to be uncommon. In such a case, dose\u2013response relationships in the numerical presence of a habitat\u2010appropriate indicator species or community composition can be evaluated across a gradient of chemical contamination measured within a given habitat type. Applying such a methodology for field SQG assessment may also have the advantage of being able to examine for differences in the performance of SQGs between habitat types and in the identification of site\u2010specific indicator species.",

            "text": "A second complication related to field assessment of SQGs involves the ability to define contamination gradients because of chemical mixture effects arising from differences in the sources and environmental distribution of individual chemicals. These chemical\u2010specific differences can lead to disparate patterns in contamination where presumably \u201cclean\u201d conditions for one chemical of study may be highly degraded for another. There exist several hazard quotient approaches currently available that combine SQGs and site\u2010specific contaminant measurements for multiple chemicals to compute a single toxicity score. However, all toxicity score computation methods incorporate sets of assumptions that can introduce anomalies that bias toxicity assessment toward over\u2010 or underestimation of the actual site\u2010specific toxicity. For example, most studies adopting a hazard quotient approach consider deviations in site\u2010specific chemical residues with SQGs attributed to high biological impact (e.g., the severe effect concentration [SEC] or probable effect concentration [PEC]) but ignore SQGs for the same chemicals that are associated with more conservative estimates of toxicity (e.g., threshold effect concentration [TEC] or low effect concentration [LEC]). Thus, hazard quotient approaches, by default, assume a linear dose\u2013response relationship that is based on one calibration point even though toxicity related to animal mortality often takes on a sigmoidal distribution that necessitate multiple calibration points (MacDonald et al. 2000; Ritter et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Similarly, toxicity score metrics differ in their computation schemes that make the method more or less sensitive to the number of chemicals included and/or diversity of chemical signatures generated in a given survey. For example, different toxicity score metrics consider the sum, average, or weighted average hazard quotients for sets of priority contaminants. Toxicity scores generated as the sum of hazard quotients can be biased to overpredicting toxicity when many chemicals are included in the metric even when all of the chemicals are below the SQGs at a given location. Metrics generated by an average hazard quotient approach can lead to underestimates of toxicity when several chemicals have very low site\u2010specific concentrations. These low concentration chemicals can effectively dilute the toxicity score value even when 1 or more contaminant concentrations exceed their SQGs for high biological impact. One of the objectives of this study was to introduce an alternative toxicity score metric, henceforth identified as the hazard score (HZD) metric, which assumes a sigmoidal toxicity distribution, adopts a multipoint calibration scheme based on existing SQGs, and establishes a threshold effect concentration, below which chemicals included in the metric have no influence on the summed toxicity score. This new toxicity metric is then compared with more classic multi\u2010chemical hazard quotient (designated as PEC\u2010quotient or PEC\u2010Q) approaches to determine, which metric if any, provides the best prediction of field toxicity as evaluated using field assessment data.",

First, a habitat classification scheme was developed that used a multivariate approach to designate distinct sediment habitat types within the Detroit River survey locations using habitat variables previously described as being important to benthic community structure. Following this, the benthic community database was used to identify potential benthic invertebrate indicators within each habitat type by choosing organisms that demonstrated high association, high abundance (but also high variation in abundance) across sample locations of a given habitat. The relative abundance of each benthic invertebrate indicator was then used as a surrogate measure of \u201cfield toxicity\u201d and compared with the different SQG\u2010based toxicity score metrics. In addition, a multi\u2010metric IBI was developed for each unique habitat type of the Detroit River according to the methods described by Reynoldson et al. (1997). The habitat\u2010specific IBIs were also contrasted with each of the SQG\u2010based toxicity scores to determine which, if any, showed the strongest correlations. This permitted a set of independent contrasts between different chemical mixture assessment approaches (SQG\u2010based toxicity scores), indicator species abundance, and multimetric community composition changes.",

The sample collection protocol for the current study has been described previously by Drouillard et al. (2006). Briefly, 150 sampling sites were identified based on a stratified random design within 3 reaches (upper, middle, and lower) of the Detroit River (Figure 1). Surface sediments were collected using a petite Ponar grab sampler, whereupon multiple grabs were used to provide a standardized total volume of 2 L of sediment. Water depth was measured on site. Bottom water velocity was estimated from a previously developed 3D hydrological model (Reitsma et al. 2003). Sediment samples were analyzed for physical (TOC, silt, sand, and gravel), chemical (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Hg, Ni, Zn, hexachlorobenzene [HCB], DDE, total PCBs, and total PAHs) and benthic community data (Table 1). Complete physicochemical analytical methods are described by Drouillard et al. (2006) and Szalinska et al. (2006). A second 2 L sediment sample from each sample location was collected by similar methods. Samples were coarsely sieved (600 \u03bcm) at the sampling location to remove most of the fine materials, and the contents of the sieve bucket were emptied into a plastic bag and preserved with Kahle's solution. At the laboratory, zoobenthos were sorted and identified to common lowest taxonomic ranks under a dissecting scope and stored in glass vials containing 80% ethanol. For quality assurance, 10% of samples were resorted and compared with the previous assessment. Overall, resamples agreed with originals within 4% error.",

The first 2 components of the PCA were found to cumulatively explain 78.5% of the variation in the data (Table S2). Depth, velocity and gravel were strongly associated with the PC1 axis, and TOC, sand, and silt were associated with the PC2 axis. No variables showed strong associations with PCA axes 3, 4, and 5 and given that these axes contributed limited amounts to the variation in the data, they were ignored in habitat characterization. After examining the clustering of sites across the first 2 PCA axes, 4 main habitat types were identified consisting of silt (Silt), low velocity sand (LSand), high velocity sand (HSand), and gravel (Grav) (Figure 2A). Initially, stations were clustered into the habitat types by manually drawing ellipses around similarly ordinated stations as defined by their scores on the PC1 and PC2 axes. DFA was subsequently used to test the assignment of habitat type for each station into the 4 major habitat types. Initial DFA indicated 85% of sites were correctly classified within the user\u2010identified habitats. After reclassification of improperly classified sites, a second DFA indicated 95% of sites were correctly identified (Table S3). All sites identified by habitat via DFA were used for further analysis (Figure 2B). Among the 136 stations included in the analysis, 124 stations could be assigned to a habitat type with a 95% confidence. The remaining stations, of unknown or mixed habitat association, were censored from further analysis. Each of the Silt, LSand, HSand, and Grav habitats had 33, 45, 28, and 18 total sites, respectively. Generally, habitats were distributed as expected, with the gravel and/or high flow sand areas found within the upper reach and silt/low flow sand areas generally within the lower reach or near depositional zones of islands (Figure 1).",

In addition, the slope of the regression line (m = 0.51) more closely fit the 1:1 expectation indicating that it is had lower bias compared to the 3 PEC\u2010Q methods. For the PEC\u2010Q approaches, the PEC\u2010Qavg was generally too conservative. Several sites generated low toxicity predictions but also contained very low abundance or a complete absence of the benthic indicator. The PEC\u2010Qsum was overly sensitive with several sites predicted to have 100% toxicity whereas field abundance of chironomids were relatively high. For the IBI values, the PEC\u2010Qavg and PEC\u2010Qmet resulted in significant negative correlations of R\n2 = 0.316 (p = 0.000) and R\n2 = 0.323 (p = 0.000), respectively, with the HZD metric of R\n2 = 0.101 significant at the p < 0.1 level (p = 0.071). Unlike the Chironomidae abundance, there is no expected 1:1 relationship between the SQG scores and IBI values, thus the proximity of the slope to a value of 1 provides no guidance to evaluating goodness\u2010of\u2010fit tests. Overall, both the Chironomidae abundance (field toxicity) and IBI approaches showed reasonable correlations with the HZD, PEC\u2010Qavg, and PEC\u2010Qmet SQG scoring metrics. Thus, within the Silt habitat type, SQG\u2010based toxicity scores are successful at predicting biological impact using either an indicator species or multimetric community composition (IBI) approach.

Again PEC\u2010Qavg and PEC\u2010Qmet were found to be overly conservative and predicted low toxicity despite numerous sites with 100% field toxicity. The HZD approach yielded a goodness\u2010of\u2010fit slope of 0.65 and most closely approximated the 1:1 correlation between predicted and field toxicity values. However, this metric also tended to under predict toxicity at many sites. The PEC\u2010Qsum yielded a goodness\u2010of\u2010fit test slope of 0.39, lower than HZD but this was largely due to higher toxicity prediction at a few of the low contamination sites.

This is consistent with higher organic carbon content in Silt contributing to a higher degree of chemical sequestering and lower overall contaminant bioavailability. However, these differences may also be a product of an oversimplification of the habitat classification method. Although the selection of variables included in the habitat model were demonstrated to be relevant habitat predictors within the literature, benthic invertebrates within the study system may track habitats at a finer scale then what classification would model would suggest and errors in true habitat classification would contribute to additional variation in the goodness\u2010of\u2010fit test.

Averaging hazard quotients across chemicals (PEC\u2010Qavg) results in conservative toxicity estimates, particularly when several chemicals are found in sediments at low concentrations relative to their PEC\u2010Q values. Thus, averaging causes \u201cdilution\u201d of the overall score and consistently produces the lowest toxicity prediction. For the Chironomidae indicator in Silt and LSand, the PEC\u2010Qavg was the poorest predictor of indicator abundance. Alternatively, PEC\u2010Qsum can result in overly sensitive predictions of toxicity when several chemicals are present at low concentrations. In this case, the likelihood of exceeding an effect criterion, even when no field toxicity occurs, increases as the number of chemicals added to the metric increases. PEC\u2010Qsum overestimated Chironomidae toxicity in Silt habitats but provided the second best prediction of indicator abundances in the LSand habitat where indicator sensitivity to contamination was apparently higher. Both the PEC\u2010Qavg and PEC\u2010Qsum could be improved by adopting the TEC\u2010censoring algorithm used within the HZD methodology. Censoring chemicals that are present in sediments at concentrations less than the TEC value would increase the overall score for PEC\u2010Qavg and decrease that of PEC\u2010Qsum. However, the dilution artifact introduced by PEC\u2010Qavg\u00ad can still present problems especially under the extreme case where only a single contaminant is present at high enough concentrations to elicit strong toxicological response. The PEC\u2010Qmet provides an intermediate toxicity prediction given that metals are treated as a single contaminant whereas variations in organic chemical scores are given more weight in the algorithm. The PEC\u2010Qmet is expected to be more appropriate when organic contaminants contribute to a larger proportion of sediment toxicity. It was the second best predictor of chironomid abundances in the Silt habitat and 3rd best predictor in LSand habitats whereas this metric was the strongest predictor of IBI in Silt but poorest predictor in LSand. PEC\u2010Qmet could also benefit from adopting the TEC censoring method.",

Figure S6 contrasts % toxicity predicted for a single contaminant (PCBs) over a theoretical range of sediment concentrations using HZD (Eqn. 6 and the TEC censoring algorithm) and PEC\u2010QPCB. As demonstrated by the figure, HZD generates a lower toxicity estimate compared to PEC\u2010QPCB when sediment concentrations of PCBs are between the TEC and PEC value and a higher estimate of toxicity for sediment concentrations exceeding PEC up to the 93% toxicity estimate where both toxicity curves intersect and eventually become maximized at 100% toxicity. When applied on a multichemical basis, HZD will therefore tend to produce lower toxicity estimates when several chemicals are less than PEC and higher toxicity estimates when multiple chemicals exceed their respective PEC.

However, the value of toxicity associated with the PEC concentration can be set to other toxicity values and potentially optimized to establish a best fit to a calibration data set. Preliminary trials were carried out using the HZD score by adjustment of PEC toxicity equivalents in the range of 25% to 75%. However, these adjustments were not found to make substantial improvements in goodness to fit test outcomes for chironomid abundances in this system. Furthermore, given the differences in sensitivity of chironomids to sediment contamination between habitats it is clear than no single optimized value is likely to work across all environments nor would this be applicable to other types of benthic indicator species.",

Thus, for Silt\u2010type habitats, stations having a computed HZD score greater than 54.1% might be considered potentially toxic with respect to chironomid abundances, whereas in LSand environments, a lower HZD score of 32.3% or greater might be considered potentially toxic. Table 4 also presents SQG\u2010based toxicity metric scores that correspond to the median IBI scores achieved in these 2 habitat types. In this case, a HZD score of 65.2% and 50.6% will generate a median IBI scored for each respective habitat type. Such information could prove useful for setting site and habitat\u2010specific criteria or remediation goals using a multichemical metric approach. Thus, in Silt, HZD scores exceeding 50% are more likely to be considered toxic both from an indicator abundance perspective as well as have a higher likelihood of achieving lower IBI scores. In LSand habitats, HAZ scores exceeding 30% may be useful for designating the potential for biological impacts. Table 4 also summarizes the score values for 50% chironomid toxicity and scores that achieve the median IBI in Silt and LSand for PEC\u2010Qavg, PEC\u2010Qmet, and PEC\u2010Qsum metrics. In the case of PEC\u2010Qavg, the degraded condition values for indicator abundance and IBI range from 11.9% to 14.4% for Silt and 7.7% to 11.6% for LSand. Converting these values back to standard hazard quotient scales (achieved by dividing the %toxicity value by 50) yields PEQ\u2010Qavg on an absolute scale in the range of 0.24 to 0.29 and 0.15 to 0.23. Notably, these protective values are much lower than the value of 1 commonly used in hazard quotient assessment methods.",

            "text": "SQGs, such as those implemented by MDEQ, are useful for providing toxicity benchmarks on which to evaluate sediment contamination and potential of sediments to contribute to degraded benthos. However, these guidelines cannot be used appropriately without considering the interactive effects of mixtures of chemicals present in the field and different habitats present within the system. Various multi\u2010contaminant toxicity score approaches have been developed. However, different scoring methods generate different estimates of sediment toxicity and each computational approach contains within it assumptions that can contribute to biases in the prediction. This study demonstrated the applicability of some common multi\u2010chemical multivariate scoring approaches for predicting benthic invertebrate abundance and indices of biological integrity (IBI) under field conditions. It further describes a new method (HZD) that adopts a multipoint calibration through incorporation of information provided by PEC and TEC benchmark values. The HZD score and individual PEC\u2010Q approaches were capable of predicting Chironomidae abundances and IBI score values in 2 types of Detroit River habitats with varying degrees of success. The HZD approach provided the best estimate of chironomid abundance in silt habitat, whereas PEC\u2010Qsum produced the best estimate of chironomid abundance in low flow sand habitats followed closely by the HZD score as the second best metric. As for the multivariate approaches, the multimetric IBI approach showed correlations in the Silt and LSand habitats for each of the SQG scoring metrics. However, none of the metrics were able to predict abundances of other organism groups and habitat types indicating some limitations of the toxicity interpretation of SQGs across habitat types and species. This implies that habitat\u2010 and taxonomic\u2010specific SQGs are likely warranted. Overall, the universality of SQGs is generally limited by: 1) the types of organisms present in the local environment and their tolerance to contaminant and habitat quality; 2) differences in contaminant availability based on site physical and chemical characteristics; and 3) unknown toxicological interactions of multiple contaminants at a site. Overall, the SQG LOE screening can be useful as part of a full WOE assessment of sites to identify impacts of contamination on the sediment benthos. The method is made more powerful when habitat characteristics are considered within the SQG LOE assessment process and this has the added advantage of adopting consistency in approach with other LOEs that exclusively consider biological community composition alterations relative to habitat matched reference locations.",
