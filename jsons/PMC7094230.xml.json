Abdominal CT demonstrated a small right subcapsular hematoma at the site of the liver biopsy. On hospital day 3, the patient spiked a fever with a temperature of 38.9\u00b0C. Blood and urine cultures were sent to the laboratory and the patient was started on a regimen of oral clarithromycin.

            "text": "Phase III occurred approximately 158 days following BMT when the patient developed acute respiratory failure. Was coronavirus pneumonia responsible for her respiratory failure? We believe so. The BAL sample was obtained 36 h after intubation and the bronchoscope was placed into the lumen of the endotracheal tube, thus minimizing possible nasal mucosa contamination. We have considered other possibilities. For example, the coronavirus could simply have been present in the BAL specimen, but was not pathogenic. In this scenario, the etiology of the respiratory failure could have been caused by several different factors, including radiation pneumonitis, drug-induced interstitial pneumonitis, or showering of the lung with inflammatory cytokines from an abdominal or septic source resulting in ARDS. Radiation pneumonitis seems less likely since the pattern of radiographic lung injury does not duplicate the radiation port,6 although case studies have shown that radiation pneumonitis can occur outside the radiation port.22 It would be unusual to see interstitial pneumonitis from the HDC/ABMT this far out after transplant and without a concomitant decrease in Dlco.6 The liver biopsy, which occurred 2 days before respiratory failure, was complicated by a stable subcapsular hematoma, a brief episode of hypotension, and fever. We cannot exclude the possibility that inflammatory cytokines, released from GI sources, showered the lung causing acute lung injury leading to respiratory failure. Also, we could not rule out bacterial pneumonia as a complicating factor since the patient was receiving antibiotics for >24 h prior to obtaining BAL fluid and this would be predicted to lower our diagnostic yield of bacteria.",
