In 2012, international tourist arrivals in the Middle East were estimated at 52 million [1]. Travelers can be exposed to various infectious agents and may facilitate their spread across borders. The importance of travel in the dissemination of respiratory diseases [2] has been demonstrated by the rapid worldwide spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and the recent pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) in 2009 [3], [4].",

Coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses. MERS-CoV belongs to Betacoronavirus phylogenetic lineage C that, in addition to MERS-CoV, contains 2 distinct bat-associated CoV species (HKU4 and HKU5) [7]. As of 15th May 2014, globally, 572 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have officially been reported to WHO, including 173 deaths [6]. We summarize travel-related cases of MERS-CoV with focus on the epidemiology and prevention in travelers.",

Hypotheses include frequent zoonotic infections with limited subsequent human-to-human transmission chains with self-sustained epidemic in humans [16], [11]. There is growing evidence that the dromedary camel is a reservoir for the MERS-CoV and is playing an important role in the transmission to humans [15], [18], [19]. Although bats have been the ultimate progenitor virus, epidemiologically appears more likely that camels would be the source of infection in humans [6]. The ways of human-to-human transmission include direct transmission through droplets produced during coughing or sneezing, indirect transmission through contact with contaminated surfaces and devices [6]. A recent study showed that when MERS-CoV is added to unpasteurized camel milk stored at 4 \u00b0C, the virus remains infectious beyond 72 h but that infectious viruses could not be found after pasteurization [7].",

The travel-associated MERS-CoV cases reported by countries outside the Arabian Peninsula in 2014 occurred in persons with residence in or travel to countries of the Middle East. The first imported case in Greece [11] increased to six the number European countries with confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection amongst travelers, namely Germany, Greece, France, Italy, Netherlands and the United Kingdom (UK) [6]. Furthermore, imported primary cases have been reported by other countries outside Europe such as Egypt, Tunisia, Malaysia and the Philippines (Fig. 1\n) [6]. Characteristics of MERS-CoV infection cases in travelers are presented in Table 1\n. The majority of them were male (92.8%), and between 27 and 73 years of age, with a case fatality rate of 28.5%. Most common destination was Saudi Arabia (64.2%). Travel related cases have been associated with secondary cases in close contacts of index cases without a travel history suggesting person-to-person, although limited, transmission; a total of seven secondary cases have been reported in the literature [9], [12], [13], [16]. Family clusters have been described in relation to the imported cases in Tunisia and the UK [9], [16] as well as in health-care settings [13], [17], [20].",

A recent Greek airport based survey which was conducted from 2011 to 2013 showed that 46.8% of business travelers who visited tropical and subtropical areas traveled to the Middle East [21]. Many Middle Eastern countries are home to large foreign-born populations including migrant workers. Five of all MERS CoV cases amongst travelers concerned expatriates who resided in Saudi Arabia [11], [16], [17]; three of them were health-care workers [16], [17]; this highlights the importance of adherence to recommended infection-control measures, such as standard, contact, and airborne precautions (including eye protection), for health-care workers working in health care settings in the affected countries, while managing patients under investigation or who have probable or confirmed MERS-CoV infections [16]. Contact with animals, in particular visiting, or working in a camel farm is considered a risk factor for acquiring the disease; the Malaysian pilgrim, the first UK and the two German imported cases reported contact with camels during their stay in the Arabian Peninsula (35.7% of all cases) [10], [14], [22]. This information was not known in 50% of the cases (Table 1).",

Communicable disease outbreaks of various infectious diseases have been reported repeatedly, during and following the Hajj [23]. Several studies have been carried out for the surveillance of MERS-CoV in pilgrims [24], [25], [26], [27]. A rapid acquisition of respiratory viruses, mainly rhinovirus was found in 39% of French pilgrims who suffered from respiratory symptoms soon after commencing the 2012 Hajj, with 11% returning infected to France with potential spreading of these respiratory viruses [25]. No case of MERS-CoV nasal carriage was evidenced in this cohort, despite high rates of respiratory symptoms [26]. Similarly, there was no evidence of MERS-CoV nasal carriage among Hajj pilgrims in another study which was performed on pilgrims from 22 countries attending the 2013 Hajj [27]. This study revealed that rates of compulsory vaccinations uptake were high, whereas uptake of pneumococcal and flu seasonal vaccinations were low, including among the high-risk population showing pilgrims' poor compliance with vaccine recommendations [27]; this may explain the increased prevalence of influenza in pilgrims [28]. Although there was no evidence of MERS-CoV nasal carriage during screening of Hajj pilgrims, three of the cases amongst travelers concerned pilgrims returning from Mecca to the country where they reside (Malaysia, Netherlands and United Kingdom, respectively) [9], [16]. The patient from Malaysia, a 54 year-old man with underlying health conditions traveled to Saudi Arabia with a pilgrimage group of 18 and visited a camel farm, during which he consumed camel milk. There was no human-to-human transmission observed amongst close contacts and in health-care facilities in Malaysia [16]. The case from the Netherlands which concerned a 70 year old man reported no contact with animals or consumption of raw animal products. Identification of close contacts, including flight contacts was also initiated [16]. Cluster cases were reported during contact tracing of the third case which concerned an adult middle-aged male in the United Kingdom who visited Mecca and Medina on pilgrimage. No direct contact with animals or with people with severe respiratory illness was reported in the 10 days before the onset of his illness. Contact tracing, including aircraft passengers identified two secondary cases among family members without a history recent travel: one developed a severe respiratory illness and died and the other influenza-like illness; no other severe cases were identified or CoV detected in respiratory samples among 135 contacts for the following 10 days [9].",

Based on the predicted population movements out of Saudi Arabia, a potential for a global spread of MERS-CoV can not be excluded according to Kahn and colleagues [29].

Therefore, people visiting the Middle East at all times of the year and in particular pilgrims of Hajj and Umrah should take precautions such as: avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections, take personal hygiene measures (frequent hand-washing, cough and sneeze etiquette), adhering to food safety and hygiene rules (avoiding unsafe water, undercooked meats, raw fruits and vegetables unless they have been peeled). Raw camel milk consumption in the Middle East may be associated with several zoonotic infections; therefore it is advisable for Hajj pilgrims to avoid unpasteurized milk. It is also recommended to avoid close contact with live farm or wild animals in particular camels [36]. Travelers to the Middle East who develop respiratory symptoms either during travel or within 14 days after their return should seek medical attention. A history about their recent trip should be given. Furthermore they should practice cough etiquette (cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues, maintain distance, and wash hands) and to postpone their travel until they are no longer symptomatic (Table 2\n) [5], [6], [7], [37], [38].",

The majority of MERS-CoV cases are reported in Saudi Arabia with a significant rate of hospital transmission. The possibility of airborne transmission is very low and secondary cases are only likely after close contact and due to severe symptoms there is only little likelihood of unregistered clinical cases. Countries should focus on increasing awareness of travelers visiting friends and relatives and of health professionals about patients with severe respiratory symptoms who report a recent history of travel to the region affected with MERS-CoV. Travel medicine practitioners should not discourage travelers to visit these countries as long as they follow the basic hygienic measures. Travelers should be advised to avoid local hospitals if medical help is needed and to be visited by a doctor instead. Measures should be taken by local health authorities of the affected countries in order to improve hospital hygiene. In addition, it is crucial to investigate the reasons for travelers' poor compliance with rules and recommendations issued by Saudi officials and to take appropriate measures in order to improve them.",
