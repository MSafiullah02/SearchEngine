            "text": "The elaboration of cytokines by distinct cell types and their activities on either themselves (autocrine) or on neighboring or more distant cells (paracrine and systemic, respectively) has been well documented as a part of both specific and innate immune responses. The cell surface receptors and the intracellular signal transduction pathways have been elucidated for many of these molecules 1, 2, 3. The cytokines secreted in response to a variety of stimuli have been used to define distinct subsets (for example, CD4, Th2 cells are characterized to produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-10). However, almost exclusively, studies such as these have been performed using cells of the hematopoietic lineages (e.g. lymphocytes and macrophages). Many cytokines are produced or responded to by cells of other lineages. There is a growing body of literature of regulated cytokine gene expression in the CNS both by parenchymal cells in addition to inflammatory mononuclear cells [4]. This has been observed for autoimmune diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and its animal model, experimental allergic encephalitis, as well as in response to bacterial and viral infections 5, 6, 7. Cytokines may be elaborated to recruit and activate circulating mononuclear cells, but it also appears that resident parenchymal cells both synthesize cytokines and respond to them 4, 8, 9. In order to respond to cytokines, cells must express receptors and also have the necessary signal transduction machinery for communicating receptor occupancy 1, 2, 3. Subsequently, there must be a change in the gene expression of the cell, in response to the cytokine ligand-receptor binding. In some cases, cytokines deliver a differentiating or activating signal. Alternatively, in the case of TNF-\u03b1 action for many cells, for instance, the response may be to initiate the apoptosis cascade 10, 11, 12. There is abundant evidence of tissue pathology, including cell death, in the CNS associated with inflammatory cytokine synthesis 10, 13. This review is focused on the effects of one cytokine, interleukin-12 (IL-12).",

            "text": "IL-12 is a 70 kD heterodimer of 35 and 40 kD peptides [14]. It is synthesized by antigen (Ag) presenting cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, B-lymphocytes, and astrocytes in response to stimulae which may include bacterial cell wall products 14, 15, 16, 17. IL-12 was initially characterized as a Natural Killer (NK) cell activator [18]and promotes the production of Th1 CD4 effector cells from Th0 precursors [15]. IL-12 has been shown to mediate a broad range of effects on both innate and acquired immunity. It induces IFN-\u03b3 production by NK, Th1 and CD8 cells, regulates T-cells proliferation, stimulates NK cell activity, and enhances CD8 CTL responses 18, 19, 20. IL-12 has been shown to induce IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in serum and in brain tissue homogenates in mice 21, 22, 23. Orange and co-workers showed that high levels of exogenous IL-12 induced strong acute phase responses and were associated with host toxicity through the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis [22], demonstrating an interaction of the immune and stress response systems. IL-12 has been shown to serve as a direct chemotactic factor for NK cell infiltration and increases its binding to vascular endothelium cells in vitro\n[24]. NK cells infiltrate the virus-infected CNS before T-cell infiltration 25, 26. NK cells have an important role in clearance of many viral infections that is independent of T-cell function 27, 28. NK cells secrete IFN-\u03b3, which participates in a positive feed-back loop amplifying IL-12 production. IL-12 also induces Th1-specific immune responses by promoting the differentiation of TH1 cells from Th0 precursors at the expense of Th2 effector cell, inhibiting IL-4 production 29, 30. The Th1 subset secretes IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and lymphotoxin (LT, TNF-\u03b2). Th1 cells are also cytolytic, recognizing MHC Class II and Ag. They mediate delayed-type hypersensitivity, and are thus involved in inflammation. \nIn vitro, IL-12 suppresses the synthesis of IgE by IL-4 stimulated B-cells [31]. In vivo, intraperitoneal injection of IL-12 resulted in the enhancement of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 gene expression, reduced levels of IL-3 and IL-4 gene expression, and increased serum IgG2a levels [32]. The in vivo effects of IL-12 on immunoglobulin isotypes were only partially mediated by IFN-\u03b3. The administration of anti-IL-12 antibodies in vivo significantly blocked Th1 response to antigen, evaluated by either IFN-\u03b3 production or serum IgG2a antibody response 33, 34. Thus IL-12 production may antagonize the differentiation of Th2 cells and their expansion of B-cells switching to the epsilon heavy chain [32]; IgE readily sensitizes mast cells, thus early expression of IL-12 during sensitization can inhibit the development of immediate hypersensitivity such as allergic rhinitis and asthma. IL-12 knockout mice have been produced. It was also shown that IL-12-deficient mice are defective in IFN-\u03b3 production and type 1 cytokine responses [35]. These results suggest that IL-12 has a role in antigen-induced Th1 differentiation in vivo and its effects on Ig isotypes. However, in spite of the lack of IL-12 secretion in the knockout mice, Th1 cells are able to develop and are active for alloantigen responses [36]and for responses to the coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus [37]. This suggests that other factors or cytokines may regulate Th1 cell differentiation, possibly IL-18 (reviewed in [38]). IL-12 treatment of experimental animals has been found to modify the course of many infectious diseases and the response to tumors 39, 40. In short, where an inflammatory delayed hypersensitivity (Type IV hypersensitivity) or cytolytic T-cell response is beneficial to the host, IL-12 treatment generally promotes recovery from the infection or tumor challenge. Where inflammatory responses are disadvantageous, such as in several autoimmune diseases, IL-12 treatment does not promote recovery 41, 42. The effects of IL-12 on the hosts response to viral infection will be discussed in detail.",

They have termed the two chains \u03b21 and \u03b22, due to the sequence relatedness to other \u03b2 chains of the hematopoietic growth factor receptor families. Th2 cells, which do not respond to IL-12, have been shown to express only one (\u03b21) of the two IL-12R chains, which will bind IL-12 at low affinity 42, 44, 46. The signal transduction pathway has been defined in lymphoid cells to include activation of Janus kinase family members Tyk2 and Jak2, which in turn activate Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT)3 and STAT4 48, 49. A model of the IL-12 receptor interaction with its transducers is shown in the accompanying figure. For contrast, a very well characterized receptor, is included. IL-2R is known to react with Ras which phosphorylates Mitogen Activated Protein kinases (MAP kinases) which trigger nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) activation and signaling also through the phosphoinositol-3 (Pl-3) kinase pathway in addition to Jaks 1 and 3 and STATs 3 and 5. STATs are inactive in the cytoplasm until a ligand-induced activation of the cell takes place. Receptor-mediated cascades lead to phosphorylation of STATs by members of the Jak/Tyk family of tyrosine kinases and subsequent homo- or hetero- dimerization. The dimers are able to translocate to the nucleus where transcription is initiated 1, 2, 3, 50. Of all the cytokines and growth factors examined to date, STAT4 has uniquely been found to be phosphorylated by IL-12 [48]. Other stimuli are more promiscuous or overlapping in their STAT activation in lymphocytes 1, 2, 3. Mice deficient in STAT4 have been developed and initially examined for functional responses [51]. They appear to be deficient in Th1 responses and sufficient in Th2 responses to specific Ags. STAT6 knockout mice are able to mount Th1 responses but not Th2, from which it was concluded that STAT6 is essential for the IL-4 response [52]. Mice deficient in Jak2 have recently been described to be embryonic lethal; they have impaired erythropoiesis, so that the impact of this deficiency on cytokine signaling in lymphocytes cannot easily be defined 53, 54.",

IL-12 activity is not dependent on either IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1 in the IFN-\u03b3-deficient mice [63]. However, IL-12 activity appears to require intracellular activity of NOS-1 in neurons for clearance of virus (not shown) and for host survival [23](Fig. 5\n). Nitric oxide (or its reaction product peroxynitrite) is a potent antiviral in many systems [64]. Most investigators have administered IL-12 either prior to or beginning on the day of infection. To be practical, however, if it were to be administered during human infections to viruses, IL-12 should be efficacious after infection has started, when symptoms are becoming apparent to the patient. IL-12 does have recovery-promoting activity even after the start of a lethal VSV encephalitis infection (Fig. 6\n).",

IL-12 p40 or p35 knockout mice responded to MHV infection with a Th1 response like wild type mice, which was unexpected [37].

Whether IL-12 acts directly or indirectly through IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1 and their downstream responses (RNAase L, NOS, caspases, for instance), as shown in Fig. 1\n, the general effects are (1) the recruitment and induction of NK cells, (2) cytokine release by innate immune and T-cells, (3) facilitating the differentiation of Th1 cells which are both inflammatory and cytolytic as well as helpers, (4) amplifying CD8 responders, (5) enhancing the production of neutralizing IgG2a Ab, and ultimately (6) the inhibition of viral replication and clearance of virus from host cells. These activities appear both in peripheral and in CNS infections. Table 1\nillustrates some of the cytokine-inducible proteins and their activities in virally infected cells. Since IL-12 works both at the time of infection, and also after symptoms and viral replication has begun (Fig. 6), it may be efficacious in treating humans. IL-12 treatment also enhances responses to vaccination, whether by co-administration of cytokine at the time of inoculation of protein Ags, or by genetic vaccination [68]. The cytokine is already in Phase II clinical trials for renal carcinoma and trials are under way for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections, both long-term treatments; therefore, it may be relatively easy to develop clinical trials from human encephalitis (picornavirus, rabies), for Herpes infections, and for HIV. It may not be a magic bullet alone, but may substantially augment antiviral drug therapies.",

Half of the mice of each genotype were treated with 200 ng IL-12 by parenteral injection (solid bars), the others were treated with medium injections (hatched bars). Most mice succumb between days 7 and 10 post infection. IL-12 treatment of uninfected mice did not result in mortality. Data shown is pooled from five separate experiments.
