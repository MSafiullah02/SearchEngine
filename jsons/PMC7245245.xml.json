Cancer patients will be disproportionately affected due to their high utilization of health care services and the potential immunosuppressive effects of therapy. Patients with cancer or a history of cancer are more likely to be infected with COVID-19 [2,3]. Furthermore, cancer patients with COVID-19 infection have an increased risk of severe sequelae, including need for intensive care, ventilation, and death [[2], [3], [4]]. Gynecologic oncology patients frequently require complex invasive procedures and immunosuppressing therapies. This places them at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and its potentially fatal effects, which presents a unique challenge to the health care providers caring for them.",

The SGO and American College of Surgeons (ACS) have issued general recommendations encouraging cancellation of non-essential clinic visits and operations [1,5]. While some practices have universal application, guidelines need to be taken in the context of local COVID-19 burden, as well as governmental and hospital specific recommendations. We polled the SGO membership to assess the impact of COVID-19 on their patients, their practice, and themselves.

Additionally, participants from 88.6% of responding states reported COVID-19 infections in their gynecologic oncology population. However, there is geographical variability in the COVID-19 burden as evidenced by the wide range (0\u2013100%) of reported gynecologic oncology patient exposures. The Northeast region of the United States, New York in particular, is the most dramatically affected. This is consistent with New York's unenviable position of being an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. While our survey only showed a trend towards higher urban infection risk in the Northeast, other reports show that cites are more affected and our infection rate is likely an underestimate given that it is calculated per responder to avoid the risk of double counting patients [7]. One of the best ways to further define both individual risk and assess the overall COVID-19 prevalence would be widescale testing. Unfortunately, respondents believe that only about half of those with an exposure are currently being tested. While the diagnostic shortfall must be addressed, the low reported COVID-19 infection rate in gynecologic oncology patients is encouraging. This could be due to the high reported level of provider concern leading to a 99.7% reported adoption rate of infection mitigation strategies like social distancing and cancellation of non-urgent care. Participants reported a >60% drop in patient care volume spread across both outpatient and inpatient treatments. Most of this decreased volume is likely due to mitigation efforts given only 30% of the reported outpatient cancellations were patient initiated and most of the cancelled surgery would fit into the \u201celective\u201d category.",

Cancer surgeries, with the possible exception of grade 1 endometrioid uterine cancer staging, are moving forward with minimal delays. However, ovarian cancer presents a particular challenge. Ovarian debulking surgery was rated as the most concerning treatment during the pandemic. This combined with the frequent need for chemotherapy are likely why ovarian cancer was rated as the most impacted gynecologic cancer by COVID-19. Interestingly, despite concerns regarding immunosuppression from maintenance therapy, most respondents have not changed their practice patterns in either the upfront or recurrent setting. A potential explanation for this is that maintenance therapies are generally well tolerated which could delay the need for appointment-intensive interventions such as imaging, laboratory testing and chemotherapy infusion.",

In this study, responders reported a 60% drop in clinical volume which implies that there are gynecologic cancer patients who are either unable to be diagnosed or are deferring care until COVID-19 abates. COVID-19 will be part of life for the near future and cancer care decisions must reflect this reality. It is imperative as a specialty that we have systems in place to identify these patients as well as prepare for the increased surgical need. Potential strategies to limit the risk of a second surge in the gynecologic cancer population would be routine COVID-19 testing prior to surgery or chemotherapy, maximizing same day discharges, and keeping cancer treatment areas separated from those with a COVID-19 diagnosis.",

Despite the limited time to answer and demands of the COVID-19 on gynecologic oncologists, this survey contains replies from over 300 providers specializing in gynecologic oncology. To increase the response rate to the survey, we did the original mailing followed by 2 reminders. To address non-responder bias, we did include a comparison between the responder's information including practice level and location to that from the April 2020 SGO membership which showed comparable proportions in each of the available pieces of information.",
