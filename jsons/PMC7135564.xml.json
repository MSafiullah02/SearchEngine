The concept of biosecurity is not new, however it is likely that renewed awareness has been accelerated by several factors. Recent international events such as the outbreak of foot and mouth Disease (FMD) in the United Kingdom and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE, mad cow disease) in Europe and US has demonstrated vulnerability of national animal resources. The potential risk of agri-terrorism has also helped spur global interest in biosecurity. Notwithstanding these events, biosecurity in the alpaca industry is, and will be, primarily driven by breeders and veterinarians in order to optimize the care and production of alpacas.",

These efforts can be further categorized into external measures (external biosecurity), those directed at prevention of entry of new diseases into a group; internal measures (internal biosecurity, biocontainment), those directed at prevention of spread of disease within a group (Dargatz et al., 2002). Therefore, biosecurity can be implemented at various levels, from those involving specific farms to governmental regulationzs involving importation of animals. To be valid, the minimum biosecurity plan should address: (1) the means of isolating new animals introduced into an existing herd or group of animals, (2) the regulation of animal, worker and equipment trafficking (movement), and (3) the design and implementation of cleaning and disinfection procedures directed at the reduction of pathogen load within a herd or group of animals.",

Yet, over-dependence on these technologies may have inadvertently fostered a level of indifference to more traditional management components involved in disease control, namely biosecurity (Anderson, 1998). Many examples exist whereby in the face of an outbreak, both producers and veterinarians rapidly seek the development of a new vaccine rather than address basic principals of internal and external biosecurity. Ideally, management should strive to incorporate and coordinate a spectrum of available tools, from the execution of optimal husbandry practices to the implementation of modern technologies.",

Regardless of the species of animal, the most common means by which contagious diseases are introduced to a herd involves the introduction of new animals. Clearly, introduction of new animals displaying any clinical signs of disease should be avoided. Moreover, producers must realize that the mere exclusion of clinically affected animals is insufficient for preventing disease introduction. Animals that appear to be clinically normal can be either incubating disease or be subclinically affected. In fact, it is well documented that within most populations of animals, only a fraction of animals typically exhibit clinical disease, whereas a larger proportion are subclinically affected. Consequently, appropriate and effective efforts in biosecurity must focus on the entire population of animals, rather than prioritize only those clinically affected.",

As previously mentioned, the most prevalent means of introducing disease into a group of animals is via the addition of new animals to the herd. It is important to realize the breadth of the concept of this \u201cnew animal\u201d (or animals). Acquisition of an animal which has never resided on a farm is inherently seen as new. However, the concept of a new animal should also include the reintroduction of those which have been temporarily residing at other facilities. When animals are commingled at breeding farms or shows, there is an increased risk of disease transmission. Importantly, transfer of certain agents does not necessarily require direct contact between animals. Some pathogens are efficiently transmitted in the air or water, some can survive in soil or organic debris for extended periods (weeks to months), and some are efficiently transmitted via fomites (equipment, tack, etc.), pests (flies, rodents, etc.), or personnel (Barrington et al., 2002).",

Buyers should not only be knowledgeable about the current health status of the herd of origin, but also seek historical information concerning past diseases or conditions within the herd. Specific conditions to inquire about might include respiratory diseases, gastro-intestinal conditions (diarrhea, etc.), ill thrift, failure of passive transfer, abortion, and other herd-based disease. In addition to seeking historical information concerning disease occurrence, buyers should also be knowledgeable concerning fundamental biosecurity practices of the herd of origin. Questions regarding animal movement, quarantine practices, disease testing, vaccination practices, de-worming schedules, and other herd health practices should be asked.

Typically such events include the commingling of numerous animals from different sources. Many animals have traveled long distances and have been housed for varying periods of time. Upon arrival, changes in environment can serve as a source of stress for animals. Some changes might include new footing/bedding, different temperatures/humidity/ventilation, variation in lighting, different water or feed source, and different personnel. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that significant risk of disease exists in these settings, despite the fact that animals attending such events typically have been examined and deemed to be healthy on health certificates. The stresses of travel, commingling, and environmental changes may exacerbate latent disease conditions resulting in the onset of clinical disease, or at least the shedding of organisms that went unnoticed during the time of veterinary inspection.",

Without a doubt, commingling of numerous animals from varying backgrounds, including mature females and their nursing crias, carries an extremely high risk for exposing these animals to infectious diseases.

Under the right conditions, flies can harbor certain pathogens (e.g. Cryptosporidium parvum) for up to 3 weeks (Graczyk et al., 2000). Numerous methods have been described for controlling flies during different points in their life cycle, including the use of various chemical agents. In addition to chemical means, control must also include the removal of feces and wet organic debris, since fly larvae require the appropriate substrates and levels of humidity (>90%).",

In general, alpaca colostrum contains a relatively high concentration of immunoglobulin, therefore FPT rarely occurs as a result of poor colostrum quality. Instead, FPT in crias generally results from a failure to nurse appropriately within the first hours of life. Factors associated with a cria that is unable to nurse include neonatal maladjustment (hypoxia at parturition), cleft palate, choanal atresia, fractures or other causes that limit mobility or nursing. Hypothermia or mis-adventure could result if a cria is born unsupervised or at pasture. Maternal factors associated FPT in crias include mis-mothering, teat or udder abnormalities, agalactia, or conditions causing recumbency of the dam.

Despite the fact that no vaccines have been approved for use in camelids in the United States, it is obvious that many are used in an extra-label fashion. Importantly, extra-label use carries no assurance of efficacy or safety. Therefore, the basic foundation for immunizing alpacas is rather limited and includes immunization with C. perfringens type C and D toxoid, and C. tetani toxoid. A killed rabies vaccine and a leptospirosis bacterin can be used if either disease is endemic. While several other vaccines have been administered to alpacas, it is advisable that any modified-live virus vaccine or live bacterin be used with extreme caution in an extra label manner. Finally, no legitimate scientific information exists concerning the timing of vaccinating alpacas. In general, similar schedules to other domestic livestock are used with alpacas.",

To maintain appropriate hydration, animals should be allowed free access to water sources that do not freeze.

Prevention of heat stress should center on management changes that facilitates cooling (Middleton and Parish, 1999). Shearing practices should be adjusted to coincide with seasons of high environmental temperature. Alpacas should always have access to sufficient shade, and ideally be housed with damp, sandy soils which facilitate thermoregulation when animals lie in ventral recumbency. Sprinklers that spray on the animal's ventrum, or wading ponds can be used. Provision of adequate clean, fresh drinking water is essential. In severe conditions, air-conditioned stalls may be necessary. Importantly, any time animals are housed in confined areas (either during hot or cold weather), attention must be paid to provide adequate ventilation.

Yet, varnished plywood retains approximately 115-fold more microorganisms than plastic surfaces. On smooth impervious surfaces such as metal or plastic, washing with soap and water to remove visible contamination results in the elimination of approximately 99% of the microbial load. Similar washing of typical household surfaces removes approximately 90% of the microbial load and it is reasonable to presume that washing of rough lumber will remove even less organisms.
