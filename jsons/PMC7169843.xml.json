Pigs at all ages are susceptible to the disease. However, mortality is high in young pigs, especially in piglets younger than one\u2010week old. Since its first discovery in the late 1970s (Chasey & Cartwright, 1978; Pensaert & de Bouck, 1978), PED has continued to cause severe economic impact in swine industry worldwide. Starting from the end of 2010, a PED outbreak occurred in several pig\u2010producing provinces in southern China due to new porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) variants. Subsequently, the disease spread throughout the country and caused enormous economic losses to the pork industry (Chen et al., 2011, 2012, 2013; Li, Li, et al., 2012; Li, Zhu, et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013).",

At present, four PEDV variants belonging to G1a, G1b, G2a and G2b groups were currently characterized (Lee, 2015; Sun et al., 2015). The PEDV genome consists of seven open reading frames (ORFs) as following: ORF1a, ORF1b, spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N) (Kocherhans, Bridgen, Ackermann, & Tobler, 2001). The S protein is a glycosylated protein involved with viral pathogenesis and further divided into S1 and S2 domains. The S gene is divergent and important for understanding of the genetic relations of PEDV field strains, the epidemiological status of the virus and vaccine development (Park, Kim, Song, Moon, & Park, 2011; Stott et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2012).",

Using the typical classification method (Lee, 2015), we divided all strains into four groups, in which G2a and G2b are the two most prevalent in China. Traditionally, there was more than one group of strains prevalent in one region, which made PEDV prevention more difficult and complicated.
