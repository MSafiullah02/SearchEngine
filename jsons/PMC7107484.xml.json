The vaccine is given in three doses, one each at the ages of 2, 3, and 5 months. A prospective study carried out in 2009\u20132011 found that hospital admissions for rotavirus-associated AGE (RV-AGE) in Finland were reduced by 80% in the first season after the introduction of RV5, and no change was seen in the second season [8]. This type of pattern was also reported in the United States, in which a high impact of rotavirus vaccination was seen in the first season after vaccine introduction followed by a rise in rotavirus activity in the second season, low activity in the third season, and so on [9, 10]. Indirect effects of rotavirus vaccination were also reported among unvaccinated children and adults in the United States, Austria, and Belgium [9, 11, 12]. In contrast, the introduction of RV5 has given rise to some vaccine-derived rotavirus (vdRV) strains. One clinically significant strain is a double-reassortant vdG1P[8], which originates from vaccine strains G1P7[5] and G6P1[8] [13, 14]. The vdG1P[8] strain can cause disease and infect unvaccinated children and can spread in the environment [15].",

In Finland, wtRV genotype G3P[8] was less common in the prevaccination years; however, this finding has to be considered with caution, because the numbers in the post-NIP years are much smaller than those in the prevaccination years.

Among these strains, genotype G1 was detected in 81%, which is in accordance with the results from a study by Markkula et al [30], who looked for rotavirus shedding in children who were <2 years of age and hospitalized with respiratory diseases in Finland. All children with vdRV were also studied for the presence of AGE possibly caused by other viruses. Only 2 children with double-reassortant vdG1P[8] did not have any sign of coinfection with other pathogens; therefore, these cases of AGE were probably causally related to vdRV. Of those 2 cases, 1 was a recently vaccinated 3-month-old, and the other was an unvaccinated 7-year-old. The number of symptomatic cases associated with vdG1P[8] might be underestimated in the context of this hospital-based surveillance, in which cases of mild gastroenteritis were not captured.",
