ACEIs enact their blood pressure-lowering effects by blocking the peptidyldipeptidase that hydrolyzes angiotensin I (A-I) to angiotensin II (A-II). In addition, it inactivates bradykinin, a vasodilating peptide promoting the release of nitrogen monoxide and prostacyclin. ARBs have no effect on bradykinin metabolism and block the effects of A-II more selectively than ACEIs. In detail, ARBs determine their antihypertensive effect by preventing the binding of A-II to the A-II receptor type 1 (AT 1 ). Finally, DRIs exert blood pressure-lowering effects by decreasing plasma renin activity and inhibiting the conversion of angiotensinogen to A-I [5] .",

The interaction of the coronavirus spike protein with ACE2, its cellular-binding site, leads to ACE2 downregulation. In turn, this results in excessive production of angiotensin by ACE, whereas less ACE2 is capable of converting it to angiotensin (1-7), an heptapeptide with vasodilator activity [1, 10] . It has been suggested that exaggerated stimulation of AT 1 by A-II determines increased pulmonary vascular permeability, thereby mediating increased lung pathology when the expression of ACE2 is decreased [11, 12] . Thus, higher ACE2 expression following chronic treatment with ARBs may protect patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 against acute lung injury rather than increasing the risk of developing COVID-19.",
