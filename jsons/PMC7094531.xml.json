Hong Kong, which has adopted a Western healthcare system, is no exception to this global issue. In the local context, all public hospitals are managed by a statutory body called the Hospital Authority. Recent news has reported imminent concern regarding the shortage of nursing staff in local public hospitals, noting a staggering rise in the voluntary turnover rate from 3.2% in 2006/2007 to 4.7% in 2008/2009 (Moy, 2009). Since public hospitals account for more than 95% of hospital beds in Hong Kong, the phenomenon has provoked the public's concern regarding its potential threat to the provision of quality care. The local health authority has been adopting strategies such as better salary and promotion prospects to attract and retain nurses, but the effectiveness is yet to be evaluated. However, past studies have suggested that financial incentive is only one of the many factors determining turnover; the underlying causes are complex that need to be addressed by an integrated plan (Milisen et al., 2006).",

The most prominent works are the two studies led by Aiken et al. (2002) and Needleman et al. (2002), who quantifiably evaluated the association between nurse staffing levels and patient outcomes. Aiken et al. (2002) conducted a study on surgical patients and found that higher patient-to-nurse ratios resulted in significant increases in patient mortality and failure-to-rescue rates. Needleman et al. (2002) undertook a similar study on medical and surgical patients and concluded that nurses who spent more time on direct patient care could significantly reduce the duration of patients\u2019 hospitalization and the incidence of adverse events. There are, however, some researchers who have refuted the relationship between nursing manpower and quality of care (Currie et al., 2005, Feinstein, 2002). They argued that provision of care relies on the collective efforts of multidisciplinary members, and patient outcomes should not be attributable to the staffing level of a single profession. Yet there is no doubt that nurses, who offer round the clock surveillance, have been important guardians of patients\u2019 well-being. To ensure delivery of quality health services, an adequate and stable nursing workforce is a requisite.",

The nursing work environment, which provides the context of care delivery, has been identified as the crux that determines nurse and patient outcomes (Aiken et al., 2008, Kotzer and Arellana, 2008). Magnet research, which originated in the early 1980s, has continued to prevail in the past decade. The studies explore the features of \u201cmagnet\u201d hospitals, which are conducive to promoting professional nursing practice and nursing retention, and the findings have further consolidated the positive influence of the \u201cmagnet\u201d environment on nurses\u2019 job satisfaction, autonomy, stress management and outcomes of care (Kramer and Schmalenberg, 2003, Spence Laschinger et al., 2001). Intensive voices have been noted regarding the need to create a healthy work environment for health professionals (Shirey, 2006). A wide range of attributes of the nursing work environment has been identified, including resources, managerial support, co-worker relationships, leadership, autonomy, financial incentives, care delivery models, and sense of professionalism. Researchers further inquired into the issues by devising instruments to capture the features of the nursing work environment. These comprise several well-known instruments such as the Nursing Work Index (NWI) (Kramer and Hafner, 1989), the Revised Nursing Work Index (NWI-R) (Aiken and Patrician, 2000), the Practice Environment Scale (PES) (Lake, 2002), and the Perceived Nursing Work Environment (PNWE) instrument (Choi et al., 2004). Since then, increasing attention has been drawn to the attributes of the nursing work environment, which have been measured through quantification of nurses\u2019 perceptions.",

The findings have enriched our understanding of the attributes of the nursing work environment, but fall short in terms of reflecting how nurses conceptualize and value the attributes that influence their turnover intention. McGillis Hall and Kiesner's (2005) study was groundbreaking in pointing out that it might not always be possible to measure nurses\u2019 work quantifiably. The same principle applies to the attributes of the nursing work environment that might not be made explicit merely through quantitative evaluations. While qualitative studies that examine nurses\u2019 perceptions of their work and work environment are lacking, empirical evidence generated from frontline nurses\u2019 lived experiences should be valued. Besides, it is noted that most of the past studies were grounded on western nurses; since each individual country has its own unique cultural, political and economic climate, the question as to whether their findings and/or recommendations fit the Hong Kong context is left unaddressed.",

The method delineates systematic operational processes to discover the structures and patterns of human experiences, and is composed of two phases: the pre-scientific and scientific phases of explication (Parse, 2001, Van Kaam, 1966). In the pre-scientific phase, the informants provide raw descriptions of their lived experiences. The descriptive expressions are then processed through a scientific explication approach that involves six overlapping steps: listing and preliminary grouping, reduction, elimination, hypothetical identification, application and final identification (Van Kaam, 1966). The process of inquiry leads researchers through a journey of intuiting, describing, reducing and analyzing data to search for the essence of a phenomenon (Parse, 2001). It enables researchers to make explicit the implicit meanings of human perspectives and behaviors, so that researchers can formulate conceptual knowledge pertinent to the understanding of the phenomenon (Omery, 1983, Van Kaam, 1966). The operational processes of the control explication method are delineated in further detail in the analysis section.",

Nurses in this study gave negative appraisals of the need to manage sudden and unexpected incidents and to bear the legal responsibility for work. This was in contrast to McNeese-Smith's (1999) study, which revealed nurses showing enjoyment at the challenging nature of their profession. Further analysis of nurses\u2019 characteristics indicated that younger nurses tend to tackle challenges more positively, while senior nurses tend to view them as a burden. Stress induced by the fear of making errors has also been consistently reported in past studies (Gallagher et al., 2003, McNeese-Smith, 1999). In the local context, government and media reports on the occurrence of errors and sentinel events have further drawn the public's attention to the performance of healthcare personnel (Lui, 2008). Nurses, as the largest workforce among the health professions, are seen as accountable for any errors that happen during the caring process. When asked about their responsibility for patient safety, 96% of nurses and more than 90% of physicians, administrators and pharmacists viewed it as the primary responsibility of nurses (Ramsey, 2005). Meurier et al. (1997) found most nurses willing to take responsibility for their errors, but they experienced emotional distress that resulted in diffidence at work. The researchers further highlighted the need to cultivate a positive culture of learning from errors, so as to build defenses for patient safety.",

Nurses are alert to its potential impacts on staff well-being, which render them more liable to errors and injuries. Absenteeism was also commonly reported in previous studies (McGillis Hall and Kiesners, 2005, Verhaeghe et al., 2006). The issues of understaffing and absenteeism have combined to form a vicious cycle. Nurses who are unable to cope with the work burden are absent from work, which further increases the workload of the remaining staff. Those who find the work conditions unbearable gradually develop an inclination to leave their current positions, which leads to increasing voluntary turnover. Tremendous efforts have been dedicated to tackling this global issue by establishing minimum nurse staffing ratios: a one-to-five nurse to patient ratio was proposed for general medical-surgical units (Chapman et al., 2009, Harrington et al., 2000). Yet skeptics contended that the ratio could not be a gold standard that fits all countries, and quality care should not only be attributable to this single factor (Chapman et al., 2009, Wharrad and Robinson, 1999). To solve the problem, researchers asserted the importance of understanding nursing work and nurses\u2019 context of practice (Spitzer et al., 2006).",

Supervisory support was also noted to have a significant impact on reducing nurses\u2019 intention to leave the nursing profession (Van der Heijden et al., 2010). Nurses in this study described management leaders as not understanding their thoughts and needs, and the quality assurance measures imposed as further increasing their workloads. Consistent with their responses, Cooke (2006) noted that nurses are overloaded with audits. Some managers admitted that audits did not reveal much new information; the problems unveiled in audits had already been reflected from other means such as patient complaints and litigations (Cooke, 2006). Other studies also reported the increasing demands of paperwork, which deprives nurses of direct patient care time (Hallin and Danielson, 2007, McNeese-Smith, 1999).",

Unlike in other studies (Bucknall and Thomas, 1997, Budge et al., 2003), nurses in this study rarely discussed their relationships with other interdisciplinary members. Physicians, as the closest partners of nurses, were only mentioned when nurses argued over their autonomy being overridden by them. The discontent over the autonomy issue might have been so intense as to have masked the discussion of the nurse-physician relationship. The debate over autonomy might be explained by the fact that the majority of nurses are baccalaureate nurses, and more educated nurses tend to have higher role expectations (Lu et al., 2006). Other studies also reported nurses as having limited opportunities to influence patient care decisions and change their work situations (Hallin and Danielson, 2008, Milisen et al., 2006). This might indicate that the culture of hospital practice is still hierarchical in structure. The findings warrant attention since provision of healthcare requires collaborative team efforts; the struggle of power between the two disciplines can hinder communications, which affects provision of quality care.",

The sense of professionalism was gained from recognition from the public and care recipients. Some researchers attributed it to the past outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), following which nurses\u2019 professional image and work values became more widely recognized (Lu et al., 2006). Besides gaining satisfaction from recognition, nurses acquire a sense of accomplishment from advancing knowledge through the patient care process. Professional incentives, such as the opportunities given to fulfill their own potential, were commonly identified in past studies (Lu et al., 2002, Teng et al., 2007). Nurses touched only lightly on the issue of financial incentives, showing an understanding that experience and time are needed for promotion. To a certain extent, this reflects that nurses are not mammonists, they look to provide quality care that underpins their personal and professional values. There remains a concern that this sense of professionalism might gradually be undermined by the less favorable work environment, thus hindering them from providing good nursing care.",

Among the various essential constituents of the nursing work environment, the issue of inadequate staffing has received considerable attention, which takes time to be resolved through professional training and detailed resource planning. Limited focus has been placed on other aspects that can be addressed through organizational efforts, such as the inappropriate handling of patients\u2019 and relatives\u2019 complaints, the sense of deprival of autonomy in patient care, and the existence of work constraints such as frequent audits and documentation. A thorough examination of the healthcare environment should be initiated to identify the obstacles that affect nursing practice and provision of quality care.",

They tend to be modest and reserved, and readily accept compromised work conditions (Hallin and Danielson, 2007). This further casts light on the need to cultivate management leaders\u2019 sensitivity to frontline nurses\u2019 needs. Mounting evidence points to the crucial role of management leaders in providing a productive environment for health professionals. Managers who demonstrate visible leadership are seen as central to success in transforming the work environment; they can foster professional practice by collaborating closely with the organization to streamline the work processes and provide the necessary resources to facilitate provision of care (Armstrong and Laschinger, 2006, Mrayyan, 2004, Shirey, 2006). More channels of communication should be provided to facilitate interactions between frontline nurses, managers and policy makers. Frontline nurses are the health professionals who provide immediate care to patients and the community; they are an invaluable resource in directing healthcare policies. It should be noted that health policies should never negate nurses\u2019 ethical obligation to provide holistic care that underpins the professional values of nursing (Aroskar et al., 2004).",
