MMPs, such as MMP-2, -3 and -9, higher in SF of RA patients than those in OA or controls, are involved in the degradation of joint collagen [4, 5].",

It is secreted by cells in response to inflammatory stimulation and is a potent neutrophil, eosinophil and monocyte chemoattractant in vitro or in vivo [8, 9]. It is also abundant in RA SF and its specific peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase activity (PPIase) for protein folding and transduction has been detected in SF from RA patients, but not in SF from OA patients [10]. CD147, also named ECM metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), is a regulator of MMP production by MAPK pathway [11, 12] and serves as a signalling receptor for extracellular cyclophilins [13, 14]. In RA, our previous studies and some other researches have shown that CD147 overexpression on synoviocytes in RA synovium enhances the production of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and the invasiveness of synoviocytes, and membrane CD147 expression on monocytes/macrophages in RA synovium is much higher than that on monocytes/macrophages derived from RA patient's peripheral blood [11, 15\u201318].",

It is a secreted growth factor that augments the proliferation of human embryonic brain cells and vascular smooth muscle cells [27]. In RA synovial tissues, various cells, including macrophages and endothelial cells, are the sources of CypA [28]. CypA treatment has been reported to have induced macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), TNF-\u03b1, IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2 expression in a dose-dependent manner in THP-1 cells and RA synovium [29, 30], and anti-CD147 antibody or AP-9 has been reported to have inhibited CypA's chemotaxis to mononuclear cells in RA [18]. These data might show the role of CypA as one of the inflammatory mediators involved in the pathogenesis of RA.",

We found that CypA significantly up-regulated MMP-9 expression in monocytes/macrophages derived from RA SFs and M-CSF-differentiated macrophages, while it had less effect on monocytes. This difference suggested that, as one of inflammatory factors, the marked effect of CypA on the MMP-9 production in monocytes/macrophages might need monocytes\u2019 differentiation and maturation. The highest productions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in monocytes/macrophages from RA SF showed high activities of inflammation. Another phenomenon, that MMP-9 production and invasive ability of monocytes/macrophages from RA patients were higher than those from normal humans, suggested that the inflammation activity of monocytes/macrophages in RA patients might be higher than those cells in normal humans. As monocytes/macrophages, CypA also increased MMP-9 production in the THP-1 cells.",

CD147 expression correlates well with MMP expression levels and cell invasive ability in some cancers, such as hepatoma and prostatic carcinoma [19], and the aggressive characteristics of RA synovium are similar to those of neoplastic tissues [31]. In our previous studies, CD147 expression on RA fibroblast (FLS) was found to be higher than that on OA FLS and its expression on monocytes/macrophages derived from RA SF was higher than that derived from normal human peripheral blood. High CD147 expression on monocytes/macrophages significantly up-regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 production of RA FLS by interaction with CD147 itself [19], which formed the homologous or heterogenetic dimer to promote MMP expressions. Soluble CD147 was also found to have enhanced MMP-2 and MMP-9 production of RA FLS by its binding to membrane CD147 (data not shown). In this study, the results showed that CD147 expression increased when monocytes and uTHP-1 were differentiated into macrophages, and both of siRNA and AP-9 against CD147 decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in monocytes/macrophages. The reasons for this down-regulation might be that siRNA down-regulated the quantity of membrane CD147, which in turn reduced CD147 dimers, and that AP-9 inhibited the formation of CD147 dimers between these cells.",

These results suggested that CSA might down-regulate MMPs by decreasing CD147 expression, and CypA might up-regulate MMPs by direct binding to membrane CD147 on monocytes/macrophages and not by increasing CD147 expression. The results of no additional decrease or increase of MMP-9 production when cells were treated with the combination of RNAi and CSA under CypA stimulation suggested that RNAi and CSA targeted the same pathway in CypA-induced MMP-9 production. The increasing CD147 expression on macrophages might be one of the reasons for the difference of CypA's effect on MMP-9 between monocytes and macrophages, which means that the receptor of CypA on cells was increased for enhancing transduction signalling.",

In this study, we confirmed that in RA, the abundant CypA could increase MMP-9 expression and invasion ability of macrophages via direct binding to CD147, which showed the potential role of cyclophilin\u2013CD147 interactions in RA pathogenesis. So, all these results showed the important role of cyclophilin\u2013CD147 interactions during inflammatory responses, and targeting cyclophilin\u2013CD147 interactions may provide a new approach for alleviating tissue inflammation.",

These results suggested that CypA promotes adhesion of monocytes/macrophages to ECM by direct binding to CD147, and also suggested that during the progress of RA, CypA might enhance the adhesive and invasive abilities of monocytes/macrophages to synovium or cartilage and contribute to the joints\u2019 impairment.",
