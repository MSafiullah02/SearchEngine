            "text": "In the present study, we evaluated the viability of non-enveloped viruses, minute virus of mice (MVM) and coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4), and enveloped-viruses, influenza A virus (H1N1) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), on surfaces. We also investigated the impact of the initial concentration of proteins and sodium chloride on the persistence of infectious CVB4 on surfaces. Viral suspensions (>10 4.5 TCID 50 ) were applied to petri dish lids and dried under the air flow of a biosafety cabinet. The recovered viral preparations were titered on appropriate cell lines. Enveloped viruses persisted for less than 5 days while CVB4 and MVM persisted for weeks. However, repetitive cycles of drying and resuspension had a stronger virucidal effect on CVB4 than on H1N1 and HSV-1. These repetitive cycles had no effect on the infectious titer of MVM. When exposed to drying, the initial concentrations of bovine serum albumin (from 0 to 90 mg mL \u22121 ), fetal calf serum (from 0 to 100%), and sodium chloride (from 0 to 300 mg mL \u22121 ) affected the viability of CVB4. CVB4 was more likely to be inactivated by drying in a protein-rich medium, whereas the impact of drying was reduced in the presence of sodium chloride. The results of the present study demonstrated that the resistance of viruses to drying, as suggested by iterative drying, was not due to the heterogeneity of viral subpopulations, but was influenced by media compositions and component concentrations, as illustrated in the model of CVB4.",

The persistence of dried viruses is affected by various environmental conditions and factors such as heat, moisture, pH, and the type of surface (12, 15) . Furthermore, the compositions of media may also influence the persistence of viruses. The impact of drying on viral persistence has been evaluated in previous studies using viruses typically prepared in standardized media, including a cell culture medium supplemented or not with fetal calf serum (FCS) (4, 19) . However, these media are not representative of clinical situations because viruses have been detected in protein-rich media, such as serum, and protein-poor media, including water (11, 17) .",

Inactivation curves for H1N1, HSV-1, and CVB4 encompassed two phases. The first phase lasted 2 h and corres-ponded to rapid decreases in the viral titer of \u22122.33, \u22121.1, and \u22121.5 log 10 TCID 50 mL \u22121 for HSV-1, H1N1, and CVB4, respectively, but not MVM. In the second phase, the viral titers of each virus slowly decreased. Scheuplein and al. reported that the first phase was characterized by water loss due to the evaporation of free water from the surface (14) , which exposes viruses to a liquid-air interface, leading to virus inactivation (18) . Repeated drying followed by resuspension in water was carried out for the first time in the present study. Infectious titers of H1N1, HSV-1, and CVB4 decreased gradually at each cycle, whereas no significant change was observed in the MVM infectious titer. Within these cycles, each resuspension modified particle positions and allowed for the new exposure of viral particles to the liquid-air interface, which may explain the continuous reductions observed in viral titers with each cycle (14) . CVB4, which persisted for 5 weeks under the biosafety cabinet, was fully inactivated by 4 cycles of iterative drying, while H1N1 persisted for 5 d and remained infectious after 8 cycles. This difference can be explained by rehydration during the resuspension process, which markedly inactivated non-lipid viruses, as reported previously for poliovirus (3) . However, MVM, a non-enveloped virus, was not affected by iterative drying.",

Drying was slower in this phase, which can be explained by the slow process of water loss due to the diffusion and elimination of bound water, as demonstrated previously (14) .

These results demonstrated that the resistance of CVB4 to drying was hampered in the presence of BSA or FCS. The survival curves of CVB4 resuspended in 0 to 0.29 mg mL \u22121 BSA in 0 and 1.25% FCS were similar, which is consistent with the corresponding concentration of BSA in FCS under these conditions (0 and 0.30 mg mL \u22121 ). Taken together, these results suggest that the lower resistance of CVB4 in the presence of 0 to 1.25% FCS in our experiments depended on albumin. In contrast, with an initial concentration of more than 1.25% FCS, the impact of drying on CVB4 viability was reduced. A previous study reported that higher concentrations of proteins protected viruses against drying (16) ; however, CVB4 exposed to drying was fully inactivated in the presence of high concentrations of BSA (more than 0.39 mg mL \u22121 ) in the present study. The mechanism underlying the protective effect provided by high concentrations of FCS against drying remains to be determined. At an initial concentration of more than 10 mg L \u22121 , NaCl protected CVB4 from desiccation. This can be explained by a slow rehydration process during sample recovery, which protected the viral capsid, as previously suggested (3). In contrast, the viability of CVB4 was the lowest at a concentration of 9 mg mL \u22121 NaCl, which is the average concentration in blood.",

The pattern of resistance of viruses toward drying, as illustrated in the model of CVB4, was not due to the heterogeneity of viral populations, as suggested by the results of iterative drying. Moreover, media compositions and component concentrations clearly played a role when virus suspensions were exposed to drying. The results of our study suggest that a subsequent increase in solute concentrations in droplets modulated the viability of viruses toward drying. Since the compositions of media play a role in the viability of viruses exposed to drying, the persistence of viruses in natural media (clinical or environmental), instead of defined media, need to be investigated. Further studies will be directed towards this line of investigation in our laboratory.",
