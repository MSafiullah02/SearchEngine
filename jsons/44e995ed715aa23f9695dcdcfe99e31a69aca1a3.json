Investigators searched PubMed, bioRxiv, and me-dRxiv using a strategy detailed in Supplement Table 1 (available at Annals.org). The search was last updated on 15 April 2020. From the broader search, we identified articles that provided data on RT-PCR performance by time since symptom onset or exposure using samples derived from nasal or throat swabs among patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. Inclusion criteria were use of an RT-PCR-based test, sample collection from the upper respiratory tract, and reporting of time since symptom onset or exposure. We excluded articles that did not clearly define time between testing and symptom onset or exposure. We identified 7 studies (2 preprints and 5 peer-reviewed articles) (4 -10) with a total of 1330 respiratory samples analyzed by RT-PCR. Figure 1 summarizes the source data. One study by Kujawski and colleagues (10) provided both nasal and throat samples for each patient; we used only the nasal samples in our analysis.",

Our pooled analysis in-cluded only confirmed cases from those studies. The studies by Liu and colleagues (9) and Guo and colleagues (5) included both confirmed cases (\u22651 positive RT-PCR result, similar to other studies; n = 153 for Liu and n = 82 for Guo) and probable cases as determined by a set of clinical criteria (n = 85 for Liu and n = 58 for Guo) . In both studies, most probable case patients were positive for IgM or IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (67 of 85 probable cases for Liu were IgM-or IgGpositive, and 54 of 58 for Guo were IgM-positive). Thus, 22 participants were considered case patients on the basis of clinical criteria alone because we could not separate them out using the information provided. Supplement Table 2 (available at Annals.org) provides additional details on the source data used in our calculations. As a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of individual studies on our inferences, we excluded each study in turn from calculations of the posttest probability of infection after a negative RT-PCR result (Supplement Figure 3 , available at Annals.org).",

From the sensitivity, we calculated the expected false-negative rate on each day. We also calculated the posttest probability of infection, assuming a pretest probability based on the attack rate in close household contacts of SARS-CoV-2 case patients in Shenzhen, China (77 of 686 [11.2%]) (14) . We assumed a specificity of 100% for RT-PCR, as reported in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration package insert for the Quest RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2, which based its estimate on testing in 72 presumed negative samples from the upper respiratory tract and 30 from the lower respiratory tract (15).

For example, if the rate were due to individual variability in viral shedding, performance would likely not be improved by serial tests. Although we are aware of no large-scale studies, some preliminary reports suggest lack of independence; for example, in 1 case report of a person with infection confirmed on the basis of both radiologic findings and RT-PCR positivity from endotracheal aspirates, RT-PCR results from nasopharyngeal swabs were negative throughout the clinical course (6) . Further studies to better characterize the underlying mechanism for poor diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR are needed to inform testing strategies. The relationship between a false-negative result and infectiousness is unclear, and patients who test negative on samples from nasopharyngeal swabs may be less likely to transmit the virus regardless of true case status. We found an increase in the false-negative rate starting 9 days after exposure; however, it is possible that some of the later results were not true false negatives but rather represented clearance of the infection. Thus, interpretation later in the clinical course depends on the purpose of testing: If the goal is to clear a patient from isolation, these negative results may be correct, although more data are needed given studies showing viral replication in other sites. However, if the goal of the test is to evaluate whether additional follow-up is needed or whether the patient should be treated as SARS-CoV-2-positive for the purpose of contact tracing, the test may not be providing the desired information and caution should be used in decision making. Because antibodies appear later in the course of infection, a combination of antibody testing and RT-PCR might be most useful for patients more remote from symptoms or exposure.",

However, when we did a sensitivity analysis excluding each study in turn, we found that no 1 study was especially influential and inferences were largely unchanged. Sample collection techniques varied across studies (oropharyngeal vs. nasopharyngeal swabs), and several studies stated that samples were from the upper respiratory tract without providing further details. Thus, we could not fully account for differences in sample collection techniques. Most studies tested samples at time of symptom onset rather than time of exposure, leading to high variance in estimates in the first few days after exposure. Our model is applicable only in the setting of a known, one-time exposure, not in the setting of continuous exposure, such as in health care workers who may be exposed daily to SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Finally, most studies defined true-positive cases as those with at least 1 positive RT-PCR result, meaning that patients who never tested positive would not be included; this could lead to underestimation of the true false-negative rate. Two stud-ies included probable cases based on clinical and epidemiologic characteristics even if the patients had never had a positive RT-PCR result or serology. Because such criteria as fever, respiratory symptoms, and imaging findings are nonspecific, misclassification is likely, wherein some proportion of probable cases are actually true negatives rather than false negatives. We believe that this effect was small because excluding these studies from our analysis did not change our primary inferences.",

If clinical suspicion is high, infection should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered. In many cases, time of exposure is unknown and testing is done on the basis of time of symptom onset. The falsenegative rate is lowest 3 days after onset of symptoms, or approximately 8 days after exposure. Clinicians should consider waiting 1 to 3 days after symptom onset to minimize the probability of a false-negative result. Further studies to characterize test performance and research into higher-sensitivity approaches are critical. ",
