            "text": "One of the fastest-growing research areas in genetics in the past few years has been the investigation of structural variation in the human genome, with copy number variants (CNVs) found to be much more common than previously imagined. As well as contributing to interindividual phenotypic variation in the general population, these genomic variants may hold the key to understanding the differences in severity seen in people with chromosomal abnormalities. Aneuploidy, for example, can be regarded as a state of large-scale changed copy number resulting from loss or gain of an entire chromosome, arising due to non-disjunction during cell division in either meiosis I or II. Aneuploidies and other chromosomal abnormalities are a common cause of birth defects and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The spectrum of phenotypes seen in each affected individual is clearly dependant on the particular chromosomal region concerned, although there is still a great deal of variability in the presentation of phenotypes.",

Although many of these people, with the necessary social and clinical support, can and do lead active and fulfilling lives, some DS sub-phenotypes are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in infancy. Congenital heart defects (CHD), for example, occur in ~40% of DS; 50% of these require surgical correction within the first year of life and survival to one year is only ~76% compared with ~91% for non-CHD DS patients (Yang et al.2002). An appreciation of the molecular mechanisms behind this phenotypic variation and the identification of susceptibility loci may provide diagnostic and prognostic markers to enable us to predict the occurrence of clinically serious phenotypes, such as CHD, in DS. Additionally, analysis of these loci might help elucidate the mechanisms of CHD in non-DS children.",

Until recently, it was assumed that there are two copies of every gene in euploid individuals, with one on the maternally-inherited chromosome and the other inherited paternally. Any two human genomes were thought to be 99.9% similar, with the main source of genetic variation due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Technological advances often result in paradigm shifts, however, and an unexpected amount of copy number variation was revealed through the advent of array comparative genomic hybridisation (array CGH) and, more recently, of second-generation sequencing technologies. There are currently over 14,000 CNV regions listed on the TCAG Database of Genomic Variants (DGV, updated March 2010), predicted to overlap a significant proportion of the genome. Approximately 11,500 genes, including over 2600 listed in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database, are reportedly overlapped by CNVs (DGV March 2010).",

Deletion or duplication of dosage-sensitive genes, or their regulatory regions, could have adverse phenotypic effects, and copy number changes correlate with expression of affected genes (Henrichsen et al.2009; Stranger et al.2007). The majority of common CNVs are much smaller than the subset investigated by Stranger et al. (2007), leading them to propose that a substantial proportion of heritable variation in gene expression may be explained by copy number variation. In addition to direct copy number effects, CNVs may also exert positional effects, for example by shifting them closer to or further away from heterochromatin. Furthermore, adverse phenotypic effects may result from interactions between CNVs and other variants, for example a deletion on one chromosome may unmask a harmful recessive allele on the other. Conversely, a genomic duplication that incorporates a harmful mutation may have a double gain-of-function effect: a duplication of the PRSS1 and PRSS2 genes along with a missense mutation was recently shown to cause hereditary pancreatitis (Masson et al.2008).",

            "text": "It is likely, therefore, that CNVs do significantly affect human phenotypes, and this is reflected by an increasing number of associations reported between CNVs and disease (Tables 1, 2). Several autoimmune disorders have been associated with CNVs, including systemic lupus erythematosus (Fanciulli et al.2007), Crohn\u2019s disease (Fellermann et al.2006; McCarroll et al.2008) and psoriasis (Hollox et al.2008), and a range of other diseases have now been associated with CNVs (reviewed in Zhang et al.2009). It has been postulated that CNVs could account for a large proportion of the missing heritability of common diseases that has emerged after the recent plethora of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (reviewed in Manolio et al.2009), but this is the subject of heated controversy. In a recent large-scale genotyping survey of common CNVs, Conrad et al. (2010) found that the CNVs that they were able to genotype easily were only in linkage disequilibrium with 34 out of 1,554 trait-associated SNPs from GWAS, thus they suggest that common CNVs are unlikely to account for much of the missing heritability. There is, however, a particular challenge in analysis of amplified sequences (which may be remote from the original sequence copy (Conrad et al. 2010)), multi-allelic variants (particularly VNTRs) and recurrent events, so further analysis of those CNV types is required before the full contribution of common CNVs to human disease can be assessed.",

Although many CNVs are present in an appreciable proportion of the population, the majority are likely to be less frequent: for example, in our array CGH investigation of 50 apparently healthy French male samples, 809 out of 1469 (~55%) multi-probe CNV regions were identified in only one individual (de Smith et al.2007). Rare copy number changes have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism (Marshall et al.2008; Sebat et al.2007) and schizophrenia (Wilson et al.2006; Xu et al.2008). Furthermore, a number of rare genomic structural variants have recently been associated with obesity (Bochukova et al. 2010; Walters et al.2010), and many more low frequency CNVs with strong effects may contribute to common disease phenotypes: large sample cohorts and different populations will need to be investigated to uncover these rare variants.",

Alternatively, there is potential for even greater amplification of copy number where amplification CNVs are present. A simple duplication CNV on the non-disjoining chromosome may lead to the presence of up to six copies of a gene in a trisomic individual (Fig. 1) and the subsequent phenotypic effects associated with increased gene expression levels. Conversely, a gene deletion on the non-disjoining chromosome may alleviate the expected effect of trisomy by reducing the local copy number state to one or two copies. Thus, the compounded effect of aneuploidy and copy number variation has the potential to generate a much wider range of phenotypes than would be expected on the basis of chromosome number alone. It has been suggested, therefore, that CNVs are likely to act as \u2018modifiers of the phenotypic variability of trisomies\u2019 (Beckmann et al.2007) and the same is probably also true for smaller chromosomal imbalances.",

Other features, however, are only present in a fraction of DS cases: for example, congenital heart defects (CHD) are present in ~40% of cases (Park et al.1977) and gastrointestinal (GI) defects in ~8% of DS (Epstein et al.1991). Leukaemia is also common in DS, with an ~20% increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (Hasle et al.2000), and transient myeloproliferative disorder occurring in ~10% of DS newborns, of which 10\u201320% develop acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AMKL) before the age of 4 (reviewed in Hasle 2001).

Molecular analysis of these patients enables \u2018phenotypic mapping\u2019 by defining the critical genomic regions that harbour genes associated with various phenotypes (Epstein et al.1991). As with all regions of the genome, many common CNVs and rarer genomic structural variants are found on chromosome 21. Two recent reports describe structural variations in which the presence of increased copies of genomic regions on chromosome 21 contributes to human phenotype. In one study, duplication of a region at 21q21 that included the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene was found to cause familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease in five separate families (Rovelet-Lecrux et al.2006). The duplication varied in size from 0.58 to 6.37 Mb and contained from 5 to 12 annotated genes including APP. Despite the largest of these duplications being over 6 Mb, none of the families exhibited any clinical evidence of DS (Cabrejo et al.2006). A second duplication of a 4.3 Mb region at 21q22.13-q22.2, containing just over 30 genes, did help refine the map of the DS critical region (DCR) as it caused a DS phenotype in three family members (Ronan et al.2007). These individuals had the facial characteristics of DS and mild cognitive disability indicating that this region includes part of the DCR but not all of it. It is apparent, therefore, that different sub-phenotypes of trisomy 21 are caused by increased copy number at different regions across chromosome 21. It is also evident that some DS individuals who are trisomic for a particular critical region do not always exhibit the associated phenotype, or display a much milder form.",

For example, our investigation of only 50 healthy French male samples revealed 20 multi-probe CNVs, and an additional 57 single probe CNV signals, on chromosome 21 (de Smith et al.2007): almost half were detected in multiple samples (47%), and 34% had a frequency of >5% (Fig. 2). In addition, these CNVs overlapped 38 known genes. There were several CNVs within TIAM1 (T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis-inducing protein 1), for example, which is expressed in almost all analysed tumour cell lines, including B- and T-lymphomas, melanomas and carcinomas (Habets et al.1995). A CNV was also found within DSCAM\u00b8 which is a good candidate gene for the CHD phenotype seen in DS, as it lies within the predicted minimum critical region and is expressed in the heart during cardiac development (Korbel et al.2009). Several other CNVs have since been discovered in this gene, as listed on the DGV, including a common deletion that incorporates 4 exons (Matsuzaki et al.2009).",

Targeted analysis of such variation might, therefore, represent an effective strategy for refining critical regions and pinpointing genes central to key pathways (i.e. of cardiogenesis or oncogenesis). This would also help to enable the prediction of which individuals may develop serious phenotypes, such as CHD in DS, which may add an extra dimension to antenatal screening programmes in the future by contributing to the process of \u2018informed choice\u2019 by the potential parents of a DS child, as well as well as aiding the long term management of these patients. Additional benefits may also accrue from increased understanding of pathogenic mechanisms relevant to patients with similar phenotypes outside the context of chromosomal imbalance.",
