The ~13\u201316 kb positive-strand RNA genome contains 10\u201313 open-reading frames (ORFs). Approximately three-fourths of the genome encodes the nonstructural proteins (nsp) required for transcription and genome replication. The nsp are encoded by two overlapping ORFs. ORF1a contains three to four protease domains and three transmembrane domains. The size of ORF1a is quite variable; for example, PRRSV ORF1a is ~800 bases longer than EAV ORF1a. ORF1b is much more conserved among the arteriviruses. It is expressed by a ribosomal frameshift and encodes the RdRp, a helicase, and the NendoU endoribonuclease. Arterivirus NendoU is related to the coronavirus protein of the same name and hydrolyzes single- and double-stranded RNA. The exact role of NendoU in the arterivirus replication cycle remains unknown.",

Arteriviruses lack the notable spike proteins of the coronaviruses; in fact the envelope surface is very smooth. There are seven proteins associated with the envelope (GP2, GP3, GP4, M, E, 5a, and GP5). M, E, and 5a are nonglycosylated. GP2, GP3, and GP4 associate for form a heterotrimer. GP5 is a large glycoprotein with three membrane-spanning domains. All of the envelope proteins appear to be required for formation of infectious virions.",

            "text": "The overall replication cycle of the arteriviruses is very similar to that of the coronaviruses. Entry occurs via endocytosis. The infecting genome is translated to produce the polyprotein 1a and polyprotein 1ab products; these are cleaved by viral proteases to generate the nonstructural proteins (nsps). Replication is cytoplasmic and takes place in association with double membrane vesicles. Virions form by budding into membrane vesicles (endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi) and are released by exocytosis. Arterivirus genomes are considerably smaller than coronavirus genomes, but the overlapping ORFs encoding the nsps account for almost \u00be of the total coding capacity (Box 18.1\n).Box 18.1CharacteristicsGenomes are positive-strand RNA, 12.7\u201313.7 kb. Genomes have a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. Proteins required for RNA synthesis and polyprotein processing are encoded in two large overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b that are expressed from genome length RNA. ORF1a and ORF1b encode long polyproteins that are cleaved by viral proteases to generate a set of nonstructural proteins (nsps). ORF1b is expressed via ribosomal frameshifting. Nsps include an endonuclease (NendoU) common to all members of the order Nidovirales.A leader sequence at the 5\u2032 end of the genome is found on all subgenomic mRNAs, supporting a model of discontinuous transcription similar to the coronaviruses. Structural and accessory proteins are encoded from a nested set of 3\u2032 coterminal mRNAs. Genome recombination by a copy choice mechanism is not uncommon.Virions are enveloped, 50\u201360 nm diameter with a helical nucleocapsid. Structural proteins include an RNA-binding nucleoprotein (N) and seven envelope-associated proteins (M, E, 5a, GP2, GP3, GP4, and GP5). GP5 is the major envelope glycoprotein; it spans the envelope three times. None of the envelope-associated proteins have a long ectodomain, thus the surface of the virion is smooth in appearance.",

Many infections are asymptomatic or cause mild upper respiratory tract disease; however, some infections are more severe. An infrequent outcome of infection is abortion in pregnant mares. Some infected stallions become persistent shedders of virus but can be cured of the infection by castration. This indicates a hormonal link (testosterone) to viral persistence although the molecular events associated with persistence have not been determined. During acute infection virus is transmitted via aerosols and the primary sites of replication are in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. The virus also infects macrophages and some lymphocytes thereby moving to regional lymph nodes. Infected cells then disseminate EAV throughout the horse. Virus is present in feces, urine, vaginal secretions, and semen.",

            "text": "PRRS has two distinct clinical presentations: reproductive failure and postweaning respiratory disease. Reproductive disease causes increased numbers of stillborn piglets, mummified fetuses, premature births, and weak piglets. Reproductive problems arise because PRRS can cross the placenta. If the virus crosses the placenta in the third trimester of gestation piglets may be viremic when born, and may transmit virus for 2\u20133 months. The respiratory form of the disease affects piglets, causing pneumonia and respiratory distress. Pneumonia develops because the virus infects alveolar macrophage and the infection is cytopathic. PRRSV may also predispose pigs to secondary infections due to widespread destruction of macrophages. The emergence of PRRSV has resulted in the need for increased biosecurity on pig farms. To avoid introducing the virus into a herd, farmers use strict quarantine measures when introducing new animals. They must also purchase breeding stock and semen that is known to be virus-free. Sanitation of transport vehicles and strict protocols of fomite and personnel movement between farms are also critical components of an effective program.Box 18.2TaxonomyOrder Nidovirales\nFamily Arteriviridae\nGenus Arterivirus (to date contains 13 species isolated from horses, pigs, rats, and monkeys).",

The disease was clinically similar to human hemorrhagic fevers and the mortality was quite high, approaching 100%. Macrophages are the primary target for SHFV and cytolytic infection is probably related to viral pathogenesis. It was long suspected that the natural hosts for SHFV were African monkeys. Recent studies have revealed that in fact many species of wild African monkeys are persistently infected with arteriviruses related to SHFV. However there is a great deal of genetic diversity with viruses from different monkey species sharing only about 50% nucleotide sequence identity. In some areas, up to 40% of monkeys are persistently infected and virus titers in the blood are quite high. Thus it appears that many monkey arteriviruses are quite well adapted to their natural hosts but have the potential to cause severe disease if transmitted to another species.",
