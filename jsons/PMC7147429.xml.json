In all, the virus killed\napproximately 800 people (WHO, 2006) and infected\nmany thousands more. In Canada there were 251 reported cases of SARS and 43 deaths. The\neconomic impact of SARS, though difficult to ascertain due to multiple crises in 2002 and\n2003, is estimated to be in excess of $15 billion worldwide and continues to impact tourism\neven today (SARS, 2003a, b, c).",
