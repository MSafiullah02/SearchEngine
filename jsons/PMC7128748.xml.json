A novel coronavirus was isolated from the sputum of the patient in Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, Holland, therefore, initially it was called the EMC coronavirus. According to a retrospective survey, the earliest MERS cases from Jordan were found at April 2012, which were the first cases of cluster. Both the 2 cases were found in medical staffs and they both died later. Since the sources of all the MERS patients were associated with the Middle East, the WHO in May 2013 named it as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [2], [3].",

However, there is still not very clear about how the medical staff became infected, what the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) they used and how the standard precautions in these hospitals were implemented.

In April 2013, another cluster of 23 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV was detected in Al-Hasa in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Almost all cases were directly linked to person-to-person exposure. Most of them are in the hemodialysis (9 cases) or intensive care (4 cases) units of a same hospital. Two cases are healthcare workers. Three family members of over 200 household contacts (all of whom had visited the hospital) were proven infected [1], [5]. More than 500 cases was reported in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in March and April 2014, the majority represented hospital-based outbreaks in the Saudi Arabian cities of Jeddah (255 cases), Riyadh, Tabuk, and Madinah and in Al Ain City, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and included cases in healthcare workers, patients admitted for other medical problems, visitors, and ambulance staff. 75% of those cases had known sources of exposure. However, there has been no clear evidence of sustained community transmission of MERS-CoV. Of the family members, 7 of 554 were infected (1.3%) [4], [5], [6].",
