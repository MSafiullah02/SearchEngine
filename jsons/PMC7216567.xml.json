To facilitate cellular entry, the spike protein (S) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the ACE2 receptor and is then primed by proteases such as TMPRSS2 and this binding affinity determines the viral load and disease severity. However, other proteases may also be involved [2]. In the eye, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-localise in the corneal epithelium [2]. Conjunctivitis is a rare manifestation [3] and transmission through ocular secretions is also low [4].",

Non-contact tonometry may generate microaerosols [8]. Transmission of respiratory viruses in hospital setting may also be aggravated by inadequate airflow, overcrowding, large temperature differences in rooms and rapid movement of air, which can increase the distance travelled by airborne particles [9].",

Public Health England (PHE) has also included \u201csurgery with high speed devices\u201d as AGPs [11]. Reports on evidence of virus-laden aerosol generation are published with orthopaedic and dental drills, however, there is lack of evidence on AGP properties of intraocular surgical instruments and no evidence of viral transmissibility from ocular or intraocular fluids especially as such instruments are used inside rather than on the surface of the eye [12, 13]. The Royal College of Ophthalmologists with the British Eire Association of Vitreoretinal Surgeons (BEAVRS) and the United Kingdom & Ireland Society of Cataract & Refractive Surgeons [UKISCRS] have issued specific guidelines regarding pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and phacoemulsification procedures that employ instruments with high speed cut rates (phacoemulsification probes, vitrectomy cutters) [14, 15]. The guidance advises for suspension of non-elective surgeries and defines retinal detachment and cataract in the context of retinal detachment or glaucoma as urgent ophthalmic procedures. With due consideration to the unknown risk of infection, and a lack of conclusive evidence, the guidance recommends these procedures are seen as potential AGPs. However, further research is recommended regarding the need of Filtering Face Piece 3 (FFP3) respirators as well as eye protection by surgeons and scrub nurses while performing phacoemulsification cataract surgery and vitrectomy.",

Masks do provide high levels of respiratory protection and for this reason the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the Royal College of Ophthalmologists [RCOphth] and PHE have advised the use of masks when examining and treating all patients. Masks are classified based on filter efficacy and face adhesion: FFP 1, 2 and 3 offer filter efficacy 80%, 94% and 99%, respectively [16]. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory requirement do not address the fit of surgical masks making the total filtration efficiency of questionable value [17]. Gloves, disposable aprons, eye protection, fluid resistant type IIR surgical masks (FRSM) and slit lamp guards are recommended as PPE for all ophthalmic clinic assessment and outpatient procedures (e.g. intravitreal injections) by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists [18]. This guidance is compliant with PHE recommendations for use of PPE [11]. For potential AGPs, the PHE and RCOphth guidance advises consideration of the use of single use FPP respirator, fluid resistant gown, gloves and eye protection. For high risk acute areas such as operation theatres where AGPs are performed and high dependency unit where ophthalmology review may be required, use of gloves plastic apron and FRSM with eye protection is recommended. The PHE recommends use of masks for all patients attending outpatient clinics and using communal waiting areas.",

Although hospital settings are the most common sites for secondary transmission of SARS and MERS virus, it is not the case for COVID 19 and considerable transmission occur through close contacts [23]. The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals performed 1666 SARS-CoV-2 tests in 1654 staff between 10 and 31 March 2020. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 240 (14%) tests. To further explore the occupational role affected, staff were divided into three groups\u2014direct patient facing roles, non-patient facing roles but potentially high risk and non-clinical roles. Most staff were in group 1 (834 [81%] of 1029), with a minority in groups 2 (86 [8%]) or 3 (109 [11%]). However, comparison yielded no significant difference in rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the groups. They concluded that nosocomial infection from patients to staff was not an important factor\u2014community spread played a larger role in transmission. Another important outcome from the testing protocol was that a large number of employees (1414) were able to return to work quickly even in direct patient facing roles. However, the limitations of the study were testing of a smaller cohort of non-clinical staff, lack of data on symptomatology and use of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp assay which has low sensitivity [24].",
