In 1882, Robert Koch first isolated Mycobacterium, stained with alkaline methylene blue and vesuvin and established its etiologic relationship with tuberculosis. Koch described that the same human or bovine type Mycobacterium may cause avian tuberculosis. Strauss and Gamaleia (1891) and Maffucci (1892) cited in Cobbett (1917) illustrated that the etiological Mycobacterium of avian tuberculosis was different from human or bovine type. Hinshaw (1933) and Ackermann et al. (1974) reported occurrence of tuberculosis in Amazon parrot (Amazona farinosa). Coyle et al. (1992) proposed a new Mycobacterial species (Mycobacterium genavense) isolated from human patients with AIDS. Simultaneously in 1993, Mycobacterium genavense was reported from pet birds in Europe (Hoop et al. 1993 ). Mycobacterium is gram positive, straight or slightly curved rod with occasional coccobacillary, club and branched form. In the tissues, it measures 1-4 \u00b5m in length and 0.2-0.3 \u00b5m in width. It occurs singly, in pair or in bundle. It is difficult to demonstrate their gram positive nature due to high lipid content of the cell wall. The stains are relatively impermeable to the bacterial cell. They can be easily stained by Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) or acid fast staining technique.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 498, "end": 525, "text": "Strauss and Gamaleia (1891)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 555, "end": 569, "text": "Cobbett (1917)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 680, "end": 694, "text": "Hinshaw (1933)", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 699, "end": 722, "text": "Ackermann et al.

After transmission, infection starts with the attachment of elementary bodies to the host cell membrane.

In C. psittaci infection, IncB proteins (T3SS-effector protein) interact with host cell proteins (dynein motor proteins) for intracellular transport of vesicles with EBs into the nuclear zone. The EB is converted into reticulate bodies (RB) in this nuclear zone. The EB loses its electron dense DNA core and its cell wall loses its rigidity due to break of disulphide bridges. The reticulate bodies are non-infectious form, larger in size (500-2000 nm diameter) and metabolically active. RBs multiply by binary fission and start genus specific protein synthesis. The structural reorientation started and RBs are transformed into intermediate bodies (IB, 300-1000 nm in diameter). A central electron-dense core with radially arranged nucleoid fibres surrounding the core is observed in the IBs. The IBs are converted into progeny EBs within a vesicle after 30 h of the entry of initial EBs. Chlamydial micro colony with 100-500 EBs within the vesicle is called 'inclusion body' and it is generated after 48-50 h. The inclusion bodies move to the golgi apparatus region with the help of host dynein proteins. EB is released to attack new cells by rupturing the vesicles and the cycle is repeated. The signal for release of EBs is yet unknown but it is associated with host cellular apoptosis. Suppression of host cellular apoptosis can induce persistent Chlamydial infection. Intracellular survival of EBs depends on escape from the lysosomal breakdown process. The EBs can induce delayed maturation of lysosomes as an escape mechanism. The intracellular inclusion bodies are covered with a mesh of host cytoskeletal filaments which prevent the exit of the content and consequent activation of the host immune system. Close attachment of C. psittaci inclusions with the mitochondria helps in acquisition of ATP because they cannot synthesize it.

Captive birds kept in small and dirty cages are more susceptible to parasitic infestations. Capability of a parasite to survive and reproduce in pet birds ('parasite fitness') depends on host immunity and nutrients for parasite available in the host body. The parasites may avoid the birds with good health condition due to strong immune response, but the parasites also avoid the birds with very poor health due to less possibility to obtain nutrients. The balance between immunity and nutrient availability is crucial for selection of host by the parasites. Cockatoos, cockatiels, grey parrots can get the protozoon by the ingestion of insects with sarcocysts. Three clinical forms such as acute pulmonary form, muscular form, and neurologic forms are observed in birds. In acute form, death without development of sarcocysts in the muscle occurs. In other two forms, clinical signs for instance dullness, weakness, respiratory signs, yellow urates are detected. Pulmonary hemorrhage and edema are the cause of death. Presence of sarcocysts in muscles of heart, breast, thigh, neck, and esophagus is the major lesion. Hepatosplenomegaly, lung consolidation, pulmonary edema are also observed. Diagnosis is usually based on visualization of sarcocysts in the muscles after post-mortem. Ante-mortem diagnosis is possible by muscle biopsy, indirect immunofluorescent assay and PCR.

However, repeated isolation from the clinical specimen is required, along with correlation with history, clinical signs, histopathological observations for proper diagnosis of clinical aspergillosis. (d) Blood biochemical tests and radiography: Haematological parameters such as leukocytosis (20,000-100,000), heterophilia with a left shift (degenerative shift), monocytosis, lymphopenia, and change in b-globulin concentration indicate about occurrence of infection such as aspergillosis. Radiographic changes of pneumonia and airsacculitis (lateral and ventrodorsal views) also suggests respiratory tract infection such as aspergillosis. Both these biochemical tests and radiogrpahy cannot confirm the infection. (e) Detection of Aspergillus antigen: Detection of Aspergillus antigen is useful in acute infection. Galactomannan (GM) is the predominant antigen released by A. fumigatus in the circulation during angioinvasion which can be detected by latex agglutination test, sandwich ELISA in blood samples. The detection limit of both the tests is 15 ng/ml and 1 ng/ml, respectively. However, GM detection assay is not specific for Aspergillus as it is cross-reacting with other fungi such as Penicillium, Fusarium, Alternaria, and Histoplasma. Similarly, b-D-glucan (BDG) can be detected for identification of Aspergillus. It is also produced by a lot of other fungi such as Candida, Fusarium, Pneumocystis etc. So the test can predict the general fungal infection rather than specifically aspergillosis. (f) Serological tests: Serological tests such as counter-immunoelectrophoresis, agar gel immunodiffusion and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) can be employed as supportive diagnostic assays to detect the antibodies in chronic infection. In immunosuppressed birds production of antibody is undetectable. (g) Molecular biology: Confirmation of Aspergillus spp. can be done by conventional PCR and real-time PCR from clinical samples.

Antifungals used in avian aspergillosis with suitable dosage are described in Table 2 .18. Sometimes, immunostimulants, for example, levamisole and microbial products (b-glucans) can be used for boosting of the immune system. No vaccine is currently available against avian aspergillosis.

Candida albicans, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis are major cause of avian candidiasis. C. parapsilosis is rarely isolated from the crops of the birds. Among the pet birds, clinical candidiasis is reported from peach-faced lovebirds, Fisher's lovebirds, pigeons, cockatiels, Amazon parakeets, budgerigars and peacocks. In Eclectus parrot, concomitant infection of histoplasmosis and candidiasis is detected. Healthy cockatiels and some other psittacines are also detected to act as carrier of Candida spp. Infected birds show whitish, pseudomembranous lesions in oral cavity, crop and esophagus. Crop is the most suitable organ for fungal growth due to its pouch like structure and availability of nutrients. General symptoms such as anorexia, depression, delayed crop emptying, and regurgitation is sometimes observed. Presence of thickened mucosa (pseudomembranes) and ulcers in oral cavity, esophagus and crop is the major necropsy findings. The smear prepared from the clinical specimens can be observed under microscope either by 10% KOH preparation or by staining with Gram's stain method. In the tissue section Candida can be observed by PAS-haematoxylin or methenamine silver stain. They appear as unicellular budding yeast or hyphae and pseudohyphae ( Fig. 2.54 ). Candida can be isolated in common fungal or bacteriological media such as Sabouraud dextrose Agar (with penicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol to prevent the bacterial growth), potato dextrose agar, blood agar and brain heart infusion agar.

Due to presence of a eukaryotic nucleus, mycotic staining properties, presence of chitin in cell wall, and finally phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rRNA and 26S rRNA gene, Megabacterium is classified as yeast. It is renamed as Macrorhabdus ornithogaster. The infection is reported from captive-bred budgerigars (Melopsitticus undulatus), parrotlets (Forpus spp.), canaries (Serinus canaria), pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa), helmeted guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) and gray partridges (Perdix perdix) as primary pathogen or concomitant with other infections. Faecal-oral route is the probable transmission route of Macrorhabdus infection in birds. The yeast prefers to colonize isthmus of proventriculus or ventriculus in birds. The infection is chronic and it produces certain non-specific symptoms such as anorexia, continuous loss of body weight, depression, plumage disorder, regurgitation, diarrhoea and dehydration ( Fig. 2.55 ). Sudden death due to rupture of proventriculus is observed in budgerigars and parrots. Swollen and hyperemic proventriculus, covering of isthmus with thick, transparent-to-white mucus, and mucosal erosions in gizzard are specific necropsy findings. Fresh faecal samples from live birds and tissues from vital organs (esophagus, crop, proventriculus, gizzard, pancreas, liver etc.) can be collected in 10% buffered formalin after post-mortem. Smears prepared from faecal samples can be stained by Gram's method.

Detection of typical gram-positive, large rod shaped organisms (20-60 \u00b5m long and 2-3 \u00b5m wide) suggests Macrorhabdus infection (Fig. 2.56) . Isolation of Macrorhabdus is difficult because it does not grow in commonly used solid media. It can be isolated only in liquid medium (minimum essential media) with 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5% sucrose and more than two weeks incubation.
