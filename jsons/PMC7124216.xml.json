            "text": "In recent years emerging infectious diseases, such as the avian influenza, the 2009 swine flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have rapidly caused many infected cases in humans, negatively affecting human life and the economy. For example, SARS led to an immediate economic loss of close to 2% of the GDP for the East Asian region in the second quarter of 2003 (Brahmbhatt, 2005). Avian influenza virus H5N1 is a potentially serious pandemic threat to the human population (Ferguson et al., 2005). H5N1 may transform into a new human influenza virus through genetic reassortment, and develop the ability for increased and sustained transmission between humans (Capua and Alexander, 2002), possibly being as virulent as it is in the avian population. Most people are easily infected with this new type of influenza because they possibly have no immunity to the emerging disease. In addition, there is no vaccine available that provides effective protection against infection once the disease appears (Ligon, 2005), thereby resulting in a serious pandemic and then obstructing social and economic activities worldwide. Over the past decades, there have been a few influenza pandemics that spread over the entire globe. The most noted influenza pandemic was the one beginning in 1918 with a mortality rate that resulted in the death of possibly 50 million people worldwide (Ligon, 2005). Influenza pandemics are a serious health threat. It is critical that one understands how an emerging influenza spreads, how to predict the result of a pandemic, and how to design control measures to mitigate the impacts of the disease.",

Another study also indicated a high rate of transmission of SARS on aircraft (Olsen et al., 2003). These findings show that air travel facilitates the spread of infectious diseases. Although the influence of air travel has been observed in empirical work, past studies that developed mathematical epidemic models have rarely explored this topic, particularly for an emerging influenza. The aim of this study is to help close this gap in the literature.",

We focused on the human-to-human transmission of influenza, and analyzed the effects of air travel activities, including passengers\u2019 consolidation, conveyance and distribution in airports and flights, on the influenza pandemic. The purpose of this paper is to develop dynamic transmission models to illustrate the transmission behaviors of the influenza virus in scheduled flights and airport terminals. For the realism of our models, links of the network were weighted by the flying time and the number of passengers, and different values of the infection parameters were designed for flights and airports. We also attempted to investigate how the influenza spreads to different geographic regions based on the connectivity properties of the small-world network. In order to provide helpful insights, the proposed models were further used to assess the expected burden of the influenza pandemic in the absence of control measures, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of performing the control measures proposed by the present study.",

For example, Ferguson et al. (2005) modeled the spread of a pandemic in Thailand by incorporating random contacts associated with day-to-day movements to work within the country, and then evaluated the potential effectiveness of containment strategies. In addition, numerous studies have proposed mathematical epidemic models to evaluate and describe the dynamic evolution and the severity of epidemics in the population (e.g. Allen and Burgin, 2000, Colizza et al., 2006, Colizza et al., 2007, Massad et al., 2005, M\u00e9ndez and Fort, 2000), as well as in small-world networks following the work of Watts and Strogatz (1998) (e.g. Kuperman and Abramson, 2001, Saram\u00e4ki and Kaski, 2005, Small and Tse, 2005). For example, Colizza et al., 2006, Colizza et al., 2007 developed a metapopulation stochastic epidemic model on a global scale, and used a stochastic transport operator to describe the dynamics of individuals based on travels between cities. They concluded that a cooperative strategy where countries with large antiviral stockpiles share a part of their resources with other countries results in a global deceleration of the pandemics. However, our study focuses on exploring the influences of air travel activities (i.e. passenger consolidation, conveyance and distribution) and small-world properties of an air transportation network on the spatiotemporal evolution of an influenza pandemic. Few of the previous studies have discussed these issues in detail.",

            "text": "Based on the operating procedures of a flight, the sub-model for transmission occurring during a flight is further divided into three stages, departure from its origin airport (i.e. passenger consolidation), en route flying (i.e. passenger conveyance), and arrival at its destination airport (i.e. passenger distribution). Let us denote I\nj(t) as the number of infected individuals on flight j (\u2208E) at time t, and denote t\nj as the time on which flight j departs from its origin airport. This study initially investigates the sources of infected individuals of a specific departure flight, one part coming from the upstream flights of the flight, and the other coming from the airport of origin of the flight. Therefore, the initial number of infected individuals on flight j at time t\nj, Ijo, is defined by Eq. (1):(1)Ijo\u2261Ij(tj)=\u2211j\u2032\u2208Uj\u03b1jj\u2032\u22c5Ij\u2032f+Zj(tj)where subscript j\u2032 represents one of the upstream flights connectable to flight j at the origin airport of flight j, and the set of upstream flights of flight j is denoted as U\nj; Ij\u2032f is the number of infected individuals on flight j\u2032 when the flight arrives at its destination airport (i.e. the origin airport of flight j); \u03b1jj\u2032 is the proportion of infected individuals on flight j\u2032 who transfer to flight j; and Z\nj(t\nj)is the number of infected individuals who board the airplane from the origin airport of flight j at time t\nj. The characteristics and the complexity of land transportation system differ from those of the air transportation system. So, this study uses Z\nj(t\nj) to represent those infected individuals from the exterior community of airports, or those individuals from the exterior community who are infected within airports. It should be noted that Ijo is not greater than the total number of passengers of flight j, N\nj. In addition, the second term of Eq. (1) is determined by Eq. (2):(2)Zj(t)=\u03bdj\u22c5Yjo(t)where subscript j\no(\u2208V) represents the origin airport of flight j; Yjo(t) is the cumulative number of infected individuals in the restricted areas of airport j\no at time t, and Yjo(t)\u22650; and \u03bd\nj is the proportion of Yjo(t) who board flight j, and 0 < \n\u03bd\nj\n < 1. Eq. (2) implies that when the cumulative number of infected individuals at a specific airport increases, the possibility that a boarding passenger is an infected individual increases, thereby increasing the expected number of infected individuals who board the airplane at the airport.",

            "text": "After flight j departs, i.e. en route, the infected individuals will transmit the influenza to susceptible individuals in the cabin of the flight. Let S\nj(t) denote the number of susceptible individuals in flight j at time t, and \u03b2 denote the infection parameter, i.e. the average number of contacts that lead to infection per infected individual per susceptible individual per unit of time. Based on Daley and Gani (1999), the transmission model en route can be formulated as Eq. (3):(3)dIj(t)dt=\u03b2Sj(t)Ij(t)where the right-hand side of the equation is the number of new infected individuals per unit of time in the airplane. Furthermore, since the total population size of flight j is always N\nj, i.e. it is a closed population, and since all individuals are either susceptible or infected, the equation S\nj(t) + \nI\nj(t) = \nN\nj. In Eq. (3), S\nj(t) can then be replaced by N\n \nj\u2212 \nI\nj(t), and Eq. (3) can be easily solved by separation of variables, leading to the exact solution of I\nj(t):(4)Ij(t)=IjoNj(Nj\u2212Ijo)\u22c5exp(\u03b2Nj(tj\u2212t))+Ijowhere Ijo, as defined in Eq. (1), is the initial number of infected individuals of flight j when the flight departs at time t\nj, and is composed of the infected individuals coming from the upstream flights and from the origin airport. Eq. (4) shows that, as the elapsed time for flying increases, resulting in a longer duration during which susceptible individuals are more likely to be exposed to infected ones, the expected number of infected individuals increases. Furthermore, in the case where the flight arrives at its destination airport, let's denote F\nj as the total elapsed flying time of flight j, and t\u00afj as the time flight j arrives at its destination airport, i.e. t\u00afj=tj+Fj. Then at time t\u00afj, the final total number of infected individuals in the cabin of flight j, Ijf, is as follows:(5)Ijf\u2261Ij(t\u00afj)=IjoNj(Nj\u2212Ijo)\u22c5exp\u2212\u03b2NjFj+Ijo\n",

The small-world properties improve the connectivity efficiency of the airline network in two aspects. One is that the properties shorten passengers\u2019 travel time by introducing several inter-regional or inter-continental routes that mimic the function of shortcuts in a small-world network. They enable passengers to fly between airports that are located at different regions in an efficient way. The other is that the properties expand the destinations that passengers can reach by scheduled flights, i.e. passengers can further transfer to downstream flights in order to fly to other regions around the globe after they arrive at connecting airports. Nevertheless, the improved connectivity of the airline network contributed by the small-world properties also speeds up the transmission of the influenza in the network. In the absence of inter-regional routes, the infected individuals have a longer travel time for arriving at their destination airports, thereby slowing down the transmission of the influenza to these airports. However, by introducing the inter-regional routes, the flying time of infected individuals, F\nj, can be substantially shortened. This makes the arrival time, t\u00afj, earlier than before, and as shown in Eq. (8), advances the time at which Xjd(t)>0, i.e. the influenza is transmitted more rapidly to the destination airports. It further makes I(t) of the transmission model in Eq. (10) increase more quickly. On the other hand, although the small-world properties expand the number of destinations that passengers can reach, the fact that the destination airports of flights are different from one another enables the infected individuals to spread the influenza to various regions worldwide via flights. In other words, the improved connectivity contributed by small-world properties expands the geographic scope of transmission, i.e. H(t) in Eq. (11).",

This study further designs a control measure to be carried out in airports to constrain the transmission of influenza and reduce its impacts. The control measure is that, the customs and public health officers must inspect all departure passengers at the entrances of restricted areas by such methods as temperature screening. Passengers will be quarantined as soon as their influenza symptoms are identified. This control measure will effectively reduce the possibility that infected individuals will board flights. That is, it decreases the initial number of infected individuals on flights at the departure time, Ijo, and consequently, as shown in Eq.

We compare the total number of passengers of all airports according to the statistics published by Airports Council International (ACI).2\nAnd then, for the airport that has the greatest number of passengers we take \u03c1jd=0.085 (per infected individual per hour).

With other words, we will focus on the pattern of transmission generated by flights whose destinations are the top 50 airports.

As a result, we further investigate the transmission pattern in a situation where the control measures cannot be carried out synchronously for all airports. In the network, such large airports as the top 50 airports have a higher level of network connectivity, but there are fewer large than small airports. So, practicing the control measures at large or small airports may receive different priorities and thereby obtain different containment results. In order to determine which set of priorities results in better containment effectiveness, this study designs various strategies to give different priorities of execution for the control measures based on the size of the airports. Strategies practiced in this study are shown in Table 1\n, and are described as follows. Strategy 1 stipulates that all airports synchronously carry out the control measures after day 30. Strategy 2 stipulates that the top 50 airports first carry out the control measures after day 30, while other airports execute measures with some time delay due to the constraint of limited resources. It is assumed that these airports will start their control measures 5 days later, i.e. day 35. Contrary to Strategy 2, Strategy 3 stipulates that those airports excluded from the top 50 first carry out control measures after day 30, but that the top 50 airports start executing the control measures after day 35 due to different concerns at various sizes of airports. The results are shown in Fig. 4\n, indicating that Strategy 1 is the most effective approach for containing the influenza transmission and the pandemic. In addition, Strategy 2 is the second most effective approach with a transmission pattern that is slightly higher than that of Strategy 1. This observation may be helpful in providing an insight to public health authorities, particularly when practicing control measures with limited resources. Compared to Strategy 2, we also run the simulations for carrying out control measures at the top 10, top 20, top 30 airports and so on, and finally at the top 100 airports. The results show that the transmission pattern gradually decreases as the top number increases from 10 to 100. However, as the top number increases over 50, the decrement of the transmission pattern is slight and limited. So 50 can be regarded as a critical number for the choice of the top number of airports in the practice of control measures.",

            "text": "The result of the simulation shows that after day 13, the influenza has spread to two or more airports worldwide, indicating a global outbreak (i.e. a pandemic) appearing in the network. So, we then attempt to start practicing three different strategies after day 13, which give different priorities in executing the control measures according to the size of the airports. This allows us to assess their containment effectiveness and to examine which set of priorities is better for containing the transmission. The different strategies are shown in Table 1, and are described as follows. Strategy 4 stipulates that all airports must synchronously carry out the control measures after day 13. Strategy 5 stipulates that the top 50 airports must first carry out control measures after day 13, and then the other airports start to execute the control measures with 5 days delay, i.e. on day 18. Contrary to Strategy 5, Strategy 6 stipulates that those airports excluded from the top 50 must start the control measures after day 13, while the top 50 airports execute the control measures after day 18. Fig. 5\nshows that the influenza pandemic is mitigated more markedly than Fig. 4, and Strategy 4 results in the highest effectiveness among all the strategies for containing the pandemic. However, under the constraint of limited resources, Strategy 5 can also result in remarkable containment effectiveness. Comparing the results of Fig. 4, Fig. 5 indicate that one should carry out control measures as soon as the pandemic appears so that the transmission can be effectively mitigated.",

It shows that the scale of the pandemic increases as the infectiousness increases. At the same time, we also analyzed the start time that the influenza pandemic appears under various levels of infectiousness as shown in Fig. 7\n. It shows that the start time of the influenza pandemic will be moved ahead from day 13 to day 3 if the level of infectiousness increases.

Empirical investigations have found that air travel facilitates the spread of infectious diseases. However, past studies of mathematical epidemic models have not yet incorporated the effects of air travel on influenza transmission. This paper focused on the human-to-human transmission of influenza, and investigated the effects of air travel activities (passengers\u2019 consolidation, conveyance and distribution in airports and flights) on the influenza pandemic in a small-world network. Dynamic transmission models were developed not only to illustrate the transmission behaviors of the influenza en route scheduled flights and in airport terminals, but also to assess the expected burdens of the pandemic with and without control measures. This study also investigated how the small-world properties of the airline network facilitate the spread of influenza over all parts of the globe.",

Those flights to the top 50 airports spread the disease more quickly than the same number of flights to all airports. Our findings suggest that the public health authorities should avoid the influenza being spread to the top 50 airports in order to mitigate the impacts of the influenza. Under the constraint of limited resources, control at the top 50 airports first is almost as effective as control at all airports, and control sooner is more effective than control later. The findings may be helpful in providing insights for public health authorities to set priorities. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that as the infectiousness of the influenza increases, the disease spreads more quickly, and the start time of the pandemic is earlier. This means that, once the influenza increases in strength or becomes stronger than expected, the authorities should move the start of the control measures ahead accordingly in order to effectively control the pandemic. However, control measures at larger airports, such as the top 50 airports, are more expensive than at smaller airports. One could consider involving the cost of control measures and its effects for future research.",
