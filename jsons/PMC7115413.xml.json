            "text": "Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) that allows for the simultaneous administration of multiple drugs is currently the standard treatment for HIV infection. The drug combinations used in this setting normally consist of several inhibitors that target different enzymes in the viral life-cycle, including reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase. Although HAART can dramatically decrease the levels of morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection, the emergence of drug resistance is usually unavoidable because of the high mutation and rapid replication rates of the virus. The sequential administration of different drugs is therefore required for the treatment of HIV infection, as well as the development of new targeted therapies [1]. Enfuvirtide (ENF) is an important choice for the treatment of patients who have not responded well to HAART. In contrast to traditional small-molecule enzyme inhibitors, ENF is a 36-residue peptide that binds to the viral envelope gp41 protein and inhibits the gp41-mediated membrane fusion between the virus and the host-cell, which is an essential step for the delivery of the viral genome into the cell [2]. ENF has been successfully used in clinic practice to control HIV infection and transmission. However, as is the case with many peptide and protein drugs [3], ENF exhibits poor aqueous solubility and can be rapidly removed from systemic circulation through metabolic pathways and immune response systems. To maintain an efficacious concentration, ENF must be administered twice daily at a high dosage (90 mg) by subcutaneous injections. Furthermore, ENF therapy must be implemented consistently over an extended period of time because of the chronic nature of HIV infection [4], which can lead to severe injection-site reactions [5]. ENF treatment is therefore inconvenient to the patient and represents an expensive regimen for the health care provider, and these factors have severely limited its application in the clinic.",

            "text": "A number of different approaches have been developed to address the pharmacokinetic problems associated with ENF and several other peptide analogues, which can inhibit HIV fusion in a similar manner. Peptide engineering strategies, such as the incorporation of salt bridges, can lead to increases in the in vivo stability of a peptide sequence, which can result in extended half-lives [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. The chemical modification of a peptide with a synthetic or natural molecule, such as cholesterol [11] or albumin [12], [13], can also lead to a reduction in its immunogenicity and proteolysis [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugation is a commonly used method for improving the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic peptides and proteins [21], [22], [23], and this method has been applied to a peptide inhibitor of HIV fusion that overlaps ENF by 33 residues [19]. The PEGylated peptide showed a 3.4-fold increase in the half-life against tryptic degradation, although there was a slight decrease in the fusion-inhibitory potency when compared with the unmodified peptide. Despite the positive results reported in this study for the PEGylation of the inhibitor, there have been no reports in the literature to date pertaining to the antiviral activity or the pharmacokinetic properties of a fusion inhibitor conjugated with PEG.",

In a similar manner to PEGylation, the glycosylation of peptides and proteins leads to an increase in their molecular size and steric bulk, which can have a significant impact on their biophysical and physiological properties. However, current techniques for the construction of glycopeptides and glycoproteins are quite challenging. Recombinant expression systems allow for the rapid and large-scale production of glycopeptides and glycoproteins, but these systems provided only limited control over the glycosylation step [24]. Chemical and chemoenzymatic syntheses can produce structurally well-defined molecules [25], [26], but generally require multiple steps and tedious purification procedures that can result in low production yields, thereby limiting their practical application.",

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments showed that all the conjugates strongly bound to N46 with affinities (K\nd) in the range of 307\u20131410 nM (Fig. 2\n). Although the affinities of the conjugates were lower than that of ENF (182 nM), we observed a general trend towards increasing affinity as the MW of the PEG portion of the conjugate decreased. Particularly, the PEG2k-ENF demonstrated an affinity (307 nM) approximating to that of ENF. In contrast, none of the EP conjugates or ENF bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA), confirming that the observed interactions were specific for peptide N46. The SPR experiments measured the binding of ENF or EP conjugates to the chip-immobilized N46, and the assay condition did not exactly match with the membrane environment necessary for the fusion inhibition. However, the potent interaction between EP conjugates and N46 confirmed in this assay suggested that the attached PEG had no significant impact on the intrinsic binding affinity of ENF.",

ENF lacks a defined structure in solution, where it has a low \u03b1-helicity. In contrast, N46 adopts a typical \u03b1-helical conformation in solution, and its \u03b1-helicity is reduced dramatically upon its binding to ENF. The ENF and EP conjugates prepared in this study were analyzed by circular dichroism (CD), and the results revealed that the low \u03b1-helical content of ENF was further decreased by the attached PEG in a MW-dependent manner (Fig. 3\nA). Interestingly, all of the conjugates interacted with N46 to form stable \u03b1-helical complexes, which had markedly higher \u03b1-helicities than that of N46 alone or in complex with ENF (Fig. 3B). This result is, however, inconsistent with the affinity of the conjugates for N46 which is obviously lower than that of ENF, as the \u03b1-helicity of binding complexes is positively correlated to their stability [28], [29]. The apparent contradiction between the affinity and the \u03b1-helicity likely resulted from the different assay formats. Unlike the chip-based SPR assay in which N46 was immobilized on a solid surface, in CD experiment free N46 and the EP conjugate in solution were able to partake in a dynamic binding process that allowed the attached PEG to interact with the binding complex and the aqueous medium. The mechanism of the improvement in the \u03b1-helicity of the complex following PEGylation has not yet been determined. However, the ability of the attached PEG to form an amphiphilic shell capable of stabilizing the coiled-coil peptide core under aqueous conditions [36], [37], [38], may provide some evidence in support of our results.",

The replication of the virus in TZM-bl cells [39] was measured in the presence of the conjugates, with ENF as a control (Table 1\n). ENF and all of the conjugates inhibited the replication of HIV at nanomolar concentrations, with no cytotoxicity observed below the micromolar range (CC50 > 100 \u03bcM), as determined using an XTT assay [41]. The two conjugates bearing the smaller PEG (2 kDa) showed higher activities than their 5 kDa counterparts. The N-terminally PEGylated peptides showed much greater activity than their C-terminal congeners, with the PEG2k-ENF exhibiting the highest inhibitory activity of all the conjugates. Notably, the EC50 value of PEG2k-ENF (4 nM) was comparable to that of ENF (3 nM). The chemical modification at the C-terminus of ENF has an adverse impact on its antiviral activity [11], [12], [20], because the lipophilic residues (WNWF) in this region are required for the anchoring of the peptide into the membrane interface where the fusion occurs [28], [29]. Our data were therefore in agreement with these earlier findings and revealed that the attachment of PEG2k to the N-terminus of ENF did not lead to a significant decrease in its antiviral efficacy.",

The calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters using the well-established non-compartmental method [44] revealed that the conjugate had an elimination half-life [45] (T\n1/2) which was over 10-fold longer than that of ENF. The overall pharmacokinetic profile of PEG2k-ENF was also superior to that of ENF, with marked increases in the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), apparent volume of distribution (V\nd), and mean residence time (MRT), as well as a marked decrease in systematic clearance rate (CL).

The coupling of cENF to mPEG-MAL through a concise thiol-maleimide reaction allowed for the large-scale synthesis of the EP conjugate, which could be important for clinical applications that require a sufficient supply of material. The EP conjugate exhibited much better aqueous solubility and in vivo half-life than ENF, which could lead to less-frequent dosing regimens and a reduction in adverse injection-site reactions. In addition, the EP conjugate displayed potent inhibitory activity towards the most common primary HIV strains circulating in China, further highlighting its potential as an effective and long-acting inhibitor of HIV fusion. It is noteworthy that a number of other enveloped viruses, including Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), have similar mechanisms of virus\u2212cell fusion to that observed in HIV infection. With this in mind, it is envisaged that the peptide inhibitors currently under investigation against these viruses [50], [51], [52], [53] could also be subjected to the PEGylation approach described in this study.",

The sources of HIV-1SF33 and TZM-bl, as well as the methods used for their preservation and passage have been described previously [20], [41]. The clinical isolates of HIV-1 subtypes B\u2032, BC, and AE were obtained from treatment-naive patients and stored at our laboratory in Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention [46], [47]. These viruses represent the predominant strains circulating in China from 2005 to 2008. Sprague-Dawley rats (male, 7 weeks old, and 150\u2013180 g) were purchased from Beijing HFK Bioscience (Beijing, China) and fed for 2 days before being used for pharmacokinetic analysis. mPEG-MAL (2 and 5 kDa) was purchased from Beijing Kaizheng Biotech Development (Beijing, China). All of the other chemicals used in this study were purchased as the analytical grade from various commercial sources. HPLC analyses were performed on an Agilent 1200 system (Agilent, USA) equipped with a UV detector. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker BIFLEX III spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). All experiments with the viruses were performed in an approved biosafety level (BSL-3) containment laboratory.",
