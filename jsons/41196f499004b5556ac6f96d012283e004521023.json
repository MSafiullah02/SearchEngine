            "text": "A procedure was developed to generate recombinant single chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragments reacting with the extracellular domain of human cell surface antigen CD13 (hCD13; aminopeptidase N) on intact cells. Membrane fractions prepared from a stably transfected hCD13-positive murine NIH / 3T3 cell line were used to immunize BALB / c mice, with the intention that hCD13 would be the major immunogenic molecule recognized by the immune system. Spleen RNA from the immunized mice served to generate a combinatorial scFv phage display library. The library was adsorbed against non-transfected NIH / 3T3 or Sf21 insect cells to eliminate nonrelevant binders. The supernatant was then used for panning with either hCD13-transfected Sf21 insect cells or a hCD13-expressing human leukemia-derived cell line. Therefore, the key concepts of the procedure were the presentation of hCD13 as the sole human antigen on murine NIH / 3T3 cells and a screening strategy where hCD13 was the major common antigen of the material used for immunization and panning. Two different hCD13-reactive phages were isolated and the soluble scFvs were expressed in E. coli and purified. The two scFvs, anti-hCD13-1 and anti-hCD13-3, differed at four amino acid positions in their V regions and both had high affinities for H 210 hCD13 as determined by surface plasmon resonance (K 57 and 33310 M, respectively). Both efficiently recognized D hCD13 on intact cells. Therefore, the procedure allowed the production of high affinity scFvs reacting with a desired antigen in its native conformation without requiring extensive purification of the antigen and should be useful for the preparation of scFvs against other conformation-sensitive cell-surface antigens.",

Therefore, to determine molecular binding constants for scFvs anti-hCD13-1 and anti-hCD13-3, it was necessary to generate the antigen in its native conformation and in a pure state. To achieve these objectives, the antigen was fused to the Fc-domain of a human IgG1 antibody, since this procedure was known to generate soluble antigens in a native conformation (M. Peipp, unpublished data). In this procedure, chimeric molecules are secreted from mammalian cells and receive the post-translational modifications (e.g. glycosylation) characteristic of mammalian cells. For the purpose of secretion, sequences coding for a leader peptide from a murine immunoglobulin k light chain were fused to the coding sequences for the extracellular domain of hCD13 (Fig. 6A) . For the purpose of high level expression, 293T cells were transiently transfected with the construct and soluble human CD13 (s-hCD13) was then produced in high quantities for several days after transfection. The chimeric protein was collected from the culture supernatant and purified by affinity chromatography on a protein A agarose column. Using this procedure, typically 50-100 mg of the recombinant protein were recovered from 1 l of culture supernatant. The chimeric molecule reacted on a Western blot with an antibody against the Fc-portion (Fig. 6B ), and no contaminants or breakdown products were visible by staining with Coomassie blue (Fig. 6C ). The material reacted in an ELISA with the commercial anti-hCD13 (WM-47) antibody, as well as with the two isolated scFvs (data not shown). Thus, the integrity of the antigenic epitope in the chimeric s-hCD13 molecule resembled that on intact cells and this The soluble chimeric ligand s-hCD13 was de- posited on a Biacore CM5 sensor chip and chemical-hCD13-3 (Fig. 7) . Each scFv was also injected over ly coupled by standard procedures.

The procedure delivered scFvs reacting with hCD13 in its native state on the surface of intact cells with high affinity and without requiring an extensive purification of the antigen. The principle components and distinctive features of the procedure were the following: (a) the establishment of stably transfected NIH / 3T3 mouse and Sf21 insect cell lines expressing high levels of hCD13 on their cell surface; (b) the purification of membranes from NIH / 3T3 mouse cells expressing hCD13 by gentle extraction that maintained the antigen in a native state; (c) the immunization of mice with membranes containing hCD13 as the sole human antigen; (d) the preadsorption of the phage display library with nontransfected NIH / 3T3 or Sf21 cells that allowed the removal of antibodies against alloantigens, as well as non-specific proteins; and (e) panning the pre-adsorbed library with hCD13-expressing human Other related methods producing scFvs against plasmon resonance.
