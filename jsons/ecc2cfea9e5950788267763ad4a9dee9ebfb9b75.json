Experiments were carried out on BALB/c mice weighing 8-10 g (aged 4-5 weeks), which were infected with a pathogenic strain of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (HONI) in a dose of 7 log EID~o/0.2 ml.

On the 5th day after infection the quantity of virus in the animals' brain was very small, and on average, based on the results of three experiments, it was I log EIDso/0.2 ml. The presence of influenza virus at this time was confirmed by the results of electron-microscopic investigations, which showed the presence of virions in the cytoplasm of the ependymo- cytes, and, in particular, in the ependymal cells of the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricles. The virions were spherical in shape, about i00 nm in diameter, and consisted of a dense core and very thin fibrils bordering it. In their structural organization they resembled the coated vesicles, which are ordinary cytoplasmic components of the body cells. According to our own observations, coated vesicles differ from virions of influenza virus in their larger size and their clearly defined surface membrane (Fig, I) . Virions are distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the ependymocytes --from its surface as far as the nuclear membrane in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, close to the Golgi complex and mitochondria (Fig. 2) . The ultrastructure of the nucleus and cytoplasm is greatly altered in epen~ dymal cells containing virions. The outlines of the nuclei are often deformed by invaginations of cytoplasm. Two types of changes in ultrastructure of the nuclei were observed. Large masses of chromatin, which in the control animals were located near the nuclear membrane, disappeared and the nuclear chromatin became more homogeneous. Near the inner nuclear membrane a layer of chromatin granules appeared.",

This is one manifestation of segregation of the nucleolus, which may be caused by the action of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA synthesis, and by certain viruses [8, 12, 13] . During segregation, physical separation of DNA and RNA takes place in the nucleolus, with the result that RNA synthesis and protein synthesis becomeimpossible.",
