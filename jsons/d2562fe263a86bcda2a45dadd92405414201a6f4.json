            "text": "Obesity is a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients to develop respiratory failure. Leptin produced in visceral fat might play a role in the deterioration to mechanical ventilation. A cross sectional study was performed. The mean BMI was 31 kg/m 2 (range 24.8 -48.4) for the 31 SARS-CoV-2 ventilated patients and 26 kg/m 2 (range 22.4-33.5) for the 8 controls. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with a similar BMI as control patients appear to have significantly higher levels of serum leptin. The mean leptin level was 21.2 (6.0-85.2) vs 5.6 (2.4-8.2) ug/L for SARS-CoV-2 and controls respectively (p=0.0007). With these findings we designed a clinical and biological framework that explains clinical observations. The ACE2 utilization by the virus leads to local pulmonary inflammation due to ACE2-ATII disbalance. This is enhanced by an increase in leptin production induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection of visceral fat. Leptin receptors in the lungs are now more activated to enhance local pulmonary inflammation. This adds to the pre-existent chronic inflammation in obese patients. Visceral fat, lung tissue and leptin production play an interconnecting role. This insight can lead the way to further research and treatment.",

Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be asymptomatic or experience a flu-like disease 1 , with fever, fatigue, cough, and dyspnea. In addition, gastro-intestinal symptoms are widely described, which suggests a different viral pathogenesis than influenza virus 2 . The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals typically shows a deterioration in health 7 to 9 days after disease onset. In most infected individuals, symptoms of fever and dyspnea resolve around 10 to 12 days post onset, yet some patients go on to develop respiratory failure and become ventilator dependent. The number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation seems to be dependent on the demographic characteristics of infected individuals. In Wuhan-China, 15-27% of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected patients required ventilation 1, 2 , whereas in Seattle-USA a staggering 75% of hospitalized patients required mechanical ventilation 3 .",

Infected cells undergo apoptosis or necrosis triggering a cascade of inflammatory responses driving the secretion of high amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and a disbalance of anti-inflammatory cytokines 7 . This cytokine storm disrupts multiple cellular processes within organs leading to multiple organ failure in patients with SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is expressed by a number of cell types in several organs such as the lungs and intestines, but also abundantly on adipocytes in adipose tissue 8,9 ,. We hypothesize that an excessive fat mass contributes to the hyperinflammatory state, pulmonary inflammation and consecutive respiratory failure. Both influenza virus and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been linked to pulmonary inflammation and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)-like syndromes especially in obese individuals [10] [11] [12] [13] . Visceral fat tissue is known for its proinflammatory effects, which is caused by the Angiotensin II (ATII) system 14 but also by adipokines 10, 15 . The best known proinflammatory adipokine produced by adipose tissue is leptin. A reduction in ACE2 is associated with more ATII and also with higher leptin levels 16 .",

We found a disproportional number of SARS-CoV-2 patients in the ICU with gastric retention requiring duodenal tubing, and leptin is known to decrease gastric motility 18 . The reported anosmia in SARS-CoV-2 disease 19 may also be partly explained by leptin since elevated levels of leptin are thought to alter the olifactory epithelium 20 . SARS-CoV-2 patients relatively frequent present with arterial and venous thrombosis and a hypercoagulable state 1-3 , complications that are also linked to leptin 21 . Many patients experience disproportional weight loss during their disease course 1 . Leptin is also known to induce an anorectic response, increased energy expenditure and metabolic responses 22 . The relatively high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in SARS-CoV-2 critically ill patients 23 might also be related to leptin, since serum CRP levels are known to associated with leptin levels 24 . In addition, SARS-CoV-2 patients in the ICU, despite being overweight, need a relatively low dose of insulin to regulate their blood glucose which could be attributed to the insulin-like effect of leptin 25 . Infected patients in the ICU are hemodynamically stable and show little signs of vasodilation as seen in other infectious states which might be due to the altered ACE2-ATII balance. Last but not least, altered leptin sensitivity in obese patients may, in combination with a viral infection, contribute to an excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine response and to a less effective response to infection 10 .",

An association between obesity and an increased risk of pneumonia has already been identified and is amongst other factors hypothesized to be driven by hyperleptinemia 10, 26 . The onset of respiratory failure usually takes around 8-12 days after the initial signs of infection. This provides a window of opportunity to intervene in the pathophysiological processes driving respiratory failure. If leptin indeed plays a crucial role, medication that reduces leptin production might attenuate pulmonary edema, respiratory failure and the need to be admitted to the intensive care. Several compounds might be able to reduce leptin production, amongst them, Resveratrol seems the most promising 27 .",

Being a framework for further research we propose the following model ( figure 2 ). SARS-CoV2 binds to ACE2 receptors located in the respiratory tract, lungs and visceral fat which results in shedding of the receptor. In particular the individuals with syndrome X have extensive visceral fat, insulin resistance, hypertension (high ATII levels), high leptin levels and can also be leptin resistant. As a result, a chronic lowgrade inflammation is present, which excellerates due to SARS-CoV-2 infection induced disbalance of ACE2-ATII. In addition, since ACE2 suppresses leptin levels through alamandine production and activation of the MrgD-receptor/c/Src/p38MAPK pathway we propose that compromising ACE2 function results in a further increase in leptin levels 30 . This results in a hyperinflammatory local pulmonary response involving local leptin receptors and local ACE2-ATII disbalance. Consequently, this framework can explain respiratory failure as well as the other clinical observations. In addition, other known effects of obesity like tachypnoea, decreased lung and chest wall compliance, and aberrant respiratory muscle adaptations, can lead to respiratory failure so severe that mechanical ventilation is required. The findings of this study may assist in the urgent need to find ways to treat SARS-CoV-2 infected overweight patients to prevent them from being admitted to the ICU as a result of respiratory failure.",
