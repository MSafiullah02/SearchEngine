The patients who were positive for an adenovirus infection were enrolled in this study, and their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Adenoviruses were isolated from 310 patients. The male to female ratio was 1.6:1 and mean age was 32 \u03ee 24 months. Children under 5 years of age had the highest prevalence. In 2007, adenovirus infections occurred endemically throughout the year. The clinical diagnoses were primarily upper respiratory tract infections (45.4%), lower respiratory tract infections (48.1%), and neurologic disease (5.2%). Associated symptoms, signs and laboratory findings included fever (91.9%), cough (83.9%), pharyngeal injection (62.3%), rale (32.6%) and elevated C-reactive protein (93.9%). The most common radiologic findings were perihilar and peribronchial infiltrates (42.6%). Co-infections were observed in 29 cases. The mean durations of hospitalization and fever were 6.2 \u03ee 6.5 and 4.8 \u03ee 3.1 days, respectively. The lengths of hospitalization were similar for patients admitted for upper respiratory tract infections with severe morbidity and those admitted for lower respiratory tract infections.

In our study, 81.3% of the adenoviral infections occurred in young children between 6 months and 5 years of age. Similar demographic features have been reported in other studies. 13, 14 According to Pereira's report, children aged 5 years had higher antibody positivity against adenovirus, and most infections happened in children younger than 5 years. 15 Infants less than 6 months of age are known to have a neutralizing antibody by maternal transmission, which appears to be protective during the first 6 months of life. The frequency of infection was low in infants under 6 months of age; however, a severe case, such as encephalitis, as reported in this study, may occur. The male to female ratio was 1.6:1. The tendency for male predominance has been described in the literature concerning adenovirus infection, as well as in studies of other respiratory viruses. [16] [17] [18] We observed that more cases of adenoviral infectious disease occurred in 2007. Adenovirus was the most common in the spring and summer of 2007, but occurred throughout the year in other years examined in this study. It seems that adenovirus shows a seasonal variation, with sporadic epidemics. In Korea, small outbreaks of adenovirus infection were reported in the summer of 1995 and in the spring of 1996. 19 In a temperate climate, such as Korea, adenovirus infections are known to occur in the spring, early summer and winter. 20 Our data showed similar findings, illustrating a slight tendency toward variations in the seasons in which adenovirus was detected more frequently.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 203, "end": 206, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 207, "end": 209, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 469, "end": 472, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 473, "end": 475, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 643, "end": 645, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1164, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1169, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1174, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1582, "end": 1584, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1705, "end": 1707, "text": "20", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In one study, 21 adenoviral diseases in children were characteristically accompanied by a high and persistent (mean 5.4 days) fever.

Larra\u00f1aga et al. 22 reported that 70% of hospitalized children with adenoviral infection had pneumonia, while our results revealed a significant proportion of patients (45.4%) with URTI. The prolonged fever associated with adenovirus infection highlights the primary cause for hospital treatment in patients with URTI. Also, many patients appeared to have gastrointestinal symptoms with hepatic involvement, as determined by a mild to high elevation of liver enzymes. Adenovirus was detected in the CSF of one infant who was diagnosed with encephalitis. According to our study, the clinical manifestation of adenovirus infection varied, with multiple organ involvement. Several studies have demonstrated that adenovirus is unique among the common respiratory viruses in that it can involve other organs, resulting in conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, acute hemorrhagic cystitis and meningoencephalitis. 23, 24 Although the white blood cell count was within the normal range in most patients (76.4%), elevated CRP and ESR levels were shown in 93.9% of all the patients. Elevated CRP and ESR levels are also generally thought to be related to bacterial infection, as they are inflammatory markers. Others have reported that adenoviral infection typically results in elevated ESR and CRP levels, unlike what is seen in other viral diseases. 25, 26 Therefore, it is not surprising that many patients were initially treated with antibiotics.

We found no significant difference in disease severity between adenovirus-infected patients with co-infection and those without.
