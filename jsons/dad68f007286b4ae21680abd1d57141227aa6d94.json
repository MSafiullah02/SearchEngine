The virus (termed SARS-CoV-2) shares 88% sequence identity to two coronaviruses found in bats, bat-SLCoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, 79% identity with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and 50% identity with Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus [4] . From the first cohort of patients, 8 complete genomes were 99.9% identical in sequence. Given that the typical RNA coronavirus evolves at a rate of 10 4 nucleotide substitutions per year, this suggests a recent single source emergence in early December or late November 2019 [4] .

It may also be possible to enhance the protective host immune response to infection, or inhibit immunopathogenesis (which is thought to contribute to disease severity for some respiratory pathogens). In particular, 'cytokine storms' are thought to be major contributors to the severity of many lower respiratory tract infections, such as influenza [20] and SARS [21] . Host-targeted therapies might therefore be aimed at either enhancement of innate immune clearance of SARS-CoV-2 or inhibition of inflammatory damage to the airway and the development of secondary bacterial pneumonias. In the first 41 cases, 22% were given systemic corticosteroids, with the aim of suppressing inflammation induced lung injury [1] ; however, current WHO guidelines do not recommend their use and data from SARS and MERS showed that corticosteroids did not reduce mortality and potentially delayed viral clearance [22] [23] [24] .
