TB control will focus on TB disease rather than prevention (such as the management of latent, non-transmissible TB infection). This arises in part because of a TB workforce being re-directed to manage COVID-19, others being off sick or self-isolating (up to 30% of healthcare staff); and the concern that too much social contact within a clinic is likely to result in more viral transmission. The need to reduce contact with patients who see their TB service as a source of both social and medical support may result in reduced adherence and worse outcomes. This will affect those who are least able to self-care\u2014in other words the very people who most need TB services.",

In households who are self-isolating, a coughing adult may have a viral infection, though could have TB that is then inadvertently passed on to other family members.",

This very ambitious target requires sustained political and financial commitment from African countries toward the provision of basic essential universal health care, and specifically for TB diagnostic, prevention and treatment services. However, the studies cited earlier suggest that, even prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the quality of TB care in Africa is sub-optimal.

The diagnosis of childhood TB is not only made at dedicated clinics of National TB control programs but equally in generic child health clinics and hospital wards. Many of these facilities will be closed or overwhelmed with other tasks, and as a result diagnostic opportunity in children will be missed. The majority of children in LMIC are not seen by dedicated paediatric specialists, and many general physicians and nurses usually available for their care will be seconded to dealing with adult patients affected by severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 instead.",

Hence it will be assumed that children will cope better and do not need similar attention from the health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are already witnessing this trend in HIC where routine clinics are cancelled and paediatric intensive care beds are handed over to adult services. Laboratories are likely to be overwhelmed with analyses of respiratory specimens sent for COVID-19 rather than M. tuberculosis or other pathogens, and once the eagerly anticipated Xpert cartridges for COVID-19 are rolled out it is easy to imagine that GeneXpert platforms will be seconded for COVID-19 diagnostics.",

However, the timely diagnosis of TB in children is even more essential to prevent deaths.

Apart from TB meningitis, TB rarely presents as an acute, severe illness in children but progresses silently until tipping points are reached. Such subtle presentations are likely to be missed if children cannot be reviewed regularly. Given the overlapping presentations of TB and pneumonia in children in the first place, many children are initially placed on a trial of antibiotics but ought to be reviewed in a timely fashion.
