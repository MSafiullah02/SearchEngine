The current definition of asthma combines clinical\u2013pathological presence of chronic inflammatory airway with hyperresponsiveness and episodic airway obstruction with variable degrees of reversibility with treatment or spontaneously [1]. Asthma is worldwide and is of pandemic levels for the past 30 years, with >300 million people afflicted globally [2]. Although asthma is considered more common in affluent and developed countries, approximately half are in developing countries [3], which account for more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s population. It is estimated that asthma accounts for 25,000 annual deaths, and that by 2025 the number of asthmatics will increase by more than 100 million new cases [2, 4]. In the United States 8.4 % of the population has asthma with substantial annual morbidity of 500,000 hospitalization and 1.9 million emergency visits, at an annual cost of $56 billion [5].",

            "text": "The hallmark of asthma from a pathological perspective is the presence of inflammation with smooth muscle contraction and largely reversible airway obstruction. The inflammation and exaggerated airway responsiveness is associated with mucus hypersecretion, often with increased eosinophils locally and systemically. At the cellular level the changes consist of airway remodeling characterized by smooth muscle hyperplasia, subepithelial cell fibrosis, goblet cell hyperplasia, and neovascularization [18]. The airway inflammation which is a major component of asthma involves influx of mast cells, neutrophils, Th-2 cells, and eosinophils. On exposure to allergen or infectious agent the physiological changes that occur are driven by Th-2 inflammation, with increased Th-2 cytokines [IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13], and decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines, i.e., IL-10 [18]. The heightened Th-2 response causes activation of natural killer cells, dendritic cells and eosinophils, which result in eosinophilia, increased matrix metalloprotease activity, increase in serum IgE levels, and promotion of smooth muscle hypercontraction. IL-13 is central to the progression of asthma and is produced in response to toll-like receptor-4 [TLR-4] signaling, and many micro-RNAs are directly or indirectly involved in the production and upregulation [18].",

Nonatopic asthma is usually late or adult onset with normal serum IgE levels, and more commonly associated with nasal polyps and aspirin sensitivity. However, there is data to suggest that IgE-mediated mechanism in the airway is involved and staphylococcal enterotoxins have been implicated [19]. The nonatopic form of asthma may be the commonest form in children of developing countries and has been related to exposures to environmental dirt, bacterial infection, and psychosocial distress of poverty [20].",

In established asthma respiratory viral infections attract bronchial inflammatory cells, alter airway receptor expression on smooth muscle cells, and modulate neuroimmune mechanisms, leading to bronchospasm and exacerbation of disease [36]. Multiple mechanisms are probably involved including loss of function or downregulation of M2 muscarinic receptors on the airway parasympathetic nerves, which normally inhibit vagal-mediated bronchospasm [37]. Interferons produced in response to viral infections downregulate the expression of the M2 receptor gene, and eosinophils recruited by allergens release major basic proteins, which bind to the M2 receptors and block their function [37]. Thus a multitude of respiratory viruses that can cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections and a few atypical bacteria can cause exacerbation of asthma.",

Development of new onset of asthma has been correlated with a variety of respiratory viruses, most commonly RSV bronchiolitis in infancy and RV infection in older children [39]. Wheezing illness in infancy is most commonly caused by marked RSV bronchiolitis [70 % of episodes], and less frequently with parainfluenza virus, influenza, and metapneumoviruses [39]. Although RSV infection is almost universal in young children only about 40 % develop clinically overt disease and some develop severe bronchiolitis with recurrent infection and wheezing. Risk factors for severe lower respiratory tract infection include younger age, small lungs size, passive smoke exposure, and virus-induced immune responses [39].",

Although RSV bronchiolitis increase the risk of frequent [>3 episodes per year] or infrequent [<3 episodes per year of wheezing], the risk gradually decreased by age 13. The results of this study may be explained by a more recent study assessing recurrent wheezing and development of asthma in a birth cohort followed for 13 years, and the relationship to perennial allergen exposure and sensitization [41]. Chronic asthma developed in atopic children in the first 3 years of life to repeated exposures to allergens, and determined by continuing allergic airway inflammation characterized by airway-hyperresponsiveness and impairment of lung function at a later age school age. Whereas children with nonatopic wheezing phenotype lose their symptoms over school age and retain normal pulmonary function at a later age [41]. Other studies have suggested that RSV bronchiolitis predispose to recurrent wheezing and asthma in the genetically predisposed children [42, 43]. A large epidemiological study from Tennessee [USA] found that children born approximately 120 days before the peak RSV season were at the highest risk for hospital admission with wheezing, and at a higher risk for later development of asthma [44]. However, the association of severe RSV infection in infancy and later development of asthma overlapped with genetic determinants in a study of 8,280 twin-pairs [45]. The investigators of this study concluded that severe RSV infection may not be the cause of asthma, but there was a genetic predisposition to both RSV bronchiolitis and asthma. The best evidence to date in support of a causal association between RSV infection and asthma is the result of the long-term study over 18 years in Swedish children. Children who had RSV bronchiolitis as infants compared to matched controls had a greater prevalence of asthma at 18 years old, 39 % versus 9 % [46]. The affected children also demonstrated increase in perennial allergens sensitization [41 % versus 14 %] and recurrent episodes of wheezing, 30 % versus 1 %. In a previous study children with past bronchiolitis had an enhanced IL-4 response to RSV and cat allergen [Th-2 response], whereas controls had an equally strong interferon-gamma [IFN-\u03b3] response [Th-1 type] to RSV antigens [47].",

There is increasing evidence that RV infections can lead to the development of asthma [50], and bronchial epithelial cells of asthmatics have a deficient innate immune response to RV infection [51]. In a recent prospective longitudinal study of 285 children with high risk for allergic diseases and asthma followed from birth, allergic sensitization leads to increased risk of RV-induced wheezing but not RSV infection up to 6 years [52]. However, viral wheeze did not lead to subsequent allergic sensitization. In an earlier study sensitization to common aeroallergens nearly doubled the risk for asthma at 6 years, and viral respiratory tract infection with wheezing quadrupled the risk for asthma over this time [53]. The combined effect appeared to be synergistic as the risk of asthma was ninefold greater with both wheezing episodes from respiratory infections and allergic sensitization. Recent evidence also suggests that RV infection induces bronchial epithelial production of a number of growth factors and other mediators [chemokines and cytokines] that could contribute to the development and progression of airway remodeling present in asthma [54].",

Experimentally induced viral infections in animals and human volunteers indicate that viruses can enhance airway hyperresponsiveness [56]. Virus-induced airway hyperresponsiveness is multifactorial and involves changes in neural control of the airways, impaired inactivation of tachykinins, and effects on nitric oxide production [57]. There is further evidence that atopic or allergic subjects with increased IgE and eosinophilic airway inflammation have greater risk of virus-induced wheezing than nonallergic individuals [58]. Although several studies suggest that there is an interaction between response to viral infection and aeroallergens in asthma the mechanisms are unclear. Viral infections could damage the epithelial airway barrier to enhance absorption of aeroallergens and thus enhance airway inflammation [59]. Generation of various cytokines and chemokines by viral infection may upregulate cellular recruitment to enhance allergen-induced inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Experimental RV infection can enhance lower airway histamine responses and eosinophils recruitment to allergen challenge [60]. The possibility that allergic inflammation might intensify the host response to viral respiratory infections or impair viral clearance has been suggested by some studies but not confirmed by others [39].",

            "text": "A central role in the pathogenesis of asthma is the allergen-specific IgE, the production of which is mediated by the Th-2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13 [38]. IgE receptors on mast cells and basophils bind to allergens, resulting in release of mediators such as histamine which produce airway inflammation and hyperreactivity. It has been proposed that the immune dysfunction in infancy could predispose to recurrent viral lower respiratory tract infection and be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. In a community-based cohort of children, with a family history of atopy, relative deficiency of circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells in infancy was correlated with increased frequency and severity of viral respiratory infections, wheezing, and diagnoses of asthma [65]. The usual response to viral respiratory infections by a mature immune system is to stimulate proliferation of cytolytic T cells and the Th1-CD4 helper T cells. This results in release of IFN-\u03b3, upregulation of IL-12, and stimulation of macrophages [66], typical for the Th1 response. However, there is experimental evidence that severe RSV infection in neonates could determine the pattern of T-cell-mediated disease during later life. Primary RSV infection in neonatal mice was associated with reduced and delayed IFN-\u03b3 responses, and subsequent reinfection resulted in increased inflammatory cell recruitment, with a shift to increased Th2-cytokine and increased eosinophils, typical for allergy and asthma [67]. A similar animal model also confirmed that viral respiratory infection in early life results in overproduction of the Th2-cytokines, IL-13, with increased risk for respiratory allergies, and changes in the airway structure conducive for asthma [68]. In clinical studies of acute exacerbation of asthma induced by viral infection, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrate increased expression of IFN-responsive genes and increased expression of Th2-chemokines, indicating enhanced allergic inflammation linked to the innate antiviral response [69, 70].",

The combined infectious burden of H. pylori, Toxoplasmosis gondii, hepatitis A, herpes simplex 1, C. pneumoniae, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and Cytomegalovirus [determined by presence of antibodies] was associated with lower risk of atopy, asthma, and allergic rhinitis in 1,249 adults in Europe [88]. However, in other cross-sectional studies in adults there was no association of H. pylori serological status and asthma or atopy [89]. Although in an experimental mouse model of allergic asthma, H. pylori infection could prevent asthma development through the induction of regulatory T cells [90].",

This topic was reviewed in 2011, with the conclusion that it is biologically plausible that oral bacteria through immune mechanisms could influence the risk of allergic diseases, but the data was insufficient to draw any conclusions [92]. In a childhood birth cohort prospective study from Copenhagen, aspirates of the hypopharynx were obtained from asymptomatic 1-month-old infants of asthmatic mothers for bacterial culture and subsequently correlated with later development of asthma at 5 years of age [29]. Colonization of the hypopharynx with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis or with a combination of these organisms was at increased risk for recurrent wheeze and asthma in early life. A subsequent study has shown that polymorphism of the IL-17 gene was associated with childhood asthma and bacterial colonization of the hypopharynx in bronchiolitis [93]. Thus bacterial colonization of the hypopharynx in neonates and childhood asthma may be linked to a genetic predisposition. However, there is no evidence that antibiotics use in early life decreases or increases the risk for later development of asthma [94]. It has been postulated that bacterial colonization of the airway could be related to development of IgE against bacterial antigen, implicating a role for bacterial-specific type-2 immunity in the pathogenesis of asthma. Titers of IgE against H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were measured in 1,380 teenagers and correlated with asthma and immunophenotypes [95]. IgE titers against S. aureus-derived enterotoxins were highest among atopic subjects and were associated with increased risk of asthma. However, high IgE titers against H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were associated with a decreased risk of asthma. The investigators postulated that lower availability of soluble forms of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae antigens reduces the cross-link with IgE receptors systemically, but the availability of these antigens at the mucosal level to antigen presenting cells and type-2 memory cells could lead to mucosal secretion of IL-4/IL-13 producing an atopic response [95].",

Atopic children had more clostridia and fewer bifidobacteria, reduced ratio of bifidobacteria to clostridia than nonatopic infants, p = 0.03. Moreover, experimental studies in mice have shown that alterations of the gut microbiota can play an important role in regulating immune responses in the lungs to inhaled antigens [102].

It remains unclear from the results of this cross-sectional study whether the asthmatic airway predisposed to specific bacteria or vice versa. A subsequent study in 65 adults with suboptimally controlled asthma and 10 healthy controls assessed the bacterial burden of bronchial epithelium by 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon concentration [104]. Bacterial diversity and concentrations were significantly higher among asthmatic patients than controls. The relative abundance of particular phenotypes including members of Comamonadaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, and other bacterial families were highly correlated with the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness [104]. These two studies suggest that the microbiome of the airways may contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma.

Recruitment of eosinophils in the airway is the main trigger for inflammation and bronchoconstriction on exposure to aeroallergens, and may play a role in the antiviral immunity to eradicate viruses and to decrease invasion of epithelial cells [106]. Neutrophils, which are considered more important in bacterial infection as part of the innate immune response, appear to be important in the pathogenesis of nonatopic intrinsic asthma.

However, it is unclear whether or not these genetic predispositions are present in only a fraction of children who develop asthma after severe recurrent lower respiratory infections. There is experimental evidence that viral respiratory infection in atopic children may initiate an atopy-dependent cascade that amplifies and sustains airway inflammation initiated by antiviral immunity by utilizing underlying atopic-associated mechanisms [70]. Recent evidence that anti-IgE monthly prophylactic therapy can significantly reduce asthma exacerbations in children, particularly during the common cold season [109], supports a mechanistic interaction of the viral Th1-type response and the allergic Th2-type response which result in increased IgE. This has been attributed to a defective type-1 response to rhinoviruses in atopic asthma, with reduced IFN-\u03b3 and shift toward a type-2 phenotype [108].",

The data indicate that commensal microbiota responsible for conferring an immunogenic environment in the lungs is either gram-positive bacteria of the gut and possible commensal of the nasal mucosa.

It has recently been postulated that changes in diet, which is different in developed countries from developing nations, and associated changes in the gut microbiota are driving the increasing incidence of autoimmune and allergic diseases in developed countries [114]. Diet itself has considerable effect on the composition of the gut microbiota, and experiments in mice show changes in their microbial composition, metabolic pathways, and gene expression just after 1 day on the Western diet [115]. The Western diet causes an increase in bacteria of the Firmicutes phylum and a decrease in those of the Bacteroidetes phylum. The gut microbiota of children in Africa is greatly different from those in Europe, and this is attributed primarily to dietary differences [115]. The examples provided by the authors to support the hypothesis of diet rather than hygiene affecting the incidence of asthma are the relatively low prevalence of asthma in Japan compared to Australia and the United States [115]. Japan has high a degree of sanitation and urbanization but much different diet that would influence the gut microbiota/microbiome. In addition, the urban poor in the USA with greater frequency of infection, crowding, and likely less sanitary habits still have a high incidence of asthma.",

            "text": "Vitamin D deficiency could be the common factor linking asthma, allergy, and respiratory infections [116]. Vitamin D is important for effective function of the innate and adaptive immunity. Vitamin D is associated with a dose-dependent reduction in the transcription of Th1-cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 and increase in the Th2-cytokines, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells culture [116]. Thus vitamin D has a key role in the Th1-Th2 balance. Deficiency of vitamin D is common in children and adults of temperate regions of the world, and is associated with higher risk of upper and lower respiratory infections, especially in children. Only 10 % of vitamin D is acquired from ingested food and 90 % from synthesis after sunlight exposure. Therefore, the higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency seen in countries of the Northern hemisphere could explain the greater incidence of asthma in prosperous countries compared to poorer nations, which are predominantly located in tropical and subtropical regions of the globe. The link between vitamin D deficiency and respiratory infections is particularly relevant in children who develop asthma after recurrent respiratory tract infection in early childhood. This seasonality of influenza and RSV-induced bronchiolitis has been linked to the greater prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the winter [117, 118]. In a recent prospective birth cohort study of 156 healthy neonates, low concentration of vitamin D from cord blood was associated with increased risk of RSV bronchiolitis in the first year of life [119].",

These results were confirmed in another study by the same group of investigators in a cohort of 1,024 children, and it was suggested that vitamin D may protect against respiratory infections and symptoms of asthma by reducing bronchial inflammation [125]. This postulate was confirmed by a small double-blind randomized study that showed vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of asthma exacerbation by respiratory tract infections from fall to spring [126].",

In mice feeding of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota was effective in inhibiting IgE production to a commonly used allergen [130]. The value of probiotics in allergic diseases has been assessed in several randomized, controlled trials, but mainly involving subjects with atopic eczema, allergic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis. The main limitations of these trials have included small sample sizes, heterogeneity, and lack of a standardized acceptable probiotic mixture. This topic was last reviewed by Yao et al. who came to the conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for allergic diseases, including asthma [131]. The authors noted that the preventative studies failed to show a significant reduction in atopic sensitization, and there have been reports of probiotics administered during the perinatal period being associated with greater risk of later development of wheezing or asthma [131].",
