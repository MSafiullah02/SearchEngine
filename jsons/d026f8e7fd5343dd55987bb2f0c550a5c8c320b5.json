[4, 5, 6, 7] Reaching vulnerable populations and those of lower socioeconomic status (SES) during a pandemic is of particular importance as individuals of lower SES have greater barriers to information access and are more likely to adopt incorrect protective behaviors. [8] To further promote telehealth in the COVID-19 era, throughout March and April of 2020 federal and state policies have been altered to remove or ease geographic restrictions and other regulatory barriers to telehealth visits. [10] Telehealth is well-suited for use during pandemics as clinicians can provide care and consultation to isolated populations and counter the surge in demand for medical care while using telehealth as a form of electronic personal protective equipment. [9, 11, 12, 13] Telehealth in the COVID-19 era is, thus, theorized as a useful strategy in \"forward triage,\" the sorting of patients prior to their arrival in the emergency department [13, 14] and as a means to provide patient guidance and reassurance [11] .",

[15] On March 13 th , our health care system launched a RN triage-linked, 24-hour availability, physician-staffed hotline to assess, advise and treat individuals who called with symptoms that could be COVID-19 related. Over the next five weeks, the RN triage line received more than 12,000 calls resulting in more than 5,000 physician telehealth visits. While other institutions have reported on the establishment of triage system protocols within their electronic health records (EHRs) and have updated patient portals to provide patients with self-triage and self-scheduling abilities [15] [16] [17] , to our knowledge this is the first study to examine use of a COVID-19 hotline that provides patients with direct physician care.",

Services that depend on internet access, such as patient portals, have been shown have lower usage among older adults, racial and ethnic minorities and older people, the very populations most affected by COVID-19 severe disease in the United States. Further, results of our multivariable models indicate that primary care physicians assessing patients over the phone make effective decisions about which patients will require use of emergency services and which can be safely managed at home.",

[28] Our findings provide evidence for the effectiveness of such an approach, and suggest that policymakers and medical and public health leaders should consider widespread implementation of physician-staffed telehealth services as a key component of effective, equitable pandemic response.",
