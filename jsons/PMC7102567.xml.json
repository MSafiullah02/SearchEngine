            "text": "Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections exhibit symptoms of viral pneumonia including fever, cough or dyspnea, and bilateral lung infiltration in severe cases. All these three CoVs induce excessive and aberrant non-effective host immune responses that are associated with severe lung pathology, leading to death.32 The autopsy results of dead patients indicate diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with alveolar edema, focal hemorrhage and hyaline membrane formation,33 which are similar to the pathological manifestations of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).34 However, most SARS-CoV-2 were mild or moderate cases, meanwhile cases report showed that the clinical manifestations and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in renal transplant recipients were generally consistent with common SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.15 According to our investigation of epidemiologic history, we could not deny the possibility of contacting and getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 in HTx recipients. It is important to note that laboratory data may be misleading in HTx since several of our patients already exhibited lymphopenia which may be a result of use of immunosuppressants which prevent lymphocyte development and proinflammatory cytokines genes expression, such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-3, IL-4, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1.36, 37, 38, 39 Glucocorticoids inhibit immune responses by negative regulating immunocytes,40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 and especially weaken the strength of the T-cell receptor (TCR) signal, which is important in T cells activation and differentiation46. Thus, we imply that if HTx recipients were infected with SARS-CoV-2, they may not exhibit typical manifestations in the early stage due to the presence of immunosuppression. Our data suggest that maintaining the blood trough concentration of FK506 at (7.9\u00b12.9) ng/mL is appropriate. Yet the appropriate degree of immunosuppression needs further verification.",
