The responsible pathogen is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical spectrum associated with COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia, leading to intensive care unit (ICU) admission [2\u20134]. Evidence of cerebrovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 is limited, but previous reports from the SARS epidemic in Asia in 2003 suggested a higher incidence of thromboembolic complications, including stroke [5]. Management of acute stroke in the setting of this pandemic disease poses unique challenges, including the need to maintain high-quality stroke care with limited resources, while at the same time preventing infection spread to patients and physicians [6]. A better characterization of cerebrovascular complications associated with COVID-19 infection is important to guide decision making.",

We included only patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the Fondazione Poliambulanza Hospital, Brescia, Italy, or the Udine University Hospital, Udine, Italy, between March 16 and April 5, 2020. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined by a positive result on a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay on nasopharyngeal swabs. Demographic data, information on clinical presentation and evolution, and laboratory and radiologic results were recorded. The severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was rated using the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (partial pressure of arterial oxygen over the fraction of inspired oxygen) which was indicated whenever available. Acute lung injury is present if PaO2/FiO2 ratio is \u2264 300 [7]. Each diagnosis of stroke was confirmed by brain computed tomography (CT)/CT angiography (CTA), and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All examinations were reviewed by two experienced neuroradiologists (DB, MM). Neurological presentations were reviewed by one experienced neurologist (AV). Descriptive analysis is presented as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and as the median and range for continuous variables. All procedures were performed in accordance with the institutional ethics committee and the Declaration of Helsinki.",

Due to an acute myocardial infarction, he underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention 13 years earlier. His treatment included dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) and ramipril. Body temperature at admission was 38.6 \u00b0C. Clinical and laboratory findings indicated moderate respiratory distress (PaO2/FiO2 238). Chest X-ray demonstrated bilateral areas of consolidation. The respiratory function progressively worsened and 3 days later he was intubated and mechanically ventilated. In the following days, the patient developed kidney failure (creatinine 3.22 mg/dL, n.v. 0.72\u20131.18), increased indices of inflammation and hepatic injury (C-reactive protein [CRP] 175 mg/L, n.v. < 5; lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] 1032 IU/L, n.v. 125\u2013220; aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 152 IU/L, n.v. 4\u201340; gamma-glutamyltransferase [GGT] 1165 IU/L, n.v. 8\u201361; total bilirubin 6.64 mg/dL, n.v. 0.2\u20131) and neurological deterioration, with inability to arouse during sedation lightening. All these features together were suggestive of multiorgan failure. Coagulation tests showed thrombocytopenia (78 \u00d7 103/\u00b5L, n.v. 150\u2013400) associated with increased international normalized ratio (INR 1.62, n.v. 0.80\u20131.20) and increased D-dimer (7744 ng/mL, n.v. 0\u2013500). On day 16, a total body CT demonstrated extensive bilateral consolidations and ground-glass opacities of the lungs with bilateral pleural effusion (Fig. 1a) and a filling defect in the right pulmonary artery due to pulmonary embolism. A cuneiform hypodense area was also detected in the spleen (Fig. 1b). Brain CT showed multiple hypodense lesions involving different cortical and subcortical regions of both cerebral hemispheres (Fig. 1c and d). Clinical, laboratory and imaging findings were consistent with pulmonary thrombo-embolism associated with multiple ischemic lesions involving the brain and spleen. Three days after CT examination, the patient died.",

The patient had a previous history of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, aortic valve replacement, and cerebellar stroke. Her treatment included aspirin and warfarin. Body temperature at admission was 37.6 \u00b0C. Clinical and laboratory evaluation indicated mild respiratory distress (PaO2/FiO2 261). Chest CT demonstrated multiple areas of ground-glass opacities and consolidations mainly involving the lower lobes (Fig. 2e). The family members reported a number of episodes of transient loss of consciousness, followed by confusion, in the days preceding admission to the hospital. Blood tests showed increased CRP (12 mg/L, n.v. < 5) and D-dimer (1381 ng/mL, n.v. 0\u2013500). On day 4, EEG showed a normal background in the alpha range (8 Hz), associated with recurrent sharp slow waves over the left temporal region, which occasionally were seen also on the right homologous regions. The episodes were interpreted as focal seizures and treatment with levetiracetam was introduced. A brain CT demonstrated a small hypodense area (5 mm) in the head of the right caudate nucleus referable to a lacunar infarction. On day 5, a contrast-enhanced brain MRI showed a small rounded area of diffusion restriction on the left pre-rolandic gyrus (Fig. 2f, fluid attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR] imaging; g, diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]). The lesion previously noted in the right caudate nucleus was hyperintense on T2-FLAIR, with no diffusion restriction but faint contrast enhancement (Fig. 2h). A small cortical-leptomeningeal area of enhancement was also noted in the left middle frontal gyrus at the level of the superior frontal sulcus. T2* GRE revealed no hypointense lesions consistent with hemorrhagic lesions. Brain MRI angiography showed no alterations of intracranial vessels. In the following days, the patient remained confused and demonstrated severe behavioral abnormalities, including delirium and aggressiveness. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis demonstrated normal protein content (0.5 g/L), 0 leukocyte, and normal IgG index. A comprehensive autoimmune screening was unrevealing. On day 10, a new EEG excluded non-convulsive status epilepticus, while showing persistence of sharp slow waves, mainly over the left hemispheric regions. At the last follow-up, 14 days after admission, patient\u2019s neurological conditions were only partially improved (mRS = 4).",

Chest CT demonstrated diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities with no pleural effusion (Fig. 3e). On day 5, his respiratory function worsened and he was transferred to ICU for invasive ventilation. He was treated with 4000 IU enoxaparin daily subcutaneously. Despite regular cardiac activity and well-supported respiratory function, 7 days after admission in ICU his neurological conditions suddenly deteriorated. The patient was found with bilaterally fixed and dilated pupils, with a GCS of 3. A brain CT (Fig. 3f\u2013h) demonstrated diffuse cerebral edema with a large right frontal hemorrhage (6.0 \u00d7 5.2 cm on the axial plane) extending to the ventricular system. The ventricles were displaced across the midline. Four additional smaller intra-axial hemorrhages occurred in both hemispheres. Coagulation tests were normal.

Most of the patients were elderly male with comorbidities. Ischemic lesions were typically multiple and bilateral, suggesting an embolic etiology. Conversely, the detection of simultaneous multiple intracerebral hemorrhages associated with severe brain edema is unprecedented in this setting and raises important issues in the management of patients with Covid-19. Taken together, these factors could account for the poor outcome observed in this cohort. Given the fact that vascular risk factors were frequent, the association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke might be coincidental. Nevertheless, a body of epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidence suggests that patients with COVID-19 are at higher risk of thromboembolic complications, including neurovascular diseases, in the acute phase of infection. In particular, previous experiences from other coronavirus-related diseases, the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), have highlighted stroke, pulmonary embolism and myocardial infarction as possible complications, especially in critically ill patients [5, 8]. Additionally, a recent report from Wuhan, China, showed that acute cerebrovascular disease is not uncommon in COVID-19, and it represents a negative prognostic factor. Among 221 infected patients, 11 (5%) developed ischemic stroke, 1 (0.5%) cerebral venous thrombosis, and 1 (0.5%) brain hemorrhage [9]. In agreement with the finding of the present study, it was also observed that cardiovascular risk factors were common, while the patients demonstrated increased biomarkers of inflammatory response as well as a hypercoagulable state [9].",

            "text": "The relationship between acute infection and stroke is complex and it was demonstrated for many types of bacterial and viral infections. Importantly, an increased risk of stroke was documented after respiratory infections, including influenza, and the risk was highest within the first week [10]. Accordingly, measures to prevent viral illnesses (e.g., influenza vaccination) were shown to be protective for the development of cerebrovascular disease [11]. Intriguingly, the association between infection and stroke is also relevant for patients with preexistent risk factors. In this group, the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques to rupture appears to be increased in the presence of systemic inflammation and sepsis [10]. The mechanisms by which viral infections can trigger stroke are multiple and depend on the associated pathogen and host characteristics. For example, varicella zoster virus (VZV) is responsible for a distinctive vasculopathy involving both large and small arteries, which can result in ischemic infarction of the brain and spinal cord, as well as subarachnoid and cerebral hemorrhage [12]. At autopsy, the cerebral arteries showed disruption of the internal elastic lamina and multinucleated giant cells, while the presence of VZV DNA was demonstrated in the posterior cerebral and basilar arteries [13]. Similarly, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a known cause of large vessel vasculopathy (mainly aneurysmal) that can also involve the brain [14]. A vasculitic-like mechanism can also apply in the context of COVID-19, since localized fibrinoid necrosis as well as infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells into vessel walls were demonstrated in three cases of the 2003 SARS disease [15]. Interestingly enough, another type of coronavirus (New Haven CoV) was associated with the development of systemic vasculitis of childhood (Kawasaki disease) in a case\u2013control study [16]. An alternative mechanism leading to stroke during the course of an infection is the presence of a pro-thrombotic state. Numerous reports have documented various coagulation abnormalities (in particular, raised D-dimer, thrombocytopenia, and isolated prolonged aPTT) in patients with SARS-CoV, nearly two decades ago [17, 18]. Chong et al. studied an autopsy series of eight SARS patients and demonstrated the presence of pulmonary embolism in half of them, while one patient developed non-bacterial valvular vegetations associated with infarctions of the heart, kidneys, spleen, and occipital lobe [18]. Similarly, an underlying thrombophilic state can also be hypothesized in SARS-CoV-2 infection, as suggested by a report of pulmonary embolism in patients from Wuhan [19] and in Patient 1 of the present series who also presented brain and spleen lesions suggestive for embolization.",
