As a result of consistent and effective prevention and treatment measures, all of the cases have thus far been mild. However, as of February 12, 2020, the number of patients with COVID-19 has far exceeded the observed rates of SARS and MERS.1 This may be attributable to a failure to identify the etiologic agent early on and the ability of 2019-nCoV to rapidly spread from person to person, rather than greater infectivity of the virus itself.10,11 In contrast to previous reports, most patients (24/26) had not been in close contact with individuals from Wuhan.12 Additionally, 11 patients or their family members worked at the same supermarket, suggesting active viral transmission in a location frequented by a large number of people. Close monitoring is essential for preventing the large-scale spread of the virus in such places.13",
