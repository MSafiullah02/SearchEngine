Resistance to M2 inhibitors has been clinically negligible so far, but which is likely to be detected during widespread use during a pandemic. Meanwhile, the neuraminidase inhibitors may improve the outcomes of HPAI infected patients if administered early, but the clinical evidence is not enough for proving the certain protective efficacy of treating severe HPAI infected patients.",
