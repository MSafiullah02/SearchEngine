COVID-19 is part of a large family of viruses (Coronaviruses) that may cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases (Yang et al., 2020) . Figure 1 summarizes the major events relating to the COVID-19 outbreak. According to Sohrabi et al. (2020) , on 31 December 2019, there were several cases of pneumonia presenting with flu like symptoms in Wuhan. It is believed that the first cases are linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in China (Sohrabi et al. 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . The first death from the virus was reported on 11 January 2020 (Pharmaceutical Technology, 2020) . In the same month, the Chinese authorities rolled out containment measures with extreme quarantine, including closing off large cities, borders, and restraining people to their homes to limit the spread of COVID-19 (Yang et al., 2020) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 328, "end": 347, "text": "(Yang et al., 2020)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 435, "end": 456, "text": "Sohrabi et al.

Major events may significantly affect stock market returns (Zach, 2003) . The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the investment and business environment in China. The principal novelty of the present study is the examination of the effect of contagious infectious diseases, specifically the COVID-19 virus, on stock market returns. As stated, the outbreak started on 31 December 2019, and since then, the number of infected cases has been published on a daily basis.

We also find that B-shares which are designed for foreign investors face a significant higher negative effect on the returns in comparison with A-shares which are traded only by Chinese citizens. Finally, high market capitalization stocks face a significant higher negative effect on the returns in comparison with low market capitalization stocks. The implications of our study are important for stock market main players to understand and predict the behaviour of stock market returns during epidemic diseases.
