However, in blanket testing of an isolated village of approximately 3000 people in northern Italy, 50%\u201375% of people with positive pharyngeal molecular tests were totally asymptomatic [1]. This finding was echoed by a more recent daily surveillance report from China, where all people arriving from overseas were rigorously tested [2]: among 166 persons with newly identified infections, 78% were asymptomatic. Although the infective dose associated with transmission is not known, the viral load in the respiratory tract in an asymptomatic patient has been reported to be similar to patients with symptoms [3], and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from an asymptomatic contact has also been described [4].",

Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was considered possible only when care procedures generating aerosols (e.g. intubation, bronchoscopy, and positive-pressure ventilation) are performed [6]. However, other studies seem to indicate the opposite, i.e., the virus can be present in exhaled air produced by talking and breathing [6]. Moreover, a potential role of aerosols in virus diffusion was evident in a complex laboratory study. Aerosols containing a viral load quite similar to that observed in human respiratory samples were created to generate an aerosolized environment. SARS-CoV-2 was detected up to 3 h after the start of the study [7]. Although these findings were not considered fully convincing by some authors [5], they deserve attention and require further studies to establish whether and when airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 truly occurs and how it can be reduced.",

As SARS-CoV-2 is also embedded in aerosols <5 \u03bcm in diameter, it cannot be determined whether they are always effective. However, mask wearing by patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (an airborne infectious disease) has been shown to reduce infectivity to guinea pigs by 56% [9, 10]. The surgical mask has also been shown to intercept other human coronaviruses during coughing [11]. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials also showed that surgical masks and N95 respirators were similarly effective in preventing influenza-like illness and laboratory-confirmed influenza among healthcare workers [12]. Similar results were obtained in a case-control study comparing the protective effect of surgical masks and N95 respirators against SARS among healthcare workers in five Hong Kong hospitals [13].",

For example, symptomatic patients with cough or sneezing are generally advised to put on a face mask, and this applies equally to patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (airborne transmission) and influenza (predominantly droplet-transmitted). With the large number of asymptomatic patients unware of their own infection [1, 2], the comparable viral load in their upper respiratory tract [3], droplet and aerosol dispersion even during talking and breathing [6], and prolonged viral viability outside our body [7], we strongly advocate universal use of face mask as a means of source control in public places during the COVID-19 pandemic. Extreme forms of social distancing is not sustainable, and complete lockdown of cities or even whole countries is extremely devastating to the economy. Universal masking in public complements social distancing and hand hygiene in containing or slowing down the otherwise exponential growth of the pandemic. Universal masking protects against cross-transmission through unavoidable person-to-person contact during the lockdown and reduces the risk for resurgence during relaxation of social distancing measures on reopening.",

In line with the recent recommedation by US CDC for healthy people to wear a cloth face cover in public [14], we strongly support the use of cloth masks as a simple, economic and sustainable alternative to surgical mask as a means of source control for general community use, so that disposable surgical masks and N95 respirators can be reserved for use in health care facilities.
