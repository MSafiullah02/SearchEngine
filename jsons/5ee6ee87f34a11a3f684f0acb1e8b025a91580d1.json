These discoveries were based on novel virus discovery systems using molecular approaches developed in order to reduce the considerable number of cases in which a clinical diagnosis of a respiratory infection could not be confirmed by the laboratory detection of a pathogen. Following the initial description of the virus, a huge number of clinical studies and case reports have been published which were supplemented by some basic research reports. In parallel, several related viruses have been newly identified, such as a swine bocavirus, a feline bocavirus and a novel canine parvovirus, of which of them share some biological features with HBoV [3, 4] . In 2016, an additional novel bocavirus variant occurring in chimpanzees was identified, which along with the gorilla virus gives rise to the assumption that a long co-evolution between primates and bocaviruses exists [5] [6] [7] .",

This latter fact hampered the development of potent and specific antivirals; tenacity studies and the development of disinfectants active against human parvoviruses as surrogate pathogens with animal pathogenicity were used.

            "text": "The discovery of HBoV has resulted in several molecular findings that are of major interest regarding the pathophysiology of human parvovirus. Within a primary cell culture in which the human bocavirus was replicating, it was possible to identify the HBoV transcriptome including splicing variant of viral RNA [21] . This cell culture demonstrated for the first time a potential tool for the investigation of human parvovirus in its natural infectious setting, enabling investigations of the molecular biology of human parvoviruses in general and HBoV in particular. Unfortunately, the primary cell culture that enables HBoV growth in vitro is very expensive and requires a highly specialized laboratory. Moreover, this is an errorprone cell culture, which means the availability of this technology is limited to several laboratories worldwide, which in turn will delay further research. In search for a broadly convertible replication system, the group headed by Dr. Jianming Qiu from the University of Kansas Medical Center made a significant step forward: this group has established a plasmid-based replicon-like system that has identified additional RNA species that are transcribed during the HBoV replication cycle [22] . The system is based on plasmids that contain the complete published HBoV sequence but are flanked by ITR regions of the adeno-associated virus (AAV); the ITR regions are terminal repeats containing palindromic sequences that form hairpin-like structures which in turn are required for the replication of parvoviruses according to the so-called rolling hairpin mechanisms of replication [23] . With this first replicon system, Chen et al. have shown that HBoV types 1 and 2 express a similar RNA pattern like other parvoviruses. In particular, they identified a spliced NS-1 transcript that was not recognized before and have shown that the NP-1 transcripts are expressed abundantly [22] . In this context it is worth to note that the viral NP1 protein, which is a small NS protein encoded by the middle open reading frame, is required for the expression of viral capsid proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3), whereas the other NS proteins (NS1, NS2, NS3 and NS4) are not essential for the expression of VP proteins [24] .",

In theory, the rolling hairpin replication results in progeny genomes that occur in equal amounts of both polarities, whilst packaging of viral genomes is dependent on additional factors [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . For almost four decades, it is postulated that all parvoviruses replicate according to this mechanism, although this replication model is solely based on experimental data obtained by the research on rodent parvoviruses. The model is characterized by a terminal hairpin-dependent self-priming initiation of the viral genome replication and concatemeric replication intermediates of head-to-head or tail-to-tail replication intermediates. Based on an early publication of the postulated model in 1976 in Nature, this replication model became a dogma in the field of parvovirology and was deemed to be true for all parvoviruses. Interestingly it was impossible to identify both genome polarities in clinical samples containing HBoVinfected cells [32] . Thereby, NASBA analyses revealed that all HBoV strains package negative-strand genome, whilst only a minority also packages the plus strand; this observation is compatible with another replication mechanism known as rolling circle replication. In order to test the hypothesis if rolling circle replication may occur in HBoV infection and in order to decipher the unknown terminal hairpins, a couple of systematic PCR-based analyses were performed [33] .",

Most recently it was shown that these sequences most likely represent the missing terminal hairpin-like structures [33, 34] . Despite identifying the terminal sequences in both clinical samples and cell cultures, a lack of self-priming activity of HBoV genomes as well as the lack of intermediates typical for rolling hairpin replication has been noted. Instead the samples contained head-to-tail structures. Additional groups have published similar observations, all questioning the dogma of parvovirus replication [35] [36] [37] [38] . It is thereby important to know that the head-totail episomal form of HBoV differs from formerly described circular parvoviral episomes that have been shown to consist circular-closed genome dimers of headto-head and tail-to-tail orientation [39] .",

            "text": "Based on the newly identified sequences, the structure of the putative terminal repeats of the HBoV genome was predicted in silico [34] . In addition, the Kansas group has developed a true full-length vector clone of HBoV which can be transfected to HEK-293 cells and produced a \"recombinant wild-type\" human bocavirus that in turn is infectious for differentiated CuFi-8 cells [40] . CuFi-8 cells are derived from a patient with cystic fibrosis and can be grown as monolayer cultures that can be differentiated into a polarized respiratory epithelial structure by changing the culturing media. This polarized respiratory epithelial structure in turn supports HBoV replication [40] . It is worth noting that CuFi-8 cells experience a serious cytopathic effect that is able to destroy the cellular glycocalyx structures ( Fig. 1) and is accompanied by a loss of cilia [41] . This novel cell culture moreover supports the hypothesis that HBoV is a serious pathogen as it induced a remarkable cytopathic effect in the polarized CuFi-8 cell line which in turn is compatible with the assumption that the clinical symptoms of an HBoV infection are caused by tissue damages related to viral replication. Thereby, this infection model harbours a surprising feature that is a further hint for an alternative replication of the human bocavirus: if the full-length HBoV plasmid containing the hairpin sequences is transfected into HEK293 cells, infectious progeny virions are produced although based on the rolling hairpin model this process should be impossible, as the free (!) hairpin sequences are believed to be essential for the replication. In contrast, replication is possible in the plasmid although they are flanked by the vector's backbone sequence and no helper plasmids are required as known for the dependoviruses. This simple observation strongly contradicts the model of rolling hairpin replication but in turn favours other replication models known for circular DNA, as, for exam- Fig. 1 Loss of cilia from glycocalyx of HBoV-infected cells in comparison to mock-infected cells ple, the rolling circle replication, which in the natural infection would produce head-to-tail concatemers. However, it has to be mentioned that despite these conflicting data, the minimal essential origin of replication was identified in the rightend hairpin sequence [42] . Thereby, unlike other parvoviruses, the HBoV-NS1 protein did not specifically bind to the oriR in vitro, indicating that other viral and/ or cellular components or oligomerization of NS1 is required for NS1 binding to the oriR. Of note, NP-1 and other viral nonstructural proteins (NS1-4) co-localized with the viral replication centres [42] . During the viral replication cycle, it appears that the expression of viral capsid proteins is regulated by polyadenylation mechanisms of the viral RNA transcripts [43] . It was shown that in addition to a distal polyadenylation signal named (pA)d, a further distal polyadenylation site named (pA)d2 is present in the right-end hairpin sequence, which does not contain the typical hexanucleotide polyadenylation motif. Moreover, the viral replication is strongly dependent on a newly identified small non-coding RNA named BocaSR within the 3\u2032 non-coding region (nt 5199-5338) [44] . This RNA is transcribed by the RNA polymerase III from an intragenic promotor at amounts similar to the RNAs of the nonstructural genes. BocaSR accumulates in the replication centres within the nucleus and is suspected to directly influence the viral DNA replication.",

These viruses (e.g. the adeno-associated virus, AAV) in turn are able to act as helper viruses for the parvoviral subclass dependoviruses that require those helper viruses for their replication [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . Recently, a clinical case was observed in which the HBoV infection appeared to depend on a co-infection and co-replication of human herpesvirus type 6. In this case the HBoV infection persisted because of an immune disease but was terminated by antiviral therapy with cidofovir which is directed against HHV6 [53] . This was the key observation leading to the assumption that HBoV is either sensitive to cidofovir or that a possible rolling circle HBoV replication is triggered by HHV6, which in turn would explain the high frequency of co-infections observed in case of HBoV [52, 54, 55] .",

It may be speculated as to whether the persistence of HBoV episomes in the lung of the patients is analogous to a HBV infection, in which episomal cccDNA persists in the infected cell until the cell is targeted by the immune response or subjected to apoptosis and in which this chronic state frequently produces a mild inflammation that is subclinical but could induce fibrosis over time. The persistence of HBoV episomes in the lung could have led to mild chronic inflammation eventually resulting in fibrosis of the lung, which would not be easily compensated as in the liver. In the context of a putative chronic HBoV infection or a persistence of HBoV at a subclinical level, it thus appears possible that HBoV could directly or indirectly, by interactions with the immune system, contribute to chronic lung disease such as idiopathic lung fibrosis.",

As early as in 2010, it was shown in A549 cells that the expression of HBoV-1 proteins, unlike the parvovirus B19 infection, does not induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [22] . In contrast, two recent studies have shown that the DNA damage repair system is involved in HBoV-1 replication [58, 59] . Thereby the hallmarks of the DDR response, the phosphorylation of H2AX and RPA32, are activated accompanied by the activation of all three PI3KKs. In addition, the polymerases Pol-\u03b7 and Pol-\u03ba, both being part of the DNA repair system, are recruited to the viral replication sites, thus providing additional evidence that parvovirus DNA replication has to occur in cell cycle-arrested cells.",

Thereby it is worth to note that tonsils are suspected to be a major site of persistence as hypothesized by Clement and colleagues [139] . Subsequently the virus most likely initiates a downstream infection caused by swallowing of viruscontaining secretions, which then enter the gastrointestinal tract where active viral replication occurs and is accompanied by a true viremia. Persistence of HBoV in the respiratory tract has been confirmed by a novel pyrosequencing approach by Wagner and co-workers, who observed primary infections and recurrence in a large cohort of paediatric patients [140] .",

The HBoVdependent regulated cytokines furthermore include a subset of cytokines which are known to be involved in several cancer-associated pathways, supporting the hypothesis that HBoV may be associated with chronic diseases or even cancerogenesis [144] [145] [146] . Although this hypothesis requires further prospective studies, HBoV DNA was detected in lung and colorectal tumours. Detection of HBoV DNA, eventually associated with persistence, has been described in addition to detection in normal lung tissue [119] and in lung and colorectal tumours [146, 147] . HBoV-1 has been detected in other tissues such as tonsils [35, 139, 148, 149] and myocardium and may affect additional tissues that have not yet been tested for HBoV positivity.",

Moreover, fibrosis is related to expression of TNF and IL-8; it is worth noting that the neutralization of TARC leads to a reduction of fibrosis in the animal model [151, 153] .

This data leads to the conclusion that HBoV colonization/chronic infection may be at least one trigger that could stimulate airway remodelling. However, it could be argued that not only the resident airway epithelial cells are involved in the in vivo immune response, but also additional patient-specific factors will contribute to altered profibrotic cytokine profiles. In order to address this problem, experiments in an air-liquid interface culture of human airway epithelial cells were performed. These experiments confirmed that profibrotic cytokines were expressed by the infected cell cultures but were minimally or not at all expressed in mock-infected cells; the identified cytokines belong to the initial immune response following HBoV infection [123] .",

Nowadays, multiple infections with up to six pathogens being simultaneously present in a single respiratory sample are frequent [67, [159] [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] and may mislead some researcher to claim that the human bocavirus, also occurring in asymptomatic patients, is a harmless bystander rather than a pathogen [165, 166] . This hypothesis seems to be supported by the fact that a formal fulfilment of Koch's modified postulates was not yet possible for HBoV [167] , as no animal model exists to date and volunteer transmission trials cannot be recommend based on our current knowledge of this virus [145] .",

The asymptomatic viral shedding is meanwhile believed to originate from long-term shedding after an acute infection or from persistent viruses [34, 35, 95, 137, [177] [178] [179] [180] . This has most recently been confirmed by a long-term prospective cohort study [67, 181] . Thereby it was shown that the rate of asymptomatic HBoV infections is similar to the rate of rhinovirus infections and no one would doubt that rhinoviruses are true pathogens [67] . Finally, HBoV is known to induce serious cytopathic effects in infected cell cultures, which is a typical feature of a pathogen [21, 40, 57, 177] .",

However, multiplexing solely allows detection of the viral DNA in a respiratory sample without providing the essential information as to whether an active replicative infection underlies the currently clinical episode requiring laboratory testing [67] . As HBoV can be shedded for longer than 3 months after the acute symptomatic phase [67] , a proper diagnostics of human bocavirus requires the proof of active replication, which can be done either by detection of a viremia in the peripheral blood [91, 107, 115, 137, [183] [184] [185] [186] [187] or by detection of spliced viral RNA transcripts that were shown to be present exclusively during the active phase of the replication [188] . Recently, a novel rapid antigen test was developed which could be a major advance in HBoV diagnostics [189] . Further progress in this direction can be expected from novel approaches to test for human antibodies and bocviral antigens from all four subtypes based on yeast-derived virus-like particles [190] .",
