In this era of lockdown policies in most of the major cities around the world, we see a huge increase in people and professionals' engagement in social media. Social media is playing an important role in news propagation as well as keeping people in contact. At the same time, this source is both a blessing and a curse as the coronavirus infodemic has become a major concern, and is already a topic that needs special attention and further research. In this paper, we provide a multilingual coronavirus (COVID-19) Instagram dataset that we have been continuously collected since March 30, 2020. We are making our dataset available to the research community at https://github.com/kooshazarei/COVID-19-InstaPostIDs. We believe that this contribution will help the community to better understand the dynamics behind this phenomenon in Instagram, as one of the major social media. This dataset could also help study the propagation of misinformation related to this outbreak.",

To be able to collect Instagram public content (in the shape of post), we use the official Instagram APIs [16] .

This API returns public photos and videos that have been tagged with particular hashtags. MongoDB is used as the core database and data is stored as JSON records. The crawler is responsible for gathering both posts and reactions. A reaction can be active (comment) or passive (like). As it is infeasible to collect all reactions, in this dataset, we define a limitat of 500 comments and 500 likes per post. Our crawler is running on several virtual machines in parallel 24/7. Note that we do not manually filter any posts and therefore we gather all posts containing the hashtags, regardless of the specific topics discussed within.

These have the capacity of amplify misinformation or even act against public health policies (e.g. encourgaging a breakdown in social distancing). We posit that the data could be used to explore the role of bots in this dissemination. 3) Behavioral change analysis during the pandemic: The social distancing measures are created an unprecedented change to millions of people's lives. Understanding the behavioral consequences of this is vital for understanding things like adherence to social distancing policies and mental health consequences. 4) Information sharing related Covid-19: Information flow is vital during periods of emergency. We posit that the dataset can be used to understand the flow of information, as well as people's reactions to such information.",

This is the first version of the dataset and we are still collecting data. Hence, we hope to make further versions available in the coming weeks and months. We publish this dataset in agreement with Instagram's Terms & Conditions [21] , and as it is not possible to release the post content and reactions, we just distribute the post ID's. These are known as the shortcodes. Researchers can then simply retrieve post content through IDs by the help of some open-source projects such as Instaloader [22] that have been developed for such purposes.
