Mathematical modeling of spreading of infectious diseases is a well-established field [1] [2] . There have been a large number of recent efforts in modelling Coronavirus spreading as reported in the literature [3] [4] [5] [6] . The Covid-19 cases have put significant strain in the hospital systems around the world. It would be of great benefit to the medical care facilities if the Covid-19 patient load could be known six weeks in advance. This would enable distributing case load among hospitals and to adequately equip the hospitals with staffing, PPE and life support equipment. This is the objective of this paper.",

These three are (1) the first date of implementation of social distancing protocols since the viral outbreak, (2) the rate at which the rate of transmission decreases by using the government measures and (3) the final rate of transmission in the long run. The California data could be fitted well with March 14 th to be the first date (n 1 ) of transmission rate decrease, 16 days for exponential time constant for transmission rate decrease (G) and 4.5% for the final transmission rate (T f ). The comparison between the model predictions and actual data on number of cases and deaths are shown in figures 1 and 2 respectively. The figures demonstrate that the model fits the actual data very well. Having anchored the model to actual data until May 10 th , we are in a position to make reliable projections for six weeks in advance. The model predicts the number of cases to rise to between 120,000 and 145,000 and the number of deaths to rise to between 5,000 and 5,800 on June 30 th , 2020. The model also predicts the daily number of cases to fall to 640 and the number of daily deaths to fall to 25 on the same date. Figure 3 shows the comparison between the model predictions and actual data [8] on number of hospitalizations until May 10 th . We analyzed the data in [8] to determine daily variation of hospitalization rate and the ratio of ICU beds to the total number of hospital beds. The model fits the data very well as shown in figure 3 by assuming 35% of the patients require ICU beds. The model predicts the number of hospitalizations to decrease from 3,248 on May 10 th to 2,000 on May 31 st and to 1,050 on June 30 th , 2020. The number of ICU beds also will decrease from 1,093 on May 10 th to 700 on May 31 st and to 360 on June 30 th , 2020",

It may also happen that social distancing measures are lifted due to economic or social necessities before the virus is completely extinguished within the population, which would cause \u03a4 n to rise again from \u03a4 f which may lead to a recurrence.

During the first outbreak of the virus, it takes several days to identify the new virus and to develop an initial test, during which period the testing rate of the patients showing symptoms is low, denoted by \u03b2 0 . Let n \u03b2 be the number of days to ramp up the testing of the patients with symptoms to 100% final testing rate . The testing rate \u03c3 n for the general population including those who are infected and not showing symptoms is assumed to be zero until n = n 2 + n \u03b2 and let W be number of days it takes to build up the testing capability to test the general population at a final rate of \u03c3 f .

These three countries in three continents had very different outcomes of Covid-19 cases and provide a good basis to anchor the model which is designed to be applicable to any country. We collected the data on cumulative total number of cases and deaths for these countries from reliable sources [7-9,13-16] for the period January 1 st , 2020 to May 8 th , 2020. We assumed that the aforementioned data sources were reliable and did not verify the accuracy of the data in the datasets. The actual data used in this paper is included in table I in the appendix for the reader to verify. In some cases there is available data on number of recovered cases and active cases. Due to different definitions used in different countries for the criteria used for recovered cases and active cases, we placed much less emphasis on the data on active and recovered cases.",

The strength of this model is that it is based on parameters which can be measured. In the beginning of the virus outbreak, the parameter values are not well known. However in the long run, the parameters values can be extracted from the actual data and the errors in model predictions can be reduced. We start with reasonable assumptions for each parameter and then use the model to fit the published data on total and daily numbers of cases and deaths for each country to iteratively optimize the values of some of the parameters. At the end of iterations, the parameter values that best fit the country data are obtained. With these parameters values, we are in a position (1) to predict the number of cases and required number of hospital beds and All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

When the daily values of these parameters become available on a later date, these can be inserted in the model. For each parameter such as j and m mentioned above there is a range of values. In the model, we used one constant value for each parameter which is very reasonable approximation at this stage of data availability.",

Starting with reasonable initial conditions in the model, iterations are made in the algorithm until the residual errors in fitting the published data during Jan 1 st and May 8 th 2020 for each country are minimized. At that point the final values of all parameters for this predictive model for each country become available. Once the optimization is completed, the model becomes powerful to yield information such as (1) predicted number of future cases, (2) sensitivity analysis such as the effect of delay in taking initial measures, and (3) recurrence of the disease. We discuss the results in the next section. Figure 5 shows the comparison between the Covid-19 case data and the model prediction for Italy. The first reported Covid-19 case in Italy was on Feb 15 th , 2020. There were 3 total cases on Feb 19 and the first death was on Feb 21. The model fitted the Italy Covid-19 case data with Feb 22 start date for transmission factor decrease when the number of cases was 79 and a transmission decay rate of 1/G, where G= 14. The model fits the data very well. The model predicts the number of cases to rise to between 232,000 and 239,000 and the number of deaths to rise to between 34,000 and 35,000 on June 30 th , 2020.",

The daily case data for South Korea has been available since Feb 15 th . There were 28 total cases on Feb 15 th and the first Covid-19 death was on Feb 20 th .

Unless there is a recurrence, the model does not predict any significant rise in number of cases or deaths by June 30 th , 2020. Comparing model parameters for Italy and South Korea, we found that the number of cases were lower when T n started decreasing and G was smaller for South Korea. Figure 7 shows the comparison of the actual data and the model predictions for New Zealand which had a factor of seven less number of cases than South Korea. The daily case data for New Zealand became available since Mar 6 th on which date there were 4 total cases. The first Covid-19 death was on Mar 28 th . The model fitted the New Zealand Covid-19 data using the start date of reduction in T n when the total number of reported cases was only 8, and the transmission factor to decay in G= 10 days. Unless there is a recurrence, the model does not predict any significant rise in number of cases or deaths in New Zealand by June 30 th , 2020. Comparing data from Italy, South Korea and New Zealand, the model makes it obvious that when a country takes timely, swift and uniform virus containment measures at the point when the total number of cases is small, the number of infected cases and deaths are small. It is very similar to containment strategy for wildfire: sooner to detect, sooner to start containment, the less the spread and the resulting destruction. Even a day of waiting makes a big difference in the case of Coronavirus. In the model, transmission factors started reducing for Italy, South Korea and New Zealand when the total cases were 79, 31 and 8 respectively.",
