            "text": "The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) likely occurred from a zoonotic transmission in China in December 2019, linked to a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals. The causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is capable of human-to-human transmission and spread rapidly to other parts of China and then to other locations. By 24 March 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had infected more than 381,000 people across 195 countries/regions and killed more than 16,000: a pandemic as declared by the World Health Organization1. Daily reports of sharp rises in the number of new cases continue to emerge from many countries/regions, but efforts to overcome the virus are hampered by a lack of knowledge of several important aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, ranging from pathogen biology to host response and treatment options. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the host\u2013pathogen biology of COVID-19 as this will offer important insights into treatment and management of the disease, including identification of new therapies. Here, we review the literature on SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology, its interaction with target cells and the immune response to the virus, including the contribution of dysfunctional immune responses to disease progression. Specifically, we highlight the implications of specific features of the infection for promising therapeutic interventions that could target the virus or the dysfunctional immune response. Moreover, we discuss how studies focused on the adaptive immune response will be crucial in informing the development of vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.",

However, there are three coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2) that can replicate in the lower respiratory tract and cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus. Its closest relative among human coronaviruses is SARS-CoV, with 79% genetic similarity3. However, among all known coronavirus sequences, SARS-CoV-2 is most similar to bat coronavirus RaTG13, with 98% similarity4, and coronavirus sequences in the pangolin (a scaly anteater) also share high similarity5.",

As SARS-CoV-2 uses the same entry receptor, these cell subsets are likely targeted by this virus4,27,28. SARS-CoV infection reduces ACE2 expression in lung cells. Because loss of pulmonary ACE2 function is associated with acute lung injury, virus-induced ACE2 downregulation may be important for disease pathology29\u201332. ACE2 has been shown to regulate the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS)32. Therefore, a reduction in ACE2 function after viral infection could result in a dysfunction of the RAS, which influences blood pressure and fluid/electrolyte balance, and enhance inflammation and vascular permeability in the airways.",

The spike (S) protein is expressed on the surface of the virus particles, giving the characteristic \u2018crown\u2019 appearance. The S protein comprises two subunits: S1 and S2. The S1 subunit consists of an amino-terminal domain and a receptor-binding domain (RBD), which in SARS-CoV spans from amino acid residue 318 to amino acid residue 510 (refs35\u201337). The RBD binds to ACE2 as its host cell target receptor, which starts the infection process4. RBD binding to ACE2 triggers endocytosis of the SARS-CoV-2 virion and exposes it to endosomal proteases38. The S2 subunit consists of a fusion peptide (FP) region and two heptad repeat regions: HR1 and HR2 (refs39,40). Within the endosome, the S1 subunit is cleaved away, exposing the fusion peptide, which inserts into the host membrane. The S2 region then folds in on itself to bring the HR1 and HR2 regions together. This leads to membrane fusion and releases the viral package into the host cytoplasm.",

Currently, there are compounds that target these molecules that have been clinically approved for other indications. For example, machine learning algorithms predicted that baricitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, could inhibit ACE2-mediated endocytosis45. Another JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib, will be tested in clinical trials for treatment of COVID-19 later this year46. An alternative strategy is to deliver high concentrations of a soluble form of ACE2 that could potentially reduce virus entry into target host cells. This principle is being tested with APN01, a recombinant form of ACE2 developed by APEIRON that is currently in clinical trials47. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the S protein may also inhibit virus entry or fusion and are further discussed in the section entitled B cell immunity. Nafamostat mesylate48,49 and camostat mesylate44 are known inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and are currently approved in several countries/regions to treat other conditions. While there are no clinical trials specifically testing these drugs against COVID-19 at the time of writing, when camostat mesylate was tested on SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a patient, it prevented entry of the virus into lung cells44,50. If this approach is validated, rapid repurposing of these drugs will be effective and timely in the fight against COVID-19.",

Viral infection and replication in airway epithelial cells52 could cause high levels of virus-linked pyroptosis with associated vascular leakage, as seen in patients with SARS-CoV53. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death that is commonly seen with cytopathic viruses54. This is a likely trigger for the subsequent inflammatory response55. IL-1\u03b2, an important cytokine released during pyroptosis, is elevated during SARS-CoV-2 infection11. Using a variety of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages detect the released pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as viral RNA, and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including ATP, DNA and ASC oligomers. A wave of local inflammation ensues, involving increased secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines IL-6, IFN\u03b3, MCP1 and IP-10 into the blood of afflicted patients11,22. These cytokines are indicators of a T helper 1 (TH1) cell-polarized response, which parallels observations made for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV56. Secretion of such cytokines and chemokines attracts immune cells, notably monocytes and T lymphocytes, but not neutrophils, from the blood into the infected site57,58. Pulmonary recruitment of immune cells from the blood and the infiltration of lymphocytes into the airways may explain the lymphopenia and increased neutrophil\u2013lymphocyte ratio seen in around 80% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection6,59.",

Antagonism occurs at various stages of the interferon signalling pathway, including by preventing PRR recognition of viral RNA63\u201365, by preventing PRR signalling through TBK1/inhibitor of nuclear factor-\u03baB kinase subunit-\u03b5 (IKK\u03b5), TRAF3 and IRF3 (refs63,66), by preventing downstream interferon signalling through STAT1 (ref.67) and by promoting host mRNA degradation and inhibiting host protein translation68. It is very likely that at least some of these pathways are conserved in SARS-CoV-2. Antagonism of the interferon response aids viral replication, resulting in increased release of pyroptosis products that can further induce aberrant inflammatory responses.",

These may result in myocardial damage and circulatory failure observed in some patients69. Older people (those aged over 60 years) and people with co-morbidities are more likely to develop such a dysfunctional immune response that causes pathology and also fails to successfully eradicate the pathogen. The exact reasons for this are unclear, although one reason may be an ageing lung microenvironment causing altered dendritic cell maturation and migration to the lymphoid organs70, and thereby defective T cell activation. In contrast, children tend not to develop severe disease despite being capable of experiencing high viral titres71. Across all age groups younger than 18 years, more than 50% of children experienced mild symptoms or were asymptomatic, with less than 6% of children developing severe symptoms72. Thus, while the aforementioned studies represent important inroads, a full picture of the critical host immune factors that underlie the development of severer inflammatory responses in some patients remains poorly defined.",

The peak of viral titres in respiratory tract samples might occur even before symptom onset of pneumonia in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections17,19. However, a large retrospective cohort study showed that viral RNA was detectable in non-survivors up until the point of death, suggesting a correlation between virus persistence and poor disease outcome60. As viral RNA may linger even after active infection, and is not representative of the infectivity of the virus, whether the poor disease outcome is directly due to large amounts of infectious particles is speculative at this moment. Furthermore, earlier studies of SARS-CoV found that the virus may infect other targets besides lung cells. Notably, virus was found in T lymphocytes73, macrophages74\u201376 and monocyte-derived dendritic cells77. Direct virus killing of lymphocytes could contribute to the observed lymphopenia in patients73. Viral infection in immune cells such as monocytes and macrophages can result in aberrant cytokine production, even if viral infection is not productive74\u201377. The degree to which SARS-CoV-2 targets these cells remains poorly defined. Understanding the precise drivers of immune dysfunction is crucial to guide the application of appropriate immunomodulatory treatments.",

A clinical trial of the IL-6 antagonist tocilizumab is also under way to test its efficacy81, and sarilumab is also being explored82. Other clinical trials are also testing the effects of targeting granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), including the use of gimsilumab83, lenzilumab84 and namilumab85. Another novel adjunctive therapy is cytosorb86, which acts by absorbing a broad spectrum of cytokines, DAMPs and PAMPs in order to reduce their circulating levels and ameliorate immunopathology. Thalidomide, an agent with immunomodulatory properties, has also been successfully administered to a single patient with COVID-19 (ref.87). As a result, two clinical trials have now been initiated to test its potential to reduce lung injury88,89. TNF antagonism was suggested but not tested in the context of SARS-CoV infection, and it has not yet been tested in patients with COVID-19 (ref.90). A small open-label, non-randomized study suggested that a combination of hydroxychloroquine (a known antimalarial agent) and azithromycin (a common antibiotic) may be beneficial for treating patients with severe COVID-19 (ref.91). Although hydroxychloroquine\u2019s effect on direct inhibition of the virus92 and its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities are known93, whether these mechanisms play a role against COVID-19 remains to be determined94.",

CD8+ T cells are important for directly attacking and killing virus-infected cells, whereas CD4+ T cells are crucial to prime both CD8+ T cells and B cells. CD4+ T cells are also responsible for cytokine production to drive immune cell recruitment. The first autopsy of a patient with COVID-19 revealed an accumulation of mononuclear cells (likely monocytes and T cells) in the lungs, coupled with low levels of hyperactive T cells in the peripheral blood57. Together with reports of lymphopenia and reduced peripheral T cell levels in patients 6,95\u201397, these findings suggest that T cells are attracted away from the blood and into the infected site to control the viral infection. In patients with COVID-19, increased T cell exhaustion and reduced functional diversity predicted severe disease98. Despite the impaired response, patients who recovered from SARS-CoV infection developed coronavirus-specific memory T cells, which were found up to 2 years after recovery99,100.",

Efforts are under way to develop therapeutic monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, using approaches including phage library display, traditional mouse immunization and hybridoma isolation, and cloning of B cell sequences from convalescent human patients129\u2013132. SARS-CoV does not appear to have strong mechanisms to escape or prevent antibody neutralization, such as glycan shielding of the receptor-binding site against antibody binding133. This is further corroborated by the fact that patients with SARS-CoV infection were generally capable of developing neutralizing antibodies. A recombinant S protein fragment that included the RBD of SARS-CoV showed the highest immunogenicity relative to other recombinant S protein fragments tested, suggesting that the immune system is capable of targeting neutralizing epitopes effectively134. Thus, if SARS-CoV-2 behaves like SARS-CoV in this respect, it is likely that these efforts will be successful in developing neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.",

For example, pre-existing antibodies to other coronaviruses may exacerbate SARS-CoV infections through antibody-dependent enhancement138\u2013140. Also, previous studies in animal models showed that in SARS-CoV infection, neutralizing antibodies to S protein can potentially augment severe lung injury by exacerbating inflammatory responses141. In addition, a correlation has been observed where development of ARDS coincides with antiviral IgG seroconversion in 80% of patients19. Patients who developed neutralizing antibodies to S protein earlier in infection had a higher rate of disease; it took an average of only 14.7 days for patients who died of infection to reach their peak levels of neutralizing antibody activity, as opposed to 20 days for patients who went on to recover142. Similarly, for MERS, patients with severer disease appear to have higher antibody titres than those with mild disease143,144, although one study argues that it is a delay in the development of antibody responses that is associated with disease145. The binding of antibody\u2013virus immune complexes to activating Fc receptors on alveolar macrophages could induce the expression of pro-inflammatory factors, including IL-8 and MCP1, which add to the immunostimulatory milieu146. Such complexes may also activate the complement system and lead to further unwanted inflammation141. As a result, it is important to consider engineering therapeutic antibodies with little or no pro-inflammatory activity but that retain their virus-neutralizing capacity147. For instance, alterations could be made to the Fc region and/or its glycosylation to change its binding affinity for activating Fc receptors146,148.",

Further studies of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 are necessary, including a detailed investigation of the determinants of healthy versus dysfunctional outcomes.

These are recognized by neighbouring epithelial cells, endothelial cells and alveolar macrophages, triggering the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (including IL-6, IP-10, macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 (MIP1\u03b1), MIP1\u03b2 and MCP1). These proteins attract monocytes, macrophages and T cells to the site of infection, promoting further inflammation (with the addition of IFN\u03b3 produced by T cells) and establishing a pro-inflammatory feedback loop. In a defective immune response (left side) this may lead to further accumulation of immune cells in the lungs, causing overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which eventually damages the lung infrastructure. The resulting cytokine storm circulates to other organs, leading to multi-organ damage. In addition, non-neutralizing antibodies produced by B cells may enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), further exacerbating organ damage. Alternatively, in a healthy immune response (right side), the initial inflammation attracts virus-specific T cells to the site of infection, where they can eliminate the infected cells before the virus spreads. Neutralizing antibodies in these individuals can block viral infection, and alveolar macrophages recognize neutralized viruses and apoptotic cells and clear them by phagocytosis. Altogether, these processes lead to clearance of the virus and minimal lung damage, resulting in recovery. G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; TNF, tumour necrosis factor.",
