            "text": "The challenge to produce effective and safe vaccines for the currently prevalent infectious diseases of humans and animals has become increasingly difficult (Bloom, 1994; Cohen, 1994; Stratton et al., 1994). In veterinary medicine, evidence implicating vaccines in triggering immune-mediated and other chronic disorders (vaccinosis) is growing (Dodds, 1983, 1993, 1995a, 1997; Phillips and Schultz, 1992; Alderink et al., 1995; Schultz, 1995a,b; Duval and Giger, 1996). Although some of these problems have been traced to contaminated or poorly attenuated batches of vaccine that revert to virulence, others apparently reflect the host's genetic predisposition to react adversely on receiving the monovalent or polyvalent products given routinely to animals (Dodds, 1983, 1993, 1995a,b,c, 1997; Oehen et al., 1991; Lumsden et al., 1993; Wilbur et al., 1994; Gloyd, 1995; Smith, 1995; Wynn and Dodds, 1995).",

(predictive causality) (Stratton et al., 1994). Other factors to be weighed in considering the implications of causality include prevalence and clinical severity of the naturally occurring infectious disease, implementing more effective strategies to control infectious diseases, vaccine-related issues such as dosage in relation to body mass and age, advantages and disadvantages of modified live (attenuated) and killed (inactivated) vaccines, hormonal state during vaccination (Smith et al., 1990), and periodicity of booster vaccinations in relation to duration of immunity (Dodds, 1997). Alternatives to current vaccine practices include measuring serum antibody titers; avoidance of unnecessary vaccines or overvaccinating; caution in vaccinating sick, very old, debilitated, or febrile individuals, and families known to be at high risk for immunologic reactions; and use of homeopathic nosodes either as preventive or therapeutic adjuncts. (This last option is considered an unconventional treatment that has not been proven scientifically to be efficacious. If veterinarians choose to use homeopathic nosodes, their clients should be provided with an appropriate disclaimer and written informed consent should be obtained.) A multifaceted approach is needed to further recognition of this situation, along with implementing alternative strategies to contain infectious diseases and reduce the environmental impact of conventional vaccines.",

The increasing antigenic load presented to the host individual by modified live virus (MLV) vaccines during the period of viremia is presumed to be responsible for the immunologic challenge that can result in a delayed hypersensitivity reaction (Tizard, 1990; Phillips and Schultz, 1992).",

            "text": "These adverse vaccine reactions typically include fever, stiffness, sore joints and abdominal tenderness, susceptibility to infections, neurologic disorders and encephalitis, collapse with autoagglutinated red blood cells and icterus (autoimmune hemolytic anemia, AIHA), or generalized petechiae and ecchymotic hemorrhages (immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, ITP) (Dodds, 1983, 1993, 1995b, 1997; Jones, 1984; Phillips and Schultz, 1992; Littledike, 1993; May et al., 1994; Gloyd, 1995; Duval and Giger, 1996). Liver enzymes may be markedly elevated, and liver or kidney failure may occur by itself or accompany bone marrow suppression. Furthermore, MLV vaccination has been associated with the development of transient seizures in puppies and adult dogs of breeds or cross-breeds susceptible to immune-mediated diseases especially those of hematologic or endocrine tissues (e.g., AIHA, ITP, autoimmune thyroiditis) (Dodds, 1983, 1993, 1995b). Postvaccinal polyneuropathy is a recognized entity associated occasionally with the use of distemper, parvovirus, rabies, and presumably other vaccines (Tizard, 1990; Phillips and Schultz, 1992; Dodds, 1993; Collins, 1994; Gloyd, 1995). This can result in various clinical signs including muscular atrophy, inhibition or interruption of neuronal control of tissue and organ function, muscular excitation, incoordination and weakness, as well as seizures (Dodds, 1993, 1997). Adverse reactions to vaccination also have been reported recently with increasing frequency in cats (Rosenthal and Dworkis, 1990; Kahler, 1993; Kass et al., 1993). Accordingly, companion animal breeders should be advised of the potential for genetically susceptible littermates and relatives to be at increased risk for similar adverse vaccine reactions (Dodds, 1983, 1993, 1995a,b; Schultz, 1995b).",

Commercial vaccines can also be contaminated with other adventitious viral agents, presumably as a result of inadequate quality control during vaccine production (DVM Vaccine Roundtable, 1989; Tizard, 1990; Wilbur et al., 1994; Ellis et al., 1995a). This has been of particular concern in cattle where contamination of bovine respiratory disease and rotacoronavirus vaccines with bovine viral diarrhea virus has occurred with unacceptable frequency (DVM Vaccine Roundtable, 1988; Ellis et al., 1995a; Cortese et al., 1997). Another serious problem arose from a commercial canine parvovirus vaccine that was contaminated by blue tongue virus, as it produced abortion and death when given to pregnant dogs (Wilbur et al., 1994). The authors linked the causality here to the ill-advised but all too common practice of vaccinating pregnant animals. The potential for side effects such as promotion of chronic disease states in male and nonpregnant female dogs receiving this lot of vaccine remains in question, although there have been anecdotal reports of reduced stamina and renal dysfunction in performance sled dogs (J. L. Olson, unpublished observations, 1995). Recently, a commercial manufacturer of distemper vaccines had to recall all of its biologic products containing a distemper component, because the vaccines were associated with a higher than normally observed rate of central nervous system postvaccinal reactions 1\u20132 weeks following administration (Gloyd, 1995).",

            "text": "Overvaccination raises other issues; the increased cost in time and dollars spent needs to be considered, despite the well-intentioned solicitation of clients to encourage annual booster vaccinations so that pets also can receive a wellness examination (Smith, 1995). Giving annual boosters when they are not necessary has the client paying for a service that is likely to be of little benefit to the pet's existing level of protection against these infectious diseases. It also increases the risk of adverse reactions from the repeated exposure to foreign substances (Smith, 1995; Alderink et al., 1995). Vaccination leads to false-positive serologic test results in viral or bacterial screening assays [e.g., feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline coronavirus, canine borreliosis]. The experts agree that certain vaccines such as canine coronavirus, Lyme disease, and the commercially available Leptospira bacterins have little justification for their widespread use (Greene, 1992), while others so rarely cause disease today (e.g., infectious canine hepatitis) that their need is questionable (Alderink et al., 1995). Furthermore, only cats at high risk of exposure really need to be vaccinated for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) or FeLV (Scott and Geissinger, 1997). A controversial canine and feline ringworm vaccine has been marketed, and a canine rotavirus vaccine is being introduced, although there is no recognized canine rotavirus disease beyond the newborn stage. An important point, raised by Dennis W. Macy in the editorial of Smith (1995), is the fallacy of assuming that recommending annual vaccination will cause a greater percentage of the pet population to be vaccinated. What actually happens is that conscientious clients come in regularly and their pets get overvaccinated with the attendant higher risk of adverse reaction.",

However, this can overwhelm the immunocompromised or even a healthy host that has ongoing exposure to other environmental stimuli as well as a genetic predisposition that promotes adverse response to viral challenge (Brenner et al., 1988; Garenne et al., 1991, Phillips and Schultz, 1992; Dodds, 1993, 1997; Allen et al., 1996). The recently weaned young puppy or kitten being placed in a new environment may be at particular risk. Furthermore, while the frequency of vaccinations is usually spaced 2\u20133 weeks apart, some veterinarians have advocated vaccination once a week in stressful situations (McDonald, 1992; Smith, 1995). This practice makes little sense scientifically or medically, as the relatively immature immune systems of young animals may be temporarily or more permanently harmed (Schultz, 1995a,b). One could even envision the consequences of increased susceptibility to chronic debilitating diseases in later life.",

Three of the four had elevated thyroglobulin autoantibodies, and two had thyroid biopsies, which confirmed lymphocytic thyroiditis. Von Willebrand factor antigen levels were also low (< 50%) or borderline normal (50\u201369%) in this litter. Other immediate family members were also affected. The sire and two litterbrothers of the dam had thyroid disease, and the dam had low von Willebrand factor antigen (31%), abnormal thyroid function tests, and elevated circulating T3 autoantibody and thyroglobulin autoantibody. The maternal grandsire also had elevated thyroglobulin autoantibodies; and the maternal great granddam produced a daughter with thyroid disease that progressed to thyroid adenocarcinoma at age 10 years. This female's paternal grandsire was the foundation sire of many dogs affected with AIHA and/or ITP and his littersister had died of AIHA. These dogs represented a closely related subset of the larger study summarized by Dodds (1995b).",

Juvenile-onset IMPA occurs in Akitas less than 8 months of age. This author initially studied eight affected Akitas puppies, in collaboration with Susan Wynn (Wynn and Dodds, 1995), and five of them were closely related. Affected dogs exhibit signs of profound joint pain and cyclic febrile illness lasting 24\u201348 hours. The mean age of onset was 14 weeks, with all dogs showing signs by 16 weeks of age. Three were male, and five were female. The dogs consistently exhibited cyclic febrile illness with signs of severe pain, usually related to the joints. Most of the dogs had elevated hepatic enzymes, creatine kinase, and blood urea nitrogen. Three of the dogs tested had low thyroid hormone levels (T4, free T4, T3). Screening for rickettsial diseases was negative. One dog was ANA positive at 1:40. Hemograms revealed mild nonregenerative anemia, neutrophilic leukocytosis, and occasional thrombocytopenia. Joint aspiration and radiography of three dogs indicated nonseptic, nonerosive arthritis. Juvenile IMPA in Akitas is a syndrome distinct from the nonerosive, noninfectious, non-neoplastic polyarthritis seen in other breeds. Affected Akitas show signs of the disease at a much earlier age, and the syndrome is heritable (Dougherty and Center, 1991). The mechanism of disease development has not been elucidated, but it shares several features with the inherited renal amyloidosis and recurrent fever of unknown origin syndrome of Chinese shar pei dogs (May et al., 1992; Rivas et al., 1993; Zeiss, 1994). This combination of symptoms is reminiscent of familial Mediterranean fever of humans, which has an autosomal recessive inheritance (Rivas et al., 1993).",

Treatment was unsuccessful over the long term, because all dogs had relapsing signs despite symptomatic therapy for immune-mediated disease and pyrexia. All dogs died or were euthanized by 2 years of age following progressive systemic disease and renal failure. Necropsies were performed on three dogs, two of which had glomerular amyloidosis and multisystemic inflammatory lesions. In all dogs with known vaccination histories (seven of eight), the initial signs appeared 3\u201329 days following polyvalent MLV and/or killed virus vaccination with a mean reaction time of 14 days. The history, signs, and close association with immunization suggest that juvenile-onset polyarthritis and subsequent amyloidosis in Akitas may be an autoimmune response triggered by the viral antigens or other components of vaccines (Wynn and Dodds, 1995).",

A group of inherited immunodeficiencies characteristic of certain breeds already has been described (Felsburg and Jezyk, 1982; Felsburg, 1985; Dodds, 1992). Breed-specific disorders with suspected autoimmune etiologies are being reported with increasing frequency (Dodds, 1983, 1995b; Meric et al., 1986; Scott-Moncrieff et al., 1992). The mechanism for induction of immune-mediated disease in these dogs is poorly understood, but predisposing factors have been implicated. Immune-mediated disease may develop in genetically susceptible individuals when triggered by environmental agents that induce nonspecific inflammation and/or molecular mimicry (Dodds, 1983, 1992, 1995b; Barnett and Fujinami, 1992). The combination of these genetic and environmental factors overrides normal self-tolerance, and is most often mediated by T-cell imbalance or dysregulation (Sinha et al., 1990).",

Laboratory assessment of these puppies showed leukocytosis, low plasma protein, neutropenia, and low levels of IgG and IgM.

The answers to this provocative topic generally concur in the affirmative to the first question, but lead to another question concerning the duration of immunity conferred by the currently licensed vaccine components (Alderink et al., 1995). Examples of the newly recommended protocols for cats and dogs include giving the kitten and puppy vaccine series followed by a booster at 1 year of age; further boosters to be given every 3 years until geriatric age, at which time booster vaccination may be unadvisable, especially for animals with aging or other diseases and except where vaccination is required by law. In the intervening years between adult booster vaccinations, and in the case of geriatric pets, humoral immunity can be evaluated by vaccine antibody serology as an indication of the presence of \u201cadequate immune memory.\u201d This latter terminology is generally preferred over the term \u201cprotective immunity\u201d because serum antibody titers may not correlate directly with protection against disease (Olson et al., 1988; Sprent and Tough, 1994; Alderink et al., 1995; Schultz, 1995a,b; Smith, 1995).",

Most veterinarians recommend that annual booster vaccinations be given after completion of the initial vaccine series and continue them throughout old age. An increasing number of experts, however, advocate lengthening the interval between boosters, especially for geriatric animals (Frick and Brooks, 1981; Tizard, 1990; Alderink et al., 1995; Schultz, 1995a,b), while other publications reason that the waning immune function of older animals should be boosted by giving vaccinations more frequently. It seems obvious that the latter suggestion is unwise and unnecessary, especially in light of the long-term immunologic memory elicited by earlier vaccination or exposure (Etlinger et al., 1990; Sprent and Tough, 1994; Alderink et al., 1995).",

            "text": "An in-depth study from Sweden (Olson et al., 1988) examined the duration of serum antibody response to CPV, canine adenovirus 1, and CDV immunizations. Only killed CPV vaccine was used, whereas the CDV vaccine was MLV and the adenovirus 1 was either killed or MLV in origin. Several interesting conclusions arose from this work, which examined several hundred dogs. For adult dogs vaccinated with killed CPV vaccine, there was no significant difference in antibody titer between vaccinated and nonvaccinated animals. While protective levels of immunity induced by the killed vaccine were of relatively short duration, two vaccinations with optimal spacing (21\u201335 days apart) adequately protected against parvovirus disease (Olson et al., 1988). As expected, the MLV CDV and adenovirus 1 vaccines induced more long-lasting protective immunity. Equating the effectiveness of vaccination with humoral antibody concentration alone is fraught with problems, however, because cell-mediated immunity can fully protect against disease in the absence of circulating antibody titers (Schultz, 1995a,b). Regardless of the type of vaccine used, persistence of maternal immunity which interferes with active immunization remains the primary cause of vaccine failures (DVM Vaccine Roundtable, 1988; Greene, 1990, Garenne et al., 1991; McDonald, 1992; Schultz, 1995a,b; Smith, 1995; Hoskins, 1997). Protection afforded by most MLV vaccines and by the MLV vaccines used in the Swedish study lasted at least 3 years (Olson et al., 1988). In humans, once the series of childhood vaccinations is completed, protection against these diseases is generally assumed to be long-lived (Stratton et al., 1994). Furthermore, Etlinger and colleagues (1990) emphasized that long after an individual is vaccinated, immunologic memory will be recalled on renewed exposure to the constituents of the vaccine. Thus, prior immunization can be successfully exploited to elicit memory responses as well as to assist in immunizing individuals against new vaccines (Etlinger et al., 1990; Sprent and Tough, 1994).",

(1988, 1997) stated the protective serum neutralization (SN) titer for canine distemper virus (CDV) to be \u2265 1:16, and the protective hemagglutination inhibition (HA) titer for canine parvovirus (CPV) to be \u22651:80, basically in agreement with earlier published studies from Carmichael at Cornell (1997). Hoskins (1997) agrees with the Cornell group for CPV (HA \u2265 1:80), and further stated that a four-fold increase in titer from before or at vaccination as compared to 3 weeks later affords protection. McMillen et al. (1995) studied humoral and cellular immunity in racing greyhounds given a minimal or intensive vaccination protocol and found little difference in the outcome with respect to titers or immune protection. Both protocols afforded good protective immunity. Their titers for successful immunization were the same as those of the Cornell group for CDV and CPV. Carmichael (1997) stated the ideal protective titer for CDV SN to be >1:100 and for CPV HA to be >1:320. However, he also stated that there is no point or need to booster titers unless HA levels fall below 1:10 or 1:20. Schultz (1995a,b, unpublished observations, 1997) considered a CDV SN titer of 1:40 and a CPV HA titer of 1:160 to be \u201cprotective.\u201d Finally, for cats, the recent paper by Scott and Geissinger (1997) indicated the following protective titers for three common feline viral diseases: feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) \u22651:8, feline herpesvirus (FHV) \u2265 1:2, although any titer is adequate; and feline calicivirus (FCV) \u22651:4.",

            "text": "An argument can be made for vaccinating well-nourished, healthy pet animals only against the clinically important infectious diseases of their species. For the dog, this would include CDV, CPV, and rabies virus; and for the cat, it would include FPV and rabies virus (Alderink et al., 1995; Schultz, 1995a,b; Scott and Geissinger, 1997). Why, then, are we giving animals so many other antigens in polyvalent vaccines, and is this approach really necessary or safe? For example, with respect to Leptospira bacterins, the clinically important serovars are not contained in the currently licensed products, and the antibodies they elicit only last a few months. Similarly, there have been very few clinical cases of infectious canine hepatitis from adenovirus 1 infection, although the standard polyvalent vaccines all contain adenovirus 2 to afford cross-protection. Other vaccine components such as that for Lyme disease need not be used universally, because the disease is limited to certain geographic areas. Use of FeLV vaccines could be reserved for cats that live mostly outdoors or live both indoors and outdoors, and for catteries where new animals are introduced on a regular basis, as their efficacy is only modest and they have been implicated along with rabies vaccine in producing injection-site fibrosarcomas (Kahler, 1993; Kass et al., 1993). Perhaps one way to address these issues would be to offer more individual or dual vaccine components that could be given on alternating years, in between the 3-year booster vaccinations for the clinically important diseases. The overall risk-benefit ratio of using multiple antigen vaccines given simultaneously and repeatedly should be reexamined, although we have the luxury of asking such questions today only because the risk of disease has been effectively reduced by the widespread use of vaccination programs (Alderink et al., 1995; Schultz, 1995a,b; Dodds, 1997).",
