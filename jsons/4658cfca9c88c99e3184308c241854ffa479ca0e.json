            "text": "Background Prolonged empiric antibiotic use, resulting from diagnostic uncertainties, in suspected early onset sepsis (EOS) cases constitutes a significant problem. Unnecessary antibiotic use increases the risk of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, prolonged antibiotic use increases the risk of mortality and morbidity in neonates. Proactive measures including empiric antibiotic de-escalation are crucial to overcome these problems. Methods This was a prospective cohort study conducted in the neonatal intensive care units of two public hospitals in Malaysia. Neonates with a gestational age greater than 34 weeks who were started on empiric antibiotics within 72 h of life were screened. The data were then stratified according to de-escalation and non-de-escalation practices, where de-escalation practice was defined as narrowing down or discontinuation of empiric antibiotic within 72 h of treatment. Results A total of 1045 neonates were screened, and 429 were included. The neonates were then divided based on de-escalation (n = 207) and non-de-escalation (n = 222) practices. Neonates under non-de-escalation practices showed significantly longer durations of antibiotic use compared to those under de-escalation practices (p < 0.05), with no difference in treatment outcomes. Five factors were found to be associated with de-escalation of antibiotics. They are cesarean section delivery, exposure to antenatal steroids, nil history of maternal pyrexia, absence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and normal C-reactive protein \u2264 0.5 mg/dL (p < 0.05). Conclusions Empiric antibiotic de-escalation appears feasible as a routine form of treatment for EOS in late preterm and term neonates.",

Management of suspected EOS in late preterm and term neonates varies widely. In currently published guidelines from medical bodies such as the Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Academy for Pediatrics, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Swiss Society of Neonatology, and the Belgian and Flemish Societies of Neonatology and Paediatrics, there is a lack of consensus regarding the best time to review empiric antibiotic treatment for EOS [3] . In Malaysia, disagreements exist between the 4th edition of Paediatric Protocols and 3rd edition of the National Antibiotic Guideline (NAG), with the time recommended to review empiric treatment in EOS listed as 48-72 h and 36 h, respectively [4] [5] [6] .",

There were no differences in treatment failure between groups. Treatment failure was defined as the reappearance of sepsis 2 weeks after the discontinuation of treatment [17] . Cordero and Ayers (2003) conducted a study on extremely low birth weight (BW) neonates with an average GA of 25-27 weeks. They found that discontinuation of empiric antibiotics when blood culture was negative for \u2264 3 days versus continued for \u2265 7 days resulted in desirable treatment outcomes. Furthermore, mortality was not compromised [18] . Therefore, empiric antibiotic de-escalation in suspected EOS can potentially be implemented, despite wide variations in neonatal GA. Further investigations into this area are needed, including a compilation of evidence from our local setting.",

However, studies have shown that gentamicin's nephrotoxic effect is less frequent in neonates than in adults [27] . Severe cases of EOS require antibiotics with extensive coverage and excellent cerebrospinal fluid penetration properties. Therefore, cefotaxime is an antibiotic of choice. However, cefotaxime use should be restricted due to rapid development of resistance and risk of invasive candidiasis if routinely used for the treatment of EOS [1] . In this study, less than 5% of the total neonates analyzed were exposed to cefotaxime and none of them developed resistance or candidiasis during their NICU stay.",

            "text": "Overall, positive blood culture was reported in less than 2% of total cases in our study. Furthermore, five out of seven pathogens isolated were gram-positive organisms. These results are in line with those obtained from previous studies conducted in Malaysia, Estonia, and the United States, in which positive blood culture was obtained in < 5% of the study population, was rarely reported, and around 70% of causative pathogens were gram positive [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . False-negative blood culture is common in the neonatal population, possibly due to insufficient blood sample volumes [34] or low-density bacteremia due to perinatal antibiotic exposure [35] . As a result, treating EOS in the presence of a negative blood culture remains the normal practice [9, 36, 37] . However, using blood culture to confirm the diagnosis of EOS remains the 'gold standard.' In the future, more advanced methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be useful to improve the EOS diagnosis sensitivity [38] . In our final model, five predictors were identified to be associated with antibiotic de-escalation within 72 h of therapy. They are cesarean section delivery, exposure to antenatal steroids, nil history of maternal pyrexia, absence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and normal baseline CRP. A cesarean section delivery was classified as a cleancontaminated operation, with a risk of infection and endometritis to the operative mother, but no additional risk of EOS to the neonate, since there was no contact with the birth canal during the delivery process [39, 40] . Exposure to antenatal steroids was also a predictive indicator for deescalation practice. To accelerate fetal lung maturation and improve neonatal respiratory function upon delivery, antenatal steroids are given to mothers at risk of premature delivery or elective cesarean before 38 weeks gestation [41] . A study by Gyamfi-Bannerman et al. (2016) at the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development reported that completing two doses of antenatal steroids was not associated with an increased risk of EOS [42] .",

Meconiumstained amniotic fluid was not considered as a criterion to start empiric antibiotics, as meconium aspiration syndrome presented in only 5% of meconium-stained amniotic fluid cases [45, 46] .

            "text": "This study had some limitations because de-escalation or non-de-escalation practices were based on clinician preference and involved only two public hospitals. Therefore, results cannot be generalized. Besides, this study did not use the Kaiser risk assessment calculator to determine whether an antibiotic should be started for EOS [51] . Instead, the criteria used was based on our local reference Paediatric Protocols (4th edition) as this was the reference commonly used by the physicians at our study sites. Hence, there could be a possibility that an antibiotic was started even though the EOS risk was low according to the Kaiser risk assessment. It is not surprising that most of the identified factors in this study are factors currently included in the Kaiser risk assessment. Despite the limitations, to our knowledge, this is the first local study investigating factors associated with empiric antibiotic de-escalation among neonates with suspected EOS.",
