This new symposium is published in part because of readers' requests to once again address antimicrobial drugs, as was done in the Proceedings' Symposium on Antimicrobial Agents, published between October 1998 and February 2000. The new 2011-2012 symposium arrives at an important time for infectious disease management worldwide.",

During that time, the number of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases has substantially increased. Emerging infections are infections that appear for the first time in a population, whereas reemerging infections are known infections that reappear after a decline in incidence or extend their geographic impact. Examples include pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus,2 avian influenza virus,3 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),4 west Nile virus infection,5 and ehrlichiosis.6 A feature of current emerging and reemerging infections is that disease first appearing at one geographic location traverses continents and affects millions of people within a very short period. First reported from Mexico in the spring of 2009, pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection was noted in almost all countries in the world by March 2010, resulting in nearly 18,000 deaths.7 In only a few months, SARS spread from China to 26 countries and affected 8098 people, causing 774 deaths.4",

Both HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths have decreased by nearly 20% worldwide. This decline is attributable in part to access to antiretroviral therapy; in 2009, more than 5 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy.",

By July 2010, 58 countries and territories had reported at least 1 case of extensively drug-resistant TB. Intensive efforts to reduce the global burden of TB are under way. The cornerstone of these efforts is access to quality diagnosis and treatment. Although little progress has been made in the development of new anti-TB drugs, the scale-up of intensive efforts to improve TB care and control globally has resulted in up to 6 million lives being saved.9 The introduction of newer diagnostic modalities, including automated molecular tests that can be used in a resource-limited setting where the burden of TB is the highest, has generated great optimism and excitement.",

Mutations that confer resistance may be passed on to other bacteria of the same species as well as those of different species and genera. Hospital-acquired antibiotic-resistant infections are estimated to cause 100,000 deaths in the United States, with substantial direct and indirect economic costs to the country.11 These antibiotic-resistant infections are caused by a variety of organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant pneumococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and resistant gram-negative bacteria (eg, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase\u2013producing bacteria (eg, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter species).12 Some of the reasons for this epidemic of antibiotic resistance among bacteria include poor infection control practices, injudicious use of antibiotics in human medicine, and injudicious use of antibiotics in agriculture. The problem is further aggravated by the lack of a robust antibiotic drug\u2013development pipeline.",

In the first article, Leekha et al1 discuss general principles of antimicrobial therapy, dispensing pearls of infectious diseases practice that are difficult to find in any other single publication. Subsequent articles address a variety of infectious disease\u2013related topics, ranging from pharmacology of antimicrobial agents to current concepts in the management of various infections, including bacterial, fungal, viral, mycobacterial, and parasitic infections. Topics addressed in this symposium also include laboratory testing to guide antimicrobial therapy, antibiotic prophylaxis, and current concepts in outpatient antibiotic therapy. All articles are authored by experts in the subject matter. As with previous symposia published by Mayo Clinic Proceedings, once all the articles in this Symposium on Antimicrobial Therapy have appeared in the journal, they will be compiled into a book that we hope will serve as a valuable resource to the practicing clinician.",
