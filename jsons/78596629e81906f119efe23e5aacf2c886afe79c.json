An increase in sympathetic stimulation, which is responsible for triggering such arrhythmias, is often resistant to antiarrhythmic treatment. Modulation of the cardiac autonomic nervous system is now being used frequently in the treatment of channelopathy. Cardiac sympathetic denervation (CSD) is carried out via surgical excision or pharmacological inhibition of the extrinsic thoracic sympathetic chain (SC). For this reason, left CSD (LCSD) has been shown to decrease the number of sudden deaths and events in cases of CPVT and LQTS [1] .",

A camera was used to visualize the scene, while the second port was placed into an anterior axillary line through the third ICS. A minimally invasive two-port VATS procedure was performed. Then, CO 2 insufflation was adjusted to a pressure of 6 mmHg. In several patients, it was impossible to achieve sufficient exposure at this pressure, so insufflation was increased up to 8-10 mm Hg. When this failed to result in sufficient exposure, the third port was placed at the fifth ICS through the anterior axillary line to retract the lung.

It has been stated that 46-69% of patients with channelopathy continue to have cardiac events despite maximum therapy [4] . In such cases, ICDs may be used to prevent sudden deaths. Ironically, ICD shocks may trigger arrhythmias depending on the sympathetic stimulation, as they can cause \"electrical storms.\" Furthermore, ICD is not ideal in pediatric patients due to extreme sensitivity to catecholamines released as a consequence of anxiety and pain associated with ICD shocks.",

In addition, it is stated that there is a functional asymmetry in the innervation of the heart. The left sympathetic nerve chain influences the left and posterior walls of heart innervation, and the right sympathetic nerve chain effects heart rate due to its stimulation on the sinus node [21].",

In children, the safety and feasibility of BCSD for the control of ventricular arrhythmias has yet to be clarified [25] . A pediatric case report has suggested that BCSD is more effective than a unilateral operation [27] . In our study, recurrence emerged six months in the first two patients who underwent LCSD; therefore, RCSD was added. Given the multiple appropriate shocks, family concerns, and patient anxiety, the pediatric cardiology and surgical team decided to proceed with BCSD in a single session rather than proceed in a stepwise modality in pediatric patients. After performing BCSD, no recurrence was observed over the course of follow-up. We monitored a rate of full resolution in 60% of cases and a partial (88%) resolution in the remaining 40% of cases. It was thought that BCSD was more effective than LCSD.",

            "text": "Schwartz suggested that RCSD is appropriate in cases in which LCSD is inadequate; however, he did not recommend BCSD as the first-line approach, as it deprives the dysfunctional heart of the potentially beneficial adrenergic discharge of the cardiac sympathetic nerves on the right, affecting both ventricular ability to control heart rate [28] . Complications of LCSD are as follows: unilateral hand dryness, color or temperature variations between the sides of the face, and alterations in sweating patterns [22, 25] . Another advantage of BCSD is that it does not create asymmetric discomfort, which may be caused by LCSD. For example, Antiel et al. conducted LCSD on 20 patients with LQTS and six patients with CPVT, showing that the most prevalent side effects in pediatric patients were unilateral hand dryness (84%), color or temperature differences between the sides of the face (76%), and inordinate sweating (54%) [29] . In our study, alteration in the sweating pattern was spotted in two patients (13.3%); one of them returned to normal after six months. In the literature, the rate of chronic Horner syndrome is 5%, while the rate of temporary signs of Horner syndrome varies from 23% to 48% [9, 17,29,30] . It has been suggested that in order to prevent recurrence, the lower half of the stellate ganglion or the lower third of the stellate ganglion and the T1-T4 ganglions must be denervated [31] . In pediatric patients, Horner syndrome or its signs can be difficult for families to accept and may have psychosocial consequences. In our study, neither chronic nor temporary Horner syndrome, nor any of its signs, were observed in any case. A potentially lower risk of Horner syndrome in our study is not \"an advantage\" of the BCSD surgical technique; rather, it is the result of sparing the stellate ganglion. Our pediatric patients were not put at risk of Horner syndrome or its signs.",
