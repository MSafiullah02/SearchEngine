In addition, clustering of cases in some seasons, few reports suggesting occurrence in families or communities and the clinical presentation with fever, rash and lymphadenopathy, also suggests that it might be an infectious illness. However, till date, no infectious agent has been incriminated with certainty.

In case, however, the child presents late and the acute phase reactants are still elevated or if there are CAAs on echocardiography, IVIg should still be administered. The response to IVIg is often dramatic, and the irritability, so characteristic of KD, often disappears within a few hours of initiation of the infusion. Fever defervescence usually occurs within 12\u201318 h. Administration of IVIg can, on occasions, be associated with significant adverse effects like headache and vomiting. These are thought to be secondary to a mild aseptic meningitis which is known to be associated with administration of IVIg. These can usually be managed quite easily with symptomatic treatment.

The latter is used initially in anti-inflammatory doses initially and then reduced to antiplatelet dose.
