Broad spectrum antibiotics are commonly prescribed. Nosocomial infections are reported during previous coronavirus outbreaks with A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t Abstract Background: To explore and describe the current literature surrounding bacterial/fungal co-infection in patients with coronavirus infection. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched using broad based search criteria relating to coronavirus and bacterial co-infection. Articles presenting clinical data for patients with coronavirus infection (defined as SARS-1, MERS, SARS-COV-2, and other coronavirus) and bacterial/fungal co-infection reported in English, Mandarin, or Italian were included. Data describing bacterial/fungal co-infections, treatments, and outcomes were extracted. Secondary analysis of studies reporting antimicrobial prescribing in SARS-COV-2 even in the absence of co-infection was performed. Results: 1007 abstracts were identified. Eighteen full texts reported bacterial/fungal co-infection were included. Most studies did not identify or report bacterial/fungal coinfection (85/140;61%). 9/18 (50%) studies reported on COVID-19, 5/18 (28%) SARS-1, 1/18 (6%) MERS, and 3/18 (17%) other coronavirus. For COVID-19, 62/806 (8%) patients were reported as experiencing bacterial/fungal co-infection during hospital admission. Secondary analysis demonstrated wide use of broad-spectrum antibacterials, despite a paucity of evidence for bacterial coinfection. On secondary analysis, 1450/2010 (72%) of patients reported received antimicrobial therapy. No antimicrobial stewardship interventions were described.",

[11] It is anticipated that during the epidemic an increased number of patients will require commencement on empirical antimicrobial therapy. Therefore, it is important that antimicrobial stewardship programs focus on supporting the optimal selection of empirical therapies and the rapid de-escalation of treatment once SARS-COV-2 infection is confirmed. Given the suggested use of broad-spectrum agents and macrolides; [9] [10] [11] this is important to prevent unintended consequences of antimicrobial therapy including toxicity (such as QT prolongation), [12] antibiotic associated diarrhoea, and the propagation of antimicrobial resistance through increased usage of antimicrobials within healthcare systems. [13] We performed a review of the medical literature to explore commonly reported bacterial/fungal co-infections in patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus lower respiratory tract infections. Given the lack of data surrounding SARS-COV-2 we also opted to include other coronavirus infections. Whilst acknowledging that evidence may differ between coronavirus infections, we wanted to explore whether similar observations have been made between these infections. We opted to include, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-1), Middle Eastern Respiratory",

Most studies failed to differentiate the setting where sampling was performed (critical versus non-critical care). The largest series reporting bacterial/fungal co-infection was reported by Goyal and colleagues in the USA. [22] In this study, the authors report 19/338 (6%) rate of bacteraemia during hospital admission. It is not clear whether these patients were in critical or non- Selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy for respiratory bacterial/fungal co-infection and recommendations for duration of treatment require several considerations. As the pre-test probability of SARS-COV-2 positive presentations increase, the role of empirical atypical coverage needs to be considered. There have been concerns associated with the potential of sudden cardiac arrest secondary to QT prolongation that is associated with many of the agents we use for atypical infection. [12] The mainstay of treatment for atypical organisms are the macrolides, tetracyclines, and quinolones. Some of these can prolong QT and therefore the potential benefits of such treatment must be carefully balanced against risks. [12] Macrolides have also been associated with potential antiviral effect in combination with hydroxychloroquine, but also have a potential synergistic effect on QT prolongation. [11] Current evidence reported from MERS cohorts does not suggest any added benefit from the use of macrolides in the treatment of ARDS associated with coronavirus infection. [27] Furthermore, very few atypical bacterial co-infections have been identified in reports of COVID-19 cases to date. Therefore, the potential unintended consequences of prolonged macrolide use must be weighed against potential likelihood of atypical bacterial co-infection within COVID-19 cohorts.",

            "text": "Potential stewardship interventions to support reduced antimicrobial prescribing during the COVID-19 pandemic urgently require consideration. [41] Traditional markers used to support antimicrobial decisions, such as vital signs, blood tests like white cell count and C-reactive protein, and imaging tend to be abnormal in SARS-COV-2 infection. [1] [2] [3] This makes decision making surrounding the requirement for empiric antibacterial cover challenging. Furthermore, with fears surrounding prolonged patient contact and aerosol generation, the number of patients undergoing routine microbiological investigation may be reduced. [41] One potential solution to support antimicrobial prescribing in COVID-19 is the use of bacterial specific biomarkers, such as procalcitonin. [42] Procalcitonin has been demonstrated to support differentiation between bacterial and viral infection and supports early cessation of antibiotics in confirmed bacterial infection with no effect on patient mortality. [42, 43] Procalcitonin use has been reported in the COVID-19 literature and may be an important tool to support reducing antimicrobial A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t use. [8, 17, 19, 22, 25, 30, 33] Furthermore, the use of clinical decision support systems may facilitate better use of data in supporting decision making, especially when linked with artificial intelligence. [44] In addition, infection specialties who are normally responsible for co-ordinating stewardship programs must continue to provide support to clinical teams managing COVID-19 patients to ensure that regular review and cessation of antimicrobial therapy is considered based on the limited clinical evidence available within these patients. [41] Supporting appropriate microbiological sampling prior to commencement of antimicrobial therapy should also be encouraged within this patient cohort to ensure that the clinician has as much data as possible to support decision making.",

The second individual with significant microbiology grew a Candida albicans. This organism is not normally regarded as a pathological organism when identified in culture from sputum.[31] Wang and colleagues, reported 29 of 69 patients undergoing sputum culture on admission to hospital to identify respiratory bacterial/fungal co-infection.[8] Of these, 5/69 (7%) had positive microbiology, including Candida albicans (2/5, 40%), Enterobacter cloacae (2/5, 50%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (1/5, 20%).

Of 2010 patients reported within these studies, 1450 (72%) received antibacterial therapy. Where reported, selected agents tended to be broad-spectrum and empiric, being prescribed across critical and non-critical care settings. For example, Cao and colleagues report on 102 patients from critical and non-critical care in China.[40] Of these 101 (99%) received antibacterial therapy.[40] The report 87/102 (85%) receiving quinolone therapy, 34/101 (33%) cephalosporins, and 25/102 (25%) carbapenems. No bacterial/fungal co-infection was reported in this study.[40] Guan and colleagues report on 1099 patients admitted to critical and non-critical care settings in China.[33] Of these 637/1099 (58%) received antibacterial and 31/1099 (3%) antifungal therapy. No microbiology was reported in this study.[33] Complications of antimicrobial therapy were not reported in any study.Reported bacterial/fungal co-infection was greater in other coronavirus studies compared to COVID-19. Overall, 90/815 (11%) of reported patients has identified bacterial/fungal co-infection. In a review of 349 critically ill patients with MERS in Saudi Arabia, Arabi and colleagues identified atypical bacterial co-infection in 5/349 (1%) instances on admission. Atypical organisms identified were Mycoplasma spp. (3/5), Legionella (1/5), and Chlamydia spp (1/5). However, only 6 to 17 patients appear to have been investigated for atypical organisms.[27] This may reflect physician screening preferences based on clinical presentation. Despite low rates of reporting SARS-1 42/135 (31%) of reported cases had bacterial/fungal coinfection. During the SARS-1 outbreak in the early 2000s, Yap and colleagues reported nosocomial infection in a series of 83 patients managed within intensive care. The authors report increased rates of Meticillin Resistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Stenotrophomonas spp., and Acinetobacter baumannii in an intensive care unit that cared for 83 SARS-1 patients during a three-month period.[29] This included 30 episodes of ventilator associated pneumonia and 23 cases of MRSA transmission. This period was associated with significant increases in antimicrobial usage within the intensive care unit.[29] For other coronavirus infections, bacterial/fungal co-infection were observed in 43/331(13%) of cases.[10,20,23] These co-infections were for a range of Grampositive (10/43, 23%), Gram-negative (23/43, 53%), and atypical bacteria (10/43, 23%).
