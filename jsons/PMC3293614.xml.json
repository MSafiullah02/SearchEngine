            "text": "Researchers have been searching for new and improved methods to efficiently alter gene expression for decades. The landmark discovery in 1998 identifying double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a sequence-specific, mRNA-interfering species1 triggered studies in a variety of systems that uncovered evolutionary conservation of some form of RNA interference (RNAi) across almost all phyla. Mechanistically, RNAi is now well-understood and numerous review articles are available that provide the reader with a thorough understanding of the basic biochemistry involved.2,3,4 Briefly, 21-nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes are the functional molecules that provide sequence-specific target selection and subsequent mRNA cleavage when part of the multicomponent RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).5,6 The characteristic 2-nt overhangs at the 3\u2032-ends of each strand are recognized by the PAZ domain of Argonaute 2 (Ago2) which is a key protein component of RISC. PAZ domain-binding aids in orienting the siRNA in RISC, defining polarity. Loaded RISC scans available mRNA sequences and Ago2 mediates cleavage of the mRNA where sufficient homology exists to the siRNA guide strand. This initial cleavage event converts the mRNA into a substrate for further degradation by cellular 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-exonucleases. Importantly, administration of siRNAs in cell culture can achieve IC50 values in the low picomolar range, demonstrating that RNAi is a very potent mechanism of gene inhibition. These factors are favorable for therapeutics and have been significant drivers motivating development of methods to use RNAi in vivo.",

            "text": "More advanced predictive models (\u201csecond-generation\u201d algorithms) have been developed in recent years. The ability of these models to predict potent sequences was improved by using thousands of sequences as training sets17,18,19 and by employing more sophisticated machine learning tools. Automated neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM) have been used which permit a broader range of attributes of a given sequence to be considered in the selection analysis routine. It is well established that structure in the mRNA target can have significant effects on the ultimate potency of a site to mediate RNAi knockdown,20,21 and the following examples from the literature further highlight the significant role that mRNA secondary structure can play. A direct correlation was demonstrated between the RNAi knockdown efficiency and the local free energy of the target region of mRNA.22 Similar studies regarding the accessibility of mRNA to guide strand/RISC processing have calculated the probability that the mRNA target is unpaired,23 measured the energy required to disrupt mRNA secondary structure,24 considered multiple secondary structures for both mRNA and siRNAs as a partition function calculation25 and have shown that the local structure of the target region is an important predictor of siRNA functionality.26 These studies established methods to incorporate calculations of mRNA and siRNA structural features into site selection algorithms which improve their predictive ability over calculations that only consider the siRNA sequence. Recent publications provide a more detailed discussion of this topic.27,28,29,30 The noted reviews, and others not cited, provide tables referencing publicly available training sets of siRNA knockdown data as well as online tools which can be useful for siRNA design.",

For siRNAs, the mechanism of cleavage proceeds by transesterification, so most chemical modifications which replace the hydroxyl at the 2\u2032-position provide some protection from degradation in a position-specific manner. Likewise, backbone modifications also make RNA a less labile substrate for nucleases. Many of these backbone modifications and 2\u2032-ribose modifications not only increase nuclease stability but also confer increased binding affinity or duplex stabilization.34 Modifications at the 2\u2032-position have been most extensively studied and DNA, 2\u2032-O-methyl RNA (2\u2032OMe), 2\u2032-O-methoxyethyl (2\u2032MOE), locked nucleic acids (LNA), 2\u2032-fluoro (2\u2032F), 2\u2032-fluoro-\u03b2--arabinonucleotide (FANA), and other modifications have been used as RNA replacements with varying levels of success. The extent of chemical modification needed varies with use. For example, methods that employ in vivo administration of naked siRNAs may require greater stabilization than siRNAs injected as a complex with a polymeric delivery vehicle, which itself provides physical protection to the RNA cargo, particularly when extracellular.",

In fact, use of 2\u2032OMe modification generally reduces the toxicity of synthetic dsRNAs when introduced into mammalian cells. Hoerter and Walter demonstrated that a 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease played a significant role in guide strand degradation.35 The same thermodynamic asymmetry of siRNAs which drives guide strand incorporation into RISC (lower thermodynamic stability at the 5\u2032-end of the guide strand) renders this region more susceptible to 5\u2032-exonuclease activity because of the decreased double-stranded nature of the duplex. The guide (antisense) strand was completely degraded after only 3 hours in 3% human serum; whereas, the passenger (sense) strand, with a thermodynamically stabilized 5\u2032-end, showed 50% retention of the full-length strand for the duration of the assay. Modification with 2\u2032OMe residues at the 5\u2032-end of the guide strand and full passenger strand modification36 can prevent siRNA degradation for 6 hours and significantly limits the effects of nuclease attack over 48 hours in 10% serum, yet retains potency. Choung and colleagues also showed that using 2\u2032OMe modifications in a simple alternating pattern in both strands extends stability in 10% human serum to 24 hours. Similarly, Kraynack and Baker demonstrated that fully 2\u2032OMe-modified passenger strands were tolerated and led to Ago2-dependent RISC activity with retained potency.37 In addition to a 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease activity, an RNase A-like endonuclease activity in serum may significantly contribute to siRNA degradation and turnover38,39 and inhibitors of RNase A improve siRNA function and half-life.40 At least in single-stranded form, the 2\u2032OMe modification confers significant stability from endonuclease attack but provides less protection from exonuclease degradation,41 suggesting that other modifications that impart greater nuclease resistance may have a particularly significant role near sequence termini. Not surprisingly, sequence of the siRNA directly affects nuclease stability in the absence of chemical modification42 and some unmodified sequences may have sufficient inherent stability to use in vivo.43",

Interestingly, one study demonstrated that a fully 2\u2032F-modified siRNA was nearly as potent as the unmodified siRNA in reducing green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression, yet was capable of surviving an 18-hour incubation with a RNase that completely degraded an unmodified siRNA.45 Nevertheless, 2\u2032F is usually used in combination with 2\u2032OMe modification. The 2\u2032-FANA modification is similar to 2\u2032F; however, in FANA the 2\u2032-fluorine orientation is equatorial, or in the \u03b2-position. Unlike most other modifications discussed to this point, only a small number of 2\u2032-FANA-modified siRNAs have been studied to date. This modification was demonstrated to improve luciferase knockdown up to fourfold as measured by reduced luciferase activity and mRNA levels. In addition, stability of a 2\u2032FANA-modified siRNA in 10% fetal calf serum was extended from <15 minutes (unmodified siRNA) to about 6 hours.46",

Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that are heavily modified with LNA bases and phosphorothioate (PS) internucleoside linkages can cause significant hepatotoxicity in mice.49 Similar reports have not appeared for LNA-modified siRNAs, possibly because of an inherent lower toxicity of this type of compound (dsRNA with phosphodiester linkages) or use of a reduced number of modified residues.",

The first generation of chemically synthesized artificial siRNAs mimicked the natural product but replaced the 2-nt 3\u2032-RNA overhangs with DNA, typically using a \u201cTT\u201d dimer.6 It soon became clear that use of DNA bases in the overhangs slightly reduced potency compared with the natural RNA design and offered no real advantages.66,67,68 Furthermore, a recent report demonstrated that dT overhangs in siRNAs can inhibit thymidylate synthase, an important enzyme for cell growth and metabolism, leading to unwanted OTEs.69 It is therefore preferred to employ target sequence-matched RNA or RNA derivatives in the overhang, at least on the guide strand. Asymmetric designs, where a single 3\u2032-overhang is positioned on the guide strand, appear to bias loading of that strand (which is desirable) and can offer further increases in potency.70 An asymmetric 21/23-nt duplex of this design was employed to suppress APOB expression in nonhuman primates.64",

It was proposed in 2005 that invoking the natural RISC loading pathway by using synthetic Dicer-substrates as triggers of RNAi might show improved potency or different properties than are seen using synthetic Dicer products. Small synthetic dsRNAs in the 25\u201330-nt size range were tested for the ability to function as siRNAs, and it was found that, for some sites, these longer duplexes were indeed more potent than the cognate 21-nt siRNAs.84 However, at other sites, the two designs were equipotent or the 21-nt siRNAs were more potent. The original compounds tested were blunt, unmodified RNA duplexes which were processed by Dicer into multiple 21-nt siRNAs. The dominant 21-nt species varied with sequence context in an unpredictable way. Use of asymmetric RNA duplexes having a 25-nt passenger strand and a 27-nt guide strand with a single 2-nt 3\u2032-overhang on the guide strand showed much more predictable dicing patterns. Substitution of two DNA bases at the 3\u2032-end of the passenger strand (at the blunt end) further improved reliability of Dicer cleavage, and this new design was proposed for general use as a Dicer-substrate siRNA (DsiRNA).85 It was observed that the duplex orientation during dicing of these compounds influenced strand loading in RISC. Dicer has now been shown to directly participate in strand selection and the positioning of the siRNA within the Dicer complex and is pivotal in determining which strand remains with Ago2 in RISC.86 Like 21-nt siRNAs, 27-nt DsiRNAs can be modified with 2\u2032OMe or 2\u2032F substitutions and show improved properties, such as increased nuclease stability and reduced immune activation, so long as the appropriate domain remains unmodified as a site for Dicer cleavage to occur.65,87,88,89 Increasing the length of synthetic shRNAs may also improve potency;90 however, these long, structured RNAs are difficult to manufacture. Conversely, it was shown that synthetic hairpins which are shorter than 21-nt in length may also have improved function,91,92 and these compounds present no barriers for synthesis.",

While homology searches remain a necessary step to eliminate overt crossreactivity, screens of this stringency are inadequate to predict the actual risk of OTEs. Birmingham and colleagues demonstrated that high complementarity throughout the entire 21-nt guide strand is not required and that significant OTEs can be mediated by as little as the 7-nt domain that comprises the guide \u201cseed region\u201d\u2014nucleotides 2\u20138 at the 5\u2032-end of the guide strand.99,103 Seven base sequence motifs are abundant in the transcriptome, and the number of mRNAs that contain potential seed-region binding sites for a given siRNA usually number in the thousands. Importantly, the presence of a \u201cseed match\u201d in the 3\u2032-UTR of an mRNA does not necessarily correlate with the capability to be regulated by miRNA-like interactions with siRNAs; in fact, most sequence matches of this kind show no effect at all and predicting which sites are \u201creal\u201d versus which sites are short regions of homology of no consequence is difficult, making screening and prediction of OTEs difficult. Heptamer motifs are not uniformly expressed in the 3\u2032-UTRs of mammalian genes and a correlation does exist between the frequency of expression of a motif and the relative risk that sequence bears as a trigger for OTEs.104",

Certain LNA modification patterns were capable of reducing the OTEs without reducing potency. Both LNA and 2\u2032OMe modifications are stabilizing, i.e., they increase the Tm of the siRNA duplex. More recently, Bramsen and colleagues demonstrated that placing a single UNA residue in the seed region (at position 7 from the 5\u2032-end of the guide strand) was particularly effective in decreasing OTEs.57 Incorporation of a UNA modification at position 7 was the most effective variant found for reducing OTEs compared to 10 other chemical modifications tested at various positions within a set of siRNAs specific for three different targets. The beneficial effects of a UNA base at position 7 of the guide strand were independently verified by Vaish and colleagues who additionally found that adding UNA residues at the 3\u2032-ends of both strands increased stability of the siRNA (presumably by reducing 3\u2032-exonuclease attack). Placing a UNA residue at the 5\u2032-end of the passenger strand blocked its ability to participate in RISC and thereby eliminated any OTEs originating from that strand.107 As a general rule, modifications that eliminate the passenger strand from being functional in RISC will prevent OTEs that may arise from that strand and may also improve potency of the guide strand by reducing competition for RISC loading.",

The adaptive immune system employs receptor systems which have hundreds to thousands of gene elements that recombine and mutate to evolve antibody and T-cell responses having exquisite specificity. Adaptive immunity can take months to mount a maximal response. In contrast, the innate immune system relies on a small number of fixed receptors that identify and respond to the presence of known, potentially foreign molecules which are \u201chigh risk\u201d for the host. Innate immunity is rapid but can only respond to a limited collection of predefined triggers. A subset of innate immune receptors recognize foreign DNA [Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), recognizes DNA with unmethylated CpG motifs] and foreign RNA (TLRs 3, 7, and 8, MDA5, RIG-I, PKR, OAS, and others), and it is important to understand the basis of these immune responses and have strategies to evade them when employing synthetic nucleic acids in any mammalian system. Many of these receptors can bind and respond to highly structured self RNAs and a mixture of endogenous chemical modification strategies and compartmentalization help restrict these responses (albeit not always successfully). It is critical to consider the potential for immune responses when designing and interpreting siRNA experiments, and it appears that some early siRNA successes, particularly in treating viral infections, may have had a large unrecognized immune component.112 While one typically considers an innate immune response to a synthetic nucleic acid to be an undesired OTE, there are circumstances where immune stimulation may be beneficial and could be exploited therapeutically.113,114 A number of excellent reviews of this important subject have been published and readers are referred to recent work from Judge and MacLachlan,115 Robbins et al.,116 Krieg,117 and Hennessy et al.118 In spite of the existence of many publications that demonstrate the importance of immune effects, a surprisingly large percentage of in vivo studies seem to ignore this problem (including many of the manuscripts discussed in the present review) and readers are advised to consider this when evaluating all in vivo RNAi work.",

Due to their primary localization in the endosomal compartment, these receptors most readily recognize and bind ligands during internalization of siRNAs complexed with cationic lipids and polymers. Other modes of delivery such as electroporation, hydrodynamic delivery, or peptide transduction can bypass transit through this compartment and often evade detection by these receptors.119 Likewise, shRNAs endogenously synthesized within the cell from a viral template are less likely to trigger an interferon response than when the same sequences are chemically synthesized and exogenously transfected with lipid-based reagents.120 Several cytoplasmic localized receptors recognize foreign RNAs, including PKR, OAS, MDA5, and RIG-I. Fortunately these receptors primarily recognize dsRNAs which are longer than traditional siRNAs (PKR >30, OAS >60\u201370)121,122 or have different end structures than standard siRNAs.

Long dsRNAs naturally exist within mammalian cells and these usually do not elicit an immune response; this is achieved by compartmentalization (exclusion of these RNAs from endosomal TLRs) and endogenous chemical modification. Sugar modifications, such as 2\u2032OMe RNA, and some base modifications, such as pseudouridine, are common in mammalian tRNAs and rRNAs and help these large, highly structured species to evade initiating an autoimmune response. In contrast, foreign RNAs (such as viral RNAs or exogenous synthetic species), which do not bear such modifications, typically trigger immune responses.127 Of the various chemical modifications that can be employed to help synthetic siRNAs evade immune detection, 2\u2032OMe RNA is the most commonly used. It is a naturally occurring RNA variant that is relatively inexpensive and also improves nuclease stability. Extensive modification is not necessary and fewer than 20% of residues can be modified and still block immune responses.128 Furthermore, 2\u2032OMe-modified siRNAs function as competitive antagonists of TLR7 that can act in cis or in trans and retain inhibitory efficacy when dosed as either single- or dsRNAs.129 In fact, 2\u2032OMe-modified siRNAs can block TLR7 activation induced by the small molecule agonist loxoribine. Other 2\u2032-modifications, such as 2\u2032F and LNA, also help to evade immune detection.",

Studies done in vitro that employ cell lines such as HeLa or HEK293, which do not express TLR7 or 8, do not support conclusions that the compounds under investigation do not have immunostimulatory potential. Ideally, in vitro studies should be performed using a mixed population of primary immune cells, such as fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Most importantly, signs of immune activation should be tested in vivo. It is important to look for immune activation at 4 and 24 hours postadministration to catch both the early and late phase responses. Studies that only examine cytokine levels or look for activation of inflammatory pathway genes at 24 hours can easily miss important signs of immune stimulation.",

The challenges to systemic use of siRNAs in animals are well-known: nuclease instability, poor bioavailability, and lack of tissue-targeting. The issues associated with pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) cumulatively represent the most significant hurdle to therapeutic application of this technology. siRNA sequences that mediate potent knockdown for any gene of interest can readily be obtained today. For this reason, there is an emphasis on developing suitable delivery vehicles to make functional siRNAs available in the desired tissue. Many in vivo siRNA studies have been done without any therapeutic target with the objective of characterizing the capabilities of various delivery systems and studying PK/PD. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are imaging technologies that have been applied to define the PK and biodistribution of siRNA nanoplexes. Use of whole-animal imaging modalities is beneficial because measurements do not require animal sacrifice to harvest tissue for a biochemical assay. Rather, these assay methods allow for facile, rapid, quantitative, and serial data collection from the same cohort of animals over an extended time course.",

The two formulations showed different distribution patterns at 2 hours following i.v. administration at which time the PEI-complexed siRNAs showed significantly greater accumulation in the stomach compared to the free siRNAs.

As opposed to the PK of a siRNA nanoplex that can be measured by PET, BLI provides a reliable assay system for quantifying the functionality of siRNAs in vivo\u2014or for assessing the PD. Work from the Davis lab in 2007 combined both imaging modalities to characterize the PK and PD of siRNA delivery.136 They employed PET to track the biodistribution of 64Cu-labeled siRNAs delivered by i.v. administration complexed with a cyclodextrin-based nanoparticle. siRNAs were shown to rapidly accumulate in the kidneys and subsequently in the bladder for excretion. This was true for both transferrin (Tf)-targeted polyplexes and those that did not contain a targeting ligand. Tumor localization as measured by PET for targeted versus nontargeted polyplexes was also quite similar. BLI was used to quantify luciferase knockdown in a constitutively expressing murine tumor model. The functionality of the Tf-targeted siRNAs was improved by >50% compared to nontargeted formulations, suggesting that the Tf-targeting ligand enabled receptor-mediated endocytosis and promoted internalization necessary for siRNA function. Further work by Bartlett and Davis compared the PD of chemically modified (siSTABLE siRNA) and unmodified siRNAs.137 Following hydrodynamic tail vein administration in mice, improved knockdown of luciferase activity in the liver was seen using the modified duplexes. Mathematical modeling of the data suggested that the main advantage of using modified siRNAs occurs before and during uptake into cells. Once the siRNAs were intracellular, kinetics were not predicted to be significantly affected by chemical modification.",

Suppression of TetR removes this block, allowing expression, which in this case was either a \u03b2-galactosidase or luciferase gene. Potent siRNAs have been validated against tetR and successful delivery of these duplexes into cells bearing the tetR-reporter transgene results in the appearance of a detectable signal from the reporter. The positive-readout reporter system was used to test the efficiency of siRNA delivery by several common lipid and polymeric systems. Interestingly, upon testing 16 combinations of delivery systems by 3 routes of delivery, only 1,2-dioleoyl-3-(dimethylamino) propane (DODAP)-based liposomes and stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALPs) gave a positive readout with an i.v. dose (2.5 mg/kg dosed twice) targeting a liver tumor. This novel reporter system greatly reduces background signal, and ubiquitous expression of TetR and the reporter gene allows the PD to be assayed in a tissue-specific manner.",

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is a sensitive and robust method to quantify mRNA in harvested tissue to assess the PD of a siRNA polyplex. Since mRNA is the endogenous biomolecule targeted by siRNAs, this assay is not only relevant to proof-of-principle delivery experiments; determining mRNA levels is a much more direct measurement of siRNA function than phenotypic readouts usually employed in mouse models for a particular disease state. However, a recent manuscript identified a potential artifact encountered when using RT-qPCR on in vivo samples.146 When high doses of siRNAs were given locally to a tissue, the siRNA guide strand was retained in the isolated cellular RNA. If the qPCR assay primers flanked the siRNA target site, the retained 2\u2032OMe-modified guide strand inhibited the reverse transcription (RT) reaction and to a lesser extent qPCR, resulting in a false positive result (i.e., incorrectly observing reduced levels of the target gene of interest).",

The 5\u2032RACE protocol places an oligonucleotide linker at the newly formed 5\u2032-end of an mRNA following Ago2 cleavage. When mediated by RISC, cleavage occurs precisely 10 bases from the 5\u2032-end of the siRNA guide strand. The linker provides a forward PCR primer binding site and PCR is done using a gene-specific reverse primer located 3\u2032-to the cut site. Demonstrating the existence of a cleavage product at this precise location is diagnostic that mRNA cleavage occurred via an RNAi mechanism of action. Note, however, that showing a positive 5\u2032-RACE result does not exclude the possibility that coexisting immune or other OTEs may still contribute to any observed phenotype. Judge and colleagues used 5\u2032RACE-PCR to demonstrate cleavage of the PLK1 target in regressing tumors in mice treated with an anti-PLK1 siRNA delivered in SNALPs.148 Using RNA isolated from the treated tumor cells, RT was performed using gene-specific primers followed by PCR, which resulted in an amplicon of the expected size. Sequencing of this amplicon confirmed the position of the cleavage site. This cleaved sequence was found in tumors of all mice treated with the anti-PLK1 siRNAs and was not found in mice treated with nontargeting, control siRNAs. 5\u2032RACE-PCR has been employed by many investigators as part of their evaluation of siRNA experiments performed in vivo and is the \u201cgold standard\u201d to identify RNAi mechanism of action.64,148,149,150,151,152",

Treatment reduced growth and induced apoptosis in xenogeneic human Hep3B tumor cells implanted in the livers of nude mice or syngeneic Neuro2A tumor cells implanted in the livers of immune-competent A/J mice.148 Evaluation of serum cytokine levels confirmed the absence of an immune response against the 2\u2032OMe-modified siRNAs in SNALPs. Target-specific cleavage of PLK1 and KIF11 mRNA was demonstrated using 5\u2032 RACE-PCR, confirming an RNAi mechanism of action. A separate oncology study involving another cell-cycle protein, COPS5 (CSN5), further demonstrated the effectiveness of SNALPs for systemically delivered siRNAs.164 In an orthotopic tumor model of hepatocellular carcinoma generated with human Huh7-luc+ cells, four doses (2 mg/kg/dose) of SNALP-formulated siRNA targeting COPS5 were given i.v. over the course of 12 days. BLI was used to monitor tumor growth, and the luciferase signal obtained was 50-fold lower in mice receiving the anti-COPS5 siRNA compared with the cohort that received negative control siRNA targeting \u03b2-galactosidase.",

The siRNAs were condensed with protamine and complexed with a shell made of neutral lipids with hyaluronan attached via dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE). Targeting was provided by covalent attachment of FIB504, a monoclonal antibody specific for the \u03b27-integrins, which are cell surface markers expressed on mononuclear leukocytes. The final particles, which were called \u03b27I-tsNPs, each carried ~4,000 siRNA molecules as cargo, equating to ~100 siRNAs per attached surface antibody molecule. The \u03b27I-tsNPs were loaded with control siRNA or siRNA targeting cyclin D1 (Ccnd1), an important cell cycle regulator. CCND1 is essential for cell division, so leukocytes receiving the anti-Ccnd1 siRNA via \u03b27I-tsNPs should show impaired proliferation, thereby limiting their potential to mount an immune response. This system was used to treat a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease, dextran sulfate-induced colitis (DSS-colitis). The anti-Ccnd1 and control \u03b27I-tsNPs were administered i.v. at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg every other day for a total of four doses. Treatment reduced levels of expression of mRNA encoding the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL12 in the gut, but not the immunosuppressive cytokine IL10.

In spite of extensive prior testing of these formulations in rodents and nonhuman primates with little evidence for immunostimulatory potential, one of two patients receiving the highest dose developed flu-like symptoms that indicated development of a significant innate immune response. The trial was stopped and will resume pending reformulation of both the SNALP carrier and siRNA cargo to limit the likelihood of recurrence of immune-related side effects.

A 29- amino-acid peptide derived from the rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) was fused with a poly-arginine cationic domain (9R) and electrostatically complexed with a siRNA cargo.194 The RVG specifically binds the nicotinic acetocholine receptor and siRNAs complexed with this vehicle were shown to be delivered into neuronal cells. Functional performance was validated by using i.v. administration of anti-JEV siRNA complexed with RVG-9R to protect mice from encephalitis caused by infection with the JEV flavivirus. This same strategy was later employed to deliver anti-Tnf siRNA to the CNS, specifically targeting microglia/macrophage cells which also express the nicotinic acetocholine receptor.195 i.v. administration of the anti-Tnf RVG-9R complex was protective against neuronal inflammation following administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Although it was published 4 years ago, independent validation of this potentially exciting approach has not appeared from other groups. The use of synthetic peptides to facilitate transit of the BBB of either small or large molecule drugs following i.v. administration remains an intense area of investigation. Angiochem is developing a suite of engineered peptides that bind the LDL receptor-related protein-1, which is highly expressed throughout the CNS and directs transport of over 40 natural ligands across the BBB. The properties of one peptide, Angiopep-2, was studied in detail and properties appeared to be favorable for development of a CNS-drug delivery aid.196",

A variety of different ligands or functional groups have been covalently attached to siRNAs to direct delivery, usually in a tissue-specific fashion. For this approach, the siRNAs must be chemically modified to confer sufficient nuclease resistance to survive naked exposure to serum or other environments. Aptamers are highly folded single-stranded nucleic acid molecules having conformations that bind a target molecule with high affinity and specificity in a fashion similar to antibodies. Aptamers have been employed to facilitate delivery of siRNAs both in vitro and in vivo. Rossi and colleagues described development of an aptamer specific for the HIV-1 gp120 protein which is expressed on the surface of HIV-infected cells.199,200 An anti-gp120 aptamer was fused with a 27-nt DsiRNA specific for the HIV tat/rev gene. The aptamer-siRNA chimera was made using in vitro transcription with modified bases so that the entire strand was made of RNA purine and 2\u2032F pyrimidine bases. An unmodified RNA complement was hybridized to the siRNA-component of this fusion construct to constitute a functional siRNA duplex. The final compound had good relative nuclease stability and could survive naked incubation in serum. Following uptake into infected cells, the siRNA was cleaved from the aptamer by Dicer, resulting in a 21-nt mature anti-tat/rev siRNA which suppressed HIV mRNA. RNAi mechanism of action was demonstrated by 5\u2032RACE-PCR. Studies were performed using the gp120-DsiRNA fusion molecule with i.v. administration in a humanized mouse model of HIV infection. Although the anti-gp120 aptamer alone had some anti-HIV activity, the gp120-DsiRNA fusion product showed the greatest efficacy and reduced HIV viral titers by several logs, preventing the decline of CD4+ T-cells which is characteristic of advancing HIV infection.152 The antiviral protection extended for several weeks after the last dose.",

Cholesterol was one of the first ligands employed to directly facilitate uptake of siRNAs following i.v. administration. Soutschek and colleagues described direct i.v. injection of an anti-Apob siRNA in mice to lower APOB levels and reduce serum cholesterol.149 The siRNAs employed were modified with 2\u2032OMe RNA and PS linkages. Addition of the cholesterol group extended serum half-life by 15-fold compared with control siRNAs. Uptake was primarily seen in liver and heart, but was also detectable in kidney, adipose tissue, and lung. Although effective, very high doses of siRNAs were needed and administration of 50 mg/kg daily for 3 days was required to achieve a 65% reduction in APOB levels. Similarly, cholesterol has been used to improve uptake of anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs, or \u201cantagomirs\u201d) following i.v. administration.203 Mechanistically, cholesterol-modified siRNAs interact with serum lipoprotein particles and uptake is dependent upon cellular lipoprotein and other transmembrane receptors.204 LDL receptor expression is necessary for uptake of LDL-associated cholesterol-siRNA, which primarily targets liver. In contrast, the scavenger receptor SCARB1 is involved in uptake of HDL-associated siRNAs. Interestingly, the transmembrane protein SID1 is also involved in cholesterol-siRNA uptake; this gene product was originally identified as being essential for siRNA uptake in Caenorhabditis elegans in 2003.205 In addition, Kuwahara and colleagues recently demonstrated a role for APOE and the LDL receptor in the uptake of cholesterol-modified siRNAs by brain capillary endothelial cells following i.v. administration in mice.206",

A dose response study was performed using a vitamin E- modified siRNA targeting murine Apob and reductions in Apob mRNA levels were measured in the liver.

It also reduces Th-1 responses and may blunt the magnitude of local antitumor immune responses. Thus Stat3 silencing could have antitumor effects at several levels. TLR9 recognizes CpG motifs in DNA when the cytosine is not methylated (most mammalian DNAs have 5-methyl-cytosine in the context of a CpG dinucleotide, while bacterial genomes are not modified in this way). TLR9 is expressed on a subset of immune cells including B cells and plasmacytoid DCs. Mice, but not humans, also express TLR9 on monocytes and myeloid DCs. TLR9 is primarily located in the endosomal compartment and cells expressing it will take up CpG-motif DNAs and internalize them even though TLR9 is not present on the cell surface (i.e., TLR9 is not directly involved in internalization). Kortylewski demonstrated that the CpG oligonucleotide plus the linked siRNA cargo was taken up by TLR9-expressing cells and a fraction of this material escaped endosomal sequestration into the cytoplasm and was effective at suppressing STAT3 expression. While most cells will take up DNA whether a CpG motif is present or not, the combination of CpG-motif nucleic acid and TLR9 seemed to improve delivery of the siRNA cargo into the cytoplasm. Direct peritumor injection of the CpG-Stat3-siRNA conjugates reduced the size of s.c. tumor implants. Furthermore, direct i.v. administration of the CpG-Stat3-siRNA conjugates significantly reduced both the size and number of pulmonary implants which developed following i.v. injection of B16 melanoma cells in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice.",

Rather, systemic distribution by i.p. administration is dependent upon indirect distribution initiated by movement of the organism as well as migration via the lymphatic system. i.p. administration is advantageous compared to i.v. delivery in that serum proteins that can contribute to polyplex aggregation are not prevalent. Since i.p.-dosed particles need not extravasate from venous fenestrae in order to reach the targeted tissue of interest, there is less of a requirement that particles have a small diameter (as are needed for i.v. delivery).

This treatment reduced the incidence of metastases and gave no detectable immune response after multiple doses. Ovarian cancer was treated with siRNA against STAT3 or PTK2 (FAK) formulated by reconstituted HDL nanoparticles.197 As discussed previously, siRNAs (0.2 mg/kg) dosed in combination with chemotherapeutic agents led to a significant decrease in tumor weight and the number of tumor nodules present following i.p. as well as i.v. delivery. Additionally, i.p. delivery showed potential for ovarian cancer treatment using neutral, 1,2-dioleoyl- sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) liposomes containing siRNA targeting EPHA2.218 Liposome-siRNA (150 \u00b5g/kg) was i.p.-dosed in a mouse model of advanced ovarian cancer twice weekly for 3 weeks. Compared with mice receiving paclitaxel and control siRNA-DOPC liposomes, 50\u201380% reduction in tumor growth was observed in mice treated with pacitaxel and anti-EPHA2 siRNA-DOPC liposomes. Halder and colleagues again targeted PTK2 (FAK), a protein known to play a role in ovarian cancer metastasis, with a similar neutral lipid/siRNA formulation and dosing regimen as was used in the EphA2 study.219 The results here were very similar to those observed from the HDL nanoparticle experiments. There was a decrease in tumor growth when mice were dosed with anti-PTK2 siRNA compared to negative controls, and the reduction was even more significant when the RNAi therapy was combined with a known chemotherapeutic agent. Given the propensity for metastasis to spread throughout the peritoneal cavity in advanced ovarian cancer, i.p. methods of treatment (including i.p. chemotherapy) are common medical practice today.",

RNA isolated from tumors showed Parp1 knockdown, but survival was extended only in the BRCA1-deficient tumor model and not in the BRCA1 wild-type model. This confirmed a specific mechanism of lethality requiring a deficiency in both PARP1 and BRCA1 to induce apoptosis. Similarly, PEI-formulated, unmodified siRNA targeting MAD2L1 was dosed i.p.

For example, LaCroix-Fralish and colleagues established a role for the \u03b23 subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase pump (Atp1b3) as a source of inter-strain variability in the early phase of the pain response to formalin (chemical burn).238 The mouse strain A/J exhibits a less pronounced pain response to formalin injections into the foot pad than the mouse strain C57BL/6. Genetic mapping and quantitative trait locus analysis tentatively identified the Atp1b3 gene as being implicated in the differences in pain responses between mouse strains; this gene had heretofore not been considered important in nociception. To test this hypothesis, anti-Atp1b3 DsiRNA was administered into the lumbar spinal cord of mice from both strains by i.t. injection at a dose of 0.5 \u00b5g (~0.025 mg/kg) in the cationic lipid iFECT at 24 hour intervals for a total of 3 injections. Mice were then studied for formalin pain response. Mice receiving vehicle alone or control DsiRNAs injections showed the expected behavioral differences between strains, however mice given anti-Atp1b3 DsiRNA showed identical behavior between strains for the early phase of the pain response. This pattern was identical for two different anti-Atp1b3 DsiRNAs, confirming a role for this gene product in nociception.",

Anti-Nts2 DsiRNA was administered as two i.t. injections between the L5 and L6 vertebrae 24 hours apart at a dose of only 1 \u00b5g (~0.005 mg/kg) in the cationic lipid iFECT. The agonist JMV-431 was given on days 1-4 and rats were tested for thermal nociception. Analgesic responses were totally blocked on days 1 and 2 (following the last DsiRNA injection) and gradually returned to baseline thereafter. Both Nts2 mRNA and protein levels were demonstrated to be significantly reduced in the L5/6 dorsal root ganglia at day 2, consistent with the observed phenotypic responses. Two different anti-Nts2 DsiRNAs were demonstrated to result in the same effects, both in suppressing Nts2 expression and altering nociceptive responses to JMV-431. While the iFECT lipid greatly improved delivery of the DsiRNAs to rat spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia, use of the lipid/siRNA cocktail was limited to acute pain studies as vehicle alone altered animal behavior in attempts to perform similar studies using tonic and chronic pain model systems (Nicolas Beaudet, University of Sherbrooke, personal communication). This problem was solved by shifting to use of the peptide delivery tool Transductin (see discussion below).",

Transdermal delivery of siRNAs has been used to knockdown a variety of disease-related targets in skin. An excellent review of the use of lipid-based agents for topical delivery of nucleic acids was recently published by Geusens.246 Some of the most notable work in this field has come from the Kaspar lab working on treatments for Pachyonychia congenita (PC), a rare skin disorder caused by mutations in one of the many keratin genes which is characterized by thickened nails with painfully disabling palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. Thus far, 55 different mutations associated with PC have been identified, the most common of which affects amino-acid position 171 in the keratin KRT6A gene. For more details, see a recent review of this field by Leachman.247 Early work from the lab indicated that unmodified 21-nt siRNAs may be suitable for naked delivery in skin248 and successful uptake of siRNAs in targeted cells was shown using confocal microscopy.249 Empiric screening of a set of siRNAs that were tiled through the site of the N171K mutation identified a potent allele-specific siRNA sequence which selectively suppressed the mutant form of the KRT6A gene.43 The lead candidate from this work (TD101) was taken into a phase 1 clinical trial (see below), utilizing direct injection of unmodified, naked siRNA in saline into the plantar hyperkeratotic lesions. Results from studies performed in a single patient were reported last year.250 While encouraging (transient improvement was observed at the site of the injection), severe pain associated with direct injection proved limiting to the study. As a result, the group has since shifted to study the use of a transdermal delivery cream (GeneCream, TransDerm) or highly modified \u201cself-delivering\u201d siRNAs which could potentially be applied as a topical formulation for therapeutic applications.251",

            "text": "A high percentage of human cervical cancers are linked to infection by the human papilloma virus (HPV), particularly strains HPV16 and HPV18. The viral E7 gene product directs degradation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb, an endogenous tumor-suppressor) by targeting it for ubiquitination. Reducing pRb levels leads to derepression of certain transcription factors, which in turn leads to cell division. At the same time, the viral E6 gene product blocks the compensatory upregulation of p53 that normally occurs as a regulatory response to uncontrolled cell division. Thus the combined actions of the viral E6 and E7 gene products are needed to produce the malignant phenotype. The E6 and E7 genes are therefore ideal targets for nucleic acid-based therapies for the treatment of HPV-derived tumors.263 Direct intratumoral injection of naked, highly modified (siSTABLE) siRNAs targeting the HPV E6/E7 genes was studied by Jonson and colleagues.264 s.c. tumor implants of ovarian cancer cells in mice (CaSki cells, which are HPV 16+) were treated every 3 days (4 pmole/dose in saline, ~0.0025 mg/kg/dose) for 35 days. The size of anti-E6/E7 siRNA-treated tumors was significantly smaller than the saline-treated or the control siRNA-treated implants. Yamato and colleagues took a similar approach, studying the use of carefully optimized unmodified 21-nt anti-E6/E7 siRNAs directly injected into s.c. tumors in mice derived from SiHa cells (a HPV16+ cervical cancer line).265 In this case, the siRNAs were complexed with atelocollagen and dosed at 500 pmoles per injection once every 7 days for 35 days. Dramatic regression of tumors was observed only in the anti- E6/E7 siRNA-treated animals. A number of researchers have employed nucleic acid-based anti-HPV treatments for the treatment of cervical cancer, including expressed anti-E6/E7 shRNAs delivered in a lentiviral vector266 and anti-E6/E7 siRNAs delivered i.v. using a lipid-based nanoparticle.267",

ALN-RSV01 is an unmodified 21-nt siRNA from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals which is currently under study for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) via intranasal/inhaled administration. ALN-RSV01 is administered without a delivery aid; disruption of the integrity of the normal air/tissue interface mucus barrier during viral infection may facilitate delivery in lung, a tissue that is normally well defended against the entry of foreign material. A phase I dose-escalation and tolerability study was completed in 2007.279 A total of 101 healthy adults were treated with placebo (normal saline) or ALN-RSV01 and no adverse effects were observed for doses of up to 150 mg administered five times daily. Any side effects seen were moderate and occurred with similar frequency in the ANL-RSV01 treatment group and the placebo group. A Phase 2 study evaluated ALN-RSV01 in 88 healthy human volunteers inoculated with RSV.280 ALN-RSV01 was delivered intranasally (75 or 150 mg) 2 days prior to and 3 days following RSV infection. The placebo-treated group showed 71.4% RSV infections; whereas, the ALN-RSV01 recipients had only 44.2% culture-defined RSV infections. Further evaluation of ALN-RSV01 in naturally infected patients was recently completed in 24 lung-transplant patients infected with RSV.281 Three daily treatments with aerosolized ALN-RSV01 (0.6 mg/kg) resulted in an improvement of RSV symptoms as reflected by \u201ccumulative daily total symptom scores.\u201d In addition, ALN-RSV01 treatments lead to a reduction in the incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans (BOS)\u2014fibrosis/inflammation of the bronchioles following RSV infection. A further Phase IIb clinical trial was opened in February of 2010 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aerosolized ALN-RSV01 as well as standard of care in lung-transplant patients infected with RSV (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01065935). The primary outcome measure of this study which is currently recruiting patients will be the occurrence of new or progressive BOS.",

Large sets of siRNAs targeting a particular gene can be made using PCR, in vitro transcription, and Dicer. A pooled collection of anti-Vegf diced-siRNAs (1 \u00b5g) were formulated in Lipofectamine and administered by subconjunctival injection in rats in a suture-induced corneal angiogenesis model system.284 Treatment with the pooled anti-Vegf siRNAs significantly reduced angiogenesis. Any therapy which reduces neovascularization is of interest in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or diabetic retinopathy. In another study using lipid-assisted delivery, fluorescently labeled siRNAs were formulated in Transit-TKO and administered by direct intravitreal injection in mice.285 As little as 5 ng of siRNAs showed robust uptake in the retina by histological sectioning and fluorescent microscopy 24 hours following injection.",

Most compounds suitable for oral administration are small molecule drugs formulated to release the active agent in the stomach or small intestine for absorption by the gut mucosa and eventual release into the circulatory system. This environment is quite harsh, and any drug delivered this way experiences wide swings in pH with prolonged exposure to a variety of nucleases, as well as proteases and lipases. While oral administration of siRNAs remains a lofty goal, it seems unlikely that true systemic delivery will be easily achieved, although Tillman and colleagues have reported some success with oral delivery of single-stranded ASOs.290 Double-stranded siRNAs have a very high molecular weight and, even if such compounds survived the harsh gastrointestinal environment, they would be largely excluded from uptake by the gut epithelia and subsequent escape into the circulatory system. Therefore, this discussion of a common route of systemic delivery for small molecules is more appropriately highlighted under the heading of \u201clocal delivery\u201d since oral administration of siRNAs may more easily find application to treat local diseases within the gastrointestinal system itself. Wilson and colleagues designed a thioketal delivery system that is selectively degraded in the presence of reactive oxygen species produced in the intestinal epithelium.291 In this case, the orally-delivered siRNA targets Tnf, a proinflammatory cytokine which induces the intestinal inflammation required to release the siRNA from the thioketal delivery system. Colitis-induced mice were dosed by oral gavage with 0.23 or 2.3 mg/kg of siRNAs daily for 6 days and sacrificed on the 7th day to determine siRNA uptake and function in target tissue. The induced colon inflammation coupled with thioketal-formulated particles led to increased release of Cy5-labeled siRNAs selectively in regions of inflammation. Also, colonic Tnf levels were significantly reduced based on RT-qPCR analysis of mRNA in harvested tissue. In addition to the thioketal work, the same group also developed a PEI-condensed siRNA and PLGA nanoparticle delivery system for reducing TNF in inflamed colon tissue.292 Anti-Tnf-siRNA nanoparticles showed a tenfold decrease in colonic TNF expression when dosed orally over the course of 4 days compared to control siRNAs.",

Akita and colleagues coupled the fusogenic peptide GALA to this particle and employed it for ex vivo delivery of siRNA targeting Socs1 to bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs).298\nEx vivo silencing of Socs1 led to an increase in STAT1 production in BMDCs as confirmed by Western blot. Likewise, the cytokines TNF and IL6 were both increased in the anti-Socs1-treated BMDCs compared to use of a control siRNA.

The past five years have seen an explosion in the use of siRNAs as a research tool in animal models. While such experiments are not yet routine, the use of gene knockdown technology in vivo has almost become expected in some journals. The technology exists to suppress the level of any gene target desired. Delivery technology has not fully caught up, and safe, efficient delivery of the nucleic acid effector molecules to the desired tissue remains the greatest limitation to more widespread adoption of this technology.",

Over time, the underlying mechanisms for these unwanted OTEs have been elucidated and methods to prevent or circumvent them are now widely available. In particular, selective use of chemical modifications (such as 2\u2032OMe and UNA residues) can reduce or eliminate many of the miRNA-pathway class of OTEs and can help to evade stimulation of the innate immune system. While many cell lines adapted to growth in vitro no longer have the capacity to respond to dsRNAs as foreign molecules, stimulation of the innate immune system is a significant concern in vivo and it is prudent to modify all siRNAs used in animal work, especially when using polymer- and lipid-based delivery tools that maximize exposure of the siRNA cargo to the endosomal compartments where TLRs 7 and 8 reside. All in vivo studies should include monitoring for immune stimulation by the siRNAs and/or the delivery tool, even if the appropriate chemical modification strategies are employed.",

New delivery tools are constantly under development that hopefully will address these concerns, and breakthroughs in delivery technology will pave the way to finally make animal experimentation commonplace. The \u201cfinal frontier\u201d of siRNA technology is use as a drug in humans. A number of clinical trials are already in progress and additional new trials are planned to begin in the next few years. Local administration avoids many of the complications seen with systemic delivery; therefore ocular and topical therapies have the greatest potential to move forward quickly. Recent advances in lipid nanoparticle chemistry look particularly favorable for liver delivery, and it seems likely that hepatic diseases may be the first area widely approachable using systemic/i.v. routes of administration. As a final note: as with all branches of science, novel methods in the RNAi field are quickly published and rapidly generate widespread enthusiasm; it is prudent to recall that many of the exciting reports discussed herein have not yet been reproduced by outside groups and that independent validation is a necessary step.",
