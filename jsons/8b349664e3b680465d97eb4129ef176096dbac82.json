Therefore, with arrival of COVID-19 in Salzburg/ Austria in mid March 2020, we established a specialized \"COVID Surgery Service (CSS)\", exclusively dealing with the COVID patients, and a \"split team structure\" (2 teams of specialists with complementing expertise) for the Non-COVID cases. This structure was designed under the assumption that alternating teams would remain capable of handling in case of necessary temporary quarantine of one team.",

The emergency surgeries are performed upon our exclusive triage system demonstrated in Figure 1. If there is a possibility to postpone surgery, it was suggested to wait for the result of COVID testing. With a negative test result, the patient is transferred to the Non-COVID service, with a positive test, the surgery take place in the COVID clinic under the above-mentioned conditions. The decision regarding the type of surgery (open vs minimally invasive surgery) in the COVID-clinic is based on the same internationally accepted standards as in the Non-COVID-setting. All facilities for performing minimally-invasive surgeries are made available at our COVID-clinic. It is unclear if a laparoscopic procedure increases the risk for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Accumulation of smoke within the pneumoperitoneum may occur during monopolar dissection. This accumulated smoke may be expulsioned during the deflation of the pneumoperitoneum for any reason or in case of \"trocar leakage\". For this reason, a filtration system (active or passive) (e.g. AirSeal\u00a9 CO 2 pressure insufflator (Surgiquest Inc., Milford, USA)) with filters (HEPA or ULPA) is included to the standard OR equipment [6]. This allows for safe evacuation of the pneumoperitoneum when the minimally-invasive procedure is terminated. For open surgery an automatic smoke evacuator is established as standard device for monopolar electrosurgery",
