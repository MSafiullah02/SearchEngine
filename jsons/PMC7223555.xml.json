Current estimates show that immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and measles prevents ~2\u20133 million deaths annually [3]. Yet, there remains much to be done. Infectious diseases are still a leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age, and more than four million infants die before their first birthday each year worldwide; 63% of these deaths occur within the first month of life [4]. Maternal immunization\u2014the practice of vaccinating women during pregnancy\u2014has the potential to significantly reduce neonatal mortality when infants are dependent on maternally transferred antibodies for protection. Recent advances in the field could change the way we protect mothers and their infants and potentially save thousands of lives every year.",

In women, some of this increased vulnerability is due to pregnancy-associated hormones interacting with immune responses [6]; by contrast, in infants, immature immune systems require time and often multiple vaccine doses to mount adequate responses to many infectious diseases [7]. Maternal immunization can address this vulnerability by offering protection to a woman and her young infant by passive infant immunity conferred through the active transfer of antibodies, specifically immunoglobulin G (IgG), from the mother across the placenta [8]. IgG persists through the first few, most vulnerable months of life before degrading to unprotective levels. While some definitions of maternal immunization include protection conferred through breast milk, this discussion will be restricted to vaccines and the subsequent protection through placental transfer of maternal antibodies.",

In pregnant immunocompetent women, many immunologically adaptive processes occur in a synchronized fashion to ensure the mother can tolerate the presence of these paternally derived antigens. Key among these processes is an increased concentration of sex hormones such as estrogen and progesterone, which induce a shift in maternal pro- and anti-inflammatory responses [12] Typically, pro-inflammatory responses are a prominent feature of the first trimester, and anti-inflammatory responses are more prominent in the second and third trimesters [13]. During pregnancy, there is a rise in sex hormone levels, which, in addition to the shift in maternal pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, modulates the balance between type 1 helper (Th1) cells necessary for cell-mediated immunity and type 2 helper (Th2) cells necessary for humoral immunity. Increases in estradiol result in increases in Th2 cells, which then suppress cytotoxic T lymphocytes and stimulate B lymphocytes to increase production of antibodies that are then transferred across the placenta to the fetus [14].",

For example, local immunologic mechanisms mediated at the feto-maternal junction help protect the fetus from rejection, while cytokines provide the required growth factors necessary for fetal implantation in the placenta. Several factors can influence the placenta\u2019s role in immunity [15]. Maternal infection with malaria or HIV, for instance, decreases the placenta\u2019s ability to transport IgG by impairing antibody Fc (crystallizable fragment) receptor function, whereas higher levels of total maternal IgG reduce transfer of antigen-specific IgG by competitively binding to placental Fc receptors [16]. IgG transfer across the placenta also appears to differ by subtype. For example, IgG1, which is induced by protein antigens such as tetanus toxoid, is more efficiently transferred than IgG2, which is induced by lipopolysaccharide antigens such as those in encapsulated bacteria [16].",

Fetal and neonatal T cells display Th2 responses that are ineffective against intracellular pathogens, and antibody responses to bacterial polysaccharides are ineffective [16]. This results in the fetus and young infant relying on supplemental maternal protection provided by the active transport of IgG across the placenta. IgG efficiently crosses the human placenta via syncytiotrophoblast cells that are in contact with maternal blood [16]. Circulating maternally derived IgG is internalized in endosomes and binds to neonatal Fc receptors, which are expressed on the internal endosomal surface. These endosomes fuse with the membrane on the fetal aspect of the syncytiotrophoblast and release IgG, which then passes through villous stroma and fetal capillary endothelium to enter the fetal circulation [16]. There is active transport of IgG during the second and third trimesters, with IgG flux enhanced significantly after 32 weeks of gestation. Some studies report the concentration of fetal IgG in the late second trimester and early third trimester is 25\u201350% lower when compared to term infants [17]. When a fetus reaches full term, its IgG concentrations are sometimes even greater than those in the maternal circulation, because of the active transport mechanism [18]. Multiple factors can affect the transfer, including placental integrity, maternal noninfectious diseases, total maternal IgG concentration, IgG subtype, presence of neonatal Fc receptors, nature of the antigen, and timing of vaccination or infection [8].",

WHO estimates that from 2000 to the end of 2017, there was an 85% decrease in neonatal tetanus deaths. This was due, in large part, to a globally sustained initiative called the Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination initiative, which targeted pregnant women and women of reproductive age with TTCV [22]. Pregnant women and their newborn infants are protected from birth-associated tetanus if the mother received either six TTCV doses during childhood or five doses if first vaccinated during adolescence (documented by card, immunization registry, and/or history), before the time of reproductive age. While complete eradication remains unlikely because of the ubiquitous and highly resistant nature of the causative pathogen, Clostridium tetani, efforts are underway to reduce the global burden of this devastating disease through a four-pronged strategy [23]:Routine vaccination of pregnant women with TTCV.Supplementary immunization activities, such as immunization of all women of childbearing age in areas at highest risk of maternal and neonatal tetanus and school- or community-based immunization.Safe deliveries attended by a skilled birth attendant who uses sterilized equipment/materials and clean cord care practices.Improved neonatal tetanus surveillance and enhanced preventive strategies with vaccination, and improvement of perinatal care and post-exposure prophylaxis in high-risk areas\u2014especially among the most vulnerable populations.",

Maternal immunization should occur in the second or third trimester, or at least 15 days before the end of the pregnancy, though there are national variations to this recommendation [25, 26]. For example, the United States recommends Tdap vaccination during each pregnancy regardless of previous vaccination status, and while 27\u201336 weeks is promoted as the ideal time frame, vaccination can be administered at any time. Argentina, Ireland, and Australia also recommend Tdap vaccination during each pregnancy; however, the time frames vary: Argentina starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy, Ireland at 16\u201336 weeks, and Australia recommending Tdap in the third trimester. In the United Kingdom, reduced diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-inactivated poliomyelitis vaccination is recommended during each pregnancy, ideally between 16 and 32 weeks [13].",

There was a 51% relative reduction in the cohort whose mothers were immunized during pregnancy against pertussis [28].

            "text": "Pregnant women and young children are more vulnerable to severe complications from influenza relative to the general population. Influenza is characterized by the sudden onset of constitutional and upper respiratory symptoms such as fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, non-productive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis. In young children, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may accompany influenza infection. Complications can include dehydration, pneumonia, sinusitis, otitis, encephalitis, or worsening of pre-existing medical issues [31]. Reports have documented an increase in influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths in pregnant women and their newborn infants during seasonal influenza outbreaks or pandemics [13, 32]. Fetuses are not exempt and are more likely to be stillborn, born prematurely, and/or have low birth weight if their mothers were infected with the influenza virus during pregnancy. The 1918 and 2009\u20132010 influenza A/H1N1 pandemics, which were associated with an increase in mortality and morbidity in these two groups, underscore these observations. A growing number of studies have examined the safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness of pandemic influenza vaccines in pregnancy. One study from Norway reported that influenza diagnoses decreased by 70% when 117,000 pregnant women were given adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine [32]. In a Swiss cohort, maternal vaccination given at least 2 weeks before delivery during the 2010\u20132011 influenza season increased antibody titers in cord blood between 6- and 17-fold and provided sero-protection rates between 6- and 34-fold, depending on the strain and interval between vaccination and delivery [33]. In a matched case\u2013control study in an urban hospital in the northeastern United States, influenza vaccine given to pregnant women was 91.5% effective in preventing hospitalizations (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61.7\u201398.1, P = 0.001) for infants aged < 6 months [34]. Another study in three geographically diverse US counties reported the vaccine was 45% to 48% effective in preventing seasonal laboratory-confirmed influenza\u2013related hospitalizations in infants aged < 6 months between 2002 and 2009 (adjusted odds ratio = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.30\u20130.91) [35]. Four randomized controlled trials, conducted in Mali, South Africa, Nepal, and Bangladesh, evaluated the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccine administered during pregnancy [36\u201339]. Efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza in infants born to vaccinated mothers ranged from 30% in Nepal to 63% in Bangladesh. Vaccine efficacy in mothers in Mali was 70.3% (95% CI: 42.2\u201385.8) and 50.4% (95% CI: 14.5\u201371.2) in non-HIV infected mothers in South Africa. Reductions in febrile respiratory illness were also reported in mothers in Bangladesh and Nepal (19% [95% CI: 1\u201334] and 36% [95% CI: 4\u201357], respectively).",

Infant vaccines against RSV have been in development for decades but have faced challenges, including the ability to elicit sufficient immunogenicity and safety concerns regarding an early whole virus vaccine candidate [67\u201370]. These concerns, along with the need to protect infants in early life and maternal immunization\u2019s track record of reducing influenza and pertussis in young infants, has prompted evaluation of maternal RSV vaccine candidates [48].",

Infants born to mothers vaccinated from 28 weeks to <33 weeks of pregnancy showed 53 percent vaccine efficacy rates against hospitalization with RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and 70 percent against severe RSV hypoxemia through their first 90 days. The trial also demonstrated a 25% reduction in all-cause LRTI hospitalizations and a 39% reduction in all-cause LRTI severe hypoxemia in infants observed through the first 180 days of life. A peer-reviewed manuscript is forthcoming. Although additional studies will be needed to meet regulatory and licensure requirements for this vaccine, these results begin to provide data to support proof of concept for maternal RSV vaccines. Three other early clinical-stage RSV F protein maternal vaccine candidates are currently in development, all of which are stabilized pre-fusion F protein vaccine candidates. Developers include Pfizer, New York, NY, USA (NCT03529773); GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK (NCT02753413); and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD, USA (NCT03049488) [73\u201375].",

Vaccinating an at-risk pregnant woman against HEV could protect her and her unborn child. Furthermore, as anti-HEV IgG protects nonhuman primates from high-dose intravenous virus challenge [79], maternal immunization should transfer similarly protective maternal IgG to the fetus, potentially offering additional months of protection postpartum. In a large prospective cohort study of 2404 pregnant women in Nepal, where HEV is hyper-endemic, >60% of subjects were susceptible, as they lacked detectable anti-HEV antibodies (Innis BL, unpublished data).

The majority (95 percent) of neonatal infections result from virus presence in the vagina while ~5% are transplacental. Transmission occasionally occurs via breast milk or contact with infected skin lesions. Primary maternal genital infection during pregnancy confers a 10\u201320 times higher risk compared with recurrent, secondary lesions because of higher viral replication, longer excretion rates from primary lesion and lack of maternal antibodies which can be passed to the infant. Three types of clinical presentations occur: in 20% of patients, a disseminated, systemic infection presents earliest (days 4\u201310 of life); in the most common type of perinatally acquired HSV, a skin, eye, and mucus membrane symptom complex predominate; and in up to 30 percent of cases, infection is localized to the central nervous system as encephalitis [93]. Prompt recognition, antiviral administration, and supportive treatment form the mainstay of therapeutic management [97]. Mortality is worst for disseminated disease, and long-term, neurodevelopmental morbidities worst with CNS disease. Herpes simplex candidate vaccines are being evaluated in clinical trials [98], however, conclusive protective benefit has not been established nor has licensure been granted [99].",

Zika infection in the first trimester results in worse sequelae than infections later in pregnancy [100]. Multiple Zika virus vaccine candidates are currently under investigation, including whole virus inactivated vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines, vectored vaccines, and protein-based and peptide-based candidates [101]. Some of these are currently in phase 1 and 2 trials [102]. An additional area of interest in Zika prophylaxis is the development of \u201ctherapeutic vaccines,\u201d which aim to prevent infection of the fetus in women infected with the Zika virus periconceptually or during pregnancy [103].",

Due to the loss of gastrointestinal fluids and increased vascular permeability, patients may go on to develop shock, ultimately resulting in multiple organ failure and death. Ebola virus disease (EVD) is transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids (blood, urine, semen, saliva, sweat, and breast milk) of infected people or animals. Among pregnant women, case fatality rates in earlier outbreaks have ranged from 89 to 93% with universally (100%) poor perinatal outcomes; the vast majority of pregnancies resulting in spontaneous abortion or stillbirth (78%) and none of the live births (22%) surviving beyond the third week of life [104]. Pregnant women despite having an enhanced risk of morbidity, mortality, and adverse birth outcomes associated with Ebola have been systematically excluded from Ebola vaccine trials and until recently were excluded from immunization, such as during the 2018 outbreak in the Kivu region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which deployed a replicating live virus vaccine, rVSV-ZEBOV-GP [105, 106]. In December 2018, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization called for special consideration of pregnant and lactating women in EVD vaccine research. Three new non-replicating or replication deficient vaccines are currently in advanced stages of clinical evaluation or have been licensed [107]. SAGE provided updated interim recommendations in February 2019, announcing support for inclusion of pregnant women in vaccine trial protocols with the new vaccines [105, 106]. As of October 2019, more than 840 pregnant women have received the vaccine with birth outcomes and safety data under consideration [108]. The rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on 19 December 2019, with guidance that the \u201cdecision to vaccinate a woman who is pregnant should consider the woman\u2019s risk of exposure to Zaire ebolavirus\u201d [109, 110]. In February 2020 as part of \u201cWHO Guidelines for the management of pregnant and breastfeeding women in the context of Ebola virus disease\u201d a recommendation was made for these women to be offered vaccination with the prequalified rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine \u201cduring an active Zaire EBOV outbreak in affected areas, in the context of rigorous research or in accordance with a compassionate use protocol\u201d [111].",

Strategies for delivering maternal vaccines include routine delivery incorporated into existing services (antenatal, primary, and HIV care, and well and sick child visits), vaccination campaigns, and outreach [114]. Effective integration of maternal immunization into routine health care services, such as antenatal care, can provide an opportunity to strengthen and improve the maternal health platform through access to new resources; potentially increase uptake by improving the perception of the quality of care; and increase overall antenatal care attendance while also expanding vaccine delivery systems [115, 116]. A coordinated, integrated delivery effort can ensure a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d where vaccines are available and offered to pregnant women where, when, and by the same provider they attend for pregnancy care. This approach will minimize missed opportunities for vaccination and provide continuity of care [117].

During pregnancy, maternal hypercholesterolemia is associated with markedly increased formation of fatty streaks in fetal arteries and accelerated development of atherosclerosis during normocholesterolemic childhood [125]. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (OxLDL) accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions and are highly immunogenic. Immunizing rabbits and mice with various models of OxLDL is thought to induce antibodies that form complexes with circulating LDL. Immunization may also induce a switch from Th1 cells, which secrete proatherogenic interferon gamma, to Th2 cells that secrete antiatherogenic interleukins [126, 127]. Studies into whether immunizing rabbits and mice with OxLDL before pregnancy protected the fetus from atherogenic in-utero programming showed up to 56% reduced atherosclerosis in adult offspring. These studies also noted that maternal immunization with OxLDL caused a persistent change in specific postnatal B cell and antibody responses\u2014in some cases, independent of transplacental passage of immunoglobulins. They concluded that maternal immunization with selected antigens may open a new preventive approach not solely for atherosclerosis, but for other immune-modulated diseases [128]. Similar conclusions can be made about the positive effects of maternal immunization on in-utero programming and subsequent reduction in offspring of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and adult allergy-related responses [129, 130].",
