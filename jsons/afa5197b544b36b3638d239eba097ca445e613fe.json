If in doubt about confirming cardiac arrest, then start chest compressions until help arrives -only begin to do this if there is no perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. If there is a perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, place a cloth over the patient's mouth and nose prior to starting chest compressions 2. As always, make sure an ambulance is on its way. If the patient is suspected or The Resuscitation Council UK have produced a helpful video that can be found on their website: https://bit.ly/35TITYd. 1 It is important to note that until recently both Resuscitation Council UK and Public Health England (PHE) have had differing opinions on the level of PPE required for chest compressions. This has caused a lot of confusion across the NHS posing the question 'which guidelines are the correct guidelines to follow?' . A recent statement on 24 April aligns PHE guidelines with those of RCUK, 2 allowing Trusts to adopt AGP PPE if they consider it more appropriate. RCUK urge HCPs to relay this information to their trusts to best ensure their safety, as well as that of their colleagues and families. With thanks to Miss McKernon and Mr Thwaini for this update. TED-talk style. The talks covered the latest advancements in research, including 'Caries Diagnosis: Don't believe everything you are told -look at the evidence' , 'Oral cancer: Establishing a global network of innovators' and 'Stem cells in dentistry: How close are we?' . These informative DentTalks were delivered by Professor David Ricketts, Dr Niall Mc Goldrick, and Dr Evgeny Kushnerev, respectively.",
