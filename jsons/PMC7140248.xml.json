P. falciparum is the most aggressive species, producing more severe cases, and cerebral malaria. The clinical presentation occurs after an incubation period of between 7 and 30 days, with infection by P. falciparum being the shortest and P. malariae being the longest. Both P. vivax and P. ovale can present relapses years later, as they produce hypnozoites (schizonts that remain dormant in the hepatocytes and are not susceptible to drugs that eliminate the erythrocytic forms). P. falciparum and P. malariae may lead to recrudescences as parasites remain in the tissues, giving rise to new cycles of elevated parasitaemia. This usually occurs after untreated or poorly treated infections, presenting increasingly milder cases, especially in patients who live in endemic areas and have developed immunity against the infection. Usually the recrudescences occur quite soon after the initial infection, but they have been described up to 10 years later.16\n",

The treatment of malaria should be carried out according to the species and place of travel of the patient, as a way to consider the possible pharmacological resistance. Uncomplicated malaria can be treated orally with drugs if there is no digestive intolerance. Cases of complicated malaria should be treated in ICUs. IV artesunate has been shown to decrease parasitaemia and the length of stay both in the ICU and on the ward more rapidly, and therefore it has become the treatment of choice for the treatment of severe malaria, rather than quinine,18 with little but growing drug-resistance described so far.22 In Table 5\nwe review the treatment of malaria. In case of pregnancy, artesunate is contraindicated in the first trimester, so it should be treated with quinine + clindamycin.",

            "text": "Dengue fever is the main virus that causes these symptoms, and the second most frequent cause of fever in the patient who has returned from the tropics.24 There are 4 serotypes with different antigenic characteristics. Its incidence has increased in the last decades, with WHO estimating an annual incidence of 50 million cases.25 It is considered a global public health problem, with a mortality of 2.5%. The main vectors are principally Aedes aegypti, and to a lesser extent Aedes albopictus. They present an incubation period of 4\u201310 days after the mosquito bite. Dengue and severe dengue are distinguished with or without signs of alarm.26 It initially presents with a high fever (40 \u00b0C) and nonspecific symptoms (severe headache, pain behind the eyes, myalgias, arthralgias, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands). Petechiae and minor haemorrhages may appear. The tourniquet test (Rumpel\u2013Leede sign) can be helpful in the diagnosis. It consists of the application of pressure by a sphygmograph higher than the mean arterial pressure for 5 min, to assess the appearance of petechiae after its withdrawal (being positive if there is more than 20 petechiae in a 5 cm diameter area). This febrile phase lasts between 3 and 7 days, followed by the critical phase, which begins when the temperature begins to normalise, below 37.5 \u00b0C. In these 48\u201372 h, the patients who improve after the fever subsides are considered cases of dengue without warning signs. However, there may be warning signs in relation to increased capillary permeability (severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, oedema, mucosal haemorrhage, lethargy, hepatomegaly), with analytical disorders such as increased haematocrit (due to the extravasation of fluids due to a decrease in protein), together with a rapid fall of platelets. Severe dengue (5%) is diagnosed if there is a significant loss of plasma that leads to haemodynamic shock, pleural effusion, severe haemorrhage or severe organ damage (elevation of transaminases > 1000, neurological or cardiac disorders). In the recovery phase the general condition improves, the gastrointestinal symptoms improve, the haemodynamic state is stabilized and diuresis is increased.",

            "text": "Schistosomiasis affects millions of people, 90% of them in Africa, and produces up to 200,000 deaths per year, according to WHO.58 It is a trematode that lives in fresh water and is released by certain species of snails. While a person is swimming or bathing, the cercariae penetrate the human skin and can pass into the blood stream. In some cases, a localised dermatitis (swimmer's itch) is produced.59 In the blood, they mature and move to the blood vessels (the mesenteric venules and the venous plexus of bladder, respectively), where the adult worms lay eggs. These eggs can be excreted in the faeces or in urine, infesting the waters where the miracidia are released that infect the snails, closing the cycle. Additionally, the eggs provoke an immune reaction in the organism that produces the clinical symptoms of the acute infection. Katayama syndrome or fever at 3\u20138 weeks is typical but not frequent. It presents as a fever, with respiratory symptoms such as cough, and urticaria, and frequently a skin rash and eosinophilia in 50% of cases. There are 5 species of schistosomes: Schistosoma mansoni (more frequent in Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Brazil and Venezuela), S. japonicum (China, Philippines and Indonesia), S. mekongi (Laos and Cambodia) S. intercalatum (Central African jungle areas) which all produce intestinal disease, and Schistosoma haematobium, frequent in Africa and the Middle East, which produces genitourinary disease. The diagnosis is based mainly on the detection of eggs in urine or faeces, although serology with detection of antibodies in blood or urine can be used. The treatment is praziquantel, in a single dose, although it is advisable to repeat the dose 2\u20134 weeks later.",
