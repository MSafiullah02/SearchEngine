Pregnant women with confirmed infection and their fetuses should be closely supervised and monitored to be able to recognise early any clinical deterioration of mother and child. At the moment, it is to be assumed that pregnancy can complicate the clinical course of COVID-19 disease and may be associated with a higher mortality rate, but by far not as bad as with MERS or SARS. Pregnant women are at particular risk of respiratory virus infections, especially influenza. On the other hand, given their age, they usually belong to a patient population with a lower risk of developing severe COVID-19 clinical courses. At the moment there is no indication of intrauterine virus transmission to the fetus, nor for virus transmission via breastfeeding after a cured infection.",
