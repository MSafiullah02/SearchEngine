However, in a previous study from our laboratory [Kaul et al, 1981bl we have reported that cell-free secretory-IgA levels are significantly higher in patients more than 6 months of age than in patients less than 6 months of age at the time of infection with RSV. These differences can be explained on the basis that the technique employed in the present study measures either the presence or absence of cell-bound immunoglobulins on the nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, and cannot measure the level of antibody free in secretions after RSV infection. Based on the present evidence we cannot conclusively say that the immunoglobulins on NPEC are in fact RSV specific. However, immunoglobulin could be detected essentially only on RSV-infected cells, as determined by double-labeling techniques. Immunofluorescence was blocked if slides were preincubated with RSV antigen. Moreover, to our knowledge, Fc receptors on RSV-infected cells have not been described. Based on this evidence we presume that the various immunoglobulin classes detected on NPEC represent RSV-specific antibody.",

These immunoglobulins were presumably directed agains antigens of the virus responsible for the infection. In the small number of samples tested, no cell-bound C'3 could be detected. The absence of C'3 might have been due to obtaining samples very early in the illness before C'3 was fixed, or to the possibility that RSV-infected cells may fix C13 more avidly than cells infected with other viral agents. Finally, a larger number of samples might have revealed the presence of C13 on NPEC from patients with non-RSV infection.",

It has been shown that antihemagglutinin and antineuraminidase antibodies were equally effective in reducing the influenza virus titers in culture fluids. In addition both antisera prevented in vitro spread of the influenza virus. The binding of immunoglobulins to the antigen-bearing cells could play an important role in cytolysis of infected cells and elimination of viral antigen by the mechanism of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Alternatively antigen-antibody complexes could activate complement pathways and lead to cytolysis of the antigen-bearing cells.",

            "text": "Secretory antibody is believed to play a significant role in recovery from RSV infection [Chanock et al, 19701 . However, the development of local antibody in the respiratory tract may not be sufficient condition for neutralization of KSV, since RSV can be isolated from respiratory secretions in the presence of cell-free antibody (McIntosh et al, 19781 . Fixation of complement either by cell-free or cell-bound antibody may be an important factor for neutralization of RSV in the respiratory tract, since addition of complement to in vitro neutralization assays enhances the capacity of the serum antibody to neutralize RSV [Kaul et al, 1981al. Limited histopathological studies have failed to reveal the deposition of complement in the lung parenchyma in RSV infection [Chanock et al, 1970, Gardner et al, 19701 . However, in the present study deposition of complement on nasopharyngeal epithelial cells was demonstrated in about 46% of the samples tested in the first 8 weeks after the onset of RSV illness. Cell-bound C13 was usually present simultaneously with one of the immunoglobulins on NPEC, but in a small percentage (4.6070) of patients cell-bound C/3 was detected in the absence of any cell-bound immunoglobulins. Moreover, in 4.6% of patients, cell-bound C'3 was detected in association with IgA only, an immunoglobulin isotype which does not activate complement components by classical pathways. These findings suggest in vivo activation of the complement cascade either by antigen-antibody complexes or by RSV alone. In vitro studies by Crewal et a1 [ 19801 have shown that infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus-infected tissue culture cells can activate the alternate complement pathway in the absence of any antiviral antibody. In a similar fashion, Sindibis virus grown in tissue culture cells could activate both classical and alternate pathways of complement in a variety of sera [Hirsh et al, 1980al . Activation of complement by the alternate pathway can occur in C4-deficient guinea pig sera by Sendai virus-infected tissue culture cells in the absence of any detectable antiviral antibody [Okada et al, 19791 , In earlier studies by Cooper et a1 [1976] coranaviruses have been shown to activate the classical C' pathway by direct interaction of Clq with cornavirus. The activation of complement in such a system leads to complete lysis of the coronavirus. Similarly, vesicular stomatitis virus can directly attach to Clq in the serum and thus activate the classical complement pathway, which leads to complete neutralization of the virus [Mills and Cooper, 1978. 1.",

Various studies with experimental animals have clearly shown the importance of the complement system for host defense against viral infections. Hicks et a1 [I9781 have shown that mice decomplemented with cobra venom factor had prolonged viral infection, and such mice had an increased morbidity and mortality compared to control, nondecomplemented mice. Similarly increased viral growth has been reported in the brains of decomplemented mice after subcutaneous inoculation of Sindbis virus [Hirsh et al, 1980bl. There are a variety of cells in the human body with C3b receptors, including neutrophils, macrophages, B lymphocytes, and perhaps cytotoxic killer cells [Frank, 19791 . Thus deposition of Cf3 to the RSV-infected cells observed in the present study might be assumed to play a role in reducing the viral antigenic mass especially in the early phase of the infection, when RSV antibody is either absent or present in low titers [McIntosh et al, 19781 . Neutrophils and macrophages can play an important role in the early phase of infection either by phagocytosis or by neutrophil-mediated cytotoxicity. Such complement-dependent neutrophil-mediated cytolysis of herpes virus-infected cells has been demonstrated [Grewal et al, 19801 .",
