The properties of both drugs predict dramatic accumulation in lysosomes, with calculated lysosomal drug concentrations that exceed cytosolic and extracellular concentrations by more than 50 000-fold. These predictions are consistent with previously reported experimentally measured cellular and extracellular concentrations of azithromycin. This is also reflected in the very large volumes of distribution of these drugs, which are among the highest of all drugs currently in use. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin produces very high local concentrations in lysosomes. The clinical significance of this observation is unclear; however, the magnitude of this mechanism of drug accumulation via ion-trapping in lysosomes could be an important factor for the pharmacodynamic effects of this drug combination.",

However, other clinical studies could not confirm these early findings [3] and there are considerable concerns about the safety of this drug combination [4] . The present communication discusses some common pharmacokinetic properties of these two drugs that may be linked to a potential underlying mechanism of action for their pharmacological activity. Fig. 1 shows the chemical structures of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Although the two compounds are from two chemically distinct classes, they have a structural similarity that is pharmacokinetically relevant. Both compounds are multibasic amines with pKa values that are susceptible to protonation in the physiological pH range. Azithromycin has two nitrogens with pKa values of 8.1 and 8.8 [5] . Hydroxychloroquine has three nitrogens with pKa values of 4.0, 8.3 and 9.7 [6] .",

This is particularly relevant for the intracellular distribution of basic drugs crossing between the cytosol (pH approx. 7.4) and the acidic lysosomal space (pH approx. 5.0). Fig. 2 shows this distribution conceptually. Basic compounds are in an equilibrium of a less polar unionized form (B) that can easily cross membranes, and a polar protonated form (BH + ) that cannot easily cross membranes. As the unionized drug enters the acidic environment of the lysosome, it will be protonated and 'trapped' in the lysosome as the protonated form BH + cannot easily diffuse back into the cytosol. As a result, high concentrations of the compound can accumulate in lysosomes. This concept of \"ion-trapping\" has been described and reviewed [7, 8] . The magnitude of this accumulation depends on the mathematical relationship of the pKa of the compound of interest, its permeability, and the pH gradient between the two environments (e.g. cytosol [pH 7.4] and lysosome [pH 5.0]). If there is no permeability limitation, the expected ratio or concentration gradient can be calculated based on the well-known Henderson-Hasselbalch equation [8] . If the compound of interest has only one basic group, the ratio between the concentrations will be:",

This is confirmed by the known pharmacokinetic parameters for hydroxychloroquine derived from plasma concentrations. After intravenous administration to healthy volunteers (average weight 63.5 kg), the volume of distribution of hydroxychloroquine was reported to be over 44 000 L, which is equivalent to approximately 700 L/kg [9] . This means that most of the drug in the body resides in the tissues, which is consistent with the predicted extraordinarily high lysosomal accumulation ratio. Furthermore, it explains the very long half-life (approximately 40 days) reported in the same study.

After administration of azithromycin, a large fraction of the dose will reside in lysosomes where it also binds to acidic phospholipids [10] [11] [12] [13] . A clinical study supports azithromycin lysosomal accumulation [14] . In this study, the experimentally measured average total azithromycin concentrations in polymorphonuclear white blood cells (PMLs) was over 14 000 ng/mL. However, the model-predicted unionized azithromycin concentration of 6.0 ng/mL in the cytosol of PMLs was comparable to the measured interstitial concentrations in the muscle (8.7 ng/mL) and subcutis (4.1 ng/mL). Hence, the measured concentrations in white blood cells was approximately 2000-fold higher than the measured unbound concentrations in the interstitial space. Considering the lysosomal volume is estimated to range between 0.5 to 5% of the cellular volume depending on cell type [14] [15] [16] [17] , these concentrations are consistent with the expected magnitude of lysosomal accumulation and explain these very high cellular concentrations.",

Due to the alkalization of endosomes, chloroquine was an effective in vitro treatment against Chikungunya virus when added to Vero cells prior to virus exposure. A pH-dependent mechanism of entry of coronavirus into target cells was also reported for SARS-CoV-1 [29] . The activation step that occurs in endosomes at acidic pH results in fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, leading to the release of the viral SARS-CoV-1 genome into the cytosol. In the absence of antiviral drug, the virus is targeted to the lysosomal compartment where the low pH, along with the action of enzymes, disrupts the viral particle, thus liberating the infectious nucleic acid and, in several cases, enzymes necessary for its replication. Hence, the lysosomal space has been proposed as a major target site to tackle SARS-CoV-2 [30] .",

Prolongation of QT interval and cases of torsades de pointes have been reported for both drugs [18, 33] . Hydroxychloroquine prolongs the QT interval and, according to its prescribing information, should not be administered with other drugs that have the potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias [33] . There may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if the drug is used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs [4] . Most relevant interaction data with azithromycin is available for chloroquine. QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine (1000 mg) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin (500 mg, 1000 mg, and 1500 mg once daily) [18] . Co-administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose-and concentration-dependent manner. Compared with chloroquine alone, the maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) increases in QTcF were 5 (10) ms, 7 (12) ms and 9 (14) ms with the co-administration of 500 mg, 1000 mg and 1500 mg azithromycin, respectively. Furthermore, studies in pigs revealed that azithromycin/chloroquine combinations did not increase cardiac instability [34] . In a clinical interaction study between azithromycin and chloroquine, no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic changes were observed [23] .",

More investigations with hydroxychloroquine are needed as well as finetuning the optimum dosing regimen to get a clearer picture of the expected risk-benefit assessment in these severe infections. These dose optimization attempts will have to utilize ways to estimate the respective infection site concentration; this is very challenging due to the tremendous differences in subcellular concentrations. Average tissue concentrations based on lung/blood ratios obtained from animal studies have been proposed and applied but may not be appropriate for dose optimization [35] .",

Basic compounds are in an equilibrium of a less polar unionized form (B) that can easily cross membranes, and a polar protonated form (BH + ) that cannot easily cross membranes. As the unionized drug enters the acidic environment of a lysosome, it will be protonated and 'trapped' in the lysosome as the protonated form BH + cannot easily diffuse back into the cytosol. As a result, high concentrations of the compound can accumulate in the lysosomes. Magnitude of lysosomal ion-trapping depending on the pKa of the compound of interest. For a monobasic compound (A), up to 250-fold higher concentrations are possible depending on pKa. For a dibasic compound (B), the accumulation can be over 60 000-fold. These simulations assume a pH gradient of 5.0 (lysosomes) and 7.4 (cytosol).",
