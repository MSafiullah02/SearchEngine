However, experiments performed in our laboratory to induce hypersecretion diarrhoea by inoculation of newly-weaned piglets with ETEC, possessing fimbrial adhesins and producing heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (STa and STb) enterotoxins, were not always successful (Cox et al., 1986a) . Post-weaning diarrhoea has a multifactorial etiology. The genetic susceptibility of the host to adhesion of ETEC as well as nutritional, environmental and immunological factors and the presence of a rotavirus infection can probably seriously influence the occurrence and the severity of the diarrhoea (Tzipori etal., 1980; Lecce et al., 1982; Lecce, 1983; Sellwood, 1983; Bijlsma et al., 1985) .",

Since rotavirus is enzootic in Belgian piggeries and most pigs are infected before the age of 6 to 7 weeks (Debouck, 1984) , we inoculated piglets with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus, a coronavirus, prior to ETEC infection. This combined infection resulted in pronounced diarrhoea and hypovolaemia and in 100% mortality within 5 days of TGE virus inoculation (Cox et al., 1986b) . We recently reported the effect of the antisecretory drugs chlorpromazine, verapamil, clonidine and propranolol on diarrhoea and survival in our piglet diarrhoea model Cools et al., 1987) . Several studies suggest the involvement of prostaglandins as important messengers in the secretory response of the enterocytes to bacterial enterotoxins (Bennett, 1971; Wise et al., 1983; Powell, 1986) . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID's), which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis by blocking the cyclooxygenase pathway, have been shown to reduce cholera or ETEC-induced hypersecretion in several species (Willard, 1985; Greenough & Rabbani, 1986) . However, in clinical trials in man, aspirin and indomethacin were ineffective in the treatment of cholera-induced hypersecretion diarrhoea (Greenough & Rabbani, 1986) .",

The piglets were of mixed breeding (Pietrain x Belgian Landrace). They were individually housed at 27\u00b0C and allowed to drink UHT sterilized whole cow's milk ad libitum. On day 1 of the experiment the piglets were anaesthetized with 15 mg/kg methomidate (Hypnodil@, Janssen) and 2 mg/kg azaperone (Stressnil@, Janssen) and a Silastic catheter (Dow Corning) was implanted in the left carotid artery for daily blood sampling and pressure recording. To enhance ETEC colonization of the small intestine, the piglets were pretreated on days 1, 2 and 3 with chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin@, Parke-Davis; 1,875 mg/l milk). After a starvation period during the first three hours of day 4, the piglets were orally inoculated with TGE virus (1.66 x 106 pig infective dose/ animal). Twenty-four hours later (day 5) the piglets were again starved for 3 hours, after which 62 ml of a 1.4% NaHCO, solution was given intragastrically to prevent ,ETEC destruction. Fifteen minutes later they were each intragastrically inoculated with 10 ml of a suspension of two ETEC strains.

This virus multiplies in and destroys the absorptive cells of the villi of the small intestine, leading to malabsorption, dehydration and death in very young piglets (Lecce, 1983 ). In our model TGE virus, another enteropathogenic virus, was selected since rotavirus is enzootic in Belgian piggeries (Debouck, 1984) , since the effects of this coronavirus in swine are well characterized and since, like rotavirus, it infects only mature epithelial cells and does not infect the undifferentiated crypt cells. TGE virus consistently induces villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. The disease is most acute and almost invariably fatal in the very young piglet, in which vomiting and profuse diarrhoea can lead rapidly to dehydration and death. Young pigs over 3 weeks old, as in our study, experience a debilitating diarrhoea of 10 to 14 days duration but usually survive (Aitken, 1983; Whipp et al., 1985) . We recently demonstrated the adhesion of the two ETEC-strains used in our present study to the atrophic villi following TGE virus inoculation in newlyweaned pigs (Cox et al., in press ).",

As a consequence of malabsorption the accumulation of non-absorbable nutrients, such as lactose, promotes a rise in luminal osmotic pressure, encouraging fluid movement from blood to lumen. At present the osmotic effect is considered to be the major component of TGE virus diarrhoea (Aitken, 1983) .

In experiments on ETEC-induced and spontaneous diarrhoea in neonatal piglets a metabolic acidosis with low pH and an abrupt decrease in BE and an increase in Hct was also reported in dying animals (Andren & Persson, 1983) . Kutas and Szabo (1971) likewise reported low pH and BE values in diarrhoeic piglets, resulting from experimental E. coli infection. In shocked animals in our study, the BE values were lower than -10 mEq/l, a critical limit below which the prognosis should be considered poor, at least in neonatal piglets (Andren & Persson, 1983) .",

Results of studies on the effects of aspirin, indomethacin and other NSAID's are, however, somewhat inconsistent. In vivo, indomethacin inhibits secretion caused by Vibrio cholerae, cholera toxin and ST enterotoxin of E. coli. In vitro, this agent decreases the effects of CAMP and of drugs that stimulate the adenylate cyclase-CAMP system. In vivo, aspirin inhibits small intestinal secretion provoked by cholera toxin and E. coli LT enterotoxin but not E. coli ST enterotoxin (Donowitz et al., 1986) . In ligated calf's jejunal loops, salicylates reduced E. coli ST induced hypersecretion (Wise et al., 1983) . In the porcine jejunal loop, however, this NSAID was ineffective in reducing E. coli ST induced hypersecretion (Ahrens & Zhu, 1982) . The inhibitory effect of the NSAID's appears to be due to increased absorption, although it is associated with some inhibition of activation of the cyclic AMP-system by LT enterotoxin of Vibrio cholerue and E. coli.

It recently appears that arachidonic acid metabolites may play an important role in invasive, inflammatory diarrhoea, but not in secretory diarrhoea (Powell, 1986; Turnberg, 1986 ). In our model the dual infection induced inflammatory intestinal changes (unpublished observation), as consistently occur following TGE virus and STb enterotoxin exposure (Pensaert et al., 1970; Rose & Moon, 1985) .
