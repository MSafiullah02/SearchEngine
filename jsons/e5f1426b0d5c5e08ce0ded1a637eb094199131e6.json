A virus capsid can be generally described as a hollow symmetric protein oligomer or multimer made from several tens to many hundreds of copies of one or a few different types of folded polypeptides, the capsid protein (CP) subunits. Most CPs (or their individual structural domains if formed by more than one domain) can be ascribed to one of a very limited number of protein architectures or folds that can assemble into a limited number of quaternary structures (Chap. 2). In each virus, oligomerization of the CPs during capsid assembly normally leads to a defined type of symmetric quaternary structure. Only very few types of capsid symmetry are frequent. The basic types are helical ( Fig. 1.2 , top) and icosahedral ( Fig. 1.2 , bottom left and right).

However, evolution has led to different structural solutions to make very large viral capsids with icosahedral symmetry, made of hundreds of chemically identical CP subunits, that can enclose very large genomes ( Fig. 1.2 bottom right) . Many large capsids containing many subunits are made of only one type of CP that is capable to adopt different quasiequivalent (similar) conformations (given by the triangulation number T); this feature allows the CP molecule to fit into T non-equivalent positions in the icosahedral capsid (see Chap. 2 for a detailed description). This evolutionary strategy minimizes the amount of genetic information required to encode the capsid. Icosahedral capsids are extremely frequent; they occur in about half the virus families.

Many other viruses infect prokaryotic cells such as bacteria (prokaryotic viruses). Bacterial viruses are usually called bacteriophages or, simply, phages. Archea are also infected by viruses (archeal viruses). Most viruses have evolved to infect one or a few species of organisms (limited host range) and one or a few cell types (specific tropism).

It must be noted here that genetic recombination and horizontal gene transfer between even very different, unrelated viruses are frequent. Thus, viruses of widely different origins could share some evolutionarily closely related genes, and of course the proteins these genes encode.

In 1973 the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) was established, and a general database on viruses was created later (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb). Known viruses have been classified into seven major groups based on the type of nucleic acid genome (Baltimore classification). These groups are: I: dsDNA viruses; II: ssDNA viruses; III: dsRNA viruses; IV: ssRNA(+) viruses; V: ssRNA (\u00c0) viruses; VI: ssRNA(+) virus whose replication involves the action of a reverse transcriptase (RT) that synthesize DNA from a RNA template; VII: dsDNA viruses whose replication involves the action of an RT (see Table 1 .1).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1403, "end": 1410, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Classification of Viruses"}, {"text": "In addition to their classification according to type of nucleic acid genome, viruses have been classified by ICTV in a number of taxonomic groups (taxons): viral order, family, subfamily, genus, and species.

Viruses in a same family probably share a not too distant evolutionary relationship, as established mainly by comparative sequence analysis. There are currently 94 recognized virus families; only 22 of these families have been grouped in 6 orders (Caudovirales, Herpesvirales, Mononegavirales, Nidovirales, Picornavirales, Tymovirales; see Table 1 .1); the remaining families have not been assigned to any order yet.

The possibility of artifacts is greatly reduced compared to conventional EM. Even more important, cryo-EM is invariably used together with three-dimensional reconstruction techniques that average the images of thousands of virus particles visualized in different orientations, and result in a volumetric (three-dimensional) structural model of the imaged particles. Because the images of so many individual particles are averaged, different artifacts affecting different individual particles make very little contribution to the averaged model, and the signal-to-noise ratio is greatly increased. Also, as no staining agent needs to be used, the structural model obtained reveals also the anatomy (internal structure) of the viral particle. The typical resolution achieved on virus particles was, until relatively recently, about 1 nm or less, but in the last years cryo-EM models of some virus particles with a resolution around 0.5 nm, or even higher, have been obtained, thus approaching atomic resolution.

Its greatest advantage as a static virus imaging technique is that the structure of single particles can be determined in liquid, in close to physiological conditions. Most importantly, AFM can also be used as a dynamic imaging technique, where structural changes can be followed in real time (see below). A clear disadvantage is that, like conventional EM but unlike cryo-EM, cryo-ET, X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, only the surface topography of the object (not its internal structure), can be determined. Because of basic geometric considerations regarding the tip-sample interaction, care has to be exercised in interpreting the images obtained (see Chap. 8).

This so-called breathing tends to transiently increase exposure to solvent of some structural elements in the particle, including functional CP peptide segments, and these events may be biologically required during some steps of the viral cycle. Capsid breathing can be modulated by internal components or capsid-bound external molecules. In the PV and HRV virions a large hydrophobic cavity (pocket) is involved both in breathing, and in facilitating a transition of the particle from a metastable conformation to another conformation during cell receptor recognition and nucleic acid uncoating. Binding of antiviral agents to the hydrophobic pocket (see Chap. 20), or of a virus-neutralising antibody to a region nearby, or mutations in the capsid that may partly fill the pocket were shown to impair viral breathing. The same factors also impair the transition between the metastable and final states of the capsid. The above and other results indicate that global or local conformational dynamics (breathing) may be a general feature in virus particles, and may be required for infection by facilitating structural transitions. Very recent AFM studies have revealed that different regions in viral particles can differ in mechanical stiffness, and indicate that local regions in the particle with high mechanical flexibility may also present high conformational dynamism which may be biologically relevant (see Chap. 18).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus Dynamics"}, {"text": "Conformational rearrangements in mature virions. Excess stability and rigidity may lead to a biologically inert virion, unable to replicate in a host cell. In addition to conformational dynamism at equilibrium, metastable virions respond to the appropriate stimuli by undergoing controlled conformational transitions required for infectivity. In non-enveloped viruses, the entire viral particle may be conformationally rearranged, although the greatest alterations may sometimes be localized (Chap. 15). In enveloped viruses, a particular structural component (e.g., an envelope glycoprotein on the surface) may change its conformation (Chap. 16). The transitions must be controlled through the action of regulatory factors, to ensure they occur at the appropriate location and time. The same conformational rearrangements caused by physiological factors can be frequently induced in vitro, even under non-physiological conditions using different agents (e.g., changes in temperature or pH). These facts have facilitated the ex vivo or in vitro studies of capsid conformational rearrangements using a vast array of techniques. In some cases, the biological relevance of the transitions observed is not yet clear. In other cases, the identified capsid rearrangements have been shown to be biologically required. These structural changes may be required, for example, for exit of the virion from the cell compartment or the cell where it was formed, entry into another cell, intracellular transport, or uncoating of the viral genome.

FMDV cannot escape from neutralization by any of these antibodies through mutation of nearly any one of the residues critically involved in antibody binding, because these are precisely the ones critically involved also in cell receptor binding.

I would like to end this chapter with a note intended for the young student: Truly inspiring views of coral reefs are obtained not by snorkeling, but by diving. William Beebe recommended readers of his 1928 book Beneath Tropic Seas (Putnam's sons, NY): \"Don't die without having borrowed, stolen, purchased or made a helmet of sorts, to glimpse for yourself this new world\".
