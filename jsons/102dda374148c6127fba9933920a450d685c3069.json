Two simple methods have been developed very recently for predicting palmitoylation sites, but the sensitivity (the prediction accuracy of palmitoylation sites) of both methods is low (< 65%). A regularised bio-basis function neural network is implemented in this paper aiming to improve the sensitivity. A set of protein sequences with experimentally determined palmitoylation sites are downloaded from NCBI for the study. The protein-oriented cross-validation strategy is used for proper model construction. The experiments show that the regularised bio-basis function neural network significantly outperforms the two existing methods as well as the support vector machine and the radial basis function neural network.

In biochemistry and enzymology study, it has been observed that this hydrophobic proteinmodification activity uses cellular and viral membrane proteins for signal transmission [1] . It is still unknown what the molecular signals for palmitoylation are. Although palmitoylation is known to be a reversible activity with cycles of acylation and deacylation, the relevant enzymatic mechanism has not been completely known because some palmitated proteins are found without any enzyme source present. Despite of these observations, palmitoylation activity has been widely studied in various areas including most signalling pathway activities [2] , [3] . For instance, Smotrys et al showed that most trafficking and protein-protein interactions as well as enzyme activities depend on the existence of palmitated proteins [4] . They also showed that palmitated proteins can enhance the membrane interactions and the reversibility of palmitoylation is an attractive mechanism for regulating protein activity and cell signalling. Li and Yang have found that most palmitoylation-deficient mutant Env proteins are soluble when extracted by ice-cold TX-100 and stay at the bottom of the gradients in their study of the association between the Maurine leukaemia virus Env protein and lipid rafts [5] . Palmitoylation has also been studied in diseaserelated subjects. For instance, Yu and Lee have found that two cysteine residues (257 and 261) at the C-terminal of NS4B have lipid modifications (palmitoylation) in studying the polymerization of Hepatitis C virus NS4B protein [6] . They concluded that site-specific mutagenesis of these cysteine residues are important for protein-protein interactions in the formation of HCV RNA replication complex. Another example of disease-related biology study of palmitoylation activity is vacuolar events. Peng and Tang showed that palmitoylation targets Vac8p to specific membrane sub-domains for vacuole homotypic fusion at three cysteine residues (4, 5 and 7) [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 323, "end": 326, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 785, "end": 788, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 791, "end": 794, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 963, "end": 966, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1434, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1712, "end": 1715, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2140, "end": 2143, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Specificity study of post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, methylation, sumoylation and palmitoylation is a very important subject in systems biology research for understanding how proteins are responding to extracellular cues for information transmission along signalling pathways.

We don't want a model to overfit the training data in any circumstances. Cross-validation or jackknife is certainly a way for achieving this goal. However, the fundamental principle of cross-validation has been very often abused in data mining protein peptides. In using cross-validation, one important principle is that we cannot use a data set which has any information exposed to training for evaluation. If this happens, the model can be very likely over-evaluated. However, in many applications, this important issue has not been seriously addressed. Subsequences or peptides are normally generated through scanning all the available protein sequences at first. These generated peptides are then pooled together and then randomly divided for cross-validation. With this strategy, we may almost over-evaluate a model or an algorithm. The reason is very simple. Each protein sequence can be treated as a small world in which mutation (although the underline mechanism of it has not yet been completely known) happens in a specific way which may differ from other protein sequences. If we have generated peptides before cross-validation, some peptides generated from a protein sequence can be randomly picked up for training and some peptides generated from the same protein sequence can be randomly picked up for testing. This means that the pattern in testing peptides have already partially known in training! To handle this problem, we have proposed a new strategy called protein-oriented crossvalidation [49] , [50] . The core principle of the protein-oriented cross-validation is to divide protein sequences into k folds at first. For each sequence in each fold, a sliding window is applied to generate peptides. Cross-validation simulation is then run based on peptides in these folds. Logos   Fig 1 and 2 show the sequence logos for palmitated and non-palmitated peptides.
