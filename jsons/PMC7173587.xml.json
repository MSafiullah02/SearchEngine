The virus infection is indicated by the more or less characteristic changes that the virus causes in cell cultures (cytopathic changes and cell death, the formation of viral antigens, haemagglutinin, or interferon etc.; see\nChapter 11) or by the appearance of disease in experimental animals. In some cases, for example in myxovirus infections, the production of haemagglutinin is readily demonstrated by the addition of erythrocytes, which adhere to the surface of the infected tissue-culture cells (haemadsorption, HAd). An isolate of virus can be identified, typed, by neutralization tests or other antigen-antibody reactions, for example by immunofluorescence staining of infected cells, haemagglutination inhibition etc. (see description of methods below).",

The test is usually performed by incubating a series of dilutions of serum with a fixed dose of infectious virus, usually 100 ID50 (= 100 times the dose of virus which can infect 50 per cent of inoculated cell cultures), during a fixed time, for example one hour at +37\u00b0C or overnight at +4\u00b0C. The mixtures are then inoculated into susceptible cultures or experimental animals. The dilution of serum which can inhibit virus growth in 50 per cent of the infected cultures or animals is taken as the neutralization titre. In order to obtain reproducible results it is important that constant time and temperature for incubation of virus and antibodies are maintained, that the same cell type is used, and that the tests are read after a fixed time period. Preparations of certain virus strains contain aggregates of virions which are difficult to neutralize and therefore have to be removed, for example by ultrafiltration, before the neutralization test is carried out. The serum samples are usually inactivated at +56\u00b0C for 30 minutes before use, but for an effective neutralization of certain enveloped viruses, for example rubellavirus, there is need for the presence of a complement which may be added in the form of fresh serum.",

The inoculated cultures can be covered by a layer of agar-containing medium and the antibody titre scored as the dilution which gives a 50 per cent reduction in the number of plaques. In order to allow automation and to save reagents, the cells may be cultivated and the neutralization test performed in the small wells of a microtitre plate made of disposable plastic. The end point of the serum titration can often be read on the bases of metabolic inhibition: cells which are actively metabolizing acidify the medium and the colour of the pH indicator is changed. This occurs in the wells where the virus has been neutralized but not in cultures where the virus infection has interfered with the cellular metabolism or destroyed the cells. If needed, the type-specificity of the neutralization tests can be increased to allow a comparison between closely related virus strains. This is performed either in the classic way by crosswise absorption of sera with the respective antigens or by kinetic neutralization. In the latter case the neutralization effect is measured by inoculation into cell cultures after varying times of incubation of the virus -serum mixture.",

These inhibitors are of a varying nature for the different viruses; glyoproteins and thermolabile inhibitors in the case of influenza virus; lipoproteins in the case of rubellavirus and other togaviruses etc. Consequently, the methods used to remove these inhibitors vary. Serial dilutions of sera which have been properly treated are incubated with an antigen amount corresponding to 4 times the minimum haemagglutinating dose. After these two ingredients have been allowed to interact, red blood cells are added and allowed to sediment. They form different bottom patterns depending upon whether they are agglutinated or agglutination has been blocked by antibodies.

Commercial RIA and ELISA tests are becoming available to an increasing extent, and many virus laboratories have developed their own RIA and ELISA techniques for various viruses. Once the specificity requirements are met with, these assays can readily be standardized and automized. The RIA technique involves the use of radioactive isotopes, and therefore carries certain disadvantages for the working environment as well as for the stability of the reagents. Also, the reading of results of the RIA technique requires the availability of more expensive equipment (i.e. gamma counter) than does the ELISA test.",

However, when these sensitive methods are used for indirect determination of IgM by use of antibodies against human IgM, it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of non-specific reactions because of the presence of rheumatoid factors. In order to avoid this problem the factor or IgG has to be eliminated before performance of the test. Alternatively, antibodies against human IgM adsorbed onto the plastic surface may be employed to capture IgM from the test sample. Specific IgM is then tested for by incubation with viral antigen labelled with the indicator (radioactive isotope or enzyme). This variant also excludes the competition by high-titre specific IgG present in patient serum.",

Many viruses often give inapparent infections or are excreted for a long time after the acute disease. Serological cross-reactions between related viruses should also be considered, for example between mumps and other paramyxoviruses, between herpes simplex and varicella-zoster virus and between different enteroviruses. These cross-reactions, which most often are encountered in CF tests, are common if the patient has been previously exposed to a related virus. On the other hand, cross-reactions are used routinely for group diagnosis of certain infections such as those caused by influenza and adenoviruses.",
