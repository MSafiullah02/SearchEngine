While infectious bronchitis (IB) is considered primarily a disease of the respiratory system, different IBV strains may show variable tissue tropisms and also affect the oviduct and the kidneys, with serious consequences. Some strains replicate in the intestine but apparently without pathological changes. Pectoral myopathy has been associated with an important recent variant. Several factors can influence the course of infection with IBV, including the age, breed and nutrition of the chicken, the environment and intercurrent infection with other infectious agents. Immunogenic components of the virus include the S (spike) proteins and the N nucleoprotein. The humoral, local and cellular responses of the chicken to IBV are reviewed, together with genetic resistance of the chicken. In long-term persistence of IBV, the caecal tonsil or kidney have been proposed as the sites of persistence. Antigenic variation among IBV strains is related to relatively small differences in amino acid sequences in the S1 spike protein. However, antigenic studies alone do not adequately define immunological relationships between strains and cross-immunisation studies have been used to classify IBV isolates into 'protectotypes'. It has been speculated that changes in the S1 protein may be related to differences in tissue tropisms shown by different strains. Perhaps in the future, new strains of IBV may arise which affect organs or systems not normally associated with IB.",

The study of mechanisms of pathogenicity was recently placed at the top of the research objectives proposed for priority treatment by an ad hoc group on vaccinology (Bourne, 1996) . However, pathogenesis cannot be studied without also considering immunology and mechanisms of protection. This review attempts to concisely present the current state of knowl-edge on the immunopathogenesis of infection in chickens with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).",

Following infection of chickens with IBV, falls in egg production and quality were reported for the first time by Van Roekel et al. (1951) and Broadfoot & Smith (1954) . In 1962, Cumming found that IBV was the cause of nephrosis-nephritis syndrome seen in Australia. In more recent years, IBV has also been isolated from cloacal swabs and gut tissues, but while infection has sometimes been associated with diarrhoea, no pathological changes have been described in the alimentary tract. Swollen head syndrome (SHS) in chickens has generally been associated with infection with the avian pneumovirus (APV), turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV) (Picault et al, 1987; Lu et al, 1994) . However, in the first description of SHS, Morley & Thomson (1984) isolated a coronavirus, while in other reports, Massachusetts strains of IBV have also been isolated (Shirai et al., 1993; Droual & Woolcock, 1994) . Recently, a variant strain of IBV, 793/B was isolated from broiler breeder flocks where the affected birds had bilateral myopathy affecting both superficial and deep pectoral muscles (Gough et ah, 1992) .",

The authors proposed that this method could be used to compare the pathogenicity of different strains or susceptibility of different breeds to IBV. Cubillos et al.

Dhinakar Raj & Jones (1996c) also reported little difference among seven IBV strains using measurement of ciliary activity as a criterion for damage to the tracheal epithelium. Of nine strains compared in TOC by Cubillos et al (1991) , the hyperplasia caused by two viruses was the only histological difference. IBV infections may not occur as a single entity in the field. With the presence of several respiratory diseases in chickens caused by bacteria and viruses, the role of these agents in increasing the severity of IBV or otherwise is an important contributory factor in influencing the pathogenesis of the disease (see later).",

In vitro, oviduct organ cultures (OOC) were highly susceptible to the H52 strain of IBV regardless of the age of the chickens and no differences in susceptibility were seen between magnum and uterus regions . Pradhan et al. (1984) showed that IBV strain M41 causes stasis of cilia in OOC prepared from precociously-induced oviducts in young chicks by oestrogen treatment. This work has been extrapolated to compare the virulence of seven strains of IBV in vitro using ciliostasis and a calmodulin assay to quantify the damage to oviduct epithelium (Dhinakar Raj & Jones, 1996c ). An IBV isolate belonging to serotype D207 was the most virulent while an enterotropic variant strain G was the least.",

The relative kidney weight and kidney asymmetry are increased. The haematocrit values of infected birds was decreased and plasma uric acid levels were increased (Afanador & Roberts, 1994) . Despite lack of gross lesions microscopic changes of nephritis may still be present (Winterfield & Albassam, 1984) . Chen et al., (1996) proposed that IBV-induced renal lesions can be considered to be a ductotubular interstitial nephritis. The virus causes granular degeneration, vacuolation and desquamation of the tubular epithelium with massive infiltration of heterophils in the interstitium in acute stages of the disease. The changes in the chronic phase were classified as being active or inactive types of interstitial lymphocytic nephritis (Albassam et al., 1986) . The chronic inactive form of nephritis was indicative of IBV replication in the kidneys and subsequent clearance; while the chronic active type suggested a persistent viral replication and damage to epithelial cells of the kidney tubules. Virus was isolated from 50% of the birds with chronic nephritis (Chong & Apostolov, 1982) . The histopathological changes in the kidneys following NIBV infections have been described by several workers (Albassam et al., 1986; Chen et al., 1996; Pohl, 1974; Purcell et al, 1976; Siller & Cumming, 1974) .",

In vitro explants of several gut tissues have been shown to support the growth of IBV (Bhattacharjee, 1994; Bhattacharjee & Jones, 1997; Darbyshire et al, 1976) . In studies where virus isolation was attempted from several tissues, maximum virus isolations were obtained from the oesophagus of chickens infected with ECV2, an enteric isolate of IBV (Lucio & Fabricant, 1990) and 793/B-like virus (Dhinakar Raj & Jones, 1996a) . Oesophageal swabs have also been used to identify IBV using the polymerase chain reaction (D. Cavanagh, personal communication). However, it is not clear whether the virus actually multiplies in the oesophagus or whether virus is swallowed after being expelled from the trachea. IBV has also been isolated from proventriculus, duodenum and jejunum (Ambali & Jones, 1990; Lucio & Fabricant, 1990) . Darbyshire et al, (1976) have shown that proventriculus was inferior only to respiratory tissues and oviduct in supporting virus multiplication in vitro. However, the site of virus multiplication in these tissues has not been confirmed, but presumably occurs in the epithelial cells.",

It seems that studies on the replication of IBV in the gut have been neglected, probably because no IBV strain has been demonstrated to be enteropathogenic. MacDonald et al. (1983) reported that following crop inoculation of chicks with H52 and H120 vaccines, virus was rarely isolated from the gut or any other visceral tissues and no antibody response occurred. However, the kidneys were found to be resistant to i.v. challenge. More intensive studies on oral infection with enterotropic IBV strains or dual infections with the virus and other enteric pathogens, such as salmonella, coccidia or rotavirus, might yield more information on the effects of IBV replication in the gut.",

There was marked swelling and pallor of deep pectoral muscles together with the presence of occasional fascial haemorrhages and a layer of gelatinous oedema over its surface. Experimental infection of 6 week old broilers with an isolate of IBV belonging to this group resulted in mild oedematous separation of muscle fibres but with no corresponding increase in serum creatine kinase concentrations (Dhinakar Raj & Jones, 1996a ). It has been clearly shown that the virus was not involved directly in the pathogenesis of the muscle lesions but formation and deposition of immune complexes, such as those found in the kidneys (Dhinakar Raj & Jones, 1996a) , in the capillary walls of the muscle could be a possible reason for the development of this strange lesion.",

However, the duration of virus excretion in the faeces was longer in 2-week old infected chicks compared to 4-and 6-week-old chickens. As age increases chicks become more resistant to IBV-induced mortality (Smith et al., 1985) , nephropathic effects (Albassam et al., 1986) and oviduct lesions (Crinion & Hofstad, 1972a) . Mac-Donald et al.

Purchase et al. (1966) demonstrated variation in mortality following IBV inoculation of embryos from different inbred lines. Bumstead et al. (1989) compared mortalities in several inbred lines of chickens following inoculation with a pool of strains of IBV and/or Escherichia coli and found marked differences among them. On this basis, the lines of chickens were classified as being resistant or sensitive to IBV. However, these inbred lines did not show marked differences in susceptibility to the variant strain of IBV, 793/B (Parsons et al, 1992) .",

In contrast, later work by Kleven et al, (1972) found that airsacculitis resulted when chickens were infected with IB and Newcastle disease (ND) vaccines after MS infection. Hopkins & Yoder (1982) , in similar experiments with MS, gave different strains of IBV 2 to 5 days before the mycoplasma. They showed that different strains of IBV had differing abilities to induce airsacculitis. Field isolates of IBV had the most severe effects. Vaccines of high passage produced very mild lesions while those of low passage caused intermediate lesions. Gross (1958) , in one of the first studies, infected 5-week-old chickens with IBV and gave pathogenic E. coli by aerosol at intervals afterwards. The most severe pericarditis was seen when the bacteria were given 11 to 22 days after the virus. Smith et al. (1985) , using a combined inoculation of a pool of strains of IBV and E. coli, developed an experimental model for IBV which closely resembled natural outbreaks of the disease. The damage to tracheal epithelium caused by IBV facilitates E. coli invasion and multiplication leading to death or lesions in surviving chickens. Using this model, several reports have described differences in virulence of IBV strains, differences in susceptibility between genetic lines of chickens and detailed interactions between the agents (Avellanda et al., 1994; Bumstead et al, 1989; Cook et al, , 1991b Cubillos et al, 1991; Smith et al, 1985) . Raggi et al. (1967b) showed that when IBV and Haemophilus paragallinarum were given together intra-nasally, the incubation period was shorter, there was higher mortality and lesions were more severe.",

APV, the cause of TRT and mild respiratory disease in chickens may also occur in respiratory outbreaks involving IBV, but the significance of these two agents being present together is yet to be reported. Fabricant & Levine (1962) examined triple infections involving IBV, MG and pathogenic E. coli. They reported that with regard to disease lesions the descending order of severity was IBV, MG and E. coli; MG and E. coli; IBV and E. coli; and E. coli alone. A similar study by Nakamura et al.

Local immunity at the oviduct level has been shown by demonstration of virus-specific IgG and IgA in the oviduct washes of infected hens (Dhinakar Raj & Jones, 1996b) . It was found that in addition to local production, antibodies also transuded from the serum later in the course of infection, but their value in protection of the oviduct has not been determined.

It plays an important role in the development of vaccinal immunity since vaccines are generally given by spray or eye-drop. Davelaar & Kouwenhoven (1981) reported that the protection against IBV of day-old ocular-vaccinated chickens was localized mainly in the oculo-nasal mucosa and removal of the Harderian gland caused a decreased level of protection (Davelaar & Kouwenhoven, 1980) . IBV-specific IgA has been demonstrated in the lachrymal fluid Davelaar et al, 1982; and its synthesis in the Harderian gland has been shown (Davelaar et al, 1982) . IgG in tears was mainly serum-derived (Davelaar et al, 1982; Toro et al., 1993) . IgA levels in tears appeared to be better correlated with resistance to IBV re-infection (Toro & Fernandez, 1994) than levels of serum antibody (Yachida et al, 1985) and their measurement was recommended for antibody profiling of chicken flocks. Cook et al. (1992) found more IBV-specific IgA in the lachrymal fluids of chicken lines resistant to IBV while antibody titres in tracheal washes were similar. Variation in IBV-specific IgG levels in serum and IgA levels in lachrymal fluids has also been demonstrated in different chicken lines after ocular vaccination with IBV (Toro et al, 1996b) . It was found that light layer (white leghorn) chickens had a significantly higher and more homogenous serum IgG response between days 5 and 9 p.i., and lachrymal IgA response between days 5 and 14 p.i. than broiler or brown-egg (heavy) layer chicks.",

Ultrastructural and histochemical studies showed that though the type of damage to the tracheal epithelium following IBV infection was similar in both lines of chickens, lesions were more severe and longer lasting in the sensitive line (Nakamura et al, 1991) . The severity and duration of clinical infection in bursectomised line C chickens were similar to those seen in the sensitive line (Cook et al, 1991a) . However, no increase in mortality was observed, in contrast to high mortality recorded in line 151 chickens. Comparisons of secretory antibody responses between the two lines of chickens revealed increased local antibody secretion in the saliva and lachrymal fluid of the resistant line .",

For example, vaccination with H120 caused a 30,000-fold reduction in titres of the challenge virus, Australian 'T' strain (Darbyshire, 1985) , while on the basis of VN tests in vitro, no evidence of a serological relationship between these two viruses could be demonstrated . Hence, antigenic studies alone do not adequately define immunological relationships between strains. Thus, it was suggested that cross-immunization studies could be used to classify IBV isolates into protectotypes (Lohr, 1988) as this would reduce the large number of serotypes to a smaller number of protectotypes and provide more practical information to the field.",

Arvidson et al.

            "text": "Since tissue affinities are a function of the viral peplomer-mediated attachment of virus to cells, changes in the spike protein might lead to altered tropism of the virus. Six of ten differences in amino acid sequences of Gray and JMK strains of IBV were found between residues 99 and 127; hence it was postulated that this region may play a role in differences in tissue tropism exhibited by these viruses (Kwon & Jackwood, 1995) . However, no correlation was found by Sapats et al. (1996) between SI amino acid sequences and nephropathogenicity of nine Australian strains of IBV. Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to expect new variant strains of IBV to emerge with unusual tissue tropisms and such an example of this is strain 793/B. CONCLUSIONS IBV has been effectively controlled by the extensive use of vaccines but it still remains a major economic problem some 65 years after it was first reported. The constant emergence of variant strains has challenged vaccination strategies. With the advent of molecular techniques much of the recent work on IBV has concentrated on improved diagnostic and strain differentiation methods. However, the appearance and spread of the economically-important variant strain 793/B has given us a reminder of the need for a more detailed understanding of the immunopathogenesis of the disease and to be prepared for emergence of variants with unusual tissue tropisms and disease manifestations. tionstraktes angesehen wird, k\u00f6nnen verschiedene IBV-St\u00e4mme unterschiedliche Gewebstropismen aufweisen und, mit ernsten Folgen, auch den Eileiter und die Nieren befallen. Manche St\u00e4mme vermehren sich im Darm, anscheinend aber ohne pathologische Ver\u00e4nderungen. Pektorale Myopathie ist mit einer wichtigen neuen Variante in Verbindung gebracht worden. Mehrere Faktoren k\u00f6nnen den Verlauf der Infektion mit IBV beeinflussen und umfassen das Alter, die Rasse und die F\u00fctterung des Huhnes, die Umgebung und die interkurrente Infektion mit anderen Infektionserregern. Die immunogenen Bestandteile des Virus sind die S (spike)-Proteine und das N-Nukleoprotein. Die humoralen, lokalen und zellul\u00e4ren Reaktionen des Huhnes gegen IBV sowie die genetische Resistenz des Huhnes werden besprochen. Bei der langfristigen IBV-Persistenz sind die Blinddarmtonsillen oder die Nieren als Orte der Persistenz vermutet worden. Die Antigenvariation bei IBV-St\u00e4mmen h\u00e4ngt mit relativ kleinen Unterschieden der Aminos\u00e4uresequenzen im Spike-Protein S1 zusammen. Antigenuntersuchungen alleine reichen jedoch nicht aus, um immunologische Beziehungen zwischen Virusst\u00e4mmen ausreichend zu definieren, und Kreuzimmunisierungsversuche sind benutzt worden, um IBV-Isolate in 'Protektotypen' zu klassifizieren. Es sind Vermutungen dar\u00fcber angestellt worden, da\u00df Ver\u00e4nderungen im Spike-Protein S1 eine Beziehung zu Unterschieden der Gewebstropismen, die verschiedene St\u00e4mme aufweisen, haben k\u00f6nnten. Vielleicht k\u00f6nnten in der Zukunft neue IBV-St\u00e4mme auftauchen, die Organe oder Systeme befallen, welche normalerweise keinen Zusammenhang mit der IB haben.",

Algunas cepas se replican en el intestino pero aparentemente sin producir lesiones. Una reciente variante de IBV ha sido relacionada con la miopatia pectoral. Diversos factores pueden influir el euros de la infecci\u00f3n por IBV incluyendo la edad, estirpe y estado nutritivo del ave, el medio ambiente e infecciones intercurrentes con otros agentes infecciosos. Los componentes inmunog\u00e9nicos del virus incluyen las proteinas S y la nucleoprote\u00edna N. Se revisan las respuestas inmunes humorales y celulares de las gallinas frente a IBV asi como la resistencia gen\u00e9tica de la gallina. En situaciones de persistencia de IBV se considera que las tonsilas cecales o el ri\u00f1\u00f3n son los lugares probables de acantonamiento.
