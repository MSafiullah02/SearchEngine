Among the first 99 reported patients with an average age of 55.5 years, 2/3 were male and 50% suffered from chronic diseases (Chen et al, 2020). The disease rapidly spread to other provinces in China, neighboring countries, and eventually worldwide (Wang et al, 2020a; Wu & McGoogan, 2020; Zhu et al, 2020). The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease coronavirus disease 2019, COVID\u201019 (formerly known as 2019\u2010nCov), and the virus causing the infection was designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (Gorbalenya et al, 2020), belonging to the Coronaviridae family.",

As suggested for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, these two coronaviruses had a zoonotic origin with human\u2010to\u2010human transmission after their outbreak (de Wit et al, 2016). Deaths by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 were solely reported for the critical cases (49%), mainly for patients with preexisting comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, or cancer (Wu & McGoogan, 2020). Although COVID\u201019 has a milder clinical impairment compared to SARS and MERS for the vast majority of patients, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection shows dramatically increased human\u2010to\u2010human transmission rate with the total number of deaths significantly exceeding those of SARS and MERS patients already within the first three months of the COVID\u201019 outbreak. The emergent global spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and its strong impact on public health immediately demands for joint efforts in bio\u2010medical research increasing our understanding of the virus\u2019 pathogenesis, its entry into the host's cells, and host factors facilitating its fast replication that explains the high human\u2010to\u2010human transmission rates.",

            "text": "SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is an enveloped virion containing one positive\u2010strand RNA genome, and its sequence has already been reported (Chan et al, 2020; Lu et al, 2020; Wu et al, 2020a,c; Zhou et al, 2020). The genome of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 comprises 29.9 kb and shares 79.5% and 96% identity with SARS\u2010CoV and bat coronavirus, respectively (Zhou et al, 2020). Coronaviruses were reported to use different cellular entry mechanisms in terms of membrane fusion activities after receptor binding (White & Whittaker, 2016). SARS\u2010CoV was previously shown to bind to angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry, mediated via the viral surface spike glycoprotein (S protein; Gallagher & Buchmeier, 2001; Li et al, 2003; Simmons et al, 2013). Comparison of the SARS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S protein sequence revealed 76% protein identity (Wu et al, 2020c), and recent studies reported that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is also binding to ACE2 in vitro (Hoffmann et al, 2020; Walls et al, 2020; Yan et al, 2020; Zhou et al, 2020). Subsequently, the S protein is cleaved by the transmembrane protease serine 2 TMPRSS2 (Hoffmann et al, 2020). Simultaneously blocking TMPRSS2 and the cysteine proteases CATHEPSIN B/L activity inhibits entry of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in vitro (Kawase et al, 2012), while the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 entry was not completely prohibited in vitro (Hoffmann et al, 2020). It remains to be determined whether additional proteases are involved in priming of the SARS\u2010Cov\u20102 but not SARS\u2010CoV S protein. One candidate is FURIN as the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S protein contains four redundant FURIN cut sites (PRRA motif) that are absent in SARS\u2010CoV. Indeed, prediction studies suggest efficient cleavage of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 but not SARS\u2010CoV S protein by FURIN (Coutard et al, 2020; preprint: Wu et al, 2020b). Additionally, FURIN was shown to facilitate virus entry into the cell after receptor binding for several coronaviruses, e.g., MERS\u2010CoV (Burkard et al, 2014) but not SARS\u2010CoV (Millet & Whittaker, 2014). While FURIN is generally membrane\u2010bound, an active isoform has been described that can be secreted, potentially facilitating cleavage of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S protein in the cellular neighborhood (Vidricaire et al, 1993). In addition, although ACE2 was previously described to be expressed in the respiratory tract (Jia et al, 2005; Ren et al, 2006; preprint: Sungnak et al\n2020; Xu et al, 2020; preprint: Zhao et al\n2020; Zou et al, 2020), still little is known about the exact cell types expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 serving as entry point for SARS\u2010CoV and the currently emerging SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Therefore, there is an urgent need for investigations of tissues in the upper and lower airways in COVID\u201019 patients but also healthy individuals to increase our understanding of the host factors facilitating the virus entry and its replication, ultimately leading to treatment strategies of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections. As pointed out recently (Zhang et al, 2020b), our understanding of host genetic factors involved in COVID\u201019 disease outcome is still poor.",

All major cell types known to occur in the lung were identified (Fig 1B and C). Independent of the cell types present in the lung, the median ACE2 levels were below five counts per million (CPM) (Fig 1D), which given a typical mRNA content of 500,000 mRNA molecules per cell indicate that only about half of all cells were statistically expected to contain even a single ACE2 transcript. The reads per patient and cell type were therefore aggregated into pseudo\u2010bulks, and analysis was continued. As expected from prior literature, the AT2 cells showed highest ACE2 expression in the lung both in terms of their CPM values (Fig 1D, further referred to as ACE2\n+ cells, P\u2010values in Fig EV1) and the percentage of positive cells (Fig EV2). Further visualizations of expression levels and localization are shown in Fig EV3. The expression of TMPRSS2 across cell types of the lung (further referred to as TMPRSS2\n+ cells) was much stronger with a certain specificity for AT2 cells (Fig 1E, P\u2010values in Fig EV1), which is in agreement with other studies (preprint: Sungnak et al, 2020).",

In this dataset, we identified all expected cell types, including recently described and rare cell types such as FOXN4\u2010positive cells and ionocytes (Fig 1F, Appendix Fig S1 and S2). Expression levels of ACE2 were comparable or slightly elevated compared to the lung tissue samples, with the strongest expression being observed in a subset of secretory cells (\u201csecretory3\u201d; Figs 1G and EV1, EV2, EV3). Note that due to possible technical differences between single nuclei RNA\u2010Seq (lung) and single cell RNA\u2010Seq (HBECs), the CPM values are not quantitatively comparable. While TMPRSS2 was less strongly expressed in HBECs than in lung tissue cells, its expression was still markedly higher than that of ACE2 (Figs 1H and EV1, EV2, EV3). Interestingly, the cell population enriched for ACE2\n+ cells was also the one most strongly expressing TMPRSS2 (Figs 1G and H, and EV3). In the HBECs, a significant enrichment of the number of ACE2\n+/TMPRSS2\n+ double\u2010positive cells was observed (1.6\u2010fold enrichment, P = 0.002, Fig EV4).",

As RHO GTPases have been implicated in membrane remodeling and the viral replication cycle, especially entry, replication, and spread (Van den Broeke et al, 2014), transient secretory cells may be more permissive to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection adding to a potential vulnerability caused by considerably high co\u2010expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.

Therefore, we investigated the expression of FURIN, as SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 but not SARS\u2010CoV was reported to have a FURIN cleavage site in its S protein, potentially increasing its priming upon ACE2 receptor binding. In lung tissue, we detected an overall high expression of FURIN (Fig 3A). Across cell types, we observed a marked enrichment of the number of double\u2010 and triple\u2010positive cells for any combination of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and/or FURIN expression, indicating a preference for co\u2010expression (Figs 3B, EV2, and EV3). Interestingly, also transient secretory cells in the HBECs showed an intermediate expression of FURIN (Fig 3C). While TMPRSS2 and FURIN were less strongly expressed in HBECs than in distant cells from surgical lung tissue, their expression was still markedly higher compared to ACE2. In the HBECs, a significant enrichment of the number of ACE2\n+/TMPRSS2\n+ double\u2010positive cells was observed, while ACE2\n+/TMPRSS2\n+/FURIN\n+ enrichment did not reach significance (Fig 3D). The latter finding, however, may be due to differences in co\u2010expression or the generally lower number of positive cells reducing statistical power. Interestingly, our data showed that the additional possibility of priming the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S protein by FURIN would potentially render 25% more cells vulnerable for infection as compared to by exclusively TMPRSS2 S protein priming. Notably, FURIN was previously reported to be also secreted and active in neighboring cells (Vidricaire et al, 1993). Thereby, the expression of FURIN in only some cells in lung tissue or bronchial branches may have a strong impact on the entire cellular neighborhood, dramatically increasing the likelihood for an infection with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 of all ACE2+ cells in these tissues. However, the presence of the secreted FURIN protease in cells that do not express FURIN remains to be validated by biochemical approaches. Overall, our data suggest that FURIN might increase overall permissiveness of cells in the respiratory tract by potentially equipping more cells with proteolytic activity for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S protein priming after ACE2 receptor binding.",

Although the first reported cases suggested higher infection rates for males (Chen et al, 2020; Huang et al, 2020), no significant differences in the infection rate of males and females were found with increasing numbers of COVID\u201019 patients (Brussow, 2020; Wang et al, 2020b; Zhang et al, 2020a).

Since we only have samples from males of younger age available, we cannot study age dependencies for males here. However, when comparing ACE2 expression of all five female and three male samples in the young age group between 40 and 50 years of age, we see a clearly higher overall expression of ACE2 in males compared to females (P = 0.048).

While single cell RNA sequencing typically delivers higher quality data, the cells must be intact for processing, as damaged cells present a loss of RNA molecules with mitochondrial reads preferentially retained, introducing a skewed expression profile (Luecken & Theis, 2019). This is not observed in single nuclei RNA sequencing, as mitochondria are lost during nuclei isolation. In our HBEC data, we see a preferential increase in the percentage of mitochondrial reads in certain cell populations rather than across cell types, which may hint toward a physiologically increased energy requirement, for example, due to high levels of protein synthesis in secretory goblet cells (Appendix Fig S3). Adequate sampling of lung specimen for preparing suspensions of intact cells is often challenging. Single nuclei RNA sequencing also reveals transcriptome data on single cell level and can be used on frozen tissue. This method typically provides a more faithful estimate of cell type proportions due to lessened dissociation bias. On the other hand, it typically comes with less reads per cell and less genes detected (Bakken et al, 2018), although this bias seems low in our dataset, as the number of both detected genes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) is comparable across samples in both datasets (Appendix Fig S3). The identification of closely related cell populations is mostly concordant in both methods, with single cell RNA sequencing being inferior for detection of lowly expressed genes on a single cell level (Bakken et al, 2018).",

In addition to the presence of this FURIN cleavage site and experimental evidence that MERS\u2010CoV is primed by FURIN, recent data published by Hoffmann et al (2020) suggest an additional protease besides TMPRSS2 and CATHEPSIN B/L as blockage of both completely prohibited the entry of SARS\u2010CoV but not SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Further evidence for an involvement of FURIN in the entry of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 into the host cell comes from very recent studies predicting an increased binding affinity between the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S protein and the human ACE2 receptor as compared to the SARS\u2010CoV S protein (Wrapp et al, 2020; preprint: Wu et al, 2020b). Wu et al postulate that the cleavage of the S protein at the FURIN cut site might cause the increased binding affinity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to its receptor, e.g., triggered by structural rearrangements of the cleaved S protein as it was previously shown for other coronavirus S proteins (Kirchdoerfer et al, 2016; Walls et al, 2016; Wrapp et al, 2020).

Using our reference dataset, we were able to show co\u2010expression of ACE2 with TMPRSS2 and/or FURIN in both healthy human lung tissue and HBECs. The potential additional priming of cells for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection by FURIN together with evidence from literature that FURIN can be secreted and thereby even act in neighboring cells that do not express FURIN supports the hypothesis for increased human\u2010to\u2010human transmission rates due to the usage of FURIN during virus S protein priming.

Recent prediction studies suggest efficient cleavage of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 S protein by FURIN that might result in higher pathogenicity of the virus (Coutard et al, 2020; preprint: Wu et al, 2020b), potentially due to an increased affinity to the ACE2 receptor (Wrapp et al, 2020; preprint: Wu et al, 2020b). Further evidence for correlation of increased virus pathogenicity with FURIN priming arises from the observation that the presence of a FURIN\u2010like cleavage site positively correlated with pathogenicity for different influenza strains (Kido et al, 2012). It would be of great interest to also investigate FURIN expression in other organs with high ACE2 expression levels, e.g., in the datasets used by Sungnak et al (preprint: Sungnak et al, 2020), since those organs have been reported to be associated with severe symptoms in COVID\u201019 patients.",

Although both SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and MERS\u2010CoV are likely to be cleaved by FURIN during S protein priming, we speculate that the MERS\u2010CoV receptor DPP4 does not have any or high relevance for COVID\u201019 as DPP4 is solely expressed in lung cells but not in the subsegmental bronchial branches (Appendix Fig S4). Taken together, these data offer the interesting aspects that both high human\u2010to\u2010human transmission rate of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and the severe COVID\u201019 cases might be caused by additional cleavage sites, resulting in higher ACE2 binding affinity and/or more efficient membrane fusion.",

Subsequent cell type marker analysis revealed that these cells reflect differentiating cells on the transition from club or goblet to terminally differentiated ciliated cells, the latter having an important role in facilitating the clearance of viral particles (Sims et al, 2008; Dumm et al, 2019). RHO GTPase activating CIT and viral processes regulating pathways, i.e., processes related to membrane remodeling or the immune system, are strongly enriched in the transient secretory cells. Interestingly, about 40% of the ACE2\n+ transient secretory cells are co\u2010expressing the protease TMPRSS2 that is known to be involved in S protein priming, making this cell type potentially vulnerable for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. If we include FURIN as another protease priming in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 entry of the host cell, the percentage of transient secretory cells expressing the receptor ACE2 and either both or one of the proteases TMPRSS2 and FURIN increases in the lung to 50%.

Low\u2010quality cells were removed during pre\u2010processing using Seurat version 3.0.0 (https://github.com/satijalab/seurat) based on the following criteria: (a) > 200 or, depending on the sample, < 6,000\u20139,000 genes (surgical lung tissues)/< 3,000\u20135,000 genes (ALI cultures) and (b) < 15% mitochondrial reads (QC plots in Appendix Fig S3). The remaining data were further processed using Seurat for log\u2010normalization, scaling, merging, clustering, and gene expression analysis. Afterward, all control samples were merged using the \u201cFindIntegrationAnchors\u201d and \u201cIntegrateData\u201d functions with their results being merged again and used for downstream analysis. Monocle3 (Qiu et al, 2017; Cao et al, 2019) was used to infer cellular trajectories and dynamics. Dimensionality reduction, cell clustering, trajectory graph learning, and pseudo\u2010time measurement through reversed graph embedding were performed with this tool.",

For multiple\u2010way comparisons, the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test (Kruskal & Wallis, 1952) was used, followed by Dunn's post hoc test (Dunn, 1964). To calculate the P\u2010value for the overlap between sets, a hypergeometric test was employed. Expected molecule counts per cell were modeled using a binomial distribution and the observed detection probability. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using Metascape (Zhou et al, 2019) on the KEGG, Canonical pathways, GO, Reactome, and CORUM databases. P\u2010values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg method (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995).
