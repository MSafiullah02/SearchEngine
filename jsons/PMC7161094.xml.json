The project was approved by the ethics board of Jinan infectious hospital (No. 20200203). Informed consent was obtained from each patient or their guardian. All patients enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan for the new coronavirus infection formulated by the National Health Commission (trial version 5) [9]. Diagnostic criteria for asymptomatic cases: individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 who remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection with or without abnormal chest CT imaging findings. Diagnostic criteria for mild cases: mild clinical symptoms, no radiographic findings of pneumonia. Diagnostic criteria for common cases: fever, respiratory symptoms, and radiographic manifestations of pneumonia. Diagnostic criteria for severe cases: (1) respiratory distress, respiratory frequency \u2265 30 times/min; (2) hypoxemia, with resting oxygen saturation \u2266 93%; and (3) arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/oxygen absorption concentration (FiO2) \u2266 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa).The diagnostic criteria for critical cases: (1) respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation is required; (2) shock; and (3) complicated with other organ failure requiring ICU care. There are four types of infection: (1) imported cases defined as a history of a sojourn in Hubei Province within 14 days of onset of the illness. (2) Family cluster defined as 3 or more than 3 people with confirmed cases in one family. (3) Close contact defined as close contact with cases from Hubei Province. (4) Unclear; the method of infection is unknown. A child is defined as less than 18 years of age.",

Considering the physical characteristics of the children with lymphocytes making up 60% of the white blood cells before 6 years and the proportions of lymphocytes and neutrophils in white blood cells being close to that of adults after 6 years, we further analyzed the difference in blood cell counts between children over 6 years and adults. There are 5 cases over 6 years (35.7%) among 14 children cases, the neutrophil counts (1.62 \u00b1 0.34 \u00d7 109/L) were more decreased in children over 6 years than in adults (p = 0.02). however, lymphocyte counts (1.91 \u00b1 0.93 \u00d7 109/L) showed no difference (p = 0.41) between the two groups.

They have been categorized in three groups, alpha-CoVs, beta-CoVs, and gamma-CoVs according to phylogenetic analyses and antigenic criteria [11]. The human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, and the SARS-CoV-2 all belong to beta-CoVs [13]. The bat coronavirus (BCoV) and the SARS-CoV-2 share 96.2% sequence identity. Bats were once thought to be the source of SARS-CoV-2. However, sufficient evidence is lacking.",

There were no deaths reported because of few cases of the severe or critical type. The reason for this is considered as follows: (1) There is no major epidemic in the regions except Hubei Province for strong prevention and control and (2) the virulence and pathogenicity of the virus decrease in the 2nd and 3rd generation of transmission [16]. All cases of children belong to the mild or conventional type of COVID-19, and all children are part of family clusters. Previous studies found no cases in children, who were once thought to be less susceptible [17]. According to the current trend, all people including children are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and person-to-person transmission develops familial clusters [18]. The reason why all children are in family clusters is that it is the traditional Chinese New Year holiday, children have less chance to have contact with the outside world, and Chinese families always attach great importance to the protection of children.",

The findings showed that clinical symptoms were mild in children with fever and dry cough being the most common symptoms, and other symptoms were rare. However, dry cough and phlegm are not the most common symptoms in children compared with adults. This is because a lower inflammatory response to lung injuries causes milder clinical symptoms in children compared with adults.",

            "text": "Previous reports indicated that decreased lymphocytes counts were common clinical features, especially in severe cases [7, 8]. As a result of viral infection, white blood cell and lymphocyte counts can be reduced by consumption. However, similar results did not appear in our study, with only a total of 6 cases including 1 case of a child with decreased lymphocytes counts, and the value of lymphocytes counts showed no significant differences in children over 6 years compared with adults. On the other hand, neutrophil counts decreased in children compared with adults (p = 0.02). So, lymphocyte decline is not an important indicator for the diagnosis of childhood cases and the neutrophil count decline should be focused on. These may be due to a lower inflammatory response in children. SARS-CoV-2 infection may induced lung injuries, liver function damage, cardiac muscle damage, kidney damage, and coagulation function changes [7, 8]. Among these laboratory tests, elevated LDH is more common in children than in adults (p = 0.02). An elevated LDH is commonly seen in cardiopulmonary disease and inflammation. The elevated LDH suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be more likely to cause cardiopulmonary injury and inflammation in children, although lung inflammation in children is less severe than in adults. Of course, since the level of LDH is not high in children, it may not have practical clinical significance. Both CRP and IL-6 are major indicators of inflammation. An elevated level of CRP and IL-6 was shown in adults, but not in children, which suggests that inflammation caused by viral infection, especially in the lungs, is less severe in children than in adults. In addition, lung injuries are not uncommon in children and are characterized by bilateral involvement, which is similar to that of adults. However, lung injuries in adults were more severe compared with children (Fig. 1). Of the 14 children cases, 8 cases were asymptomatic cases. The age of asymptomatic patients was younger than that of symptomatic patients. The white blood cell and lymphocyte counts were more decreased in symptomatic children cases than that in asymptomatic children cases, which was due to a lower inflammatory response in asymptomatic children cases. Even among asymptomatic patients, 62.5% of cases had lung injuries. Therefore, lung injuries caused by SARS-CoV-2 is still relatively obvious. The CT findings may further provide the reason why elevated levels of CRP were shown in adults, but not in children and elevated levels of LDH are common in children. The spike-protein (S) of SARS-CoV that mediates entrance to human respiratory epithelial cells by interacting with cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the most important means of pathogenesis [19, 20]. The number of ACE2 receptors are significantly lower in children than in adults and more in the lungs than in other organs [20], which may be the primary reason why children have fewer clinical symptoms and organ dysfunction than adults and lung injuries even among asymptomatic children cases. In addition, the weak immune response triggered by viral infection because of children\u2019s weakened immune function maybe responsible for this state.",
