The magnitude of the peak increased from ages 1 to 7 years and declined from ages 7 to 18 years, from which it remained stable until age 50 years.

Rather, we concluded that the September peak has such highly predictable timing because it is related directly to the date of school return, and that the initial focus of the epidemic is in school-age children, most notably those at the beginning of their schooling. Viral infections, predominantly rhinovirus, have been shown to be associated with approximately 80% of asthma exacerbations in this age group.4 Rhinovirus infections are most common in early fall, and school-age children introduce rhinovirus infections into their families 3 times more frequently than working adults.5 Our observation that the September peak in school-age children occurs earlier in northern areas of Canada suggests that opportunities for transmission of infection may be greater, possibly because of increased contact on school buses or in closed classrooms.",
