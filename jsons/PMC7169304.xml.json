            "text": "During the last few years, emerging infectious diseases have captured the attention of the transfusion medicine community. Emerging diseases are broadly defined as those whose rates have increased in the last two decades [1]. From a blood safety perspective, current attention has largely focused on those recently emerged agents that may be transmitted by transfusion. In Europe, particularly the UK, measures have been implemented to address concerns regarding potential transmission of prions associated with variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (vCJD) [2, 3]. The recent emergence and continued spread of West Nile virus in the USA has led to the rapid implementation of nucleic acid testing (NAT) to reduce the incidence of transfusion transmission [4, 5]. Lastly, following the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), blood collection agencies and test manufacturers rapidly developed measures to address potential transmission of this coronavirus, but as yet these measures have fortunately not required implementation [6].",

Perhaps foremost among these agents are several species of Babesia known to cause human infections. The first case of human babesiosis, which was also fatal, was reported in 1957 from what was then known as Yugoslavia [7]. In 1966, the first US case was reported on Nantucket Island off the New England coast [8]. Since then, hundreds of cases of human babesiosis have been reported in the USA, and an additional 30 cases have been reported in Europe [9, 10, 11, 12]. The known geographical range of the parasite continues to expand owing to environmental and ecological changes, enhanced epidemiological investigations and an overall increase in public health awareness. From a blood safety perspective, transfusion\u2010transmitted infections involving Babesia spp. have become increasingly problematic in the USA, with progressively more reported each year [13]. However, despite epidemiological data suggesting that Babesia spp. are a growing blood safety concern, particularly in the USA, they continue to be overshadowed by other, often newly emerged, agents. This review will attempt to summarize not only why the Babesia spp. remain a neglected blood safety concern, but also why they should be considered as a priority for transfusion medicine.",

B. microti is predominately found in the northeastern and upper midwestern USA, but is also endemic in Europe [10, 14, 15]. Additionally, B. microti\u2010like agents have been identified recently in Europe, Japan and parts of Asia, suggesting a wider dissemination [16, 17, 18]. B. divergens is mainly limited to Europe [12], but three zoonotic cases in the USA have been attributed to B. divergens\u2010like organisms that bear nearly identical 18S ribosomal RNA gene sequences (similarity score: 99\u00b75\u201399\u00b78%) to the European parasite [19, 20]. However, the past decade has also seen the emergence of Babesia\u2010like agents, which have been implicated in human disease and at least two transfusion\u2010transmitted infections, but are phylogenetically distinct from B. microti and B. divergens[21, 22]. These agents, often designated by their geographical location, include CA\u20101 (California), WA\u20101 (Washington) and EU\u20101 (Austria and Italy) [23]. Other sporadic cases of human babesiosis have been reported from Egypt, South Africa and Mexico, but the aetiologic agents were not fully characterized [24, 25, 26]. Taken together, it seems likely that new agents and a broadened geographical distribution for Babesia spp. will continue to be reported.",

            "text": "Babesiosis is a zoonotic disease maintained in nature by a complex interaction of tick vectors, animal reservoirs and maintenance/transport hosts. Worldwide, the primary vectors for Babesia spp. are ticks of the genus Ixodes. In the USA, the black\u2010legged tick, I. scapularis (synonymous with I. dammini), serves as the primary vector for B. microti, while I. pacificus is thought to be the vector of WA\u20101. The European vector for B. microti is I. trianguliceps, but this tick does not feed on humans, perhaps explaining why few, if any, human cases of B. microti are reported in Europe [15]. The sheep tick, I. ricinus, has also been shown to be a competent vector for B. microti[27, 28], but this tick is primarily recognized as the European vector of B. divergens[10]. In each of these locations the implicated Ixodes tick vector for Babesia is the same vector that locally transmits Borrelia burgdorferi, the aetiological agent of Lyme disease. While the tick vector for the B. microti\u2010like agent in Japan has not been definitively identified, by analogy it has been described as I. persulcatus, which is the Japanese vector of Lyme borreliosis [17]. For each of these ticks, adult and nymphal stages are capable of transmitting the infection; however, in most instances the tick must feed for 48 h or longer to successfully transmit the parasite [29, 30].",

Also playing a critical role in the USA are white\u2010tailed deer, which, while not competent hosts for B. microti, do serve as transport hosts for adults of I. scapularis. The analogous reservoir host in Japan is probably the field mouse, Apodemus speciosus, which was first shown to be infected with B. microti\u2010like parasites over 20 years ago [31]. In contrast, throughout the distribution of B. divergens in Europe, cattle serve as the reservoir host for human infections, as well as the definitive host of the parasite.",

The tick vector deposits thousands of infective sporozoites in the dermis during the latter stages of feeding (i.e. after 48 h) [10]. Within the human host, sporozoites infect erythrocytes and become trophozoites that replicate by binary fission, producing the characteristic Maltese cross forms seen in some cases (e.g. WA\u20101) [32]. Replication, in turn, leads to cell rupture, lysis, and release of merozoites that infect additional erythrocytes. These replicate cycles can produce high levels of parasitemia and haemoglobinuria within the host.",

Characteristic symptoms include fever, headache, chills, drenching sweats, myalgia and malaise, but these usually abate within a few weeks. More severe disease complications (including haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, haematuria and renal failure) have been observed in infants, elderly, asplenic and immunocompromised patients.

In one study, parasitaemia was shown to persist for 18 months, based on positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results [35]. More recent studies have corroborated the presence of parasitaemia among blood donors with antibodies to B. microti, which in some cases persists for months [13, 36]. However, this latter study also demonstrated that some patients infected with B. microti produce long\u2010term elevated antibody titres in the absence of measurable parasitaemia. This suggests that some patients maintain chronic babesial infections that are below the limit of detection by PCR: parasites may only circulate in the peripheral blood at extremely low numbers, on an intermittent basis or they may be restricted to sequestered tissue or organ sites. Indeed, recrudescence of measurable parasitaemia among serologically positive patients has been reported in several instances, in the absence of obvious re\u2010exposure to infected vectors, thus possibly indicating underlying, silent infections [35, 36]. These observations support earlier contentions by Gorenflot et al., who suggested that immunocompetent, spleen\u2010intact people may act as asymptomatic carriers of babesiosis [37]. Alternatively, it has been suggested that chronic infections associated with Babesia spp. may be linked to the parasite's ability to undergo antigenic variation, which is expressed on the cell surface of the infected erythrocyte [38]. While antigenic variation has not been implicated as an evasion strategy for B. microti, this parasite's considerable allelic polymorphism may allow for frequent recombinant events leading to mixed infections, thereby allowing some parasites to evade recognition by the immune response.",

However, for most infections the parasitaemia levels fall well below the limits of visual detection. Detection by smear is also labour intensive, subjective in nature and easily misinterpreted owing to similarities with ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum. Direct detection can be enhanced by inoculating susceptible rodents, hamsters or mice for B. microti and by inoculating gerbils for B. divergens, with patient blood. Babesia spp. readily replicate in appropriate rodent hosts and thus the amplified infection can be identified in smears of rodent blood; however, these animals must be checked periodically over a 6\u20138\u2010week period, making this technique impractical for rapid diagnosis.",

The rapid onset of symptoms (e.g. haemoglobinuria) associated with B. divergens makes serological detection impractical in many patients, because the infection may prove fatal before detectable antibodies are present. The gold standard for serological detection of B. microti infection is the immunofluorescence assay (IFA), which uses infected rodent red cells as the antigen source. The presence of IgM is indicative of a recent or acute infection, but the failure to demonstrate IgG on a subsequent sample may suggest a false\u2010positive result [41, 43]. While IgM is present only during the acute phase of disease, IgG persists for months, sometimes years. Critical for successful identification of babesial infection is the use of appropriate antigen sources for each agent. For example, sera from a patient, in Washington State, with a recent B. divergens\u2010like infection did not react with B. microti or WA\u20101 antigens, but showed marked IFA reactivity to antigens of B. divergens[20]. More recently, enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\u2010based methods that use antigens derived from infected hamster cells or synthetic peptide antigens have been developed [44, 45].

PCR assays can thus be used to identify patients in the acute phase, as well as those who remain persistently or chronically infected [13, 35]. That said, PCR assays are limited somewhat by the initial sample volume, thus a negative PCR assay alone does not preclude the presence of an ongoing Babesia infection.",

While generally successful, drug\u2010related side\u2010effects, including tinnitus and gastroenteritis, occur frequently, and infections may persist, despite treatment. An alternative therapy (atovaquone and azithromycin), has been shown to be equally effective with reduced adverse consequences [48]. In those rare instances in which drug treatment is ineffective, high levels of parasitaemia persist, or signs of haemodynamic instability exist, an exchange transfusion may be prescribed [20, 49, 50]. Exchange transfusion for babesiosis, like that for malaria, is designed to rapidly reduce overall parasitaemia levels and related haemolysis.

Indeed, because B. microti remains regionalized, selective geographical testing has been suggested as a cost\u2010effective intervention [51]. Unfortunately, a regionalized approach is not only problematic from a manufacturer's perspective, but raises logistic issues for blood collection organizations. Perhaps the larger issue is how the transfusion medicine community can persuade assay manufacturers to develop tests for agents that may have limited markets. As economics clearly play a role, a simple solution to this problem is not readily available. Similarly, while NAT would be feasible and invaluable for identifying window\u2010period infections, the cost of developing an assay for what is perceived to be a limited market may likewise preclude its implementation.",

            "text": "While blood screening awaits the development of suitable tests, alternative approaches to managing potentially infectious donors have been proposed. One approach is to avoid blood collection in highly endemic areas during the periods of peak transmission (i.e. June to September) [51]. However, reports of persistent, year\u2010round infections in some blood donors suggest that selective blood collection would only partially reduce the risk of transmission, while negatively impacting local blood availability. Other approaches include leucoreduction, filtration and pathogen reduction, but each poses their own set of technical barriers. Leucoreduction would appear to be ill suited for Babesia spp. because the agent is intra\u2010erythrocytic. In contrast, filtration technology would need to differentiate between infected and non\u2010infected red cells. This approach, however, may have some merit as infected red cells will probably present different surface antigens from uninfected cells. Feasibility of pathogen\u2010reduction technology for reducing or inactivating Babesia spp. has already been demonstrated [68, 69]. Regrettably, host responses to pathogen\u2010reduction technologies, specifically involving red cells, have recently proven to be problematic, leading to the withdrawal of the system from the market. It remains to be seen if these technological hurdles can be overcome.",

Blood recipients at greatest risk for developing severe babesiosis (e.g. the elderly or asplenic individuals) would be transfused with units of blood identified as negative for Babesia spp. Indeed, most immunocompetent blood recipients tolerate Babesia infections with few complications, but the elderly and asplenic can develop severe, even life\u2010threatening, disease. This approach, however, is predicated on the availability of approved tests, which are currently not available.",

            "text": "Newly emergent agents continue to capture the attention of transfusion medicine, but other, long\u2010known agents, such as Babesia spp., pose ongoing and seemingly increasing threats to blood safety that perhaps have received inadequate attention. In part, the lack of attention may be caused by the parasite's limited geographical distribution and the mild, self\u2010limiting disease experienced by most patients. However, the distribution of Babesia spp. appears to be greater than originally thought, and the parasite is increasingly implicated in transfusion\u2010transmitted cases, particularly among patients who receive large amounts of blood and are highly susceptible to babesial infection (e.g. elderly, asplenic and immunocompromised). The lack of a consensus approach in preventing transmission of Babesia spp. remains problematic and may not be easily resolved in the absence of licensed blood screening tests. One of the greatest hurdles in addressing Babesia spp. is persuading manufacturers to develop approaches, particularly screening assays, for what is perceived to be a limited market. To overcome this obstacle, a concerted effort among government agencies, blood collection organizations and the public health community is needed to encourage the development of suitable interventions for Babesia spp. In summary, now that the Babesia spp. are clearly visible on our radar screen, appropriate interventions should be considered in order to reduce the blood safety risks posed by this agent.",
