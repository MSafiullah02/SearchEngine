            "text": "Cryptosporidiosis in calves, most commonly caused by the apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum, is an important cause of enteric disease in neonatal and pre-weaned calves under 6 weeks of age (Thomson et al., 2017). The parasite is the most commonly diagnosed pathogen found in diarrheic neonatal calves in both beef and dairy systems in the UK (www.gov.uk/government/collections/animal-disease-surveillance-reports) and in many other countries worldwide (Wang et al., 2017). Clinical signs include watery and sometimes bloody diarrhoea, nutrient malabsorption, dehydration and, in severe cases, mortality (Naciri et al., 1999). The economic impact of enteric disease has been estimated to cost in the region of GBP 32 per affected calf (Gunn and Stott, 1997) and approximately GBP 11 million annually in UK (Bennet and Ijpelaar, 2005), although no figures are currently available on the economic impact of Cryptosporidium specifically. The parasite is difficult to remove from the environment as the oocysts have a very tough outer shell, enabling the parasite to survive for long periods of time in the environment, withstand a wide range of temperatures (\u221222 \u00b0C to 60 \u00b0C) (Robertson et al., 1992), and resist the effects of many of the commonly used farm disinfectants (Casemore, 1990). The infectious dose for neonatal calves can be as low as 17 oocysts (Zambrinski et al., 2013), making it very difficult to control exposure to the parasite on the farm. The disease is normally self-limiting in neonatal calves where sufficient colostral antibodies have been absorbed, and animals are kept warm and dry with supportive treatments administered where required, and when there are no co-infections with other gastrointestinal pathogens (Thomson et al., 2017). Currently there are no vaccines available and only two licenced products for the prevention and treatment of cryptosporidiosis in calves in the UK (Grinberg et al., 2002, Innes et al., 2011, Trotz-Williams et al., 2011).",

Lambs positive for Cryptosporidium in faecal samples on at least one occasion over the study period had significantly reduced carcass weight and dressing percentage (Sweeny et al., 2011). A further study, also conducted on lambs, found that animals positive for Cryptosporidium were between 2.31 and 4.52 kg lighter over three sampling occasions at 12, 19 and 29 weeks of age and showed both a reduced carcass weight and dressing percentage (Jacobson et al., 2016).",

Very little is currently known about the extent to which calves with diarrheal disease recover and experience catch up growth with their healthy cohorts. A study in dairy calves in New York state, USA, did not find a significant effect on growth when calves that had experienced enteric disease were followed for a 3 month period (Virtala et al., 1996). A further study examining intestinal functions in calves following infection with C. parvum, found that all functions except retinyl-palmitate absorption were significantly reduced at day 14 p.i. (Klein et al., 2008). Infected calves showed reduced intestinal absorptive capacity and a high elevation of intestinal permeability with intestinal recovery observed by day 21 p.i. and infected calves showed a reduced growth rate over this period (Klein et al., 2008). A further study conducted in Brazil monitored calves infected with Cryptosporidium spp. from birth to 7 months of age and found an association of infection with lower live weight gain and poorer production performance (Bueno da Silva et al., 2019).",

This study was an observational study which took place during the spring calving of 2017 on a commercial beef suckler farm in Scotland, where there was a history of clinical cryptosporidiosis in neonatal calves. The calves were housed individually with their mother until at least 48 h of age and the calf had been visualised suckling. Afterwards, they were housed in group pens with their mothers. Group housed calves included both males and females ranging from 48 h to 3 months of age. At 3 months, adult cattle and their calves were moved to pasture. Preliminary visits and an interview with the farmer confirmed that calves commonly showed signs of cryptosporidiosis between 6\u201310 days old. These calves were naturally infected, thus the infectious dose was unknown. This farm had no historical veterinary diagnoses of other gastrointestinal pathogens (Rotavirus, coronavirus, Escherichia coli or Salmonella) in the calves, making it a suitable candidate to examine Cryptosporidium as the main cause of enteritis in a natural farm setting. Calf health was assessed by the farmer, who consulted vets when required. Severely affected calves were treated with HALOCUR\u00ae and rehydration therapy.",

The findings from this study indicate that severe clinical cryptosporidiosis at a young age significantly reduces the long-term growth rate, which concurs with some studies looking at the effect of diarrhoea (Pardon et al., 2013) and the short-term or longer term effect of cryptosporidiosis (Klein et al., 2008, Da Silva et al., 2019) on growth rate in calves. The current study relates cryptosporidiosis to economic losses and is one of the first papers to describe the long-term effects of cryptosporidiosis on calf growth. Cryptosporidium infection has a direct impact on growth rates in calves during the acute infection, as shown by Klein et al. (2008) but this paper monitored the calves for only 28 days and therefore did not determine whether there was any long-term weight reduction in calves due to the infection. The study described here clearly shows that the weight lost during the acute infection in neonatal calves is not regained during the subsequent 6 months, indicating that cryptosporidiosis may have a much more significant economic impact to the cattle industry than was previously thought. To date only one other study (Bueno da Silva et al., 2019) has reported long-term growth effects due to cryptosporidiosis in neonatal calves, therefore the data presented in the current study is highly significant. There are also key differences in the study designs between the two long-term growth studies, which are important to highlight. The study reported by Bueno da Silva et al. (2019) was carried out in Brazil on an experimental farm, using a more subjective method of condition scoring to determine the effect of cryptosporidiosis on calf growth. The current study is, to our knowledge, the first one to measure long-term growth effects on a beef suckler commercial farm in Scotland and measured calf growth by weight from birth to 6 months of age. This therefore provides an objective data set, enabling economic analysis of disease impact. In this paper, a scoring system of taking an average of the worst score, the preceding and following score was used, which was more accurate than an average score of 16 days where many of the initial and final scores would have been likely to total zero. This method ensured exclusion of milk scour, which neonatal calves may have in a single bout of diarrhoea, confirming the focus was on more significant clinical disease. This method therefore captured the severity of the disease by including only the disease timeframe (G. Innocent, BiOSS, Personal Communication). In addition, Bueno da Silva et al. (2019) used microscopy to determine oocyst concentration, whereas the current study used 18S nested species-specific PCR (Thomson et al., 2016), allowing speciation of Cryptosporidium and determination that the oocysts present were C. parvum.",

This particular study did not identify Cryptosporidium as the main cause of the diarrhoea, so it could be that it was not the main causative agent. Although the current study focused on a single farm, there were several advantages to this. This farm practised good biosecurity and attention to detail regarding calf health. Climatic regional patterns meant that the farm calved indoors in the spring and retained cows and calves inside until weather and grass availability allowed turnout, usually 3 months post-calving. The long period of time that the cattle spent indoors meant that the farm had a history of problems with cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidium was identified as being the sole diagnosed cause of the diarrhoea observed in the calves. Gastro-intestinal pathogens such as Rotavirus and Coronavirus are considered to be widespread in calves (Cho and Yoon, 2014), however in the study presented here none of the calves tested positive for Rotavirus, Coronavirus or E. coli F5 (K99). As the calves were on a single farm, a similar grazing and management scheme was followed for all groups, giving confidence that the weight effect seen was due to the initial Cryptosporidium infection.",

Therefore an average difference of 34 kg in animal weight at 6 months of age means an animal with severe cryptosporidiosis as a neonate, could result in an average loss of approximately GBP 128.18 per animal to the farmer in direct sales. There are also the potential increased costs in extra feeding and husbandry of animals that have been affected by clinical cryptosporidiosis to get them to their market weight. Although no treatment intervention costs were applied in this study, there are likely to be additional costs to farmers in dealing with severe cryptosporidiosis including veterinary costs, diagnostics and the purchase and application of licenced therapeutics.",

This predominant genotype present in all the calves in this study shows that this was the consistent Cryptosporidium challenge on this farm and that the differences in the clinical severity observed in the calves in the study may reflect differences in calf resilience and immunity, or reflect the different doses of parasite that the calves were exposed to. The infectious dose that each calf received was unknown as calves were studied in a natural farm setting. It is known that clinically affected calves can shed very high numbers (1 \u00d7 1010) of infectious Cryptosporidium oocysts in their faeces (Nydam et al., 2001) and further experimental studies have shown that it only requires 17 oocysts to cause clinical infection in neonatal calves (Zambrinski et al., 2013). The use of individual pens for calving on beef farms could lead to a build-up of Cryptosporidium oocysts and other pathogens which are shed by cows and their calves over the duration of the calving season, thereby exposing calves born later in the season to a higher infectious dose. This higher infectious dose would increase the likelihood of the calf developing diarrhoea (Blanchard, 2012). In Sweden it has been found that there is no association between C. parvum shedding and diarrhoea in calves and therefore there are more factors at play which affect severity of disease rather than oocyst shedding alone (Silverlas et al., 2010). Calf housing, frequency of cleaning and disinfectant used all have an effect on the prevalence of Cryptosporidium on farm (Castro-Hermida et al., 2002) however as this study was done on one farm with a single management regime, these are not the likely reason for the differences in severity of cryptosporidiosis.",

On average, a calf with severe disease weighed 34 kg less than a calf which showed no clinical signs of cryptosporidiosis. The direct losses associated with this reduced weight gain related to sales is approximately GBP 130 per affected calf, however further costs such as increased feed and husbandry costs to get cattle to their market weights, additional labour involved in looking after sick calves, together with veterinary and treatment costs, make cryptosporidiosis a significant economic burden to the cattle industry. Management strategies to help reduce the impact of cryptosporidiosis should be applied to improve the health and welfare of cattle, increase production efficiency and reduce contamination of the farm environment with infectious Cryptosporidium oocysts.",
