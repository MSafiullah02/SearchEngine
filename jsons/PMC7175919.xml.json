            "text": "Recent outbreak of the COVID-19 first detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has caused concern as it rapidly expanded in China and elsewhere. The World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency associated with the COVID-19 on Jan 30, 2020 and subsequently declared it being a pandemic on Mar 12, 2020 due to global spread. Within 3-1/2 months since outbreak in December 2019, over 1.3 million people have been infected over 206 countries in the world with over 70,000 deaths. These infection and death rates keep rising. The virus is likely to start from animals like camels, cattle, and bats [1]. Based on the infection cases in China as well as outside China, there were evidences that this new coronavirus has spread from animal-to-person, and from person-to-person similar to SARS and MERS coronavirus that happened in 2003 and 2012, respectively, according to the Centers for Control Disease and Prevention (CDC) [1], [2]. Despite the person-to-person spread is not fully understood, it is thought to occur mainly through respiratory and mouth droplets produced by sneezing and coughing of the infected person [1]. The droplets can be larger than 5 \u03bcm, and it can also be less than 5 \u03bcm [3], [4], which is referred as nuclei droplet [5]. This does not exclude also the possibility of the virus being attached to fine particles in the respiratory track or mouth of the infected person and got aerosolized during coughing, sneezing, speech and vomiting [6]. The aerosolization of virus may be one of the several causes that explains the sustained person-to-person spread of the COVID-19 in the world in such a short period of time. Interestingly, other than practicing social distancing and washing hands to keep disinfected, people wearing facemasks and respirators in the Far East, a deep rooted tradition, seem to have better control on the spread of COVID-19 as compared to the West where facemasks and respirators are less commonly used. The global infection statistics in the past 3-1/2 months support strongly the essence of good filtration technology as a first-line defence to the spread of the airborne virus.",

This is similar in size as the SARS coronavirus, which is also 100nm. The common influenza virus is 80-120nm, which average out to 100nm. As the virus can be attached to particulates less than 100nm, the smallest size for the COVID-19 and its carrier (droplet or particle) can still be about 100nm. Can our current filtration technology provide adequate protection filtering out the airborne 100nm aerosol? The 100nm aerosol has been referred to as nano-aerosol, nanoparticle or ultrafine particle. While the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has standardized N95 and N98 respirator at 300nm, there is no standard filtration test for nano-aerosols at 100nm. The objective of the present study is to fill in this unmet need by developing effective new filtration technology target on this nano-aerosol size (i.e. 100nm) that represents the average size of COVID-19, as well as any other viruses including common cold/flu viruses, SARS and MERS.",

While a lot of attention has been on PM2.5, which is based on the standard set by the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of 25\u03bcm/m3 of air. There is less attention drawn to the finer aerosols, in particularly the PM1 (<1\u03bc) and PM0.1(<0.1\u03bcm). For sub-micron aerosol PM1, the aerosols concentration should be measured by number concentration and they contribute very little to the PM2.5, which is based on the mass concentration. This applies more to the PM0.1, which is even smaller. Despite this, the high concentration of PM1 and more so the PM0.1 can penetrate deeply in our body [8]. Indeed, it has been reported nano-aerosols of 41nm were found in the erythrocyte in the capillary lumen and 81 nm particle in the cytoplasm of a capillary endothelial cell in the lung [9]. In fact, when nano-aerosols enter the blood stream they can be transported to various organs, including to our central nervous system and even having adverse effect on our brain [8]. Indeed, nano-aerosols are also present in large number concentrations, about 200 million per cubic meter, from road emission [10]. The target of protecting 100nm COVID-19 is also applicable for protecting wearer of face mask against 100nm aerosol pollutant from combustion emission (traffic, power plant, industries) as the number concentration around this size is extremely high, 200 million/m3\n[10].",

As an example, for filtration in a facemask, only small amounts of nanofibers are required, on the order of less than 1 gram of fiber per square meter (gsm) filter area. This is much smaller than 20-40 gsm being used for facemasks with microfibers of diameter 2 \u2013 20 \u03bcm. However, the pressure drop can be significant for nanofiber filters as the theoretical pressure drop \u0394p \u221d 1/df\n2 according to the Davis\u2019 equation [13] established experimentally for microfibers. If this holds, then it is expected the pressure drop is at least 100X more for nanofibers with the same basis weight (i.e. gsm). Other than the large specific surface of nanofibers that lead to high pressure drop, another factor leading to pressure drop is the smaller pores (on the order several micrometers or less depending on the gsm of the nanofibers) of the nanofiber mat versus the larger pores (tens of micrometers) for the microfiber mat.",

            "text": "Another approach to improve the filter efficiency without incurring pressure drop is to charge the nanofibers so that the nanofibers carry electrostatic charges. There have been various attempts to charge the nanofibers in the past [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], but in most of the situations the charges decay within a day and the stability of the charges implanted in the nanofiber becomes the biggest challenge. Recently, we have been able to charge the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber mat using corona discharge [21], [22]. The electrostatic charges can stay for 3 months with only 1% reduction in filtration efficiency, which is extremely promising. This is due to using corona discharge charging the nanofibers by implanting more stable space charges in the nanofiber mat. In that study, comparison was made on the single fiber efficiency based on the nanofiber filter with microfiber filters having fiber diameter 10-20\u03bcm. It was found that the single-fiber efficiency due to the charged nanofiber is much more superior. Unfortunately, in the study the average fiber diameter was held fixed at 450nm [21]. It is expected that a stronger electric field can greatly affect dielectrophoresis, i.e. first inducing dipoles on approaching neutrally charged aerosols and subsequently attracting the charged aerosol by the charged fiber by interacting with the opposite charge of the dipole on the particle. This leads to an interesting issue that if the fiber diameter is made smaller, would the charged fiber in the nanofiber mat more superior having stronger electric field (given E\u221d1/R\n2 where E is the electric field and R is the distance from the axis of the fiber to the particle)? On the other hand, as the fiber diameter is being reduced, pressure drop also increases. If the pressure drop indeed follows inversely to the quadratic power of the fiber diameter in accordance to Davis\u2019 equation, one may be limited in reducing the nanofiber diameter. Perhaps, there may be an optimum for which the fiber diameter is sufficiently small providing strong enough electric field to effect dielectrophoresis, yet the pressure drop is still acceptable. This objective will be incorporated in our investigation.",

They have been demonstrated to be superior as compared to the current microfiber technology which are the predominant filtration media of facemask and respirators. Previous study [21] on use of multilayer PVDF nanofibers focused only on one fiber diameter 450nm using a fixed basis weight of 0.87gsm of fibers. However, other fiber diameters and other fiber basis weight have not been investigated. It is possible that with small fiber diameter it requires much less fibers in the filter providing savings on materials. Also, it is thought that small fiber diameter, say 100nm, can provide a large specific surface (surface-to-volume); as such, it can sustain stronger electric field and provide effective capture of neutral aerosols by dielectrophoresis. Further, small diameter nanofiber when used in air filtration can enhance diffusion for capturing of small aerosols less than 0.1 \u03bcm and interception for capturing of larger aerosols between 0.1 and 1 \u03bcm. Unfortunately, the downside of this approach is that small-diameter nanofiber can induce much higher flow resistance and thus pressure drop due to the increased specific area of fiber surface. As such, there might be a balance among these competing effects. Further, the basis weight for the module in the multilayering is also a critical design parameter. Should one use large basis weight close to 1 gram per square meter (gsm) or small basis weight less than 0.1 gsm in each module/layer? This additional parameter may also be tied closely with the fiber diameter rather than being independent. All these issues need to be investigated with the current study, which is largely experimental.",

The modules were stacked up in multiples to form a filter with increasing amounts of nanofibers to increase the capture of 100nm aerosols until the 90% filtration efficiency target is reached. Obviously, the pressure drop across the filter, \u0394p, also increased, and this needed to be less than the set 30Pa limit.

The precursor solution was fed to a syringe connected to a high voltage supply of 20,000 V. The ground collector was placed at 15 cm from the syringe tip. A control amount of PVDF solution (0.9mL/h) was delivered by the syringe using the syringe pump to form a little droplet at the syringe tip. Under the strong electrostatic field, the droplet took on the shape of a cone. Once the electrostatic force acting on the cone-shape droplet overcame the surface tension force acting on the droplet, a jet was sent out through the cone-shape droplet. During free flight, the jet continued to thin out in diameter as the solvent was evaporated continuously and the \u2018positive\u2019 electrical charges deposited along the jet repelled against each other thereby further stretching out the fiber jet. By the time when the fiber jet landed onto the substrate laid over the collector surface, the fiber diameter reduced to the diameter corresponding to a nanofiber (<1\u03bcm). To get a uniform mat, a rotating collector was used with rotation speed of 10 rev/min. The humidity during electrospinning was controlled at 40\u00b12%. The electrospinning process is depicted in Fig. 1a\n. The precursor solution with different amounts of PVDF were electrospun to nanofibers of different diameters. The typical range was 20% g of solute in 100 mL of solution (20 %w/v). When more PVDF were used in the precursor solution larger diameter nanofiber resulted, and vice versa. If the concentration was too high, beads could form together with the nanofibers. If the concentration was too low, not only the fiber diameter could be reduced but fibers broke up easily as well. After optimizing, good PVDF nanofibers were produced for four different diameter sizes, 84, 191, 349 and 525nm. The nanofiber mat was dried in an oven overnight at 40\u00b0C for curing where residual solvent was evaporated. To get different basis weight, the time for electrospinning was adjusted.",

Among the three mechanisms at work in capturing aerosols for the electret nanofiber filter (top 4 curves in Fig. 3a), diffusion, interception and electrostatic capture, the electrostatic mechanism seemed to dominate over the two mechanical capture mechanisms, with exception for the smaller aerosols wherein the electrostatic mechanism is weak while diffusion is strong. The large specific surface for the small diameter 84nm nanofiber can acquire higher density of electric charges on the nanofibers by corona discharge. In turn, the high electric field from the small nanofibers induced a strong dipole moment to the challenging neutrally charged aerosol as it came close to the charged nanofibers. Subsequently, electrostatic attraction between the charged fiber and the opposite charge of the dipole on the aerosol resulted in capture of the aerosol by the fiber. These two steps, known as dielectrophoretic interaction, when added to the mechanical diffusion and interception provided \u2018electret\u2019 nanofiber filter more superb filtration capability than uncharged \u2018mechanical\u2019 nanofiber filter with only diffusion and interception.",

Thus, the difference between these two curves with the same fiber diameter represents only the electrostatic capture for a given aerosol size. Electrostatic effect contributed much higher efficiency. This is in as much as 30% absolute and 100% on relative basis for a given fiber diameter. For example, for the 100nm aerosol challenging the filter, mechanical capture (diffusion and interception) for the 84nm fiber filter delivered about less than 30% filtration efficiency, while the added electret effect gave another additional 30+%. Thus, electrostatic capture can contribute 100% increase on an otherwise mechanical capture. For the 525nm fiber, the mechanical capture provided approximately slightly less than 11% filtration efficiency, while the combined mechanical and electrostatic mechanisms 40%, thus the relative increase due to electrostatic mechanism was 263%. (Note the low efficiency of 11% was due to the small amounts of nanofibers in the test filter.) Despite of the significant increase in filtration efficiency due to electrostatic mechanism, especially for large fiber diameter, there was no additional pressure drop for the filter. This is obviously the key advantage with electret filter media, especially for the nanofiber-based filter, in which intensified electrostatic field can be set up due to the small fiber diameter as electric field on the charged particle is inversely related to the quadratic power of distance separating the fiber from the particle.",

For the 84nm, the mechanical capture was on a par with that of the electrical. In fact, the smaller the fiber diameter say <100nm the stronger is the diffusion and interception. Interesting, the electrical effect increased to a maximum at the smallest diameter of 84nm. The increased in rate is not as rapidly as expected, see \u03b7Fe\u223c1/df\n0.192. This might be related to the small-diameter PVDF nanofibers which can acquire charges by induction by corona discharge, but it can equally dissipate charges to the environment when the charge density on the fiber became too high. Whatever charges the fiber can ultimately acquire from corona discharge was the equilibrium maximum charges that could be placed on the fibers balancing induction and dissipation of charges. There might be a fiber diameter at which the most charges can be induced. Indeed, the smallest diameter 84nm fiber had a slightly higher electrostatic capture in Fig. 3b. Including diffusion and interception together with the electrostatic, small fiber diameter still won out of the race as can be seen in the total capture (top curve).

As the basis weight of nanofibers increased, the pores between nanofibers further reduced leading to higher pressure drop. In addition, the increasing charged nanofibers in the mat interfered with each other affecting the electrostatic capture of neutrally charged aerosols. On the other hand, by rearranging nanofibers into multiple modules (multi-modules), or multiple layers (in short multilayers), in the filter, macropores of the scrim material were introduced into the filter disrupting an otherwise two-dimensional nanofiber mat dominated by micropores. This increased the thickness of the filter, which was of no consequence, yet this significantly reduced the pressure drop. Further, by rearranging the thick nanofiber mat into multilayers with each layer (referred \u2018L\u2019 in short) supported by a scrim porous material, the latter also served as a barrier to reduce the electrical interference between adjacent nanofiber layers in the filter on challenging aerosols, thereby improving capture of nano-aerosols by electrostatic effect.",

In Fig. 3c, the filtration efficiency versus aerosol size was compared with nanofibers in a single layer (1L) versus distributing the same basis weight of nanofibers redistributed in multiple layers (multilayers) such as 2L (two layers), 3L (three layers), 4L (four layers), respectively, with each layer separated by a permeable scrim/support material. In general, filtration efficiency increased with increasing basis weight as there were more fibers to capture aerosols in either single layer or multilayer configuration. However, the behaviour differed between the two configurations. As much as 7-10% efficiency difference can be seen for some aerosol sizes between single versus multilayer arrangement. For example, for the coronavirus nano-aerosol 100nm, the 1L charged filter with 0.77gsm has 87.4% efficiency, whereas the 4L charged filter with the same basis weight has 92.2%, representing 5% increase. Whereas for the 300nm, the 1L charged filter with 0.77gsm has 89.7% efficiency, whereas 4L charged filter with the same basis weight has 96.5%, representing an 8% increase. For each curve, the pressure drop, \u0394p (Pa), was tagged next to the curve. The \u0394p was attributed from nanofiber and substrate layer, and the bracket value indicated the contribution just due to the nanofibers alone as the pressure drop due to a single layer of substrate was 1.8Pa at 5.3 cm/s. For example, for the 4L nanofiber filter (total 0.77gsm), the 4 layers of nanofibers each laid on their separate substrates had a pressure drop of 39.5Pa, whereas the nanofibers alone without substrate was 32.3Pa (=39.5-4x1.8). The contribution from the substrate was small in comparison to that from the nanofibers. For the case of single-layer nanofiber filter with the same 0.77 gsm, the pressure drop was very high at 78.7 Pa. In other words, the nanofibers contribution to the single layer alone was 76.9 Pa (=78.7-1.8), which was 2.4X that of the multilayer filter.",

This is a two-dimensional space of efficiency versus pressure drop. Given the basis weight can also change with different filters, the optimization took place in a three-dimensional domain of efficiency versus pressure drop and fiber basis weight as shown in Fig. 4\n. The efficiency axis referred to the capture (benefit) of our target size 100nm (Coronavirus) and the two lateral axes were the pressure drop (operating cost) and the fiber basis weight (capital cost), respectively. For the basis weight axis, we have imposed the maximum amounts of fibers per square meter of filter area, say, 1 gsm, 3 gsm, 5 gsm and 7 gsm for the filters. The domain for achieving the target efficiency (>90%) for 100nm within a given maximum fiber basis weight (1, 3, 5, 7 gsm) and maximum pressure drop (30 Pa) was delineated in Fig. 4. In the following, we will limit our analysis to the two-dimensional space for a fixed maximum basis weight of the filter. All the results with various basis weight can be projected as a curve onto the \u03b7-\u0394p plot and the basis weight is used as a parameter on the curve (by number of layers in the multilayer filter). When different fiber diameters were considered, the fiber diameter also entered as a separate parameter for the curve in the plot.",

The higher was QF, the more cost effective was the test filter. Indeed, 191nm (0.191gsm) and 525nm (0.191gsm) both followed the QF=0.025Pa-1. The filters with respectively 84nm (0.191gsm) and 349nm (0.096gsm) followed closely the QF curve for 0.03Pa-1. The filter with 349nm (0.191gsm) followed in between the QF curves 0.025 and 0.03 Pa-1. Finally, the filter with 525nm (0.765gsm) was slightly below the curve for QF=0.035Pa-1.

Summarizing, all 6 sets of curves under multilayering arrangement followed the constant benefit-to-cost QF=0.03\u00b10.005Pa-1 curve. This made prediction on the efficiency and pressure drop simple and easy. Increasing the filter efficiency by stacking more modules to increase the basis weight of fibers incurred the same pressure drop at the same pace with efficiency, which was quite remarkable with multilayering or multi-modules for the filter.",

On the other hand, as the module basis weight was reduced by half, the number of modules were doubled in order to have the same basis weight. This is shown in Fig. 8\n. Interestingly, the efficiency curve of the multilayer filters with increasing number of modules increased along the iso-QF curve of 0.14 Pa-1 but eventually it ended by dropping back to 0.1Pa-1. Despite this, the performance curve was still higher than the original with module basis weight of 0.191gsm, yet the basis weight of nanofibers was the same with ultimately 0.768gsm (4X0.191\u22488X0.096). This is shown in Fig. 8. It seems that the electrical interference caused lower efficiency and higher pressure drop. By reducing the module basis weight, and increasing the electrical barriers from the scrim material, the charge interference between adjacent layers was reduced, and the performance curve followed more closely the iso-QF curve.

The basis weight was increased to 4L with 3.06 gsm total to improve efficiency and QF dropped to 0.13 Pa-1 (\u03b7=90%, \u0394p=18Pa). On the other hand, if all nanofibers were placed in a single layer, it started at 0.765gsm with QF=0.16Pa-1 and after increasing basis weight to 3.06gsm, QF dropped to a value below 0.07 Pa-1 (\u03b7=76%, \u0394p=22Pa). In fact, as shown in Fig. 11a, 2L(0.765gsm) had efficiency of 74% which was higher than the same basis weight single-layer filter having 65% efficiency and the same \u0394p. Likewise, 3L(0.765gsm) had efficiency of 85% which was higher than the same basis weight single-layer filter with 70% and the same \u0394p. This clearly pointed to the advantage of multilayering or multi-modules having higher efficiency of capturing 100nm aerosol due to reduced electrical interference between layers or modules and providing open pores by the support layers inter-dispersed between the nanofiber layers for reducing flow resistance.",

Incoming air passed from one filter layer to the next despite the filter layers were all packed compactly together. That is, the entrance and exit effect of fluid flow for a given filter layer was minimized. On the other hand, the charged multilayer filter followed somewhat the iso-QF curve, QF=0.14-1, for 2L, 3L, and 4L. However, there was a noticeable drop in QF at the 6L from the initial 0.14Pa-1 to a lower value of 0.11Pa-1. Given the stack-up of multilayer did not quite follow exactly the iso-QF behaviour, the filter layers were not completely independent. The deviation from the iso-QE was not because of fluid flow effect between layers but due to the electrical interference of the different layers on each other and on the challenging aerosols. Despite this, the deviation only occurred for the 6th layer and it was not substantial. For 4L (0.765gsm) filter with 525-nm fiber diameter with total basis weight of 3.06gsm, charged filter provided 90% capture while uncharged filter has only half of the efficiency!

Suppose the virus was attached to a larger particle and the overall equivalent size became 300-nm during airborne, the filtration efficiency has been determined. Fig. 12\nshowed the efficiency versus pressure drop for the 7 filters with challenging aerosol of size of 300nm simulating this situation. Several important points were noted:a)QF for charged filters ranged between 0.1 and 0.15Pa-1. The 84-nm diameter followed the QF=0.1 Pa-1. Both 525nm and 450nm diameter filters were higher performance filters with superior filtration for different modules stack-up. Their \u03b7-\u0394p behaviour followed closely the constant QF of 0.15 Pa-1. Also, the 349nm with a smaller basis weight module 0.096gsm also followed QF=0.15 Pa-1 except that the last data started dropping to a lower QF of 0.13Pa-1. This was most likely related to the 8 modules stack-up each having a scrim support, which also contributed to the \u0394p. (The scrim material had a pressure drop of 1.2Pa.) For reference the higher performance QF curves for 0.2 Pa-1and 0.3 Pa-1 were also included in Fig. 12.b)The performance ranking for the 7 filters for the 300nm aerosol had not changed as compared to that of 100nm. The performance was even better, which was typical characteristics of charged filter with efficiency being higher for larger aerosol size. This was due to induction of stronger dipole moment for the larger aerosol, which resulted in better capture.c)All filters had pressure drop less than 30Pa (3.1mm water).d)Several filters achieved over 90% efficiency.e)4L(0.765gsm) achieved 95% with low pressure drop of only 18Pa. This fulfilled the N95 requirement but with pressure drop a lot lower!f)6L(0.765gsm) achieved 98% with 26Pa pressure drop. This fulfilled the N98 requirement but with pressure drop much reduced!\n",

The 3L showed good comparison between prediction and test results with exception that there were some small deviations of prediction from test results for Dp<300nm. This deviation became progressively increased with 4L and 6L. This had to do with the electrical interference which affected more on the smaller size aerosols while the larger aerosols (> 200nm) with larger induced dipole moments were less being affected, especially with the scrim materials which served as the electrical barriers or isolators.",

For large fiber diameter (525nm), large basis weight for each module and lesser modules in the stack-up filter should be used in the stack-up filter to achieve the target efficiency for the 100nm aerosols.

By stacking up modules with finer diameter nanofibers (349nm) and smaller basis weight in the module (0.096gsm) or by using coarser less fibers (525nm) reducing pressure drop but compensating using larger basis weight (0.765gsm), we reached the set efficiency goal within the pressure drop limit of 30Pa. Two filters with low basis weight of less than 1gsm fibers, 3L(0.191gsm, 84nm fiber) with total 0.57gsm and 8L(0.096gsm, 349nm fiber) with total 0.77gsm can indeed meet the 90% efficiency target for 100nm aerosol with pressure drop less than 30Pa.
