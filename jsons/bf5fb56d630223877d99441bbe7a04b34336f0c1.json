The annual period of mass migration for the Spring festival holidays (chunyun) was also fast approaching. To mitigate the spend of COVID-19, the Chinese government implemented unprecedented intervention strategies. The authorities sealed off Wuhan city and several nearby cities on the morning of 23 January 2020 (09:00 am Beijing time). Millions of people were required to stay home until further notice. More than 40,000 medical staff, including doctors and nurses, and countless medical supplies were sent to Hubei province from other provinces/regions of the country. Moreover, the government decided to extend the national holiday, adopt strict measures to limit travel and public gatherings, close all public places of entertainment and implement rigorous temperature monitoring nationwide. 4 Although there were several criticisms declaring that China was overreacting to the outbreak, these measures had a significant impact on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, we want to share the experiences and lessons learned from Wuhan and thus provide effective policy suggestions for other countries. Fig.1 illustrates our modified SEIR model. We assume that all people who 'move-in' to Wuhan are susceptible (S in ) 7 . However, we suppose that people who 'move-out' from Wuhan include both the susceptible (S out ) and the exposed (E out ). We further assume that the exposed people are asymptomatic but infectious. 1 Therefore, we have two propagation coefficients between the compartments S and E. We assume all infected individuals seeking treatment are hospitalised based on the availability of space in the hospitals (I h ). We suppose that the hospitalised people are quarantined and cannot infect people outside the hospital again. We also assume that individuals who are not hospitalised (I o ) will remain in the community and spread the disease further. 8 Finally, the removed individuals include two components, the recovered people (R r ) and the death cases (R d ). The detail of our modified SEIR model is shown in the online supplementary file material 9,10,11 . ",

The paired-t-test results in Table 2 prove that our model provides statistically similar results with respect to the outbreak data for the time period.

People were isolated in their homes, thus reducing exposure to the environment and contact with others. All public places of entertainment, such as restaurants, bars and cinemas, were closed in order to limit public gatherings. The second intervention measure was to provide enough medical resources, including doctors, nurses, drugs, masks, protective clothing, ventilators, and sufficient isolated rooms and beds. The third intervention was the combination of interventions 1 and 2 (i.e. sealing off the city and providing enough medical support, simultaneously). Finally, the fourth scenario was an assumption that the authorities did nothing to control the epidemic. Results are presented in Fig.4 . However, if the Chinese government did not seal off Wuhan city but simply provide enough medical support, the situation would be a little better. It can be seen that the peak time of the epidemic would also be delayed to May and the maximum number of cases would reach approximately 170,000. This finding may be important for some developed countries, such as Germany and Japan, who have abundant medical resources, but they may still pay a heavy price for the epidemic spread.",

This predicted result is quite consistent with the real situation that was seen in Wuhan. Similarly, we consider that the combined interventions in Wuhan bring great inspiration to South Korea. The COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea also grew rapidly at the beginning; however, after implementing a similar combined measure, the growth trend was well controlled. Finally, if no interventions were implemented, the results show that the peak period of the epidemic would be at the end of April. In such a scenario, millions of people would be infected with COVID-19 and the maximum number of cases could be more than 850,000 in Wuhan. Think about that, no city in any country has such a strong medical capacity to deal with such a serious situation. Due to incorrect responses at the initial stage, unfortunately, we estimate that England will be another epicentre in future weeks. In order to effectively control the spread of the epidemic, it is important to find out where these exposed population who left Wuhan have gone.

It is also important to identify and treat patients in the early stages of COVID-19 as much as possible and not let them return home until completely recovered. Obviously, this will lead to a surge in demand for the isolated beds. Fang Cang shelter hospitals were quickly constructed by reforming some large gyms; thus, the imbalance between supply and demand can be alleviated. the epidemic will continuously spread and finally the area that initially did well will be infected again.

The results also warn that not a single one of these two measures can be omitted.(2) It is very important for susceptible people to protect themselves. Washing hands frequently can effectively reduce the infection rate. In addition, people in some areas should change their traditional concepts about wearing masks. Patients and healthy people should all wear masks to prevent infection by infected persons, because droplet transmission, caused by sneezing, is one of the main ways for COVID-19 to spread.",
