            "text": "Chikungunya virus (genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae) is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes (Porterfield, 1980, Strauss and Strauss, 1986) and is typically responsible in human of an acute illness, which includes fever, maculopapular rash, and incapacitating arthralgia (Robinson, 1955, Johnston and Peters, 1996, Jupp and Cornel, 1988). Isolated for the first time during a Tanzanian outbreak in 1952 (Ross, 1956), CHIKV is geographically distributed in Africa, India, and Southeast Asia (Lam et al., 2001, Pastorino et al., 2004, Saluzzo et al., 1983). In Africa, until 2000, it was described as endemic through a sylvatic cycle involving wild primates, humans and mosquitoes of the genus Aedes (Powers et al., 2000). However, during the last 6 years, large urban outbreaks have been also reported in central Africa (Pastorino et al., 2004). Due to recent extension around the Indian Ocean, including Comoros, Mauritius, Reunion island, Madagascar and India (Bessaud et al., 2006b, Charrel et al., 2007, Schuffenecker et al., 2006, Ravi, 2006), and now in Italia, CHIKV is regarded as a potential worldwide public health problem, with no preventive or therapeutic means available.",

The genome of alphaviruses is a single RNA molecule of positive polarity, about 11.5 kb in length, encoding four non-structural proteins (nsP1-4) that are the essential components of the viral replicase and transcriptase. Functional proteins are first expressed as a polyprotein that is then cleaved by the viral proteases.",

Nucleoside triphosphatase, helicase, and RNA-dependent 5\u2032-triphosphatase activities are located in the N-terminus of the protein while the proteolytic domain has been mapped to its C-terminal part. It forms a papain-like thiol protease with a catalytic dyad involving two conserved residues C and H. The nsP2 protease is responsible for cleavages in the non-structural polyprotein (Kim et al., 2004, Vasiljeva et al., 2003) that are crucial for the viral replication cycle. Therefore, this protease constitutes an attractive target for the development of antiviral compounds.",

Such short substrates are useful to assay the catalytic activity of proteases and to map their specificity at non-prime sites. Residues in the P4-P3-P2-P1 positions (according to Schechter & Berger's nomenclature, 1967) are thought to be important for nsP2 cleavage as the enzyme can only recognize substrates with small residues in these positions and specifically a G in the P2 site (Lulla et al., 2006). Taking into account these data, we designed two synthetic peptides, Boc-AGA-MCA and Boc-AGG-MCA (JPT Peptide Technologies, Berlin, Germany), which represent the natural non-prime part of the CHIKV nsP1/nsP2 and nsP3/nsP4 cleavage sites, respectively.",

This result confirmed the functional importance of the nsP2 C-terminal region for its protease activity and the absence of protease contaminating activity in the recombinant protein preparation. Previous studies had shown that SFV nsP2 protease activity was inhibited by deletion in the 200 carboxyl-terminal domain (Vasiljeva et al., 2001). Recently, the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) nsP2 protease structure has been resolved (Russo and Watowich, 2006) and provided evidence that the C-terminal moiety may contribute to substrate recognition. Thus, the C-terminal region of alphavirus nsP2pro could fill a role similar to the NS2B cofactor of the flavivirus-encoded NS3 protease (Aleshin et al., 2007).",

The 3/4 site is rapidly cleaved during infection, and this cleavage is absolutely essential for virus replication and virus-specific RNA synthesis (Kim et al., 2004, Lemm et al., 1994).

As expected, the enzyme was completely resistant to the inhibitors of serine proteases (AEBSF, aprotinin), aspartic proteases (pepstatin), metalloproteases (EDTA). It was also resistant to one cysteine protease inhibitor (leupeptin). However, cleavage of the Boc-AGG-MCA substrate was completely inhibited by 25 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and by 2 mM of divalent cations Zn2+ or Cu2+. These results are consistent with the classification of nsP2 as a thiol proteinase of the papain superfamily and with data already described for Pro39 (Vasiljeva et al., 2001), cathepsin B (Lockwood, 2004) or papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Han et al., 2005). However, the mechanism of Zn2+, Cu2+ and Fe3+ inhibition is unclear due to the lack of molecular structures available, the diversity and the very low similarity inside the papain-like cysteine proteases family (Russo and Watowich, 2006). It is interesting to note that zinc and zinc conjugates have been proven effective for inhibiting SARS-CoV replication in vivo through simultaneous inhibition of SARS-CoV PLP2 and 3CL proteases (Hsu et al., 2000). As zinc salts (zinc acetate) are already used as therapeutics in humans, they could represent a promising drug for treatment of other viral infections.",
