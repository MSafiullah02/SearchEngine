Methods It was a retrospective study conducted by department of pediatrics of a tertiary care centre in western part of India. The patients were included from the pediatric ward, pediatric surgery ward, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) over a period of three months. All the patients below 12 y of age receiving blood components, admitted in general pediatric wards, pediatric intensive care unit, neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric surgery ward were included in the study. Each transfusion episode was assessed as per predetermined guidelines. Results Of the total 336 episodes of blood component transfusions, 244 episodes were appropriate and 92 episodes were inappropriate. Among these, platelets had highest inappropriate (36.84%) episodes followed by fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (28.95%) and packed red blood cell transfusions (PRBC) (21.21%). Majority inappropriate transfusions were seen in intensive care settings. Conclusions Almost one-third of blood component transfusions (FFP, platelets and PRBC) were given without any definitive indication. Judicious use of various blood products by following recommended guidelines may help in decreasing the inappropriate use of blood components.",

Highest number of PRBC transfusion in neonates was given to those who were more than 2 wk of age and were on oxygen supplementation. It was followed by neonates who were less than 1 wk old both with and without requirement of oxygen with 14 episodes each. In older children the highest frequency of PRBC transfusion was seen in children with blood loss anemia (38 episodes) followed by children who had anemia with Hb < 7 g/dl and were stable, non-cyanotic admitted in PICU (25 episodes) and in pre-operative cases where the hemoglobin was less than 7 g/dl (21 episodes).
