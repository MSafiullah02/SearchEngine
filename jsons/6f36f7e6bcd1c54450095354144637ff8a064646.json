In principle, there are several potential strategies to pharmacologically fight COVID-19: vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies, small-molecule drugs, or natural medicines (e.g., traditional Chinese medicine [TCM]). The timelines for de novo development of a small-molecule drug are historically >6-7 years, and in the best case less than 2 years. Vaccines can be developed much faster, but rapid development in the range of 1-2 years is very challenging. Antibodies to support the body's immune system are also a strategy to combat viral diseases. Again, the typical development timelines are several years. Therefore, is there a hope for a Q11 rapid drug to come to the market? A strategy that is promising in the current situation is drug repurposing. Drug repurposing aims to discover novel indication areas for already approved drugs. 4 The overwhelming advantage of drug repurposing is the potential for much faster approval because of the already extensive knowledge of the drug's behavior in humans.",

The structure, function, and inhibition of the SARS-CoV PLpro has been extensively reviewed. 24 Although the primary function of PLpro and 3CLpro is to process the viral polyprotein in a coordinated manner, PLpro has the additional function of stripping ubiquitin and ISG15 from host-cell proteins to help CoV to evade the host innate immune responses. Therefore, it was recently argued that targeting PLpro with antiviral drugs might have an advantage in not only inhibiting viral replication but also inhibiting the dysregulation of signaling cascades in infected cells that might lead to cell death in surrounding, uninfected cells. 24 Different compounds forming a covalent bond to the active-site Cys112 have been described, including epoxyketones, a-halo-ketones, alkynes, aldehydes, trifluoromethyl ketones, a,b-unsaturated ketone, activated esters, or vinyl sulfones. Disulfiram (19) , an approved drug for the treatment of chronic alcohol dependence, has a great potential for drug repurposing because it has been shown to inhibit PLpro of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. 25 The antimetabolites 6-mercaptopurine (20) and 6-thioguanine (21) are additional drugs inhibiting PLpro.",

It uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for entry into target cells. 30, 31 The interplay of the ACE receptor in cardiovascular diseases (with the well-known drug class of ACE inhibitors) and as the docking point for SARS-CoV-2 cellular infection is a current point of intense debate and research. 32 It was found that several critical residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with SARS-CoV-2's capacity for human cell infection.",

The presumed mode of action of the adenosine analog prodrug remdesivir is pre-mature RNA synthesis termination by incorporation into nascent viral RNA chains. 41 Galidesivir (26) is another antiviral drug under clinical development with potential in COVID-19 treatment (Figure 7 ). It is an adenosine analog and is currently developed for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease. It also shows broadspectrum antiviral activity against RNA virus families including CoVs. 42 Multiple other RdRp inhibitors are described in the literature, for example, broadspectrum antiviral 6 0 -bis fluorinated aristeromycin analog (27). 43 Chloroquine (28) is an existing anti-malaria medicine also used to treat several other diseases. It blocked virus infection with an EC 50 of 1.13 mM. 39, 40 Its mode of action is unclear. However, chloroquine inhibits endosomal acidification and thus could stop the release of viral DNA into the cytoplasm. It is under assessment in more than 100 patients at over ten hospitals in Beijing and Guangdong province. Plans for an additional study in Hunan province are underway.",

The rapid worldwide spread and the high human-to-human transmissibility, combined with the inability to contain the pandemic, is causing an increasing death toll and also considerable paralysis of the world economy (Table 2   Q22 ). The COVID-19 could decrease and disappear or could be established worldwide in the human population and reoccur seasonally in future mutations through zoonosis from one of the animal reservoirs. However, it is very likely that in the upcoming years, we will see more outbreaks from CoV and other viruses. The basic, translational, and public health research communities have to prepare for this much better. The outbreak has emphasized the urgent need for renewed efforts to develop broad-spectrum antiviral agents to combat CoVs. On the positive side, much new information of the virus biology and the spread was immediately shared, whereas, on the negative side, many past opportunities to develop antivirals against CoVs were not taken, despite a large number of promising approaches and compounds. 46 The past decade has shown that CoV outbreaks are regularly reoccurring with more or less health effect on human and livestock. It remains to be hoped that the current pandemic will slow down and end as predicted in summer. Furthermore, it turns out that containment measures are not effective to avoid more severe spread. It remains to be seen whether efficient and long-lasting immunity will develop in the infected population with regard to future outbreaks and whether pharmacological measures can be rapidly developed to be able to treat severely sick people.
