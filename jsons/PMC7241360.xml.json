We pulled the mayo stand as shown in figure over the head of the patient, adjusted the height of the stand, and covered it with the plastic sheet to fully enclose the mouth and face of the patient before we started the CPR. In our simulation, the person performing chest compression was stationed to the right side of the manikin \u2018victim\u2019 who is not intubated. The model simulates the beginning of cardiac arrest resuscitation before a definitive airway is established. The HCW performing chest compression is donned in appropriate PPE as per CDC guidelines. Glow germ \u2122 was used to simulate aerosols during the CPR.",
