In addition to the peracute disease course, resulting in death, most cases are characterized by a red-brownish diarrhoea, sometimes containing blood. This is accompanied by a hemorrhagic to hemorrhagic necrotizing inflammation of the middle and posterior sections of the small intestine. In view of the high morbidity and mortality rates, NE is a cause of serious financial losses in pig rearing.",

The presence of \u03b2-toxins can be demonstrated in the mesenterial lymph nodes by this time, indicating that absorption takes place at an early stage [6]. The action of the toxins on the enterocytes culminates in their necrosis. With the epithelium exposed, the clostridia are now in a position to attach themselves to the villous stroma, i.e. to the basal membrane. Here, they rapidly bring about massive necrosis of the mucosa and submucosa, together with destruction of the villous vessels, causing leakage of erythrocytes into the lumen of the bowels. The level of \u03b2-toxin in the blood rises massively, resulting in enterotoxemia.",
