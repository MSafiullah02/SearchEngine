When the test could not be performed at this occasion, or when the patient was not in stable condition, the criteria for permanent airway obstruction was assessed on the basis of previous spirometry performed on the patient, in stable condition, within 6 months prior to hospitalization, or at a further follow-up 1 month later. Patients in whom spirometry at the follow-up did not demonstrate a sufficient degree of airway obstruction were withdrawn from the study. In patients who underwent more than one spirometric test during the period beginning 6 months before hospitalization and ending 2 months after discharge, the best result was used. All spirometric tests were conducted by an experienced technician using the Vitalograph Compact instrument (Vitalograph, Buckingham, UK), which was calibrated at the beginning of each work day.

Serologic tests for seven respiratory tract viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis were conducted using the enzyme immunoassay method. Microimmunofluorescence serology was used for identification of Legionella spp. Only a significant change in the antibody level or titer for a specific pathogen between the acute-phase and convalescence-phase serum samples was considered diagnostic for infection with that pathogen. In light of this requirement, only patients for whom paired sera were obtained were included in the final data analyses.

The name of this article expresses the position we take on this question, even though the issue is controversial. According to American Thoracic Society standards, CAP is not excluded from the diagnosis of AECOPD,1 but according to the British Thoracic Society guidelines, COPD patients with CAP do not receive a diagnosis of AECOPD.9 In a recent review of treatment for AECOPD10 and in other studies related to AECOPD,11\n12 pneumonia was excluded; in the studies by Anthonisen et al2 and Connors et al,13 pneumonia was not excluded; and in still another study,14 only severe pneumonia was excluded. Finally, in one study, pneumonia was listed as excluded, but the study was conducted on an outpatient basis and chest radiographs were not obtained routinely on every patient with AECOPD.15 This semantic controversy has led to a state in which CAP in a patient with COPD with clinical manifestations of AECOPD will be called pneumonic AECOPD by some and CAP in a patients with COPD by others. Our decision to prefer the approach that does not exclude patients with CAP from the diagnosis of AECOPD stemmed from the two following primary considerations: (1) in a patient in whom the clinical expression of the episode completely meets the accepted criteria for AECOPD and only by chest radiography does one know that CAP is present, there is no justification to eliminate the diagnosis of AECOPD and it is appropriate to note that the patient has a pneumonic exacerbation, thereby strengthening the therapeutic significance of this combination of events; (2) most AECOPD episodes take place and are treated in the community framework on an outpatient basis.16 In this framework, chest radiographs are not routinely obtained and exclusion of CAP is not a practical alternative.",

In contrast, a statistically significant difference was found in most of the parameters that reflect the clinical and laboratory severity of the acute episode. As expected, this difference demonstrated a more severe exacerbation in the PNAE group. It should be noted that these differences are based on group means. A patient-by-patient analysis of these same parameters shows that a substantial number of patients in the NPAE group had more severe values than some of the PNAE patients. The significance of this finding, in our opinion, is that the clinical and laboratory severity of AECOPD cannot serve as a reliable predictor of CAP in these acute episodes. Similarly, the clinical type of the exacerbation cannot predict whether the acute disease was caused by CAP.",

The issue of the preferred method to determine the infectious etiology in respiratory infections in general and in CAP and AECOPD in particular is very complicated, and a detailed discussion would be beyond the scope of this article. The factors that brought us to choose the serologic method as the diagnostic method in this study have been detailed and discussed in our previous publication.7 Among the etiologies tested for, two viruses known to cause infection in patients with COPD are missing. These are coronavirus and rhinovirus (the cause of the common cold). The serologic diagnosis of these two viruses is particularly difficult, so they were not included in this study. However, at least concerning rhinovirus, the rate of patients with COPD with this infection who require hospitalization is very low compared to other viruses.17 Another respiratory pathogen that is conspicuously missing from the list of etiologies is Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniae. This pathogen is recognized as an important etiological agent in CAP18 and was included in the original list of etiologies tested for in this study. However, in the data-analysis stage, there was no case, in any of the 240 hospitalizations, in which the antibody titer for C pneumoniae changed significantly between the paired sera for any of the antibody types tested. We believe that the feasibility of diagnosing an acute infection with this pathogen on the basis of a high, unchanging titer is particularly problematic in patients with COPD who are known to have a high prevalence of chronic infection with this pathogen, as diagnosed by a high antibody titer.19 In these circumstances, we preferred to exclude this etiology, despite the obvious problems associated with this solution. It is reasonable to assume that at least some of the patients who were defined in this study as \u201cagent not identified\u201d were infected by one of these pathogens that are missing from the list of etiologies for AECOPD infections.",

It is interesting that this rate of 43% for pneumococcal etiology is identical to the rate found in our previous study in which similar methods were used to test 346 hospitalized patients with CAP, only a few of whom were patients with COPD.20 Even more surprising and interesting is the identity between this finding in the present study and the rate of pneumococcal etiology of 43% reported in the Spanish study that evaluated CAP etiologies in patients with COPD.6 This identity was found even though that study used a spectrum of diagnostic methods that are totally different from those used in the present study. In our opinion, this identity in the rates of pneumococcal etiology in the two studies lends support to the robustness of the finding. Furthermore, we see in this identity indirect, but convincing, proof of the reliability of the serologic method for diagnosing pneumococcal infections. Comparison of the other findings in our study with the Spanish studies points to a substantial difference in the viral etiologies that were identified in 78% of patients in our study compared to a miniscule rate in the Spanish study. Atypical bacterial agents were also found at much lower rates in the Spanish study compared to ours. Based on our knowledge of the sensitivity of the various methods that were used in both studies, we assume that the differences relating to viral and atypical bacterial etiologies stem from the high sensitivity of the methods used in our study. In addition, a convalescence serum sample was obtained from all patients in our study, which has great importance in the serologic diagnosis of viral and atypical bacterial etiologies.",

In those studies these two bacteria, especially H influenzae, were identified as the predominant organisms. The explanation for these results in the present study is that the immunologic/serologic reaction to these two bacteria is strain specific.21\n22 The serologic assay for the two bacteria utilized antigens derived from nonhomologous strains and therefore underestimated the role of infections with these two bacteria in the exacerbations. This limitation of the serologic method in relation to these two bacteria is particularly important from the point of view of the frequency distribution of all etiologies for AECOPD found in our study and for any therapeutic conclusions that may be derived from it.",

The American Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of adults with CAP that were recently published23 were based, among others, on two important observations that have been confirmed in a number of studies over the past decade. One observation is the relatively high prevalence of atypical pathogens among the causes of CAP, and the other observation is the not-uncommon possibility that more than one pathogen (mixed infection) participated in the pathogenesis of CAP. From the viewpoint of these two observations, the findings of the present study indicate a similar rate of atypical etiologies in both groups and the absence of a significant difference in the rate of mixed infections between the two groups, even though the rate is higher in the PNAE group. These findings raise the speculative question of whether it does not make sense to recommend the same antibiotic therapy for patients with AECOPD with and without CAP? This important question should be tested in further studies designed to specifically address this issue.",
