Defects of trafficking have been recently recognized as an important cell biological mechanism in various human diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders, and autoimmune and metabolic diseases including diabetes [1]. Both exocytotic and endocytotic traffic should be regulated by the different forms of \u2018protons\u2019 including transmembrane pH gradient, membrane potential and the acidic pH lumen of their intracellular organelles. The acidic environments outside the cells are also important for mammals, examples being osteoclast bone resorption lacuna, and the extracellular compartment of tumors as well as renal tubular and epididymal lumens. V-ATPase is a major proton pump in the proton homeostasis of eukaryotic cells. In accordance with their crucial roles in cellular function, V-ATPases have been also implicated in the pathophysiology of various human diseases [2, 3\u2022\u2022].",

Generally accepted roles of V-ATPase include establishing acidic pH, which gives optimal conditions for enzymes in the lumens of compartments such as lysosomes and bone resorption lacuna. Acidic pH is also necessary for the entry of viruses, bacteria and dissociation of internalized ligand\u2013receptor complexes in endosomes. The electrochemical proton gradient constitutes a driving force for the accumulation of neurotransmitters and hormones into secretory vesicles. However, recent studies revealed that, in addition to well-known functions of V-ATPase, its subunits may have direct roles in the regulation of vesicular trafficking.",

Both yeast and mammalian V-ATPases share a high degree of homology in their subunit compositions [7] and similarities in biochemical mechanism [3\u2022\u2022, 4, 5]. The cytoplasmic V1-sector is composed of eight different subunits with defined stoichiometry (A3B3CDEFG2H1-2) and is responsible for ATP hydrolysis. The transmembrane VO-sector is composed of six different subunits (ac4c\u2032c\u2033de) and is responsible for proton translocation. Functionally, the catalytic hexamer A3B3 is connected to the proton pathway by stalks. The central stalk (formed by subunits D and F) is attached to a ring of hydrophobic subunits (c, c,\u2032 c\u2033) and operates as a \u2018rotor\u2019 (Figure 1a, in red). The cytosolic N-terminal domain of the a-subunit together with the C, E, G, and H subunits form two peripheral stalks. They are attached to the A3B3 hexamer and form a \u2018stator\u2019. Thus, ATP hydrolysis and proton pumping are coupled by a rotary mechanism, that is, rotation of a \u2018rotor\u2019 relative to a \u2018stator\u2019 in the nano-machine.",

Homologous subunits, such as the A-subunit of V-ATPase and the \u03b2-subunit of F-ATPase are shown in the same color. Both models (Figure 1a,b) are consistent with experiments showing subunit rotation in bacterial F-ATPase [5, 8, 9\u2022\u2022, 10\u2022] and yeast V-ATPase [5, 11\u2022] (see Supplementary Information, Figures S1, S2 and Movies S1, S2). In spite of their similarities, there are important differences between F-ATPase and V-ATPase. F-ATPase is exclusively localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it operates predominantly as an ATP-synthase, coupled with the proton motive force (pmf) generated by the respiratory chain (Figure 1b). By contrast, V-ATPases are found in diverse endomembrane organelles and plasma membranes (Figure 2\n), and function as proton pumps (Figure 1a). The targeting, function and regulation of V-ATPase is more complex than F-ATPase and depend on the specificity of cell biological function as well as membrane composition and cytosolic environment of these compartments.",

The expression of these isoforms is tissue-specific and cell-specific. The B subunit isoform B1 is specific for kidney and inner ear, whereas B2 is ubiquitous. Thus, the mutations of B1 are not lethal, but cause human renal acidosis with hearing defects [14]. V-ATPase with C1 is found ubiquitously, whereas C2-a is found specifically in the lamellar bodies of lung alveolar epithelial cells responsible for surfactant secretion and C2-b is found in plasma membranes of renal \u03b1-intercalated and \u03b2-intercalated cells responsible for ion homeostasis [18, 19]. V-ATPase with the E1 isoform is located specifically in developing acrosomes of spermatids and acrosomes in mature sperm, whereas E2 is expressed in all tissues that have been examined [17]. The G subunit isoform, G1 is expressed ubiquitously, whereas G2 and G3 are found in neuron synaptic vesicles and kidney, respectively [20]. Recent immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that V-ATPases with unique combinations of subunit isoforms are localized in specific cellular membranes that could dictate their functions [18, 21].",

All four isoforms are expressed in mouse kidney proximal tubule cells, however, while a1-isoform, a3-isoform, and a4-isoform are targeted to the plasma membrane, the a2-isoform is targeted to early endosomes in situ (Figure 2) [30\u2022\u2022]. Specific localization of a4 to the plasma membrane and a2 to early endosomes in proximal tubule cells is shown (Figure 4e,f) (see Supplementary Information, Figure S3 and Movie S3). It is noteworthy that in these cells a2-isoform does not target to Golgi (Figure 4g). By contrast, both a2-isoform and a1-isoform are targeted to the Golgi complex in cultured osteoclast cells (Figure 4h) [28\u2022\u2022]. Interestingly, recent studies suggested that the a2-isoform is involved in Golgi function and development of congenital disorders of glycosylation in humans [31\u2022\u2022]. The kidney specific a4-isoform is also specifically targeted to the apical plasma membrane of collecting duct intercalated and epididymal clear cells [32]. In nerve terminals, the a1-isoform is specifically delivered to synaptic vesicles from which it could also be relocated to the presynaptic plasma membrane [33]. Although it is generally accepted that a-subunit isoforms are crucial for trafficking V-ATPase, the mechanism of their specific targeting is currently unknown in mammalian cells.",

In yeast, this mechanism is regulated by a-isoforms of V-ATPase and dependent on the cellular and membrane environment where the two isoforms are located [3\u2022\u2022, 38, 39\u2022, 40]. V-ATPase (with Vph1p a-subunit) targeted to vacuoles is disassembled upon glucose depletion, whereas that (with Stv1p a-subunit) targeted to the Golgi does not [38]. However, V-ATPase with a chimeric a-subunit of Vph1p and Stv1p (N-terminal and C-terminal, respectively) and localized in vacuoles is disassembled. These results suggest that the N-terminal cytosolic tail of a-subunits function as a glucose sensor [3\u2022\u2022] and its function also depends upon the cytosolic, lumenal and/or membrane environment where V-ATPase is localized [40]. The glucose-dependent assembly/disassembly of V-ATPase is partly controlled by vacuolar luminal pH [39\u2022]; however, this is not the only cellular parameter involved [40]. The disassembly (but not assembly) involves the cytosolic microtubular network [3\u2022\u2022], whereas the assembly (but not disassembly) requires the cytosolic RAVE (regulator of H+-ATPase of vacuolar and endosomal membranes) complex [34].",

In renal intercalated and epididymal clear cells, the density of V-ATPase in the plasma membrane is controlled by a balance of endocytosis and exocytosis of apical vesicles containing the same enzyme [42, 43]. The V-ATPase generates an electrochemical proton gradient or proton-motive force consisting of membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8) and proton gradient (\u0394pH). In endosomes, they promote electrophoretic chloride transport via the CLC5 exchanger (2Cl\u2212/H+-antiporter) increasing the acidity of the compartment (Figure 1a) [44, 45]. The values of \u0394\u03a8 27 mV and \u0394pH 2.2 units were recently determined in direct FRET experiments in early phagosomes where the lumenal pH is 5.2 [46\u2022\u2022]. Chloride accumulation during endosomal acidification (with a lumen pH of 5.3\u20135.6) was also shown in vivo [47]. The emerging roles of the CLC-family of chloride transporters in the endosomal/lysosomal pathway [44, 45] as well as important roles of the NHE-family of cation/proton exchangers in organellar acidification and homeostasis were recently discussed [48].",

According to this model, the c-subunits of VO are directly involved in the fusion of two vacuoles (VO\ntrans-complex formation) which also depends on Rab-GTPase Ypt7 and calmodulin [55\u2022\u2022]. Inactivation of the Vph1p a-subunit also blocks fusion between VO sectors [56, 57]. It is noteworthy that in contrast to fusion, vacuole fission and fragmentation in vivo depends on proton pumping by V-ATPase [57]. Although the exact molecular mechanism of VO\ntrans-complex formation remains controversial, recent studies suggest a direct role of V-ATPase in fusion in other organisms (Figure 2). In Drosophila melanogaster, the VO a-subunit has been implicated in synaptic vesicle fusion [58] and the a1-isoform directly interacts with calmodulin at fly synapses [59]. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the a-subunit mediates secretion of Hedgehog-related proteins from exosomes to the apical membrane [60]. Finally, crystallographic studies of the c-ring of Nephrops norvegicus V-ATPase also suggest the direct role of the VO-sector in membrane fusion [61].",

Thus, localization of the V-ATPase a3-isoform is a dynamic membrane process. In human osteoclasts the a3-subunit is colocalized with the VO d2-isoform [66]. Knockout of d2-isoform in mice results in markedly increased bone mass because of defective osteoclasts and enhanced bone formation [67\u2022\u2022]. However, the disruption of the d2-gene did not affect osteoclast differentiation or V-ATPase activity, suggesting the direct role of the d2-isoform in the fusion of osteoclast progenitors. Exocytosis of lysosomes is an important function in phagocyte-derived, neutrophil-derived, and monocyte-derived cells including macrophages and osteoclasts.

For example, membrane fusion of vesicular stomatitis virus and its escape to the cytosol depends upon the endosomal acidic lumen. The function of the M2-protein from influenza A-virus and SARS coronavirus proteinase also need acidification. The translocation of various toxins from endosomes to the cytosol also depends upon acidification and includes among others: anthrax, diphtheria, and clostridial toxins [68, 70, 71]. An alternative survival strategy is applied by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These microorganisms diminish the acidity of phagosomes and impair their fusion with lysosomes [69].",

This protein degradation pathway also depends on endosomal acidification, with defects in this process leading to proximal tubulopathies in humans and mice [53]. Early studies on small GTPases demonstrated the colocalization of V-ATPase with Arf6 and ADP-ribosylation factor nucleotide site opener (ARNO) in early endosomes of the degradation pathway [79]. The recruitment of these small GTPases was driven by intra-endosomal acidic pH, and the presence of PSP in the endosomes was proposed [80]. Recently, V-ATPase has been identified as pH-sensor that directly interacts with small GTPases in an acidification-dependent manner [30\u2022\u2022, 81, 82]. In particular, the a2-isoform is targeted to early endosomes of the proximal tubule (Figure 2) (Figure 4e,f) (see Supplementary Information, Figure S3 and Movie S3) and directly interacts with ARNO in acidification-dependent manner, while Arf6 specifically interacts with the c-subunit of the VO-sector of V-ATPase. Importantly, these studies also demonstrated that the acidification-dependent interaction between V-ATPase and small GTPases is crucial for protein trafficking between early and late endosomes [30\u2022\u2022] (see Supplementary Information, Figure S4 and Movies S4,S5). Although these studies showed that V-ATPase could modulate vesicular trafficking by scaffolding and recruiting small GTPases, the downstream targets of this V-ATPase/ARNO/Arf6 complex as well as functional significance of this rendezvous remains to be elucidated.",

The transition between the \u2018on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019 states of this molecular device is mediated by the GDP/GTP cycle. The ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) family belongs to the Ras-superfamily and also functions as a molecular switch to regulate vesicular traffic and organelle structure [84]. The activation of Arfs (GTP-bound conformation, \u2018on\u2019-state) is mediated by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), while deactivation (GDP-bound conformation, \u2018off\u2019-state) is catalyzed by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Both small GTPase Arf6 and its cognate GEFs and GAPs have been implicated in the regulation of the endocytotic pathway and organelle biogenesis by: first, recruiting coat components; second, modifying phospholipids; and third, remodeling the cytoskeleton near vesicular membranes [30\u2022\u2022, 85\u2022\u2022]. Thus, the acidification-dependent recruitment of ARNO/Arf6 and their binding to endosomal V-ATPase may trigger these downstream pathways giving rise to the endosome carrier vesicles (ECV/MVB) formation.",

            "text": "Finding the interaction between V-ATPase and small GTPases pointed out the intriguing possibility that small GTPases might function as \u2018molecular on/off switches\u2019 for V-ATPase function. The following results suggest possible \u2018cross-talk\u2019 between V-ATPase/small GTPase interaction and disassembly/assembly of V-ATPase. First, the glucose-dependent disassembly of V-ATPase is also controlled by the acidification of vacuoles suggesting the presence of a vacuolar pH-sensor [3\u2022\u2022, 39\u2022, 40]. Second, V-ATPase is known to directly interact with the actin-microfilament cytoskeleton [3\u2022\u2022, 6, 86] and requires an intact microtubular network for the dissociation of VOV1 complex [3\u2022\u2022]. Thus, when recruited to V-ATPase, Arf6 could be involved in cytoskeleton remodeling [3\u2022\u2022, 6, 85\u2022\u2022, 87]. Third, binding of V-ATPase to F-actin [86] and glucose-dependent assembly of the VOV1 complex [36] depend on PI3-kinase activity, that is also necessary for specific recruitment of ARNO [88] and Arf6-mediated actin dynamics [89]. Finally, aldolase modulates assembly/disassembly of V-ATPase by the interaction with the a, B, and E subunits [35\u2022\u2022, 36, 37]. Recently, the direct and specific interaction of aldolase with ARNO has been demonstrated (Marshansky Laboratory, unpublished data) suggesting that ARNO can modulate the assembly/disassembly of the V-ATPase/aldolase complex. On the basis of these data it is tempting to propose that the pH-sensing function of V-ATPase and the acidification-dependent recruitment of small GTPases are integral parts of the glucose/aldolase-dependent regulation of V-ATPase. Thus, the generally accepted function of small GTPases as \u2018molecular switches\u2019 may directly be applied to the assembly/disassembly of V-ATPase and turning \u2018on/off\u2019 this remarkable nano-machine.",

The comparative subunit composition of transmembrane (VO and FO) and peripheral (V1 and F1) sectors are indicated on the left, while the catalytic hexamers, stalks and proton pathways are indicated on the right. Homologous subunits, such as the A-subunit of V-ATPase and the \u03b2-subunit of F-ATPase are shown in the same colors. (a) V-ATPase is shown as a primary proton pumping nano-motor. ATP hydrolysis drives clockwise rotation of the central stalk and ring of proteolipid subunits indicated in red. This rotation leads to the translocation of protons from the cytosol to form an acidic lumen of endomembrane organelles, and generates an electrochemical proton gradient or proton-motive force (pmf) across the membrane. In endosomes the V-ATPase promotes the neutralizing current mediated by electrogenic CLC-5 (nCl\u2212/H+-exchanger with unknown stoichiometry, which might be n = 2 as in its bacterial homologue [45]) and drives further acidification. The values of pmf components \u0394\u03a8 and \u0394pH were recently determined for the early phagosomal compartment [46\u2022\u2022]. (b) Mitochondrial ATP-synthase (also called F-ATPase) is shown as a secondary pump. F-ATPase function (proton translocation, counter clockwise rotation, and coupled ATP synthesis) is driven by pmf that is primarily generated during the function of respiratory chain enzymes. The function and rotation of both V-ATPase and F-ATPase are reversible under certain experimental conditions.

Vesicular trafficking steps are indicated for endocytosis in red arrows and for exocytosis in blue arrows. Differential targeting of V-ATPase is cell-specific and compartment-specific. Localization of V-ATPase a-isoforms is shown as demonstrated in Figure 4 and described in text. (i) In particular, V-ATPase with a1-isoform is targeted to Golgi and involved in synaptic vesicles fusion and secretion. It is also found on presynaptic plasma membrane. (ii) V-ATPase with a2-isoform is targeted either to early endosomes or to Golgi. In early endosomes a2-isoform functions as pH-sensor by recruiting small GTPases in acidification dependent manner and involved in the formation of endosomal carrier vesicles also known as multivesicular bodies (ECV/MVB).
