Coronavirus, which usually causes respiratory-tract infections in humans, has been linked to several infectious diseases and subsequent global challenges (1, 2). In December 2019, clusters of patients with viral pneumonia were confirmed to be infected with a novel coronavirus. The infection caused by the novel coronavirus was named as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and this coronavirus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the World Health Organization and International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (3). As of March 31th, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has caused 81 554 infections and 3312 deaths in China (4), which far exceeds those caused by both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV worldwide. An increasing number of studies have suggested that people of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases. Moreover, human-to-human hospital-associated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be possible (5, 6).",

Open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N) were simultaneously amplified and tested during the real-time RT-PCR assay. The real-time RT-PCR assay was performed using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Shanghai bio-germ Medical Technology Co Ltd).

The disease severity and improvement were defined according to the interim guidelines from the World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China (7, 8). According to the patients\u2019 symptoms, laboratory results and imaging findings at admission, the disease severity of COVID-19 patients (also known as patients\u2019 conditions) can be divided into four types, including mild, moderate, severe, and critical conditions. Patients with slight clinical symptoms and without imaging findings of pneumonia are treated as mild condition. When patients have fever or respiratory symptoms, they are identified as moderate condition. If patients have one of the three situations, they are considered as severe condition: respiratory distress and the respiratory rate is higher than 30 times per minute; fingertip blood oxygen saturation is less than 93% at rest; Partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspiration oxygen (FiO2) \u2264300mmHg. When patients contain one of the following three situation, they are identified as critical condition: respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation; shock condition; with other organ failure requires ICU treatment. Acute kidney injury was diagnosed according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines (9). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed according to the Berlin definition (10). Meanwhile, patients exhibiting one of the following situations during follow-up were considered to have improvement: continuously decreased temperature or normal temperature (below 37.3\u00b0C), improved respiratory symptoms (disappeared or obviously relieved), gradual reduction of pulmonary inflammation upon imaging analysis (obviously reduced shadow area), negative results of SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR detection. Otherwise, they were considered to show unimprovement.",

This heterogeneity is probably due to differences in the case inclusion criteria. However, our results were closer to the mortality rate indicated by official national statistics, which is 3.97%. Cumulative studies confirmed that older age was associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients. In our study, older patients were prone to have severe COVID-19 symptoms, unimprovemrnt, and were more likely to die in hospitals. Based on previous findings in animal studies, older animals were shown to have stronger host innate immune responses to SARS-CoV infection (12). The unsatisfactory control of viral replication and more prolonged proinflammatory responses in older individuals due to age-dependent defects was found to lead to a marked decline in cell-mediated immune function and reduced humoral immune function, which potentially leads to poor outcomes (13, 14).",

In our study, approximately one in six COVID-19 patients had digestive symptoms, especially diarrhea, which is more than was reported in a previous study (11). The digestive symptoms of most COVID-19 patients were mild, which seemed to be inconsistent with the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. A possible explanation is that SARS-CoV-2 in the sputum of COVID-19 patients is transmitted to the digestive tract through swallowing. There, under the action of various digestive enzymes, the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 in the digestive tract is weakened and the virus is degraded into fragments that only cause mild digestive symptoms but not serious gastrointestinal damage.",
