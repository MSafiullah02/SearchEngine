The yeast two-hybrid vectors pGBK/T7 and pGAD/T7, the mammalian two-hybrid vectors pM and pVP16 were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The nucleocapsid gene (GenBank Accession No. AY274119) was amplified by RT-PCR from the SARS-CoV RNA isolated from SARS-infected patients as described [10]. Primers for the amplification are 5\u2032 GTACGAATTCATGTCTGATAATGGACCCCAATC 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 GTACGGATCC-GTGGTCATCATGAGTGTTTATG 3\u2032. The amplified product was then purified with MiniElute PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), followed by digestion with EcoRI and BamHI (underlined sequence in primers). The digested DNA fragments were subsequently ligated in-frame into pGBK/T7, pGAD/T7, pM, and pVP16 vectors. As additional controls under the same assay conditions for N, the gene for SARS-CoV membrane (M) was amplified with the following primers: 5\u2032 GTACGAATTCATG-GCAGACAACGGTA 3\u2032 and GTACGGATCC-TTACTGTACTAGCAAAGCA. The PCR product was cloned into the above-noted vectors in EcoRI and BamHI sites. PCR primers for the cloning of the N gene into pAs-Red2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) fluorescent vector (designated as pAsRed-N) are 5\u2032 GTACGAATTCTATGTCTGATAATGGACCCCAATC 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 GTACGGATCCGT-GGTCATCATGAGTGT-TTATG 3\u2032. The expression vector for SARS-CoV M gene is designated as pGBK-M and pGAD-M in this report. To identify putative domains of amino acid sequences required for multimerization, sequential deletion starts from 5\u2032 in the nucleocapsid gene, all sense primers used in the study carry EcoRI restriction site (Table 1\n), and the antisense primer sequence is the same one used for full-length nucleocapsid gene cloning as mentioned above. Primers for these fragments are listed in Table 1. The sequential deletions resulted in an approximately 40 nt truncation (see below for details). In addition to sequential deletion mutants, a serine/arginine-rich motif (amino acid 184\u2013196) was deleted using following primers: 5\u2032 [Phosp]AGAGGCTTGACTGCCG-CCTCTGCTTCC 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 [Phosp]AATTCA-ACTCCTGGCAGCAGTAG 3\u2032. This mutant was designated as \u0394pM-N/SR.",

These mutants\u2019 fragments were cloned into mammalian two-hybrid vector pM. The eight sequential truncation mutants of the SARS-CoV N protein, designated from \u0394pM-N1 to \u0394pM-N8, were co-transfected with pG5SEAP reporter vector and pVP-N, which contains full-length N gene. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, a chemiluminescence-based assay was conducted to measure the protein\u2013protein interaction activity through the SEAP reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 4B, \u0394pM-N1 (aa 43\u2013423), \u0394pM-N2 (aa 84\u2013423), \u0394pM-N3 (aa 126\u2013423), and \u0394pM-N4 (aa 168\u2013423) showed similar levels of chemiluminescence activities compared with full-length N protein. Importantly, it is noted that deletion of 168\u2013208 resulted in a loss of N\u2013N self-interaction, since virtually no chemiluminescence activity was observed in mutants \u0394pM-N5, \u0394pM-N6, \u0394pM-N7, and \u0394pM-N8. Because a region composed of 41 amino acids from aa 168 to 208 has been found to be crucial for N multimerization in the above mapping study, we were interested in employing a further investigation on a specific epitope in this region, which is pivotal for the N self-multimerization. It came to our attention from protein sequence analyses that there is a serine/arginine-rich region, which appears to be relatively conserved among most coronaviruses following GenBank searches. We consequently decided to delete this motif and use the mutant \u0394pM-N/SR. As shown in Fig. 4C, deletion of the serine/arginine-rich region (aa 184\u2013196) resulted in a complete loss of SEAP activities, suggesting these amino acids are required for N self-interaction. Finally, consistent with results in Fig. 2, no self-interaction was observed in the viral M proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that amino acids 184\u2013196 are indispensable for multimerization of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein.",

The N protein and its SR-deletion mutant were cloned into a red-color fluorescent vector pAs-Red2; the two vectors were, respectively, co-transformed with a nuclear localization vector pECFP-nuc. As indicated in Fig. 5A\n, the wild-type N protein was localized around the nucleus, forming an eclipse-like protein localization, while the SR-deletion mutant (Fig. 5B) demonstrated a completely different distribution pattern with scattered localization surrounding the nucleus. This result implicated that the SR region in the SARS-CoV N protein was not only responsible for the multimerization of the protein, but also pertinent to the sub-cellular localization of the protein, which is important for the virus assembly.",

The multimerization of nucleocapsid proteins of coronaviruses is possibly a functional form of the protein, which may be involved in the virion assembly by stabilizing the helical structure of the N protein [26]. A study on another coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), revealed that a multimerized form of the nucleocapsid protein was observed from Western blot analysis [26]. Although N\u2013N in MHV has been identified in two independent groups, functional domains for MHV N\u2013N interactions remain to be defined [9]. Two lines of evidence prompted us to conduct the current studies on SARS-CoV N protein: (1) the scarcity of published data on the N\u2013N interaction in other coronaviruses hinders the elucidation of the mechanism involving formation of coronavirus nucleocapsid core; (2) little homology between SARS-CoV N and N proteins of other coronaviruses makes it difficult to link the data obtained from those coronaviruses to the understanding of structures and functions of SARS-CoV N protein, and may even intricate the rationalization of anti-SARS design. To facilitate investigations on the functional roles of SARS-CoV replication we set out to determine whether there is an existence of SARS-CoV N\u2013N self-interaction, by using both yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems, in addition to the mapping of the amino acid sequences responsible for protein multimerization.",

Sub-cellular localization of the viral protein is widely used to characterize the involvement of the protein in the virus assembly [22], [23], [24], [25]. In addition, we also found that deletion of the SR-motif in the N protein resulted in a dramatic change of the sub-cellular localization of the N protein compared to the wild type, further implicating that this motif could be important for viral replication (Fig. 5). Our search for similar protein domains in public protein database (Entrez and ExPASy) yielded little information pertaining to known functional activities associated with similar aa sequences. In MHV (Accession No. NC-001846), a similar motif in the N gene shares only 46% homology with what we have found to be critical for N\u2013N interaction in SARS-CoV. However, it is unknown whether those amino acids are involved in MHV N\u2013N interaction.

Growth of the transformants on the SD/LEU/\u2212TRP plate indicates that both pM- and pVP-related plasmids have been delivered into yeast cells, while the growth on SD/\u2212ADE\u2212HIS/\u2212LEU/\u2212TRP plate reveals activation of reporter genes, and thus interactions of proteins.",
