HMGB1 is one of the most extensively studied DAMPs and is involved in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases of infectious or sterile origin (Andersson and Tracey 2011; Kang et al. 2014). It is a ubiquitous, evolutionary extremely conserved chromatin-binding protein present in all mammalian nucleated cells and platelets. This 25 kD protein is 99% identical in mammals. The intranuclear functions involve regulation of gene transcription, chromatin repair, and additional tasks. HMGB1 may in addition be passively released extracellularly as a prototypical DAMP from dying cells or actively secreted by stressed or activated cells present in any tissue (Andersson et al. 2018a).",

            "text": "Excessive amounts of extracellular HMGB1 cause release of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 (Andersson et al. 2000). Active HMGB1 release is initiated with a regulated translocation of the nuclear pool of HMGB1 to the cytosol (Bonaldi et al. 2003). Type 1 and type 2 interferons are highly potent endogenous molecules that launch this intracellular relocalization of HMGB1 (Lu et al. 2014; Tanaka et al. 2019). Consequently, administration of interferons as therapeutic antiviral compounds risks to increase extracellular HMGB1 levels, which may promote inflammation rather than mediate beneficial effects. Many chronic inflammatory diseases are characterized by increased circulating HMGB1 levels, possibly of importance for the increased risk of severe outcome in COVID-19 patients with inflammatory comorbidities. Excessive extracellular HMGB1 quantities cause tissue damage and organ dysfunction. In a clinical study, lethality in bacterial pneumonia complicated by ARDS was strongly predicted by initial appropriate antibiotic use and plasma HMGB1 levels (Tseng et al. 2014). Treatment with HMGB1-specific antagonists ameliorates inflammation and improves survival in many preclinical models of acute or chronic inflammatory diseases (Andersson and Tracey 2011; Kang et al. 2014; Andersson et al. 2018b; Yang et al. 2020). However, therapy with HMGB1-specific antagonists has not yet been studied in clinical trials.",

HMGB1 generally exists in vivo linked to partner molecules. HMGB1 quantification requires that the plasma/serum samples are incubated in acidic buffers prior to antibody-based assessment methods. Steric hindrance precludes antibody detection of HMGB1 epitopes without a proper removal of HMGB1-partner molecules at the initial buffer exposure. HMGB1 has a strong bipolar charge and is prone to complex-bind other proinflammatory molecules including DNA, RNA, histones, nucleosomes, LPS, SDF-1, IL-1\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 (Andersson et al. 2018a; Tian et al. 2007; Huang et al. 2016; Deng et al. 2018; Porat et al. 2018). The proinflammatory activities mediated by the HMGB1-partner molecules are amplified in a synergistic manner by HMGB1 (Schiraldi et al. 2012; Wahamaa et al. 2011; Hreggvidsdottir et al. 2009; Sha et al. 2008).",

The proinflammatory effects exerted by extracellular HMGB1 were identified at a much later time point (Wang et al. 1999). Experimental studies indicate that HMGB1 plays a critical role in mediating acute lung injury through the recruitment of leukocytes into the lungs (Entezari et al. 2014; Huebener et al. 2015). Furthermore, HMGB1 induced neutrophil dysfunction in experimental sepsis by reducing the NADPH oxidase activity, while treatment with anti-HMGB1 Ab in contrast significantly diminished the sepsis-induced neutrophil dysfunction (Gregoire et al. 2017). Hyperoxia significantly increased the accumulation of HMGB1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids prior to the onset of severe inflammatory lung injury (Entezari et al. 2014).",

Neutralizing anti-HMGB1 antibodies attenuated pulmonary edema and inflammatory responses, as indicated by decreased total protein content, wet/dry weight ratio, and numbers of leukocytes in the airways (Entezari et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2005). Furthermore, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from patients receiving long-term mechanical ventilation and ventilator-associated pneumonia have been demonstrated to contain high levels of HMGB1 (van Zoelen et al. 2008). A further understanding of a pathogenic role of local HMGB1 release in pulmonary barotrauma is provided by studies in rabbits exposed to mechanical ventilation with large versus small tidal volumes (Ogawa et al. 2006). Large tidal volumes caused prominent ventilator-induced lung injury, which was associated with 5-fold higher HMGB1 concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid than those in the low tidal group. Immunostaining of lung tissue showed that alveolar macrophages and infiltrating neutrophils were the major sources of extracellular HMGB1. Interestingly, prophylactic intratracheal installation of anti-HMGB1 antibodies limited microvascular permeability and neutrophil influx into the alveolar lumen and improved oxygenation.",

Many receptor systems are linked to HMGB1 signaling, however several of them are actually receptors for molecules complex-bound to HMGB1.",

            "text": "The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is constitutively highly expressed on alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs, while other tissues show little to no RAGE expression during basic conditions (Brett et al. 1993; Bierhaus et al. 2005; Oczypok et al. 2017). Subsequent studies have localized RAGE expression to the basal membrane of type 1 alveolar epithelial cells, and RAGE has been defined as a specific marker of these cells (Shirasawa et al. 2004; Fehrenbach et al. 1998; Ota et al. 2016). Conflicting results have been reported regarding RAGE expression on type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (Shirasawa et al. 2004; Katsuoka et al. 1997). RAGE will be expressed on vascular endothelial cells and macrophages during inflammatory responses (Brett et al. 1993) (Bierhaus et al. 2005; Oczypok et al. 2017). RAGE was originally identified in diabetes research as a cell surface receptor generating a cascade of intracellular signaling, including nuclear NF-kB translocation and proinflammatory cytokine release (Schmidt et al. 1996). It was later discovered that RAGE is a multiligand receptor and that HMGB1 is one out of many ligands (Rauvala and Rouhiainen 2007). The HMGB1-RAGE axis triggers neutrophil-mediated injury amplification following necrosis (Huebener et al. 2015), something that is of great significance for the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. Interestingly, HMGB1-RAGE interaction does not primarily lead to proinflammatory intracellular signaling. Macrophages expressing RAGE, but engineered to lack TLR4 expression, do not produce proinflammatory cytokines in response to stimulation by HMGB1 of any redox isoform (Yang et al. 2010). That is not the expected result if HMGB1-RAGE interaction mediated cytokine release in a direct mode.",

            "text": "Recent observations demonstrate that RAGE provides a transport route for extracellular HMGB1 and HMGB1-partner molecule complexes by endocytosis to the endolysosomal compartment (Deng et al. 2018; Porat et al. 2018; Lin et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2019a; Jia et al. 2019; Xu et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2016a) (Fig. 1). The HMGB1/RAGE-assisted cellular import system performs an important task by alerting cells about a dangerous extracellular environment. Most importantly, HMGB1 has a unique ability to act as a detergent in the lysosomal membrane due to the acidic conditions inside the lysosome system (Deng et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2014; Yuan et al. 2020). The HMGB1-transported partner molecules will thus avoid the expected degradation in the lysosomes and instead leak out into the cytosol to reach cognate cytoplasmic receptors, propagating a proinflammatory response. The biological implications of this mechanism may be of tremendous importance for the pathogenesis of severe pulmonary inflammation because the high constitutive cell surface RAGE expression. It has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies that severe respiratory infections including influenza and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) generate substantial extracellular HMGB1 release in pulmonary inflammation and that HMGB1-specific antagonists ameliorate these conditions (Ito et al. 2011; Nosaka et al. 2015; Nosaka et al. 2018; Hatayama et al. 2019; Manti et al. 2018; Rayavara et al. 2018; Rallabhandi et al. 2012; Simpson et al. 2020). Extracellular HMGB1 accumulates locally due to passive release from dying cells and active secretion from innate immunity cells and additional cell types. Furthermore, virus-induced cell death also generates huge quantities of extracellular DNA, RNA, nucleosomes and histones. These molecules are of no major concern as long as they remain extracellularly or get degraded in the lysosomes after cellular import.\n",

While the physiological role of the HMGB1-RAGE pathway in the lungs is elimination of danger molecules carried by HMGB1, the situation is distinctly different in the central nervous system. The original discovery of extracellularly-mediated HMGB1 activity was based on its capacity to mediate neurite outgrowth in the brain via RAGE interaction, without any signs of concomitant inflammation (Merenmies et al. 1991). There are numerous publications on the functional role HMGB1/TLR4-mediated neuroinflammation in brain diseases of both infectious and sterile origin (Ito et al. 2011; Paudel et al. 2018; Nishibori et al. 2019; Frank et al. 2015). COVID-19 also emerges with features of neuroinflammation including fever, loss of small, taste and appetite. We suggest that HMGB1 contributes to these symptoms via TLR4 expression on neurons, microglia cells and astrocytes.",

Arterial HMGB1 concentrations were consistently lower than venous concentrations in simultaneously obtained samples (arterial = 0.60 x venous; 95% CI 0.30\u20130.90). Significant amounts of HMGB1 are thus apparently removed in the pulmonary circulation. We doubt that an elimination of HMGB1 itself is the physiological purpose of this function, but rather to degrade PAMP and DAMP molecules carried by HMGB1. The abundant and selective expression of RAGE in the lungs supports extensive endocytosis of HMGB1-partner molecule complexes. These complexes pass the endosomes to accumulate in the lysosomes. We anticipate that physiological amounts of HMGB1 are insufficient to damage the lysosomal membrane allowing the expected degradation of the HMGB1-partner molecule complexes. However pathologically increased intralysosomal HMGB1 levels might cause lysosomal disruption, as already discussed. The leakage sanctions inflammasome activation generating pyroptosis and tissue injury. We suggest that this may be a main mechanism leading to lung injury.",

Gentle oxidation generating a disulfide bond between Cys23 and Cys45 with Cys106 retaining its thiol group forms an HMGB1 redox isoform (disulfide HMGB1) that like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent functional TLR4 ligand (Kang et al. 2014). Disulfide HMGB1 binds at low nanomolar avidity to the TLR4 co-receptor MD-2, in an analogous way to LPS but at a different position (Yang et al. 2015). Disulfide HMGB1-TLR4 stimulation induces a substantial production of proinflammatory cytokines both in vivo and in vitro (Yang et al. 2010). The clinical outcome of murine influenza infection has been demonstrated to be significantly improved by TLR4-specific antagonists. A small-molecule TLR4-specific antagonist (P5779) that selectively prevents HMGB1-MD-2 interaction, but not LPS from binding to MD-2, protected mice from influenza virus-induced lethality and reduced proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in the lungs (Shirey et al. 2013).",

It is thus conceivable that the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus might reach the cellular cytosol through HMGB1-assisted transport, as previously discussed. It is also of interest that a recent clinical pilot study in France indicated that hydroxychloroquine treatment was significantly associated with a reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load (Gautret et al. 2020).

These viruses, like the SARS-CoV-2 virus, replicate in respiratory epithelial cells and cause necrotic tissue damage. Influenza-infected patients express elevated circulating HMGB1 concentrations that are associated with the development of severe pneumonia (Ito et al. 2011). Gene-deficient TLR4 as well as gene-deficient RAGE mice are partially protected from influenza-induced lethality (van Zoelen et al. 2009; Nhu et al. 2010). Successful preclinical treatment results using specific HMGB1-, TLR4- or RAGE-antagonists further support that the HMGB1/RAGE/TLR4-axis is central in the pathogenesis of influenza infections. Treatment with anti-HMGB1 mAb provided partial protection against both pneumonia and encephalopathy in murine models of influenza infections despite that the treatments did not affect virus propagation in the lungs (Nosaka et al. 2015; Nosaka et al. 2018; Hatayama et al. 2019). Combined anti-HMGB1 mAb and anti-viral treatment offered almost complete protection against lung injury (Hatayama et al. 2019). Improved survival combined with significantly attenuated histological changes and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs of influenza- inoculated mice have been reported, despite that the treatment was based on xenogenic polyclonal antibodies against HMGB1 (Hou et al. 2014). Therapy with the TLR4-blocking compound eritoran ameliorated murine influenza-induced lung injury by inhibiting the cytokine storm. Additionally, eritoran has been reported to block HMGB1-mediated TLR4-dependent signaling in vitro, and to inhibit extracellular HMGB1 release in vivo by preventing necroptotic cell death in respiratory epithelial cells (Shirey et al. 2013; Shirey et al. 2016).",

The binding to caspase-11 causes oligomerization and activation of a complex that converts the pore-forming protein gasdermin D to a cleaved protein promoting the externalization of phosphatidylserine to the outer cell surface via a calcium-dependent phospholipid scramblase (Fig. 1). HMGB1 and LPS also enhance the expression and release of tissue factor that binds phosphatidylserine, which initiates the coagulation cascade. Treatment with anti-HMGB1 mAb in gram-negative sepsis prevented the coagulopathy (Yang et al. 2020). These discoveries have wider implications than gram-negative sepsis biology, since also activated caspase-1, generated by multiple forms of activated inflammasomes, will cleave gasdermin D to a molecule that can activate the coagulation cascade and pyroptosis. The number of DAMPs and PAMPs that activates inflammasomes is considerable.",

A recent observational study of trauma patients reported that a biphasic release of HMGB1, with a second concentration peak 3\u20136 h after injury, was a powerful predictor of outcome (Ottestad et al. 2019b). The first peak occurred immediately after the trauma presumably due to a massive necrotic cell death, however not correlated to outcome. The second-wave HMGB1 was a consistent and highly accurate predictor of the duration of the subsequent need for ventilator support, reflecting secondary remote lung injury. Interestingly, second-wave HMGB1 rendered robust predictors like injury severity and physiological derangement (base deficit) insignificant in multivariable prediction models or outcome, possibly acting as a mediator of the combined detrimental effects of anatomical injury and physiologic derangement after trauma. The reasons for the discrepancy between the predictive value of the second versus the initial peak of HMGB1 release are presently not known. We speculate that the two waves of HMGB1 were made up by different HMGB1 redox isoforms as a plausible explanation.",

            "text": "Chloroquine phosphate-based therapy in China and hydroxychloroquine treatment in South Korea have been reported to improve outcome in COVID-19 infections (Gao et al. 2020), but larger controlled studies are still missing. There are several studies indicating that chloroquine compounds exert direct anti-viral activities. Vincent et al. reported that chloroquine prevented the spread of the SARS coronavirus in cell culture by interfering with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This might negatively influence the virus- receptor binding and thus abrogate the infection (Vincent et al. 2005). As already referred to, a recently published clinical pilot study indicated that hydroxychloroquine treatment was significantly associated with a reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load (Gautret et al. 2020). These and other small anectodal studies have been challenged and randomized clincal trials have yet to establish the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for use in Covid-19. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine compounds also exert multiple anti-inflammatory effects and have been used for a long time to treat chronic inflammation in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The mechanisms for these anti-inflammatory effects are not fully understood, but some have been established and will be outlined here. Chloroquine has been demonstrated to decrease HMGB1 secretion from activated innate immunity cells (Schierbeck et al. 2010). Chloroquine-mediated alkalinization of lysosomes inhibiting HMGB1-caused lysosomal leakage is a plausible mechanism that might be beneficial for COVID-19 treatment to prevent lysosomal leakage (Fig. 2). Intact lysosome function will prevent the activation of multiple proinflammatory cytosolic receptors. Neutrophils exert a central role in the generation of acute lung injury (Rebetz et al. 2018) and acute pancreatitis (Murthy et al. 2019). It is thus relevant to consider that chloroquine has been reported to mediate beneficial treatment effects in a preclinical model of acute pancreatitis by reducing the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (Papayannopoulos 2018). NETs are generated when activated neutrophils release their DNA, histones, HMGB1, and intracellular granule components that together promotes inflammation and tissue damage.",

Heparin-HMGB1 complexes are unable to induce RAGE dimerization that is required for the function of RAGE (Rouhiainen et al. 2018) (Fig. 2). Heparin treatment reduced the lethality in mice exposed to LPS-HMGB1 complexes (Li et al. 2015). Since heparin treatment includes risks of causing potentially dangerous bleeding one might consider to use low-molecular heparin preparations with very low anticoagulant activity but preserved capacity to bind to HMGB1. One such heparinoid compound has been successfully tested clinically in phase I/II studies of Plasmodium falciparum malaria disease (Leitgeb et al. 2017). This molecule also prevented neutrophil-induced lung plasma leakage in a murine sepsis model (Rasmuson et al. 2019).

These receptors are expressed on alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells (Su et al. 2007). Specific \u03b17 nAChR agonist therapy decreased excess lung water, lung vascular permeability, and reduced protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage in a preclinical model of sterile acute injury. Alpha7 nAChR gene-deficient mice expressed a 2-fold increase in excess lung water and lung vascular permeability in the same model (Su et al. 2007). These results indicate that neuronal mechanisms may down-regulate pulmonary inflammation, something that might provide novel therapeutic opportunities. A link between the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system and HMGB1-induced inflammation is that RAGE-mediated endocytosis of HMGB1 complexes with other proinflammatory molecules is restrained by acetylcholine as well as \u03b17nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR)- specific agonists (Yang et al. 2019a) (Fig. 2). An analogous blockade of RAGE/HMGB1-regulated endocytosis has been demonstrated to be mediated by truncated HMGB1 box A protein, an anti-HMGB1 mAb (2G7), and dynamin inhibitors (Yang et al. 2019a).",

It also mediates anti-inflammatory functions including inhibition of HMGB1 secretion from activated macrophages (Zhang et al. 2014). Furthermore, in preclinical studies ketamine has been shown to attenuate sepsis-induced acute lung injury via a functional down-regulation of the HMGB1-RAGE pathway (Zhang et al. 2018b) (Fig. 2). Ketamine reduced the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes into the inflamed lungs, and diminished myeloperoxidase activity and the expression of HMGB1 and TLR4 (Li et al. 2016; Qin et al. 2015). Since COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS may need a long period with ventilator support, ketamine could be considered to be incorporated into the sedation protocol for these patients.",

            "text": "The highlights of the review are the following:\nThe function of HMGB1 for innate immunity is as important as MHC molecules for adaptive immunity. Each carries and presents antigens, although the systems operate in opposite directions. An MHC antigen binds its peptide intracellularly before it expresses the complex on the cell surface to be recognized by a T cell receptor. HMGB1 catches danger molecules extracellularly and brings the complexes intracellularly for destruction. However, a high intralysosomal HMGB1 concentration disrupts the lysosomal membrane allowing danger molecule access to cytosolic receptors mediating inflammation.Exaggerated host inflammatory response is a major cause of lung injury and subsequent mortality in many severe pulmonary inflammatory conditions including COVID-19. A hyperexcited HMGB1-RAGE axis can be expected in COVID-19 since necrotic respiratory epithelial cells contribute with large amounts of extracellular HMGB1, and its cognate receptor RAGE is constitutively abundantly expressed in the lungs. Once initiated, inflammation will be intensified via HMGB1 secretion from innate immunity cells causing further RAGE and TLR4 upregulation.Arterial HMGB1 levels are considerably lower than those in venous blood and we propose that this connects systemic HMGB1 biology to lung physiology. HMGB1-danger molecule complexes are transported via RAGE to the endolysosomal compartment. Proper lysosomal degradation of these complexes is mandatory for pulmonary function. Increased intralysosomal HMGB1 concentrations cause lysosomal destabilization allowing danger molecules access to potent cytoplasmic receptors causing inflammation that can be lethal.HMGB1 acts upstream of the proinflammatory cytokine cascade (Andersson et al. 2000).HMGB1 is a DNA- and RNA-binding molecule and HMGB1 has been demonstrated to function as a gene delivery agent. There is a risk that HMGB1 might attach to viral RNA and bring it to the cytosol via the RAGE-lysosomal pathway. This would implicate that there could be an additional pathway apart from the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors enabling intracellular virus replication.A substantial number of preclinical studies demonstrates that HMGB1 antagonists ameliorate severe pulmonary inflammation regardless of infectious or sterile origin. A further study of a therapeutic use of HMGB1-specific antagonists is warranted. Means to prevent HMGB1-danger molecule complexes from binding to RAGE should be sought for.",
