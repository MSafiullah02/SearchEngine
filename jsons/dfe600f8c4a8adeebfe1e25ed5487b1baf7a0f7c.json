In clinical settings, at least two repeat RT-PCR assays are performed to reduce the false-negative rate. A recent study reported that four medical professionals, aged from 30 to 36 years, still had positive RT-PCR results 5-13 days after recovery (4), which caused widespread concern. However, this phenomenon was not explained by authors. We could not determine whether it was disease relapse or not.

In this study, most patients had two consecutive negative RT-PCR test results of throat swabs before discharge but positive RT-PCR test results of rectal swabs after discharge, indicating the necessity of adding RT-PCR testing of rectal swab specimens to the criteria for discharge or discontinuation of quarantine. The current discharge criteria can be more stringent if current testing load and medical resource allowed. Previous findings showed rectal swab-testing might be more useful than throat swab-testing in determining the effect of treatment and the timing of termination of quarantine (7) .

            "text": "It was speculated that different sampling tissues may have different levels of viral nucleic acid and lasting time of virus shedding. The detection rate of specimens is limited by the level of viral nucleic acid. Viral shedding from the digestive system might be more severe and lasting longer than that from the respiratory tract. More rectal swab positives were found in a later stage of infection as compared with oral swab positives, suggesting viral shedding and transmitting through oral-fecal route (9) . In addition, intermittent virus shedding might occur in recovered patients. One patient had both negative throat and rectal swabs before hospital discharge but had positive throat swab during quarantine. Therefore, positive RT-PCR results occurred in most patients recovered from COVID-19 might not be caused by virus recurrence or second virus infection. All the patients continued to be asymptomatic and chest CT showed no changes from previous images might also support this viewpoint.",

Antibody IgG can persist a very long time (10) . Although there is no firm evidence indicating these patients would transmit the virus to others, we should be aware the potential way of transmission through the oral-faecal route (11, 12) . Patients should continue the quarantine in designated hospitals for at least 14 days and be followed up by RT-PCR assays of both throat and rectal swabs to avoid false-negative. In addition, psychological intervention is necessary for patients recovered from COVID-19 but have positive RT-PCR results again, because they may experience psychological problems including anxiety, depression, sleeplessness, and stress. The study was limited to a small number of patients with mild or moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with severe or critically ill diseases should be included for further study. Large cohort study may be needed to confirm these findings.",
