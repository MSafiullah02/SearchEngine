            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is the leading indication for liver transplantation. In the US alone, approximately 4 million people are infected, of whom 10 000 die each year as a consequence of HCV\u2010related liver disease [1]. The standard of care for treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection has evolved in a stepwise progression over the past 10 years. Interferon\u2010alpha 3 million units (MU), given through subcutaneous injection three times weekly, resulted in sustained virologic response (SVR) in 10\u201320% of patients, whereas combination interferon\u2010alpha/ribavirin achieved overall response rates approaching 30\u201340% [2, 3, 4]. Two forms of a newer, longer\u2010acting pegylated interferon\u2010alpha have provided an incremental advantage over standard interferon, and in combination with ribavirin can achieve SVRs between 40 and 80% depending on the HCV genotype [5, 6]. Despite these advances, a significant number of patients fail to respond to the current standard antiviral regimen, especially in patients with unfavourable features such as genotype 1 infection and high viral load, which were the majority of patients in the US with CHC. In the coming years, we will be facing an increasing proportion of such patients and/or treatment failures. While antiviral agents specifically targeting key enzymes of the HCV viral cycle remain under investigation, alternative agents such amantadine may represent important adjunctive treatment options, especially for the growing patient population that have failed prior anti\u2010viral therapy.",

Since this initial report, clinical studies have provided conflicting results on amantadine when used alone, in combination with interferon\u2010alpha, or with interferon\u2010alpha and ribavirin. Most studies suggest that amantadine has little impact on SVR when used alone, and produces at best a modest improvement in SVR when combined with interferon\u2010alpha or interferon\u2010alpha plus ribavirin. In this review we investigate the potential role of amanatidine, in the treatment of CHC based on results published up to end of 2003.",

This effect is mediated by inhibition of an early step in influenza A viral replication through interaction with the M2 viral membrane matrix protein, which functions as an ion channel, and is required for internalization of the virus by endocytosis [9].",

Early studies showed that amantadine reduced HCV RNA content in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells from infected patients [10], and inhibit the HCV p7 protein, a key component of ion channel formation [11]. Despite this observation, in vitro biochemical assays demonstrated that amantadine failed to inhibit key regulatory enzymes and steps of viral replication, including HCV protease, helicase, ATPase, RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase, and HCV internal ribosomal entry site translation [12]. Any effect of amantadine on HCV likely involves an immune\u2010mediated process as amantadine may induce the production of interleukins [13]. Therefore, amantadine may be best used as an adjunct to interferon and ribavirin to produce an additive or synergistic effect [14, 15]. Additional research is needed to determine if amantadine interacts with other host or viral factors, or modulates the host immune system as a basis for its antiviral effects.",

Eighty\u2010nine patients in five observational trials were treated with amantadine 200 mg daily alone for 3\u201312 months; although a biochemical response was seen in some patients, none achieved a SVR [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Six randomized trials were performed to evaluate interferon\u2010alpha and amantadine combination therapy as first\u2010line therapy. Caronia et al. [21] demonstrated in their study of 143 patients that the addition of amantadine to fixed\u2010dose IFN\u2010alpha 4.5 MU three times weekly for 12 months had no additional improvement in SVR (18% without amantadine vs 15% with amantadine). In contrast, Mangia et al. [22] found in their open\u2010label, prospective study of 200 patients that the addition of amantadine to fixed\u2010dose IFN\u2010alpha 6 MU three times weekly for 12 months resulted in a statistically significant increase of SVR from 16.8 to 29.3% (P = 0.036). A recent meta\u2010analysis of individual patient data for these six trials showed that combination interferon\u2010alpha and amantadine appears to be effective, resulting in a pooled SVR of 23.1% (P = 0.03) [23]. In this meta\u2010analysis, 481 treatment na\u00efve patients were treated with interferon and amantadine and 491 received interferon monotherapy. Baseline characteristics in favour of the interferon\u2010amantadine combination therapy over monotherapy included genotype 1 or 4 (P = 0.025), high viral load (P = 0.035), age <40 (P = 0.023), low ALT level (P = 0.007) and absent to moderate fibrosis (P = 0.007). Logistic regression analysis showed interferon\u2010amantadine combination therapy (P = 0.04) in addition to age, genotype and baseline viraemia were independent predictors of response. In the most difficult to treat group (genotype 1 or 4, high viral load), the response rate using combination therapy was 10.5%vs 4.9% in the monotherapy group (P = 0.08), but response was similar among those with favourable genotype (2 or 3) and low viral load. The most important conclusion, perhaps, was the fact that amantadine did improve the response rate of interferon in treatment na\u00efve CHC patients in this meta\u2010analysis. However, this was still below the SVR with current interferon and ribavirin combination therapy.",

For example, in the meta\u2010analysis of treatment\u2010na\u00efve patients, a sample size of 500 in each treatment arm was needed to detect the marginal increase in SVR with addition of amantadine [23]. These studies were inadequately powered to detect a small benefit from amantadine. The study by Younossi et al. [36] also has several shortcomings. Although the optimal duration of treatment with amantadine and interferon remains unknown, it is possible that the full antiviral effect of combination therapy was underestimated by the short\u2010course of treatment (24 weeks), as other studies have demonstrated that a minimum of 48 weeks of interferon is necessary to achieve sustained viral clearance in patients with genotype 1. Amantadine's antiviral effect may be mediated, in part, by unique synergistic interactions with interferon and ribavirin, and therefore may have been underestimated in trials not evaluating triple therapy. Additionally, its effect may have been underpowered by the low ribavirin dose used in this study (800 mg daily). Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that ribavirin exerts antiviral effects in a dose\u2010dependent manner, and therefore comparison with studies using higher doses cannot be made. In contrast, both the Brillanti [38] and Adinolfi [39] trials evaluated amantadine as a component of triple therapy for a full 48\u2010week course, and demonstrated impressive increases in SVR compared with the standard combination interferon\u2013ribavirin regimen. The trial by Adinolfi [39] was the best powered to address this question (114 patients), and additionally demonstrated that induction therapy with 4 weeks of daily interferon may have incremental benefit. Amantadine may have an important role as an adjunct to combination interferon\u2013ribavirin therapy in interferon nonresponders, although further prospective, randomized trials are needed to further elucidate the optimal dosing and duration, and identify predictive factors for success.",

This paucity of data is reflected in the original 1997 NIH Consensus Development Statement on Management of Hepatitis C, which did not support the routine use of interferon\u2010based therapy in patients aged over 60 years \u2018because of incomplete data\u2019 [49]. Although no formal recommendation is made in the most recent Consensus Statement in 2002, it is clear that controversy remains over the safety and efficacy of interferon\u2010based therapy in this population, and the balance between risks and benefits. Newer regimens using antiviral agents with a favourable side effect profile are needed to provide alternative options for patients in whom interferon or ribavirin may be contraindicated. Amantadine is typically well\u2010tolerated, has few side effects (nausea, lightheadedness, decreased concentration, decreased appetite and anxiety), and rarely causes more serious reactions (agitation, hallucinations, seizures) [50]. Torre et al. treated 23 consecutive treatment\u2010na\u00efve elderly patients with CHC aged over 65 (mean age 70.1) with amantadine monotherapy [20]. Although treatment was found to be safe with few side effects, amantadine failed to achieve either a sustained biochemical or virologic response.

Although the data is limited, small studies have demonstrated that combination interferon\u2010alpha and ribavirin may be effective in some patients, but is poorly tolerated in most, requiring drug reduction or withdrawal [57, 58, 59, 60]. Pilot data presented at the September 2003 American College of Gastroenterology conference suggests that pegylated interferon/ribavirin achieves high rates of sustained viral clearance in those patients who are able to complete 12 months of therapy, but treatment withdrawal occurs in nearly 50% of patients [62]. Clearly, newer regimens with better tolerated agents are needed. Andreone et al. studied nine consecutive patients with recurrent post\u2010transplantation hepatitis C infection by administering triple therapy (interferon\u2010alpha 3 MU three times weekly, ribavirin 600 mg daily, and amantadine 100 mg daily) for 12 months. Unfortunately, the treatment was very poorly tolerated, with two requiring discontinuation within the first 3 months; only one patient was able to complete 12 months of therapy. During treatment, triple therapy did significantly decrease ALT levels below baseline, but only the patient who completed treatment achieved SVR (11%). Histological improvement on liver biopsy was seen in two patients [61]. This suggests that triple therapy with amantadine in post\u2010transplant patients may result in viral clearance, but few are able to tolerate therapy for 12 months.",

This analysis showed substantial improvement of depression scores, and in the Profile of Mood States scale in the subscales fatigue (P < 0.05) and vigour (P < 0.05) among patients receiving interferon\u2010alpha and amantadine compared with those receiving interferon\u2010alpha alone [33], most likely because amantadine reduced the side\u2010effects of IFN. Previous studies have demonstrated that interferon\u2010based regimens may significantly improve quality of life scores along all subscales of the SF\u201036 survey instrument after treatment, particularly in those patients who achieved SVR. Although the mechanisms of action remain unclear, amantadine may improve quality of life by ameliorating symptoms associated with CHC infection and/or side\u2010effects of interferon therapy.",

            "text": "Our review of the published data suggested that amatadine may have a minor role in the treatment of CHC, although many issues remain unresolved. The optimal formulation and dosage of amantadine, for example, has been poorly studied. Although amantadine hydrochloride has been the primary drug form studied in research trials, several investigators have used amantadine sulphate in combination regimens. It is possible that the choice of formulation may affect treatment outcomes. In the meta\u2010analysis of interferon\u2013amantadine combination therapy in treatment na\u00efve patients, there was a significant difference in the response rate among patients who received amantadine hydrochloride instead of amantadine sulphate (P = 0.02) (64). The typical dose used in these studies ranged between 100 and 200 mg daily, although it is unknown if higher doses would result in higher efficacy. Major drawbacks of existing data include small sample sizes, widely divergent selections of patients and treatment protocols. Several studies did not stratify patients according to genotypes, a major predictor of response to interferon\u2010based therapy. This may explain some of the differences in results observed in different countries, as genotype distribution is largely regional in nature. In addition, several studies used nonstandard doses of interferon with or without induction, making comparison or pooling of data difficult. However, these studies demonstrate that amantadine is not effective as monotherapy, and poorly effective when used with interferon alone.",

The major advantage of amantadine is its favourable safety and tolerability profile and low cost. Although it is a weak antiviral agent with indirect effects on viral replication, multiple observational studies and randomized trials suggest that combination regimens with amantadine may significantly increase rates of sustained viral clearance in nonresponders, responder/relapsers, and breakthrough responders to interferon and interferon/ribavirin. In the absence of available therapies which target the HCV viral replication cycle, amantadine may represent a suitable option in the properly selected patient. Larger, randomized trials are needed to further define the role of amantadine in management of hepatitis C infection, particularly in combination with newer pegylated interferon\u2010based regimens, and in special understudied populations such as the elderly, and patients with HIV\u2010coinfection or recurrent HCV following liver transplantation.",
