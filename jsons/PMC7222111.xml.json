The one put forward by Coleman revolves around the idea of network closure, and it holds that cohesive network structures (dense connections to others who are also connected to each other) represent the essential mechanism for generating social capital, building trust and cooperation among individuals, among other benefits (Coleman 1988). On the other hand, Burt\u2019s structural hole theory posits the existence of empty spaces in social networks and non-redundant contacts, or networks held loosely together by agents connecting segments that would otherwise remain detached. Filling these holes opens up new opportunities to access knowledge and non-redundant skills, thus generating more social capital (Burt 1992).",

Granovetter (1973) argued that studying weak ties (sporadic or isolated collaborations) provides different information than that gleaned from a focus on strong ties. As applied to scientific co-authorship networks, the members of a research community with (weak) ties to members of other communities would confer an added value, facilitating information flows and innovations and serving as reference nodes for their networks (Woolcock and Deepa 2000; Putnam 2001). This vision is consistent with the concept of structural holes. However, other authors maintain that the strong ties are associated with better scientific performance, and this view is more consistent with the idea of cohesive or closure networks (Liao 2011; McFadyen et al. 2009).",

            "text": "Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998) contributed greatly to developing the network embeddedness dimensions of social capital theory, including with regard to the intensity of the ties established between network agents. These authors made a distinction between structural embeddedness, relational embeddedness, and cognitive embeddedness:Structural embeddedness refers to the pattern of connections between the analyzed agents. In scientific collaboration networks, it can be assessed using centrality indicators like betweenness or closeness, which establish the pre-eminent position of scientific agents within the overall network structure, the pattern of connections, and the possibilities and channels for accessing the rest of scientific agents therein (Borgatti 2006a; Freeman 1979; Otte and Rousseau 2002). Measuring the density of connections among individuals also provides information about the structural dimensions of the networks, which is linked to the clusters and the establishment of non-redundant ties between network members (Coleman 1988; Burt 1992).Relational embeddedness measures the breadth and intensity of the established ties and can be determined in scientific co-authorship networks based on its degree and especially by quantifying the intensity of the collaborations established. This dimension is reinforced in the presence of a strong identification with the group, trust within its membership, a perception of needing to participate in the group\u2019s activities, and recognition of and support for group norms (Wasko and Faraj 2005; Ahuja 2000; Reagans and McEvily 2003).Cognitive embeddedness involves assuming the norms and practices that characterize a given collective (e.g. a discipline or profession) and which are learned and reinforced over time and through experience and interaction among group members and professional practices. In scientific co-authorship networks, it is possible to study this dimension by identifying the length of time different agents have spent working in the field (which will affect the length of the learning and socialization period) or by determining the fields of knowledge in which they work.",

In this area, social capital mainly relies on organizational culture and can be transmitted through the firm\u2019s alliances or collaboration networks (in business, it is the institution that transmits working methods, know-how, and values when workers operate within them) (Ravasi and Schultz 2006). However, scientific knowledge and advances are more closely linked to individual researchers or scientific agents, and particularly to the research groups they participate in. These are increasingly heterogeneous and informal, and their boundaries are not determined by the institutions with which researchers are affiliated. Indeed, research groups are becoming more interdisciplinary and geographically dispersed (Adams et al. 2005; Jones et al. 2008). For that reason, it is of great interest to analyze the social capital derived from the structures formed by research groups and the role that \u201cbrokers\u201d play in connecting these groups through scientific collaboration networks. Currently, the scientific evidence on this topic is scarce. In that sense, Bozeman et al.\u2019s (2013) literature review on research collaboration, which analyzed individual-level collaborations among academic researchers, called for analyses on multiple levels, along with the study of between-level interactions and greater measurement of impact instead of output.",

We also assess the extent to which the degree of embeddedness affects both researchers\u2019 outputs and their impact. We chose the area of VAP due to its modest volume of publications (1964 documents published from 2006 to 2017 in the WoS), enabling its detailed analysis from subject-area experts on our author team. Moreover, this field presents general characteristics that are similar to those observed in many other areas of biomedical research. For example, Ramos-Rinc\u00f3n et al. (2019) have analyzed global scientific production on pneumonia from 2001 to 2015, which encompasses the area of VAP examined here. That study highlighted the steady growth in scientific production in the field; this was concentrated in the USA and Europe, although with marked incursions from China, which emerged as the second-most productive country in the most recent study period (2011\u20132015). International collaboration showed slow but steady growth, with 22% of the documents in the most recent period signed by authors from more than one country. European countries presented a higher degree of international collaboration than the USA, while North America had a higher degree of citation than Europe. The values observed for the rest of the countries studied were much lower.",

Briefly, cut-points are nodes that ensure the connectivity and global cohesiveness of the networks. The elimination of these points would cut some areas of the network off from others, increasing the number of components and reducing their size. Doreian and Fujimoto (2004), Borgatti (2006b), and Valente and Fujimoto (2010) have all used the concept of cut-point and their inherent property of connectivity to identify the relevant nodes (linking-pin, key players, bridges) that make up social networks. However, we have not identified any paper that specifically analyzes the role of cut-points in scientific co-authorship networks in more depth than a few isolated allusions to studies analyzing the existing relationship between centrality measures and scientific performance (Abbasi et al. 2011; Kumar 2015). The present study aims to fill that gap, describing the role of these researchers (cut-points) as they are related to the embeddedness dimensions and their differential characteristics relative to other authors participating in scientific co-authorship networks.",

This is evidenced by the average distance (5.22) and the high modularity (0.92) (Liu and Xia 2015; Watts and Strogatz 1998). Although the largest component includes more than half the authors (54.33%) writing on the topic, this level of integration is lower than that observed in other areas of biomedical research, where values of 70% to 95% have been observed (Gonz\u00e1lez-Alcaide et al. 2016; Vanni et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2013). This, together with the elevated index of transience (80.54%)\u2014higher in the VAP field than in areas like psoriasis (Gonz\u00e1lez-Alcaide et al. 2015), and the fact that only authors from the USA, Canada and some European countries participate in the main research sub-network, indicates some compartmentalization and dispersion in the research area analyzed. Factors that may influence this phenomenon include closer local or national ties in clinical research (Gonz\u00e1lez Alcaide et al. 2012) or the tendency of a large part of the scientific community to investigate VAP together with other topics and lines of research. Furthermore, the largest component could be considered the seat of the main activity of a research area (Kumar and Markscheffel 2016), making membership fundamental in terms of scientific performance. Our findings support this hypothesis, both in terms of productivity and in research impact, suggesting the necessity of promoting collaboration through international multicenter studies that involve as many researchers as possible, particularly in areas outside of North American and Europe (Leydesdorff and Wagner 2008). The relevance that growth in the largest component has to other aspects is also worth noting, as this can promote development of an interdisciplinary field of knowledge (Liu and Xia 2015) and translational research (Long et al. 2013a, b).",

However, the VAP community with the greatest centrality and a high level of scientific performance is made up of an international group of researchers, which highlights the relevance of promoting international collaborations. Another noteworthy finding is that some of the groups with the best scientific performance are also among the smallest. They are situated on the periphery of the main research sub-network, although with direct collaborative ties to authors and communities of reference, along with high connectivity degrees and centrality. This indicates that it is not necessary to be integrated in a large research community to achieve research excellence. Rather, researchers can investigate specific aspects of interest to the discipline, establishing sporadic collaborative ties with the mainstream investigator of the area.",

The presence of these elite actors in favored locations are thus a feature of co-authorship networks, as these small-world networks generate inequality and stratification among their nodes. Li-Chun et al. (2006) argue that the development of this elite group should not be seen as negative, as the researchers are far from closed and isolated groupings. Instead, they serve as active hubs promoting diversity, communication and integration into research communities.

While cut-points present higher intermediation values than other authors, this feature is not exclusive to them, and there is no single centrality measure that allows the precise identification of these agents. In a specific analysis of the degree of the nodes relative to the composition and cohesion of the network\u2019s giant component, Liu and Xia (2015) reported that the nodes with the highest degrees are not necessarily the bridges or hubs for establishing global connectivity. On the contrary: the giant component basically remains connected even with the removal of the high-degree nodes. Borgatti (2006b), aware that nodes with high centrality and cut-points have different properties (and that the same nodes do not necessarily have both) signaled the need to combine different criteria to identify a field\u2019s key players. These should be identified separately, as they include both the set of nodes maximally connected to all other nodes (i.e. with high centrality) and the set of nodes whose removal would result in a residual network with the least possible cohesion (cut-points).",

In our study, betweenness was the indicator with the strongest association to research performance, in terms of both productivity and impact (h-index). This association, along with the association that both degree and closeness had with research performance, was much more intense in cut-points than in other authors. These observations are concordant with those made by Cainelli et al. (2015) in a co-authorship network analysis of Italian economists. These authors concluded that a high degree of centrality (and betweenness more so than closeness) is correlated with an increase in scientific productivity, highlighting that bridges that connect two nearly separated parts of a network favor scientific productivity even more. In the area of library and information science, Li et al. (2013) and Yan and Ding (2009) also reported that centrality measures, and especially betweenness, showed significant correlations with citation counts. For their part, in the area of steel structures, Uddin et al. (2012) determined that betweenness and degree were the two centrality indicators that were most closely associated with citations in scientific co-authorship networks. The most generalized interpretation of this association is based on social capital as generated by structural holes, which would be greater in authors serving as network bridges. To varying extents, this quality is common to all cut-points (Burt 1992).",

(2015) analyzed the co-authorship networks of 68 Nobel Laureates in Physiology and Medicine between 1969 and 2011, highlighting the very different patterns followed by this group compared to others. The results suggested that having more non-redundant connections and facilitating links between different communities (brokerage style) creates better opportunities for incorporating new ideas, methods, and technologies into one\u2019s work, in short, offering a crucial advantage in terms of social capital (Burt 1992).",

            "text": "Cut-points did have an advantage in indicators associated with longer and more consolidated research careers, like the h-index. Moreover, their signatures were more likely to anchor the author lists on their papers, which is associated with the direction and supervision of research works (Avula and Avula 2015; Baerlocher et al. 2007). That fact, plus the very early dates when they first published, suggest that cut-points are often senior researchers with a long and consolidated academic trajectory, who are characterized by their broad research interests and activities. The studies investigating the reasons why these scientific agents occupy such a relevant position in their networks also point to personal factors. For example, in a longitudinal analysis of researchers in nano-science and technology, Heinze and Bauer (2007) highlighted the importance of individuals\u2019 creativity\u2014their capacity to do novel, original, and valuable work\u2014and their communication and networking skills, which allow them to connect peers and bring together groups. Liu et al. (2015) recognized the relevance of experience and time in the field, but they also held that cut-points\u2019 role is partially a function of their leadership, understood as a set of personal skills that they learn and develop over the years, for instance, the capacity to orient others\u2019 efforts towards a common goal and to their publications. Other leadership skills were the ability to acquire more information and resources, integrate these into the workflow, and interact with others; personal charisma was also a quality attributed to leaders. In their study, Kumar and Markscheffel (2016) reported that the authors with the highest centrality values were often institutional heads or directors of prominent research programs. They had frequently been awarded or otherwise recognized for their research work and belonged to associations or committees of reference in their research discipline. Our analysis of cut-points\u2019 academic status and professional careers confirms that the authors with the highest values of centrality and connectivity degree are senior researchers who serve as the heads of teaching departments, clinical units, and research groups or networks. They hold different awards accumulated over their academic and research careers. In the case of some cut-points on the periphery of the main research focus, they are characterized by a shorter and more mobile scientific career, and a more recent incorporation in their current institution. Thus, although these authors are prominent agents in their field, they are also immersed in a process of consolidating and expanding their collaboration networks and working groups.",

            "text": "Although the brokerage role predominates over cohesion among cut-points, in consonance with Gonz\u00e1lez-Brambila\u2019s (2013) conclusions about the effect embeddedness has on research output and citation, our results provide more detail on this point. Moreover, we note that this situation is inverted among the rest of the authors in the main research sub-network, among whom cohesion and relational embeddedness are more pronounced than the structural dimension. Thus, one of the most significant results of the present study is that the cut-points are researchers who have the positive features associated with both the main theories on social capital. On the one hand, they enable interconnections between different communities and groups (thanks to their role in plugging the structural holes). On the other, they also present a high degree of cohesion when analyzing the individual ties that they establish with different communities in which they participate. In this way, they can also take advantage of the benefits of their participation in these cohesive structures and in the relational dimension. Thus, the cut-point figure would respond to the ego-network typology of complex structures, described by Rumsey-Wairepo (2006) and Kuzhabekova (2011). The fact that the cut-points\u2019 ego networks presented very heterogeneous structures probably reflects differences within the brokerage styles and research collaboration patterns of this group. The literature describes several concepts related to specific differential features or properties of some nodes, which permit network connectivity (Long et al. 2013c). These concepts can frame a more precise analysis of the role played by cut-points or brokers (as generic concepts) in favoring the interconnection between different research communities:The concept of bridge is understood as a node that acts as an intermediary for contacts with another community (nodes that participate in 1:1 relationships to bridge the structural hole between two clusters). This concept points to the relevance of the notion of weak ties proposed by Granovetter (Valente and Fujimoto 2010), which could arise from incipient contacts between researchers or sporadic ties nested within a research project, among other origins. This would be the case of some of the peripheral research communities identified in the present study, for example, the communities of S. Nseir, L. Papazian, L. Berra, and A. Armaganidis. These cut-points present the lowest clustering coefficients among all the cut-points, while their communities show the lowest densities. Such findings are consistent with the characteristics of newer research communities.The concept of gatekeeper, on the other hand, refers to the control of information exercised by some nodes (Cranefield and Yoong 2013). For example, 1:N relationships bridge the structural hole between the cut-point\u2019s cluster and an outside community. These nodes have the capacity to decide which information to share or use in their community from all the multiple contacts that they have established with researchers from other communities. M.H. Kollef exemplifies the figure of gatekeeper in our study, a role linked with Burt\u2019s notion of exploiting the advantageous position in the network through structural holes (Burt 1992). However, it would be an over interpretation to conclude that gatekeepers reach this position deliberately. Rather, it could be the natural result of working skills or styles that differ from those of other researchers, allowing them to act as leaders and coordinators, to identify new lines of work, to serve as mediators for resolving conflicts, or to integrate specialized information that comes to their attention from different sources (Gray 2008; Wagner et al. 2015).A structural fold would be a node that functions as a common agent in two overlapping or cohesive structures (Vedres and Stark 2010), through N:N relationships. In our study, these cut-points would include M. Klompas, B. Allaouchiche, L. Bouadma, and A. Torres, who all participate in highly dense communities. The simplest interpretation explaining this pattern would be that these investigators simultaneously participate in two or more groups or lines of research.Finally, boundary spanners are the most difficult to identify, as this would require additional information from that available based on co-authorships alone. These nodes would bridge the structural hole between two clusters that, for one reason or another, are separated by a conceptual boundary (Tushman 1977). In our study, the cut-points with this role would be those connecting authors from different institutions or countries (J. Chastre, M.H. Kollef, J. Rello, and M. Wolff), but other aspects could also be considered under this rubric, for example cut-points that link different disciplines, specialties, research approaches, etc., with the essential role of fostering innovation and knowledge translation (Long et al. 2013c).",

Notable characteristics are their higher scientific production and h-index. Moreover, although their role in filling structural holes is predominant, many of these authors also present a high degree of cohesion. Given the above, and to the extent that they integrate the two main mechanisms of generating social capital described in the literature, cut-points can be considered key players whose role is an essential impetus in research and the cognitive institutionalization of a discipline. Some cut-points situated on the periphery of the giant component may emerge later as key actors/players, as long as they maintain and increase their roles of connectivity, their social capital in filling structural holes, and at the same time their participation in different cohesive network structures. In network analysis, it is important to differentiate between authors who serve as cut-points and other researchers in the network (for example, those who stand out only as central actors in measures like intermediation, degree, and closeness) or who merely play a brokerage role or participate in cohesive structures.",
