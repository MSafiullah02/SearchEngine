These interactions enable RNA polymerase from transcribing the related gene to produce mRNA which in turn is translated to a specific protein. Identifying such sequences is important to understand the mechanism of regulating gene expression. The occurrences of regulatory elements are highly influenced by common features such as GC-content [1], di-nucleotide profile [2], and codon bias [3,4]. Thus, identifying over/under-represented regulatory elements or genome-scale patterns relies on generating random sequences that obey the pre-specified amino acid sequence and GC-content constraints.",

FaBox is used to construct random DNA sequences with a predefined nucleotide composition. GenRGenS creates random sequences with several models, such as Markov chains, hidden Markov models, weighted context-free grammars, and others. The sequences generated by GenRGenS are essentially used for structural motif evaluation.

Thus, for a particular protein sequence of length n, we have to test at most 6n coding sequences to find those satisfying the desired amino acid sequence and GC-content constraints. That is, the time complexity is exponential with respect to the length of amino acid sequence. Currently, there are two solutions to solve this problem, multinomial [8,9] and NullSeq [10]. Multinomial method chooses the synonymous codon C of amino acid a with probability P\na( \nC\n ) given the nucleotide composition. The probability P\na( \nC\n ) is computed as a normalized product of probability distribution of the individual nucleotides within the codon C. As shown in [10], the multinomial method generates unbiased coding sequences. A more restricted method was presented recently, which the authors named NullSeq. NullSeq [10] uses the maximum entropy approach where the synonymous codon usage probability is derived from a strict function that expresses the expected GC-content in the reference amino acid sequence. However, majority of the resulting coding sequences defy the GC-content constraints.",

Backtracking is more efficient than the exhaustive search when there is a very large search space where not all combinations of raw components are inspected. This technique is similar to tree depth-first search and depends on adding one component to the candidate solution at a time. Where, as soon as a violation for constraints is detected, the algorithm discards the current solution and backtracks to the parent to seek another candidate solution, see e.g., [11]. Since the reference amino acid sequence is long, it is infeasible to apply the backtracking approach directly. This is because a very large amount of memory will be required to generate the coding sequences. For tackling this problem, we devised a trick to permute the indices of the reference amino acid sequence. Thus, random sets are selected without interferences and backtracked to produce coding sequences with a random distribution for the GC-content over the whole sequence, Fig. 1\ndepicts our methodology.",

Assuming \u03c6 is the GC-content of P^, then the problem is to generate a random set of synonymous coding sequences each of \u03c6 GC-content which in turn could be translated to P. Let \u03a6 be the set of indices of P, where \u03a6 = {0, 1,  \u2026 , \nn \u2212 1}. By maintaining the set of indices, amino acids within the reference amino acid sequence can be accessed easily. According to the proposed methodology in Fig. 1, \u03a6 is divided into smaller subsets each of size s, with the last subset being a fraction of s. Thus, the total number of subsets \u0393 = \u2308n/s\u2309. Each subset G\ni is constructed by randomly selecting n indices, where the subsets are disjoint. In other words, the constructed subsets must satisfy three conditions. First, the union of all constructed subsets equals \u03a6, which is the set of indices of reference amino acid sequence P (Eq.

The worst case is that when all the indices in the subset are pointing to Leucine, Serine, or Arginine. In this case, the search space will be large, 60,466,176 coding subsequences. But, with backtracking and GC-content constraint, this large search space will be pruned to about 100,000, which is feasible for memory limitations. With more complicated constraints such as nucleotide composition, this search space will be further pruned to about 10,000. Our algorithm reads amino acid sequence symbols one by one from left to right and is checked each time the amino acid is replaced with the corresponding codon synonyms and the GC-content constraint. If the total GC-content so far for subset G\ni is greater than C\ni and the end of sequence is not reached, the current path is discarded and the algorithm backtracks to find a more promising path. Fig. 2\nillustrates the backtracking with a tree of height s + 1. The nodes at level 2 represent the codons of the first amino acid in the subset and the variable C^i refers to the GC-content so far, where each node has its own C^i that accumulates the GC-content of the path from the second level to the node. Algorithms 1 and 2 further elaborate our method. Note that the total GC-content of all subsets equal \u03c6.",

This was tested by dividing the complete sequence into subsets and then computing the GC-contents for all subsets. Thus, standard deviation (STD) and average (Avg) are computed for each generated sequence. Finally, a range is computed over 1000 random coding sequences. The same experiment was repeated for 1000 random coding sequences generated by NullSeq. Table 3\nlists the ranges of STD and Avg for both tools over 1000 generated coding sequences in addition to the STD and Avg for the reference coding sequences. Since it is a single reference coding sequence for each protein, no ranges are shown. Smaller STD means that all subsets have similar GC-content and larger STD means that GC-content is non-uniformly distributed over subsets. Thus, larger STD and Avg ranges means that a diversity of random sequences are produced. Both tools generate sequences with a good STD and Avg ranges. However, random sequences by NullSeq originally have GC-content smaller or greater than targeted GC-contents which cause the ranges of STD and Avg for subsets GC-content to be a bit larger.",
