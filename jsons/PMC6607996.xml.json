Several functionally distinct subsets of CD8+ T cells have been defined. Traditional Tc1 and Tc2 CD8+ T cells play overlapping and different roles in tumor immunity [1], viral infection [2], and some allergic diseases [3]. Tc17 cells can be generated in vitro and in vivo and exert critical functions in tumor rejection and viral clearance [4, 5]. CD8+ Tregs play an important role in maintaining immune self\u2010homeostasis and resistance to autoimmune diseases. CD8+CD122+ Tregs prevent and cure na\u00efve CD4+ T cell\u2010induced IBD [6]. Moreover, transferring CD8+CD28\u2212 T cells into CD8\u2010deficient mice can suppress development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [7]. CD8+ IL\u201010\u2010producing T cells were found in several murine disease models, including coronavirus\u2010induced encephalitis [8], acute influenza virus infection [9], and Salmonella and Leishmania infection [10]. Also, they were found in human HIV\u20101 infection [11] and chronic hepatitis C virus infection [12].",

Recent reports have demonstrated that IL\u201010 is indispensable for Treg function [14] and suppresses proinflammatory T cell immunity [15]. Several groups, including us, have established that IL\u201010 is critical for maintaining the suppressive function of Tregs in arthritis [16] and colitis [17]. IL\u201010 suppresses TNF\u2010\u03b1 production by macrophages [18], Th1 cell cytokine production, and T cell proliferation [19]. IL\u201010 restrains Th17 cell\u2010mediated pathology [20] and CD45RBlo cell\u2010mediated colitis [21]. Although Tregs [13] and type 1 Treg [22], macrophages [13], and various immune cells were found to be important sources of IL\u201010, the function of IL\u201010+CD8+ T cells in inflammation remains to be investigated.",

Several transcription factors have been found to regulate IL\u201010 expression through different mechanisms in macrophages or monocytes. c\u2010Maf [25], stat1 [26], and stat3 [27] have been reported to be involved in IL\u201010 transcription regulation in the LPS signal transduction pathway, whereas Sp1 [28] or Sp3 [28] directly binds to some specific motifs of the IL\u201010 promoter to alter IL\u201010 mRNA levels.

We demonstrated that IL\u20104 induced a significantly higher number of GFP+CD8+ T cells under Con A and anti\u2010CD3 conditions (Fig. 1A). In our preliminary studies, this effect was IL\u20104 dose\u2010dependent (data not shown). The induction of IL\u201010 by IL\u20104 was independent of IFN\u2010\u03b3 (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, using CD8+ T cells from 10BiT.OT\u20101 transgenic mice, in which Thy1.1 expression is used to indicate IL\u201010 gene expression, we determined that IL\u20104 also induced antigen\u2010responding IL\u201010 production by CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1C). To confirm the correlation between GFP and IL\u201010 expression level, GFP+ and GFP\u2212CD8+ T cells were sorted from the culture, and the expression level of IL\u201010 was analyzed by real\u2010time PCR. Indeed, GFP+CD8+ T cells expressed a significantly higher level of IL\u201010 (Fig. 1D), which was confirmed further by detection of IL\u201010 protein levels using ELISA (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, under the same culture conditions, CD4+ T cells expressed a significantly lower level of IL\u201010 (Fig. 1F), and these two reporter mice (tiger and 10BiT) showed similar results. Therefore, both of these reporter mice were used in our following studies. Our results present new evidence that CD8+ T cells could be induced to produce IL\u201010 by IL\u20104 upon activation.",

The proliferation of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells in the presence of Thy1.1+CD8+T cells were overlaid with those cultured with Thy1.1\u2212CD8+ T cells. Indeed, Thy1.1+ CD8+ T cells dramatically suppressed proliferation of CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, addition of an anti\u2010IL\u201010R antibody blocked the suppression (Fig. 3B). The suppression effect was also impaired when using CD4+ T cells isolated from CD4dnIL\u201010R\u03b1 mice [21], in which CD4+ T cells express a high level of IL\u201010R but without the cytoplasmic domain for signaling through these receptors as the responders (Fig. 3C).

Similar to CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells have divergent, functional subsets, according to their cytokine profiles, including Tc1, Tc2, Tc17, and Tregs [43, 44]. However, less attention has been paid to the study of differentiation and transcriptional\u2010controlling mechanisms of CD8+ Tregs. In this study, we observed that CD8+ T cells were induced to produce IL\u201010 by IL\u20104 and controlled by the cell cycle regulatory protein Cdkn2a.",

It has also been reported that together with IL\u201012, IL\u20104 also induces IL\u201010 production by CD8+ T cells [47]. Interestingly, we demonstrated that together with IL\u20102, IL\u20104 was sufficient to induce na\u00efve CD8+ T cells to differentiate into IL\u201010\u2010producing cells (Fig. 1). Either IL\u20102 alone or IL\u20104 alone failed to induce significant levels of IL\u201010 (data not shown). In our preliminary experiments, cells cultured in the absence of IL\u20102 failed to survive and grow. We therefore speculated that IL\u20102 served as the growth and surviving factor in our system, and IL\u20104 played a critical role in inducing IL\u201010 production by CD8+ T cells. Also, this process was dependent on TCR signaling\u2010mediated activation, as even cytokine alone in the absence of T cell activation could lead to cell death (data not shown). Furthermore, this process was not affected by the presence of endogenous IFN\u2010\u03b3, as neutralizing IFN\u2010\u03b3 did not change the expression level of IL\u201010 (Fig. 1). Our results thus provide an additional pathway for inducing IL\u201010 production by CD8+ T cells.",

Although quite a few signaling factors were up\u2010regulated upon IL\u20104 treatment, only knockdown of cdkn2a and blimp1 suppressed IL\u201010 expression significantly (Fig. 4), and it was evident that these two pathways had no direct interaction (Fig. 4). The critical role of Cdkn2a was confirmed further using Cdkn2a\u2212/\u2212 mice, and the effect was restricted to CD8+ T cells but was not identified in CD4+ T cells or APCs (Fig. 5). Interestingly, knockdown of gata3 failed to affect IL\u20104\u2010induced IL\u201010 expression (Fig. 4), implying that Cdkn2a is not downstream of GATA3. It is unclear whether Cdkn2a is downstream of phosphorylated Stat6 or directly downstream of TCR signaling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to define the role of this cell cycle regulatory protein in CD8+ T cell differentiation, and further studies are required to explore the function of Cdkn2a in other cytokine\u2010induced differentiation of CD8+ T cells and their detailed signaling pathways.",

Recently, several reporter mice have been made to use GFP or Thy1.1 to indicate IL\u201010\u2010expressing cells, such as tiger mice [10] and 10BiT mice [35]. By taking advantage of IL\u201010 GFP or Thy1.1 reporter mice, we demonstrated that IL\u201010\u2010producing CD8+ T cells possessed a strong, suppressive function in vitro via IL\u201010\u2010 and cell contact\u2010dependent mechanisms (Fig. 3) and in vivo through suppressing IFN\u2010\u03b3 production (Fig. 6). Interestingly, these IL\u20104\u2010induced, IL\u201010\u2010producing CD8+ T cells expressed suppressing molecules (PD\u20101, CTLA\u20104), as well as a high level of Tc2 cytokines (Fig. 2). Several subsets of CD8+ Tregs have been identified, such as CD8+CD122+ Tregs [6], CD8+CD28\u2212 T cells [7], and Qa\u20101\u2010restricted CD8+ T cells [48]. It is interesting to define whether this population of IL\u201010\u2010producing CD8+ T cells is a new subset of CD8+ Tregs. Further validation would be needed to study the gene expression profiles and functions of these IL\u20104\u2010induced, IL\u201010\u2010producing CD8+ T cells.",

Mice were transferred with GFP+CD8+ (1\u00d7106 cells/mouse), GFP\u2212CD8+ (1\u00d7106 cells/mouse), or PBS vehicle through i.v. injection at 24 h prior to and 24 h post\u2010TNBS administration. Mice treated with 50% ethanol were used as negative control. (A) Mice were weighed daily after treatment for 5 days. One representative of three experiments was shown (mean+sem; *P<0.05;**P<0.01). (B and C) Mice were killed at Day 5 post\u2010TNBS induction. Colon tissues from four groups of mice were fixed for H&E staining to determine disease severity. Representative sections were shown in B, and histopathological scores were shown in C (mean\u00b1sem; ***P<0.001). Tissue sections were observed by Leica DM3000, and photos were obtained by the Leica Application Suite V3 software. Data were representative of three independent experiments (original magnification, \u00d7200; original scale bars=100 \u03bcm). (D) Colon lengths were compared among different groups at Day 5 after treatment. One representative experiment of three was shown (mean+sem; **P<0.01).
