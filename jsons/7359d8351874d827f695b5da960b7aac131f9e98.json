Nowadays, continuous development of the social economy, which has dramatically changed people's daily diets, has been sharply increasing the incidence of diabetes worldwide (Ottmani et al. 2010) . At the same time, the TB epidemic has experienced a resurgence, especially in developing countries in the past two decades, thus resulting in the increased incidence of the combination of these two diseases (Hassani et al. 2005) . The two diseases interact to cause additional clinical problems, and this has become a new challenge in TB control (Dooley and Chaisson 2009).",

Electronic microscopy (EM) studies show that white blood cells of diabetics exhibit less protrusion and deformation, reduced phagocytosis and lysosomal functions, and that cytoplasmic organelles are rarely seen. The lower functional ability of alveolar macrophages in diabetics provides more favorable conditions for the replication of TB pathogen, thus increasing TB susceptibility in diabetic patients. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of TB patients with diabetes, alveolar macrophages and their H 2 O 2 production are both significantly lower than normal. These factors are negatively correlated to the range of lung lesions and the bacteria quantity in sputum.",

If there are no symptoms of high blood sugar, then one of these criteria (FPG, OGTT, or non-fasting plasma glucose levels) should be checked again.

Lung wet rale occurs if there are extensive lesions or combined infections. Often, chest X-rays show that saturated, exudated, or cheese-like lesions are most common and they are easily fused, forming cavities and spreading in the bronchus. The lesion sites are not only at the common preferred site of TB but all over the lung lobes as well. The rate of lower lung lobe lesions of TB is higher in TB/diabetic patients than the patients who have TB alone. Cavity formation is more common in TB/diabetic patients, and fluid levels can occur within the hollow region (P\u00e9rez-Guzm\u00e1n et al. 2000 . In addition, the rate of lower lung lobe lesions of TB and cavity formation will increase as the years progress. The sputum smear-positive ratio is higher in TB/diabetic patients than those without diabetes mellitus and there are more drugresistant (DR) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) patients in the former group (Bashar et al. 2001; Subhash et al. 2003) .",

Generally speaking, it takes 1-1.5 years to complete a whole course of treatment for TB, which is longer than for patients with pulmonary TB alone. If drug-resistant TB is confirmed, an even longer course is required with the appropriate drugs according to drug susceptibility testing. Some scholars believe that short-course chemotherapy programs are also appropriate for concurrent treatment of these two diseases. Studies have shown that the sputum conversion rate of new smear-positive patients after 6 months treatment could reach 94 %. Sputum conversion can fail when the patient is older than 45, has a high pretreatment smear grade, and/or has lung field lesions in more than two lung lobes (Banu Rekha et al. 2007 ). At present, there has not been a randomized controlled study of multicentered large numbers of samples, and there is no standard program indicating the specific time for the course of treatment. It is thought that blood glucose control is the key point for treatment in the patients with both TB and diabetes. If patients' blood glucose control is good to excellent, their sputum conversion rate after both 2 months and after 6 months of treatment will be higher than those whose blood glucose is poorly controlled (Zeng et al. 2006) . But there are different views ). The recurrence rate of pulmonary TB combined with diabetes is higher than that of nondiabetics, especially for the patients with poor glucose control.",

It aims to maintain blood sugar within a standard safety range and to avoid or reduce the incidence of complications. Specific measures could refer to the diabetes-related treatment guidelines. The TB patients' physical status is in chronic consumption, so they require a reasonable calorie intake. High-quality protein should be the main source, which, along with increased intake of both vitamins and dietary fiber, could improve in TB site repairing. Patients with hypoalbuminemia should take special care to increase their protein intake. In addition to the daily calories required (calculated according to patient body weight and activity), appropriate additional energy could be added by increasing carbohydrates to up to 45-60 % of the total calories consumed (Chinese Diabetes Society, China Medicine Doctor Association Nutrition Doctor Specialized Committee 2015). Some studies have shown that the plasma concentration of anti-TB drugs in TB patients with diabetes may be reduced, thus reducing the effectiveness of TB treatment (Nijland et al. 2006; Ruslami et al. 2010) . Anti-TB drugs can impact diabetes. INH can interfere with the normal glucose metabolism, increasing sugar in urine and blood and increasing peripheral neuritis as well. RIF is a liver enzyme inducer, which could accelerate the metabolism of sulfonylurea and shorten its half-life, weakening its hypoglycemic effect. Aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones are harmful to the kidneys. Ethambutol can cause optic neuritis. These drugs should be used with caution in the clinic and patients should be monitored.",

TB progression is correlated with macrophages (the effector cells) and T cells (the reactive cells) of the cellular immune system. Silica dust has a cytotoxic effect on lung macrophages, causing metabolic damage to pulmonary macrophages and leading to macrophage necrosis. It was recently found that there is surfactant-associated protein A (SP-A) in silicosis bronchial washing fluid (Lesur et al. 1993) . SP-A can activate alveolar macrophages and inhibit the formation of free nitrogen, making patients susceptible to M. tuberculosis (Samten et al. 2008 ). In addition, M. tuberculosis may escape from macrophage phagocytosis by going into the silica nodules. Activated macrophages can swallow silica very quickly and then the cell's own lysosomes release and collapse. The cell dies quickly, releasing many materials that could stimulate fibroblasts. As a result, pulmonary capillary beds and the lymphatic system can be seriously damaged, with blood vessel walls thickened and deformed. The lumen can narrow or become occluded, reducing blood circulation to the lungs. The reduced blood supply weakens the lung tissue's resistance to TB bacteria. Pulmonary lymphatic system fibrosis can prevent the lymphatic system from resisting M. tuberculosis invasion.",

Therefore, the main program for silicon TB treatment is the same as standard TB control treatment: a three-or four anti-TB drug chemotherapy program is adopted, including INH, RIF, PZA, EMB, SM, and so on, with a 3-month initial phase followed by a 6-month continuation phase (3HRZE(S)/6HR). In cases of MDR-TB, an individualized program of chemotherapy combined with silicosis treatment should be mapped out based on the patient's medication history and TB drug sensitivity results. About 4-5 drugs can be used together with at least 2-3 kinds of sensitive drugs, with the whole course of treatment lasting 18-24 months. The program performs well in the local clinic.

S. aureus infection shows multiple pulmonary infiltrates or lobar segment inflammatory changes. It begins as flocculent shadows, then its density increases, appearing as translucent honeycomb areas or cavities. Then, one or more pneumatoceles appear around the shadow of the inflammation area which could increase or disappear rapidly in a short time, accompanied by pleural effusion or pneumothorax. For the blood-borne infected patient, mass slice or bulk-like shadow is distributed at both sides, and cavities are easily formed. Early infection of K. pneumoniae appears lobularly invasive, then rapidly expands to large-lobe consolidation, with irregular translucent areas. Curved bulging often appears in the fissure of the lobe (lobe bulging sign) because of its thick and heavy exudate. In H. influenzae infected cases, 75 % showed changes characteristic of bronchial pneumonia, and the other 25 % appeared lobular or with segmented opaque shadows. The P. aeruginosa infected lung has widespread nodular and patchy shadows, mainly in the lower lung, and there are multiple small abscesses, which can merge together with each other to form a large, consolidated shadow. M. pneumoniae infection can be found in diverse forms, with a vague, feathery, or uniform shadow. In general, a shadow close to the lung hila is thick, gradually fading along the lung lobes with an obscure edge. The lesions are movable, but a few shadows are patchy and slice-liked. Rickettsial infection has a patchy shadow or an emerging consolidating shadow with uneven density. Its distribution is segmental or lobular, associated with a small amount of pleural effusion. A feature of pulmonary aspergillosis is that aspergillomata can move with a change in body position when performing the chest imaging test.",

From day 10 to day 20, the lesion develops to a half-moon shaped translucent zone (air half sign, caused by coagulation necrosis and pulmonary embolism) and it can deteriorate to complete necrosis cavity, most of which is single onset. The lesion sizes are variable and the distribution has no obvious features. Drugs for treatment could involve voriconazole, itraconazole, caspofungin, or micafungin, and two of them can be combined if necessary. Imaging of pulmonary cryptococcosis often has nodules or mass shadow under pleural in unilateral or bilateral lung fields, and can be single or multiple onset, with a diameter of l-10 cm and smooth edges or fuzzy or with small burrs. Often, there is a cavity formed, and the wall is relatively smooth with uniform and very neat low-density shadow in the nodular shadow image. It is very important in pulmonary cryptococcosis diagnosis to note the presence of nodules or masses with smooth low-density necrosis areas or cavities, especially in multiple appearances which is usually what happens in patients with healthy immune systems. In contrast, the main progression in the immunocompromised host shows parenchymal infiltration, which is hard to distinguish from pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Amphotericin B and flucytosine can be used together or fluconazole can be used for treatment, with the treatment course lasting from 8 weeks to 6 months. Itraconazole could be used orally for patients who are not coinfected with meningitis. In pulmonary mucormycosis cases, the important symptoms for diagnosis are hemoptysis and chest pain with no other signs. Its early imaging shows bronchial pneumonia, with rapid integration into a large consolidation. This is often seen with a formed cavity and a wedge-shaped shadow which can be seen at the bottom near the pleura (if there is a large pulmonary vessel embolism). This is valuable for diagnosis. Currently, amphotericin B is the most effective medicine in the clinic (the dose is 0.5-1.5 mg/kg/day, with the total amount of 2.5-3.0 g for the course of treatment).

The direct reason for respiratory failure is that the body cannot maintain effective gas exchange. Respiratory failure is defined when the patient, at rest and breathing air at sea level pressure, has arterial oxygen pressure (PaO 2 ) lower than 8 kPa (<60 mmHg), with or without carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO 2 ) higher than 6.67 kPa (50 mmHg). There is always a process as respiratory failure develops, especially for chronic respiratory failure. Respiratory function may be reduced gradually. If the external respiratory dysfunction causes elevated PaCO 2 or decreased PaO 2 and does not reach the standards above, or at rest blood gas values are normal with no obvious clinical symptoms, but PaO 2 decreases apparently or PaCO 2 increases only if physical load increases, this state is often called respiratory insufficiency. Once pulmonary TB with concurrent (chronic) respiratory failure is exacerbated acutely by other factors, coma, shock, and life-threatening can occur. As it is reported, 93 % of the patients who died of pulmonary TB with respiratory failure died in transit to the ICU (Lee et al. 2003) . The main principles for treatment of TB combined with respiratory failure include keeping the respiratory tract unobstructed, correcting hypoxia and reducing carbon dioxide retention, correcting acid-base imbalances and electrolyte disturbance, initiating/continuing anti-TB therapy, treating inducing factors, preventing complications, and supporting good nutrition.",

Mechanical ventilation may cause the spread of pulmonary TB, making treatment more difficult. Studies have shown that among patients using mechanical ventilation for pulmonary TB combined with respiratory failure, the mortality rate is up to 60 %, which is similar to ARDS and twice that of pneumonia caused by respiratory failure (Lee et al. 2003; Rollas et al. 2015) . Therefore, it is necessary to explore a set of effective strategies and programs to guide the application of mechanical ventilation in the treatment of pulmonary TB with respiratory failure. Mechanical ventilation can be either invasive or, if external, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). Many scholars have suggested using a flexible selection scheme: for patients with respiratory failure who have no contraindications for NPPV, NPPV can be implemented and, according to patient response, continued or halted in favor of invasive ventilation. The key point of using this strategy is rationally to master the indications of NPPV and invasive ventilation as well as when to change from NPPV to invasive ventilation. NPPV is widely used clinically because it doesn't require intubation or incision and thus avoids complications of artificial airways. NPPV can also reduce the need for sedatives, as it does not affect normal swallowing, eating, or talking. It can help to preserve the air temperature and humidity of the lungs and minimize coughing. It can also be used intermittently and patients can be taken offline easily. The clinical effectiveness of NPPV should be evaluated 1-2 h after treatment. Signs of clinical improvement include a PaCO 2 decrease > 16 %, pH > 7.30, and an oxygenation index > 164 mmHg. There are always a certain percentage of failures for NPPV treatment. Therefore, for patients with no improvement after NPPV treatment and who have indications of endotracheal intubation, prompt emergency intubation must be considered. Additionally, in the case of irritability or loss of consciousness, inability to clear secretions or tolerate the connection method, hemodynamic instability, oxygenation deterioration, or increase in carbon dioxide retention, intubation should be done as soon as possible.",

In addition, TB bronchiectasis and pleural thickening are often combined. Most of these patients are elderly and may have TB-associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary heart disease, and so on. There are several reasons for respiratory failure, not only pump failure, such as thorax, pleural changes, respiratory muscle fatigue, but also lung failure such as airway obstruction, lung tissue lesions, and pulmonary circulation disorders. Mechanisms of respiratory failure include both restrictive hypoventilation and obstructive hypoventilation. There is not only an increase in the functional shunt induced by part of the pulmonary alveoli hypoventilation, but there is also an increase in functional dead space due to the induction of pulmonary alveoli blood hypoperfusion. Both diffusion impairment and anatomic shunt increase. Therefore, such patients usually have both disturbed ventilation and ventilatory disorders, showing type II respiratory failure, chronic respiratory failure, acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure, and so on.

Treatments of pathogens vary according to their different basic diseases, different risk factors, and different pathogenic microorganisms. Moreover, treatment of basic diseases is also very important. For the patient with respiratory failure caused by severe TB who has bronchial pulmonary structural damage, strong anti-TB treatment at an early stage can effectively prevent spread in mechanical ventilation. This could directly impact the prognosis of patients. Goals for the TB patient with COPD are mainly for the treatment of chronic airflow obstruction, reduction of airway inflammation, and increase of secretions from the airway. For the patient with combined bronchial asthma, the key point is asthma control.",

Application of \u03b2 blockers and antiarrhythmic drugs is avoided for arrhythmia. Drugs which could impair liver function are avoided, so as not to affect the normal application of anti-TB drugs. Complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, shock, and DIC should be treated immediately. A key way to prevent multiple organ failure is to master the right time and method of oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation to improve ventilation and avoid hypoxia. It is important to determine and treat hypotension promptly to avoid organ hypoperfusion. Also, note that TB is a chronic wasting disease. TB patients with respiratory failure can easily develop anemia, which should be corrected in order to improve blood capacity for oxygen and increasing the oxygen supply.",

            "text": "The majority of pulmonary TB patients are malnourished, which can make active TB progress and worsen. Protein-energy malnutrition (usually manifested as marasmic kwashiorkor type) affects the structure and function of the respiratory muscle, reduces ventilatory drive capability, and seriously affects the body's immune defenses. This has a negative impact on prognosis; TB is recurrent and hard to heal. In the early stage, nonprotein calories should be low, which may be increased to 30-35 kcal kg \u22121 d \u22121 after the situation is stable. For some patients with severe malnutrition problems who can not be offline, calories should be increased according to the patient tolerance to correct hypoproteinemia and malnutrition. The minimum ratio of glucose and fat calories is 50:50, the ratio of calories and protein should be 100 to 150:1, the protein intake should be 1.5-2.0 g kg \u22121 d \u22121 (Tayek 2002; Kreymann et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2011; Grau Carmona et al. 2011; Elke et al. 2014) Vitamins and trace elements should be added to balance the electrolytes with special attention to the elements which could affect respiratory muscle function (such as potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus). Because of gastrointestinal disorders and anorexia, TB patients have reduced nutrient intake, resulting in an anabolic reduction. Meanwhile, M. tuberculosis will use the body's protein for its metabolism, causing fever, night sweats, weight loss, and other consumable changes, and leading to increased catabolism, decreased fat storage, and loss of lean body mass. When the body temperature increases 1 \u00b0C, metabolic rate will increase 13 % (Tan and Li 2000) . Nitrogen and amino acids could get lost from sweat. Therefore, TB patients have a relatively higher catabolism rate, and their energy consumption is higher than that of healthy people. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) could increase 50-150 %. In severe stress, the catabolism rate is significantly higher than the anabolism rate, resulting in increased protein loss and muscle tissue loss. This causes skeletal muscle atrophy and negative nitrogen balance, causing hypoproteinemia and decreases immune function, which increases the infection rate and mortality. Glycometabolism is another metabolic disorder when the body is suffering stress.",

Cultured results respiratory tract specimens are positive for M. pneumoniae, C.pneumoniae, or Legionella pneumophila. 4. Serum antibody titers of serum M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, or L. pneumophila change (increase or decrease) four or more times; at the same time, M. pneumoniae antibody titers (complement fixation test result) are \u22651:64, pneumonia antibody titers (micro-immunofluorescence test) are \u2265l:32, or L. pneumophila antibody titers (indirect fluorescent antibody method) are \u22651:128. 5. Urinary antigen test of L. pneumophila (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is positive. 6. Antibody titers to serum influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus change (increase or decrease) four or more times over multiple samples. 7. A urinary antigen test is positive for S. pneumoniae (via immunochromatography, except in children).Prompt Etiological Diagnosis 1. The dominant bacteria cultured from qualified sputum specimen with slow growth (\u226510 6 cfu/mL). 2. There is a small amount of bacteria growing in the sputum specimen, and it is consistent with the smear microscopy examination result (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis). 3. The same bacteria are cultured repeatedly in separate samples within 3 days. 4. The serum C. pneumoniae IgG antibody titer is \u22651:512 or the IgM antibody titer is \u22651:16 (micro-immunofluorescence test). 5. The serum L. pneumophila antibody titer is \u22651:320 (tube agglutination test) or the IgG antibody titer is \u22651:1024 (indirect fluorescent antibody test).",
