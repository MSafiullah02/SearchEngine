With the COVID-19 pandemic, Refugees encounter several difficulties: adapting to the language while trying to obtain reliable information; the unhealthy spaces in which they live, overcrowded, without access to water, basic sanitation, food are also factors that aggravate their condition. Lack of human resources due to quarantine and the lack of infrastructure of support agencies in countries that have received refugees also mitigates assistance. \uf0b7 All of these factors associated with fear and uncertainties about the future are consistent risk factors for an increase in cases of COVID-19 infection as well as psychiatric illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",

Therefore, we aimed to describe the factors that can worsen the mental health of refugees. The first difficulty faced by refugees is language and access to information. According to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), digital platforms are useful for sharing quality information and keeping contact with local representatives and groups of refugees (UNHCR, 2020a). The great challenge is to screen information on prevention and health promotion about COVID-19 and to adapt them to the routines of thousands of families in refugee camps, while dealing with situations bordering on their physical and psychological health.",

A refugee camp in Bangladesh is so cramped that its population density is nearly four times higher than that of New York City, making social distancing impossible (Beech; Hubard, 2020). This situation, as that of several other camps, is worrying, as the most effective methods for controlling are identifying the communicants and quarantining them; protecting health professionals with personal protective equipment; and identifying symptomatic patients, performing tests, giving results quickly and isolating them (Silva, 2020).",

The UNHCR has been accepting funds to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world. It seeks $255 million to provide support to displaced people and migrants in the fight against the disease that affects almost the whole world. Their intention is to provide laboratory equipment for tests and medical supplies for the treatment of patients affected by COVID-19; to disseminate information campaigns; to send supplies to needy regions and to move medical work teams across territories (UNHCR, 2020b).",

These situations are quite unsettling and can be exemplified by camps across For these various reasons, this population has a high risk of developing psychiatric disorders, which is worsened in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overcrowding, disruption of sewage disposal, poor standards of hygiene, poor nutrition, negligible sanitation (Shokri; Sabzevari; Hashemi, 2020), lack of access to shelter, health care, public services and safety are risk factor for COVID-19 and mental illness that when associated with fear and uncertainty creat a favorable situation for the psychological and biological illness of these communities (Bulik; Colucci, 2019). A Greek study compared the number of psychiatric diagnoses of refugees in Greece with natives, showing a rate almost four times higher (Tryantafyllou et al., 2018) . Systematic reviews show that prevalence estimates of mental health disorders for this population vary widely from 20 to 80%: 4 to 40% for anxiety, 5 to 44% for depression, 9 to 36% for posttraumatic stress disorder (Slewa-Younan et al., 2015) .",
