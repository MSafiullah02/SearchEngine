            "text": "Mysterious pneumonia has been reported during December 2019. The causative agent for this pneumonia was identified to be a novel coronavirus (nCoV) named earlier as 2019-nCoV and now termed coronavirs 2). The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This virus belongs to the subfamily Coronavirinae; this group of viruses is known to cause respiratory and gastrointestinal infections [1]. The first coronavirus was reported in the 1960s because it caused mild respiratory symptoms; these viruses were given the names (i) human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E) and (ii) HCoV-OC43 [2]. In 2003, sever acute respiratory syndrome-Cov (SARS-CoV) was identified as the agent that caused a global pandemic [3]. As of 03:00 GMT+3, 9 April 2020, more than 200 countries have been affected around the world, with a total of 1,436,198 diagnosed cases and 85,522 deaths [4]. Compared to the coronavirus reported to cause an outbreak in the Middle East, so-called MERS-CoV, the mortality rate for SARS-CoV-2 is relatively low; however, the number of affected cases is extremely high [2, 4, 5]. The latest SARS-CoV-2 was isolated by Chinese scientists, and the genetic sequence of the virus is now available [6]. The new outbreak is believed to be related to meat that derived from wild or captive sources at a seafood market [7]. All of the human CoV are known to have an animal source: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E are considered to have originated from bats; HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 probably originated from rodents [8] The recurrent corona outbreaks pose a global health threat as a new outbreak could not be avoided due to the interaction between human and animals, as well as human to human contact [1]. This urges the need to develop new curative treatment strategies and possible vaccines.",

The present rapid molecular docking study was carried out considering the extreme health and economic problems arising due to COVID-19 and the consequent high mortality all over the world, to screen anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs among approved drugs for treating HIV infection. Characterisation and biochemical properties of helicase in severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV showed that it unwound DNA and RNA [9, 11]. Helicase enzyme in coronavirus is a prominent viral replication enzyme. Helicases are evolutionarily conserved proteins in coronaviruses and Nidovirales [27]. Furthermore, double-stranded nucleic acids are separated into two single-stranded nucleic acids by helicases, which catalyse the separation [10]. Earlier studies have described the importance of coronavirus helicase on the therapeutic target [10]. Helicase can hydrolyse all ribonucleotide triphosphates and deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates in the SARS coronavirus [9, 11]. Helicase enzyme in coronavirus increases the unwinding of nucleic acid by twofold [10]. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 helicase was selected to identify helicase inhibitors through state-of-the-art tool-based screening to reveal the anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug targets. We used 23 clinically approved drugs previously listed for the treatment of HIV infection [19, 21]. The phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 helicase amino acid (420 amino acid) sequence against various sequence data retrieved through RefSeq protein BLAST and PSI-BLAST revealed > 90% similarity with SARS CoV in molecular phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood method with 500 replications in bootstrap [13]. Furthermore, the selected (PDB Id: 6jyt.2.A) template from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [15] showed 99.78% sequence identity with the SARS-CoV-2 helicase.",

The SARS-CoV-2 helicase and approved drug interaction using the modelled and validated druggable helicase protein predicted vapreotide and atazanavir as targets among the 23 approved drugs, as medications for HIV infection. Atazanavir is a protease inhibitor that is used to treat HIV. It inhibits HIV-1 protease, which is needed to cleave the viral polyprotein precursors. The absence of cleavage results in immature viral particles [29, 30]. Vapreotide was used for treating patients with AIDS-related diarrhoea [31], which showed the lowest binding free energy interaction with SARS-CoV-2 helicase compared to other drug molecules. The metabolism of atazanavir might decrease when used together with vapreotide; hence, detailed studies are needed for use of the combination [32]. The lack of wet laboratory experimental works on the effect of drugs on viruses is considered to be a major limitation of the study. It indicates that vapreotide is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 helicase and may be an option for treating COVID-19 after detailed wet lab studies.",
