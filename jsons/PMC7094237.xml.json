For example, engineered nanoparticles, if not protected by steric stabilizing agents, tend to aggregate into clusters up to several microns in aquatic environments ([14], [70], [31], [41]. Colloidal aggregation occurs when colloid collision, motivated by Brownian motion and/or external forces (e.g., gravitational force, hydrodynamic shear), results in particle\u2013particle attachment. The aggregation that occurs in a suspension composed of similar monodisperse colloidal particles is called homoaggregation [33]. Alternatively, aggregation of dissimilar particles is referred to heteroaggregation [42].",

In contrast, the transport of single particles in porous media has received considerable attention. Particularly, a systematical theory [i.e., colloid filtration theory (CFT)] has been developed to describe single particles\u2019 attachment, which is one of the primary factors (e.g., detachment and straining) controlling particle transport in porous media [75], [49], [20], [21], [54], [10], [66], [58]. The CFT illustrates that particle attachment involves two subsequent steps: (i) transport of particles from bulk fluid to the vicinity of collector surfaces and (ii) chemical\u2013colloidal interactions between particles and surfaces. The transport step is controlled by three individual mechanisms: interception, gravitational sedimentation, and Brownian diffusion. The chemical\u2013colloidal interactions include van der Waals attractions, electrical double layer interactions, and short-range repulsions (e.g., hydration forces and steric repulsion). These interaction forces are described by extended Derjaguin\u2013Landau\u2013Verwey\u2013Overbeek (XDLVO) theory [68], [44].",

Lin and Wiesner [41], however, showed that the colloid interaction energy for the nanoparticle aggregates is on the same order of magnitude as those for the primary particles and is significantly weaker than that for an equivalent sphere defined by the gyration radius of the aggregate. Johnson et al. [37] experimentally showed that fractal aggregates composed of microspheres can settle on average 4\u20138.3 times faster than predictions by calculations for impermeable or permeable spheres of identical mass, cross-sectional area, or primary particle density. They attributed the differences in settling velocities to the reason that fractal aggregates have large pores, causing smaller overall drags per total cross-sectional area.",

Knowledge of the mechanisms controlling colloidal aggregate\u2019s detachment is of importance in diverse engineered applications and environmental concerns [6] because detachment of aggregates can cause permeability loss in aquifers, turbidity increase in groundwater withdrawal wells, facilitated transport of contaminants in subsurface environments, etc. Considerable effort has been devoted to the investigation of detachment of single particles from collector surfaces. For example, both microscopic examinations [72] and column experiments [2], [56], [40] show that single particles attached in the DLVO secondary energy minima can be spontaneously released back to the bulk solution when the secondary energy minima are comparable to the average Brownian kinetic energy (1.5kT, where k is Boltzmann constant and T is absolute temperature). However, the release is commonly minor in a system and, for considerable particle detachment, a hydrodynamic or chemical disturbance to the system (e.g., changing flow velocity and solution chemistry, advancing/receding air\u2013water interfaces) is requisite [5], [6], [7], [1], [13].",

The surface element integration (SEI) technique was employed to calculate DLVO interaction energies/forces for the aggregates at different solution ionic strengths [8], [9], [41]. We showed that the aggregates of identical spheres are irreversible to reduction in solution ionic strength. The attached microspheres coated by nanoparticles can be detached from planar surfaces by decreasing ionic strengths. The coated nanoparticles also significantly decrease the adhesive forces between the microparticles and the planar surface, thus, the attached heteroaggregates are much more favored to be detached by applied forces compared to single microparticles. Additionally, we theoretically explain why viruses exhibit conservative transport behavior in the environments although small particles have low energy barriers and are readily to be attached in primary minima.",

These small colloidal clusters with well-defined structures have drawn considerable attention in recent years in colloidal self-assembly. Yi et al.

The cluster III was created as an aggregate of 20 spheres obtained by randomly placing them in the lattice sites of a simple cubic lattice by the Monte Carlo method [18]. Specifically, the first sphere was placed at the origin of the rectangular coordinate system. The position of the second sphere was randomly selected out of six possibilities. To place the third and any further spheres, a sphere that was already placed in the lattice was randomly chosen. Then the position of the new sphere was selected out of six possibilities in respect of the sphere chosen. Through occupancy test, the new sphere was placed if the position selected was free. Otherwise, the search for a suitable site was repeated. The cluster IV was created by placing 18 small spheres of equal sizes on a large sphere surface. The coordinates of the sphere centers for cluster III and the coordinates of the contacts between each small sphere and the large sphere for cluster IV are given in Table 1\n.",

Lin and Wiesner [41] showed that, based on the principle of the SEI, it is mathematically equivalent to calculate the interaction energy between an aggregate and a flat surface by simply summing the interaction energy between each primary particle and the flat surface. Details about using SEI to calculate the interaction energy between a primary sphere and a flat surface can be found in previous studies [8], [59]. Briefly, the Cartesian coordinate system was employed (see Fig. 1). The coordinate system originates from the center of the primary particle, with the z axis pointing toward the planar surface. The xy plane of the coordinate system is oriented parallel to the planar surface.",

The tetrahedral aggregate is oriented with one primary sphere facing toward the planar surface and the other three primary spheres facing away from the planar surface (denoted as MIN), or oriented with three primary spheres facing toward the planar surface and the other primary sphere facing away from the planar surface (denoted as MAX). Three sizes were considered for the primary spheres of the tetrahedral cluster: 10 nm, 50 nm, and 1000 nm (in diameter). The DLVO interaction energies between the planar surface and the spheres with sizes equal to the aggregates were also shown for comparison. The interaction energy barriers are decreased for the aggregates with orientation of MIN whereas increased for the orientation of MAX compared to those of the equivalent spheres at a given ionic strength. Therefore, the DLVO interaction energy barrier is influenced by the orientation of the aggregates. Similarly, Wu et al. [74] presented that the interaction energy between a single-walled carbon nanotube and an infinite isotropic planar surface is orientation-dependent. The primary minimum depth (or detachment energy barrier from primary minimum, obtained by subtracting primary minimum from maximum energy barrier) increases with decreasing ionic strength for the aggregates with both orientations, indicating that the aggregates attached in primary minima at high ionic strengths (e.g., 0.2 M) are irreversible to reduction in solution ionic strength.",

Comparison of Fig. 3 with Fig. 2 shows that the DLVO interaction energy barrier (or detachment energy barrier) reaches minimum for the orientation of MIN and maximum for the orientation of MAX. To interpret why the DLVO interaction energy barrier reaches minimum for the orientation of MIN whereas maximum for the orientation of MAX, the concept of \u201cinteraction volume\u201d developed by Huang et al. [32] can be utilized. The interaction volume is defined as the volume between the leading surface of the particle (e.g., the aggregate in this study) and the substrate (the planar surface in this study). Obviously, the interaction volume reaches maximum for the aggregate attached on the planar surface with orientation of MIN while reaches minimum for the aggregate with orientation of MAX. In fact, the interaction volume for the orientation of MIN is larger than that for any other orientation. According to Huang et al. [32], larger interaction volume between the aggregate and the planar surface results in smaller interaction energies/forces because the mean plane of the aggregate\u2019s leading surface recedes farther from the planar surface. Hence, DLVO interaction energy/force reaches minimum for the aggregate with orientation of MIN. If the aggregate attached with the orientation of MIN cannot be detached, the aggregate attached with all other orientations cannot be detached. In the following of the paper, we only considered the interaction between the planar surface and the aggregate with orientation of MIN (i.e., the worst case).",

The DLVO interaction energies between the planar surface and the single microparticle were also shown for comparison. When the diameters of the nanoparticles are 5 nm and 10 nm, the primary minimum disappears from the DLVO energy curves for the aggregates at 0.01 and 0.001 M and the DLVO interaction energy decreases monotonically with increasing separation distance. This indicates that the aggregates experience repulsive forces at all separation distances, and the aggregates that are initially attached in primary minima will be detached when the solution ionic strength is decreased to \u2a7d0.01 M. Therefore, heteroaggregation of nanoparticles with microparticles can change the chemical reversibility of the microparticles.

Specifically, when the interactive surfaces are like-charged, the DLVO interaction energy curve is characterized by a deep attractive well (the primary minimum) at a small separation distance, a maximum energy barrier, and a shallow attractive well (the secondary minimum) at a larger distance (type I). Colloid attachment in the presence of repulsive interactions is termed as \u201cunfavorable\u201d attachment. Both energy barrier and secondary minimum disappear and only the primary minimum exists in the DLVO interaction energy curves under favorable conditions (type II).

The diameters of the large sphere and the small spheres are 1000 nm and 10 nm, respectively. The DLVO interaction energy profiles for the heteroaggregate are very similar to those of DOUBLET, indicating that the interaction energies between the other small spheres of aggregate IV and the planar surface are negligible. This is because the DLVO interaction energies for the nanoparticle are minor compared to those for the microparticle and the interaction energy decreases rapidly with separation distance. The DLVO interaction energy profiles for the heteroaggregate and the DOUBLET are similar to the interaction energy curves for the large sphere starting from separation distance of 10 nm (i.e., \u03c3\n = 10 nm) (see Fig. 8c). This indicates that the small sphere at the bottom mainly plays a role of shifting the position of the Born repulsion and, accordingly, eliminates primary minima at low ionic strengths (0.01 M and 0.001 M) or decreases primary minimum depths at high ionic strengths (0.2 M and 0.1 M). Alternatively, the absence of primary minima can be explained by the reason that the shallow primary minimum between the small sphere at the bottom and the planar surface is eliminated by the strong repulsion between the remaining part of the aggregate (mainly the microparticle) and the planar surface. The microparticle, while separated by the nanoparticle, has strong repulsion on the planar surface because the repulsive double layer interaction energy decays much slower than the van der Waals interaction energy at low ionic strengths. When the small sphere of the heteroaggregate is increased to 100 nm in diameter, the microsphere is separated far from the planar surface and the interaction energies between the microsphere and the planar surface are minor. Meanwhile, the interaction energies between the 100 nm sphere at the bottom and the planar surface become significant. Thus, the primary minima appear again in the interaction energy curves (Fig. 8c). Because the DLVO interaction energies are minor for the small particles, the aforementioned results do not change for the heteroaggregate even if the small particles are irregularly attached on the large particle\u2019s surface.",

[11].(6)FD=10.2\u03c0\u03bcapVpwhere \u03bc is fluid viscosity, V\np is the relative velocity between the fluid and the particle at the center of the particle. The adhesive torque (T\nA) is represented by the adhesive force (F\nA) acting on a level arm l\nc:(7)TA=FAlcThe level arm l\nc is provided by the radius of particle\u2013surface contact area (a\n0), resulting from deformation of the particle.

A value of 4.0 \u00d7 109\n N m\u22122 was taken for the elastic interaction constant for the glass collectors and polystyrene particle suspensions [6], [40], [64]. Fig. 9 shows that the adhesive torque that the large sphere of the heteroaggregate experiences on the planar surface is even greater than the maximum hydrodynamic torque. This is why the colloid filtration theory considers particle attachment at primary minima as a very fast immobilization process (i.e., the perfect sink model) by assuming that the strong attraction that the particle experiences at primary minima dominates over other applied forces (e.g., the hydrodynamic drag) [54]. However, if the microparticle is covered by nanoparticles, the adhesive torque is greatly reduced and the attached aggregate at primary minima can be readily detached by the hydrodynamic drags commonly encountered in natural and engineered aquatic systems.",

In contrast, the DLVO theory shows that secondary minimum depth decreases with decreasing solution ionic strength. Therefore, the experimentally observed release of particles is commonly attributed to the detachment of those initially attached at secondary minima [50], [67], [57]. However, a number of studies [3], [53], [51], [79], [65], [58], [59], allowing particles to unambiguously attach in primary minima, found that the attached particles can be detached from primary minima upon reduction in solution ionic strength. Therefore, discrepancies exist between the observations and the prediction by the classic DLVO theory. The results in this study provide plausible explanation for the discrepancies.",

Particularly, detachment from primary minima will occur if the adhesion between the substrate and the primary sphere of the aggregate nearest the substrate or the rough asperity (not only spherical) is eliminated by the repulsion from the main body of the aggregate or the rough particle (not only micro-sized), For example, our study explains why viruses exhibit most conservative transport compared to microbial pathogens in the environments although the classic DLVO model predicts that smaller particles have lower interaction energy barriers and hence are more favored to be irreversibly attached at primary minima. This is because virus surfaces (i.e., capsid) are commonly rough (e.g., spikes on Coronavirus). The surface protrusions not only favor virus attachment, but also facilitate hydrodynamic and chemical detachment of viruses. Therefore, viruses can be continuously captured and released in the environment, causing traveling distances much farther than the predictions by irreversible models.",

This is because although the value of double layer interaction energy changes with using different expressions, the trend for the variation in interaction energy with ionic strength does not change for the homoaggregates or heteroaggregates. This study only adopted specific values for the Born collision diameter and Hamaker constant to calculate Born potential energy. Particle detachment from primary minimum will be enhanced with increasing Born collision parameter value and Hamaker constant value. In addition, our study considered that the interactions between aggregates and planar surface are nonspecific. Detachment could be reduced or even prevented if specific interactions (e.g., hydrophobic interaction) are present. We assumed that the particles are irreversibly aggregated. The aggregates may be redispersed during their detachment from surfaces if the particles are reversibly associated.

The fate and transport of the formed aggregates have received limited attention to date. In particular, the detachment of the aggregates from collector surfaces during transients in solution chemistry has not been investigated. This study thus theoretically examined detachment of homoaggregates and heteroaggregates from planar surface using surface element integration. We showed that attached homoaggregates in primary minima are irreversible to reduction in solution ionic strength whether the primary particles of the homoaggregates are nano-sized or micro-sized. The attachment of nanoparticles on microparticles, however, can cause the interaction energy between the planar surface and the formed heteroaggregates to decrease monotonically with separation distance at low ionic strengths (e.g., \u2a7d0.01 M), indicating that the heteroaggregates experience repulsive forces at all separation distances. Therefore, the attached heteroaggregates in primary minima at high ionic strengths (e.g., >0.1 M) can be detached upon reduction in ionic strength. Additionally, we showed that the adhesive forces and torques that the microparticles coated with nanoparticles experience are significantly smaller than those that the single microparticles experience and, thus, are readily detached from primary minima by hydrodynamic torque. Results of this study provide plausible explanation for the observed detachment/disaggregation of particles from primary minima upon reduction in solution ionic strength in the literature. Findings from this study also explain why viruses exhibit most conservative transport compared to microbial pathogens in the environments although the classic DLVO model predicts that smaller particles have lower interaction energy barriers and are favored to be irreversibly attached at primary minima.",
