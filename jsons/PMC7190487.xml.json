Metformin activates AMPK via liver kinase B1 (LKB1), inhibiting the mTOR pathway. It also indirectly attenuates AKT activation through phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) resulting in inhibition of the mTOR signalling cascade [11]. Other biguanide molecules, buformin and phenformin have been associated with better survival outcomes in animal models of influenza [12], [13]. Further, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays major roles in MERS\u2011CoV infection [14]. Since metformin inhibits the same pathway, it would be interesting to decipher its role against SARS-CoV-2.",

Further, 66 druggable human proteins/factors targeted by 69 medicines which were either FDA-approved or in clinical trials or pre-clinical molecules were recognized. To our interest, it was found that human proteins regulated by the mTORC1 signalling pathway, specifically LARP1 and FKBP7, interact with important viral proteins, N and Orf8 [15]. Since metformin inhibits mTOR signalling, it could act as an indirect modulator of the protein-protein complex, thus preventing the viral replication and pathogenesis.",

A study using HUVECs and human retinal vascular endothelial cells (HRvECs) showed that AMPK restricts the replication of ZIKV in the endothelial cells [16]. Activation of AMPK with the help of two well-known AMPK activators, metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) led to attenuation of ZIKV replication. Activated AMPK further potentiated the expression of certain genes with known antiviral properties such as IFNs, OAS2, ISG15, and MX1 while inhibiting inflammatory mediators like TNF-\u03b1 and CCL5. It would be useful to explore whether the same is observed for SARS-CoV-2. A recent study has reported that inhibition of glycolysis by non-toxic concentration of 2-DG completely attenuated SARS-CoV-2 replication in Caco-2 cells [17]. All of these indicate towards a possible frontline role of metformin against COVID-19.",

Further, a study had shown a direct metabolic link between SARS-CoV and diabetes, postulating that the virus enters the pancreatic islets which express ACE2, leading to acute \u03b2-cell damage and transient Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [19]. Evidence from an animal study points toward increased ACE2 activity in pancreas of persons with diabetes besides its elevated expression in other tissues such as lung, liver and heart [20]. Hence, optimal control of T2DM, for both chronic and transient cases, might help in the treatment of COVID-19. Although recent discussions point out that oral hypoglycaemic agents such as Sodium-Glucose-Transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1RAs), Pioglitazone and even Insulin might actually be harmful for COVID-19 individuals with diabetes [21], [22], limited evidence is available on metformin for the same. Considering its pleiotropic effects and a possible role in combating hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through increasing insulin sensitivity [23], metformin can be a real game-changer for treating this pandemic.",
