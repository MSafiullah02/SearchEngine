The outbreak resulted in about 8000 cases with a fatality of about 10% until it was quarantined (Drosten et al., 2003, Fouchier et al., 2003). SARS-CoV still maintains a significant threat to human health, as novel viruses such as these still present a possibility for re-emergence into the human population so an understanding of the mechanics of entry is crucial in order to develop effective treatment.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with positive sense RNA genomes that commonly cause respiratory and enteric diseases within a wide host range (Holmes, 2003). Entry of these viruses is mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein S and a receptor on the target cell. The viral spike glycoprotein can be cleaved into S1 and S2 domains (Bergeron et al., 2005, Du et al., 2007, Follis et al., 2006, Huang et al., 2006, Jackwood et al., 2001, Kawase et al., 2009, Watanabe et al., 2008, Yamada et al., 1998). The S1 domain of the viral spike protein dictates tropism and is responsible for mediating receptor binding (Chen et al., 1997, Han et al., 2007, Hensley and Baric, 1998, Hofmann et al., 2006, Lewicki and Gallagher, 2002, Li et al., 2003, Li et al., 2007, Schultze et al., 1996, Thorp and Gallagher, 2004, Wentworth and Holmes, 2001). The S2 domain is responsible for mediating membrane fusion between the virus and host cell, with strong sequence conservation within the family (Bosch et al., 2004, Chu et al., 2006)\u2014hence the mechanics of fusion can be expected to be conserved across the Coronaviridae.",

            "text": "Based on structural similarities, the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is a class 1 membrane fusion protein (Schibli and Weissenhorn, 2004). The S2 domain contains two heptad repeat regions, HR1 and HR2, as well as a fusion peptide. Following conformational changes based on receptor binding or change in pH, the S2 domain drives fusion of the viral and host cell membranes to allow virus entry. Observations of cell surface expressed SARS-CoV spike protein, indicated that most of the protein was not cleaved at the S1\u2013S2 boundary and with at best limited cleavage possible (Song et al., 2004, Xiao et al., 2003). It is generally considered that S1\u2013S2 cleavage is not directly linked to fusion peptide exposure in the case of SARS-CoV, or any other coronavirus (Bosch and Rottier, 2008). However, it has recently been shown that SARS-CoV S can be proteolytically cleaved at a downstream position in S2, at residue 797 (Belouzard et al., 2009), and a highly conserved region C-terminal to the cleavage site has been characterized and identified as critical for fusion (Madu et al., 2009).",

These flanks represent two of the 39 cysteines in S that are likely to form intra-disulfide bonds within S. Cysteine residues and their roles in mediating entry either in the receptor binding region or in the cytoplasmic tail have been well documented for coronaviruses (Petit et al., 2007, Petit et al., 2005, Thorp et al., 2006, Ye et al., 2004). For other families of viruses, cysteine residues have been key players for driving entry (Matthias and Hogg, 2003, Matthias et al., 2002) and fusion (Delos et al., 2008, Delos and White, 2000, Parrott et al., 2009, Rai et al., 2004). In this study, we investigated the importance of a conserved domain in SARS-CoV S2 flanked by cysteines 822 and 833 by carrying out a comprehensive mutagenesis study. Using cell\u2013cell fusion and pseudovirus assays, we show that this domain is critical for the activation of SARS-CoV S-mediated membrane fusion and virus entry.",

The rationale for these mutations was as follows: residues G824, D825, N827, and A828 were simply mutated to alanine (or serine in the case of A828) to modify their chemical nature in an innocuous manner; the conserved residues C822 and C833 were mutated to serine to change the chemical nature of the cysteines and prevent normal disulphide bond formation; the C822S/C833S double mutant was designed to curb the possibility of spurious disulfide bonding occurring with un-paired cysteines; D830L and L831D mutants were generated to modify the chemistry of each original residue with the corresponding conserved residue, as both are 100% conserved; and to further address how residues within the proposed loop might be important, we generated a loop deletion mutant \u0394823\u2013832 and a flexible tripeptide GAG loop (Kwong et al., 1998) between the flanking cysteines.",

Given its proximity to a cleavage site and the proposed fusion peptide, we set out to characterize this domain. Sequence alignment of this domain showed a strong conservation particularly in the C-terminus of the region. We set out to carry out a series of mutagenic studies in a comprehensive manner. Our investigation entailed the replacing of core-conserved residues with residues to modify the chemistry of the wild type residues, and substituting or deleting the residues between the cysteines. This comprehensive investigation of the residues between C822 and C833 allowed us to gauge the extent of involvement of this region in the membrane fusion process.

One possible way the domain flanked by cysteine residues C822 and C833 may do so is by forming a disulfide bond-anchored loop that interacts with an as yet undisclosed part of the fusion protein to promote membrane fusion. In the absence of a crystal structure of the SARS-CoV S ectodomain, a predictive model of the quaternary structure is available: PDB code 1T7G (Bernini et al., 2004, Spiga et al., 2003) (Fig. 7A). In the context of this model, the cysteine-flanked region is represented as a loop region with the cysteines 822 and 833 positioned directly next to each other, which we predict to form a disulphide bond (Fig. 7B). The environment is one that might hint at further interactions with other parts of the spike protein. Of particular interest is the finding that residues C822, L823, G824, D825, I826, N827 and A828 within the loop are part of a major antigenic determinant of SARS-CoV S (residues L803\u2013A828) capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies (Zhang et al., 2004). In conclusion, we present data of a critical domain of SARS-CoV S2 that is required for the successful function of S-mediated fusion. We propose this region functions by interactions with other domain(s) in S to activate membrane fusion. It is important to point out that in the absence of a \u201ctrue\u201d crystal structure, we cannot rule out the fact that this region may function through many other possible roles within SARS-CoV S to aid in membrane fusion.",
