Starting from the available structural data on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor, we here engineered a mini-protein with the aim of creating a soluble and stable Spike interactor. This mini-protein, which was recombinantly produced in high yields, possesses a stable \u03b1 helical conformation and is able to interact with the RBD of glycosylated Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 with nanomolar affinity, as measured by microscale thermophoresis. By plugging the Spike protein, our mini-protein constitutes a valid tool for the development of treatments against different types of coronavirus.",

The S protein forms homotrimers protruding from the viral envelope and binds with high affinity to the host receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), mainly expressed by epithelial cells of the respiratory tract [6] . Recently, another human receptor, CD147, has been identified as a possible route of viral entrance, again mediated by the S protein [7] . CD147 is also known as Basigin or EMMPRIN, and is a transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily involved in many processes, including tumor development, plasmodium invasion and virus infection [7] . After attachment, the human transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) cleaves and activates the S protein, thus allowing SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells [8] . Compared to SARS-CoV, an additional protease, possibly furin, is likely involved in priming of the SARS-Cov-2, since the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains four redundant furin cut Pro-Arg-Arg-Ala motifs, which are absent in SARS-CoV [6] . The S protein contains two subunits, S1 and S2.",

Based on the structural information available on the complex between the S protein and the ACE2 receptor [10] , we engineered a miniaturised mimic of ACE2, here named Spikeplug. This mini-protein, which we produced in high yields, is highly soluble, conformationally stable and displays nanomolar binding affinity with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2.

An important issue with peptide or small protein design is their conformational stability, since peptides are usually not folded in solution. Therefore, to stabilise this scaffold, we included an extra helix, H3 (residues 91-101) which naturally caps helices H1 and H2 in the ACE2 structure, through a cluster of hydrophobic interactions involving Val92, Leu97 and Leu100 of H3, Phe28, Leu29, Phe32 of H1 and Ala80 of H2, therefore holding together the two helices H1 and H2 ( Figure 1 ). In addition, we noticed that Glu37 is important to stabilise the structure of the ACE2 receptor by forming a salt bridge interaction with Arg393 and a hydrogen bond with the backbone N of Lys353 ( Figure 2A ). However, this residue forms a weak hydrogen bond with Tyr505, which is considered outside the Receptor Binding Motif SARS-CoV-2 [10] , while it is not engaged in any contact in the complex of ACE2 with RBD of the S protein of SARS-CoV (74% homologous to SARS-CoV-2 and 83% on the RBD domain) [11] . Therefore, we mutated Glu37 to an arginine residue and energy minimised using GROMACS [12] .",

We focused on generating a Spike interactor that resembles the human ACE2 receptor as we argued that such type of molecule would act against all known coronaviruses using this receptor, such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63, as well as other coronavirues possibily emerging in the future. Several structures of the complex between the S protein and the ACE2 receptor have been recently published. Based on this structural information, we designed a mini-protein which embeds all important Spike-interacting residues of the ACE2 receptor. This miniaturised mimic of ACE2, was properly engineered to be stable in solution and to enhance its affinity with the S protein. Indeed, an important issue with peptide-or protein-based drugs is its conformational stability. This mini-protein, Spikeplug, presents a highly stable \u03b1 helical conformation in solution and a nanomolar binding affinity to the RBD domain of glycosylated S protein from SARS-CoV-2. The dissociation constant KD determined here using MST, 40 nM, is in the same range of the affinity measured between the S protein and the ACE2 receptor of 14.7 nM [5] . We are currently designing additional variants to further improve binding affinity to the S protein.",

First, if a novel coronavirus will emerge, able to infect humans through the ACE2 receptor, then its S proteins will be recognised and plugged by our receptor mimics ( Figure 5) , blocking viral entry. Importantly, Spikeplug is large enough to cover most important interactions with the S protein, but small enough to bind simultaneously to the three chains of the S protein, thus increasing its potential to hamper interactions with the ACE2 receptor ( Figure 5 ). Another point we considered in our research was drug resistance, as pathogens can easily mutate to escape therapeutic treatments.",

The validity of such an approach has been demonstrated by the development of the antiretroviral drug Enfuvirtide, which blocks the action of the HIV-1 gp41 fusion protein, thus preventing viral entry. As for all antiviral drugs, also Enfuvirtide can select for resistance mutations. However, it has been shown that resistance to the drug comes at a serious fitness cost for the virus since it involves structural alterations in an essential component of the virus-host cell fusion complex [13] . Hence, targeting the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 might also result in a high genetic barrier towards resistance. Last, we expect Spikeplug to be well tolerated because of its almost complete identity with the correspondent domains of the endogenous human protein.",
