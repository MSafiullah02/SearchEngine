Severe respiratory disease is the most concerning clinical presentation in adult patients. Initial reports during the pandemic suggested children have milder illness during acute infection [1]. Recent reports suggest a new COVID-19 related clinical syndrome, with significant inflammation and similarities to Kawasaki disease (KD), can present in children. Some children have had features of toxic shock syndrome and myocarditis with cardiogenic shock. Clinical reports have recently been published from the United States [2], Italy [3], the United Kingdom [4], France and Switzerland [5], and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has issued an emergency alert [6].",

MIS-C can present at any time, although based on recent (primarily anecdotal) reports, often occurs 1\u20136 weeks following infection, and may overlap with an acute respiratory COVID-19 presentation [2,3]. It can appear similar to KD with coronary artery aneurysms and extracardiac manifestations. Many described cases of KD-like MIS-C fall outside the typical age group (older) and ethnic background (predominantly non-Asian) than classic KD. It remains unclear if this syndrome is unique to children or if it occurs in adults with COVID-19. Besides potentially presenting with some or most of the symptoms associated with KD (hand and foot inflammation/swelling, mucous membrane changes/strawberry tongue, non-exudative conjunctivitis, rash, and unilateral significant lymphadenopathy) [7], MIS-C can present with evidence of multiorgan failure including neurologic involvement, hyperferritinemia, and cardiogenic or vasoplegic shock. Most reports describe significant GI manifestations on presentation, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and severe abdominal pain. The multi-faceted nature of the disease course and various presentations underlines the need for multispecialty input (emergency medicine, critical care, cardiology, infectious diseases, hematology, nephrology, and rheumatology). Our knowledge of this newly described entity is evolving by the day, as are the proposed diagnostics, pharmacological and non-pharmacological management, and recommendations.",

Many centers have treated children that present most similar to KD with traditional therapy used for KD. We recommend giving IVIG 2 g/kg and aspirin 20\u201325 mg/kg/dose every 6 h (80\u2013100 mg/kg/day) for all patients with KD-like illness, evidence of excessive inflammation (ferritin >700 ng/ml, CRP >30 g/dL, or multisystem organ failure), or cardiac involvement. Aspirin dosage may also vary at individual centers. Patients with KD-like illness in high-risk categories (infants, KD shock syndrome, CRP >130 g/dL, admission echo Z score >2.5 or aneurysms, Asian race) should receive IVIG 2 g/kg as single infusion with a three-day pulse methylprednisolone. If the presentation is most consistent with KD and there is failure of first line treatment a second dose of IVIG or infliximab (a Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor) could be considered.

With KD, another echocardiogram at six weeks is typical, but if the patient has myocarditis or a large aneurysm, this may need more frequent monitoring.

Cardiac findings in KD typically manifest with coronary artery changes and rarely with depression of ventricular function. Initial published and non-published reports of COVID-19 associated MIS-C cases describe ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery changes, atrioventricular valve regurgitation and pericardial effusions [[2], [3], [4], [5]]. Therefore, it is prudent for cardiac screening to be completed early in hospital course; including measures of cardiac injury and ventricular dysfunction. In children presenting with shock (most have reported vasodilatory shock) fluid resuscitation is imperative in the initial management. As there is a high potential for underlying cardiac dysfunction, patients should be frequently reassessed during fluid resuscitation for evidence of fluid overload such as pulmonary edema or hepatomegaly. In centers with bedside ultrasound available, evaluation of cardiac function may be considered early in resuscitation to determine best management. Complete transthoracic echocardiogram should be performed urgently in all patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of cardiac injury and/or shock (see Fig. 1). In children with reassuring initial cardiac evaluation or mild to moderate disease, it is reasonable to consider ongoing cardiac screening throughout hospitalization due to reports of rapid decompensation. It is also reasonable to follow serum troponin and/or BNP and consider repeating echocardiogram with any significant laboratory or clinical changes.",

Early recognition of shock state (vasoplegic vs cardiogenic), proper and judicious fluid resuscitation, early establishment of invasive monitoring, intubation and mechanical ventilation, optimization of oxygen delivery (DO2), minimization of oxygen consumption (VO2), and appropriate initiation of inotropes and vasopressors are key factors to successful and favorable outcome [5,10,11]. This initial approach combined with multidisciplinary management and initiation of early but comprehensive diagnostics help to guide further therapeutic choices (e.g. antithrombotics, antibiotics, and immunomodulators). Extracorporeal therapies like plasmapheresis (therapeutic plasma exchange) [12] and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [5] may have a role in treating and supporting these patients especially in cases of severe cytokine storm, refractory vasoplegia and cardiogenic or septic shock. The recent report from Switzerland and France supports such an approach [5]. They described the experience of thirty-five critically ill children with MIS-C presenting with acute myocardial injury/myocarditis and cardiogenic shock. Initial symptoms on presentation were mainly fever, fatigue and GI manifestations. Inotropic support was required in 80%, while veno-arterial (VA) ECMO was initiated in 28% in this cohort. Despite the rapid deterioration at presentation, a rapid resolution of the systolic myocardial function was noted. All patients survived and none had embolic or thrombotic events. All patients received IVIG and 65% received heparin for anticoagulation.",

It has been associated with high rates of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) including deep vein thromboses, pulmonary emboli, digital ischemia, arterial thrombosis, microvascular thrombosis and strokes [13]. Prophylactic anticoagulation for adults hospitalized with COVID has been widely accepted, with many centers escalating to intermediate-dose or therapeutic anticoagulation for adults with signs of coagulopathy and/or organ failure, given the high rates of breakthrough VTE for adults on prophylactic anticoagulation [14]. Strategies regarding prophylactic anticoagulation in COVID-19 pediatric patients vary institutionally, but many have elected for a minimum prophylactic anticoagulation strategy in adolescents and the critically ill. Whether or not MIS-C patients have the same risk of VTE as during acute COVID-19 is unclear; however, these patients also have evidence of activation of coagulation (high D-dimer, high fibrinogen), inflammation, multi-organ dysfunction and require critical care intervention including the placement of central lines. Prophylactic anticoagulation with enoxaparin is reasonable to consider in critically ill patients, and hospitalized patients with significant derangements of coagulation. Patients with expanding or large coronary artery aneurysms will require therapeutic anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. In low-risk patients with KD or KD-like disease, aspirin monotherapy in accordance with established guidelines can be considered [7]. The effect of these interventions in ameliorating disease severity needs further study.",

The children that fulfilled classic criteria of KD within early reports of MIS-C generally had less myocardial involvement (near normal ventricular function, lower troponins, lower BNPs) and seemed to respond well to care directed at KD [3]. KD shock presentation has been reported in up to 7% of cases of KD previously and is known to have elevations in BNP and troponins [9] with a clinical picture consistent with myocarditis. In the MIS-C cases reported, there have been a number with both inflamed coronaries and shock that would fit into the diagnosis of KD Shock Syndrome, however, not all of these reported patients have been shown to have preceding SARS-CoV-2.

This syndrome is characterized by an overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 resulting in clinical symptoms of high fevers, rashes, coagulopathy, and neurologic changes, with some progressing to multiple organ failure and death [15]. Lab abnormalities frequently associated with CSS include thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and elevations of the following: transaminase levels, D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), coagulation times, CRP, and ferritin (ferritin is often profoundly elevated). This syndrome is very similar to macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) which is commonly encountered and treated by rheumatologists. Treatments that have proven effective for treatment of MAS include corticosteroids, anakinra and tocilizumab among others [16]. Early reports, mainly from China, described adult patients that fit the description of COVID-19 associated CSS, and had successful outcomes after treatment with tocilizumab [17]. For this reason, many across the US have proposed this medication be used if evidence of CSS exists. Many rheumatologists, including our group, would propose using anakinra (IV is suggested specifically as subcutaneous dosing was not found to be as effective in one study) if children have evidence of CSS or are severely ill with multiorgan failure [18]. Anakinra has a quick onset, short half-life (4 h), large therapeutic window, and a good safety profile. We find this a favorable treatment option; if there is not a quick and adequate response an alternate medication can be considered.",
