            "text": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is one of the most severe diseases communicable in birds. HPAI infection results in acute diseases with high morbidities and mortalities. Recent outbreaks and researches have revealed that HPAI could break through the species barrier to infect humans with high mortalities. The first outbreak was documented in Hong Kong in 1997 with 18 human cases including six fatalities (Yuen et al. 1998; Chan 2002). Since its reemergence from 2003 in Southeast Asia, 172 people have died from HPAI infection (WHO 2006). HPAI is becoming a serious threat to public health because of its fast genetic variation and increasing adaptation to humans. The establishment of rapid and reliable methods for H5 avian influenza virus detection is of great value for the control and prevention of HPAI.",

All the procedures were carried out in high containment conditions, and cross\u2010contaminations among samples and false\u2010positive results were therefore greatly avoided. The newly developed technique of minor groove binder (MGB) probe for diagnosis of virus infection has additional advantages over the traditional TaqMan probes (Fernandez et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2005; Lole and Arankalle 2006). The MGB technique can enlarge the difference in T\nm values between the target template and other nonspecific nucleic acids, to obtain high specificity. The MGB probe can also improve hybridization stability and reduce the fluorescence background to obtain high sensitivity.

The DH5\u03b1 competent cells were transformed with ligation mixture and spreaded on an LB plate containing ampicillin. Escherichia coli colonies were picked up and positive clones were identified using PCR amplification. Sequencing analysis was conducted to further confirm the insertion of HA gene. The concentration of recombinant plasmid DNA was determined by absorbance of UV light at 260 and 280 nm. The plasmid was then linearized at the SalI site and 5 \u03bcg DNA was used as template in an in vitro transcription reaction with the Riboprobe System using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). After the in vitro transcription reaction at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, the DNA was digested by DNase I at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. The purified RNA was quantified with a spectrophotometer. The copy number of transcribed RNA was then determined following the method of Fronhoffs et al. (2002). The transcribed RNA was used for external standard in the amplification. Standard curve was created according to the reaction in which 10\u2010fold serial dilutions of transcribed RNA containing 108 to 101 molecules was employed as template.

            "text": "The early laboratory detection of nucleic acid from suspected cases provided evidence for quarantine and medication in the control and prevention of HPAI outbreaks. There have been several papers describing the real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR detection of influenza viruses. Some have described the simultaneous detection of influenza A, including H5N1, while others described the subtyping of H5 influenza virus (Ng et al. 2005; Whiley and Sloots 2005; Payungporn et al. 2006; Wen et al. 2006). In this report, a rapid diagnosis of H5 avian influenza was implemented using TaqMan\u2010MGB real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. The method combined a quick and sensitive detection of the nucleic acids of H5 avian influenza, and a threshold of 100 copies could be detected. Specificity was also improved by the fluorescent probe. Electrophoresis of amplified fragments was substituted by the direct fluorescence detection during the PCR process and the duration of detection was reduced. The newly developed TaqMan\u2010MGB probe is more stable and can improve signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratios due to the use of a non\u2010fluorescent quencher instead of the fluorescent quencher dye (Afonina et al. 2002). The combination of MGB stabilizes the hybridization of the probe and the T\nm value is about 10\u00b0C higher than conventional TaqMan probes. As a result, short oligonucleotides of about 15 nucleotides can be used for hybridization and therefore confer more options in the optimization of probe sequence. The MGB technique also has an advantage in the discrimination of mismatched nucleotide during hybridization (Lew et al. 2004). The specificity of detection using the MGB\u2010labelled probe was similar to that obtained by non\u2010MGB fluorescent probes, but more sensitivity was obtained when the MGB technique was employed in the detection of H5 avian influenza. One hundred molecules of external standard were detectable using the 16\u2010bp MGB probe specific for the H5 gene. The sensitivity was higher than using a conventional TaqMan probe which was obtained as 103\u2013104 copies (Spackman et al. 2002).",
