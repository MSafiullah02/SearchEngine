Afterwards, the tests were applied according to the Mexican official norm NOM-158-SSA-1996 related to technical specifications for diagnostic medical equipment that uses X-rays. Preventive maintenance tests were developed. These included physical, mechanical, and electrical aspects for monitoring the most significant functionality parameters in the equipment, in order to assure their stability as a function of time. Quality tests were also developed. These evaluate functionality parameters with the objective to get a reference value (control value). These parameters were: focal point, exposure time, performance, field coincidence, center coincidence, fuzzy alignment, exposure rate for conventional fluoroscopy, and dose in breast tumor radiation. Both preventive maintenance and quality tests were applied to 12 items of radio-diagnostic equipment (which included X-ray, CAT,mastograph, and fluoroscopy equipment) at the hospital during three consecutive weeks.

Identification of the medical technology used in each surgery. Six technology sets were defined, according to the medicalcategoriesidentified. In the case of orthopedics, this requires two different technology sets, i.e. one for shoulder surgeryand other for knee surgery. 3. Weconsulted 16 technicalmanuals with the purpose of obtainingthe technical specifications of the equipment, as wellas the manufacturers'recommendations for the use and management of the equipment. 4. Fourteen technical schedules were developed with the next information: (a) description of the equipment(including alarms); (b) physical inspection procedure; (c) management of the equipment (washing, sterilization (if necessary), warehoused, andcare); and (d) warnings and precautions. This information was incorporated in the procedurein order to provide the technical elements about the functionality of the equipmentto the technicalpersonnel from the BED. 5 . Six generic procedures about the use and management of electronic devices and medical equipment used in each minimally invasive surgery identified were elaborated. It is important to say that biomedical engineering helps the physician in all the procedures related to the minimally invasive surgeries done at the hospital. In this sense, the procedures included in the manual will be an instrument for technical and medical personnel for learning the adequate used of the medical technology, and so the optimization of the resources and the technical capability of the hospital.",

The center works with the human immunodeficiency virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza virus (H5Nl) and the SARS corona virus. It has three laboratories designed with the necessary bio-safety standards, levels BSL2 and BSL3. The laboratory equipment has two kinds of contact with the infectious agents, namely direct and indirect. For example, pipettes have direct contact and C02 incubators have indirect contact because the virus is in Petri boxes. That is why the technology requires specific management and control. The objective of this study was to develop preventive maintenance procedures for the laboratory equipment present in this center, involving aspects about risk management and quality control. The importance of these kinds of procedure is that activities related to the maintenance and the sanitation procedures attending bio-safety should decrease the biological risk for technical personnel. In this sense, the partial goals of this study were to provide to the technical personnel from the BED the bio-safety procedures necessary for minimizing biological risk during the execution of work:",
