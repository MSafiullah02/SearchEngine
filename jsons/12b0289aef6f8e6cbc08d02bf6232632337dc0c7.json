In light of this situation, the Japanese Government declared a state of emergency in seven regions of Japan on April 7, 2020 under the provisions of the law. This declaration was extended to the entire nation on the April 17, 2020. The incidence of pneumonia from COVID-19 is considerably higher than from seasonal influenza, and the number of cases with no identifiable route of infection has increased rapidly [2, 3] . The medical care delivery system has been under pressure [4] . Emphasis should be placed on maintaining medical care systems. Although various surgical societies have published guidelines on which to base their surgical decisions [5, 6] , it is not clear how general anesthesia has been performed and will be performed in Japan.",
