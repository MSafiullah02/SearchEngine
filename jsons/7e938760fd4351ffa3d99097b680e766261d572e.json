Therefore, the major difference between PIA and CIA is the use of CII in the immunization emulsion in CIA. CIA and PIA are clinically very similar, aside from the fact that CIA affects the phalangeal joints more profoundly than does PIA and that relapses are more prominent during chronic disease in PIA. PIA is a T cell-dependent disease, although the specificity of the autoimmune reaction is unknown (10) . CIA is more complex, having the added influence of B cells due to the in vivo affinity of CII-specific antibodies for cartilage (34) . Since CIA shares T cell dependence with PIA but has the additional antibody-dependent mechanism, it is expected that CIA would share some genetic linkages with PIA as well as demonstrate some specific genetic regulation.

These findings suggest that these loci harbor genes that control the general inflammatory response elicited by the adjuvant. The antibody QTLs in CIA found on chromosomes 20 and 14 are equivalent to Ciaa1/Pia1 and Ciaa7/Pia6, respectively. Both Pia1 and Pia6 are loci that regulate chronic arthritis. Hence, the identification of these loci with the use of anti-CII antibodies or RFs in CIA possibly reflects an antibody-regulated phase, which is observed in the chronic phase of PIA. In CIA, an immune response to joint-specific antigen (CII) is triggered soon after immunization, which possibly accounts for the involvement of these loci in acute disease.

Recently, the Cia12/Pia4 QTL was found to confer structural polymorphism in the Ncf1 gene (35) . The effect of this genetic variation resulted in differential production of free radicals by the NADPH oxidase complex (36) . We hypothesized that the production of oxygen radicals by the antigenpresenting cells reduces the priming of autoreactive T cells.

This result is highly significant, since it suggests that the Cia13/Pia7 locus on chromosome 4 represents genes that are involved in the processing/presentation of, and response to, joint antigens. Furthermore, we showed the usefulness of different disease-reflecting phenotypes, such as COMP and \u2423 1 -acid glycoprotein, in characterizing and evaluating the impact of QTLs, both in linkage studies and in studies of congenic strains. There have been several reports of other arthritis models with a matching position of the loci of importance in controlling different types of arthritis. For example, both oil-induced arthritis and squaleneinduced arthritis are regulated by a QTL on rat chromosome 10, which was successfully isolated in a congenic strain (37) . Interestingly, Oia2, the locus corresponding to Cia13/Pia7, was also recently isolated and characterized in a congenic strain in which the disease-protective chromosome 4 allele from PVG rats was transferred to the DA background. This congenic strain also showed significant protection against PIA, CIA, squalene-induced arthritis, and adjuvant-induced arthritis (38) . Thus, it is plausible that the Cia13, Oia2, and Pia7 loci share a gene in E3 and PVG rats that also confers disease protection in the DA strain. Moreover, Mycobacterium butyricum adjuvant-induced arthritis has been found to be regulated by previously identified and isolated CIA loci, such as Cia5 (Aia5) (39) . These findings stress the importance of using several models to study the regulation of arthritis by the QTLs of interest, since information concerning the function of the underlying genes may be identified.
