In accordance with these results, Barsam et al12 investigated the main risk factors associated with CAP in children and found that children under 5 had a higher risk for the development of CAP. Similarly, Li et al 13 investigated the incidence of CAP in Chinese children under 5 years of age, reporting that those under 1 year were more susceptible to pneumonia. This is possibly the first study to report an association between children under 1 year of age and severe CAP. This study found an interesting gender association, with males exhibiting a higher incidence of severe CAP. However, Haugen et al14 studied 420 children with nonsevere and severe CAP but did not observe this gender association. This disagreement suggests that new studies with higher numbers of subjects are necessary to resolve the relevance of gender as a risk factor.",
