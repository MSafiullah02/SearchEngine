Longitudinal studies are needed to analyze the long-term impact of this situation on the psychological state of their members and to draw conclusions about the cause and effect relationships between the variables involved. Secondly, we adopted a convenient online survey in only one university from Spain, which may contribute to some bias in the study results. Larger scale surveys in different universities should be conducted in order to extend and generalize the findings. Thirdly, our results indicate the need of incorporating additional aspects in future studies. For example, it is important to explore why younger students are suffering a greater psychological impact, which could be related to factors such as their perception of the future, their way of consuming information media, etc.",
