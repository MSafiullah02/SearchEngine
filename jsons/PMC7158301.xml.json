This is in part because of the scarcity of written records from 2000 years ago and because of difficulties in identification of which species was actually being domesticated. Vernacular names for the animal we presume to be the ferret frequently varied from geographic district to district, and ancient scientists may have added to the confusion with incorrect translations from one language to another.43\n",

With time, domestication results in physical and physiologic changes from the ancestral species. Animals are domesticated for work, food, or materials for clothing and shelter. Ferrets were in all probability originally used by man to control vermin. The earliest written account of an animal that fits the description of our domesticated ferret dates back to the Greek satiric writer Aristophanes (448-385 BC), who used the term \u201chouse ferret\u201d in several of his plays to satirize political opponents. Soon thereafter, in 350 BC, the Greek philosopher and naturalist Aristotle (384-322 BC) also made written reference in a treatise on animals and physiognomy to a polecat that \u201cresembles a weasel; and becomes very mild and tame.\u201d43 It is reasonable to suppose he was referring to the ferret, and the demeanor of the animal described implies a close association with people. These early written accounts coincide with the time (circa 300 BC) when agriculture began to take hold in the civilized regions of the northern Mediterranean region centered around present-day Greece. One theory suggests the Greeks domesticated the indigenous European polecat (Mustela putorius) in order to protect grain stores from rodent infestation much in the way the Egyptians domesticated the cat.",

Ferrets that caught and ate the rabbits not only would destroy the food source and pelt but also would be more difficult to retrieve from the rabbit burrow. To discourage prey capture, working ferrets sometimes were harnessed with string, had bells attached to their collars, or were muzzled. With time the instinct to hunt and kill was bred out of the ferret. The sport of ferreting is still practiced by many people in Europe and Australia but is outlawed in the United States and Canada.",

Because M. putorius and M. eversmannii are occasionally reported to hybridize where they overlap in their distribution, the reality of a true species split has been debated, and several authors have at least considered whether M. putorius, M. eversmannii, and the endangered Mustela nigripes from North America (black-footed ferret) could be viewed as one Holarctic species.13\n",

The best explanation for the difference in socialization patterns is that familiarization and habituation*\nplay a significant role in the ferret's social response to both man and conspecifics. Familiarization in the form of imprinting may be involved as young polecats removed from their mothers during this critical phase in their development (4 to 10 weeks) become imprinted on their human caretakers. Evidence to support this belief is the fact that young polecats follow their mother on foraging expeditions and that hand-reared ferrets readily follow a human being. It has also been shown that the presence of the mother appears to facilitate the development of fear of humans in the young.34 In captivity, however, fear of humans does not develop in wild polecats if they are removed from their mother at any time before the second day after their eyes have opened (typically 28 to 34 days).34 Socialized ferrets are also more likely to show habituation than isolated ferrets,9 demonstrating that socialization and domestication go hand in hand. Pet ferrets acclimate to their environment and will rise to the occasion when given an opportunity to play, explore, or interact with others. In other words, they become diurnal as their periods of activity coincide with that of their human household.",

The attention response is essentially a method of scanning for stimuli. The European polecat shows extreme caution in exploring an unfamiliar environment; it takes frequent cover, uses definite pathways in the immediate vicinity of its den, and regularly returns to its home area after making forays into unfamiliar territory. The polecat also shows a more rapidly diminished attention response to auditory stimuli.",

These results again appear to support Lorenz's view that domesticated animals show more juvenile behavior as compared with their wild counterparts.19 Ehrlich's work with the black-footed ferret15 demonstrated similar findings: increased handling (equivalent to greater degree of domestication) leads to increased exploration behavior. Those findings may explain why today's domestic ferret shows an intense curiosity and little fear of its surroundings. When allowed to roam, the domestic ferret shows fearless exploratory behavior: Box on the floor? Got to see what's in it. Hole in the floorboard by dishwasher? Got to go inside and explore.

Successful bites (i.e., those during which the opponent was unable to break free) were sometimes accompanied by shaking or dragging of the immobilized animal. When the attacked animal was able to break free, it sometimes displayed evidence of intimidation, including screaming, defensive biting, hissing, fleeing, urinating, or defecating.

Recently purchased or adopted ferrets may be especially problematic, as they come with limited socialization, training, or handling. These (often young) ferrets may bite as a fear response to sudden movements and noise. This is probably a reflex response that stems from the ferret's wild counterparts who were preyed on by larger mammals or birds of prey. If frightened or startled the ferret may show a defense reaction much like the frightened submissive dog\u2014it will arch the back and fluff out the tail and body fur (piloerection) to look larger and stronger, open the mouth in a threatening way, and hiss or screech in order to frighten the perceived attacker or alarm other ferrets in the area. If not descented the ferret may empty or express its anal sacs, again much as a frightened dog would do. Depending on the level of socialization of the ferret, this fear response may also lead to biting.BOX 4-4Causes of Ferret Aggression or Biting Behavior\n\u2666Play aggression\u2014The most common underlying cause for biting in ferrets, this is a normal behavior, especially in young ferrets, that needs to be mitigated.\u2666Possessive aggression\u2014Aggressive behavior directed at humans or other pets that approach the ferret when it is in possession of something it values, usually a favorite toy. May be exacerbated by restricting the ferret's free time and space.\u2666Fear-related aggression\u2014Occurs when ferret is startled or poorly socialized and not used to handling. This type of aggression can occur as a result of punishment, traumatic experiences, or genetic factors.\u2666Predatory aggression\u2014A normal innate behavior of the polecat from which the ferret was domesticated. When directed toward people or other pets it results in a behavioral problem that may involve stalking, chasing, grasping, and biting.\u2666Redirected aggression\u2014Occurs when the harmful behavior is directed toward a person or pet that is not the original stimulus for the aggressive behavior. Occurs when a person or pet interferes with two ferrets that are playing hard.\u2666Maternal aggression\u2014Refers to aggressive behavior directed toward humans or other pets that approach a jill with her kits.\u2666Pain-induced or irritable aggression\u2014Caused by an underlying medical condition:\u2022Gastrointestinal foreign body, hairball, gastric ulcers\u2022Inflammatory bowel disease\u2022Hormonal changes associated with adrenal disease\u2022Any painful disease process\n\u2666Sexual aggression\u2014May explain conspecific ferret aggression in which mating behavior may be accompanied by intense biting.\n",

It is interesting to note that scruffing the ferret (restraining the ferret by holding the skin at the nape of the neck) often elicits a yawning reflex. This may facilitate a brief oral examination. The action of scruffing causes a relaxation response and is used as a form of restraint when necessary to calm an excited ferret. The relaxation elicited by scruffing is usually consistent and is similar to the method used by the jill when disciplining young kits or moving them from one location to another.6\n",

It has been shown that lack of negative gonadal hormonal feedback on hypothalamic GnRH in neutered ferrets results in persistently elevated gonadotropic LH, which may induce nonneoplastic\nand neoplastic adrenocortical enlargement.38 The ensuing hyperadrenocorticism may result in increases in plasma levels of estradiol, androstenedione, 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, which result in physical and behavioral changes dominated by features consistent with excessive production of these sex hormones.38 A diagnosis of adrenal disease based on history and clinical signs can be more definitively confirmed with ultrasonography of the adrenal glands and measurement of plasma levels of androstenedione, 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and estradiol (Clinical Endocrinology Service, University of Tennessee).",
