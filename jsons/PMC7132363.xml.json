Kawasaki's disease is most commonly found in the Asian population. In Japan, the incidence is 10 times greater than it is in Western countries. Kawasaki's disease has replaced acute rheumatic fever as the leading cause of acquired heart disease among children in developed countries. The annual incidence of Kawasaki's disease is approximately 150 per 100,000 children of Japanese descent aged less than 5 years and approximately 10 to 15 per 100,000 US children aged less than 5 years.",

Inflammation of the coronary arteries usually develops early in the acute phase until 4 weeks after onset of disease. Coronary artery biopsy specimens reveal that there is marked endothelial cell edema, proliferation, necrosis, and adhesion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to endothelium in these lesions. Specifically, there is an acute inflammatory response with elevated levels of circulating cytokines and CD4 and CD8 cells, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia on serum protein electrophoresis, and circulating IgG and IgM immunocomplexes.2, 3, 4\n",
