Poor quality air promotes the spread of respiratory and other communicable diseases (Portney and Mullahy, 1990), and even results in serious cardiovascular diseases (Brook et al., 2004), particularly for the very young and very old, and people with chronic diseases and those with immune deficiency. The alarming progressive degradation of air quality worldwide is attributable to the growth of manufacturing and resource industry in East and South Asia to meet the burgeoning demand for goods and services by a growing affluent population, a lack of control of air pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion to meet the demand for energy and the inadequacy of air ventilation in urban area where a large proportion of the world population reside (Alejo et al., 2010, Lu et al., 2012). Evidently, building arrays and street canyons have an undesirable impact on the ground level wind flow, air ventilation within the urban fabric, as well as the dispersion of air pollution; however wind\u2013structure interaction which governs the effects of buildings on atmospheric flow is often not properly considered when making urban development and urban planning decisions (Abd Razak et al., 2013).",

Among these elements, which one drives the spread of pollutant/respiratory ailment the most is still a controversial issue. For instance, after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2002, many researches have been reported to address the mechanisms of disease spreading. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether buoyancy effect or wind flow plays the more significant role (Niu and Tung, 2008, Yip et al., 2007, Zhou and Jiang, 2004, Li et al., 2005). Hence a reliable method is urgently needed for the assessment of air ventilation and air quality in urban environments.",

One of the advantages of wind tunnel test is that model testing in a wind tunnel produces a set of physical data. The physical data are reliable provided that the test processes and measurements are undertaken in accordance to established experimental methods. However, there are also obvious limitations of physical wind tunnel test: the building models must be scaled down to fit in the wind tunnel, which creates low resolution of the measurements; and the boundary effect of the wind tunnel cannot be fully eliminated from the test. Although the physical measurements obtained in a wind tunnel model test are reliable, a scaled model is not a true reproduction of the real world. The need to satisfy the governing scaling and similitude requirements, such as Reynolds Number and Froude Number scaling, remains a formidable challenge.",

According to previous attempts (Li et al., 2006, Moonen et al., 2006, Endalew et al., 2009, Chavez et al., 2011, Blocken et al., 2012), a numerical wind tunnel approach has a number of advantages. The calculation domain of a numerical wind tunnel is adjustable and different boundary conditions can be applied so that the boundary effects on the simulations are minimized. If the computational power is large enough to accommodate a proper calculation domain, a numerical wind tunnel can test life-size objects, so that the scale effect can be minimized. However, there are limitations for existing numerical wind tunnels. Most notably the adopted numerical method affects the simulated results, i.e. different numerical scheme, different grid arrangement may make significantly different predictions.",

There are a number of studies using two-equation RANS models, including k\u2212\u03b5, RNG-k\u2212\u03b5, realizable k\u2212\u03b5 (Kim and Baik, 1999, Tsai and Chen, 2004, Jicha et al., 2002). However, those predictions were not fully reliable; in some circumstances, the predictions contradict the physical data, which suggests that either the general turbulent models adopted have common deficiencies, or the whole calculation process was not properly controlled, in terms of the convergency, time step and mathematical accuracy. Therefore, in Li's paper (Li et al., 2006), it was clearly indicated that a standardized quality assurance procedure is required. Furthermore, Blocken et al. (Bert Blocken, 2004) concluded that when using CFD, the best that one can do for the validation is to conduct the wind tunnel experiments oneself for the particular configuration.",

It is well known that LES and K\u2212\u03c9\u2212SST models can give better predictions than others, but this is mostly meaningful in flow simulation. It has shown that the widely-used eddy-viscosity models in LES are not able to correctly predict time scales of turbulent mixing (He et al., 2002) and dispersions (Jin et al., 2010, Yang et al., 2008), which presents a new challenge for adopting LES in the study of pollutant dispersion. Often the improvement offered by these time-consuming models is not significant enough to justify the additional computational time. Furthermore, the measurements taken using conventional chemical probe are not accurate enough to necessitate model predictions of transient flow well in excess of the accuracy associated with physical measurements. Hence a standard k\u2212\u03b5 model was employed in the current numerical wind tunnel simulation. The model used in this paper is not dissimilar to that in commercial software, thus providing further advantages in using an in-house code with the self-developed eddy-viscosity models that are convenient to embed in the proposed numerical wind tunnel for this study and for future work.",

This cul-de-sac design mostly accommodates kitchens, bathrooms and/or toilets fitted with exhaust fans through which odorous and other contaminated/spent gas/air and steam are emitted into the generally poorly ventilated space bounded by the cul-de-sac. Experiments were conducted to study the pollutant dispersion around this complex building structure. The tracer gas used was air with a 10% propane concentration. The tracer gas was released through a flow-meter at a constant flow rate of 58.5 ml/s, and this flow rate was low enough to ensure that source momentum effects were not significant. The tracer gas was emitted at the same position within the re-entry at 3rd floor, with the emission at either windward or leeward relative to the incident wind direction. Measurement of tracer gas concentration at each floor in the re-entry area was carried out after the wind flow stabilised.

By adjusting the inlet condition (inlet velocity profile), the desired approaching velocity profile can be accomplished before reaching the building model. The numerical wind tunnel generated a turbulent boundary layer flow approaching the building model with a mean wind velocity profile with a power law exponent of approximately 0.23 and a global turbulence intensity of approximately 0.15 at the building model height. The comparison of targeting velocity profile and the approaching velocity profile is presented in Fig. 1 (c) which shows a good agreement, with the approaching wind speed at the building height (1 m) = 3.27 m/s, closely matching the experimental condition. Based on the approaching velocity and the model building width, the model test Reynolds number was around 2.2 \u00d7 105, suggesting the flow is a fully developed turbulent flow. 10% propane with a 58.5 ml/s volume flow rate was numerically emitted from within the re-entry at 3rd floor, as shown in Fig. 1(c).

The upward airflow can be observed, but the intensity of the flow is relatively weak in comparison with the case with re-entry. Evidently building shape significant affects the flow regime and correspondingly the pollution dispersion around the building. The current study focused primarily on a crucifix-form building with re-entry, and on a plain rectangular building for comparison purposes only. The flow regime around such prismatic bluff bodies with well-defined separation points is dominated by separated flow and the interaction of the separated shear layers with the building afterbody, particularly for the crucifix-form building with re-entry with its more complex afterbody shape. Correspondingly, the pollution dispersion is primarly driven by the wind\u2013structure interaction which in turn is characterised by the building shape.",

At an early post-emission Phase 1, mixing and dilution of the pollutant remains primarily inside the re-entry area. At an intermediate mixing Phase 2, the pollutant migrates out of the re-entry area where intense mixing takes place. At a quasi-steady dispersion Phase 3, the pollutant leaves the re-entry area and spreads into the surrounding. For Case A with a windward pollution emission at 3rd floor, the pollutant is driven downwards by the downwash, spreads horizontally at ground level to form the horseshoe vortex, and disperses downstream. For Case B with a leeward pollution emission at 3rd floor, the pollutant is driven upwards, discharges onto the roof and becomes entrained into the near wake. This upwards migration of pollutant in the leeward re-entry is consistent with near wake flow regime driven by wind\u2013structure interaction described earlier.",

The advantage of using HF as an air pollutant is that the issue of emission position can be fully discarded as HF was \u201cpatched\u201d in a field. Furthermore, HF is not a pollutant with specific components; the density of HF is adjustable. This feature allows further test on the effect of buoyancy force of air pollutant by increasing or decreasing the HF density.",

Haze is defined as the unexpected atmospheric phenomenon that leads to weak atmospheric visibility due to the moisture, dust, smoke, and vapor in the atmosphere, while fog is composed of fine liquid droplets suspended in the air near the ground. The formation of HF is a result of long-term air pollution and mostly happens in major cities in the world, thus affects public health of city dwellers. The characteristics of HF are that the source point of the pollutant is generally unspecified (the pollutant could be produced in the city or transferred from other places) and the components are uncertain (the aerosol includes both particular matters (PM) and gas-phase precursors such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxides (SOx)).",
