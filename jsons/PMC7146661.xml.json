For example, a search in Google Scholar retrieves more than 1,000 records since the initial report by WHO.4 Despite this abundant number of publications, it is difficult to differentiate the most useful information that would help patient care efforts. Most of the information about the scientific aspects of how COVID-19 affects MHD patients is in the form of preliminary reports that have not yet completed a peer-review process. This is not unexpected because the disease has not yet reached a peak in most parts of the world and the data are still being accumulated. Almost all data are from the epicenter of the disease in Wuhan and more recently from Italy, and the reports are being put together through heroic efforts of nephrologists who are under immense pressure, primarily to provide clinical care for scores of infected patients.",

Nevertheless, the information that has been put forward from the Northwest Kidney Centers indicated that the first reported death in the United States was a patient receiving MHD before infection (S. Watnick, personal communication, March 2020). At this time, there are some scattered reports that suggest that a handful of people who have become COVID-19 positive are receiving MHD, but there are no reports of any widespread transmission among MHD patients.",

Interestingly, a recent study examining detection of SARS-CoV-2 in different types of clinical specimens indicated that positivity was as low as 32% in pharyngeal swabs, with lower respiratory tract samples most often testing positive for the virus (in up to 93%).5 Currently, most patients are diagnosed using clinical criteria, although significant efforts are being placed on rapid high-throughput testing.",

Although the CDC guidance recommends use of face masks only for patients with symptoms or illness, certain large dialysis organizations have mandated their use by every MHD patient at every session, which may have important resource implications. Ideally, symptomatic patients should be dialyzed in a separate room (if available) with the door closed. If a separate room is not available, it is recommended that the treatment should be performed at a corner or end-of-row station, away from the main flow of traffic. In any case, the symptomatic patient should be separated by at least 6 feet from the nearest patient in all directions. Of note, CDC guidance does not require that COVID-19\u2013infected patients be treated in an airborne infection isolation room.",

In addition to keeping track of PPE inventory, additional efforts should be used for preserving PPE. These include but are not limited to prioritizing isolation gowns for procedures that generate aerosolized body fluids and for high-contact patient care activities, as well as implementing extended use of eye and face protection. Another crucial step that needs to be taken for optimal prevention and control of COVID-19 is management of human resources. Earlier reports from the epicenter of the pandemic and ongoing reports from other areas with high infection rates such as Italy describe excessive mental and physical burden on HCWs. Accordingly, efficient workforce utilization along with appropriate planning for peak disease activity is crucial. Each unit should create a back-up list for all positions that could be used in the event of a possible increase in disease activity or a decrease in workforce due to illness.",

The actions taken by government officials to promote social distancing, such as closing of schools, sporting events, and other businesses, are appropriate and encouraging steps. These somewhat onerous but necessary actions have resulted in reasonable control of the disease in several countries such as Taiwan. There are other lessons that outpatient hemodialysis facilities can learn from this pandemic, including the need for continuous and comprehensive data collection and the value of flexibility by regulatory agencies. Academic centers and large dialysis organizations should rapidly create data collection tools that can complement the basic clinical data collected by CDC and state health departments. Only then will we have reliable information to get ourselves prepared for the next inevitable epidemic. Regulatory agencies should allow temporary changes in telehealth regulations and patient care regulations such as allowing patients to swiftly move between health systems. To improve our responsiveness to emerging threats in the future, we also need reliable and comprehensive scientific data along with flexible regulatory guidance.",
