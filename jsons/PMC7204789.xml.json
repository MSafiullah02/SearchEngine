Considering the understanding of COVID-19 to date, enormous challenges exist in the management of hospitalised patients with mental disorders. China has issued a series of measures, including triage, infection prevention and control, and treatment, to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic in mental health hospitals.1 2 Hospitalised patients with mental disorders have emotional disturbances, behavioural disorders and and a history of long-term use of antipsychotic drugs. Physical and psychiatric symptoms of patients with mental disorders may worsen with the SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to difficulties in treatment and management. We have found no published studies on the clinical features of hospitalised psychiatric patients who have COVID-19. With these challenges in mind, we performed a comprehensive retrospective investigation of the clinical features of 21 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia who were suspected to have COVID-19 at a mental health hospital in Hubei Province, China. Further, we compared them with 30 clean hospitalised patients with schizophrenia at another mental health hospital in Hubei Province in order to better understand how COVID-19 influenced clinical outcomes.",

Owing to the outbreak of COVID-19, isolation wards were established on 30 January 2020 at one mental health hospital in Hubei Province. When patients in this mental health hospital showed the onset of respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough and/or new abnormal chest CT findings, they were transferred to the isolation wards as COVID-19 suspected cases. Hospitalised patients with schizophrenia who were suspected to have COVID-19 (COVID-19 suspected group) were recruited from one of the isolation wards at this mental health hospital from 30 January to 21 February 2020. Meanwhile 30 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia in the general ward who were not suspected to have COVID-19 (clean group) from a mental health hospital in Yichang (also in Hubei Province, 300 km away from Wuhan) were recruited using a convenience sampling method. The two aforementioned hospitals are large psychiatric hospitals in Hubei Province, providing outpatient and inpatient treatment for patients with severe mental illness. Most wards are of the closed type, and inpatients receive medication, psychological rehabilitation and physical therapy (figure 1).",

When the electronic medical records were unclear, we enquired with the doctors of the wards. The investigation was implemented without any intervention in the treatment of patients. After two doctors performed and verified the mental examinations, several scales were used to assess the emotional and mental symptoms of both groups. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)3 was used to assess the psychopathology associated with schizophrenia. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)4 was used to assess the perception of stress. The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA)5 and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD)6 were used to assess the severity of emotional symptoms. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)7 was used to assess the quality of sleep.",

We believed it was difficult to identify confirmed cases from a large number of suspected cases in the early phase of the outbreak. Identifying COVID-19 infection based on clinical symptoms and chest CT, rather than relying entirely on RT-PCR testing, helped patients receive timely treatment and reduced the risk of exposure among uninfected patients. In this study, only one patient had positive result on the third RT-PCR test, and although the remaining 20 patients were negative for at least two PCR tests, 11 (52.4%) met the diagnostic criteria for clinically confirmed cases. False-positive results of the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 have been reported due to clinical course, specimen collection and detection process,8 through which some patients may be underdiagnosed. In this study, some patients had abnormalities on chest CT without respiratory symptoms, and more than half of patients had chest CT findings before the onset of respiratory symptoms. Recent studies have reported patients with chest CT findings who initially had negative results in the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and finally positive results.9 10 The asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 were not well understood and such cases bring challenges to infection control,11 12 particularly in places with closed management such as mental health hospitals. Therefore, according to the fifth edition of the guideline on COVID-19 in China (valid from 5\u201319 February),13 14 timely centralised isolation of patients with suspected symptoms at that time had positive significance in controlling the spread of the epidemic at the mental health hospital.",

Longitudinal studies focusing on patients with schizophrenia who have COVID-19 are required in the future. Second, patients in the COVID-19 suspected group and clean group were recruited from different hospitals and the assessments were performed by different doctors, which may cause bias. In order to reduce bias, we selected two mental health hospitals with similar scales in Wuhan, and the doctors who performed the assessment of patients were at least attending doctors. Third, follow-up of patients in the COVID-19 suspected group is needed to reveal more details with regard to clinical characteristics.",
