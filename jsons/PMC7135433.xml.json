            "text": "Silver is increasingly being used in consumer and healthcare products as an antibacterial agent. Data on the production and use of antibacterial silver in consumer products indicate distinct growth in its use over time. The use of antibacterial silver in Europe was estimated to total 30 tonnes per year in 2004, increasing to 110\u2013230 tonnes per year as of 2010 (Blaser et al., 2008). Antibacterial silver sometimes occurs in the form of silver nanomaterials, or \u201cnanosilver.\u201d Nanomaterials are often defined as materials with at least one dimension in the size range of 1\u2013100 nm, and there is an ongoing discussion among regulators and scientists, regarding risks and sustainability of nanotechnology (Ellenbecker and Tsai, 2011, Helland and Kastenholz, 2008). Regarding nanosilver more specifically, the question is whether it poses a higher, lower, or similar risk compared with that of ordinary, non-nanomaterial silver (Luoma, 2008). According to the most comprehensive database on nanomaterials in consumer products, nanosilver is by far the most common nanomaterial present, used in about a quarter of all products included in the database. The number of products containing nanosilver increased tenfold from 2006 to 2012 (Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies, 2012).",

An umbrella term, E&SAs include several approaches and methods, such as lifecycle assessment, risk analysis, material and substance flow analysis, cost\u2013benefit analysis, strategic environmental assessment, ecological footprint analysis, and multi-criteria analysis (see Finnveden and Moberg, 2005, Ness et al., 2007). In pursuing the second aim of this study, with regard to the arguments and evaluations advanced in the public controversy, we address which of these approaches and methods have been applied in assessments of antibacterial silver, as well as the results of these assessments. This overview, in turn, indicates potential venues where E&SAs can inform the public debate. However, comparing the arguments made in the public controversy with these current assessments reveals challenges and limitations when it comes to informing the public debate over antibacterial silver.",

            "text": "We understand a controversy to be a situation involving two or more actors who advance incompatible standpoints (e.g. beliefs, attitudes, and goals) regarding an issue. When questioned by an opponent, actors involved in a controversy are motivated to provide reasons for their standpoints (Toulmin, 1958/2003). We understand an argument to constitute the reasons that support or weaken a standpoint or another argument (Blair, 2012, N\u00e6ss, 1961, Walton, 1990). The standpoints of the controversy examined here concern the evaluation of antibacterial silver as a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d thing, which in turn motivates consumer and regulatory action. Inspired by the argumentative schemes of association and dissociation suggested by Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca (1958/1969) and applied to risk communication by Corvellec and Boholm (2008), we suggest that a verbal argumentative controversy centered on incompatible evaluations of a certain phenomenon x, for example, antibacterial silver, can be analyzed in terms of a set of basic theoretical elements. These elements are: (1) evaluations, i.e. verbal acts of (a) association or (b) dissociation (i.e. separation) between x and (a) positive value or (b) negative value (see Table 1\n), and (2) arguments, i.e. verbally articulated reasons (a) supporting or (b) weakening the associations or dissociations in (1). For example, the claim that \u201csilver is toxic\u201d is a negative evaluation that associates silver with the negative value of toxicity. The claim that \u201cscientific studies demonstrate that silver is toxic to marine organisms\u201d serves as an argument supporting this negative evaluation.",

Our focus is not on the use of silver in general, which includes many other applications, for example in jewelry, electronics and photography development. We have no restriction with regard to any particular form of silver used for antibacterial purposes, for example nanosilver, colloidal silver or silver salt. Societal actors outside the scientific community do not always pay attention to such technical specifications of silver. Often, there is a general and vague reference to just \u201csilver\u201d.

The two strategically added newspapers are the local regional morning paper of the city of Bor\u00e5s, i.e. Bor\u00e5s tidning, and the national weekly newspaper Ny Teknik. The former was included because the city of Bor\u00e5s is the location of the Swedish School of Textiles at the University of Bor\u00e5s and silver is increasingly used in textiles. The latter was added because of its focus on technology, engineering, and innovation. To exclude hundreds of irrelevant hits in the newspaper article search, negative keywords were used, for example, \u201csilvertejp\u201d (silver tape, i.e. duct tape). Concerning news coverage on Sweden's major television channels, two news features on antibacterial silver aired on the privately owned TV4 were found, transcribed, and included in the analysis. Searching the archives of the Swedish public service television company (SVT) available on the Internet, no aired TV news coverage of antibacterial silver was identified, but the SVT website did present written information on antibacterial silver, which was included in the analysis. Three companies were analyzed: Polygiene is the Swedish manufacturer of a silver-based antibacterial product applied to clothes, sports gear, and hard surfaces; Gryyab is the sewage treatment utility of the Gothenburg region in southwest Sweden; and Addnature is one of Sweden's major retailers of outdoor and adventure equipment and clothing.",

What arguments are used to support these evaluations? In an interpretative and iterative process carried out by the authors, using Atlas.ti software, categories for evaluations and arguments (\u201ccodes\u201d in Atlas.ti) were assigned to actual segments of the analyzed texts (\u201cquotations\u201d in Atlas.ti). As defined above (see Table 1), the evaluation categories are: positive association (e.g. \u201csilver is good\u201d), positive dissociation (e.g. \u201csilver is not bad\u201d), negative association (e.g. \u201csilver is bad\u201d), and negative dissociation (e.g. \u201csilver is not good\u201d). In Section 2.1, an argument is defined as a reason supporting or weakening a standpoint (a primary argument) or another argument (a secondary argument). Corresponding to the four forms of evaluations, four categories of primary arguments have been used in coding: argument supporting a positive association, argument supporting a positive dissociation, argument supporting a negative association, and argument supporting a negative dissociation. In turn, four categories of secondary arguments follow, each corresponding to the four categories of primary argument, i.e. argument supporting an argument supporting a positive association, argument supporting an argument supporting a positive dissociation, etc. This coding process thus assigns categories predefined by theory (\u201ccodes\u201d) to what is actually stated in the text (\u201cquotations\u201d). For example, the utterance that \u201csilver is a risk\u201d has been assigned the code negative association and the claim \u201cscientific studies demonstrate that silver is toxic to marine organisms,\u201d in support of this claim, has been assigned the code argument supporting a negative association. The resulting set of quotations for each code was in turn analyzed to find general and systematic patterns with regard to the principal values at stake in the evaluations (e.g. environment and health) and the content of arguments; below, the types of arguments are referred to using small capital letters, for example, toxic argument.",

As an environmental issue, marine organisms are exposed when silver emissions reach water, but there is also the worry that terrestrial organisms may be affected when polluted sludge is spread on farmland.

It is also claimed that antibacterial silver makes it possible to wash clothes clean at a lower temperature (low-temperature argument), which reduces energy use even further. Since less frequent washing of a garment will make it last longer (last long argument), clothing consumption will be reduced (less consumption argument), which also reduces environmental impact. That silver products kill (malign) bacteria (antibacterial argument) is invoked to support the last long argument more directly than by reducing washing, in that silver is said to kill bacteria that break down clothing fibers. Another form of reasoning about how silver reduces environmental impact is the light travel argument. According to this argument, one can bring less clothing when traveling: since silver-treated clothing stays fresh longer, there is less need to change clothes because they smell sweaty. Related to the less detergent argument is the avoids toxic substance argument, i.e. since silver is used to kill bacteria, the alternative and allegedly more dangerous substance triclosan is avoided.",

Given the wide range of conflicting arguments for and against antibacterial silver use, and the justification of claims by invoking expert authority, we raise the following questions: What E&SA approaches and methods, relevant to this public controversy, have been applied to antibacterial silver, and what are the results of these assessments? As a first step towards answering the first question, a Scopus query (see http://www.scopus.com/home.url) has been made using the search string \u201c(antibacterial OR antimicrobial OR biocidal) AND (silver OR nanosilver) AND assessment\u201d in article titles, abstracts and keywords. From the set of 246 articles that was identified by this Scopus query, only those applying an E&SA approach (Finnveden and Moberg, 2005, Ness et al., 2007) were selected for further analysis. In addition, however, the in-press risk assessment study of antibacterial silver in clothes by Arvidsson et al. (inpress) was included as it is known to the authors and due to its relevance for the purpose of this study.",

Four E&SA approaches (Finnveden and Moberg, 2005, Ness et al., 2007) has been applied in these studies: substance flow analysis (SFA), risk analysis (RA), multi-criteria analysis (MCA), and lifecycle assessment (LCA) (see Table 4\n). In SFA the magnitudes of the societal stocks, flows, and emissions of a specific substance are typically assessed. An SFA study can be regional or global, or related to a specific product group, and is mainly used to assess resource use and emissions of toxic substances (van der Voet, 2002). In RA the risk of a specific substance to specific organisms is quantified based on toxicity and exposure data. This method can tell whether a specific substance constitutes a risk to humans or to organisms in the environment, yet it is limited to environmental and health impacts of the substance itself (van Leeuwen and Vermeire, 2007). Furthermore, RA is unable to assess positive impacts from a substance. In MCA different alternatives are evaluated and ranked based on preselected criteria. Although this method is inclusive when it comes to which negative and positive impacts that can be included, MCA has been criticized for being subjective (Dobes and Bennett, 2010). In LCA various environmental impacts are quantified for a specific product or service. LCA is inclusive when it comes to environmental impacts (and benefits), but some environmental impacts are problematic to assess in LCA (Finnveden et al., 2009). In addition, impacts and benefits over and above those related to the environment or human health are typically not included in LCA, although pioneering work is being done to extend the method into other sustainability aspects (UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative, 2011).",

For sure, some of the arguments advanced in the controversy are hardly the type of issues that are enlightened by science at all, i.e. the sweat is ok and nature over silver benefits arguments. Whether sweat is ok and whether nature is more important than the benefits of silver (e.g. reducing smell) are arguably genuine matters of opinion that could be subject to ethical analysis, but not through using E&SAs, at least not in any traditional sense.",

Friends of the Earth, 2011). In being so closely related to many of the arguments discussed in Sections 3.5, 3.6, this body of research is indeed highly relevant to informing the debate and evaluating many of the health-related arguments. However, as is clear from the above overview of the debate, many concerns have been raised and many arguments advanced, so evaluating individual arguments can only partly contribute to a more general assessment of antibacterial silver. Specific findings need to be integrated into more holistic assessment methods to obtain more comprehensive results for consumers and decision-makers (i.e. recommending whether silver-containing products should or should not be bought, banned, or restricted); such a holistic aim is typical of E&SAs (Ness et al., 2007).",

As in MCA, the various environmental impacts included in an LCA study are sometimes aggregated into a single number, which is called \u201cweighting\u201d (Baumann and Tillman, 2004). Such weightings are based on values and preferences, or more precisely on, for example, (i) the estimated costs of the environmental damage and the value of the resources used, (ii) international and national targets for the environmental problems in question, and (iii) the opinions of experts or leading politicians. However, such weighting methods are contested and some consider them too subjective to be used (Johnsen and L\u00f8kke, 2013); notably, the two identified LCA studies of antibacterial silver (see Table 4) did not conduct weighting.",

Still, such overall assessment is arguably important to enable E&SAs to better address the full range of concerns expressed by public and government actors, as in the case of antibacterial silver. In light of this criticism, it seems that work remains to be done to develop E&SAs into better supports for consumers and decision-makers. The controversy over antibacterial silver is not the only case in which a product is arguably beneficial in some senses but hazardous in others. The debate over, for example, nuclear power is in many ways similar in structure (Pampel, 2011). Proponents argue that nuclear power produces low greenhouse gas emissions, while opponents cite the radioactive waste and the risk of fatal accidents. Arguments related to resources, toxic substances, and human health are advanced in that controversy as well. We see a great potential for E&SAs to inform such societal controversies, both now and in the future. It is hoped that future E&SAs can be developed to better handle the potentially wide variety of issues actualized in public controversy, in a convincing and unified way.",

            "text": "Given the wide variety, complexity, and nature of the concerns raised in this public controversy, we turn to E&SAs for guidance. Many of the identified arguments are covered by four different types of E&SA, i.e. substance flow analysis, life cycle assessment, multi-criteria analysis, and risk analysis. We therefore conclude that E&SAs can play an important role in informing the controversy at hand. However, we also note that some arguments, most notably related to public health and bacterial resistance, are not covered. The reasons for this divergence can be many, for example: the interests of public actors such as the media and E&SA scientists differ; similarly, different actors work and communicate within different contexts of institutional requirements, possibilities and restrictions; and by tradition, E&SAs focus on some aspects (e.g. toxicity and emissions) rather than others (e.g. bacteria resistance). Furthermore, besides the point that not all arguments are covered, it is far from clear how the wide variety of arguments can be handled in a single framework. These current limitations suggest a direction for the further development of E&SAs, to improve their ability to inform the public controversy over antibacterial silver, as well as societal controversy in general. In order to make an even more significant societal contribution, future E&SAs of antibacterial silver should address, incorporate and seek guidance from the wide variety of actual concerns articulated in society. By so doing, results of E&SAs will arguably be more relevant for stakeholders. In turn, this will require that theory and methods of E&SAs are developed in innovative ways, in order to cover, in a comprehensive manner, the wider set of issues actualized in public debate. Despite any such efforts, there will, in the end, probably be a need to acknowledge the limitations of E&SAs to fully inform every concern raised in public controversy (Tukker, 2000).",
