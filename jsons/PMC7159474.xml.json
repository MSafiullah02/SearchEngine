However, because of the limited sensitivity of the methods used, the frequency of viral detection was low, ranging from 14 to 49% (4). With the introduction of molecular detection methods, the role of viruses in acute asthma exacerbations (AAE) has been increasingly appreciated. Typically, in a French study of children hospitalized for a severe AAE, PCR detected a viral agent in about 82% of the cases, while more traditional methods (virus culture and immunofluorescence) identified only 34% (5). Using molecular detection, between 62% and 95% of children with acute wheezing episodes test positive for respiratory viruses (with most studies reporting a prevalence of over 80%), in both hospital and community settings (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20). The prevalence in adults is less, but still in the range of 41\u201378% (21, 22, 23, 24, 25). This may be because of real differences or to the fact that adults produce and shed less infective virus and/or that recent studies using PCR are not many.",

Variability within the above studies can be explained by differences in methodologies, sampling, seasonality, duration, age distribution and more. It should be pointed out that in temperate climates RV induces disease mostly in the fall and spring, in association with return from school holidays and is the major pathogen behind the September asthma epidemic (18). Seasonality may be different in tropical climates (37).",

In a French study of 132 nasal aspirates from 75 children hospitalized for a severe attack of asthma, CP and MP were identified by PCR in 4.5% and 2.2%, respectively (5). In another population of children hospitalized for severe asthma, MP was identified in 20% of 119 children with known asthma and in 50% of 51 children hospitalized because of their first asthma attack. The frequency of CP was lower (3.4% and 6%, respectively). Asthma recurred among 62% of those in whom an atypical pathogen was diagnosed, but in only 27% of patients not infected with an atypical pathogen, suggesting an effect of MP in initiation and recurrence of asthma (86). Lehtinen et al. determined bacterial co\u2010infections in 220 children hospitalized for acute wheezing with defined viral etiology. Bacterial co\u2010infections were more frequent (22%) for patients positive for RV, compared to children positive for other respiratory viruses; MP was the second most frequent bacterial species identified, with an incidence of 5% (87).",

In another study of 82 acute asthmatic children in northern France, 5% were infected with CP and an additional 5% with MP. Persistent symptoms and reduced recovery after 3 weeks were more frequently associated with atypical bacterial infections compared to viral infections (8). In a study from Turkey including 79 asthmatic children (37 with acute asthma attacks, 42 with stable asthma) and 36 healthy controls, significantly higher MP\u2010 and CP\u2010specific IgM was found between the acute asthma and the other two groups (90).",

The relationship with different wheezing illnesses is also clear for RSV, which is mostly prevalent in infants.

As breakthroughs in microorganism detection become available for epidemiological use, in parallel to bioinformatics tools for their analysis, extensive virology and bacteriology should become a vital part of longitudinal cohort studies, aiming at better understanding the kinetics and natural history of microbial exposures, and reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention. Such interventions will also be needed to confirm causality behind the described associations.",
