We know that during sleep there is production of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines, however, production of inflammatory cytokines is observed in sleep deprivation. In the experimental study by Nunes et al. [2] , it was possible to demonstrate that mice in sleep deprivation had more inflammatory cytokines than those allowed for good quality sleep. In addition, mice in sleep deprivation after corticotherapy (dexamethasone) were not able to reduce production of IL-17 and TNFalpha in the same way as mice that had good quality of sleep. Thus, this study shows that sleep deprivation aggravated the inflammatory process in lung tissue, and limited the action of corticotherapy. Given this scenario, I pose the following question: Is sleep deprivation able to negatively interfere with the lung picture of COVID-19?",

Thus, I would like to suggest an investigation of sleep deprivation to patients with COVID-19, and ask a second question: Would the use of melatonin, especially in elderly patients in sleep deprivation with COVID-19, in an early and even preventive way, be able to reduce the injury in the lung tissue of these patients?",
