All three properties of publicness-i.e., nonrivalry of benefits, nonexcludability of nonpayers, and the aggregation technology-play a role in this prognosis. The paper highlights many provision impediments, not faced by national or global public goods. When intervention is necessary, the analysis distinguishes the role of global, regional, and other institutional arrangements (e.g., networks and publicprivate partnerships). The pros and cons of subsidiarity are addressed.",

            "text": "In recent years, there is a growing interest in the study of GPGs and TPGs beginning with Global Challenges (Sandler, 1997) and followed by other contributions (see, e.g., Ferroni and Mody, 2002; Kanbur, Sandler and Morrison, 1999; Kaul, Grunberg and Stern, 1999; Kaul, Concei\u00e7\u00e3 o, Le Goulven, and Mendoza, 2003; Sandler, 1998 Sandler, , 2004 . Some studies focus on RPGs and their associated collective action problems (Arce and Sandler, 2002; Cook and Sachs, 1999; Estevadeordal, Frantz and Nguyen, 2004; Sandler, 1998 Sandler, , 2002 St\u00e5 lgren, 2000) , while others analyze GPGs and their provision efforts to date. A primary concern is to distinguish TPGs for which nations have the proper incentives to contribute from those where incentives are perverse. Another concern is to identify the role of diverse agents and international organizations-i.e., global (e.g., World Bank, United Nations) institutions, regional institutions, networks, public-private partnerships, and charitable foundations-in bolstering TPG provision in developing countries. In recent years, increased foreign assistance has been channeled in a bilateral and multilateral fashion to finance TPGs in developing countries. Based on data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), te Velde, Morrissey and Hewitt (2002: 128) show that aid-funded public good support more than doubled from 16.22% of assistance in 1980-82 to 38.19% in 1996-98. 2 Much of this increase was in terms of NPGs: in 1996-98, 29 .40% of official assistance funded NPGs compared with 8.79% for TPGs (te Velde et al., 2002: 126-127) .",

In accomplishing the first goal, the modern study of public goods and collective action (Olson, 1965; Sandler, 1992 Sandler, , 2004 is applied to assess the effectiveness of the support for RPGs in developing countries. All three properties of publicness-nonrivalry of benefits, nonexcludability of nonpayers, and the aggregation technology (i.e., how individual contributions add to the overall level for consumption)-indicate where to direct efforts in providing RPGs. Blanket statements about RPGs must be resisted since these goods display a wide range of publicness properties and prognoses. Once the prognosis is understood, the role of national and international institutions in promoting the supply of RPGs and GPGs in developing countries will be known. 1 Benefits are nonrival when a unit of the good can be consumed by one agent without detracting, in the least, from the consumption possibilities still available for other agents from the same unit. Benefits are nonexcludable when they are available to all would-be consumers once the good is supplied. 2 Estimates by Raffer (1999) indicate that support for public goods varied from 20% to 40% of official development assistance in the 1990s, depending on the classification of public goods used. The growth of aid-supported public goods is further documented in a recent study by Mascarenhas and Sandler (2005) . Also see the World Bank (2001) study, which distinguishes between complementary and core activities. Complementary activities lay the infrastructure for developing countries to consume TPGs-the so-called core activity. The former require NPGs that prepare the country to benefit from TPGs.",

In many instances, intervention may not be needed, but, when required, the form of intervention and the requisite institutional arrangement hinge on the publicness properties of the RPGs. Hence, this taking stock of RPGs is essential. An RPG provides benefits to two or more nations in a well-defined region. A region is a territorial subsystem of the global system, whose basis may be geological (based on earth formations such as a plain or coastline), geographical, political, cultural, or geoclimatic. Regional characteristics can influence the extent of spillovers from a public good-e.g., language can facilitate or limit spillovers, while natural barriers, such as mountain ranges, may also affect the range of spillovers. Because agricultural research findings are specific to soil and climatic conditions, geoclimatic factors can be the prime determinant of the range of the resulting spillovers. Thus, knowledge public goods can be regional in nature. Diseases and pests may be indigenous to some regions so that defensive measures may yield RPGs.",

Nonexclusion results in a market failure because a provider cannot keep noncontributors from consuming the good's benefit. Once the public good is provided, consumers have no incentive to contribute because their money can purchase other goods whose benefits are not freely available. Thus, the public good will be either undersupplied or not supplied. Benefit nonrivalry means that extending consumption to additional users results in a zero marginal cost. Exclusionbased fees are inefficient because some potential users, who derive a positive gain, are denied access even though it costs society nothing to include them. Purely public RPGs include cleansing a local ecosystem, curbing the spread of an infectious disease, curing a region-specific disease, and instituting regional flood control.",

An example is a common property resource, such as a regional fishing ground, where access is open to all nations in the region. Rivalry applies because increased fishing effort by one nation limits the catch of other nations through crowding. To haul in the same catch, each nation's fleet must exert more effort as that of other nations increases. This problem can be addressed if a regional body restricts fishing efforts to account for the crowding externality. Nations are not anticipated to reduce overexploitation on their own unless there is a nation with a sufficiently large stake in the fishery and/or the ability to impose restrictions on others.",

The partial exclusion indicates that some of the users can be denied entry unless they pay the toll. The lack of complete excludability means that there will still be some free riders who will use the good, crowd others, and escape payment.

The toll charges each user the same fee, which equals the crowding costs associated with a standardized unit of use or visit. Taste differences among members can be taken into account: members with a stronger preference for the club good will use it more frequently and will thus pay more in aggregate tolls.

If, instead, this ratio approaches zero so that all jointly produced benefits are nonexcludable, then underprovision and/or overutilization will result and intervention is needed. Since this ratio can assume any value between zero and one, many scenarios are possible. Institutional design can endogenize this ratio so that collective action can be fostered by augmenting country-specific and excludable benefits to provide incentives to potential supporters.

The measure of the number of diseased patients treated equals their sum. In addition, the quantity of regional parks and/or rain forest preserved corresponds to the sum of hectares protected. A distinguishing feature of summation is that every contributor's efforts are perfectly substitutable for those of others; one nation's unit of provision has the same impact on the total level of the public good as a unit supplied by anyone else. Without exclusion, free-rider incentives are then a prime concern because another nation's provision limits the need for the nation to contribute.

A number of implications are essential for understanding the provision problem posed by RPGs, associated with the three properties of publicness. First, nonrivalry and nonexcludability of benefits are insufficient to gauge the prognosis for RPG provision. This is aptly illustrated by a weakest-link purely public good, where the classic public good properties suggest a bad provision prognosis. When, however, these properties are coupled with weakest link, the supply outlook is promising if the agents have similar tastes and income. This follows because free riding is no longer an option. Second, club RPGs can be efficiently provided by the members when tolls account for crowding. This efficient outcome holds for all aggregators except weakest link, for which externalities from undersupply or poor maintenance may not be fully internalized. Third, joint products' RPGs can be adequately supplied whenever there is a large share of excludable benefits. This share can be raised through institutional innovation that engineer contributor-specific benefits (Sandler, 2004: 90-97) . Fourth, a weightedsum technology may support RPG supply whenever there is sufficient weight on the country's own efforts relative to other countries' efforts. Fifth, weakest-link type aggregators highlight the importance of capacity, while best-shot type of aggregators (including threshold) underscore the importance of coordination and/or pooling of In some weakest-link situations, the added capacity may come in the form of an in-kind transfer intended to attain an acceptable provision standard. Sixth, the primary concern arises when these weakest-link and best-shot RPGs hold little interest for rich countries in other regions. In these cases, there may be little choice but to rely on global and regional institutions, or new participants.",

An understanding of this uniqueness is essential to prescribe the proper intervention and the appropriate international organization, if any, to assist. By benefiting residents, NPGs provide adequate incentives for the recipient nation to assume a loan to underwrite the good-sufficient ownership exists. There is no free-riding issue among nations since, by their nature, these goods' benefits do not spill over to other nations. By supplying the social overhead capital required for development, NPGs play a complementary role in setting the stage for developing countries to take advantage of TPGs (World Bank, 2001) . GPGs and TPGs offer spillover benefits for donor nations outside of the recipient region. This last realization suggests that there are considerations that inhibit RPG provision when compared with GPGs. Many researchers have solely emphasized the supportive factors that favor RPG provision over GPGs. 4 RPGs involve fewer nations than GPGs which can favor collective action at the regional level. By limiting uncertainty, spatial and cultural propinquity foster RPG provision compared with GPGs where all cultures are present. In recent years, the rise in regionalism has given birth to regional trading blocs as well as a greater regional identity (Mansfield and Milner, 1999) . These trading blocs supply some of the requisite infrastructure to facilitate RPG provision-e.g., trading blocs can offer collateral for loans, supply RPGs, or coordinate supply efforts. The European Union (EU) has been instrumental in coordinating RPG provision in Europe, where the EU spearheaded action to curb acid rain and other regional pollutants. In addition, many RPGs possess some favorable publicness properties that foster provision. For example, the underlying aggregation technology for curbing surface ozone is weighted sum in which nations experience the greatest share of their own pollutants, thereby motivating action. A final favorable influence is that of past and ongoing interactions among regional participants, which mean that defecting from an agreement can result in subsequent punishment. Unlike the global level, nations are in constant contact at the regional level so that short-run gains from reneging on an agreement may not justify the long-term retribution.",

These rivalries have been fueled by neighborhood civil wars, whose economic consequences have adversely affected neighboring nations (Murdoch and Sandler, 2004) . Since the late 1990s, civil wars have plagued many developed countries, thereby hampering growth and the support of RPGs (Collier et al., 2003) . These civil wars not only destroy social overhead capital in war-torn countries but also induce peaceful countries to erect expensive firewalls to limit harmful consequences.

There has been a lack of a global culture to support regional development banks, which has limited their capacity to support RPGs. Donors have traditionally turned to the global institutions to channel some of their support to developing countries and their public good needs. This culture is changing as regionalism, a localized form of globalization, takes hold. If this transformation is to make a difference, then regional development banks must also change their practices. One study shows that these banks gave tiny percentages of their foreign assistance in the form of TPGs (which includes RPGs) during 1996-98: 4.18%, African Development Fund; 6.86%, Asian Development Bank; and 1.97%, Inter-American Development Bank (te Velde et al., 2002: 126) . In contrast, these institutions gave large aid percentages to NPGs during 1996-98: 34.73%, African Development Fund; 47.34%, Asian Development Bank; and 69.15%, Inter-American Development Bank (te Velde et al., 2002: 127) . Even more worrying is that the percentage of aid in support of TPGs has fallen since 1980-this is not encouraging for these institutions to bolster RPG support! In a subsequent study, Mascarenhas and Sandler (2005) establish that the regional development banks did not tailor their loan-grant mix to reflect the degree of publicness of supported activities. Loans are more appropriate when recipientspecific benefits dominate, while grants are appropriate when regionwide benefits dominate. Essentially, regional development banks applied a fixed percentage for the various functional areas-e.g., the environment, governance, and knowledgeunlike bilateral donors and global institutions that tailored this mix to publicness considerations. This is additional evidence that these banks must adjust their procedures if they are to warrant enhanced funding. These banks can perform an essential role to address another inhibiting factor of RPG provision-i.e., the absence of a clear entity to obtain loans, provide collateral, and promote a regional agenda. This role must be assumed by either a dominant nation in the region, if one exists, or a regional trading bloc. The regional development banks can then work together with one or both of these entities to fund RPGs. Table 2 provides a summary of the factors that favor and inhibit support of RPGs, compared with their GPG counterparts. What must be emphasized is that RPGs face many impediments, despite their smaller set of nations, that do not confront GPGs. For RPGs, many difficulties stem from the lack of the necessary infrastructure and inexperience in supporting regionwide needs. Merely giving more money to regional development banks will not fix the problem unless explicit action is taken to earmark funds to RPGs. Measures are also needed to prepare regional trading blocs and organizations to represent the region's interest in supplying RPGs.",

When regions are too poor to support sufficient RPGs, regional development banks and other donors can underwrite these regional institutions to achieve subsidiarity. By matching political and economic domains, subsidiarity fosters efficiency because the RPG's marginal benefit (summed over regional recipients) is equated to its marginal cost. Another benefit of subsidiarity is that it limits transaction costs by reducing the number of participants to just those with a stake in the decision. As these participants interact over time, incentives are fostered to abide by agreements, thereby reducing enforcement cost. Repeated interactions also lessen asymmetric information and its associated transaction costs. Localized regional benefits increase the evolution of regional institutions from shared culture, norms, concerns, experiences, and values (North, 1990) . As in a fiscal federal system, region-based provision may also lead to best-practice innovations that can be copied by other regional institutions. Centralized provision at the supranational level inhibits such innovations. Greater reliance on regional institutions avoids Bmission creep^as global institutions have assumed an ever-wider array of activities.

Economies of scale can justify having an RPG provided by an institution whose political domain exceeds that of the requisite region whenever the reduced unit cost offsets any lost efficiency. In a global institution, economies of scale may arise from fixed costs that can be spread over serving the needs of multiple regions. For example, peacekeeping would be more expensive per deployment than UN peacekeeping if each region maintains its own peacekeeping forces and equipment. Another factor that limits the application of subsidiarity are economies of scope associated with providing two or more TPGs in the same institution. Economies of scope come from unit cost savings as common inputs (e.g., a communication network or administrative staff) are used to supply these TPGs. Because the spillover range from two or more TPGs is unlikely to coincide, the common provision of multiple TPGs by a single institution is not expected to satisfy subsidiarity.

For example, the available regional institution may not entirely match the RPG's spillover range. In the case of river blindness (Onchocerciasis), the disease affected three different regions-Latin America, Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula. Either a new jurisdiction had to be cobbled together by linking three separate regions or else one region has to take up the cause for the other regions. A public-private partnership (i.e., Onchocerciasis Control Partnership) between Merck, the World Health Organization (WHO), host countries to the disease, and donors formed to address river blindness, in which Merck contributed Ivermectin to control the disease and the other partners assisted in the drug's distribution. For some best-shot, better-shot, and threshold RPGs, the required effort may necessitate pooling resources beyond the jurisdiction identified by subsidiarity. This is relevant for actions against communicable diseases in those regions that lack sufficient research facilities and medical personnel. For the search of an HIV/AIDS vaccine, the requisite research infrastructure only exists in a few countries outside the most threatened regions. Table 3 summarizes supporting and detracting influences on the application of the subsidiarity principle for the provision of RPGs. The new regionalism should over time result in more capable regional institutions, as it has in Europe. As regional institutions are strengthened, subsidiarity can be applied to a greater extent; however, subsidiarity is not always desirable. When scale and scope economies are significant or pooled efforts are required owing to best-shot considerations, either global institutions must step in or else regional institutions must coordinate efforts across regions.

            "text": "Since the late 1960s the global incidence of civil wars increased until 1988, at which time it fell somewhat before leveling off at an elevated high level. Conflict-torn countries are associated with refugees, trade disruption, poverty, low economic growth, diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS and malaria), and financial instability. In terms of the latter, civil wars lead on average to a flight of ten percent of a country's capital (Collier et al., 2003: 15) . Reducing intrastate and interstate conflict is one activity that can simultaneously contribute to many RPG issue areas. Conflict may not only spread from one country to the next, but may also generate a wide range of negative externalities, whose reduction represents RPGs. In a recent study, Murdoch and Sandler (2004) show that regional wars can reduce a nearby peaceful country's growth by about one half of a percentage point; thus, four regional conflicts will wipe out most countries' growth in the region. Security concerns also arise from terrorism. Although transnational terrorism has fallen since the early 1990s, each incident is now more likely to result in casualties (Sandler and Enders, 2004; Enders and Sandler, 2006) . The four hijackings on 11 September, 2001, (hereafter 9/11) underscore that a well-planned attack can have significant consequences in lives and economic losses. Transnational terrorism is associated with a Btransference externality^in which increased protection taken in one location transfers the attack to less secure venues in other countries or regions. This suggests that security against transnational terrorism is a GPG necessitating global coordination. For example, attacks against Americans in the Middle East and elsewhere motivate U.S. willingness to bolster defenses abroad if requested. Since the rise of fundamentalist terrorism after 1979, there has been a shift of transnational terrorism to the Middle East and Asia (see Enders and Sandler, 2005) . This shift is quite dramatic after 9/11 and the subsequent upgrades to U.S. homeland security.",

In Afghanistan, the defeat of the Taliban resulted in a weaker government that has been unable to control poppy cultivation-an unintended global public bad resulting from antiterrorism action in the wake of 9/11. Thus, security actions in one region cannot necessarily be isolated from consequences in other regions. Proactive measures against transnational terrorism, WMD proliferation, and organized crime represent a best-shot public good. Even if the action is regionspecific, the associated threat is mobile and so such measures constitute GPGs rather than RPGs. In contrast, defensive actions to forestall the spread of terrorism, weapon proliferation, or crime is a weakest-link public good. Defensive measures also have global implications owing to transference of terrorists or criminals to safe havens and their attacks to soft targets. Most regions do not possess the military prowess to act proactively; hence, regions generally resort to venue-shifting defensive actions. At some point, the world must realize that much of today's security threats must be addressed on a worldwide scale by global institutions and powerful alliances when there is a sufficient consensus to legitimize a proactive response.

The global community must first provide the complementary NPGs, including improving educational attainment, for poor regions. Networks can then be relied upon to pool resources and expertise across regions to achieve best-shot breakthroughs and surpass required thresholds. Regional development banks and regional trade pacts can provide a source of funding; shortfalls can be made up by global institutions (e.g., the Global Fund is financing vaccines and other healthrelated knowledge searches for malaria and HIV/AIDS). Region-based research institutions are essential if region-specific needs are not to be ignored. Interregional cooperation can foster scale economies regarding similar research questions.",

In those cases, such as SARS or bird flu, where a worldwide epidemic may occur, actions to monitor and isolate a regional outbreak constitute GPGs. Obviously, rich nations and their institutions (e.g., CDC, NIH) are motivated to offer help to raise capacity to address such diseases. For those regional diseasescommunicable or otherwise-where rich nations are not in harm's way, there is less interest to augment a region's healthcare ability. Curing, monitoring, and/or ameliorating a region-specific disease is an RPG with little apparent spillover to the global community. In fact, Kremer and Leino (2004) view most public goods associated with communicable diseases as NPGs and RPGs. This viewpoint, however, misses some indirect links and subtleties. Nation-specific and regionspecific infections weaken a host population and make it more vulnerable to other communicable diseases that can travel to other venues. Plane travel facilitates rapid dissemination of acquired diseases. Similarly, an inadequate health infrastructure makes a population more susceptible to diseases that can spread worldwide. The ability to eradicate a disease through inoculation hinges on achieving sufficient immunity. Costly vaccinations must be administered worldwide until herd immunity is attained; hence, rich countries experience an externality unless a disease is completely eradicated. Inadequate healthcare responses in any region can have global spillovers.",

Many of these public goods are either of a weakest-link or bestshot variety. For weakest link RPGs, building capacity is the key because the least effort by a nation in the region determines the regionwide public good level achieved. Thus, an inadequate prophylactic by one nation permits the disease to spread and jeopardize the whole region. For poor regions, this enhanced capacity must come for bilateral donors, global institutions, or the regional development banks. If the region does not possess the proper infrastructure to use funds to provide the weakest-link RPG, then the aid must be in-kind with the donor supplying the good directly. At the regional level there is also a need for assistance to provide disease-related best-shot and better-shot public goods. The need is particularly acute for regionspecific communicable diseases that present little concern to rich countries. As with weakest-link RPGs, capacity is an issue that must be supplied by others working either alone or in partnerships. In recent years, foreign assistance to the health sector has increased. 5 Another concern is that developed and developing countries have different needs with respect to diseases. For HIV/AIDS, developed countries benefit from the development of more effective treatment regimes for those infected. Developing countries gain more from a vaccine that prevents the disease owing to the high rate of new infections and the limited funds for costly treatment regimes. Rich countries are more interested in noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease and cancer, than developing countries, and thus direct more of their research budget to ailments that pose less risk to the latter, whose population's life expectancy is shorter. Pharmaceutical companies heighten this asymmetry by developing drugs for lucrative markets with an emphasis on noncommunicable disease. This difference in orientation means that disease-related discoveries and treatments in rich countries have fewer spillovers to developing countries. Thus, best-shot health-related public goods are not going to come very frequently from rich countries. This emphasizes the need for assistance that account for the special health needs of the developing regions-e.g., funds for prevention of HIV/ AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.",

Nations have proper incentives to finance NPGs due to direct gains, while rich nations possess incentives to underwrite GPGs owing to spillover benefits. Neither individual nations nor the world community may have the right motives to fund RPGs. This is consistent with recent empirical work that shows bilateral donors, global institutions, and regional institutions strongly favor NPGs and GPGs over RPGs (Mascarenhas and Sandler, 2005; te Velde et al., 2002) . Thus, there is a growing need to focus foreign assistance on creating a more adequate supply of RPGs. To achieve this goal, regional development banks must be given greater financial capacity. These banks must, however, change some practices by supporting more RPGs and tailoring the loan-grant mix to the underlying publicness properties of the supported activity. In order to facilitate loans for RPGs, regional trade pacts and other regional institutions need to represent regional interests and provide collateral for loans.",

The aggregation technology is also an essential consideration.
