Deep understanding of these common aging features could be a major step toward development and application of specifi c pharmaceutical approaches, the aim of which would be to ameliorate, slow, and successfully manipulate the process of getting old. Of course, scientists in the fi eld are far from getting involved in the search for the elixir for eternal life, but do endeavor to spend lots of efforts in order to get a clearer picture of the most intimate mechanisms of aging. The task could be very hard because these well classifi ed hallmarks of aging seem interdependent making studies in the fi eld even more complicated. For example, DNA damage could lead to genomic instability but could be a consequence of it. Many factors, some extrinsic like UV irradiation, chemicals, and genotoxins, and others, intrinsic like ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, account for DNA damage and are one of the main culprits for the aging of the cells and the organism (Garinis et al. 2008 ) . The picture gets even more complicated since the metabolic stress that all cells undergo could be the primary cause for increased ROS production. Apparently following this line we enter in the vicious circle of trying to understand who is who and what is the cause and what the consequence of aging. No doubt, therefore, that the complexity of aging is considered as \"one of the major stumbling blocks of all biological investigations of aging\" (Martin 2005 ) .",

            "text": "Each of the 60 trillion cells that make up the human body (with some minor exceptions like the human erythrocytes) contains 2 m of genomic DNA in its nucleus. This is quite a huge amount of genetic material that has to be packed and organized in the confi ned space of the cell nucleus ( Fig. 2.1 ). The organization of DNA and, importantly, its proper functioning recently turned into one of the most interesting puzzles in biology. Two important issues have to be solved by the cells. The fi rst is about the way the genomic DNA is packaged to fi t the limited space in the cell nucleus which is only 10 \u03bcm in diameter, and the second question is about the way DNA works in this very compacted state. As a matter of fact almost all articles regarding chromatin , epigenetics , and DNA start with one and the same sentence, and it goes like that: \"DNA is not naked in the cells but is organized together with histone proteins in chromatin.\" Indeed chromatin is the platform where DNA meets histones-the last are considered to be at the heart of DNA compaction, its regulation, and dynamics (Hayes et al. 1990 ; Littau et al. 1965 ; Wolffe 1998 ) . Together with it they build the nucleosomes. Each nucleosome consists of two molecules of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), around which 147 bp of DNA are wrapped together. The nucleosome represents the basic repeat unit of chromatin (Richmond et al. 1984 ; Luger et al. 1997 ) . It is widely accepted that this is the fi rst level of chromatin compaction. By a physical point of view, the nucleosome represents an obstacle to all processes that require access to the molecule of DNA. Therefore, chromatin has to be modifi ed, reorganized, and de-compacted in order DNA to be transcribed, replicated, and repaired. This process of chromatin reorganization is done by specialized enzyme complexes, called chromatin modifying and chromatin remodeling complexes, which can chemically modify histones and can slide nucleosomes along the molecule of DNA. Nucleosomes are not only basic units of chromatin compaction but also exert important regulatory functions and manipulate the activity of the genome. They form nucleosome arrays, Fig. 2 .1 A drawing of chromatin compaction in the eukaryotic nucleus. DNA in the eukaryotic nucleus is organized together with histone proteins in chromatin. Nucleosomes are the main building blocks of chromatin which further compact together with linker histones in higher-order chromatin structures thus preserving the genome against stress but also maintaining its functionality which in relation to the electron microscopic images have poetically been called the \"beads-on-a-string\" structure (Thoma and Koller 1977 ; Rattner et al. 1982 ) . The diameter of this structure is approximately 11 nm and represents the second level of chromatin compaction. Regarding the size of the eukaryotic genome, it is obvious that this level of compaction is quite insuffi cient for stuffi ng DNA in the nucleus. It has been further shown that chromatin additionally compacts and forms 30 nm in diameter fi bers . Such folding of the nucleosome arrays into a compact fi lament with a diameter of about 30 nm in a salt-dependent manner was reported in numerous in vitro studies (Finch and Klug 1976 ; Thoma et al. 1979 ; Widom and Klug 1985 ; Huynh et al. 2005 ; . Evidence for the presence of the 30 nm chromatin fi ber in nuclei has also been provided from X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy analyses (Langmore and Schutt 1980 ; Andersson et al. 1982 ; Marsden and Laemmli 1979 ) . 30 nm \"fi berlike\" structures were detected when chromatin fragments were released from human cell nuclei and were also visualized by atomic force microscopy of reconstituted chromatin and of chromatin fragments from yeast nuclei (Georgieva et al. 2012 (Georgieva et al. , 2015 Prieto et al. 2012 ; Gilbert et al. 2004 ) .",

Recently, their existence in vivo has been questioned thus opening ardent discussions of how exactly chromatin is structured above the 11-nm chromatin fi laments (Fussner et al. 2012 ; Maeshima et al. 2014 ). The dispute probably has been induced by the different methodologies exploited for studying of this particular level of chromatin organization. It is true that some of the most meaningful results on this structure were obtained by in vitro experiments (Robinson et al. 2008 ; Routh et al. 2008 ) . Though, for more than four decades, lots of data were obtained by both in vivo and in vitro experiments favoring the existence of the 30 nm chromatin fi bers. Interestingly, the obtained results have proposed the existence of at least two different rod-like fi bers in the nuclei of eukaryotes: the fi rst with a diameter of 30 nm (the so-called \"one-start model\") and the second with a diameter of 24-26 nm (the \"two-start model\"), both, as noted by Grigoryev and coworkers ( 2009 ) able to appear consecutively in a single fi ber. Importantly, in a critical review by Ghirlando and Felsenfeld ( 2013 ) , it was stated that the 30 nm fi ber is not an indicator of the transcriptional status of chromatin but rather represents a structurally more compacted state of organization.",

In the cell nucleus, each chromosome occupies a limited volume, chromosome territory, and seems relatively static being physically anchored in this distinct and limited nuclear space (Figs. 2.1 and 2.2 ). However, the fi ndings from live microscopy and other experiments that enable tracking of chromatin dynamics in vivo have revealed large-scale chromatin motions and have proved the functional signifi cance of these motions for the cells and the organism (Gasser 2002 ; Chuang et al. 2006 ) . Three principle types of chromatin motion were recognized and were accepted as general. Interestingly, the three appeared quite different in time scale, range, and frequency of the movements as well as in energy dependence (Soutoglou and Misteli 2007 ) . Moreover, it has been shown that these Fig. 2. 2 A schematic representation of higher-order chromatin loop organization in three cellular conditions: a normal young cell, an aging cell, and a pathologically changed cell from a patient with Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS). Normally, interphase chromosomes are making numerous contacts with the nuclear lamina. Due to changes in chromatin organization and perturbations in lamina organization during the processes of cellular aging and in premature aging syndromes, many of these contacts between the chromosomes and the lamina are lost (shown with arrows in the fi gure). This leads to formation of longer chromatin loops, reorganization of chromosome territories, and loss of heterochromatin in the nucleus. In cells from the premature aging syndrome, HGPS, the nuclear lamina is severely dilapidated and therefore most of the chromosome contacts with it are disrupted. The diminished contacts between the lamina and the chromosomes in aged cells and in HGPS cells probably alter gene expression in a similar fashion and therefore aging and progeria syndromes represent similar clinical outcomes chromatin spatial rearrangements infl uence cellular fate and aging of the organisms (Chandra et al. 2015 ) .",

A remarkable exception of this conventional nuclear architecture is the inverted chromatin organization in photoreceptor cells of the nocturnal mammalian eye. Using FISH, some authors were able to characterize in detail the higher-order chromatin dynamics during terminal differentiation of rod cells of mouse retinas (Solovei et al. 2009 ) .

This dynamics assures both accurate expression of the genetic information as well as promises genomic stability. For example, in the time course of the cell cycle, from mitosis through interphase up to the next mitosis, chromatin undergoes global structural reorganization-from fully condensed mitotic chromosomes through less condensed, more diffused interphase chromatin conformation and then again to compacted chromosome entities. In order to meet the requirements of DNA-related processes, chromatin is not expected to be steadily and uniformly compacted across the genome in vivo , but to be dynamically modulated by local differences in chromatin components including numerous architectural and regulatory proteins as well as complex combinations (cross-talks) among diverse set of epigenetic modifi cations. No doubt that the regulation of chromatin dynamics comes through a variety of mechanisms including DNA methylation (Karymov et al. 2001 ; Ma et al. 2005 ) , posttranslational modifi cations (PTMs) of histones (Ito 2007 ; Gelato and Fischle 2008 ) , histone variants Clausell et al. 2009 ), recruitment of chromatin remodeling complexes (Corona et al. 2007 ; Clapier and Cairns 2009 ) , and noncoding RNAs (Li 2014 ; Dhanasekaran et al. 2013 ) . All these epigenetic regulators act in concert to exert the complex mechanisms that modulate chromatin conformation which in turn regulates gene expression in development , differentiation , aging, and disease. For example, these epigenetic marks as well as the level of chromatin condensation are distinct between normally proliferating, cancerous, and senescent cells (Oh et al. 2013 ; Rodriguez-Paredes and Esteller 2011 ) .",

            "text": "As we have already discussed, the nature of chromatin is very contradictory. At one hand, it is regarded as a static unit that guards the genome and protects the genetic material against DNA damage. On the other hand, chromatin appears quite dynamic. It \"breaths in\" and \"out\" with the surrounding environment and thus allows the cells to adapt by changing the expression of certain genes. In some cases, this dynamic property appears to counter the aging process and to extend organismal lifespan (Longo and Kennedy 2006 ; Gotta et al. 1997 ; Kennedy et al. 1997 ) . However, the stochastic component of chromatin structure might also contribute to the breakdown of nuclear, cellular, and tissue functions and consequently to lead to aging and ageassociated diseases (Lazarus et al. 2013 ; Sedivy et al. 2008 ) . Generally, aging involves major changes in chromatin structure and organization (Zane et al. 2014 ; Mu\u00f1oz-Najar and Sedivy 2011 ) . It has long been believed that during aging, nuclei show loss of heterochromatin (Ishimi et al. 1987 ) . Global changes in chromatin organization have been found to be associated with aging including the formation of senescence -associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) in euchromatic DNA and a gradual loss of perinuclear heterochromatin (Oberdoerffer and Sinclair 2007 ) . Deterioration of chromatin organization triggers in turn transcriptional alterations, accumulation of DNA damage, and increased genomic instability Feser and Tyler 2011 ; O'Sullivan and Karlseder 2012 ) .",

It has been speculated that these SAHF silence proliferation-promoting genes and thus lead to senescence-associated phenotypes (Corpet and Stucki 2014 ) . Remarkably, although SAHF appear to result from the condensation of almost entire chromosomes, DNA sequences that are typically contained in constitutive heterochromatin, such as pericentromeres and telomeres, actually appear to be excluded from the bulk of the condensed chromosomes (Zhang et al. 2009a ; Narita et al. 2003 ) . This was further proven by other authors who have shown that the shortened telomeres in mice lacking telomerase have reduced heterochromatin compared to telomeres from normal cells (Benetti et al. 2007a ). The molecular mechanism of SAHF formation remains poorly understood although histone chaperones Asf1a and HIRA have been reported to play a role in their formation (Zhang et al. 2005 ) . Other authors have even suggested that SAHF are a novel type of chromatin condensation involving alterations in the way by which DNA interacts with its binding proteins (Funayama et al. 2006 ) .",

It has been demonstrated that there is a consistent reduction in global DNA methylation during aging (Singhal et al. 1987 ; Wilson et al. 1987 ) while at certain places, namely the CpG islands of gene promoters, DNA methylation is increased with age (Kim et al. 2005 ) . In general, global DNA demethylation in aging occurs mainly at repetitive DNA elements and in genomic regions with facultative heterochromatin which leads to overall deheterochromatinization of the genome (Sedivy et al. 2008 ) . In contrast, hypermethylation of CGIs (CpG islands) is found mainly at promoters of stem cells' genes and also at promoters of tumor suppressor genes (Issa et al. 2001 ; Waki et al. 2003 ) . Both epigenetic phenomena explain two of the hallmarks of aging (L\u00f3pez-Ot\u00edn et al. 2013 ) : the observed exhaustion of stem cells during aging and the higher incidence of cancer with the advancement of age. The fi rst is due to increased methylation at the promoters of stem cells genes, especially those responsible for their pluripotency, while the second results from the aberrant hypermethylation of promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Interestingly, it has been observed that there is an increase in 5-methylcytosines within the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) clusters in livers of old rats, which could explain the decrease in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) levels that also occurs during aging (Oakes et al. 2003 ) . And though DNA methylation patterns at fi rst sight seem quite contradictory, there is logic for exploiting it as an aging marker.",

Therefore, it is normal to assume that aging-associated DNA methylation changes actively contribute to cancer susceptibility and growth (Fraga et al. 2007 ) . No doubt that both processes (aging and cancer) share almost the same DNA methylation marks. De novo DNA methylation Increase (Casillas et al. 2003 ; Lopatina et al. 2002 ) ND Increase (Hermann et al. 2004 ; Robertson et al. 1999 ) ND No data available summarizes the plethora of data concerning the role of DNA methylation in aging, cancer, and premature aging syndromes. What catches the attention immediately is the fact that most DNA patterns are shared among different cases. For example, global DNA hypomethylation of repeat-rich regions is observed in numerous cancers (Ehrlich 2009 ). DNA hypomethylation of repeat elements has been proposed to contribute to cellular transformation by promoting chromosomal rearrangements and elevating mutational rate. Apart from hypomethylation of repeat elements, loss of methylation from genic regions also causes aberrant gene expression and promotes tumorigenesis (Zane et al. 2014 ). In addition, promoters of genes that are targets of hypermethylation during aging overlap with DNA hypermethylated genes in many cancers (McGarvey et al. 2008 ) . For example, aberrant hypermethylation at promoters of CDKN2A , LOX , RUNX3 , and TIG1 , which act as tumor suppressor genes, has been detected during aging (Yanagawa et al. 2007 ; So et al. 2006a , b ) and was further accepted as a strong evidence that there is age-dependent onset of different types of cancer.",

            "text": "The epigenetic characteristics of young and old cells are not limited only to DNA methylation . Histones (core histones H2A, H2B, H3 H4, and the linker histones, H1) can undergo diverse and reversible posttranslational modifi cations that occur predominantly on their unstructured \"tail\" domains. Currently, more than ten different types of histone modifi cations are known to affect chromatin structure and function. The most prominent histone modifi cations include acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, ADP-ribosylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, and the list is ever growing (Bannister and Kouzarides 2011 ; Zhang et al. 2009a ). These covalent marks can be written and erased by site-specifi c enzymes such as histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs), histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and demethylases (KDM) (Cuthbert et al. 2004 ; Shi et al. 2004 ; Wang et al. 2004 ) , ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases, and many others specifi c for a particular modifi cation. The known histone modifi cations and some of their functional consequences are very well discussed in (Bannister and Kouzarides 2011 ) . The best known of these PTM's are shortlisted in Table 2 .2 , where their role in aging, cancer , and the premature aging syndromes are very well discussed. Posttranslational modifi cations not only alter the interaction of histone proteins with DNA but also infl uence inter-nucleosomal interactions and thus affect the overall chromatin structure. Moreover, these modifi cations could also recruit specifi c chromatin-associated proteins, like HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1), which recognizes and binds to H3K9me or the polycomb-group proteins (PcG), which recognize and bind to H3K27me or other complexes necessary for remodeling and maintenance of the global chromatin higher-order organization. These are also important for the establishment of distinct, probably specifi c, chromatin structures in defi ned genomic regions. Thus, local series of less compact, a more active open chromatin regions and a more condensed, closed chromatin patches were observed along the chromatin fi ber (Dekker 2008 ; Filion et al. 2010 ; Gilbert et al. 2004 ) . There are many studies showing the signifi cance of PTM's of histones for the aging process. Moreover, many of them have been accepted as markers of aging, cancer, and HGPS. ",

In yeast, aging can be studied using two main approaches: replicative lifespan (RLS) and chronological lifespan (CLS). RLS is defi ned as the number of buds produced before cell death. In practice, the replicative lifespan is measured by counting the number of divisions achieved by a cell whose buds are removed one by one by microdissection. Yeast replicative aging is comparable to aging phenomena observed in asymmetrically dividing cells of higher eukaryotes such as stem cells (Henderson and Hughes 2014 ; Lindstrom et al. 2011 ; Lindstrom and Gottschling 2009 ) . Alternatively, the yeast chronological aging is akin to the aging of nondividing cells such as neurons (Longo and Fabrizio 2012 ; Longo and Kennedy 2006 ) . CLS is defi ned as the time a cell survives in a nondividing state, with survival being measured as cell wall integrity or as ability to form a colony. Aging is then characterized based on the cells distribution in regard to their chronological lifespans, obtained by measuring survival with time in a stationary phase culture. Both models of yeast aging are accepted as golden models helping to understand aging in higher eukaryotes.",

This phenomenon could be well apprehended if the logic behind the molecular mechanisms is explained in detail. The anti-aging effect of Sir2 in yeast was, at least in part, due to the translocation of a Sir2-containing protein complex from telomeres to ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats. These repeats are prone to recombination and form extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs), which by complicated mechanisms shorten yeast lifespan. At the rDNA repeats, Sir2-mediated histone deacetylation, and consequent heterochromatinization by the Sir2-associated proteins (Sir3 and Sir4), prevents recombination and formation of ERCs, thereby extending lifespan (Kaeberlein et al. 2007 ; Kennedy et al. 1997 ) . Notably, orthologs of Sir2 have been shown to possess strong anti-aging functions in many other species, including nematodes, fl ies, and human (Herskovits and Guarente 2014 ; Guarente 2013 ) . In particular, transgenic overexpression of mammalian SIRT1 (the closest homolog to invertebrate Sir2) improves aspects of health during aging but does not increase longevity in mice (Herranz and Serrano 2010 ) . The mechanisms of the benefi cial effects of SIRT1 are complex and interconnected, including improved genomic stability that prevents the genome against fast aging.",

Histone acetylation and deacetylation seem quite important epigenetic modifi cations throughout the whole organismal lifespan . For example, increased global levels of H4K16ac were detected in old cells. Higher levels of H4K16ac have been demonstrated also at specifi c regions of the genome of old cells, for example, at the X core and X elements within the telomeric regions (Dang et al. 2009 ) . A correlation between the increased levels of H4K16ac with age and a decreased silencing of reporter genes inserted at these telomere proximal DNA elements was also reported in this chapter (Dang et al. 2009 ). It has been discussed that the increased levels of H4K16ac in old cells lead to a more open chromatin structure. The N-terminal tail of H4 is a crucial player in the formation of a fully compacted 30 nm chromatin fi ber (Dorigo et al. 2003 ; Robinson et al. 2008 ) . Therefore, it is not surprising that increased H4K16ac is accepted determinative for the more open state of chromatin and for the genome instability observed in aged cells. Interestingly, this specifi c epigenetic modifi cation has been linked to the linker histone H1, one of the factors responsible for genome stability (Downs and Cote 2005 ; Downs et al. 2003 ; Georgieva et al. 2012 ) . It was shown recently that loss of the tumour suppressor protein phosphatase PTEN leads to dissociation of histone H1 from chromatin, elevation of histone H4 acetylation at lysine 16, and decompaction of chromatin (Chen et al. 2014b ).",

They bind to DNA at its nucleosome entry/exit sites and are involved in the formation and maintenance of higher-order chromatin structure. Studies on H1 mobility in different cell types exposed to various treatments have suggested that modulation of H1-chromatin interactions are one of the earliest events leading to changes in the structure of the chromatin fi ber (Catez et al. 2006 ) . Represented by 11 subtypes in higher eukaryotes which are cell and tissue-specifi c, it is not surprising that linker histones have long been a challenge for scientists. Importantly, it is proven that these histones are essential for development . The reduction of H1 content with 50 % led to severe embryonic defects and fi nally to death in mice (Fan et al. 2005 ) . Moreover, recently it has been shown that the levels of H1, especially of H1c (one of the subtypes of H1 family), are crucial for the process of terminal differentiation of retina rod cells which requires global reorganization of chromatin and concentration of heterochromatin in the nuclear center (Popova et al. 2013 ) . As already has been discussed in the previous sections, the linker histone H1 is linked to aging. Its loss during senescence is associated with the formation of SAHF (Funayama et al. 2006 ) . As was mentioned, studies on linker histones in higher eukaryotes are impeded by the fact that higher eukaryotes have many subtypes of H1 and some of them are replaceable, i.e., they can be exchanged by other subtypes of linker histones. We have summarized the best known changes in linker and core histones together with other structural chromatin proteins in Table 2 .3 during aging, cancer , and HGPS. What is easily seen and very well expressed is the link among these changes in the three discussed states of the organism: the process of getting old, the process of malignization, and the detrimental premature aging features of HGPS. Knowing these changes is a prerequisite for all steps toward successful managing of them. For this, we need model organisms that could offer the most relevant platform for these studies.",

            "text": "During the past decade, scientists have started to see some of the principles of chromatin folding dynamics and their implication in different cellular processes. The fi rst discovery was that individual chromosomes occupy discrete domains in the interphase nucleus-named chromosome territories (Tark-Dame et al. 2011 ; Cremer and Cremer 2006 ) . This fi nding raised a lot of discussions in the fi eld of chromatin biology and induced further investigations which led to the observation that the mammalian interphase chromosomes are made up of a large number of structural loops, each of which is on average ~1 Mb, that correspond to DNA replication units (Ryba et al. 2010 ) . Generally, chromatin loops are accepted as an important aspect of chromatin organization. They represent the so-called higher-order chromatin structures and demonstrate high dynamics during aging and development . They bring together distant regulatory elements that control gene expression, such as promoters and enhancers (Kadauke and Blobel 2009 ) , and thus control cellular destiny. For instance, enhancers, insulators, and locus control regions can lie at distances from several kb up to one Mb or more away from the genes they regulate and may be located in cis (upstream or downstream) or in trans (on a different chromosome) (Woodcock 2006 ). Thus, chromatin looping is crucial for transcriptional regulation: activation and repression, coordination of initiation and termination, and boundary function. Loop formation is most likely to be a prerequisite for rather than a consequence of transcriptional activation as it occurs prior to gene activation (Palstra 2009 ). Furthermore, chromatin segments containing active genes loop out from their chromosome territories to reach out a transcription factory for their coordinated expression (Fraser 2006 ) . Figure 2. 2 brilliantly illustrates the dynamics in chromatin loop organization during normal development , aging, and some premature aging syndromes. The notion that chromatin loops are important for the overall genome organization is also supported by recent studies in yeast showing that the linker histone is important for the maintenance of bulk chromatin loop organization (Georgieva et al. 2012 ) .",

HGPS is a rare, sporadic genetic disease, which occurs in approximately 1 in 4 million live births (Pollex and Hegele 2004 ; Gordon et al. 2014 ). The average life expectancy of HGPS patients is 12-15 years. During this reduced lifespan they progressively accumulate features that resemble those of an aged individual like severe growth retardation, lipodystrophy, skeletal dysplasia, joint contractures, alopecia, skin and nail defects, progressive cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, and strokes (Merideth et al. 2008 ) .",

EZH2 ( enhancer of zeste homolog) methyltransferase is a subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) that has an essential role in the epigenetic maintenance of repressive chromatin states through trimethylation of H3K27 (Margueron et al. 2009 ). In contrast, in fi broblast cells from a female HGPS patient, the H3K27me3 mark is lost on the inactive X chromosome with a concomitant downregulation of EZH2 which leads to some decondensation of this chromosome (Shumaker et al. 2006 ) . Importantly, the alterations in chromatin regulation precede the nuclear shape changes (Shumaker et al. 2006 ) pointing out the pivotal role of chromatin in pathological premature aging.",

            "text": "Furthermore, genome-wide analysis of H3K27me3 distribution revealed patches of decreased H3K27me3 in HGPS nuclei. In particular, gene-poor regions of HGPS fi broblasts experience a reduction of H3K27me3 compared with the control (McCord et al. 2013 ) . As in previous reports, loss of H3K27me3 in HGPS was associated with downregulation of EZH2 since the mRNA level of EZH2 was significantly reduced in four HGPS fi broblast cell lines compared to normal control samples (McCord et al. 2013 ; Shumaker et al. 2006 ; Margueron et al. 2009 ). Genome-wide analyses revealed a correlation between alterations in patterns of H3K27me3 deposition, genome organization, and DNA-lamin A/C interactions in HGPS skin fi broblasts (McCord et al. 2013 ). Based on this, authors proposed a model in which accumulation of progerin in the nuclear lamina leads to reduction in the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in heterochromatin (most possibly through the downregulation of EZH2) and disrupts interactions between heterochromatin and nuclear lamina. These changes may then result in transcriptional misregulation and global loss of spatial chromatin compartmentalization (McCord et al. 2013 ). In addition, downregulation of the constitutive heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 and loss of pericentric heterochromatin were detected in HGPS cells (Scaffi di and Misteli 2006 ; Shumaker et al. 2006 ; ). The loss of heterochromatinization of pericentric regions induces transcription of pericentromeric satellite III repeats (Shumaker et al. 2006 ) .",

Several lines of evidence argue that the disruption of heterochromatin structure in progeria syndrome can be attributed to deregulation of the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylation (NuRD) complex ). NuRD is a ubiquitous ATP -ase-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that has been shown to associate with pericentromeric heterochromatin and to maintain transcriptional repression at specifi c promoters (Bowen et al. 2004 ; Helbling Chadwick et al. 2009 ). NuRD is a multicomponent complex, containing the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, histone-binding proteins RBBP4 and RBBP7, metastasis-associated protein MTA3, the ATPases CHD3 and CHD4 (chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein) as subunits (Zhang et al. 1999 ) . Besides NuRD, histone chaperone proteins RBBP4 and RBBP7 are shared components of Polycomb PRC2 complex involved in the establishment of heterochromatin (Kuzmichev et al. 2002 ) , and RBBP4 is also a subunit of the CAF-1 complex, which assembles chromatin upon DNA replication and DNA damage repair (Verreault et al. 1996 ) . RBBP4/7 interact with the amino acid residues 562-664 fragment of lamin A in vivo and neither protein binds to progerin, which lacks residues 607-657 of mature lamin A ) demonstrating that RBBP4/7 mediate physical tethering of NuRD to nuclear lamina. Therefore, the accumulation of progerin in HGPS cells abolishes this interaction that consequently affects the proper chromatin remodeling which in turn triggers deregulation of cellular functions. Further, protein levels of several NuRD components including MTA3, RBBP4, and RBBP7 as well as the HDAC1 amount and activity are reduced in HGPS cells and normal cells expressing exogenous progerin ). The observation that shRNAmediated silencing of HDAC1, MTA3, CHD3, or CHD4 in normal cells was sufficient to recapitulate age-dependent chromatin defects, e.g., loss of H3K9me3 and HP1\u03b3 heterochromatin foci, heterochromatin deregulation, and increased DNA damage, indicates the importance of NuRD in aging-associated chromatin defects ). Moreover, the loss of RBBP4, RBBP7, and HDAC1 subunits of NuRD is not limited to premature aging, but reduced levels of these proteins are also a feature of normally aged cells ).",

Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation , chromatin remodeling and miRNAs, which may induce alterations in gene expression, are thought to be involved in Alzheimer's disease. The most characteristic feature of AD is cognitive impairment that together with neuropathological changes, extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofi brillary tangles and loss of synapses and neurons are similar in the early-onset and lateonset forms of the disease. Both forms the early-and late-onset of AD have genetic components. Mutations in three genes identifi ed in the early-onset familial form, i.e., amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1, and presenilin-2, established the central role of amyloid in the disease. However, it should be noted that mutations in these genes are present in only 13 % of patients with the early-onset form of the disease. The technological advances, such as large-scale genome-wide association studies, have led to identifi cation of more than ten risk genes for the late-onset form of AD (Bettens et al. 2013 ) . Early onset familial AD accounts for less than 1 % of all AD cases (Lambert and Amouyel 2007 ) . Early-onset Alzheimer's appears to be linked to a genetic defect on chromosome 14, to which late-onset Alzheimer's is not linked (Campion et al. 1999 ) . The genes implicated in these forms of the disease are the gene encoding for APP, located on chromosome 21q21, the gene encoding for presenilin 1 (PSEN1), located on chromosome 14q24.3, and that encoding for presenilin 2 (PSEN2), on chromosome 1q31-q42 (Ertekin-Taner 2007 ) . APP mutations account for less than 0.1 % of AD patients. Mutations in APP are located near the cleavage sites of the protein resulting in increased production of the Amyloid beta peptide (A\u03b2). The average age of disease onset for this mutation is between 40s and 50s. The majority of AD cases have complex etiology due to both environmental and genetic factors, which alone do not seem suffi cient for causing the disease. Several works are demonstrating direct epigenetic modulation of the disease.",

H1 preferentially binds A\u03b2-42, as well as A\u03b2-like structures of numerous proteins (Duce et al. 2006 ).

Why aging should be a risk factor for AD (and other age-related disorders), however, is not well understood, particularly at a mechanistic level. Progressive age-related decline in total methylcytosine has been reported in various organisms. It has been speculated that progressive, age-related, genome-wide hypomethylation may be due to parallel DNMT1 defi cits. Age-dependent increase in S -adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) relative to SAM might also play a role (Mastroeni et al. 2011 ) . Age-dependent hypomethylation of a number of specifi c genes related to AD has been reported. For example, methylation of cytosines in the APP promoter, particularly GC-rich elements from approximately \u2212270 to \u2212182 bp, is signifi cantly lower in autopsy cases of 70 years old individuals compared to cases with much younger individuals (Mastroeni et al. 2011 ) . These age-related modifi cations on DNA methylation alter APP expression and consequently can affect the progressive A\u03b2 deposition with aging in the brain (Tohgi et al. 1999 ).",

            "text": "Another gene that is considered to be a factor for both sporadic and familial forms of the disease is LRRK2. The LRRK2 gene encodes for the large-280 kDa leucinerich repeat kinase multifunctional protein also called dardarin. The most observed mutations in both sporadic and dominant variants of PD are the increase of catalytic activity of dardarin which causes neuronal toxicity and dopaminergic neuron degeneration (Abdullah et al. 2014 ) . Some authors postulate that change in gene transcription exerts a modulating effect on the central nervous system (CNS) and pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Epigenetic linkage in neurodegenerative diseases is yet inconclusive and more data are needed; however, there is evidence showing the role of DNA methylation in PD and the role of chromatin remodeling in the persisting effects of dopamine on brain function. Strong evidence indicates that DNA methylation in PD is based on the deregulation of homocysteine (Hcy). Generally, the levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are variable among individuals. This is the result of genetic or environmental factors that infl uence the levels of dietary folate thus having a major impact on homocysteine (Hcy) levels (Giles et al. 1995 ) . In the metabolism of methylation reactions, folate is converted into l -methylfolate ( l -MTHF) by the enzyme dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase in order to be absorbed by the intestine. The next step is the association of l -MTHF with Hcy and methionine synthetase producing methionine. Methionine is converted to S -adenosylmethionine (SAM) and through the joint action of methyltransferases the product S -adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is formed from which subsequently Hcy is generated. The generated Hcy reenters the methylation cycle and serves for generating methyl groups required for methylation reactions on DNA CpG islands or onto the lysine and arginine residues of histone proteins. Increased concentrations of plasma total Hcy have been reported in patients with PD; this effects the SAM/SAH ratio by increasing SAH and decreasing SAM, leading to an overall decrease in methylation potential (Blandini et al. 2001 ) . Better cognitive functions were associated with increased SAM/SAH ratio in patients with PD. This suggests a possible role of methylation in neurodegenerative disorders like PD (Obeid et al. 2009 ). There are several studies that submit evidence proving the central role of histone modifi cation in neurotoxicity and thus the role of epigenetics in it.",

The differences in susceptibility may be related to a number of factors among which the age can have an overall effect on disease resistance, with the very young and the very old being more susceptible to infection by a wide variety of pathogens. Stress in the form of extreme exertion, shock, a change in environment , climate change, nervousness, or muscle fatigue can have a negative impact on health. Each of these conditions is thought to increase the release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex, causing a suppression of the infl ammatory response, thereby facilitating infection.

In some cases, viruses may use novel or viral-specifi c epigenetic modifying activities, which may refl ect variant pathways that distinguish their behavior from the bulk of the cellular chromosome. The role of chromatin in virus biology depends largely on the lifestyle of the virus, but for all viruses that transverse the nucleus, interactions with chromatin are unavoidable. A number of recent discoveries in virology underscore the importance of chromatin dynamics in the regulation of essential viral processes, including entry, gene expression, and replication (Lieberman 2006 ) . Cellular chromatin forms a dynamic structure that maintains the stability and accessibility of the host DNA genome. Viruses that enter and persist in the nucleus must, therefore, contend with the forces that drive chromatin formation and regulate chromatin structure (Lieberman 2006 ; Robertson 2005 ) . The complex and dynamic properties of nuclear chromatin present a formidable challenge to viral gene expression and genome propagation. Recently, a wealth of information has been uncovered regarding the structure, function, and regulation of chromatin during complex cellular processes such as differentiation , recombination, aging, and carcinogenesis. Recent studies have also revealed that chromatin has a major role in the life cycle of many viruses, and that viruses have coevolved with numerous strategies for modulating chromatin-related processes (Lieberman 2006 ) . The genomes of many DNA viruses persist for considerable lengths of time in the host-cell nucleus. The small DNA tumor viruses such as simian virus 40 (SV40) and polyoma virus are assembled into nucleosomal minichromosomes during the DNA replication process. Because these viruses use cellular replication enzymes, it is thought that the viral minichromosomes are assembled through a mechanism that is indistinguishable from nucleosome assembly on replicating cellular chromosomes (Lieberman 2006 ) .",

HIV, for example, was found to integrate at chromatin sites enriched in euchromatic histone modifi cations, including H3 K4 methylation and histone H3 and H4 acetylation (Wang et al. 2007 ). LEDGF appears to be a decisive and essential factor in mediating the chromatin attachment of the PIC and viral integration (Llano et al. 2006 ) .",

Apoptosis is an energydependent process that can be triggered from the activation of calcium-dependent endonucleases whose function is to cleave genomic DNA. The phenomenon of apoptosis seems to play an important role in the control of virus infection since several viruses have developed ways to counteract the apoptosis. Herpes virus, Epstein-Barr virus, adenoviruses, and African swine fever virus have all been reported to code a protein that functions as an inhibitor of apoptosis (Ackermann et al. 2000 ) .",

This susceptibility is due to many factors but also due to decline in the immune response. The immune system is the adaptive defense system in vertebrates, which evolved to protect them from invading pathogenic microorganisms, viruses, and cancer . It has the ability to generate a variety of immuno-competent cells and molecules that specifi cally recognize and eliminate pathogens. Older organisms may succumb to viral infection due to exaggerated immune response as it is proven that in old mouse models there is an elevated immune response as aged mice produce higher serum levels of infl ammatory mediator IL-17 than their younger counterparts upon herpes virus infection. Major contributor for the elevated IL-17 are the NKT cells in the aged mice. Aging induces increase in RORyT transcription factor within NKT cell promoter of IL-17. During herpes virus infection, these aged cells produce exaggerated levels of IL-17 leading to worse outcomes in aged host. This challenges the more accepted notion that reduced immunity with aging is the dominant reason for the aged hosts to be more susceptible to viral infections. In unison is the notion that aged, but not young, mice succumb to systemic herpes viral infection due to exaggerated infl ammation (Goldstein 2010 ) .",

There are data showing that the advanced age affects dendritic cells' (DC) functions. It has also been shown that the monocyte-derived DC cells from the aged organism are impaired in their capacity to secrete IFN-1 and INF-3, both playing a role in organismal defense against viral respiratory infections. Some authors advocate that the reduction of IFN-1 and IFN-3 is a result of age-associated modifi cations in the chromatin structure, namely the increase in H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 at the promoters of IFN-1 and IFN-3 (Prakash et al. 2013 ). This was accompanied by decreased association of these promoters with activator histone marks like H3K4me3 in aged DCs after activation with infl uenza, thus highlighting the signifi cance of chromatin organization for the age-dependent susceptibility of organisms to viral infections.",
