The lung cancer population requiring active treatment has been classified as 'extremely vulnerable', with a significant proportion of previously treated lung cancer patients included in this category due to coexisting severe comorbidities [1, 2] . There is, therefore, a need to mitigate the risks of their anti-cancer treatments by addressing risks associated with multiple visits to hospital, treatment-induced immune suppression and radiation-associated lung injury. This means adapting our current treatment protocols rapidly to reflect the shifting risk-benefit ratio and diminished resources. Furthermore, the impact of this pandemic will probably last for a significant length of time beyond the resumption of normal services. This is due to the anticipated backlog of patients diagnosed with lung cancer and the increased demands on the radiotherapy departments due to the deferral of radiotherapy for disease sites such as breast and prostate.",

Sixty patients had been enrolled (88% stage III). Chemotherapy was given to some patients sequentially (before or after radiotherapy) but not concurrently. Less toxicity was reported in the 15-fraction arm. Cho et al. [21] retrospectively reviewed hypofractionated radiotherapy for medically inoperable T1-T3 N0 NSCLC using a risk-adaptive dose schedule (60 Gy in four, 15 or 20 fractions depending on location, size and geometry of the tumour in relation to the oesophagus). In total, 124 patients were included in the study: 72.6% had T1-2 N0 tumours; 65.3% had centrally located disease; 44.1% had performance status 2-3; and 20.2% received 60 Gy/15 fractions. In patients treated with 15 fractions, the rate of grade 3 pneumonitis was 4% with no grade 4-5 pneumonitis and no grade 2-5 oesophagitis reported.",
