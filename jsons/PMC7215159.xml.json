            "text": "As of April 28, 2020, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has accounted for the death of around 217,000 people worldwide. Upcoming reports have suggested that patients with COVID-19 infection have a high burden of complications [1], and underlying comorbidities like cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, and hypertension, and cancer [2]. A recent meta-analysis of studies published in China reported a pooled diabetes prevalence of 10.3% among patients infected with Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3]. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients with adverse outcomes have a diabetes rate ratio of 2.26 (95% CI 1.47\u20133.49) compared to those with a favorable outcome [3]. Age has been suggested to be one of the important drivers of COVID-19 related mortality with a rate of 7.8% among elderly (>80 years) versus 0.0016% in children (aged \u2264 9 years) [4]. These figures suggest that the presence of diabetes in the elderly COVID-19 population could add-up to the worse outcomes. However, data on age-specific diabetes prevalence in COVID-19 patients remains unknown. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the pooled estimate of diabetes prevalence in young (<50 years) versus elderly (>50 years) COVID-19 cohorts.",

Consistently, a report from the United States also revealed that among 457 intensive care unit admissions, a majority (78%) of them occurred in older patients or patients with pre-existing comorbidities [5]. Previous studies on SARS-CoV reported that the presence of cardiac disease and diabetes could increase the risk of death by two folds as much as other risk factors [6]. Elderly patients with a high burden of diabetes may also have other underlying cardiovascular conditions. A study by Shi et al. suggested that COVID-19 patients with the underlying cardiovascular disease might also be susceptible to acute cardiac injury that could potentially increase the risk of in-hospital mortality [7]. Furthermore, older age is a major risk factor for the occurrence of arrhythmias, which could have an additive worse effect with the presence of diabetes, a chronic inflammatory state.",

Elderly with diabetes often have concomitant hypertension which could require Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). These medications have a debatable role in increasing the susceptibility for COVID-19 infection and related outcomes. ACE2 has been identified as one of the major receptors for SARS-Cov-2, which is also widely expressed in the pancreas [9]. Similarly, Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is reported as a primary receptor in MERS-CoV, however, its role in SARS-CoV-2 has not yet established [9]. With such limited knowledge, it is imperative to identify whether patients with diabetes who are on ARBs/ACEIs or any other anti-diabetic drugs exacerbate COVID-19 prognosis.",

Several trials have shown that hydroxychloroquine decreased HbA1c level in decompensated diabetes patients [10], although, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Given the indirect effect of hydroxychloroquine in diabetes, and the possible role of ACE2 and DPP-4 in SARS-CoV2, caution is warranted when treating COVID-19 patients with diabetes. It is also conceivable that acute decompensated diabetes would severely hinder COVID-19 care and prognosis, especially among the geriatric population.",
