            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect a variety of mammalian species including bats, mice, cats, birds and humans causing infection of respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and the central nervous system [1]. CoVs are enveloped viruses containing the largest known single-stranded RNA genomes (25\u201332 kb) with positive-sense orientation. They are divided into four genera: Alpha- (HCoV-229E), Beta- (SARS-CoV: lineage B; MERS-CoV: lineage C), Gamma- and Deltacoronavirus [2]. The six human CoVs, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV mainly target the respiratory tract. 15\u201330% of common colds are caused by HCoVs (229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1) with mostly seasonal occurrence. Whereas 229E and OC43 are known since the mid-1960s, SARS-CoV appeared first in China causing a worldwide outbreak with 8098 cases and 774 deaths in 2002/03 and with enormous socio-economic impact [3]. Arising interest in CoVs led to the discovery of NL63 in 2004 [4] and HKU1 in 2005 [5]. MERS was identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. By 31 May 2015 MERS-CoV infections rose to 1154 cases with 431 deaths [6]. In May 2015 a new outbreak occurred in South Korea with over 120 reported cases, 10 deaths as of 11 June [7], and over 2300 individuals placed under quarantine, making it the largest outbreak outside Saudi Arabia.",

Development of antivirals has concentrated on the development of protease [8, 9] and helicase inhibitors [10, 11]. Great efforts have been made to discover anti-MERS agents by screening defined drug libraries [12, 13, 14]. Although, CoVs display some proofreading activities during replication viral targets are usually prone to develop resistance mutations rather quickly. Therefore, defining cellular co-factors required for viral replication as targets is rather intriguing. Screening 16,671 diverse compounds for anti-229E activity Lundin et al. have identified an inhibitor (K22) specifically targeting membrane-bound coronaviral RNA synthesis at an early step of viral replication [15]. Using unbiased high-throughput protein\u2013protein interaction screening methods we identified cyclophilins as binding factors for CoV proteins and its inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) as broad-range anti-coronaviral agent [16\u2022\u2022]. CsA binding and inactivation of CypA as cellular co-factor for virus propagation is summarized in the accompanying article in the October issue of Current Opinion in Virology by von Hahn and Ciesek [17]. Here we summarize the inhibitory effect of CsA and non-immunosuppressive derivatives thereof on CypA function during CoV replication. We further describe the effect of the genetic deficiency and of individual CypA SNP mutants on the replication of HCoV-229E indicating the requirement of correctly folded enzymatic groove of CypA.",

            "text": "Cyclophilins and FKBPs are members of two ubiquitously distributed PPIase families, collectively called immunophilins [18\u2022\u2022]. They are important for a number of cellular processes, for example, protein folding, maturation, trafficking, signal transduction, cell differentiation, apoptosis and infections. CypA and CypB were recognized in 1993 by Y2H techniques to specifically bind to the HIV-1 Gag polyproteins Pr55gag and to capsid p24, but only CypA was demonstrated to be specifically incorporated into HIV-1 virions [reviewed by 19\u2022\u2022]. Binding of the amino-terminal domain of HIV-1 capsid to the active groove of CypA was demonstrated by crystal structure [20] and by mutational analysis [21, 22]. Proline-containing peptide substrates bind to this hydrophobic pocket conferring them enzymatic peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIases, EC number 5.2.1.8) activity. The isomerase function of Cyp was identified already in 1989 [23\u2022]. It was first shown for HIV-1 that CsA also binds to the groove thus interfering with proper capsid formation and virus replication. In the case of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) the involvement of Cyps was shown by several groups. Initially conflicting results on which CypA or B was supporting HCV replication could be clarified in favor of CypA [24, 25, 26].",

            "text": "A very important, but from PPIase activity completely independent feature of CsA binding to CypA is the formation of a tri-molecular complex with the cellular phosphatase Calcineurin (Cn). This is a natural coincidence with far-reaching consequences on the immune system: Cn normally dephosphorylates the important immunologic transcription factor NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells), which can then translocate to the nucleus and act as a key regulator of T-cell development and Interleukin-2 production [27\u2022]. CypA/CsA/Cn complexes prevent NFAT dephosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus thus leading to the suppression of the immune system. CsA as a 11mer cyclic peptide displays a \u2018surface\u2019 for binding to the PPIase groove of CypA [28] and one for complexing with Cn (Figure 1\n). Intensive efforts were made to separate the PPIase blocking from the immunosuppressive functions of CsA. Modifying side chains of the CsA molecule allowed the development of non-immunosuppressive analogs NIM811 [29, 30], Alisporivir [ALV, Debio-025] [31], SCY-635 [32], sangliferins [33] and a series of newly synthesized CsA position 1-modified compounds [34, 35, 36]. Alisporivir has experienced substantial clinical testing and safety database development with more than 2000 patients treated for up to 48 weeks. NIM811 and SCY-635 have been administered in a very small number (<50 patients) only in short proof-of-concept trials.",

            "text": "A first hint on the possible involvement of a cyclophilin, namely CypA, in SARS-CoV replication came from an educated guess finding, which demonstrated interaction of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein with CypA by surface plasmon resonance biosensor technology paralleling the binding of HIV-1 gag to CypA [37]. This finding was supported by a proteomics study which identified CypA as one of a number of cellular proteins incorporated into purified SARS-CoV particles by spectrometric profiling [38]. Inhibitory effects of CsA on CoV replication was reported by several laboratories: (1) using unbiased high throughput Y2H protein\u2013protein interaction screening methods we have noticed the binding of several cyclophilins to SARS-CoV nsp1, and CsA as pan-CoV inhibitor including SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E/-NL63, Feline CoV (FCoV) serotypes I and II [strains Black and 791146], Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV PUR46) and Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV Beaudette) [16\u2022\u2022]. In a follow-up study it could be demonstrated that, at least for replication of HCoV-NL63 CypA, not CypB is the cyclophilin required for virus replication [36]. As also the immunophilins FKBP1A and FKBP1B showed up as nsp1 interaction partners in the Y2H virus\u2013host protein interaction screens mentioned above, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E-GFP/-LUC were tested for sensitivity to FK506. The drug could effectively inhibit replication of these viruses, and HCoV-NL63 did not replicate in FKBP1A/B knockdown CaCo2 cell lines [39]. Thus, PPIase activities of CypA and FKBPs seem to be required for CoV replication but they do not substitute for each other. The current interpretation is that the two classes of PPIases act on different viral proteins. (2) Replication inhibition by CsA up to 4 logs was also shown for GFP-expressing SARS-CoV, 229E and MHV [Mouse Hepatitis Virus] [40] as well as for MERS-CoV [41]. In these studies a specific cyclophilin could not be attributed to SARS-CoV replication. (3) Replication of the highly pathogenic cat CoV Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV) was shown to be sensitive to CsA, but not to FK506 [42]. Rather interestingly, when performing the CsA inhibition experiments with animal CoVs [16\u2022\u2022] we also did not find FK506 inhibition of the two FCoV serotypes (Black/791146; unpublished and Heinz-J\u00fcrgen Thiel, personal communication), and of TGEV PUR46 and IBV Beaudette strains (unpublished; Christel Schwegmann-We\u00dfels/Georg Herrler, personal communication). (4) Cyclophilin D was shown to play a central role in HCoV-OC43-induced neuronal programmed cell death by CypD knockdown and CsA inhibition. Here, CsA in combination with CypD acted as an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeabilization transition pore [43].",

As discussed by these authors the first three functional (with respect to suppression of virus replication) amino acid exchanges are located near the isomerase active site whereas the non-functional second mutation set is located remote (see Figure 1). Destabilization of CypA was identified as the underlying mechanism, resulting in near-complete intracellular CypA depletion. Before infection of the mutant cell lines with HCoV-229E, CypA mRNA levels detected by qPCR analysis were tested and found to be (with the exception of mutant E84D) quite comparable.

Reasons could be either that, as opposed to a knockout the knockdown of CypA is not complete and the activity of the residual molecules suffices for cell growth, or the PPIase functions could be overtaken by other isomerases as was already shown for prolyl isomerases of the Pin1 type [54, 55]. In any case, CypA is a prolyl isomerase required for propagation of HCV and CoVs. From both, the HCV and the HCoV studies it is clear that expression of correctly folded, stable CypA is essential and that blockade of the active groove by CsA or its derivatives blocks enzymatic functions essential for replication of both viruses. For coronaviruses it has to be clarified whether other viral proteins, apart from the CypA binders nsp1 and nucleocapsid, require the proline-directed binding and PPIase activity of CypA and what the underlying mechanism for their involvement in virus replication is.",

Huh-7.5 cells and subclones were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (both Gibco LifeTechnologies), l-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells harboring small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs were kept in the presence of blasticidin (5 \u03bcg/mL). G418 (750 \u03bcg/mL) was additionally added to cells carrying pWPI-encoded CypA variants [46]. hTOP1 was used in qPCR to standardize cyclophilin expression. (b) Replication was measured by determining Renilla Luciferase activity in cell extracts after 24 and 48 h p.I. Values are given as relative light units (RLU).
