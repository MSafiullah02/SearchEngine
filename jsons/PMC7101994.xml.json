Patients with persistent HBV infection are at a high risk of developing chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The natural history of persistent HBV infection has four dynamic phases, immune tolerance phase with positive HBeAg and very high viral load, immune clearance phase with seroconversion of HBeAg to anti-HBe and reduced viral load, low replication phase with positive anti-HBe and low viral load, and reactivation phase with negative HBeAg and high viral load [1]. In the review by Lin and Kao [2], evidence showing that high viral load, genotype C, basal core promoter mutation and pre-S deletion are associated with liver disease progression and HCC development in patients with persistent HBV infection is discussed.",

From the study of a murine model of a transplantable T-cell lymphoma of spontaneous origin designated as Dalton\u2019s lymphoma (DL), it had been reported that DL growth is associated with thymus regulation, modulation of macrophage activation, humoral and T cell-mediated immune responses [4]. Gupta and Sing [5] in this issue studied if a gender-dependent differential induction of tumor cell apoptosis is responsible for the manifestation of gender dimorphism in DL growth. They found that male hormone androgen and female estrogen could differentially modulate tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis through alteration in the expression of cell death regulating genes: p53 and CAD. DL cells obtained from male mice showed a higher expression of proapoptotic proteins: CAD and p53. Furthermore, these gonal hormones also induced tumor cells to produce tumor growth regulating proteins including VEGF, FGF-\u03b2, INF-\u03b3 and IL-2. Androgen-treated DL cells expressed more INF-\u03b3, whereas estrogen-treated cells elaborated more TGF-\u03b2 and IL-2. These results demonstrated that the progressive growth of a T cell lymphoma displays gender dimorphism in a differential rate of tumor cell growth and in the expression of proteins regulating tumor growth and cell death.",

            "text": "Mutations in the p53 gene are frequently observed in human tumors, and inheritance of mutated p53 gene predisposes patients to genomic instability and subsequent tumor development [6]. Previous study suggested that DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) level is elevated in p53-null cells, whereas its expression is low in wild-type p53 cells but is increased dramatically in response to p53-dependent DNA damage signaling [7]. Guo et al. [8] therefore compared the expression levels of DNMT and p16ink4A in TK6 cells expressing wild type p53 and WTK1 cells expressing a mutant form of p53. Lower level of p16ink4A protein was detected in WTK1 cells than in TK6 cells, which was accompanied by DNMT1 gene expression as well as hypermethylation of the p16ink4A promoter. Furthermore, loss of suppression function of mutant p53 to DNMT1 in WTK1 was caused by the attenuation of its binding ability to the DNMT1 promoter. These results indicate that the mutant p53 loses its ability to suppress DNMT1 expression, and thus enhances methylation level of the p16ink4A promoter and subsequently down-regulates p16ink4A protein.",

CaBP1 was found to have two alternatively spliced variants, L- and S-CaBP1 [10]. It has been shown to modulate the activity of various calcium channels through its binding to the C-terminal CaM-binding domain or to the IQ domain [11]. In this communication, Chen et al. [12] reports that CaBP1 inhibits stimulation-induced calcium current in cultured neurons, suggesting that CaBP1 plays an important role in modulating the stimulation-coupled activation of calcium channels. These findings are significant and may shed light on the function of CaBP1 in modulating Ca2+ currents and neurotransmitter release in excitable cells.",

It consists of two units, an A chain and a B chain, linked by a disulfide bond, and the disulfide bridge between the A and B chains is necessary for maintaining the cytotoxicity of the lectin [17]. Kang et al. [18] studied the effect of Korean mistletoe lectin (KML-IIU) on nitric oxide (NO) production in murine macrophage cells in order to delineate its immunomodulatory effect. Treatment of cells with subchains of the KML-IIU, which have lower toxicity, enhanced NO production by cells in the presence of a suboptimal concentration of INF-\u03b3 through the induction of iNOS gene expression. These results demonstrated that the subchains of KML-IIU induce NO production in murine macrophages via activation of iNOS expression, suggesting that the KML-IIU subunits may be used as an immunomodulator to enhance the effector functions of innate immune cells.",

Although the combination therapy is effective for hepatitis C, ribavirin can induce hemolytic anemia that may necessitate dose reduction or even discontinuation of the therapy [20]. Selective delivery of ribavirin to hepatocytes would be desirable to enhance its antiviral activity and meanwhile decrease the systemic side effects. In this issue, Jukic et al.

Results demonstrated that elevation of calcium concentration in conscious rats caused systemic hypotension and bradycardia accompanying sympathetic inhibition and parasympathetic activation. It also increased the plasma nitrate/nitrite, hydroxyl radical, proinflammatory cytokines, and procalcitonin levels as well as the iNOS activity in lung tissue. Severe pulmonary edema occurred.

            "text": "This study [31] reported that a novel synthetic oleanolic acid derivative with nitrate, CPU-112, alleviated CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in mice with a decrease in hepatic hydroxyproline content and histological changes. CPU also attenuated the mRNA expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase type 1 (TIMP-1). However, CPU-112 did not affect the survival of HSC-T6 cells but decreased the expression of procollagen-\u03b11 through drown-regulation of the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK.",

            "text": "The incidence of human urothelial carcinoma (UC) is three times higher in males than in females [32]. Several studies have implicated the involvement of androgen in spontaneous and chemical-induced bladder tumor development in rats [33]. However, the role of androgen and androgen receptor (AR) in the development of human UC has been less well studied. The length polymorphism of the CAG triplet repeat coding for a polyglutamine (PolyGln) of AR has been shown to associate with endocrine or neurological disorders [34]. Liu et al. [35] examined the association of smoking and the length polymorphism of CAG and GGN repeat of AR in UC cases and age and sex-matched controls. They found that among the medium-dose cigarette smokers, those who had 23 CAG and shorter GGN (<22) repeats had a higher risk than those with longer CAG and GGN. This observation opens up a new direction to study interaction of genetic factor and smoking in the development of human UC.",
