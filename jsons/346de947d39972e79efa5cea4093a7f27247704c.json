On the same day, the disease 8 was deemed to be a pandemic by the World Health 9 Organization, with a warning that health care planning 10 efforts will be needed to face the upcoming spread of 11 COVID-19 worldwide.12 From the experience in Wuhan, China, for 138 hospital-13 ized patients with COVID-19, the most common symptoms 14 at onset of illness are fever (98.6%), fatigue (69.6%), dry 15 cough (59.4%), myalgia (34.8%), and dyspnea (31.2%) [1]. 16 Knowledge of the symptoms and their prevalence is of 17 paramount importance for all physicians, including those 18 from diverse backgrounds such as surgeons, who are called 19 to face COVID-19 disease in their daily practice as well. 20 As far as the urology field is concerned, no certain direct 21 impact of COVID-19 on urogenital tissues has been reported 22 to date [1-4]. However, urologists can be involved in the 23 initial evaluation of patients presenting with fever without 24 other symptoms of COVID-19, often interpreted as urosep-25 sis. The attribution of fever to urinary infection could be 26 supported by the possible presence of urological devices 27 previously positioned to relieve urinary obstruction. 28 Ureteral stenting and the positioning of a nephrostomy 29 tube are common urological procedures overcoming 30 ureteral obstruction from stones or extrinsic compression 31 [5]. Encrustation and super-infections are frequent draw-32 backs of indwelling devices that can lead to the occurrence 33 of sepsis. The severity of urosepsis depends mostly on the 34 host response: elderly patients, diabetics, immunosup-35 pressed individuals, and patients receiving cancer chemo-36 therapy are generally prone to severe presentation [5]. Fever 37 or hypothermia, leukocytosis or leukopenia, tachycardia, 38 and tachypnea are signs of systemic inflammation of 39 possible urological origin[5].",
