As the exponent of the distance dependence grows, the resulting networks smoothly transition from the random network limit to the regular lattice limit. We show that despite keeping the average number of contacts constant, the increasing exponent hampers the epidemic spreading as it makes long-distance connections less frequent. The growth of the number of infections is also influenced by the exponent value and changes from exponential growth to power-law growth. The resulting growth is compatible with recent analyses of the COVID-19 spreading in most countries.",

The opposite limit, \u03b4 \u2192 0, is also instructive: node distance then becomes irrelevant and the connection probability is the same, 1/(1 + \u03bb), for all nodes.

In particular, the fraction of infected nodes at a given time decreases as \u03b4 grows. This implies that the epidemic spreading can be effectively reduced by both social distancing which is now widely used during the COVID-19 epidemic (in the scope of our model, social distancing reduces the mean node degree) as well as by purposely choosing nearby contacts. In other words, a higher number of strongly localized social contacts can lead to the same fraction of infected population as a lower number of widely distributed social contacts.

Nodes on the front that can spread the infection further can then spread it in only one direction (outwards) which limits their effective reproduction number (number of nodes that they infect on average). As \u03b4 decreases, the spreading front first becomes \"diffuse\" (\u03b4 = 4) until it \"dissolves\" entirely (\u03b4 = 2).

On a regular two dimensional lattice with nearest-neighbor connections, the epidemic spreading instead develops an epidemic front that propagates at a constant velocity.

Figure 3 provides the first indication with the epidemic front becoming more diffuse and the speed of its propagation grows as \u03b4 decreases. As this happens, the argument leading to quadratic growth ceases to be valid and we expect the growth to be faster than quadratic. This is confirmed by Figure 4 where we show the epidemic dynamics for various contact networks. Growth that is of a power-law kind (it follows a straight line over a substantial part of the log-log plane in panel A) for the 2D lattice as well as for the spatial networks with \u03b4 4 becomes clearly exponential for the random network and for the spatial network with \u03b4 = 2 (see the straight lines in the log-linear panel A).",

            "text": "We find that quadratic epidemic growth on 2D lattices generalizes to power-law growth on the model spatial networks with sufficiently high exponent \u03b4. Table I shows that for the data shown in Figure 4A , stable estimates of the growth exponent (indicating good power-law fits of the data) can be obtained for \u03b4 greater or equal to 4. The resulting power-law growth exponents supported by simulations with N = 160, 000 nodes lie in the range 2-3.25. As N grows, the range of \u03b4 where a power-law fits the data well seems to expand. The results obtained on random networks and the regular square lattice (not shown) are very close to the displayed results for \u03b4 = 2 and \u03b4 = 6, respectively. Notably, the power-law exponent is not exactly two even for the square lattice. This is due to the probabilistic nature of the spreading that results in non-vanishing randomness of the spreading front that can be well seen in the first panel of Figure 3 . Finally, note that the mechanisms leading to power law growth of the number of infections studied here are very different from those studied in [20] where a diverging second Figure 4A . To focus on the straight part of the dependencies, we fit only the values below N/2 infected cases and above 100 \u2212 \u2212800 infected cases. The reported ranges of the fitted exponents correspond are obtained by varying the lower bounds. The exponent estimate for \u03b4 = 3 varies in a comparatively broader range, indicating that power-law growth is not a good fit in this case. moment of the degree distribution was the main reason for deviating from the exponential spreading pattern. In our case, by contrast, the degree distribution is narrow (Poissonian) even when it can be made broad by modifying the network model [21] . The observed power-law growth with \u03b4-dependent exponents matches the recent observations of the COVID-19 spreading in a power-law fashion. After the first reports based on data from China [22, 23] , similar results have been recently reported for nearly all countries where COVID-19 spreads [24] . Our results suggest that in the times of social distancing, the contact networks can be modeled as spatial networks with a relatively high exponent of the connecting probability decay.",

There are two main findings. Firstly, short (localized) links hinder the epidemic. We can thus achieve a better outcome (fewer infections, slower growth) by avoiding distant contacts even if the mean number of contacts remains fixed. Secondly, when short links are frequent in the network, the number of infected individuals grows as a power-law instead of the canonical exponential epidemic growth. In the framework of the chosen connection probability probability decaying with node distance as a power law, frequent short links are achieved when the exponent of the connection probability decay is high. In our simulations, power law growth of the number of infections emerges when this decay exponent is at least four. This observation is particularly relevant as the latest data show that the COVID-19 spreading in most countries indeed follows a power-law pattern instead of exponential growth. In other words, our results suggest that the social contacts over which the virus spreads are now extraordinary short which helps us to avoid the exponential spreading and thus give us more time for necessary actions.",

Finding an analytical relation between the connectivity decay exponent \u03b4 and the epidemic growth exponent and formulating effective differential equations that describe the epidemics dynamics on spatial networks are other important directions.",
