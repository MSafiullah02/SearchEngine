            "text": "Non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (NOFH) is a progressive pathological process that results in osteonecrosis and collapse due to the blocked blood supply of the femoral head, the interruption of local circulation, and the impairment of the blood supply to the subchondral bone, ultimately leading to impaired hip function and permanent disability [1, 2]. Patients always miss the best treatment opportunity because the early symptoms of NOFH are not obvious [3]. Some studies have shown that glucocorticoid (GC), which is widely used in various diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and leukemia, is an important predisposing factor for steroid-induced osteonecrosis of femoral head (SANFH) [4]. In addition, it has been confirmed that high doses of glucocorticoids are associated with the occurrence of femoral head necrosis [5]. However, there are no effective preventive measures for SANFH.",

It has been proved that the osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs in SANFH is alleviated, but the fat differentiation is promoted [9]. In addition, the proliferation ability of BMSCs is reduced in patients with SANFH [10]. Therefore, the search for molecules that can regulate the proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs is critical for identifying new targets for the prevention of SANFH.",

For example, Borton et al. revealed that Smad3 knockout mice had osteopenia after weaning [23]. Additionally, Smad3 can also participate in the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs [24]. Previous studies have suggested that lncRNA H19 can promote BMSC osteogenic differentiation, which is related to Smad3 [25]. The role of transforming growth factor-beta 1 in BMSC proliferation is also associated with Smad3 [26].",

The results of an inverted microscope showed that GC-BMSCs grew in a short fusiform or star-shaped dispersion adherent after 1 day of primary culture (Fig. 2a). After 14 days, GC-BMSCs were arranged in a sequence along the long axis of the cell body and presented a vortex shape (Fig. 2a). Subsequently, the BMSC markers (CD44 and CD45) were examined using the flow cytometry to test the purity of BMSCs. As shown in Fig. 2b, CD44 (99.29%) was positively expressed, and CD45 (0.89%) was negatively expressed in BMSCs. Then, qRT-PCR detected miR-596 expression in BMSCs induced by different concentrations of Dex (gradient concentration: 10-8 M, 10-7 M, and 10-6 M), and the results suggested that miR-596 expression was enhanced with the increase of Dex concentration (Fig. 2c). Additionally, the expression level of miR-596 in BMSCs induced by 10-7 M Dex was similar to that in BMSCs induced by 10-6 M Dex (Fig. 2c); thus, 10-7 M Dex was selected for the following experiments. As shown in Fig. 2d, the expression level of miR-596 in BMSCs was increased with the time of Dex (10-7 M) induction. Moreover, miR-596 inhibitor downregulated miR-596 expression in BMSCs, while miR-596 mimics upregulated miR-596 expression (Fig. 2e). Taken together, the results revealed that GC could increase miR-596 expression in BMSCs.\n",

ONFH is classified as traumatic and non-traumatic. Long-term use of high-dose glucocorticoids is the most common cause of NOFH, and it occurs mostly in young adults [30]. At present, the clinical treatment of NOFH includes conservative treatment (biophysical stimulation such as pulsed electromagnetic field) and surgical methods (such as core decompression), but the effect is not significant [31]. In addition, most patients undergo one or more artificial joint revision operations, which imposes serious economic and mental burdens on society and patients\u2019 families [32].

BMSCs are important stromal cells in osteogenesis and metabolism [34]. It has revealed that miR-149-3p and Runx1 can reduce the adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs and enhance the osteogenic differentiation [12, 35]. In SANFH, the researchers found that BMSCs had specific differentiation to adipocytes, while the differentiation to osteoblasts was basically stagnant [14]. In addition, Huang et al. suggested that Icariin could improve the balance between osteogenic differentiation and adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs and then reduce the bone loss of SANFH rats [36]. These findings indicate that BMSCs are the key cytological basis for the pathogenetic mechanism of SANFH [6]. Therefore, exploring the molecules involved in the process of BMSC differentiation is expected to provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of SANFH.",

For instance, miR-34a, miR-450a-5p, and miR-28-5p have been revealed to be involved in regulating the osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells [38, 39]. In BMSCs, the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation can also be regulated by miR-383 [40], miR-20a-5p [41], and miR-20a-5p [41]. Moreover, some miRNAs are reported to be involved in the development of SANFH. For example, miR-27 could promote BMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in SANFH [42], and miR-144-3p could inhibit the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in SANFH [43]. These suggest that miRNAs can participate in the process of SANFH by regulating BMSCs.",

Endo et al. demonstrated that miR-596 inhibited the growth of oral cancer through targeting LGALS3BP [45]. Wei et al. suggested that miR-596 exerted the role in glioma invasion via regulating CREPT [46]. In patients with SANFH, miR microarray analysis showed that miR-596 level in plasma was significantly elevated [18]. However, the function of miR-596 in SANFH remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we found that miR-596 was strongly expressed in bone marrow samples of patients with SANFH. Similarly, GC treatment could increase miR-596 expression in BMSCs. Moreover, GC-BMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation could be negatively regulated by miR-596. These findings indicated that miR-596 had an important role in SANFH development. To clarify this effect, we further studied the mechanism of miR-596 in SANFH.",

As a member of the SMAD family, Smad3 has been reported to participate in regulating multiple cellular functions, including BMSC osteogenic differentiation. For instance, TGF\u03b2 signaling regulated the osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs through Smad3 [47], and overexpression of lncRNA H19 promoted BMSC osteogenic differentiation via TGF-\u03b21/Smad3/HDAC signaling pathway [25]. In addition, Smad3 can also be involved in the regulation of SANFH. Hao and his colleagues revealed that miR-708 could inhibit osteogenic differentiation and promote SANFH via downregulating Smad3 [13]. In the current study, we discovered that miR-596 could negatively regulate the mRNA and protein level of Smad3, and knockdown of miR-596 showed enhancement of osteogenic differentiation and proliferation capability by increasing Smad3 in GC-BMSCs, suggesting that miR-596 might be involved in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation in SANFH. However, due to time and funding problems, the sample size of this study is small, and we will collect as many samples as possible to verify later.",
