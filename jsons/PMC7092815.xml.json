Amplification and detection were performed in an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) under the following conditions: an initial reverse transcription at 48 \u00b0C for 30 min, followed by PCR activation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min and 45 cycles of amplification (15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 1 min at 60 \u00b0C). During amplification, the ABI PRISM sequence detector monitored real-time PCR amplification by quantitative analysing fluorescence emissions. The reporter dye (FAM) signal was measured against the internal reference dye (ROX) signal to normalize for non-PCR-related fluorescence fluctuations occurring from well to well. The threshold cycle represented the refraction cycle number at which a positive amplification was measured, and was set at 10 times the standard deviation of the mean baseline emission calculated for PCR cycles 3\u20135.",

Vero E6 cells were infected with 100 CCID50 SARS-CoV. One virus replication cycle takes 5\u20136 h [26]. We therefore quantitated the effect on viral replication at 8 h postinfection, i.e., a time point at which progeny virus in the supernatant is solely derived from the first replication cycle. The compound proved equally active when added during adsorption or at 1 h after infection. This indicates that the virus does likely not interfere with the early steps of viral replication, i.e., attachment or penetration. At later time points a gradual loss of the antiviral activity of chloroquine was noted. (Fig. 3\n).",
