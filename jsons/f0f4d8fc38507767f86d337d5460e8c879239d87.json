Burke et al. tested 445 people that were in close contact (at least 6 feet from the source for a minimum of 10 min) with 10 COVID-19-confirmed patients. After two weeks of testing, only two subjects became positive. Both subjects were household members that practiced isolation from the infected individuals. Five subjects continued to expose themselves constantly with the infected individuals and never became positive. No healthcare workers (222 subjects) became positive [26] . These findings coincide with two other studies [23, 27] . Evaluation of all positive cases from mainland China showed 3.8 % being from healthcare workers (1716/44672) [28] .",

It is calculated that about 86 % of infections have remained undocumented, and about 55 % of those cases were contagious [35] .

Mild and asymptomatic cases tend to shed 10 days (between 8-15 days) after symptom resolution [16, 32, 34] , with 90 % resolving after 10 days and nearly all cases resolving after 15 days [16, 32] . Severe cases continue shedding up until 25 days after initial symptoms arise. Severe cases also have 60 times more viral load than mild cases [40] . However, the infectious potential based on severity has not been discovered.

Similar to SARS, COVID-19 binds to ACE2 to infiltrate cells [48, 49] . ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase the level of ACE2 and could therefore increase the infectivity of COVID-19. However, animal models have shown that ACE inhibitors and ARBs modulate the ACE2 levels and therefore decrease the severity of SARS pneumonia [50] . While the question regarding increased infectivity of COVID-19 remains unanswered, the mortality benefits of ACE inhibitors and ARBs for cardiovascular diseases are well-established [49] . Therefore, experts recommend continuing the medications for COVID-19 patients [49, 51, 52] . Table 3 shows the rate of symptoms presented with positive cases of COVID-19. The most common symptoms include fever (82.2 %) and cough (61.7 %) [43] [44] [45] [46] 53, 54] . These symptoms are similar to other viral respiratory diseases. However, the presentation of myalgia, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may suggest another infection instead. Viral respiratory co-infection is rare [17, [55] [56] [57] [58] .",
