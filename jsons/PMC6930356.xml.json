Newborns with complex congenital heart disease (CHD) are at particular risk for hemodynamic instability in the period immediately after birth due to their anatomic cardiovascular anomaly. An additional risk for poor transition in newborns with complex CHD is impaired function of the ANS. Since fetal conditions associated with reduced oxygen and nutrient supply (e.g., complex CHD) may impair maturation of the ANS, the ANS may be unprepared for optimal transition in newborns with complex CHD [1]. Infants with complex CHD who have a poor cardiorespiratory transition can be seen clinically as being at a higher risk for hypotension after birth and requiring greater respiratory support. Furthermore, the autonomic balance in the newborn has not yet established that of the mature ANS, since vagal tone continues to increase through infancy [2].",

Both of these types of CHD are diagnosed in the fetal period or in the immediate postnatal period and require surgery within a few days to weeks after birth. In HLHS, the left side of the heart is small and may provide inadequate systemic and cerebral perfusion; central mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood results in hypoxemic cerebral perfusion. Similarly, in TGA, the aorta and pulmonary arteries are transposed, with the more deoxygenated stream ascending through the aorta into the cerebral circulation. These cardiac anomalies may therefore predispose to both cerebral hypoxemia and hypoperfusion during fetal brain development, leading to potential dysmaturation of the central ANS centers. There is additional risk for ischemic brain injury in the period of transition after birth [3].",

HRV is the fluctuation in the length of time between successive heart beats (R\u2013R intervals) and provides a measure of sympathetic and parasympathetic function, and therefore ANS balance [4, 5]. In the fetus and premature infant, maturation of the ANS toward term gestational age is normally associated with an increase in parasympathetic tone [6], but fetuses with HLHS show reduced HRV compared to healthy control fetuses at a similar gestational age, indicating a delayed maturation of the ANS even prior to birth [7]. However, the ANS balance in infants with complex CHD during the fetal-to-neonatal transition immediately following birth has not been well established. The objective of this study was to compare changes in autonomic tone, as measured by HRV time- and frequency-domain metrics, between infants with complex CHD (TGA or HLHS) and low-risk term control infants. We hypothesized that infants with complex CHD would have lower metrics of HRV (depressed autonomic balance) in the early postnatal preoperative period than the controls.",

Long-term variability is influenced by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, whereas short-term variability is influenced more by the parasympathetic nervous system, based on rapid ANS needs [13]. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a modified root mean square (RMS) analysis approach that is based on the principles of statistical physics and is designed to counter nonstationarity in RRi [10, 14]. Since accelerations and decelerations in infant heart rate can be caused by infant movement, the heart rate is nonstationary, and DFA provides a way to account for this type of data. This approach is now widely used [15]. Briefly, this method involves (1) calculating the profile function as the cumulative sum of the RRi values; (2) partitioning the profile function into nonoverlapping windows containing a particular number of beats, denoted s; (3) fitting the profile inside each window using a polynomial function; (4) calculating the local fluctuation function in each window as the root mean square of the deviation of the profile from the best fit; and (5) calculating the global fluctuation function as the median of the local fluctuation functions over all windows. Steps 2\u20135 are repeated for each 10-min epoch. In step (3), we used a fourth-order polynomial function (DFA4), and the value of s was increased in small steps from 6 beats to one-fourth the total number of beats in a 10-min epoch. We derived the following metrics using the fluctuation functions: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\alpha_{\\text{S}}$$\\end{document}\u03b1S and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\alpha_{\\text{L}}$$\\end{document}\u03b1L; these are the slope of the fluctuation function between beats 15 and 30 and the slope of the fluctuation function between beat 35 and the beat corresponding to one-fourth of the total number of samples, respectively (Fig. 1).

High-frequency (HF) variability reflects parasympathetic function and is influenced by the respiratory rate, while low-frequency (LF) variability is due to a combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs and baroreflex-induced changes in HR [16]. We used Welch\u2019s periodogram approach to calculate the power spectrum of the RRi in every 10-min epoch. This method involves partitioning the RRi into 30-s windows (so that the frequency resolution of the resulting spectrum is 0.033 Hz) and calculating the periodogram as the square of the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the RRi in that window. We obtained an estimate of the power spectrum as the average of the periodograms from all windows. Using the power spectrum, we calculated the following four metrics: the LF and HF powers as the logarithm of the median spectral power in 0.05\u20130.25 Hz and the logarithm of the median spectral power in 0.3\u20131 Hz, respectively; the normalized LF (nLF) and normalized HF (nHF) as the ratio of the sum of the spectral power in 0.05\u20130.25 Hz to the total power and the ratio of the sum of the spectral power in 0.3\u20131 Hz to the total power, respectively. Total power was calculated as the sum of the spectral power in 0.05\u20132 Hz. The normalized spectral powers (nLF and nHF) are dimensionless quantities. The units of the absolute spectral powers are decibels (dB). We did not include the LF/HF ratio since this may not effectively characterize changes in ANS function in all circumstances [17].",

Compared to controls, we showed that newborns with complex CHD have depression of the sympathetic nervous system and, to a lesser extent, the parasympathetic nervous system during the early postnatal period. Although nHF was higher in infants with CHD than in controls, this is not interpreted as greater changes in parasympathetic tone, since the absolute value of HF was less than in control infants. Due to normalization, nHF increased because of a relative suppression of sympathetic power (nLF) compared to parasympathetic power, as normalized frequencies are modeled to sum to a value of one. Our study methods employed widely used HRV metrics and newer DFA methods [18\u201323]. Importantly, the measured autonomic depression remained significant after controlling for medication exposures in the infants with CHD. The knowledge that infants with CHD demonstrate impairment in both sympathetic and parasympathetic balance and have a complex anatomic abnormality that may complicate physiological adaptation during the transitional period may in future be used to improve the care of newborns with complex CHD. For example, impairment in autonomic balance may precede clinically significant hypotension. Since the sympathetic nervous system is important for maintaining cerebral blood flow and cerebral autoregulation, lower autonomic balance could disrupt cerebral blood flow such that it drops below the threshold of autoregulation, affecting cerebral perfusion [24]. With the additional circulatory effects of the anatomic cardiac anomalies in these infants, such an impairment in autonomic balance might further increase the risk of impaired cerebral perfusion and oxygenation during the fetal-to-postnatal transition.",

Adverse intrauterine conditions are known to increase the risk for disturbed fetal development, especially brain development [27\u201331]. Fetuses with complex CHD, including TGA and HLHS, undergo intrauterine brain development under conditions of tenuous cerebral oxygen delivery. Given the normal rapid development of the central ANS during the third trimester, it is reasonable to speculate that autonomic maturation may also be disturbed in newborns with complex CHD, which is supported by the postnatal HRV data in our study.",

Several studies have focused on the effect of CHD on HRV characteristics in the fetal period [7, 32]. In a study by Siddiqui et al. [7], using fetal ECG recordings, the authors found a decrease in HRV in fetuses with cyanotic CHD compared to controls. This difference was only significant at gestational ages of between 34 and 38 weeks in fetuses with HLHS, while TGA fetuses showed HRV that was not significantly different from controls at any gestational age [7]. Specific analysis of the sympathetic versus parasympathetic balance was not described [7]. In a study comparing intrapartum fetal heart rate between fetuses with CHD and controls, severe variable decelerations and prolonged decelerations occurred more often in fetuses with CHD than in controls [33]. These features were attributed to a difference in autonomic balance, with a more pronounced parasympathetic response occurring in infants with a potentially lower hypoxemic reserve than in fetuses without CHD. In infants, a hypoxic state may affect ANS function through afferent effects on chemoreceptors that modulate autonomic balance [24].",

Infants undergoing critical care with CHD are exposed to multiple agents with potential autonomic effects, such as the sedatives, medications for hypotension, neuromuscular blocker agents, and prostaglandin E1 that were used in our study population. After controlling for these medication types, we found a persistence of significant autonomic depression in the CHD infants that was shown to be independent of medication exposure.",

To mitigate the influence of heart rate on the variability analysis of RRi, it has been suggested that the RRi should be normalized by the mean heart rate or by the exponential of the mean heart rate. Since the exact nature of the relation between the variability in RRi and the mean heart rate is not clear, we have not explored this option in our study. Furthermore, the normalization should not affect the normalized spectral power. Since the results for the normalized low frequency and absolute low frequency show a similar trend, we believe that our results are unbiased characterizations of autonomic tone.",

            "text": "Our study has a number of strengths, but it also has limitations, including those inherent to a retrospective study design. Since our normative dataset for HRV consisted of recordings performed in the first 24\u201348 h after birth, it enabled us to compare infants with complex CHD to control infants at a similar postnatal age. We were, however, unable to compare the control infants to CHD infants at a later time period since the controls only underwent one ECG session. Infants with CHD were studied at an earlier hour of age than the control infants, due to earlier availability of the CHD infants\u2019 data upon admission to our tertiary care children\u2019s hospital compared to the control newborns, who were prospectively recruited following birth. While this difference is statistically significant, the biological difference is likely insignificant. Since the ANS maturation after birth is unlikely to be on the scale of hours, we doubt that this small time difference accounts for the differences in ANS maturation between our cases and controls [4, 34]. Furthermore, a larger number of infants with TGA were on mechanical ventilation due to a need for balloon atrial septostomy compared to the infants with HLHS. We controlled for medication exposure and evaluated for the impact of mechanical ventilation in our infants with CHD in order to check if this clinical difference impacted the HRV findings. Children\u2019s National is a referral center for neonatal cardiac surgery with no delivery services. Thus, all except one of the CHD cases were outborn, and many were started on PGE1 treatment prior to their arrival at our institution. Prostaglandins are known to exert effects on the ANS and thus might have played some role in the results of our study. The control infants were low-risk term newborns and therefore did not have exposure to postnatal medication or mechanical ventilation, in contrast to the infants with CHD.",

Reduced autonomic balance in the early postnatal preoperative period may be due to the impact of prenatal hypoxemia and altered hemodynamics on the developing brain and ANS. Over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that the high prevalence of long-term neurodevelopmental morbidity in survivors of certain CHD types is likely due to an accumulation of neurologic insults at multiple points in time, including the fetal, pre-, intra-, and postoperative periods. Further studies are required to evaluate the impact of impaired ANS function in newborns with CHD on their clinical course in the cardiac intensive care unit and on long-term neurologic outcome.",
