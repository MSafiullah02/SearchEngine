These tasks have numerous applications in social network analysis, bioinformatics, computational chemistry, and graph theory in general. Unfortunately, large orders (number of vertices) and massive sizes (number of edges) prove to be challenging when applying general-purpose data mining techniques on graphs. Moreover, in many real-world scenarios, graphs in a dataset have varying orders and sizes, hindering the application of data mining algorithms devised for vector spaces. Thus, devising a framework to compare graphs with different orders and sizes would allow for rich analysis and knowledge discovery in many practical domains.",

In a supervised setting, these feature vectors are learned through neural networks [14, 25, 26]. In unsupervised settings, the feature vectors are descriptive statistics of the graph such as average degree, the eigenspectrum, or spectra of sub-graphs of order at most k contained in the graph [7, 11, 17, 18, 22, 23].",

Direct approaches for evaluating the similarity/distance between a pair of graphs preserve the entire structure of both graphs. The most prominent method under this approach is the Graph Edit Distance (ged), which counts the number of edit operations (insertion/deletion of vertices/edges) required to convert a given graph to another [16]. Although intuitive, ged is stymied by its computational intractability. Computing distance based on the vertex permutation that minimizes the \u201cerror\u201d between the adjacency representations of two graphs is a difficult task [1], and proposed relaxations of these distances are not robust to permutation [2]. An efficient algorithm for large network comparison DeltaCon, is proposed in [9] but it is only feasible when there is a valid one-to-one correspondence between vertices of the two graphs.",

A kernel function is then defined, which serves as a pairwise similarity measure that takes as input a pair of graphs and outputs a non-negative real number. Typically, the kernel value is the inner-product between two feature vectors corresponding to the two graphs. This so-called kernel trick has been used successfully to evaluate pairwise of other structures such as images and sequences [4, 10, 12]. Several graph kernels based on sub-structural patterns have been proposed, such as the Shortest-Path [5] and Graphlet [17] kernels. More recently, a hierarchical kernel based on propagating spectral information within the graph [11] was introduced. The WL-Kernel [18] that is based on the Weisfeller-Lehman isomorphism test has been shown to provide excellent results for classification and is used as a benchmark in the graph representation learning literature. Kernels require expensive computation and typically necessitate storing the adjacency matrices, making them infeasible for massive graphs.",

The descriptors we propose are based on graph comparison methods that meet these requirements due to their graph-theoretic nature and feature scaling based on the graph\u2019s magnitude.
