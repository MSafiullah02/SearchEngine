When issues are identified, the IP&C team intervenes to ensure that safe quality care is provided. Yet, IP&C strategies, for the most part, specifically target adult healthcare institutions [11]. Therefore, specialized programs need to be developed and tailored to meet the needs of the pediatric population, taking into account age-related factors that prevent the child from adhering to IP&C standards, as well as taking into account the impact that caregivers have on prevention and transmission. Without these specialized IP&C programs, there is a higher risk for developing HAIs due to developmental stages, social dependencies, differing diagnostic strategies, and immature immune systems [10], [12], [13].",

Although monitoring compliance is a well-known concept in relation to HAIs (outcome indicators) [5], no specific key performance indicator(s) (KPI) for IP&C practices (process indicators) have been established and approved internationally [20], [21]. The authors believe that to ensure compliance with basic IP&C principles (target processes such as hand hygiene, standard precautions and transmission-based precautions), robust KPIs need to be monitored, focusing on targeted processes. The results and recommendations need to be reported to key stakeholders, including higher management, which will subsequently help to reduce HAIs by ensuring that all HCWs are held responsible and accountable for their practice.",

This includes staffing numbers and levels of experience, early detection and intervention in outbreak situations [7], environmental controls, adequate supplies, and programs for education.

Outbreaks of infectious pathogens can result in patient morbidity/mortality, environmental contamination, and/or HCW absenteeism. Implementation of appropriate measures to minimize or prevent transmission is of paramount importance. It is well documented that pediatric and the immunocompromised shed viruses for longer periods of time [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. This alters and increases the potential duration of the preventative measures required and risks involved. Cohorting can be an effective preventative strategy in selected circumstances. It may be required during outbreaks when there is limited resources and increased occupancy. Consultation with experts in the IP&C and Infectious Disease fields is vital to ensure appropriate utilization of resources in decision-making and promoting adherence with standard and transmission-based precautions (contact, droplet or airborne) [7], [11], [28].",

Most, if not all, patients in PICUs have invasive devices inserted or have undergone invasive procedures (e.g., surgical) that require preventative measures. There needs to be individualized and unique considerations taken into account for the pediatric population, such as developmental age, levels of mobility, understanding, and appropriate products that are age-related, i.e., chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) [27].",

At present, there is limited research about the attributable outcomes and effects of Gram-negative MDROs (in particular, beta-lactam resistant Gram-negative bacilli/extended-spectrum beta-lactamases [ESBLs] and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae [CRE]) within the pediatric population. This includes the areas of morbidity, mortality, length of stay (LOS), burden and cost to healthcare services [57].",

Therefore, MDRO pathogens can be spread easily via direct and indirect routes, are often difficult to treat and eradicate, are viable within the environment, and can remain on the skin whether as a result of colonization or as an infection for extended periods of time. Emphasizing preventive measures is important. These measures include hand hygiene, controlling environmental contamination, caregiver education, decolonization (if appropriate), appropriate PPE usage, and judicious antimicrobial controls [9], [27], [47], [57], [58], [59]. However, little consensus exists regarding appropriate isolation precaution standards for ESBLs and CRE in the context of known prolonged shedding among the immunocompromised pediatric population [60].",
