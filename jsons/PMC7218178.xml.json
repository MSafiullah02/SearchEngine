In addition to those staff who are unable to work due to self-isolation, our Division of Paediatric Emergency Medicine decided to insulate our at-risk staff physicians who were over 60 years of age, had significant comorbidities, or were pregnant. Understandably, during a health care crisis, the loss of these valuable staff members shifts the burden onto the remaining frontline health care providers. Additionally, the displacement and sudden lack of perceived purpose can be frustrating to those who are used to providing direct clinical care and who want to help with the crisis. While virtual care has been heralded as a solution in many outpatient environments, it is more challenging in an ED because the clinician has no prior rapport with the patient, the patient problems are typically higher risk, and the physical exam component of a patient assessment is often essential to making an accurate diagnosis.",

This was relatively straightforward to achieve from a funding perspective as our department has an alternate funding plan model. Unlike true virtual care where there is no expectation of a physical examination, the patients being reviewed virtually have undergone a triage assessment with documentation of vital signs, and a physical examination by a physician assistant (PA). In addition to helping with patient flow, our virtual attending has also helped to offload the administrative burden of the on-site team by taking outside phone calls, managing late-arriving test results, and handling discrepant radiology reports. By managing multiple issues from off-site, directly and indirectly valuable personal protective equipment (PPE) is also conserved. Undertaking these tasks from home is facilitated by a robust electronic medical record (EMR) system that can be accessed remotely. Roles in the virtual review model are summarized in Figure 1.\n",

At our center, the virtual attending and their delegate touch base at the beginning of a shift. The virtual attending shares responsibility for selecting appropriate patients for virtual review. Some lower acuity patients lend themselves well to a virtual review model, especially those presenting with mild illness or contact exposure and hoping only to be evaluated or tested for COVID-19 infection. In our department, most patients who undergo virtual review are Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) 4 or 5, have a relatively straightforward complaint, and do not require an in-depth physical exam. While we have approached patient selection cautiously given the novelty of this model, we are actively expanding to include other patients that require minimal physical examination (referred stable subspecialty patients, mental health patients with departmental social work support, etc).",

During the pandemic, our physicians have been less available to take phone calls when frequently donning and doffing PPE between patient rooms, along with the need to clean the phone after each use. The virtual attending has taken over these incoming calls, by having our unit clerk forward the calls to the virtual attending. At the end of the call, depending on the complexity of the case, the virtual physician may relay the information to the on-site physician or nursing team leader if required, otherwise, documentation is noted in our EMR system. This process is not used for critically unwell patients or trauma calls where arrival may be imminent and/or urgent management decisions are required. Although not done at our hospital, the virtual attending could expand their role depending on a given department's needs\u2014they could take EMS patch calls, lead discussions from local long-term care homes, and consult more broadly with community providers.",

This workload has increased significantly, as our hospitals is now doing COVID-19 testing in-house. In an effort to provide patient-centered care, we have been notifying families of both positive and negative test results. This has created additional administrative burden to the providers facilitating these call-backs. Having the virtual physician at home who can manage these results by calling patients or families can significantly decrease the anxiety felt by patients and caregivers, and reduce the workload of the on-site team. They are also able to fix/change outpatient prescriptions, call back patients with positive blood cultures and update families with any diagnostic imaging discrepancies.",
