To date, the A(H7N9) virus has been identified from environmental samples and several different poultry species (chickens, ducks, pigeons, quail) collected in live bird markets, but not from any free-living wild bird species. Human and avian A(H7N9) viruses exhibit high degrees of sequence similarity, even though the virus has already diversified into several different lineages [2].",

Our analysis shows that the age-specific and sex-specific patterns of morbidity and mortality from A(H7N9) exhibit even greater disparities with those of A(H5N1) from countries other than China. Although individuals less than 20 years old comprise nearly 50% of human A(H5N1) cases worldwide [11], only 8% of A(H7N9) cases with data available, and no deaths, were reported from this age group. The 20\u201329 age group, which includes only 4% of A(H7N9) cases, comprises 22.4% of all A(H5N1) cases reported since 2003 [12]. Only one case of A(H7N9) has been documented among individuals 10\u201319 years of age, the age group with the highest cumulative PFC (74%) from A(H5N1).

The majority of reported MERS-CoV patients have exhibited respiratory symptoms, and most MERS-CoV cases are hospitalized with severe ARDS, as was the case for nearly all reported influenza H7N9 cases [17]. The median age of MERS-CoV patients is 55 years (range: 2\u201394), versus a median for H7N9 of 60 years (range 2\u201391). The MERS-CoV had a male: female case ratio in those older than 60-years of 2.3\u20131, while that of H7N9 was 2.4\u20131. Only 4 of 95 (4.2%) MERS-CoV cases were individuals aged <24 years [17], [18]. More than 50% of all A(H7N9) cases had underlying conditions, and most fatal cases MERS-CoV also have pre-existing medical conditions [18], [19], [20]. While existing chronic disease conditions are recognized as a significant risk factor for human infections by A(H7N9) and MERS-CoV, this has not been the case for the A(H5N1) virus in China or eslewhere [21]. However, the cumulative PFC for MERS-CoV (47%) is more similar to that of H5N1 (59%) than that of H7N9 (22%).",

We hope that this analysis will stimulate further interest in identifying and evaluating environmental, ecological, economic and cultural factors that may contribute to the emergence and proliferation of novel zoonotic pathogens within and among human populations worldwide.",
