In contrast, any patient with fever or ILI/acute respiratory illness (ARI)/severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) should be clinically assessed for possible COVID-19, regardless of travel history or exposure. Since there are no specific COVID-19 signs and symptoms, relying on them to exclude the disease can be misleading. Nevertheless, medical history is essential in the evaluation and, as in any other clinical scenario, offers key clues. Therefore, a careful evaluation of patient symptoms is highly encouraged.",

            "text": "Concerning COVID-19, fever is reported as one of the most common symptoms, in several studies, ranging in prevalence between 76.5 and 98.6% [8\u201316]. Fever is rarely a stand-alone symptom, rather it associates with non-productive cough (in 50\u201370% of cases) [8\u201316] and dyspnoea (in 30\u201360% of cases) [13]. At COVID-19 onset, cough is almost invariably non-productive [17\u201327], although it may subsequently evolve with sputum production in up to half of cases [9] when the disease progresses or a bacterial superinfection ensues. The prevalence of cough and dyspnoea appears to increase in patients who subsequently require intensive care support (88% for both) [28]. Thus, the two additional manifestations of cough and dyspnoea may also portend a prognostic significance, guiding the family doctor in the subsequent management steps. Fever and cough almost always occur at the same time, whereas dyspnea typically begins some 5\u20137 days later [9].",

Worthy of mention are some neurological manifestations of COVID-19, such as anosmia, hyposmia and dysgeusia, even though few scientific data are available at present about their prevalence. In a Chinese study focused on neurological findings in 214 COVID-19 patients, hypogeusia and hyposmia were detected in 12 (5.6%) and 11 (5.1%) of them, respectively [29]. Three expert statements from the American, British and French associations of otorhinolaryngology also underline the importance of these sensory abnormalities. However, such professional body statements are largely based on emerging anecdotal and non-peer reviewed clinical observations [30].",

            "text": "Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms, including nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea, appear to be seldom reported (4.8 and 4%, respectively) [10, 12]. Similarly, other signs of URTI are also observed rarely: throat congestion (1.7\u20134%), tonsil swelling (2.1%) and lymph node enlargement (0.2%) [11, 12]. Thus, the presence of these latter manifestations in a febrile patient could either point against COVID-19 or indicate a milder form of disease that does not tend to further evolve. Indeed, it is necessary to underline that the vast majority of these data comes from studies on hospitalized patients, both in and out of the intensive care unit (ICU), and very few reports have been generated on mild and non-admitted cases. Among the latter, the prevalence of URTI signs/symptoms may be much higher and, therefore, predict a more favourable outcome. Other symptoms, not specific to COVID-19, could be useful to early predict patient outcome. Indeed, Wang et al. showed that patients admitted to ICU had a statistically higher prevalence of anorexia, shortness of breath and dizziness [9].",

            "text": "In Table 1, we compare clinical presentation and outcome of COVID-19 [31] with those of SARS [32\u201334] and influenza A (H1N1 2009 outbreak) [35, 36], as examples of recent SARIs, and with common ILIs, including seasonal flu (H3N2) [37\u201340] and non-influenza acute respiratory illnesses [38, 39]. Since data of COVID-19 are largely preliminary and come from studies on mostly hospitalized patients, the prevalence of certain symptoms may differ from the real clinical spectrum of the disease, that is mostly comprised of mildly symptomatic and non-severe cases (around 80%) [41], as for all disorders considered. For example, regarding influenza A, URTI signs and symptoms are much more common in community than hospitalized cases (Table 1). A similar trend may exist for COVID-19, but might be hidden by the different populations considered. Notwithstanding, the prevalence of URTI signs/symptoms remains much lower in COVID-19- than in H1N1-hospitalized cases. Furthermore, it is interesting to compare the COVID-19 clinical spectrum with that of diseases caused by more phylogenetically similar viruses. In fact, in the 2002\u20132003 SARS outbreak, there was a higher percentage of URTI signs/symptoms as well as a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms [32\u201334] (Table 1). This is most likely not due to a selection bias, as SARS studies largely enrolled hospitalized patients too. In conclusion, there is a paucity of information regarding the presence and epidemiological significance of mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in SARS [42], as well as COVID-19.",

Undoubtedly, suspicion index of COVID-19 declines when the patient presents with recurrence of febrile illnesses related to prior known conditions, including urinary tract infections, exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and flares of immune-mediated conditions. If fever quickly responds to antibiotic therapy, COVID-19 should not be a concern. Therefore, it remains crucial to collect a comprehensive drug history on chronic and/or recently added medications. Indeed, fever of COVID-19 tends to persist for several days when the disease progresses towards more severe stages and does so despite any antibiotic therapy until resolution or progression [17\u201327].",

Theoretically, COVID-19 should mimic atypical pneumonia, being characterized by a clinical\u2013radiological dissociation. Therefore, the absence of added sounds on lung auscultation should not rule out COVID-19 pneumonia. In contrast, pleural effusion is very rarely seen in COVID-19 (about 5% of cases), especially in the early phase of the disease [43]. Given the lack of thoracic examination findings, clinicians should pay attention to any sign of acute or acute on chronic respiratory failure, such as central cyanosis, tachypnoea, use of accessory muscles, and should always assess peripheral oxygen saturation by means of a pulse oximeter. The timing of onset of respiratory distress is typical in COVID-19, and usually occurs between day 5 and day 7 of illness [9, 12]. This is also the observed median outpatient\u2013inpatient interval, equal to 6.8 days [8].",

Less commonly, there is elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and fibrinogen d-dimers. Zhou et al. showed that d-dimers (> 1 \u03bcg/mL) were the only blood marker independently correlated to a worse outcome, together with age and a SOFA score between 6 and 14 [16]. Moreover, leukopenia, lymphopenia and d-dimers elevation are more prominent in severe cases [12]. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 mainly acts on T lymphocytes, triggering cytokine upregulation and immune stimulation that exhausts immune cells, finally blunting cellular immune responses. Damage to T lymphocytes may be an important factor leading to patient deterioration. The role of the immune system in COVID-19 is still undefined but cytokine storm syndromes and immunosuppression have been proposed among factors leading to death in these patients [44]. Concerning IL-6, higher blood levels of this cytokine correlate with a worse outcome [45].",

These lesions are mainly located peripherally and sub-pleural with diffuse, bilateral distribution. Less common CT findings include nodules, cystic changes, bronchiolar ectasia, pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy [9\u201311, 13, 14, 22, 26, 28]. Since COVID-19-related patchy or confluent lesions tend to distribute peripherally and sub-pleural, lung ultrasound (LUS) has a major diagnostic role. LUS is non-invasive, safe, fast, low cost and can be repeated bedside to monitor evolution and the effects of therapies. Also, it may aid to optimize ventilation and weaning in the ICU setting [49] and reduces the need for patient movement within the hospital environment. However, LUS is unable to correctly identify pulmonary embolism or pulmonary arterial thrombosis that are emerging as common and prognostically relevant conditions in COVID-19, likely contributing to both severe respiratory failure and mortality [16].",

Detecting specific antibodies, especially IgM, which are produced rapidly after infection, can be a less expensive tool to combine with rRT-PCR to enhance detection sensitivity and accuracy. It seems that in the acute phase of COVID-19, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgA antibodies are both detectable at a median time of 5 days after symptom onset, while IgG antibodies appear after a median time of 14 days [52]. Zhao et al. reported that combining RNA and antibody testing, especially total antibody measurement, sensitivity for detecting COVID-19 in the first week of disease raises significantly, up to 78.7% [53]. These findings suggest that serological tests could be an important complement to RNA detection during the illness course, although further studies are warranted [53].",

In 2017, the British National Health System endorsed the updated NEWS2 score that can be applied both in emergency and inpatient setting, for initial assessment and serial monitoring of patients [56]. This score is based on the measurement of six vital signs: respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, systolic blood pressure, heart rate and state of consciousness. Each parameter is graded in levels, to which a numerical value is assigned; the sum of numerical values provides a reliable measure of deviation from normal physiology. If oxygen supplementation is required, the score is increased by two points. Based on total score, there are three levels of clinical alert: a low level (NEWS2 0\u20134) requiring fast clinical evaluation by a competent nurse; a medium level (NEWS2 5\u20136), needing prompt appraisal by a skilled clinician; and a high level (NEWS2 \u2265 7), necessitating emergency assessment of a critical care team [57]. However, as no studies have been done to validate the performance of NESW2 in defining the severity of illness or the evolution of COVID-19, the NEWS2 score should be used with caution in this specific setting.",

As shown, dissociation between clinical features, diagnostic test results and response to treatment may occur, making COVID-19 management challenging. However, we have shown evidence to support the fact that knowledge of the natural history of the disease may aid the internist in putting common and unspecific symptoms into the correct clinical context. Internists should refrain from indiscriminate application of diagnostic tests, and should be guided by clinical observation and reasoning towards the best management practice patterns. Such a correct approach will improve health care resource utilization, minimize psychologic distress, adequately protect the community and convey the optimal care to the subset of COVID-19 patients with a more severe clinical course.
