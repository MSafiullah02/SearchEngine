Two HPeV types isolated and identified in 1961 as echovirus 22 and 23 of the genus Enterovirus [2] were then re-named HPeV1 and HPeV2, respectively, in the 1990s [3, 4] . HPeV are ubiquitous viruses found throughout the world that frequently cause upper respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis, and sometimes meningitis and sepsis-like syndrome, in children. Recently, HPeV was reported to cause epidemic myositis in adults in Japan [5] . Although various viruses have been reported to cause adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for respiratory viruses in past representative studies of adult CAP did not include HPeV, and their involvement in adult lower respiratory tract infection is unknown.",

He had developed productive cough, sore throat, and nasal discharge three weeks before, muscle pain two weeks before, and fever and dyspnea three days before his admission. He had no medical, family, or social history of note, and no close contact with infected people. He was an ex-smoker (10 pack-years). His vital signs included a body temperature of 37.6 \ufffd C, heart rate of 116 beats/min with a regular rhythm, and blood pressure of 137/84 mmHg. On physical examination, fine crackles were audible on the dorsal side of the bilateral lower lung regions, but no other remarkable findings were seen. Chest X-ray showed consolidation and reduced volume of the right lung ( Fig. 1-A) . Computed tomography (CT) (Fig. 2 ) on admission showed bilateral consolidation (right dominant), ground-glass opacities (GGOs) around the consolidations, and air-bronchogram accompanying traction bronchiectasis within the consolidations. The GGOs in part had nonsegmental distribution. His arterial blood gases under ambient air showed a pH of 7.45, PaO 2 of 70.2 Torr, PaCO 2 of 35.7 Torr, and bicarbonate of 24.3 mmol/L, and biochemical examination of his blood and urine showed elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and Creactive protein and aspartate aminotransferase levels. Pneumococcal and Legionella urinary antigen test, Mycoplasma antigen from throat swab specimens, and influenza antigen from nasal swab specimens were all negative. Autoantibodies were negative. No bacteria other than oral flora were cultured in the sputum cultures. We performed bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in the right middle lobe (with 20 of 150 mL recovered). The total cell count of the BAL fluid was 5.3 \ufffd 10 5 cells/mL, including 44.7% lymphocytes (cluster designation [CD]4/CD8 ratio, 3.16), 7.1% eosinophils, and 23.9% neutrophils.

Therefore, the frequency of HPeV infection in adult CAP is unknown. In our two cases, we used a commercially available kit for detection of respiratory pathogens on a Rotor-Gene Q instrument (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a multiplex RT-PCR, which can detect HPeV. In addition, HPeVs were detected from BAL fluid, which increases the possibility of our two cases being pneumonia.",
