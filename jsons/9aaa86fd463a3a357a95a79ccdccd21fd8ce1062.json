            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic resulting from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which emerged in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan in the province Hubei has placed immense burden on national economies and global health. At present neither vaccination nor therapies are available although several antiviral agents such as remdesivir, originally an Ebola drug, nelfinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor and other drugs such as lopinavir have been evaluated. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of RNA-sequencing data from three studies employing human lung epithelial cells. Of these one focused on lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. We aimed at identifying genes co-expressed with angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) the human cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and unveiled several genes correlated or inversely correlated with high significance, among the most significant of these was the transmembrane serine protease 4 (TMPRSS4). Serine proteases are known to be involved in the infection process by priming the virus spike protein. Pathway analysis revealed papilloma virus infection amongst the most significantly correlated pathways. Gene Ontologies revealed regulation of viral life cycle, immune responses, proinflammatory responses-several interleukins such as IL6, IL1, IL20 and IL33, IFI16 regulating the interferon response to a virus, chemo-attraction of macrophages, last and not least cellular stress resulting from activated Reactive Oxygen Species. We believe that this dataset will aid in a better understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying COVID-19.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory disease COVID-19 is a result of infections with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 first reported in the Chinese city Wuhan, Province Hubei, in December 2019 and has since 11 March 2020 been designated as a pandemic by WHO. The origin of the virus is still under investigation although some studies suggest that it was transferred from another species, possibly pangolins 1 or bats 2 . At the end of April 2020 the number of globally confirmed cases of COVID-19 exceeded 3 million and recorded deaths beyond 200,000 in the real-time statistics of the Johns Hopkins University 3 . Due to many unreported and asymptomatic cases, the infection fatality rate (IFR) is difficult to determine however Verity et al. estimate approximately 0.66% (0\u00b739-1\u00b733) in China 4 . The age-associated IFR is approximately 7.8% for those above 80 years 4 . Drugs have been repurposed for stabilizing COVID-19, but these are not effective therapies 5 , examples include such as remdesivir (Ebola) 6, 7 , hydroxychloroquine (Malaria) 6, 7 and nelfinavir (HIV) 8 . Another treatment option is to indirectly immunize individuals with plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients 9 . Further approaches aim at mimicking the human virus cell entry receptor ACE2 2 with human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) 10 . The cell entry receptor ACE2 associates with transmembrane proteases which prime the spike protein of the virus. Hoffmann et al. assigned this task to the protein TMPRSS2 11 which they identified in the predecessor virus SARS-CoV-2 and assume it is the same for SARS-CoV-2. The protease can be inhibited by existing compounds to interrupt further propagation of the virus in the human host.",

Figure 2 shows the genes most significantly (Bonferoni-adjusted p < 1E-11) correlated (red to yellow in last column) or anti-correlated (green) with ACE2 (full table in suppl. Table 3 ). The transmembrane serine protease 4 (TMPRSS4) is one of the most significantly correlated (r=0.9142, p=4.59E-20) with ACE2 therefore implying a major role in priming the CoV-2 spike protein. CXCL17 (r=0.9273, p=1.1E-21), ABCA12 (r=0.9256, p=1-92E-21) and ATP10B (r=0.9193, p=1.14E-20) had marginally higher correlation with ACE2 while another transmembrane protease TMPRS11E (r=0.9121, p=7.91E-20) had a slightly lower correlation. The expression of CXCL17 is probably due to a reaction on the infection by chemo-attracting macrophages 13 . A The role of ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 12 (ABCA12) is not fully elucidated with respect to COVID-19 but assumed to transport lipid via lipid granules to the intracellular space and transporting specific proteases -in the case of harlequin ichtyosis associated with desquamation 14 . Current knowledge on ATP10B is scarce. However, Wilk et al. (Table 3 in their publication) report Atp10b gene expression levels as highly inversely (negative) correlated with influenza gene expression changes in infected C57BL/6J mice 15 . In Figure 3a a cluster analysis and gene expression heatmap of the 72 most significantly (Bonferoni-adjusted p < 1E-11) correlated and anti-correlated genes with ACE2 shows close clustering of the serine protease TMPRSS4 with ACE2. Also in this analysis of 72 genes SARS-CoV-2 (red color bar) cluster together with mock-infected SARS lung epithelial cells separated from the other lung cells (blue color bar indicates control). In the heatmap presented in Figure 3b , TMPRSS family members TMPRSS11D/E and TMPRSS4 show close clustering with ACE2 but also TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS13 have similar expression in all experiments, especially in the SARS-CoV-2 infected samples.",

The virus receptor ACE2 is involved in the positive regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolic process (p=0.0185). Induction of ROS by a respiratory virus and subsequent inflammation has been reported Jamaluddin et al. 22 .",

The connection of ACE2 to calmodulin 1 (CALM1) is based on a publication by Lambert et al. 25 in which they show that CALM1 interacts with the corona virus receptor ACE2 and inhibits shedding of its ectodomain 25 . CALM1 inhibitors in turn can revert this process so that the ACE2 ectodomain is shed partially mediated by a metalloproteinase 25 . The direct connection between CALM1 and LIMA1 was found in a large-scale interactome study 26 .

We found a signature of genes positively or negatively correlated with ACE2 amongst which the most outstanding was the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS4. In a recent publication Hoffmann et al 11 . inferred from the knowledge that the preceding virus SARS-CoV uses ACE2 as receptor for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike protein priming that the new virus SARS-CoV-2 11 would do the same. While the involvement of the receptor ACE2 appears to be established 1,10 the use of TMPRSS2 for spike protein priming appears not fully settled as Hoffmann et al. still have to concede \"that SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells was inhibited but not abrogated by camostat mesylate\" (serine protease inhibitor with activity against TMPRSS2) 11 . The high significance (r=0.9142, p=4.59E-20) in our co-expression analysis with ACE2 suggests that TMPRSS4 is a considerable candidate for spike protein priming. However, TMPRSS4 is closely related to TMPRSS2 which both can proteolytically cleave the hemagglutinin of influenza viruses 27 working best together with cathepsin B/L inhibitors. We propose to investigate the effect of TMPRSS4 inhibitors in further research. As TMPRSS4 has been implicated in the invasion and metastasis of several cancers it has been also considered as target for cancer therapy for which a modest inhibitory effect of the above mentioned inhibitors in TMPRSS4-overexpressing SW480 cells was reported 30 .",

TMPRSS2 has been described as a mediator of ACE2-coupled endocytosis in the first SARS-CoV 35 and by previous publication also for SARS-CoV2 11 . However, we identified high levels of co-expression between ACE2 and TMPRSS4 and other members of the TMPRSS family and hypothesize that any of these additional family members might have the same function as the well described TMPRSS2. As a consequence, we propose that besides TMPRSS2 also other TMPRSS family members could be targets of pharmaceutical intervention warranting further research. After entering the cell, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is released, replicated and packaged again. Drugs can target the viral protease and the polymerase needed for replication 36 . Replication can further be inhibited by interferon and interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) 17 which we also found evidence for in negatively correlated replication pathways (e.g. DNA replication and homologous recombination). This depends on a healthy immune response and may be impaired in individuals with a weak immune system due to age or underlying diseases. The virus is packaged and released into the extracellular space where it can be attacked by macrophages chemo-attracted by CXCL17 13 . Also T-Cells can be involved in the immune response. We found evidence for their activation in GO analysis by associated interleukins IL1 and IL7. It is tempting to speculate that the severity of the clinical manifestations such as the acute respiratory failure and also failure in other organs depend on the state of the immune system which decreases with age or diseases such as diabetes. The involvement of ACE2 in the renin-angiotensin system as antagonist of ACE in regulating blood pressure via Angiotensin II, vasoconstriction, dilation and its protective role against lung injury 37 are additional factors which correlate with age. This is confirmed by reports from Wadmann et al. 38 about Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data from 14 U.S. states that 50% hospitalized COVID-19 patients had pre-existing high blood pressure 38 . In their study about ACE2 in the preceeding SARS-CoV virus Imai et al. 37 found that ACE2 protects against lung injury and acid-induced lung injury in a Ace2-knockout mouse can be improved by an inhibitor of the Angiotensin II receptor AT1 37 We conclude, that our meta-analysis of RNA-Seq data of lung cells partially infected with SARS-CoV-2 identified the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS4 as one of the most significantly correlated genes with the virus receptor ACE2. We propose that inhibitors of TMPRSS family members TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11D and TMPRSS11E besides TMPRSS2 are worthwhile testing in vitro and if that turns out to be successful and toxicity can be excluded potentially for in vivo studies. As clinicians, pathologists and scientists are struggling to get to grips with and understanding of the damage wrought by SARS-CoV-2 as it invades the body, we hope that our analyses and dataset will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis of COVID-19.",

Transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSSx mediate SARS-CoV-2 cell entry via ACE2. TMPRSS2 was reported for this in the first SARS-CoV a by previous publication also for SARS-CoV-2 but we hypothesize that due to co-expression with ACE2, TMPRSS4 and other members of the TMPRSS family may well perform this task. We sugges that inhibitors of TMPRSS4 and other TMPRSS family members might have therapeutic potential. Upon entry into the cell, viral RNA is released, replicated and packaged again. Replication can be inhibited by interferon and interferon stimulated genes (ISG) what we also saw in negatively correlat replication pathways (e.g. DNA replication and homologous recombination). This indicates a healthy immune response and may be impaired in persons with a weak immune system due to age or disease The packaged virus is released from the cell and can be attacked by macrophages chemo-attracted by CXCL17 -or T-cells for which we found evidence for by GO analysis and by associated interleukins IL1 and IL7. It is tempting to speculate that the severity of the clinical manifestations such as the acu respiratory failure and also failure in other organs depends on the quality of the immune system decreasing with age or diseases such as diabetes. The involvement of ACE2 in the renin-angiotensin system as antagonist of ACE in regulating blood pressure via Angiotensin II (Ang-II), vasoconstrictio dilation and its protective role against lung injury are additional factors which correlate with age. and gest lated thy se. by ins cute in ction,",
