            "text": "Woody plant encroachment affects grassland and savanna ecosystems worldwide, producing important changes to ecosystem structure, processes, and biodiversity (Archer 2010; Eldridge et al. 2011). Consequently, restoration strategies employ woody plant removal as a means to recover historical conditions (Whitford 2002; Archer et al. 2011). The assumption that woody plant removal has positive effects on biodiversity, however, typically goes untested. The lack of quantitative information about the effects of woody plant removal has engendered controversy regarding the value of this restoration approach, particularly when reference conditions are uncertain or when restoration of historical conditions is incomplete (Fensham 2008; Archer et al. 2011). Furthermore, existing studies suggest that species of interest can respond positively (Coppedge et al. 2004; Smyth & Haukos 2010) or negatively (Martin & McIntyre 2007; Kutt & Martin 2010; Isaacs et al. 2013) to woody plant removal, depending on species' habitat requirements and the nature of habitat change induced by woody plant removal. The varying impacts of woody plant removal on species of conservation concern underscore the need for quantitative evaluations of woody plant removal effects in different ecosystems.",

The program has united government agencies, livestock producers, and conservation groups seeking to increase the pace and scale of grassland restoration within portions of the Southwestern United States that have experienced shrub and tree encroachment over the past century. Restoration efforts within much of the Chihuahuan Desert of southwestern New Mexico employ herbicides as the primary tool for removing woody plants because current grass cover is too sparse to support the use of fire (R. Lister, personal communication).",

Grassland specialist birds are especially vulnerable to shrub encroachment and have exhibited steep regional declines in the United States (Knopf 1994; Sauer et al. 2012) as they have in other parts of the world (Sirami & Monadjem 2012). Consequently, the restoration of historical grassland or savanna vegetation structure from dense shrubland is expected to result in population increases of grassland specialists. Alternatively, if restoration treatments are incapable of restoring habitat structures and elements used by grassland specialists, their populations may not increase and the loss of shrubland specialists could lead to overall declines in biodiversity (Whitford 1997).",

First, we compared vegetation structure in three general areas: treated but formerly shrub\u2010dominated areas, untreated shrub\u2010dominated areas, and remnant grassland reference areas. Most shrub removal treatment areas were paired with untreated shrub\u2010dominated areas based on soil and landscape position. Grassland reference areas were within the study region, comparable in size and site characteristics to treatment areas, but dominated by perennial grasses. We expected treatment areas would have higher perennial grass cover and lower shrub cover than untreated areas (Perkins et al. 2006). Restoration trajectories in arid grasslands may unfold over decades (Whitford 2002), so we reasoned that older treatment areas would have higher grass cover than younger treatment areas and exhibit environmental characteristics most similar to reference grasslands. Alternatively, shrubs might reinvade old treatment areas and differences from nearby untreated, shrub\u2010dominated areas would diminish compared with young treatment areas.",

Grassland facultative species were expected to respond positively to treatment areas featuring moderate shrub cover, but would not occur in dense shrublands or reference grasslands without shrubs (Merola\u2010Zwartjes 2005).

Group 1 included perennials that are common in grassland reference states of the study region including tobosa, black grama, bush muhly, blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), side\u2010oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), and burrograss. Group 2 included perennial grasses that may increase as group 1 species decline with heavy grazing, including Sporobolus spp., Aristida spp., and purple three\u2010awn (Aristida purpurea). Group 3 consisted of grasses that are associated with high disturbance and low site productivity including fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchella) and annual grasses (Bestelmeyer et al. 2004, USDA\u2010NRCS 2012).

These results support our prediction that grassland specialists tolerant of moderate shrub cover (i.e. Cassin's sparrow and eastern meadowlark) should respond positively to treatments. Smythe and Haukos (2010) observed a similar response of Cassin's sparrows in herbicide\u2010treated sand shinnery oak (Quercus havardii) communities of Southeastern New Mexico. Also consistent with our results, Block and Morrison (2010) found that horned larks were absent in areas of moderate shrub cover and instead occurred primarily in pure grasslands where they avoided even short\u2010stature woody cover.",

The association of a shrubland specialist (black\u2010tailed gnatcatcher) with untreated areas suggests that habitat quality for these birds may be reduced by shrub removal. For some shrubland specialist species such as loggerhead shrikes and mourning doves, we did not find clear evidence of treatment effects; instead their abundance may be governed by landscape\u2010scale patterns (Gutzwiller & Barrow 2002; St\u2010Louis et al. 2010). Another shrubland specialist, the black\u2010throated sparrow, used both treated and untreated areas, perhaps reflecting the use of different habitat types for foraging or nesting, or responses to habitat elements that were unchanged by the manipulations (Table S1; Paritte 2010). To favor declining species, it may be valuable to expand representation of habitat conditions produced by shrub\u2010removal treatments. Nonetheless, preservation of shrub\u2010dominated areas is also warranted due to the positive effects of shrubs on black\u2010tailed gnatcatchers found here and on bird diversity found in other studies (Naranjo & Raitt 1993; Whitford 1997).",

Because grassland loss in the Chihuahuan Desert can be difficult or impossible to reverse (Bestelmeyer et al. 2009); however, diligent efforts must be made to preserve existing grassland states if they are to be represented at all. The current distribution of habitat types likely overrepresents shrub\u2010dominated habitat, so shrub removal treatments may help to sustain regional bird diversity by favoring some grassland specialist species. Our interpretation of shrub\u2010removal efforts for the Chihuahuan Desert contrasts with that of Kutt and Martin (2010) for north\u2010eastern Australian woodlands. These authors concluded that the majority of bird species predicted to decline with increasing vegetation density were open habitat\u2010specialists that were increasing in abundance at a national scale. In our case, however, bird species associated with open grassland habitats are declining regionally (Sauer et al. 2012). Thus, interpretations about the effects of woody plant removal on bird diversity depend strongly on regional species pools and land change history.",

Furthermore, our approach illustrates how quantitative evaluations of restoration interventions can inform cost\u2010benefit analysis for subsequent decisions (Miller & Hobbs 2007). Restoration can then be considered with regard to specific effects on both habitat attributes and ecosystem services, instead of relying on incomplete historical records and vague notions of similarity to reference conditions.Implications for Practice\nThe efficacy of woody plant removal efforts to increase biodiversity is poorly documented and controversial, so there is a clear need for regional tests of biodiversity responses.Shrub removal by herbicides in the Chihuahuan Desert favored the abundance of some grassland specialist bird species that are in regional decline. Shrub removal also reduced the abundance of a shrub specialist species.Shrub removal produced a novel ecosystem type that differed from reference grasslands and did not support other grassland specialist bird species. Thus, shrub removal should not be viewed as means to mitigate the loss of additional grasslands.Selective shrub removal combined with management to preserve unencroached grasslands may be an effective means to sustain biodiversity in semiarid grasslands.\n\n",
