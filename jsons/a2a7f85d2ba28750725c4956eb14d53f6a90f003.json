            "text": "Knowledge graphs' incompleteness has motivated many researchers to propose methods to automatically infer missing facts in knowledge graphs. Knowledge graph embedding has been an active research area for knowledge graph completion, with great improvement from the early TransE to the current state-of-the-art ConvKB. ConvKB considers a knowledge graph as a set of triples, and employs a convolutional neural network to capture global relationships and transitional characteristics between entities and relations in the knowledge graph. However, it only utilizes the triple information, and ignores the rich information contained in relation paths. In fact, a path of one relation describes the relation from some aspect in a fine-grained way. Therefore, it is beneficial to take relation paths into consideration for knowledge graph embedding. In this paper, we present a novel convolutional neural network-based embedding model PConvKB, which improves knowledge graph embedding by incorporating relation paths locally and globally. Specifically, we introduce attention mechanism to measure the local importance of relation paths. Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective measure DIPF to compute the global importance of relation paths. Experimental results show that our model achieves substantial improvements against state-of-the-art methods.",

They are important resources for many intelligence applications like question answering and web search.

The main idea of knowledge graph embedding is to embed entities and relations of a knowledge graph into a continuous vector space and predict missing facts by manipulating the entity and relation embeddings involved. Among knowledge graph embedding methods, the translation-based models are simple and efficient, also perform well. For example, given a triple (h, r, t), the most wellknown translation-based model TransE [5] models the relation r as a translation vector r connecting the embeddings h and t of the two entities, i.e., h + r \u2248 t. It performs well on simple relations, i.e., 1-to-1 relations. but poorly on complicated relations, i.e., 1-to-N, N-to-1 and N-to-N relations. To address this issue, TransH [41] , TransR [20] and TransD [14] are proposed. Unfortunately, these models are less simplicity and efficiency than TransE. Nickel et al. [26] present HolE, which uses circular correlation to combine the expressive power of the tensor product with the simplicity and efficiency of TransE.",

However, it only focuses on knowledge triples, ignoring the rich knowledge contained in relation paths. In fact, a path of one entity pair describes the relation connecting the entity pair from some aspect in a fine-grained way, and the importance of each path is different. For example, in Fig. 1 , the two paths place of birth -country and friend -nationality of entity pair (Tom Cruise, America) describes the relation nationality from the location and social way, respectively. Since the path place of birth -country is more essential than friend -nationality to express the relation nationality, thus it is more important from the local view. Moreover, from the global view the path friend -nationality also occurs in entity pair (Tom Cruise, England), which is connecting by the relation travel, thus it is less important than the path place of birth -country to express the relation nationality.",

It does not consider that the path in the set of relation paths may also occur in other entity pairs that connects by other relations. Typically, the more set of relation paths a path occurs in, the less importance the path is. Therefore, inspired by inverse document frequency [10, 16] , which is a weighting function that has been widely used for measuring how informative each word is in a set of documents. We propose the Degree-guided Inverse Path Frequency (DIPF) to model the global importance of each path in the set of relation paths. For each relation r \u2208 R in the knowledge graph G, we first find its corresponding entity pairs (h r , t r ) i , i = 1, 2, . . . , n r , where n r is the number of entity pairs connecting by the relation r. i.e.,",

For each triple in test set and validation set, we construct one negative triple by switching entities from test triples and validation triples, respectively. The triple classification decision rule is: for a triple (h, r, t), if its implausibility score is below the relationspecific threshold \u03c3 r , predict positive, otherwise negative. The relation-specific threshold \u03c3 r is determined by maximizing classification accuracy on the validation set. The triple classification accuracy is the percentage of triples in the test set that are classified correctly. Implementation Details. We use TransE to initialize entity and relation embeddings in PConvKB, select the learning rate in {5e \u22126 , 1e \u22125 , 5e \u22125 , 1e \u22124 }, the number of filters in {50, 100, 200, 400}. We set the batch size at 128 and set the L 2 -regularizer \u03bb at 0.001 in our objective function. We run PConvKB up to 150 epochs and monitor the accuracy after every 10 training epochs to choose optimal hyper-parameters. We obtain the highest accuracy on the validation set when learning rate at 5e \u22125 , the number of filters at 400 on WN18; and learning rate at 1e \u22125 , the number of filters at 50 on FB15k; and the learning rate at 5e \u22126 , the number of filters at 400 on WN18RR; and the learning rate at 1e \u22125 , the number of filters at 200 on FB15k-237.

[31] present relational graph convolutional networks for knowledge graph completion. Shi and Weninger [32] present a shared variable neural network model called ProjE, which fills-in missing facts in a knowledge graph by learning joint embeddings of entities and relations. Dettmers et al. [7] present a multi-layer convolutional network model, namely ConvE, which uses 2D convolutions over embeddings to predict missing links in knowledge graphs. Nguyen et al. [22] present a CNN-based embedding model, i.e., ConvKB. It applies CNN to explore the global relationships among same dimensional entries in each embedding triple, which generalizes the transitional characteristics in the transition-based embedding models. Nguyen et al. [23] present CapsE, which combines CNN with capsule networks [29] for knowledge graph embedding. All these models treat a knowledge graph as a collection of triples, and disregard the rich information exist in relation paths.",

In particular, we introduce attention mechanism to measure the local importance of relation paths. Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective measure DIPF to compute the global importance of relation paths. We evaluate our model on link prediction and triple classification. Experimental results show that our model achieves substantial improvements against state-of-the-art methods.",

More specifically, on FB15k-237, the accuracy of triple classification improves from 80.6% of PConvKB(locally) to 82.1% PConvKB, and 80.9% of PCon-vKB (global) to 82.1% PConvKB.
