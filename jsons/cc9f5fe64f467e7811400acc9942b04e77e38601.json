This may explain why the lesions of SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia are mainly in the subpleural areas. Because COVID-19 generally begins in the terminal alveoli, which are close to the pleura, pathologies can be clearly observed by lung ultrasound. 6 In addition, strict infection control requirements for COVID-19 patients make transport to radiology suites complex and carry high risks of severe hypoxemia.",

Compared with the B lines caused by cardiogenic pulmonary edema, the B lines here were more likely to be fused and fixed. 8 The B lines had blurred edges and no bifurcation signs. The origination point of the subpleural lesion was more obtuse (convex array probe) compared with that of B lines of pulmonary edema.

Ultrasound can evaluate the lung conditions before the surgery to decide whether a patient is optimized along with other diagnostic modalities. Pleural effusion, pneumothorax and other pathologies could be promptly managed by a chest tube if indicated. If lung consolidation exists, lung recruitment maneuvers could be attempted to improve oxygenation under ultrasound guidance. If airway obstruction is suspected, endotracheal tube suctioning or fiberoptic bronchoscopy could be performed. 1.3.2 Intraoperative & Postoperative: Lung ultrasound can help to select the best surgical position. For example, COVID-19 patients with poor oxygenation might benefit from prone position if possible, and lung ultrasound can help to monitor the status of lung status with position changes.",
