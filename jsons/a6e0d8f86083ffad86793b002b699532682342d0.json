Many of these zoonotic viruses have arisen from wildlife sources and caused neurological disease, especially those emerging during this period in the Asian and Australasian regions (Mackenzie et al. 2001 ; Mackenzie 2005 ; Griffi n 2010 ; Bale 2012 ; Wang and Crameri 2014 ) . Most of the diseases emerging from wildlife have been from bats and rodents (Enria and Pinheiro 2000 ; Calisher et al. 2006 ; Goeijenbier et al. 2013 ; Luis et al. 2013 ) . Bats are only second to rodents in terms of mammalian species richness (Wilson and Reeder 2005 ) and constitute about 20 % of all mammalian species. Thus, with their wide distribution and abundance, it is not surprising that there is growing awareness that bats are the reservoir hosts for a number of these emerging viruses (Calisher et al. 2006 ; van der Poel et al. 2006 ; Wong et al. 2007 ; Halpin et al. 2007 ; Wood et al. 2012 ; Smith and Wang 2013 ; Shi 2013 ) and suspected of being associated with many others on serological grounds. Not only have they been shown to be the reservoir hosts for rabies and related lyssaviruses but also for other human pathogens, or potential pathogens, such as SARS-coronavirus-like viruses (Lau et al. 2005 ; Li et al. 2005 ; Shi and Hu 2008 ) , Ebola and Marburg viruses (Leroy et al. 2005 ; Gonzalez et al. 2007 ; Towner et al. 2007 Towner et al. , 2009 Mar\u00ed Sa\u00e9z et al. 2014 ; Olival and Hayman 2014 ; Ogawa et al. 2015 ) , Menangle virus (Philbey et al. 1998 ) , and Hendra and Nipah viruses (Young et al. 1996 ; Halpin et al. 2000 ; Yob et al. 2001 ; Chua et al. 2002 ) .

The divergence of the Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera, irrespective of suborder status, occurred well prior to the oldest fossil record from the Eocene. Although the evolution of fl ight may have preceded echolocation, fossil remains from the Eocene indicate echolocation was well established (Simmons and Geisler 1998 ; Simmons et al. 2010 ) . Following the early evolution of fl ight and echolocation, bats have changed little as a taxonomic group relative to other mammals (Jepsen 1970 ) . Bats also have traits (e.g., fl ight, sheltered roosts and ability to hibernate and entire torpor) which may have allowed them to preferentially survive the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) extinction, occurring ~65 million years ago following the impact of the large bolide creating the 180-300-km-wide Chicxulub crater in northern Yucatan, Mexico (for more details see ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 234, "end": 256, "text": "(Teeling et al. 2005 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF345"}, {"start": 379, "end": 405, "text": "(Simmons and Conway 2003 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF319"}, {"start": 406, "end": 427, "text": "Teeling et al. 2005 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF345"}, {"start": 727, "end": 754, "text": "(Simmons and Geisler 1998 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF320"}, {"start": 755, "end": 776, "text": "Simmons et al. 2010 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF320"}, {"start": 910, "end": 924, "text": "(Jepsen 1970 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Evolution, Origin, Taxonomy , and Diversity of Order Chiroptera"}, {"text": "Bats are unique with regard to the abundance and density achieved by certain cavedwelling species.

The potential for non-bite transmission of rabies virus among bats through saliva exchanged during mutual grooming has been suggested; transmission by such a mechanism may have precipitated an epidemic of rabies among kudu ( Tragelaphus strepsiceros ), an African ungulate (Barnard et al. 1982 ) . Mexican free-tailed bats may transmit rabies virus in utero, as virus isolates have been obtained from cell lines established with fetal tissue (Steece and Calisher 1989 ) . Airborne transmission of rabies virus was suggested as the possible event leading to two cases of rabies in humans visiting a cave harboring millions Mexican free-tailed bats (Irons et al. 1957 ; Humphrey et al. 1960 ). In subsequent experiments, a number of caged animals placed within caves developed rabies, and rabies virus has been isolated from air sampled from these same caves (Constantine 1967b , c ; Winkler 1968 ) . Experimental aerosol infection of mice with RABV and EBLV-2 found that mice were highly susceptible to infection by inhalation whereas ELBV-2 required direct intranasal inoculation (Johnson et al. 2006 ) . Most recently, laboratory mice and wild-caught big brown bats ( E. fuscus ) and Mexican free-tailed bats were exposed to aerosolized rabies virus. All the bats and some of the mice survived exposure and produced rabies neutralizing antibody, but this antibody provided poor protection for the bats to a subsequent challenge with rabies virus 6 months later (Davis et al. 2007 ).

There are about 60 species in total. Flying-foxes range in body weight from 300 g to over 1 kg, and in wingspan from 600 mm to 1.7 m. They are the largest bats in the world, do not echolocate, and navigate at night by eyesight and their keen sense of smell. All species eat fruits, fl owers or pollen, and roost communally in trees. Flying foxes are nomadic species, capable of traveling distances of hundreds of kilometers. Where the distributions of different species overlap, roosts are shared (Hall and Richards 2000 ; Corbet and Hill 1992 ; Mickleburgh et al. 1992 ; Nowak 1994 ) . Thus the potential exists for interaction between fl ying fox populations across much of their global distribution. Recent reports of henipa-like virus detections in non-pteropid and in other mega bat species suggest that the bat-virus relationship may be even more ancient (Li et al. 2008 ; Croser and Marsh 2013 ) . Calisher et al. ( 2006 ) review the apparent association between bats and emerging infectious diseases. They contend that information about the natural history of most viruses in bats is limited, and specifi cally in relation to the family Pteropodidae , that only half of the 64 genera in this family (which includes fl ying foxes) have been adequately studied. Thus we know relatively little about the bats from which the henipaviruses have emerged. Calisher et al. ( 2006 ) pose a number of questions in relation to the role of bats and emerging zoonoses. Do bats possess special attributes that equip them to host highly pathogenic zoonoses? Are emergences such as Hendra and Nipah viruses infrequent and incidental events, or are we detecting only the tip of the iceberg? They conclude by calling for pre-emptive potential pathogen screening in wildlife, rather than the outbreak-response surveillance that typically occurs currently.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 95, "end": 115, "text": "(Field et al. 2007 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 967, "end": 992, "text": "(Hall and Richards 2000 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 993, "end": 1015, "text": "Corbet and Hill 1992 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1041, "text": "Mickleburgh et al. 1992 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF244"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1054, "text": "Nowak 1994 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF262"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1348, "text": "(Li et al. 2008 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF199"}, {"start": 1349, "end": 1372, "text": "Croser and Marsh 2013 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1399, "text": "Calisher et al.

Common features are initial depression, inappetence, and fever, rapidly progressing to fulminating neurologic and/or respiratory disease (Biosecurity Queensland 2014 ).

Observations of clinical cases suggested a varying presentation in different classes of animals. Affected weaners and porkers (2-6 months) typically showed acute febrile illness with respiratory signs ranging from rapid and labored breathing to harsh nonproductive cough. Attributed neurological signs included trembling, twitching, muscular spasms, rear leg weakness and variable lameness or spastic paresis.

Neurological signs including agitation and head pressing, tetanus-like spasms and seizures, Nystagmus, champing of mouth, and apparent pharyngeal muscle paralysis were observed. The primary means of spread between farms and between regions was the movement of pigs. The primary mode of transmission on-farm was likely oro-nasal.

Evidence of infection (virus isolation, immunohistochemistry, serology) and neurologic disease was found in dogs and horses in the outbreak area (Nor et al. 2000 ) .

Clinical presentation of Nipah virus cases is given in more detail in section \"Henipaviruses,\" and only briefl y described below. Most patients presented with acute encephalitis characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, disorientation, dizziness, vomiting and more than 50 % had a reduced level of consciousness (Chua et al. 1999 ; Goh et al. 2000 ) .

Recently, the detection of a MERS-CoV conspecifi c virus from an African bat led the authors to hypothesize that the MERS-CoV may have originated from an African bat, followed by bat to camel transmission in Africa, then the introduction of MERS-CoV to Middle East through camel exportation/importation Chan et al. 2015 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 115, "end": 138, "text": "(Albarrak et al. 2012 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 139, "end": 161, "text": "Buchholz et al. 2013 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 307, "end": 330, "text": "(Alagaili et al. 2014 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 331, "end": 357, "text": "Alexandersen et al. 2014 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 358, "end": 378, "text": "Hemida et al. 2013 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 379, "end": 405, "text": "Reusken et al. 2013a , b )", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 515, "end": 535, "text": "(Azhar et al. 2014 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 536, "end": 556, "text": "Memish et al. 2014 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF238"}, {"start": 702, "end": 722, "text": "(Azhar et al. 2014 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 893, "end": 916, "text": "(Alagaili et al. 2014 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 917, "end": 943, "text": "Alexandersen et al. 2014 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 944, "end": 963, "text": "Meyer et al. 2014 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF243"}, {"start": 964, "end": 984, "text": "Perera et al. 2013 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF272"}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1308, "text": "Chan et al. 2015 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Coronaviruses"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Salivary excretion of rabies virus by healthy vampire bats", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Aguilar-Seti\u00e9n", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "Loza-Rubio", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Salas-Rojas", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "Epidemiol Infect", "volume": "133", "issn": "", "pages": "517--522", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Dengue virus in Mexican bats", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Aguilar-Seti\u00e9n", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Romero-Almaraz", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "S\u00e1nchez-Hern\u00e1ndez", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2008, "venue": "Epidemiol Infect", "volume": "136", "issn": "", "pages": "1678--1683", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["N"], "last": "Alagaili", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Briese", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Mishra", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2014, "venue": "mBio", "volume": "5", "issn": "", "pages": "884--00814", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Recovery from severe novel coronavirus infection", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Albarrak", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Stephens", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Hewson", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2012, "venue": "Saudi Med J", "volume": "33", "issn": "", "pages": "1265--1269", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus antibody reactors among camels in Dubai", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Alexandersen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["P"], "last": "Kobinger", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Soule", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "Transbound Emerg Dis", "volume": "61", "issn": "", "pages": "105--108", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Studies of arthropod-borne virus infections in Chiroptera. 8.
