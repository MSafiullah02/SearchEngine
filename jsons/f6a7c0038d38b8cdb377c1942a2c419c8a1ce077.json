We evaluated outcomes of high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) in 56 pediatric lymphoma patients. Patients received nitrosourea (51 BCNU; 5 ACNU), etoposide, and cyclophosphamide (BEC; AEC). Median age at HDC/auto-SCT was 12 years (range 2-17 years). Forty-four patients underwent HDC/auto-SCT because they did not achieve complete remission after induction chemotherapy. Eight patients showed relapse and four NK/T-cell lymphoma patients also underwent HDC/auto-SCT. BCNU pneumonitis was diagnosed in nine (16.0%) patients. Eight (14.3%) relapsed after HDC/auto-SCT. Treatment-related mortality occurred in three cases. Five-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were 74.8% [72.7% non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); 83.3% Hodgkin's disease (HD); 72.7%] and 83.6% (81.6% NHL; 91.7% HD), respectively. HDC/auto-SCT with BEC or AEC regimen for pediatric high-risk lymphoma patients showed feasible outcomes. However, treatment modifications are warranted to reduce relapse and toxicity.",

Recent studies have shown long-term EFS rates of over 80% in pediatric patients with HD [7] . These results have been achieved through collaboration study and risk stratification strategy [8, 9] . Previous studies have reported that an early response to chemotherapy is one of the prognostic markers of B-cell NHL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia [10] . However, the prognosis for children with relapsed or refractory HD and NHL is poor with the current intensive regimens [11] . NKTL is a rare subtype of pediatric NHL and is known to have a highly aggressive clinical course. However, as data for pediatric NKTL are limited, no optimal treatment is available [12, 13] . Highdose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) have been used to improve outcomes for lymphoma patients with poor prognosis. Therefore, we used HDC/auto-SCT in pediatric lymphoma patients who achieved partial response (PR) after induction chemotherapy, NKTL patients, and patients showing recurrence after conventional chemotherapy.",

Most patients (85.7%) included had advanced stage (stage III or IV) disease. Response to chemotherapy is one of the most important prognostic factors; minimal disseminated disease after chemotherapy may have a prognostic role in pediatric lymphoma [26] [27] [28] . Here, we aimed to improve treatment outcomes in patients having residual disease after receiving induction chemotherapy, patients with NTKL, and patients with recurrent disease using HDC/auto-SCT. Consequently, patients showing different indications for HDC/auto-SCT showed 5-year EFS values of 50.0-83.3% and 5-year OS values of 75.0-86.1%. In the previous studies, the 3-or 5-year EFS rate was reported to be 53-66% in relapsed/refractory pediatric lymphoma patients who received HDC/auto-SCT [15, 29] . Our study showed a promising outcome of 83.3% EFS rate in relapsed pediatric lymphoma patients, although there is a limitation of small number of patients. However, recurrence was a major cause of treatment failure and patients who showed relapse after HDC/auto-SCT had dismal outcomes. Eight of 56 patients showed relapse after HDC/auto-SCT and only two patients were alive without any evidence of disease. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to determine predictive factors for relapse. In multivariate analyses, patients having PR before HDC/auto-SCT had a higher risk of relapse (relative risk 4.85; 95% confidence interval 1.03-22.78) than patients having CR before HDC/auto-SCT. Sex, age, histological type (HD or NHL), and indication for HDC/auto-SCT were not associated with recurrence, but further analysis is needed in a large patient group.",

Fanin et al. emphasized that HDC/auto-SCT consolidated the response to chemotherapy in patients who were transplanted in CR or PR, but did not change the response in refractory/resistant or relapsed cases [37] . In our study, HDC/auto-SCT was performed in two ALCL patients who had PR before transplantation, one of whom showed relapse and died while the other lived with no evidence of disease. Recently, anti-CD30 monoclonal antibodies such as brentuximab and anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors such as crizotinib have shown promising results in refractory ALCL [38, 39] . Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of autologous or allogeneic SCT and new drug combinations in patients with a high risk of relapse. Among HD patients, two patients with stage IV disease showed recurrence, of which one patient recovered after haploidentical PBSCT; however, the other patient died of disease progression although he underwent unrelated PBSCT. Several studies have reported the benefits of allogeneic SCT in patients showing recurrence after HDC/auto-SCT [40] . After a phase 3 study, brentuximab was approved for maintenance therapy after HDC/auto-SCT in patients with a high risk of relapse or progression [41] . Pembrolizumab showed a response rate of 69% in relapsed or refractory HD patients, most of whom had undergone HDC/auto-SCT and then received brentuximab therapy [42] . However, studies including pediatric patients and involving this new treatment paradigm are still lacking and data on long-term follow-up and comparison between allogeneic and autologous SCT are needed.",

            "text": "Nitrosourea can cause severe pulmonary toxicity [43] . The total BCNU dose of 450 mg/m 2 in BEC conditioning regimen was known to be the upper limit dose to minimize pulmonary toxicity, thus we used a total dose of 450 mg/m 2 ACNU or BCNU [44, 45] . However, patients who received this total dose developed pulmonary toxicity; the crude incidence of drug-induced pneumonitis was 16% in our center. Richard et al. reported that the BCNU dose of 300 mg/m 2 in BEC conditioning regimen was well tolerated and was not associated with any reduction in efficacy [15] . Lane et al. reported that pneumonitis is a significant cause of death in patients who received BCNU, and furthermore prior mediastinal radiation therapy is a risk factor of pneumonitis [46] . In our study, we did not find a relationship between pneumonitis and prior exposure to bleomycin or rituximab, or chest or craniospinal irradiation before HDC/auto-SCT because the number of patients in each group was small. The pathogenesis of BCNU pneumonitis has not yet been elucidated. As seen in this study, it is difficult to predict the development of BCNU pneumonitis based on the BCNU dose, prior mediastinal radiation therapy, and so on. BCNU pneumonitis tends to be self-limiting in most patients, but it is important to note that it may result in mortality in rare cases. Although it has been known that BCNU can cause pulmonary toxicity, there have been no previous reports of ACNU increasing the risk of pulmonary VOD as far as we know. However, more attention should be paid to pulmonary VOD when administering high-dose ACNU. This study has limitations. This is a retrospective study and patients who received HDC and underwent auto-SCT were analyzed. It covers various subtypes of lymphomas, so it is difficult to assess the role of HDC/auto-SCT in treating NKTL patients, who were few. However, the study's strength is that all patients were administered the same conditioning regimen for long-term periods.",

However, efforts to reduce TRM, strategies to reduce recurrence after HDC/auto-SCT, and close monitoring of long-term complications such as secondary malignancies are needed. Furthermore, novel treatment strategies are required to overcome poor outcomes in patients who show relapse after auto-SCT. Further studies and new strategies such as allogeneic SCT, upfront target therapy, and immunotherapy are needed to improve survival rates in high-risk lymphoma patients.",
