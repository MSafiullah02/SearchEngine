They are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in infants, children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients. The disease severity varies according to the host and viral predisposing factors, such as affecting age, immune status of patient, combined infection and infection mechanism of viral pathogen 1, 2. Respiratory infections caused by virus or bacteria are often indistinguishable, and rapid and accurate detection is crucial for appropriate patient treatment and prevention of endemic spread; therefore, selecting an appropriate diagnostic test is indispensable 3. The common respiratory viruses causing respiratory infections include adenovirus (AdV), coronaviruses (CoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza virus type A and B, parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV 1), PIV 2, PIV 3, respiratory syncytial virus type A (RSV A), RSV B, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses and bocaviruses 4, 5, 6.",

Recently, rapid antigen tests are used widely in clinical laboratories, but they are known to be less sensitive and less specific for the detection of respiratory viruses 8, 9. Molecular assay, especially polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is increasingly used for the diagnosis of viral infections. PCR is more sensitive and rapid, can be largely automated, and can detect and quantify viruses not amenable to routine cultures 9, 10. Moreover, a simultaneous detection of several viruses using multiplex PCR assay is advantageous to differentiate diagnosis of viral respiratory infections in one assay and facilitate cost\u2010effectiveness in the clinical field 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13.",
