Here, we present a framework for monitoring COVID-19 hospitalization data to project risks and trigger shelter-in-place orders to prevent overwhelming healthcare surges while minimizing the duration of costly lockdowns. Assuming the relaxation of social distancing increases the risk of infection ten-fold, the optimal strategy for Austin, Texas-the fastest-growing large city in the US-will trigger a total of 135 [90% prediction interval: 126-141] days of sheltering, allow schools to open in the fall, and result in an expected 2929 deaths [90% prediction interval: 2837-3026] by September 2021, which is 29% the annual mortality rate. In the months ahead, policy makers are likely to face difficult choices and the extent of public restraint and cocooning of vulnerable populations may save or cost thousands of lives.",

Three weeks later, a second order was issued, requiring cloth face coverings in public spaces. Under mounting pressures to relieve the economic and societal stresses of shelter-in-place orders, the US White House and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued Opening Up America Again on April 16, 2020, which is a three-phased plan for relaxing such restrictions around the country (3). Texas followed suit, declaring that the state would begin returning to work, entertainment and commerce on May 1, 2020 (4).",

Measures such as closures of schools and non-essential businesses, prohibitions on public gatherings, requiring social distancing, restricting travel, along with ordering face covering, frequent hand washing, surface cleaning, and staying at home when sick, can reduce both the frequency and risks of contacts between susceptible and infected people. During the early months of the 1918 influenza pandemicthe only comparably severe pandemic in recent history-aggressive social distancing proved critical to reducing mortality in the US (5) . Despite the life-saving potential of social distancing measures (6, 7), they are controversial (8) given their potentially large economic (9), societal, and mental health (10) costs. Two recent studies have projected pandemic resurgence if social distancing measures are relaxed prematurely (11, 12) , and others recommend the gradual relaxation of social distancing measures only when hospitals are no longer overburdened to balance expected public health risks and economic strain (13) (14) (15) .",

First, we present a conceptual and quantitative framework that clarifies COVID-19 policy options for mitigating risk in the wake of the first pandemic wave. Second, we apply the framework to derive optimal triggers for initiating and relaxing shelter-in-place orders to minimize the number of days of costly social distancing while ensuring that COVID-19 hospitalizations do not exceed local capacity. Finally, we demonstrate the 2 incontrovertible importance of sheltering vulnerable populations to reduce the burden of COVID- 19 . The impact of future social distancing policies will depend on public adherence, which is highly unpredictable. There are roughly two possible futures. In the first future, the pandemic is held at bay through a combination of public willingness to sustain extreme social distancing despite its costs and a ramping up of testing, contact tracing and isolation to rapidly contain emerging clusters. In the other future, a relaxation in social distancing or insufficient containment resources allow a second pandemic wave to emerge. For a policy maker facing the latter scenario, either intentionally or unintentionally, our framework provides guidance for enacting short-term lockdowns based on trends in local hospitalization data to avert unmanageable hospital surges while minimizing social and economic disruption.",

We project pandemic hospitalizations under various intervention scenarios through September 2021. Schools are assumed to remain closed from March 14 until August 18, 2020. After that, they can be reopened or closed in tandem with shelter-in-place orders (16) . After May 1, we assume that the city is either in a relaxed state in which the transmission rate is partially but not fully reduced by limited measures and efforts to test, trace and isolate cases, or a lock-down state in which renewed shelter-in-place orders reduce transmission by 90% relative to baseline. We find simple triggers for issuing sheltering orders and estimate the impact of cocooning vulnerable populations, that is, maintaining a 95% reduction in transmission 3 to high-risk individuals. These findings provide actionable insights for other metropolitan areas where shelter-in-place orders have curbed the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the framework can incorporate any dynamic model of COVID-19 transmission to support similar planning throughout the US.",

Based on our decision-support efforts for the city of Austin and potential biases in confirmed case count data across the US, we conjecture that local hospitalization data will be a more reliable indicator of transmission intensity and future hospital surges. Our best policies track daily COVID-19 hospital admissions and daily total hospitalizations across the city and trigger the initiation and relaxation of lock-down periods when admissions cross predetermined thresholds.",

The simultaneous release of the lock-down and start of a delayed 2020-2021 school year would fuel a third wave, which would be expected to be self-limiting, that is, subside without requiring a third lock-down period.

Thus, modelers can broadly apply this framework to provide decision-support for COVID-19 responses in cities worldwide. In addition to tracking hospitalizations for triggering shelter-in-place orders, modelers will need to regularly estimate local transmission rates as policies and individual behavior evolve. Although daily COVID-19 hospitalization counts allow robust estimation of reductions in transmission (16) , the signal is delayed by the roughly 10-day lag between infection and hospitalization. Integrating cell phone mobility data reflecting social distancing, as we do in our forecasting model (19, 20) , may improve the accuracy and timeliness of our estimates. Finally, September 2021 is a long horizon. In the months ahead, the likelihood and timeline for promising antiviral drugs and vaccines may become clearer.

The rule is based on an approximation, which holds in steady state under independent and exponentially distributed interarrival times and service times, and the approximation is increasingly accurate as \u03bb grows large. The value of parameter k determines the model's probability that an arriving patient does not have to wait for a hospital bed, and we use k = 4, which corresponds to a probability of over 0.99997 for a single patient.

We seek a simpler policy, and so we restrict attention to policies with lock-down thresholds, l t , that can change only once during the planning horizon. This class of thresholds can be characterized with three parameters: (i) the threshold value up until the change, (ii) the threshold value after the change, and (iii) the timing of the change. In addition, in our implementation we required a single safety threshold r = r t for the entire horizon. The deterministic model (3) can be formulated as a nonlinear mixed-integer program, and model (4) is a stochastic nonlinear mixed-integer program. In its general form, even the deterministic model is challenging to solve with commercial solvers, in part, because of the bilinear terms involving products of continuous variables that appear in constraint (1h).

Using such restricted classes of thresholds provides policies that are both simple to implement and simple to optimize via simulation for all configurations on a discretized grid.

For easy reference, Figure S1a repeats the results for the optimized two-level trigger for the baseline analysis; i.e., we assume 95% effective cocooning, and we toggle between 90% SD (lock-down) and 40% SD (relaxation). The daily hospitalization thresholds, and the timing of the transition, are optimized using model (4) . We fix the safety trigger that prevents premature relaxation at 60% of hospital capacity. Part (b) of Figure S1 repeats this optimization, but instead restricts solutions to a constant rather than two-level threshold. Parts (c) and (d) show the results of stress tests, in which we assess the performance of the optimal strategies shown in parts (a) and (b) when relaxed social distancing reduces transmission by only 20% rather than 40%. Under the two-level trigger, the point forecast remains under hospital capacity but the distributional forecasts suggest a significant probability that hospitals will be at, or just beyond, capacity at the peak in July. Under the constant trigger, even the point forecast \"mildly\" exceeds hospital capacity. Figure S2 performs an analogous stress test with respect to cocooning. First, we optimize for our baseline 90%-40% SD toggle, under the assumption that cocooning is 95% effective (as in Figure S1a ). Then, we evaluate the performance under the assumption that cocooning is only 80% (rather than 95%) effective. Whereas our optimal policy is robust to variation in the overall efficacy of social distancing ( Figure S1 ), it is highly sensitive to the efficacy of cocooning. This slight reduction in cocooning is expected to lead to catastrophic surges in hospitalizations, with capacity grossly exceeded in the summer and early fall of 2020. This reinforces one of our primary conclusions, that vigilant cocooning of vulnerable populations will be critical to preventing overwhelming healthcare surges and saving lives.",
