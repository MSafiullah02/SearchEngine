            "text": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of subtype H5 are a major threat for poultry holdings worldwide, here especially the zoonotic Asian H5N1 viruses. These HPAIVs have caused more than 500 fatal spillover infections from poultry to humans, with a looming danger of a new pandemic by establishing human-to-human transmissions. Besides culling measures in infected farms in endemic areas, vaccination is the major tool against HPAIV. However, the mainly used inactivated preparations have several limitations, like application to the individual animal by injection and a reduced efficiency. Here we present a modified live influenza vaccine prototype, which is based on the H17N10 bat influenza virus. The new chimeric vaccine strain R65 mono /H17N10 was able to provide full protection against a lethal challenge infection with HPAIV H5N1 of juvenile and subadult chickens, as well as ferrets after oronasal immunization. In addition, the H5 vaccine prototype cannot reassort with avian influenza viruses and therefore is a promising tool against HPAIV H5 infection, allowing new vaccination strategies for efficient disease control.",

The causative agent is influenza A virus (IAV), which is an orthomyxovirus with eight negative-sense singlestranded RNA genome segments, coding for at least 13 proteins 2 . On the basis of the cross-reactivity of antibodies (Ab) specific for the IAV membrane glycoproteins hemagglutinin (H1-18) and neuraminidase (N1-11), the viruses are classified in different subtypes. Owing to their genetic and phylogenetic divergence, the bat-specific H17N10 and H18N11 constitute a special group within the influenza A genus, leading to the term \"influenza A-like virus\" 3, 4 . These differences include an incompatibility of the bat influenza package sequences (PS) with conventional IAVs 5 .",

In 1997, the first HPAIV H5N1 virus emerged and, besides poultry, infected humans including fatal cases 7 . The original H5N1 viruses have further diversified over the time, and new viruses have emerged by replacing the N1 encoding gene segment via reassortment with N2, N3, N5, N6, N8, or N9 gene segments 8 . Between January 2013 and August 2018, several HPAIV subtypes caused the loss of 122 million domestic birds globally, with H5N1 having a big share 9 . As HPAIV now is endemic in many countries 10, 11 , causing considerable economic damage, the risk of zoonotic spillover events is eminent 12, 13 .",

            "text": "In most countries, the main strategy to control AI in poultry relies on prevention by strict biosecurity measures, and in the case of outbreaks, the implementation of restriction areas and depopulation of affected farms 11 . In comparison to the economic losses caused by these measures 9 , effective vaccination could help to prevent disease spread and further zoonotic spillover infections 14 . Countries where HPAIV is endemic like China, Egypt, or Indonesia already have used inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) or vector vaccines, mostly in case of emergency response 10 . A recent and successful example is the vaccination campaign against the H7N9 HPAIV which emerged in China in 2017 15, 16 . The mass vaccination of poultry in China, using a recombinant bivalent H5/H7 IIV, led to a marked drop in human spillover infections from 1567 cases (615 fatal) in the season 2016/2017 to only three reported cases in the season 2017/2018 14 . However, there are experiments which indicate that influenza live vaccines can \"elicit higher levels of innate responses, mucosal IgA antibodies, and heterologous protection in 1-day-old chickens compared to IIV\" 17 . Modified live influenza vaccines (MLIV) are able to induce a broad humoral (systemic and mucosal) and cellular immune response. Mimicking a natural infection and stimulating the immune system more broadly is advantageous for MLIVs 17, 18 . The avian IIVs Ab response is mainly based on a systemic IgY, the avian counterpart to mammalian IgG, whereas MLIVs induce also mucosal IgA secretion in the upper respiratory tract contributing to their efficiency 18 . A major advantage of MLIVs is the possibility of oral application, which allows easy mass vaccination as done for other live vaccines, e.g. against Newcastle disease 19, 20 . The current MLIVs are based on apathogenic influenza viruses, and attenuation is, e.g. achieved by using truncated NS1 proteins 21 or restricted replication capacities due to cold-adaptation 22 or the introduction of elastasespecific cleavage sites into the HA precursor protein 23 . Although cold-adapted MLIVs have been licensed for several years for use in humans, there are no MLIVs licensed for poultry yet, and only two types of vector-based live vaccines are on the market 18 . These vectorbased vaccines could induce a broader protection than IIVs, but it is still difficult to express more than the HA protein in the vector backbone, as it is known that also the neuraminidase (NA), the matrix protein (M2), and the nucleoprotein (NP) are beneficial for a broader and more effective immunity 24 . In addition, preexisting immunity to the used vector viruses limits the efficacy of these vaccines 17 . Of course, apathogenicity and efficacy of MLIVs in day-old chicks is an issue 17, 25 , mainly due to their immature immune system 26, 27 . However, early immunization enhances the chances to prevent an infection. Therefore, vaccination of day-old chicks is a very interesting application, and it has been shown that MLIVs are more effective than IIVs for the immunization of young individuals 17, 28 .",

The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) does not recommend the use of influenza live vaccines due to the risk of reassortment 29 . There are different research attempts to generate reassortment incompatible vaccines: Chimeric influenza B viruses (IBV) were constructed, which carry the HA segment of IAVs with IBV packaging sequences (PS) and therefore do not reassort with IAVs 30 . These chimeric viruses efficiently protected mice against lethal IAV infection 30 . In a second approach the PS were switched between the HA and the non-structural protein (NS) gene segment; preventing reassortment of these segments 31 . None of these approaches has been tested in poultry or ferrets so far. Chickens are used by default for pathogenicity and vaccine efficacy studies for poultry 32 .

Of note, the R65 mono /H17N10 MLIV used for these studies was passaged several times in chicken eggs and day-old-chicks and thereby acquired three additional mutations in HA (A201E, V273A and G339R) and one in M1 (D156N), which might reflect an adaptation to avian cells.

However, the naive chickens serving as positive controls demonstrated slightly higher viral RNA loads than vaccinated individuals did (Fig. 3c ). On dpc2, only 2 out of 9 juveniles showed very weak-positive Cq values (34.2 and 37.7), whereas all others, including the sentinels (Fig. 3d) , scored negative.

Three and four days post CI, individual animals of both groups displayed weak-positive RNA loads (>33.3) until all samples tested negative from 5 dpc onward (Fig. 3c ). Viral organ loads following CI can indicate ongoing but unrecognized infections. Animals were killed dpc7, and conchae tissue, brain, heart, and lung samples were taken individually.

Conchae samples exhibited viral RNA in two samples from subadult chicken, and in one sample from the juvenile group (Fig. 3e) .

In addition, all contact animals scored negative (Fig. 4d) . The examination of several respiratory and neuronal organ samples from the necropsy 6 days post CI revealed no positive tissues from both immunized and sentinel animals (Fig. 4e , f). In contrast, cerebrum, conchae, lung, and trachea tissue sampled from the killed positive control animal tested HPAIV positive (Fig. 4e ). In addition, the lung tissue sample of the second positive control animal scored positive with a Cq value of 30.6 at dpc6 (Fig. 4e ). In summary, shedding, replication, and systemic infection of HPAIV following CI was prevented successfully by immunization with vaccine candidate R65 mono /H17N10 in ferrets.",

Ferrets were confirmed to be seronegative for IAV antibodies at d0, using a NP-specific ELISA test (Fig. 6a, b) . Ten days after PI (d10), all vaccinated ferrets displayed a statistically significant (p-value < 0.0001) seroconversion (Fig. 6a) . The level of NP-specific Ab remained stable also 12 days after BI (d22) and 6 days after CI (dpc6). Interestingly, one sentinel ferret tested seropositive at d22 and the following time points, whereas for the other two, the S/N value noticeable decrease (Fig. 6b) . The H5-response of vaccinated ferrets was significantly boosted (p-value 0.0003) following BI, leading to seroconversion on d22 (Fig. 6c) . The CI did not further affect the H5-specific antibody levels of the vaccinated animals. Although all sentinels were still seronegative 10 days after PI, one animal was tested positive animal 12 days after BI (d22), and two contact ferrets were positive 6 days post CI (dpc6). The H5-specific antibody response of the ferrets compared with the NP-specific response exhibited a delayed phenotype. These results indicate that R65 mono /H17N10 is able to induce a pronounced NP-specific immune response ten days after the first mucosal immunization in ferrets, whereas the H5-specific response was delayed reaching comparable levels only following boost immunization (Fig. 6c) . Transmission of the R65 mono /H17N10 vaccine virus from vaccinated to sentinel animals was demonstrated by the fact that one sentinel was seropositive for NP-and H5-Ab 8 days after BI (d22) (Fig. 6b, d) .",

Just recently, the poor adaptation of the H17N10 backbone, here with H9N2 glycoproteins, to the avian system was shown 38 . This underpins our results of no transmission to direct contact chickens. Generally, restoration of pathogenicity of the attenuated vaccine strain back to the pathogenic phenotype is an important distress of MLIV 39 . Shown by the shedding data and confirmed by constantly seronegative direct contact animals, the R65 mono / H17N10 strain could be designated as strongly attenuated in chickens already, making further transmission respective restoration of pathogenicity highly unlikely.",

The apathogenicity of R65 mono /H17N10 based on the lack of clinical signs or elevated body temperature was also documented for ferrets following a prime-boost immunization scheme with a short interval. Contrasting the results from chickens, the riMLIV in ferrets was transmitted to direct contact animals.

In addition, three out of four sentinels tested positive for neutralizing Ab before challenge infection. Therefore, replication and transmission of the vaccine virus prototype from the ferret upper respiratory tract is obviously possible. These results indicate that the chimeric strain R65 mono /H17N10 is, probably due to the Fig. 6 Humoral immune response to R65 mono /H17N10 immunization and subsequent challenge infection in ferrets. Serum samples were taken from all animals on d0, d10, d22, and 6 days post challenge (dpc6 = d28), and evaluated by a competitive Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) specific for nucleoprotein (NP) (a, b) or hemagglutinin H5 binding antibodies (c, d).

However, after challenge infection none of the nasal washing samples of the vaccinated ferrets tested positive nor did any of the organ samples taken at dpc6. The prime-boost application of riMLIV to ferrets therefore also induced a sterile immunity against a homologous challenge infection, and a good immunity could be expected even after a single shot application, while cross-protection potential does not seem to be exceptional, as shown for H5N8 by in vitro crossreactivity studies. The analysis of serum samples using commercial ELISA systems, one detecting antibodies specific for the (avian origin) H5 protein as well as one assay detecting antibodies directed against conserved epitopes of NP, was in principle feasible. Nevertheless, by comparing the ELISA data to the results from VN-and HI-test it becomes clear, that some sera appearing below threshold in the ELISA are positive in the VN-and/or HI-test. These differences might be caused by a reduced overall sensitivity of the NP-ELISA for the distantly related NP protein of H17N10, or a limited replication of the chimeric virus in chicken resulting in the induction of higher levels of HA-than NP-specific antibodies. The latter is supported by the stronger NP-reaction in the ferret experiment where the more efficient replication induced a more pronounced NP-specific response.",

A likely explanation is the reduced replication of the H17N10 backbone within the avian system. Although the vaccine was passaged several times in embryonated chicken eggs and day-old-chicks, the adaptation of the virus to avian cells is still limited as also demonstrated by the minor oropharyngeal secretion. Thus, serological responses appear less well pronounced. In contrast, the serological response in ferrets was prominent, with high levels of NP-specific and increased H5-specific Ab in the aftermath of PI.

It is known that live influenza vaccines can induce protection by induction of mucosal IgA after local application, and CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses 44 . Furthermore, T cell subsets and IgA, IgM, and IgG have been shown to be located at the mucosal surface within the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) of chickens 45 . Therefore, the level of protection cannot directly be correlated to the humoral antibody titers 17,46 after immunization with modified live virus vaccines. This is in contrast to IIVs, where protection was mediated by the humoral response only 17, 47 . In addition, day-old chicks do not produce sufficient amounts of antibodies until the age of 7 days 26, 27 . The sterile protection in chicks resulting from the riMLIV prototype is particularly impressive knowing these limitations. In this context, further investigations on non-humoral immunity are necessary. Finally, we cannot formerly exclude that antiviral immune responses contributed to the protective effect of vaccination, however, the challenge infection here was always several weeks after the first vaccination and several days after booster immunization. Such innate immune responses are rather short-lived antiviral countermeasures of the host, which might not act at later time points.",
