            "text": "Mathematical modeling of the UV disinfection process provides a basis for sizing ultraviolet disinfection equipment and for interpreting test results. It also allows for adaptation of UV systems to specific disinfection processes and for the disinfection of specific microorganisms. Disinfection is generally modeled in terms of the survival, or its converse the inactivation rate, and may be rendered as a fraction or a percentage. Disinfection is invariably a logarithmic process, as is microbial growth. The disinfection rate of the microorganisms varies widely and is subject to many complexities, including shoulder effects, second stage decay, relative humidity effects, and photoreactivation. Not all these processes need be considered for every design application, but a familiarity with these effects is essential for understanding UV disinfection. Furthermore, not all of these processes can be completely and accurately modeled at present, but enough is known to adequately design reliable UV disinfection systems. All of these processes can be modeled with basic exponential equations and by using computational methods if necessary. For more detailed background information on theoretical decay models for general disinfection purposes see Kowalski (2006) , Chick et al. (1963 ), or Hiatt (1964 .",

The fact that both types of irradiance have the units of W/m 2 is an artifact of the method of measurement -in reality both the irradiation field and the microbial mass absorbing the dose exist in a volume and the irradiance should more properly have units of W/m 3 , and the proper units for UV rate constants would then be m 3 /J.",

If the irradiance forms a contour across a surface, such as a wall, floor, or cooling coil, then the surface can be subdivided and the total UV dose can be summed per unit area to get an areaweighted average dose. Since the irradiance field of a UV lamp on a surface can be subject to exponential variations, in which the near-field has a wide range of irradiance while the far field becomes relatively constant, it is often necessary to either use a very fine grid (i.e. 50 \u00d7 50 or 100 \u00d7 100) or to arrange the grid logarithmically so as to concentrate more gridlines in near-field areas of great variation.",

When the exposure dose is sufficient to cause several logs of reduction (i.e. 99% disinfection or higher) in the microbial population, the surviving population is often an order of magnitude more resistant to UV. That is, the UV rate constant for the resistant population may be ten times lower than for the first stage. This effect will, of course, only be apparent if the disinfection rate is very high, sometime as much as six logs of disinfection. In effect, most microbial populations behave as if two separate populations were presentone relatively susceptible and one relatively resistant. The first stage of decay (fast decay) will then be defined by the susceptible portion of the population and the second stage of decay (slow decay) will be defined by the resistant population. Since the resistant fraction is often on the order of about 1% or less, the second stage only becomes manifest at about the D 99 value or higher.

Note that the point at which the second stage intercepts the y-axis is equivalent to the resistant fraction f. When actual data is plotted and separated, the second stage can be extrapolated to the y-axis to determine the resistant fraction f. The slope of the two stages can be estimated by dividing the decay curve into two separate sections and computing each per Eq. (3.2). The complete two stage curve can then be developed by incorporating the k values into Eq. (3.3) and adjusting k 1 and k 2 to fit the data by trial and error (and to minimize the R 2 value).

Shoulder curves start out with a horizontal slope before developing into full exponential decay. The lag in response to the stimulus implies that either a threshold dose is necessary before measurable effects occur or that that repair mechanisms actively deal with low-level damage at low doses (Casarett 1968) . Once the threshold is passed the exponential decay curve becomes fully developed (as a single stage or two stage curve). The effect is species dependent and also appears to be a function of the intensity of irradiation. In many cases it can be neglected, especially for susceptible microbes or for high doses. However, for low irradiance levels and for spores and certain resistant bacteria the shoulder can be significant and prolonged. There are at least two separate mathematical models that can deal with shoulder effects -the classic model, and the multihit target model (Kowalski et al. 2000) . Various similar target models have been proposed, including recovery models, split-dose recovery models, and empirical models (Russell 1982 , Harm 1980 , Casarett 1968 ), but the multihit model, is the most convenient approach for most applications and it is the one addressed here.

In fact, these differences may be barely beyond the testing accuracy in most cases and therefore the conclusion that virus sensitivity decreases as RH increases must be considered a tenuous one until such time as more definitive data is accumulated on a larger number of viruses. Although DNA viruses go though a conformational change from the A form to the B form as RH increases, RNA viruses may not. RNA viruses are typically in the A conformation and if the conformation change is entirely responsible for RH effect, it could be expected that RNA viruses would not respond to RH changes. There is, however, a possible secondary effect from RHincreased bonding of water to the virus may increases the effective diameter and causes more UV scattering. Table 3 .3 shows two complete RNA virus test results but they are hardly conclusive. Figure 3 .5 illustrates the results of Table 3 .3 where it can be observed that, except for Vaccinia, the UV susceptibilities show barely any significant response to increased RH.

In an air handling unit however, the RH could vary greatly depending on where the UVGI system was located (i.e. upstream or downstream of the cooling coils). Obviously, the nature of the RH effect on UV susceptibility may dictate the preferred location of any installed UVGI system, and may even allow a means of boosting UVGI efficiency through RH control, but further quantitative results on RH effects are needed. Table 3 .4 summarizes the 13 complete studies on bacteria, of which 11 showed a statistically significant decrease in UV rate constants with increasing RH. The effect is broken down into categories of high (Hi) RH and low (Lo) RH to simplify interpretation. The two studies that imply an increase in UV rate constant showed an essentially flat response, within experimental error, and so are listed as having no effect. Table 3 .4 also compares the results of these studies on airborne rate constants with averages for water-based rate constants. Figure 3 .7 illustrates the results of Table 3 .4 in the form of a plot as the relative humidity goes from low to high, and then to the water-based rate constant as an endpoint. It has been suggested in the literature that airborne rate constants at 100% RH converge towards water rate constants. Although it would be convenient if the UV rate constant at 100% RH equaled the UV rate constant in water there is no conclusive evidence that this occurs. In fact, photoprotective effects due to UV scattering in air (refractive index = 1.0003) must be different from those in water (refractive index = 1.33) and therefore even at 100% RH the UV rate constant in air is unlikely to be identical to that in water. It can be concluded that, in general, UV rate constants in air at high RH converge towards those in water, but are not necessarily identical at 100% RH. Figure 3 .8 presents a detailed plot summarizing the results for the various studies on Serratia marcescens. It can be seen that there are wide variations in the measured UV rate constants in these studies and that although most of them indicate an increased susceptibility with increasing RH, one of them indicates the opposite. In Table 3 .4). Average rate constant in water is shown as a single point at 100% RH this case, when the UV rate constant for water is placed at the 100% RH point, it is suggestive of the possibility that the UV rate constant for Serratia converges to that of water and will equal it at 100% RH, although this has yet to be conclusively demonstrated.",

            "text": "Another factor that impacts disinfection modeling is the phenomenon of photoreactivation. Photoreactivation occurs when microorganisms are exposed to visible light during or after UV irradiation (Setlow and Carrier 1966, Fletcher et al. 2003) . This process can result in self-repair of damaged microbes and can cause a fraction of the population to recover from UV inactivation. Photoreactivation has been studied at length in water-based UV experiments but the data for photoreactivation of airborne microbes is limited at present (Linden and Darby 1994, Masschelein 2002) . One study indicates the decay rate of Mycobacterium parafortuitum under UV exposure in liquid suspension is effectively decreased by simultaneous exposure to visible light (Peccia and Hernandez 2001) . The same study suggests that airborne microbial populations can recover significantly if allowed sufficient time. Knudson (1986) investigated the photoreactivation of Bacillus anthracis and found that although vegetative cells had a 1-2 log higher survival rate after exposure to photoreactivating light, the spore forms had no detectable photoreactivation.",

Ideally, the RH would be kept below approximately 65% in any UVGI system, and the UVGI enclosure should admit little or no internal visible light. Studies on photoreactivation generally involve narrow band UVC lamps, whereas the evidence suggests that broad band UV lamps inhibit photoreactivation (Masschelein 2002) . Damage to the enzymes needed for photoreactivation may occur more easily under broadband UVC/UVB radiation, since the peak absorption efficiency for enzymes is at higher wavelengths than that for DNA. Harm (1980) showed that absorption by proteins in the UVA and UVB region equaled the absorption by DNA at 265 nm. Hu et al. (2005) have shown that the DNA of Escherichia coli was repaired following irradiation with a low pressure, narrow-band UV lamp while there was no photorepair following irradiation with a medium pressure, broad-band UV lamp. Zimmer and Slawson (2002) found that high levels of photorepair, peaking after 2-3 hours, occurred in E. coli after exposure from low pressure lamps, virtually no photorepair occurred after exposure from medium pressure lamps.",

(2007) modeled photoreactivation in terms of first and second order reactivation constants. They found that photoreactivation was less than 0.1% in the dark, and modeled this type of photoreactivation with a zero-order rate constant. Photorepair is generally found to be higher at lower UV doses (Hu et al. 2005) . The degree of photoreactivation depends on the available light energy after UV exposure as well as the relative humidity. Tosa and Hirata (1999) found that photoreactivation was achieved in E. coli at 2 W/m 2 and varied from 20 to 78%. Peccia and Hernandez (2001) found that photoreactivation of Mycobacterium parafortuitum was only observed when RH above 80% and that no photoreactivation was detectable below 65% RH. Fletcher et al. (2003) found that photoreactivation of Serratia marcescens occurred over a wide range of UV doses and increased at lower RH. Photoreactivation occurred at a rate of 56% in M. tuberculosis and at 40% in M. marinum, at UV doses that produced 2-4 logs of inactivation, by David et al. (1971) . Harris et al. (1987) demonstrated photoreactivation in E. coli and Streptococcus faecalis and stated that the UV doses for 99.9% inactivation were approximately double when photoreactivation occurred. Jagger et al. (1970) investigated the action spectrum for photoreactivation in S. griseus and found that the effect was wavelength-dependent and temperature dependent with peaks at 313 nm and 436 nm. A second microbe, S. coelicolor, was found to have a photoreactivation peak at 313 nm but no temperature dependence. Knudson (1985) found that photoreactivation in various species of Legionella increased survival about 2-4 times when inactivation levels were 90-99.9%. Oguma et al. (2001) exposed Cryptosporidium parvum to fluorescent light after UV inactivation and determined that although pyrimidine dimers were continuously repaired under the near-UV light, the infectivity of the pathogen did not recover.",
