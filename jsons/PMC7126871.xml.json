For example, 1\u2032-C-Me adenosine is rapidly degraded in aqueous solutions at pH <7.3 However, C-nucleoside, in which the sugar and the base are linked through the C\u2013C bond, should be hydrolytically stable even with a 1\u2032-substituent.

Such nucleoside inhibitors should be converted by intracellular kinases to the triphosphorylated nucleosides, which then function as competitors of the natural nucleoside triphosphates (TP) in RNA synthesis. 7-Deazaadenosine (1, Tubercidin) is a naturally occurring, cytotoxic N-nucleoside. It is triphosphorylated inside the cells and then incorporated into RNA by host RNA polymerases, which is believed to be the main mode of action for the observed cytotoxicity.4 A C-nucleoside analog of 1, 4-aza-7.9-dideazaadenosine (2) has shown equally potent cytotoxicity to cancer cell lines.5 The TP of 2 was also shown to be a substrate of host RNA polymerases and incorporated into RNA (unpublished results). Thus, we chose compound 2 as a template to investigate the effect of the 1\u2032-substituent on antiviral activity and selectivity. Here, we report (1) preparation of a series of novel 1\u2032-substituted analogs of compound 2, (2) their antiviral activities against a panel of RNA viruses, and (3) correlation of the observed anti-HCV potency with both intrinsic enzyme (HCV NS5B) activity and intracellular level of the corresponding TP.Compounds 3a\u20133d were prepared from a common intermediate 6, which was obtained from coupling of the bromo heterocycle 4\n6 with the ribonolactone 5 (Scheme 1\n).7 The resulting hemiketal 6 was reacted with TMSCN and AlMe3 in the presence of BF3\u2013Et2O affording compounds 7a (R = CN) and 7b (R = Me), respectively,7 while with vinyl magnesium bromide and ethynyl magnesium chloride followed by dehydrative ring closure with methanesulfonic acid providing compounds 7c (R = vinyl) and 7d (R = ethynyl), respectively.8 These products were obtained as mixtures of the two stereoisomers at the 1\u2032-position. Subsequent debenzylation using BCl3 provided, after chromatographic separation of the two isomers, the desired nucleosides 3a\u20133d.",

The results are summarized in Table 2. The prodrugs 9a and 9b showed markedly enhanced replicon activity when compared to the parent nucleosides. These monophosphate prodrugs afforded >100-fold higher levels of the TP species than the parent nucleosides. Corresponding to the increased potency, an increase in cytotoxicity was also observed for the 4 prepared prodrugs. The selectivity indices (CC50/EC50) of 9b, 9c and 9d were less than 10-fold making it difficult to differentiate HCV activity from cellular toxicity. The greater potency and selectivity observed for 9a (EC50 of 0.085 \u03bcM and selectivity of 40-fold) likely reflects a combination of the potent enzyme activity and the high intracellular TP concentration (4220 pmol/million cells when cells were incubated with 10 \u03bcM of 9a). Further structural modification to improve the selectivity of 3a and 9a is warranted.",
