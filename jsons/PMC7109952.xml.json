Households were identified by contacting a random sample of participants who had taken part in a large population-based survey of an urban, primarily immigrant Latino community (http://www.wicer.org). For the current study, eligible households had 3 or more members with at least 1 member under 18 years of age, were Spanish- or English-speaking, and had a cellular telephone with text messaging. During household visits, 1 person volunteered to be the household reporter, and research staff collected sociodemographic information and health history for all household members from the household reporter. The institutional review boards of the Columbia University Medical Center (New York, New York) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia) approved this study.",

The use of text messaging as a surveillance tool has several advantages. Currently, 90% of US adults own a cell phone (19). Minority adults also often use text messaging (20), which could make text messaging a particularly effective mechanism for conducting surveillance in minority populations (20, 21). Text messaging also prompts timely reporting, which can decrease recall bias. A key feature of text messaging is scalability, allowing large numbers of participants to be monitored at one time; after the initial investment, the cost of each additional message is negligible. Messages can be automated and sent simultaneously to as many people as desired. If precoded responses are used, as in this study, screening of responses is also rapid. Additionally, while many people can be accessed simultaneously across large geographical areas and in different languages, the sending of the messages can be centralized; this allows widespread deployment with standardization of data collection.",

However, these strategies have not been fully validated (28), and they can only collect aggregate data without any specific details about any 1 individual's illness. More importantly, these strategies monitor trends of people discussing or searching for ARI-/ILI-related subject matter, and as such there cannot be confirmation of symptoms. Additionally, samples cannot be obtained to confirm an infectious etiology; confirmation of ARI/ILI etiology is important, since there is poor correlation between ILI symptoms and actual laboratory-confirmed influenza (29). In our study, surveillance by text messaging allowed collection of individual-level data as well as collection of a respiratory specimen for confirmation of disease. The use of text messaging also facilitated rapid collection, resulting in most specimens being obtained within 48\u201372 hours of symptom onset, when viral shedding is highest (10). However, in this study there was no difference in the detection of a respiratory viral pathogen among samples obtained within 72 hours of symptom onset and samples obtained after 72 hours; this finding may be due to the ability of polymerase chain reaction assays to detect small amounts of virus or nonviable virus after several days of illness.",

            "text": "There were limitations to this study. Although participation rates were high, persons who chose to participate could have differed from the general population. For example, text-message surveillance may be difficult to perform in the elderly (19, 30). As with any surveillance study, there is a risk of underreporting, but we received 73% of expected replies. Since households reported twice weekly, we do not know how reporting would have been affected if they were only asked to report once a week. However, we have not received complaints about twice-weekly reporting, and this frequency allows for optimal timing of specimen collection. We do not know the extent to which compensation paid to participating households may have contributed to reporting rates. The issues associated with compensation for participating in ongoing active surveillance are likely to be the same regardless of the data collection method utilized. However, reaching and tracking each household by phone is more time-consuming than sending 1 batch of text messages simultaneously and following up via phone solely with those who report symptoms. It also may be more burdensome and intrusive for families to have to answer a phone call as opposed to returning a text message at a time that is convenient for them. In addition, tracking of phone calls requires more data entry than tracking of text message replies, which can be automatically retrieved from the text message platform. In future studies, investigators could assess differences in reporting and costs for phone reporting versus text messaging. We identified a respiratory pathogen for only 65% of ARI/ILI episodes, although this is consistent with other studies using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays (31, 32). Finally, the project was conducted in an English- and Spanish-speaking low-income urban population. Thus, our findings may not apply to other communities, and this should be assessed.",
