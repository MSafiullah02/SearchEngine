Until recently, however, methods to maintain interactive performance at the scale of today's media collections have not been addressed. We propose an interactive learning approach that builds on and extends the state of the art in user relevance feedback systems and high-dimensional indexing for multimedia. We report on a detailed experimental study using the ImageNet and YFCC100M collections, containing 14 million and 100 million images respectively. The proposed approach outperforms the relevant state-of-the-art approaches in terms of interactive performance, while improving suggestion relevance in some cases. In particular, even on YFCC100M, our approach requires less than 0.3 s per interaction round to generate suggestions, using a single computing core and less than 7 GB of main memory.",

As the general public has been given tools for unprecedented media production, storage and sharing, media generation and consumption have increased drastically in recent years. Furthermore, upcoming multimedia applications in countless domains-from smart urban spaces and business intelligence to health and wellness, lifelogging, and entertainmentincreasingly require joint modelling of multiple modalities [20, 47] . Finally, users expect to be able to work very efficiently with large-scale collections, even with the limited computing resources they have at their immediate disposal. All these trends contribute to making scalability a greater concern than ever before. An outline of the user relevance feedback approach proposed in this paper. The shaded area indicates that the traditional relevance feedback pipeline is enhanced with a novel query mechanism to a state-of-the-art cluster-based high-dimensional index.",

There has been relatively little work on user relevance feedback and truly scalable and interactive multimedia systems in general in the last decade, however, which recently raised serious concerns in the multimedia community [39] .

As illustrated in Fig. 1 , the proposed approach tightly integrates high-dimensional indexing with the interactive learning process. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first scalable interactive learning method to go beyond utilizing clustering in the preprocessing phase only. To evaluate the approach, we propose a new zero-shot inspired evaluation protocol over the ImageNet collection, and use an existing protocol for the large-scale YFCC100M collection. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both suggestion relevance and interactive performance. In particular, our approach requires less than 0.3 s per interaction round to generate suggestions from the YFCC100M collection, using a single CPU core and less than 7 GB of main memory.",

The most popular flavour of interactive learning is user relevance feedback that presents the user, in each interaction round, with the items for which the classification model is most confident [36] . User relevance feedback has frequently been used in the best performing entries of benchmarks focusing on interactive video search and exploration [28, 41] . However, those solutions were designed for collections far smaller than YFCC100M, which is the challenge we take in this paper. Linear models for classification, such as Linear SVM are still amongst the most frequent choices in relevance feedback applications [22, 31, 48] due to their simplicity, interpretability and explainability as well as the ability to produce accurate results with few annotated samples and scale to very large collections.",

We argue that LSH and related methods fail to satisfy the three requirements above: they focus on quality guarantees rather than performance guarantees (R1); hashing creates \"slices\" in high-dimensional space, making ranking based on distance to a decision boundary difficult (R2); and they typically focus on -range queries, giving no guarantees on the number of results returned (R3). A second class of methods is based on vector quantization, typically using clustering approaches, such as k-means, to determine a set of representative feature vectors to use for the quantization. These methods create Vorono\u00ef cells in the high-dimensional space, which satisfy R2 well. Some methods, such as BoW-based methods, only store image identifiers in the clusters, thus failing to support R3, while others store the entire features, allowing to rank the results from the farthest clusters. Finally, many clustering methods seek to match well the distribution of data in the high-dimensional space. Typically, these methods end with a large portion of the collection in a single cluster, which in turn takes very long to read and score, thus failing to satisfy R1 [12] .",

PQ-compression was compared directly with the Blackthorn compression method designed for interactive learning [48] and was shown as having inferior performance.

For each collection, cluster representatives are selected randomly and clusters are formed by assigning images to the nearest cluster based on Euclidean distance, computed efficiently directly in compressed space. The indexing algorithm recursively selects 1% of the images at each level as representatives for the level above, until fewer than 100 representatives remain to form the root of the index. As an example, the bottom level of the index for each modality in the YFCC100M collection consists of 992, 066 clusters, organized in a 3 level deep index hierarchy, which gives on average 100 images per cluster and per internal node.

Third, if all b clusters are small, the system may not be able to identify r candidates, in which case it simply returns all the candidates found. Finally, we observe that treating all b clusters equally results in an over-emphasis on items that score very highly in only one modality, but have a low score in the other modality. This can be troublesome if the relevant items have a decent score in both modalities. By segmenting the b clusters into S c segments of size b/S c this dominance can be avoided; we explore the impact of S c in Sect. 4.3.",

The x-axis shows how many clusters are read for scoring at each round, ranging from b = 1 to b = 512 (note the logarithmic scale of the axis), while the y-axis shows the average precision across the first 10 rounds of analysis. The figure shows precision for two Exquisitor variants, with S c = 1 and S c = 16. In both cases, only one worker is used, w = 1. For comparison, the figure also shows the average precision for Blackthorn, the state-of-the-art SVM-based alternative. As Fig. 4 shows, result quality is surprisingly good when scoring only a single cluster in each interaction round, returning about two-thirds of the precision of the state-of-the-art algorithm. As more clusters are considered, quality then improves further. As expected, dividing the b clusters into S c = 16 chunks results in better quality, an effect that becomes more pronounced as b grows. In particular, with b = 256, Exquisitor returns significantly better results than Blackthorn. The reason is that by assigning the b relevant clusters to S c = 16 segments, Exquisitor is able to emphasize the bi-modal media items as explained in Sect. 3.3. Note that as further clusters are added with Exquisitor (b = 512 and beyond), the results become more and more similar to the Blackthorn results. Figure 5 , on the other hand, shows the latency per interaction round. The figure again shows the two Exquisitor variants, with S c = 1 and S c = 16; in both cases, one worker is used, w = 1. For comparison, as before, it also shows the average latency for Blackthorn (with 16 CPU cores). Unsurprisingly, Fig. 5 shows linear growth in latency with respect to b (recall the logarithmic x-axis). With b = 256, each interaction round takes less than 0.3 s with S c = 16, and about 0.17 s with S c = 1. Both clearly allow for interactive performance; the remainder of our experiments focus on b = 256. If even shorter latency is desired, however, fewer clusters can be read: b = 32, for example, also gives a good tradeoff between latency and result quality. This latency is produced using only a single CPU core, meaning that the latency is \u223c4x better than Blackthorn, with 16x fewer computing cores, for an improvement of \u223c64x, or nearly two orders of magnitude. With this knowledge we see b as a parameter that is determined by collection size and the task a user is dealing with, but, as a general starting point we recommend b = 256 for large collections. Comparison: Figure 6 shows the tradeoff between result quality, measured by average precision across 10 rounds of interaction, and the average latency required to produce the suggestions in each round. For Exquisitor, the figure essentially summarizes Figs. 4 and 5. For kNN+eCP, the dots represent the same b parameter values, while for the LSH-based approaches a variety of parameter values are represented. The figure clearly demonstrates that Exquisitor is the best approach in both precision and response time compared to all the baseline approaches, achieving better precision than Blackthorn, requiring less than 0.3 s compared to Blackthorn's 1.2 s. Both k-NN-bases approaches get stuck at 6% which is to be expected since the k-NN query narrows down the scope of the search making it impossible to get out of local optima. SVM+LSH performs better, with precision nearly as good as Blackthorn and response time close to Exquisitor. Overall, however, Exquisitor performs better partly due to being able to utilize the SVM during cluster selection with k-FN queries, and partly due to the cluster segments allowing better multi-modal results.",

            "text": "In this paper, we presented Exquisitor, a new approach for exploratory analysis of very large image collections with modest computational requirements. Exquisitor combines state-of-the-art large-scale interactive learning with a new clusterbased retrieval mechanism, enhancing the relevance capabilities of interactive learning by exploiting the inherent structure of the data. Through experiments conducted on YFCC100M, the largest publicly available multimedia collection, Exquisitor achieves higher precision and lower latency, with less computational resources. Additionally, through a modified zero-shot learning experiment on ImageNet, we determine the Exquisitor approach to be excellent at solving cumbersome classification tasks. Exquisitor also introduces customizability that is, to the best of our knowledge, previously unseen in large-scale interactive learning by: (i) allowing a tradeoff between low latency (few clusters) and high quality (many clusters); and (ii) combatting data skew by omitting huge (and thus likely nondescript) clusters from consideration. Exquisitor has recently been used successfully in interactive media retrieval competitions such as the Lifelog Search Challenge [21] and Video Browser Showdown [19] . In conclusion, Exquisitor provides excellent performance on very large collections while being efficient enough to bring large-scale multimedia analytics to standard desktops and laptops, and even high-end mobile devices.",
