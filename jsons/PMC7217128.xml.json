We recruited inpatients cared in the ICU from January 10, 2020, to February 10, 2020, who have been diagnosed as COVID-19, according to World Health Organization interim guidance (10). Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was performed by the local health authority as previously described (11). Data of the patients were achieved by reviewing the admission logs and histories from all available electronic medical records and patient care resources. The patients were followed up to February 25, 2020. This study was approved by the Ethics Commission of Tongji Hospital (TJ-IRB20200225).",

The difference of categorical variables between the survivors and deaths groups was compared by chi-square test or Fisher exact test when appropriate, whereas continuous variables were compared using Student t test. Spearman correlation analysis was performed among significant variables in the univariate analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to explore the effect of APACHE II score, SOFA score, and CURB65 score on the occurrence of death. Taking account of the potential bias, only variables with the absolute value of a correlation coefficient less than 0.4 were included in the initial model of multivariate Cox regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were conducted to evaluate and compare the predictive value of these three scoring systems. The scoring system with largest area under the curve (AUC) of ROC curve was selected for further analysis. The cut-off value of the selected scoring system was determined based on the maximum Youden index. Then the patients with COVID-19 were classified into two groups: low risk, less than cut-off point value and high risk, greater than or equal to cut-off point value. Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the survival between these two groups with log-rank test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R Project version 3.6.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; http://cran.r-project.org).",

In a cohort of 38 critical patients with SARS in Canada, 43% of patients had died at 28 days (13). Fifty-eight percentage of patients had died at 90 days in a Saudi Arabia cohort with 12 patients with MERS (14). Yang et al (6) reported 61.5% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 had died at 28 days. In our cohort, two thirds of critically ill patients died. The mortality of patients with COVID-2019 was higher than that previously seen in critically ill patients with SARS and MERS. Several of the reasons are as follows. First, a large number of COVID-19 cases occurred in a short period of time led to difficulty in hospitalization treatment. In our cohort, the duration from onset to hospitalization was longer in deaths than that in survivors. Second, as an emerging infectious disease, the clinical characteristics and pathophysiologic features of the patients with COVID-19 have been known little at the start of the epidemic. Although the shortage of medical staff has been improved with assistance from other provinces from all over the country, the number of doctors and nurses of critical care medicine remains inadequate. Because of the considerable mortality of patients with COVID-19, a clinically predictive system for early warning of mortality risk is urgently needed.",

            "text": "The cut-off value of APACHE II score in COVID-19 is much lower to predict mortality. Several reasons may explain it. First, GCS is an important component of APACHE II score. Direct damage to the nervous system by SARS-CoV-2 was rarely reported. Only a few patients had a disturbance of consciousness in the study. Most of them suffered from hypoxemia-induced ischemic hypoxic encephalopathy and one was attributed to underlying cerebral hemorrhage. Second, APACHE II score was assessed according to the characteristics of the patients on the first day of ICU admission. Abnormal levels of serum sodium and potassium were observed in some patients, but only a few patients got scores for the corresponding part in APACHE II score. Finally, according to our observation, several patients deteriorated during their stay in the hospital in a few days and quickly died. Although timely given powerful empirical treatments including glucocorticoid, immunoglobulin, mechanical ventilation, etc, the patients were still hard to recover from COVID-19. A recent study showed the median APACHE II score of survivors and deaths in critically ill patients with COVID-19 were 14 and 18, respectively (6). This indicated that COVID-19 might be more variable and mortal, compared with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.",

            "text": "APACHE II score, SOFA score, and CURB65 score are commonly used to describe multiple organ function for assessing disease severity and estimate hospital mortality (7, 9, 15). According to recent reports, any underlying disorder was significantly more common in severe cases when compared with nonsevere cases. The medical history of coronary heart disease was an independent determinant of critical illness of the patients with COVID-19 (16), and it was also associated with a higher risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19 (17). In this cohort, about half of patients had one or more underlying comorbidities, and coronary heart disease was more common in deaths than in survivors. It suggested that comorbidities played an important role in the death of the patients with COVID-19. Age has also been identified to be associated with the severity and death in patients with COVID-19 based on the present and previous studies (18\u201320). Of the three score systems, only APACHE II score includes comorbidities and age, whereas CURB65 score takes into account only age, and SOFA score takes into account neither of them. These may explain why APACHE II score performed better than the other two for predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19.",

In the present study, we found that the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio was higher in deaths than that in survivors. Qu et al (21) also demonstrated that high platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio was associated with severe illness in patients with COVID-19. Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio mainly reflects the level of systemic inflammation, and high value may lead to adverse outcome. Recent studies have shown that the proportion of developing liver injury in patients with severe COVID-19 was significantly higher than that in mild patients (22\u201324). Our study also found that the proportion of liver dysfunction was higher in the deaths group than that in the survivors group, consistent with the other study (25). Currently, studies on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2\u2013related liver injury are limited. It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 also uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as its entry receptor as SARS-Cov does (26). Whether it results in liver damage in patients remains to be investigated. Troponin I was significantly increased in patients with severe COVID-19 compared with those with milder illness (16). The mechanisms may be similar to that of myocardial injury in other severe respiratory illnesses in which myocardial oxygen demand is heightened and inflammation is rampant (27). Further studies are need to confirm the mechanisms underlying these findings.",

Therefore, the mortality of patients with COVID-19 in this study may be much higher than general population (28) and may be not generalized. Third, the treatments may influence the outcomes of patients with COVID-19. But in this study, we aimed to apply the characteristics of the patients at the first day admitted to ICU to predict the outcome of the patients with COVID-19.
