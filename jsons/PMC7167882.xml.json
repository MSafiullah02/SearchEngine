            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large, enveloped, positive\u2010sense RNA viruses that infect birds and a wide range of mammals, including humans. These viruses are composed of a few structural proteins that hold a relatively long (around 30 kb) positive\u2010stranded genome (Figure 1). They occur worldwide and can cause diseases of medical and veterinary significance. Generally, infections are localized to the respiratory, enteric and/or nervous systems, although systemic disease has been observed in a number of host species 1, 2. At present, six CoVs have been identified that infect humans. Human CoVs HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43 predominantly cause a mild respiratory tract infection, characterized by upper respiratory tract disease that includes coryza, cough and sore throat. These viruses only occasionally induce lower respiratory tract disease, including bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. In contrast, two recently emerged CoVs induce a more severe lower respiratory infection that may be fatal, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS\u2010CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS\u2010CoV) 10, 11. The SARS outbreak started in 2002 in China and, after rapid global spread through human\u2010to\u2010human transmission, was halted in 2004. The number of cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) was 8096, including 774 deaths 12. Ten years later, the MERS outbreak started in the Middle East and is still ongoing. A total number of 837 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases have been reported to the WHO, including 291 fatalities 13.",

Given the fact that MERS\u2010CoV seems to be widely present in dromedary camels in the Middle East and some parts of Africa 18, 19, zoonotic transmission is likely to have originated from this animal species and is expected to continue for a long period of time in these regions. Through usage of a common entry receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the emergence of MERS\u2010CoV in humans from dromedary camels, and potentially earlier in time from bats, is facilitated (Figure 2).",

The hospital outbreaks are mostly due to person\u2010to\u2010person transmission in haemodialysis units, intensive care units or in\u2010patient units, where patients are infected with MERS\u2010CoV of a single monophyletic clade 23. An outbreak among healthcare workers in a hospital was due to overcrowding and inadequate infection control measures 25. It is still unclear whether the transmission through person\u2010to\u2010person contact occurs via large respiratory droplets, due to coughing and sneezing, as in SARS, or via fomites 23, 25, 26. Also, the episodes of transmission are not clearly defined but are reported to take place during both the symptomatic and the incubation phases 20. Repeated testing of sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) at different time points will be needed to provide a better understanding 20. Some of the larger clusters of patients observed in Al Hasa and Jeddah may be primarily related to human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of MERS\u2010CoV, but super\u2010spreader events, as described during the SARS outbreak, have not been noted thus far. This may be due to an overall lower level of virus shedding from the upper respiratory tract contributing to lower transmissibility than seen in SARS 26. As a result, the outbreak is more restricted when compared to SARS, although future adaptations of MERS\u2010CoV in humans may potentially increase human\u2010to\u2010human transmission or may alter the virulence of the virus, causing more severe disease.",

Dromedary camels infected with MERS\u2010CoV may not show disease but still may excrete MERS\u2010CoV through nasal fluids, faeces and, potentially, in their milk and urine 27. Therefore, the WHO recommends avoiding contact with camels, not drinking raw camel milk or camel urine and not eating meat that has not been thoroughly cooked. Also, people who work, or come into contact with, dromedary camels, such as people working at camel farms, slaughterhouses, markets and camel\u2010racing facilities, and also veterinarians, are at risk and should practise good personal hygiene and wear facial protection and protective clothing where feasible 28.",

The median incubation period of a MERS\u2010CoV infection is 5 days 20. Current data indicate that, overall, more men than women have become infected, with a median age of 47 years (range 9 months\u201394 years), and most fatalities are observed in patients over 60 years 20, 22. Clinical symptoms observed include fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, myalgia, chest pain, malaise and gastro\u2010intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Less common symptoms include chills, wheezing, palpitations and confusion 20, 21, 22, 29. Respiratory symptoms are mainly related to lower respiratory tract disease (dyspnoea, cough and fever), while upper respiratory tract disease is reported infrequently. A large proportion of the severely ill patients required mechanical ventilation 30. Interestingly, many of the reported secondary cases showed mild respiratory symptoms or were asymptomatic 31.",

In SARS, a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms is described, similar to that seen in MERS; fever, chills, diarrhoea and pneumonia 39. In both conditions severely ill patients presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure that often required mechanical ventilation. Although both viruses are considered respiratory viruses, gastro\u2010intestinal infections and symptoms have been described in both SARS and MERS patients. The case\u2010fatality rate may seem higher for MERS\u2010CoV (around 30%) than for SARS\u2010CoV (9.6%), but whether this is the result of a higher virulence of MERS\u2010CoV is not clear, since many MERS\u2010CoV infections may have gone unnoticed. Similar co\u2010morbidities have been described for both MERS and SARS.

The laboratory findings more often showed higher levels of parameters associated with liver and kidney dysfunction in SARS than in the described cases of MERS, although acute renal failure is often seen in MERS. Complications during pregnancy, such as maternal mortality and stillbirth, have been described in SARS and thus far only rarely seen in MERS cases, but that may be attributable to decreased maternal tolerance to hypoxia and reduced fetal oxygen flow due to respiratory disease 38.",

One way to predict the changes in the lungs after MERS\u2010CoV infection is to use human tissue that has been infected ex vivo 68. Hocke et al\n69 demonstrated widespread MERS\u2010CoV antigen expression in type I and II alveolar cells, ciliated bronchial epithelium and unciliated cuboid cells of terminal bronchioles, using spectral confocal microscopy. Virus antigen was also found in endothelial cells of pulmonary vessels and rarely in alveolar macrophages. Electron microscopy revealed alveolar epithelial damage, consisting of detachment of type II alveolar epithelial cells and associated disruption of tight junctions, chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation and membrane blebbing, the latter suggesting apoptosis 69. Although this ex vivo model does not fully mimic the situation in vivo, these changes are in line with observations in cell lines infected with MERS\u2010CoV. Severe cytopathic effects were observed in human hepatoma cells infected with MERS\u2010CoV; these were more severe than those due to SARS\u2010CoV infection 70, although the in vivo relevance of this observation remains unclear.",

A comparative analysis of HCoV receptor expression across the respiratory tract of humans may provide clues regarding differences in pathobiology between HCoVs. In cell lines and ex vivo lung cultures, DPP4 is expressed in type I and II alveolar cells, ciliated and non\u2010ciliated bronchial epithelium, bronchial submucosal glands, endothelium, alveolar macrophages and leukocytes 68, 71.

At present, only one comparative in vitro study using MERS\u2010CoV has been performed 87. Calu3 cells, differentiated into polarized ciliated cells, permit replication of both SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV at similar levels. However, MERS\u2010CoV induces a substantial cytopathic effect, starting 18\u201324 h after infection, whereas SARS\u2010CoV maintains steady replication and cell viability until 72 h after infection 70, 77, 87. On the other hand, MERS\u2010CoV seems more sensitive to prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of infection in vitro than SARS\u2010CoV 70. In addition, MERS\u2010CoV induces much greater dysregulation of the host response to infection than SARS\u2010CoV. MERS\u2010CoV specifically down\u2010regulates genes involved in the antigen\u2010presentation pathway, which could have substantial implications for the development of adaptive immune responses 87. With respect to the analysis of the immune response in humans infected with MERS\u2010CoV, limited data from two patients with different disease outcomes are available to date. In BAL and serum from the patient with a poor outcome, there was a decrease in interferon (IFN)\u03b1 as well as decreased expression of retinoic inducible\u2010acid gene (RIG)\u20101, melanoma differentiation\u2010associated protein 5 (MDA5) and interferon regulatory factors (IRF)3 and IRF7, which are involved in the recognition of viruses by the innate immune system. In the patient with poor outcome there were also high levels of CXC\u2010motif chemokines ligand (CXCL)10 and interleukin (IL)\u201010, which may have resulted in lower IFN\u03b3 expression and higher levels of IL\u201017A and IL\u201023 88. In the patient who survived, rapid clearance of the virus with increased levels of IL\u201012 and IFN\u03b3 was noted 88.",

            "text": "At this time it is difficult to describe or predict the pathology of severe respiratory disease from MERS\u2010CoV infection. First, there are no reports on autopsies of human fatal MERS cases. This is partly related to the religious backgrounds of the patients, which exclude autopsy. Although limited numbers of human fatal SARS patients have been described, these studies indicate an immunopathological component that may dominate the pathogenesis of SARS. Second, to gain more knowledge of fatal MERS in humans, further studies are needed in animal models that could provide information on replication dynamics, clinical disease, histological lesions and cellular tropism. Third, the patients with severe MERS have very diverse pre\u2010existing conditions, and therefore it may be difficult to obtain definite answers from these studies. Virus\u2010induced histological changes may be obscured by clinical treatments or pre\u2010existing disease. Thus, it may be very difficult to know the full scope of this disease, including the histological lesions, viral cellular tropism and pathogenesis of MERS\u2010CoV. On the other hand, although there are better descriptive studies of SARS regarding the pathology induced in the lower respiratory tract, these provided limited benefit for the development of intervention strategies. Therapeutically, corticosteroids were used for the treatment of SARS, producing variable improvement with less fever, reduced inflammatory infiltrates and better oxygenation 99. More promising results were obtained with the administration of IFNs in SARS patients. In fact, in vitro studies have demonstrated that MERS\u2010CoV is more sensitive to type I IFN than SARS\u2010CoV. Overall, the current available data on MERS\u2010CoV suggest that patients at risk for severe exacerbations after infection are elderly patients or patients who have underlying co\u2010morbid conditions. These patients may not be able to combat the viral infection with type I IFN host responses as efficiently as other patient groups, as aging and co\u2010morbid conditions have been described to have a negative effect on the ability to mount strong type I IFN responses 84, 100. The sensitivity of MERS\u2010CoV in vitro to type I IFN may indicate that type I IFN can be used as a prophylactic/therapeutic intervention strategy in vivo.",
