            "text": "Most public health laboratories world-wide are expected to have an extensive repertoire of tests available for the rapid diagnosis of both endemic and exotic viral diseases (Frank, 2005, Rotz et al., 2000, Rotz et al., 2002). Ready access to scientific journals has allowed the rapid introduction of molecular assays for a wide range of exotic viruses while access to genomic databases via the internet has enabled the development of in-house molecular assays in a variety of formats for a wide array of pathogens. The biggest stumbling block for laboratories introducing such assays is the lack of appropriate positive control material. Ironically the increasing concern over terrorism which has heightened demand for a broadly expanded diagnostic capability has also increased restrictions on the importation and export of exotic viruses or even extracted genetic material for use as controls for such assays. In Australia, laboratories face the dual obstacles of identifying a country prepared to release the material plus the difficulties of convincing Australian quarantine authorities to approve the importation of such material for diagnostic purposes.",

The problems of false-positive results due to cross contamination in the molecular diagnostic laboratory are now well known and well documented (Aslanzadeh, 2004, Borst et al., 2004, Landry, 1995. Teles et al., 2005). The problem of false-positive results can be greatly reduced providing testing is conducted in appropriately designed facilities with dedicated rooms for reagent preparation, nucleic acid extraction, amplification and post PCR analysis and provided strict enforcement of directional movement of people and materials are observed (Borst et al., 2004, Millar et al., 2002). Even when dedicated rooms and directional movement is employed false-positives can still occur (Borst et al., 2004). In these circumstances the source of contamination can often be linked to the extraction of other positive samples in the same room at the same time. Since positive controls are included in every extraction procedure these can often represent the most common source of contaminating nucleic acids. Intact virus, extracted viral nucleic acid or cloned, unmodified viral segments all represent a potential source of contaminating nucleic acid when employed as positive controls.",

Either method can be used for RNA (or DNA) viruses and both are suitable for adoption by any laboratory capable of performing PCR. Both methods are used routinely in our laboratory for all molecular assays irrespective of whether we hold the virus in our collection or not. The first method is applicable to real-time PCR (TaqMan) assays while the second method is suitable for conventional single round or nested PCRs. These methods have been used to establish \u2018controlled\u2019 assays for a variety of viral diseases which are exotic to Australia but which could be introduced into the country via international air travel or through intentional release. An in-house developed TaqMan assay and a reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR test based on a published method for SARS coronavirus (Drosten et al., 2003) will be used for illustrative purposes to describe the construction of controls for both tests. This paper is intended to present a generic approach for the production of synthetic controls, not to describe in detail molecular diagnostic tests for SARS for which many have already been described and compared (Mahony et al., 2004, Drosten et al., 2003).",

The cDNA was amplified by cycling for 40 cycles between 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. The threshold cycle (C\nt) was determined. A negative result was considered where no amplification occurred (a reaction where the C\nt was equal to or greater than 40 cycles).",

The approach does not require cloning of products, generation of genetically modified organisms, specialised containment facilities or specialised skills or knowledge. This approach allows the development of TaqMan or conventional PCR assays for virtually any virus or organism for which a published method or sequence information exists. The two approaches described here, an in-house designed TaqMan test and a nested RT-PCR test based on a published method (Drosten et al., 2003), allowed us to introduce molecular testing for SARS as soon as sequence information became available on the internet. We believe this approach will be particularly useful for those laboratories which lack appropriate physical containment facilities for propagating a particular virus or have difficulty gaining access to the organism in question due to international tightening of both import and export controls. This laboratory currently performs a large number of both TaqMan and conventional PCR tests for a broad range of endemic and exotic viral diseases for which we have actual viral stocks. Despite this we use synthetic controls, produced as described above, for all of our assays in order to reduce the risk of false-positive reactions.",

Because of the small size of the synthetic TaqMan DNA template, residual DNA is frequently present following many commercial kit-based RNA transcription reactions. Although it is not necessary for the RNA preparations to be totally free of DNA template it is important that the dilution chosen as an RT control does not produce a product following a PCR reaction which contains no RT. A simple dilution series similar to that depicted in Table 1 will allow selection of a dilution that is free of DNA template and thus suitable for use as an RT control.",

Their use also effectively eliminates the risk of contamination from either the positive control itself or from the resulting amplicon since neither the probe nor primer control can lead to a false-positive reaction as neither the rGAPDH probe or rGAPDH primers are present in the viral TaqMan reaction mix. When using this approach for producing RNA control material for use in RT-PCR or TaqMan assays it is also important to note that double stranded templates are required for effective RNA transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. This approach requires two separate control reactions (a primer control and a probe control) to be set up for each diagnostic assay. This inconvenience is easily offset by the ability to ensure that all components of the assay are working while also ensuring that there is no possibility of producing a false-positive reaction due to contamination with either control. False-negative reactions due to inhibitors and the efficacy of the extraction process can be controlled by whatever strategy a particular laboratory finds appropriate for their purposes.",

Although this approach has the potential to produce a false-positive product of the appropriate size it is easy to rule out the inadvertent amplification of the synthetic control by restriction endonuclease digestion. By using a plasmid template with a SmaI or BamHI containing multiple cloning site the product can be digested directly in the PCR buffer (without buffer exchange) with either enzyme and visualised by electrophoresis thus allowing confirmation of a positive result within 2 h. Digestion of the product to produce bands of the expected size provides rapid confirmation of a false-positive reaction. This of course is provided that the target organism does not possess a SmaI or BamHI restriction endonuclease recognition site in nearly identical locations as the synthetic control. A simple in silico analysis of the target sequence would allow this unlikely eventuality to be ruled out. The failure of SmaI or BamHI to cleave the product may warrant sequence confirmation of the product before a positive report is released depending upon the clinical or public health implications of doing so. An additional safeguard, employed here, is to design a synthetic control which is slightly smaller or larger than the expected product which thus allows immediate visual identification of a false-positive due to contamination with the synthetic control.",
