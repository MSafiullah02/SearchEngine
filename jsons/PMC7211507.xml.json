Lymphopenia is commonly observed in patients with COVID\u201019. In a cohort of 41 patients, Huang et al.\n12\n reported that 63% (26/42) of COVID\u201019 patients had lymphopenia, and the rate was markedly higher in patients admitted to the ICU than in non\u2010ICU patients (85% vs. 54%). In the first US\u2010confirmed cases of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients, the laboratory data by Holshue et al.\n13\n showed that from the third to tenth hospital day, the lymphocyte count was at a low level of 1070/\u03bcL and had gradually increased to 2100/\u03bcL along with the improved condition of the disease. In line with these reports, our data showed that the lymphocyte count was also observed to have increased near to the normal level at the moment of disease improvement. Notably, our data also showed that the increased lymphocyte count might be contributed by the increase in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. However, B cells and NK cells remain more stable at rather low levels. T cells are critical for the host\u2019s cellular immune response against viral infection. The subpopulation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can kill virus\u2010infected cells directly, and CD4+ helper T lymphocytes are essential for B lymphocytes to produce virus\u2010specific antibodies.\n14\n Recently, a study by Xu et al.\n15\n revealed that significantly decreased but hyperactivated peripheral immune cells such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were observed in a COVID\u201019 patient, and unfortunately, the patient died. The authors speculated that the hyperactivated immune cells might be involved in immune injury for the disease. However, the sampling day during the disease course for flow cytometry analysis was unclear, which is of importance for the peripheral immune cell response that could be associated with the disease status, as our present findings indicated. Consequently, the increase in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in this case, as previously reported in other infectious diseases, may play a similar antiviral role with respect to the improvement in the disease.\n16\n\n",

Data showed that HLA genes, including HLA\u2010G, were observed to be specifically downregulated after MERS\u2010CoV infection, while these genes were upregulated after SARS\u2010CoV infection. In this study, our data showed that HLA\u2010G expression in peripheral immune cells such as T cells, B cells and monocytes follows a high\u2013low\u2013high pattern, which may reflect the three stages of infection, replication and clearance of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102; however, receptors ILT2, ILT4 and KIR2DL4 remained relatively stable. Moreover, correlations between HLA\u2010G and its receptor expressions and cytokine production were observed in our study, such as different correlations between IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20102 and HLA\u2010G expression in B cells and monocytes. The dynamics of HLA\u2010G expression in peripheral immune subsets from SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010positive to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010negative indicated that the status of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection might be involved in the regulation of HLA\u2010G expression. Given that HLA\u2010G is an antigen presenter similar to other HLA I antigens, the downregulated HLA\u2010G expression by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can impair the virus CD8+ CTL\u2010mediated recognition and support immune evasion.",

First, this study is based on only one critical COVID\u201019 case, and real world of the HLA\u2010G and its receptor expressions in peripheral immune subsets in the COVID\u201019 case is still unknown. Second, the outcomes only on several time points during the 23\u2010day hospitalisation were assayed; the variation of the expression of HLA\u2010G and its receptors, and the levels of cytokines may be underestimated. Third, the underlying mechanisms involved in dynamics of HLA\u2010G and its receptors, and the levels of cytokines are yet to be explored. Therefore, more detailed and larger cohorts of the disease need to be investigated.",
