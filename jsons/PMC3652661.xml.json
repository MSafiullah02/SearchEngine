Because RNA granules regulate the mRNA cycle, metabolism, and gene expression, they comprise an important point of manipulation for viruses. The schemes of viral manipulation of RNA granules are quite variable, reflecting the diversity of viral replication strategies, and the impact of SGs on virus replication is wide\u2010ranging. Virus infection produces many types of stresses in cells, even during nonlytic infections. These perturbations of cellular homeostasis are detected in many ways in pathways that feed directly into stress responses. An emerging concept is that general stress responses and innate immune responses are both primordial, intimately linked, and interface at many levels. Typically outcomes of stress responses serve to restrict or reprogram host gene expression patterns, usually to the disadvantage of a virus. Thus, a common tendency of viruses is to block and/or co\u2010opt stress responses to foster more productive replication rates. This review covers the range of interactions between RNA viruses and cytoplasmic RNA granules, but focuses mostly on information from virus systems, where some details of the mechanisms are known. SG and PB interactions with viruses are grouped into classes according to current understanding and will require revision as further research emerges.",

            "text": "The actual molecular mechanism of mRNP aggregation into granules remains elusive but recent advances provide clues how RNA granules assemble components into coherent structures while simultaneously facilitating dynamic molecular exchange they are noted for. In particular, this may entail formation of liquid droplets or condensed gel phases that can better be envisioned as dynamic RNA/protein droplets. Such phase transitions from dispersed to condensed phases have been described to exhibit characteristic liquid droplet behavior and solutions of purified protein can also condense into droplet phases.31 Evidence suggests weak, but multivalent binding interactions between RNP proteins that involve repeated SRC homology 3 (SH3) domains, proline\u2010rich motifs (PRM) or other low complexity amino acid sequences are capable of assembling liquid phase droplets.32 Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is one example of an abundant RNA\u2010binding protein containing 27 repeats of a tripeptide that participates in hydrogels. FUS has been proposed to function in RNA neuronal granules with G3BP and TDP\u201043,33, 34, 35 though TDP\u201043 may play a more prominent functional role in SGs.36 G3BP, TIA1, and many other RNA\u2010binding proteins have domains suitable for this type of weak interaction. These protein interactions can also be affected by post\u2010translational modifications that can shift the equilibrium between the soluble and condensed phases.32, 34 For instance, G3BP is both phosphorylated and arginine methylated in association with its functional regulation.18, 37 Deacetylation of other SG target proteins may also be key for granule condensation.21 Consistent with a role of methylation in the process, increased polyamines repress SG formation, though it is not clear if this affects pathways or directly interferes with nucleation.38 Also, protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is required for RAP55 inclusion in PBs39 and RGG motif methylation and ubiquitination of TDP\u201043 modulate coaggregation with the SG\u2010nucleating protein G3BP.40\n",

            "text": "Many plus strand RNA viruses express viral proteinases that often cleave key host proteins to modify the cellular environment. To date, only enteroviruses such as poliovirus have been shown to utilize proteinases to cleave factors in RNA granules. Poliovirus infection allows V\u2010SG to form during the very early phase of infection but then SGs are dispersed and viral functions actively block stress granule assembly during the mid to late\u2010phase of infection. The mechanism of SG disassembly involves cleavage of the key stress granule nucleating protein G3BP1 by the viral 3C proteinase (3Cpro) (Figure 2). G3BP1 cleavage separates the N\u2010terminal protein\u2010interacting domain from the C\u2010terminal RNA recognition motif and presumably disrupts its SG aggregation function. Expression of a 3Cpro cleavage\u2010resistant mutant of G3BP1 rescues stress granules at late times post infection, demonstrating the importance of G3BP in the SG formation process.45 A contradicting study showed that some V\u2010SG containing the SG marker TIA1 linger late into the infection cycle,24 but a follow\u2010up study showed those granules were lacking the translation factors eIF3, eIF4G and eIF4E, and mRNA. This indicated that TIA1 granules remaining after G3BP cleavage are remnants of normal SGs and do not correlate with translational repression and accumulation of stalled translation initiation complexes that define functional SGs.17 Therefore, poliovirus unlinks TIA1 aggregation from condensation of translation initiation factors in stress granules, likely through cleavage of G3BP1. These findings emphasize reports that SG can differ in composition and function in virus infected cells and cannot be reliably stereotyped based on analysis of limited SG markers. Poliovirus infection induces eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, which simultaneously drives SG formation and inhibits cellular protein synthesis machinery required for viral RNA translation. Interestingly, poliovirus avoids this translation restriction due to 3Cpro\u2010mediated cleavage of eIF5B, which bypasses the need for eIF2\u03b1 during translation initiation on the viral IRES but is not thought to play a role in SG formation.46\n",

IAV expressing an NS1 mutant that does not bind dsRNA allows eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and SG accumulation. When SG form, virus replication is repressed, measured by expression of viral NP protein.49 Further, PKR knockout cells do not form stress granules during infection with NS1 mutant virus suggesting that repression of PKR activity by NS1 is critical for inhibition of SGs.49 Similarly, infection with an IAV NS1 deletion mutant (IAV \u0394NS1) also results in SG formation.50 The mechanism of NS1 repression of SG formation involves its interaction in a complex containing cellular RNA associated protein 55 (RAP55). RAP55 is a component of both SGs and PBs and may facilitate shuttling of mRNP cargo between them. Overexpression of RAP55 induced SGs and blocked virus replication. The portion of NS1 interacting within RAP55 complexes maps to the PKR\u2010interacting domain.51 Viral nucleoprotein (NP) colocalizes with SGs in the absence of NS1 but switches and colocalizes with PBs during wild type virus infection. A partly conflicting report found levels of IAV NP (hence replication) were not altered in infections with IAV NS1 deletion mutant (IAV \u0394NS1), despite pronounced PKR activation, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and SG formation.50 These results suggest that not only do SGs differ in composition depending on the context (discussed above), but also the same virus can interact with SGs and/or the translational apparatus in a cell type\u2010dependent manner (A549 cells vs HeLa).",

HCV subverts many PB components into novel viral replication/assembly foci with viral core protein that also contain some SG components (e.g., G3BP, Figure 2). Flaviviruses also divert PB factors into replication foci, likely bound with viral RNA through interaction with DDX6(Rck/p54). Poliovirus induces cleavage of Dcp1a and rapid degradation of Xrn1 and Pan3. Rap55 is a critical PB factor that IAV protein NS1 diverts from normal association with PBs. Bunyavirus Junin virus incorporates viral N protein into PBs to interfere with cellular Dcp1a/2 decapping function and facilitate viral cap\u2010snatching.",
