            "text": "Very soon after the outbreak of COVID-19, it became clear that DM is strongly related to the severity of the disease and a deadly outcome. However, the link between DM and COVID-19 is complex because DM is very often accompanied with other diseases, in particular cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and obesity, which all increase the risk for infection, more complications, and higher mortality from COVID-19 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Several studies have shown that DM is one of the leading risk factors for disease adversity and higher mortality. However, the importance of DM in relation to other diseases and habits that people have (i.e. smoking) cannot be easily recognized. We have systematically searched for publications, being published in the last couple of months, from which characteristics of COVID-19 patients can be extracted and used for statistical analysis. We have found 37 publication for which we list the number of COVID-19 infected patients, share of DM patients, share of DM patients which developed a severe form of the disease, overall mortality and mortality of DM patients. The aim of the analysis is to list and analyse the diverse reported outcomes of COVID-19 infected patients, which had DM and other comorbidities, and evaluate the severity of the developed disease and the mortality. Results of the analysis are captured in Table (S1).

            "text": "According to the data in Table (S1), the percentage of COVID-19 patients with DM was larger than 12% in altogether 51.4% studies included in our review [2, 8, [29] [30] [31] [32] 34, 35, 37, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 26, 27] . In 69.2% of the reports, at least 16% of DM patients had an outcome of severe disease, were treated in the ICU, or developed acute respiratory distress syndrome -ARDS [9, 10, 13, 14, 18, 22, 30, 32] . The mortality of DM patients was 10% or higher in 68.8% of the studies [2, 9, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] 25, 31, 32] . In 43.8% of the reports the overall mortality was greater than 15% [2, 8, 13, [15] [16] [17] [18] 25, 27, 29, 32, 34, 37] . This higher mortality rate is a result of data being provided by three specific studies considering only death cases [27, 29, 37] . In 5 reports the overall mortality was higher than the mortality of DM patients, but they have investigated only elderly [15, 35] , deceased [27, 29, 37] , fatal or recovered [17] , and critically ill patients [32] . In the largest group of 72.314 patients [7] , the overall mortality and the lethality of diabetic patients were nominally lower (in comparison with the most majority of the other studies in Table (S1). In this extensive study, provided on a representative sample including a vast variety of subjects, the mortality of patients with DM is more than 3-fold higher in comparison to the overall mortality.

We are focused on 6 queries, which are listed in Table (S1). In continuation, we will refer to the acquired and stored information for a given query as a database.

Thus, to assess the importance of a topic within a given database, we computed the fraction of entries in a database in which a particular topic emerges either in the abstract or in the title. We compute this metric as the ratio between the number of articles in which a given topic hold and the size of the corresponding database. The computed relative metric enables us to compare the usage of a topic among databases, which differ in their size. Furthermore, the metric can be used to quantitatively asses how frequently a topic is used in research articles for a given database. Lower values of the computed fraction thus indicate that the topic is either diluted or simply not being used commonly within a database. Also, we can use the computed fraction to assess the importance of a topic throughout the databases. This is achieved by computing the mean values of the fraction of entries among the databases and the corresponding relative standard deviation (RSTD). Those two metrics give a deeper inside into how strong a topic is and how consistent it appears throughout the different databases. The results are shown in Table (S4) . ",

In addition, such a methodology also enables studying differences in the extracted graphs [44] . In our case, we investigate how the topics (see Table S3) After the weight normalization process, the size of a given database becomes irrelevant and we can assess how important a given topic pair is within and among different databases. At this step, we have the required information to build the knowledge graph for individual databases.

Thus, we can also visually asses which nodes or topics are more interconnected within a given database. Since the defined topics are differently expressed in different databases, the weights of the edges take different values. In addition, some topic pair combinations can't even be found within a given database.",

However, since we have normalized weight values, we are now able to define more objectively the strength between a topic pair by considering all the computed adjacency matrices. To overcome database specifics that are manifested in the weight values and knowledge graph topologies, we merge the weighted adjacency matrices. During this step, we compare the edge weights between the nodes in all the computed adjacency matrices. For a given node pair, we have 6 different edge weights in a database-specific knowledge network. In the final merged knowledge network, only the edges, which have the highest weight value are accepted. More precisely, for a specific node pair, we analyze the corresponding edge weight in the different database-specific knowledge network and accept the edge with the highest values. The final knowledge graph thus highlights maximal topic-pair occurrence frequencies, when viewed from a different research perspective. The result of this process is shown in the main article in Fig. (3) .",

To build the connections or edges among topics and define the strength of the corresponding edges, we select a database and the machine-read all of its entries. In every entry, we search the processed text for any of the defined topics. If more than one topic is found in a given entry, an edge is created between all found topic-pair combinations. Also, we track how many times a topic pair simultaneously occurred in a given database and store this information as the weight of the corresponding edge. For example, if the weight between topic A and topic B equals 10, this means, that the topic pair A-B (or B-A) has been found in 10 articles. Lastly, we normalize these weights. Weight normalization is performed by computing the sum of all the weights in a knowledge graph that has been extracted for a database and normalizing the individual weights with the generated sum. The final values of the edge weights thus take on a value in the range between 0 and 1. If a topic pair, would appear in all entries, the corresponding weight value would be equal to 1. On the other hand, if a topic pair couldn't be found in any of the entries in a given database, the corresponding weight value would equal 0. In such a way we build a weighted adjacency matrix, D. The dimension of the weighted adjacency matrix equals n x n, where n is equal the number of topics. The ij-ith element of the matrix corresponds to the normalized edge weight between the topic i and the topic j. Since we do not consider the direction of the edges, the generated weighted adjacency matrix is symmetrical. In addition, we do not consider self-loops, which are in the weighted adjacency matrix considered by the diagonal elements. The computed weighted adjacency matrices for the individual databases are shown inFig. (S1).Fig S1: Weighted adjacency matrices for the individual datasets. The corresponding databases are (A) ACE2, (B) ALT, (C) Diabetes, (D) Inflammation, (E) Liver dysfunction, and (F) SARS. Individual contour plots show color-coded weight values between any two topics. Missing edges are presented as white squares and diagonal elements are highlighted. The color scale used for mapping colors to weight values is given on the right side of the plots.",
