Assessments of vaccine safety and anti-CVL efficacy generally require a long follow-up, stretching into years of study (Giunchetti et al., 2007, Giunchetti et al., 2008, Roatt et al., 2012). In this context, the development of methodological strategies that enable optimal evaluation of the dog's immune system would be highly relevant. Such tests could be included in clinical trials vaccine against CVL, so that the time needed for the experiments could be reduced. This would likely reduce the costs of experimentation using the dog model as well as provide a more rational way of selecting candidate vaccines against CVL.",

It is well established that macrophages participate in killing parasites through mechanisms that depend on reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. However, the mechanisms by which macrophages kill Leishmania in dogs have not been investigated as thoroughly (Rodrigues et al., 2007). The immune response against Leishmania sp. is highly dependent on the microbicidal action of macrophages, which are actually the host cell target of this protozoan; however, they have full capacity for antigen presentation and establishment of an effective response against the parasite (Pinelli et al., 1999).",

However, there is so far no standardized methodology for this purpose, and these tests usually only involve a system with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) without purified T-lymphocyte subsets (Holzmuller et al., 2005, Rodrigues et al., 2007, Rodrigues et al., 2009). The development of additional methodologies for evaluating the immune system in veterinary medicine, especially in experimental dog models, is required. Such an advance would contribute to the identification of biomarkers related to interactions between innate and adaptive immune responses of dogs. In this context, we aimed to further analyze the immune response by using standardized methodologies for a co-culture system of canine L. chagasi-infected macrophages and for obtaining purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This approach could contribute to identifying specific immune response biomarkers for developing a resistance or susceptibility profile in CVL, which could be used in both vaccine and treatment strategies against the parasite.",

A 20-mL peripheral blood sample was collected from each animal to obtain PBMCs for use in Ficoll\u2013Hypaque (Sigma Chemical Co., USA) density gradient centrifugation (Section 2.3). After the first separation on the Ficoll\u2013Hypaque gradient, the PBMCs were maintained for 24 h for adhesion of monocytes. After this period, nonadherent cells were separated into additional cultures for 4 days, for a total of 5 days in culture. At this time, lymphocytes were submitted for further purification by the same Ficoll\u2013Hypaque method. CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were isolated using magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., USA) by positive selection using anti-CD4 or anti-CD8-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) antibodies (AbD Serotec, UK) and microbeads coated with anti-FITC. Briefly, a cell suspension was prepared at a concentration of 6 \u00d7 107 cells in a 1-mL tube in isolation buffer containing PBS 1\u00d7, pH 7.2, 0.5% BSA, 2 mM EDTA). Monoclonal antibodies (CD4 or CD8-FITC) were added to 2 \u03bcL/mL of total lymphocytes, and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 15 min. Then, magnetic microbeads were added to 10 \u03bcL/mL lymphocytes and incubated for 15 min at RT. The cell suspension was loaded onto a MACS\u00ae column (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., USA), which was placed in the magnetic field of a MACS\u00ae separator. The magnetically labeled CD4+ or CD8+ cells were retained on the column. The unlabeled cells ran through, thus this cell fraction was depleted of CD4+ or CD8+ cells. After removal of the column from the magnetic field, the magnetically retained CD4+ or CD8+ cells were eluted as the positively selected cell fraction by washing the magnetic column with 15 mL of isolation buffer.",

Flow cytometric analysis was performed using canine whole blood leukocytes that were selected on the basis of their characteristic forward (FSC) and side (SSC) light-scatter distributions. Following FSC and SSC gain adjustments, the lymphocytes were selected by gating on the FSC versus SSC graph. Fluorescence was evaluated from FITC spectra (anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies) on FL1 in dot plot representations. A marker was set as an internal control for nonspecific binding in order to encompass >98% of unlabeled cells, and this marker was then used to analyze data for individual animals.

However, it is known that a variety of inflammatory conditions can generate these cells (Gerberding and Yoder, 1993). These cells were previously reported in canine macrophages in the 1970s, in the studies of Ho and Babiuk (1979), however, the cell fusion occurred only in cultures after 4 weeks. In addition, they proposed a virtually pure culture, after 10 days of culture, from which macrophages can be maintained for up to 2 months under in vitro conditions. However, it is noteworthy that the longer the duration of culture, the greater the chances of contamination by different microorganisms. Therefore, it would be helpful to standardize these cultures so that experiments could be performed more quickly. In this context, Goto-Koshino et al. (2011) described a standardized method using canine macrophages with 7 days of differentiation, for studying of phagocytic ability with latex microspheres.",

Bueno et al. (2005) attempted to optimize obtaining larger numbers of macrophages derived from canine peripheral blood monocytes, comparing results of cell cultures kept in teflon flasks separated by a Ficoll gradient. In this study after 10 days of culture, it was possible to obtain 84.17% canine macrophages. Furthermore, the rates of L. chagasi-infected macrophages after 24 and 72 h of infection were 75.93% and 76.70%, respectively. These results were similar to those of Panaro et al. (1998). However, except for the results 24 h after internalization of L. chagasi observed in the current study (Fig. 3, infection rate of 74.1%), the results obtained 72 h after infection by Bueno et al. (2005) are not in accordance with the present study. We found a gradual reduction in the frequency of parasitism and parasite load (number of amastigotes/M\u03d5) based on the time after L. chagasi infection, especially for monocytes with a longer period of cell differentiation (5 days). Thus, it became evident that monocytes differentiated after 5 days into macrophages showed greater microbicidal ability, probably due to their stage of maturation.",

However, with the exception of macrophages of 4 days of differentiation, in which enzyme levels were significantly reduced at 72 h post-infection (p\n < 0.05), the enzyme levels were similar at other times. These results are consistent with those obtained by Kausalya et al. (1996) who found the release pattern of NAG from peritoneal macrophages from BALB/c was similar, with a peak release only after 21 days post L. donovani infection. Moreover, in the study by Chakraborty and Das (1989), infection with L. donovani peritoneal macrophages from hamsters resulted in a drastic reduction in the levels of NAG during the 96 h following infection. Furthermore, the analysis of NAG levels has not been reproduced with increased dead parasites in the cell culture medium, indicating that inhibition of enzyme levels is related to the characteristics of living parasites (Chakraborty and Das, 1989). The higher microbicidal activity is closely related to the number of activated macrophages, hence with high levels of secretion of lysosomal hydrolases (Akporiaye et al., 1983). Moreover, Meagher et al. (1992) described a apoptotic neutrophils study used in addition to macrophages were not sufficient to induce high levels of NAG compared to zymosan. These data indicate that apoptotic neutrophils in the cultures at 5 days may not interfere with the secretion of the lysosomal enzyme due to the phagocytic activity of macrophages.",

Thus, using peripheral blood samples and performing CD4+ T-cell separation, increased contamination by canine neutrophils cannot be avoided. The best alternative for establishing a purification system was to carry it out on the fifth day of monocyte differentiation, when lower levels of granulocytes are present. This strategy allowed an increased performance of CD4+ or CD8+ purity level (\u226590%) using magnetic column methodology (Fig. 6).",

Based on our data presented here, we concluded that monocytes differentiate into macrophages over the course of 5 days and displayed an intermediate frequency of parasitism and parasite load 72 h after L. chagasi infection. At this time, the inclusion of purified CD4 and/or CD8 T cells in infected macrophages culture would be useful for analyzing the impact of modulation in in vitro parasitism. Furthermore, the purification system using canine T-lymphocyte subsets after 5 days of monocyte differentiation proved to be efficient for obtaining cultures permitting high CD4 or CD8 T-cell purity (\u226590%). Thus, the use of co-culture systems employing canine monocytes differentiated into macrophages and purified CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells may contribute to the analysis of the adaptive immune response in dogs. This methodology could be incorporated in vaccine and treatment studies against CVL that aim to analyze the microbicidal potential induced by specific CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells.",
