As a result, the term has become somewhat restricted in its meaning to refer to the events associated with the initial recognition of and response to pathogens by the antigenically nonspecific cells and molecules of the immune system. However, innate or nonspecific defense against infectious agents has a much older history, and the exocrine secretions of the body contain many, highly diverse humoral (i.e., soluble) factors that protect the body from the majority of potential pathogens that enter along with food and air, or by intimate contact between individuals. These are the principal subjects of this chapter.",

Evidence for this is seen in IgA-deficient subjects who lack S-IgA antibodies in their secretions and yet are not severely compromised, even though the deficiency may be partially compensated by secretory IgM or small amounts of IgG in secretions (see Chapter 64). Furthermore, innate defense mechanisms help to define the minimal requirements for successful colonization by commensal and pathogenic organisms: those that cannot adapt to these conditions will be incapable of maintaining themselves within the host. Much of the earlier work on innate defense systems in mucosal secretions was performed in saliva or milk, which are readily accessible in large quantities. However, it has become apparent that similar mechanisms operate in most secretions, although with significant differences of detail. Increased attention to the antimicrobial factors present in the genital tract occasioned by the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, for example, has revealed that this tract has multiple non\u2013immunoglobulin-based defense mechanisms (Quayle 2002).",

Most such surfaces are reinforced by the copious secretion of mucus, which is propelled by peristaltic or ciliary action and is thought to physically entrap microparticles including microorganisms; however, specific interactions between mucins and bacterial receptors may also be involved (Lichtman et al. 1996; see also Chapter 4). Furthermore, mucosal surfaces desquamate, and there is a considerable turnover of epithelial cells (estimated at 1011 per day from the human small intestine alone; Potten and Morris 1988), which, on shedding, carry with them a burden of attached microorganisms.",

            "text": "Phagocytes represent a major component of innate defense at the cellular level, and all classes of phagocytes, including macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and mast cells, occur within mucosal tissues. Some of them develop special characteristics in accordance with their location, for example, mucosal mast cells (Chapter 36) and lamina propria macrophages (Chapter 26). Although the activities of phagocytes may be largely confined to the tissues themselves, at least under normal healthy circumstances, rather than taking place within the lumen, the microenvironment close to the mucosal surface may permit phagocytic activity, as in the case of alveolar macrophages. As most secretions are hypotonic, phagocytes probably do not survive with functional activity for long in the bulk fluid phase. However, their contents may be released upon lysis or through surface degranulation and thereby contribute to the soluble antimicrobial factors in the secretions. Part of the lactoferrin and lysozyme, as well as myeloperoxidase (as distinct from salivary peroxidase) found in whole saliva or milk, for example, originates from neutrophils emigrating in the gingival crevice or in the lactating mammary gland (Moldoveanu et al. 1982). Milk, however, is isotonic, and contains variable numbers of both macrophages and neutrophils, depending upon the stage of lactation and both exogenous and endogenous stimuli. Huge numbers of neutrophils accumulate rapidly in milk in response to infection (mastitis), but their phagocytic activities are compromised by constituents of milk, particularly casein, which they ingest in competition with the microorganisms. This results in premature activation, diversion, and attenuation of the neutrophil intracellular killing mechanisms (Grazioso and Buescher 1996).",

            "text": "Innate immune recognition is mediated by a series of germ-line-encoded receptors, known as pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which detect virulent microorganisms through recognition of invariant pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Akira 2001). Of particular importance are PRRs involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) recognition and subsequent activation of signaling events. Such molecules include LPS-binding protein (LBP), CD14, \u03b22 integrins, and toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Akira 2001). Studies in wild-type and PRR-deficient mice as well as human macrophages activated by LPS, taxol, or bacterial fimbriae suggest that TLRs, CD14, and \u03b22 integrins form a functional multireceptor complex that coordinates induction of intracellular signals (Perera et al. 2001; Hajishengallis et al. 2002). TLRs constitute an evolutionarily conserved PRR family, which serves as central signal-transducing elements for induction of immunoregulatory genes that trigger innate immunity and instruct the development of adaptive immunity, and the induced regulatory and proinflammatory molecules include cytokines, chemokines, cellular adhesion molecules, and costimulatory molecules. Not surprisingly, TLRs are expressed mainly in cells that mediate first-line defense, such as neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, and mucosal epithelial cells (Cario and Podolsky 2000; Zarember and Godowski 2002).",

Indeed, at least some PRRs are naturally found in soluble form, which may have a contributory or regulatory effect on the function of the cell-associated version. A classic example is CD14, a 55-kDa glycoprotein that can be attached to the cell membrane by means of a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor and is therefore devoid of a cytoplasmic domain (Haziot et al. 1988). In addition to the membrane form of CD14 (mCD14), the molecule can also be found in two soluble forms (sCD14), one of which is proteolytically liberated from its GPI anchor (48-kDa sCD14), and a second that escapes from the cell membrane (55-kDa sCD14) (Bufler et al. 1995; Haziot et al. 1988). sCD14 can be found in serum at 2\u20133 \u03bcg/ml and in other biologic fluids such as milk, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine (Bussolati et al. 2002; Lab\u00e9ta et al. 2000; Landmann et al. 2000).",

Milk-derived sCD14 may facilitate neonatal intestinal epithelial cell responses to LPS (Lab\u00e9ta et al. 2000), but conversely, injury may be induced by LPS in renal tubular epithelial cells leading to proteinuria (Bussolati et al. 2002). In contrast to the agonistic activity of sCD14 in mCD14-negative cells, high levels of sCD14 may inhibit LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 release in monocytes/macrophages by competing with mCD14 for LPS (Haziot et al. 1994). sCD14 levels are upregulated in sepsis (Landmann et al. 2000), possibly mitigating the severity of disease, since LPS lethality in mice was diminished by recombinant sCD14 (Haziot et al. 1995).",

Human lysozyme has a higher specific activity and more potent antibacterial effect against oral microorganisms than hen egg-white lysozyme (Iacono et al. 1980). However, few species of bacteria are directly lysed by lysozyme, and other modes of action independent of its enzymatic activity have been described, including the activation of bacterial autolysins, bacterial aggregation, blocking bacterial adherence, and the inhibition of acid production by oral microorganisms (Iacono et al. 1985; Laible and Germaine 1985; Twetman et al. 1986; Wang and Germaine 1991). Moreover, cell walls of oral streptococci weakened by cleavage of peptidoglycan become susceptible to lysis by the addition of detergents or monovalent anions such as bicarbonate, fluoride, thiocyanate, and chloride, which predominate in saliva (Pollock et al. 1987). When treated with high concentrations of lysozyme in the absence of salt or detergent, Streptococcus mutans\nexhibits areas of cell wall dissolution without cell lysis (Cho et al. 1982). Its cationic property (pI 10.5) may allow lysozyme to exert bactericidal activity analogous to other cationic proteins, and although binding to oral bacteria is strongly dependent on pH and ionic strength, bacteriolysis caused by lysozyme may be physiologically significant in the oral environment where these parameters can fluctuate markedly. However, there is no clear evidence that salivary levels of lysozyme are related to the occurrence of dental caries or periodontal disease (Tenovuo 1989). Remarkably, lysozyme is reported to display inhibitory activity against human immunodeficiency virus\u20131 (HIV-1) (Lee-Huang et al. 1999).",

Although normally devoid of muramidase or antibacterial activity, a variant form of \u03b1-lactalbumin has been reported to induce apoptosis in tumor cells (Svensson et al. 2000). This variant, designated HAMLET (human \u03b1-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells), was found to be in oligomeric \u201cmolten globule\u201d conformation and could be induced by the release of calcium at low pH in the presence of oleic acid (Svensson et al. 2000). As these conditions may occur in the nursing infant stomach, the authors speculated that HAMLET could serve to protect the infant gut.

When lactoferrin is in the iron-free (apo) form, the interdomain cleft adopts an \u201copen\u201d configuration, but binding of iron (and carbonate) causes the cleft to close and become locked in this configuration (Anderson et al. 1990). One consequence of this is that the open apo form is more susceptible to denaturation and proteolytic digestion than is the Fe-bound (holo) form. Iron is released by lowering the pH, but in lactoferrin the degree of stabilization of the lobe structure is greater than in transferrin, and consequently iron release does not occur until pH \u223c3 is reached, whereas in transferrin iron release occurs at pH \u223c5.5 (Mazurier and Spik 1980). This probably explains why transferrin but not lactoferrin can donate iron to cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis.",

This is because of the presence of several surface regions with high positive charge, most notably near the N-terminus of the molecule, which in the case of human lactoferrin has four consecutive arginines at positions 2\u20135. The high pI of lactoferrin makes it an extremely \u201csticky\u201d protein, and as a result it binds readily to other macromolecules (Lampreave et al. 1990), which probably enables it to adhere to mucosal surfaces. The \u201cstickiness\u201d of lactoferrin has also hampered attempts to characterize true lactoferrin receptors. Lactoferrin-binding sites with affinities comparable with those exhibited by specific receptors have been identified on hepatocytes (McAbee and Esbensen 1991), monocytes/macrophages (Birgens et al. 1993), activated T lymphocytes (Mazurier et al. 1989), mammary epithelial cells (Rochard et al. 1992), and intestinal brush border cells. However, only the enterocyte brush border receptor has so far been cloned and functionally expressed (Suzuki et al. 2001). This, and probably many other receptors, interacts with the basic N-terminal region of lactoferrin (El Yazidi-Belkoura et al. 2001). Of particular interest is a report that activated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells express lactoferrin receptors and show enhanced in vitro proliferation in the presence of lactoferrin (Mincheva-Nilsson et al. 1997).",

Most of the proposed functions are based predominantly on in vitro studies, and in many cases the mechanisms involved are unknown.

The activity was only shown by apo-lactoferrin, and addition of iron abolished activity, indicating that inhibition of microbial iron uptake was involved. A large range of microorganisms is susceptible to this activity, including mucosal pathogens such as enteropathogenic E. coli, Salmonella spp., and Vibrio cholerae. This field has been extensively reviewed by Weinberg (2001). However, many bacteria can overcome the bacteriostatic effect of iron-withholding by lactoferrin; some secrete low\u2013molecular-weight high-affinity iron chelators (siderophores), which can remove iron from lactoferrin or possibly scavenge iron from other host sources (Brock et al. 1991), and others, notably Haemophilus spp. and meningococci, express specific lactoferrin receptors, regulated by bacterial iron levels, which allow the organism to acquire lactoferrin-bound iron (Gray-Owen and Schryvers 1996). Inhibition of growth may not be the only consequence of iron withholding by lactoferrin; in the case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, lack of iron prevents the organisms from forming a biofilm and thus making them more susceptible to other host defense mechanisms (Singh et al. 2002). In contrast, Fe-lactoferrin could inhibit binding of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans to buccal epithelial cells, whereas apolactoferrin was ineffective (Fine and Furgang 2002), suggesting that low iron levels might actually aid colonization.",

The effect can in some cases be abrogated by bacterial proteases, which presumably digest the lactoferricin peptide (Ulvatne et al. 2002). The bacterial molecules to which lactoferrin or its peptide binds vary. In S. aureus binding is to the cell wall teichoic acid (Vorland et al. 1999), whereas in E. coli it is to lipopolysaccharide (Vorland et al. 1999) and porins (Sallmann et al. 1999). In S. pneumoniae lactoferrin binds to pneumococcal surface protein A (Hammerschmidt et al. 1999), and in Gardnerella vaginalis a 120-kDa surface protein is responsible (Jarosik and Land 2000), though this may be more analogous to the iron-regulated receptors mentioned previously.",

The possibility that this activity might be caused by a contaminating milk protease bound to lactoferrin seems to be ruled out as both milk and recombinant human lactoferrin were active. In a rather similar model, lactoferrin bound to and caused proteolytic cleavage of the hemoglobin receptor of Porphyromonas gingivalis, thus preventing the organism from obtaining hemoglobin-bound iron (Shi et al. 2000). However, in this case the proteolytic activity may have originated in the bacterium as the lactoferricin peptide was also active, yet does not contain the region thought to be responsible for the serine protease activity of lactoferrin itself (Hendrixson et al. 2003).",

            "text": "Although the antibacterial effect of lactoferrin has been amply confirmed in vitro, evidence for its in vivo activity, especially clinical data, is less convincing. The facts that lactoferrin occurs in high concentration (\u223c1mg/ml) in human milk, and that breastfed babies are less susceptible than bottle-fed babies to gastrointestinal infection, suggest that lactoferrin might be an important protective factor in breast milk, but attempts to modify the gastrointestinal flora of newborn bottle-fed infants by supplementing formula milks with lactoferrin have failed to demonstrate such a role (Roberts et al. 1992). However, there is some evidence that lactoferrin can protect against bacterial infection in animal models. Experimental Helicobacter infections were ameliorated by oral administration of lactoferrin (Wang et al. 2001). This appears to be the result of the glycan moiety of lactoferrin interfering with bacterial adherence, rather than of iron deprivation. Colonization of the kidney in murine S. aureus infection was reduced by either systemic or oral administration of lactoferrin (Bhimani et al. 1999), and joint inflammation in experimental murine S. aureus infectious arthritis was reduced by local administration of lactoferrin (Guillen et al. 2000). Oral administration of lactoferrin or the lactoferricin peptide also reduced the overgrowth and translocation of enterobacteria that occurred in mice fed bovine milk (Teraguchi et al. 1995), and oral recombinant human lactoferrin reduced the severity of systemic E. coli infection in neonatal rats infected by the oral route (Edde et al. 2001). It has also been shown that lactoferrin could protect rabbits against experimental Shigella flexneri infection, through a mechanism involving inhibition by the basic N-terminal region of lactoferrin of bacterial uptake by host cells (Gomez et al. 2003). An interesting antibacterial effect of lactoferrin that clearly depends upon its iron-binding properties was reported by Schaible et al. (2002), who showed that \u03b22-microglobulin-knockout mice, which suffer from an iron overload condition similar to human hemochromatosis, became less susceptible to tuberculosis following treatment with lactoferrin. These studies in experimental animals suggest that lactoferrin might have a therapeutic effect on certain types of bacterial infection in man, and it is to be hoped that appropriate clinical studies can be devised.",

Both DNA and RNA viruses are susceptible, including cytomegalovirus, HIV, herpesvirus, hepatitis B and C viruses, rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and enterovirus 71. Lactoferrin appears to be most effective at the early stages of infection and can act either by blocking viral receptors on host cells or by binding directly to the virus itself. The molecular mechanisms involved vary. In the case of rotavirus, lactoferrin blocks entry into enterocytes by a mechanism that is independent of iron saturation but is enhanced by desialylation of the protein and can be mimicked by two tryptic peptides that do not, however, involve the lactoferricin region of the molecule (Superti et al. 2001). This also seems to be the case for anti\u2013hepatitis C activity, in which a peptide from the C-terminal region of lactoferrin binds to hepatitis C virus E2 protein and prevents interaction with the host cell (Nozaki et al. 2003). In contrast, the ability of lactoferrin to inhibit in vitro hepatitis B virus infection is dependent upon interaction with the hepatocyte rather than the virus (Hara et al. 2002). The lactoferricin region is partly, but not entirely, responsible for the ability of lactoferrin to inhibit binding of HIV to CXCR4 or CCR5 receptors (Berkhout et al. 2002).",

Lactoferrin can inhibit in vitro growth of P. falciparum (Kassim et al. 2000) and Pneumocystis carinii (Cirioni et al. 2000), in the latter case resulting from an iron-withholding mechanism. Other parasites such as Tritrichomonas foetus (Grab et al. 2001), Treponema pallidum (Alderete et al. 1988), and Leishmania chagasi (Wilson et al. 2002) possess mechanisms by which they can remove iron from lactoferrin, which might therefore be expected to enhance rather than inhibit growth.",

Another mechanism depends upon the previously mentioned ability of lactoferrin to bind to bacterial LPS (reviewed by Baveye et al. 1999). This results in impairment of LPS binding to soluble or surface CD14 on monocytes (Baveye et al. 2000b) and the subsequent production of interleukin-6 (IL-6)(Mattsby-Baltzer et al. 1996), TNF\u03b1, and nitric oxide (Choe and Lee 1999). In neutrophils, lactoferrin inhibits binding of LPS to L-selectin and subsequent production of reactive oxygen species (Baveye et al. 2000a). It also inhibits LPS-mediated IL-8 production by endothelial cells (Elass et al. 2002). This activity is mediated by the basic N-terminal region of lactoferrin (Zhang et al. 1999). In a murine model of endotoxemia, lactoferrin was found to be most effective at reducing parameters of endotoxic shock when administered 1 hour before LPS; administration of lactoferrin either 18 hours before LPS, or following the development of endotoxemia, was less effective (Kruzel et al. 2002).",

Induction of collagen-induced arthritis in mice constitutively expressing human lactoferrin was found to develop more severely than in congenic controls (Guillen et al. 2002). It was suggested that this may be the result of lactoferrin skewing the immune response toward a proin-flammatory type 1 rather than an antiinflammatory type 2 response. Lactoferrin has also been reported to act as a transactivator by upregulating transcription of the IL-1\u03b2 gene (Son et al. 2002), an activity that may relate to the proposal that lactoferrin can act as a transcription factor (He and Furmanski 1995).",

There is increasing evidence that lactoferrin may be a genuinely multifunctional protein, with iron-binding, release of basic peptides, and perhaps proteolytic activity being required in different functional scenarios. However, it must be remembered that many proposed functions of lactoferrin are based entirely on in vitro studies, and in vivo data supporting many of these are lacking. Even with extensively studied areas such as the role of the basic N-terminal lactoferricin peptides, we still do not know if such peptides are actually produced in vivo in functionally significant quantities, if at all. It is to be hoped that future research will focus on the in vivo relevance of functions based on in vitro studies, and eventually lead to clinical evaluation of lactoferrin as a useful prophylactic or therapeutic agent.",

Salivary SCN\u2212 concentration varies considerably and depends, for example, on diet and smoking habits. However, the major source of SCN\u2212 is the detoxification of CN\u2212 primarily in the liver by the enzyme, thiosulfate-cyanide sulfur-transferase, which catalyzes the transfer of a sulfur atom from thiosulfate to CN\u2212, to yield nontoxic SCN\u2212. Normal plasma levels of SCN\u2212 are 20\u2013120 \u03bcM, but in secreted fluids containing hSPO, hLPO or bLPO, the levels are much higher. Thiocyanate is found in parotid, submandibular, and whole saliva as well as in gingival crevicular and dental plaque fluids (Tenovuo 1985) and milk (Pruitt and Kamau 1991). Average concentrations of SCN\u2212 in saliva of non-smokers have been reported to range from 0.35 mM to 1.24 mM, whereas the reported range for smokers varies from 1.38 mM to 2.74 mM (Tenovuo 1985).

(1982b) showed that the concentration of SCN\u2212 in whole saliva rises on initial stimulation and then gradually declines. However, in no instance does the secretion rate of SCN\u2212 (concentration of SCN\u2212 \u00d7 secretion flow rate) in whole stimulated saliva drop below that of unstimulated saliva, indicating that the SCN\u2212 transport system is able to maintain SCN\u2212 levels despite the increased dilution resulting from stimulation. Thus, active transport of SCN\u2212 may be increased by stimulation. Active transport of SCN\u2212 into saliva may also provide a recycling mechanism for this important ion: as saliva is swallowed continuously, SCN\u2212 would be reabsorbed into the blood by the gastrointestinal uptake and concentrated again in the salivary glands.",

The cytocidal hypohalous acid oxidants can also be produced by EPO through oxidation of halides (Br\u2212, Cl\u2212, and I\u2212) in the absence of SCN\u2212. Although the hypohalous acid oxidants mediate the killing of bacteria and the extracellular destruction of invading helminthic parasites (Gleich and Adolphson 1986), these oxidants are also extremely tissue destructive (Slungaard and Mahoney 1991). However, SCN\u2212 has been shown to be the preferred substrate for both MPO and EPO, although it is present in serum in significantly lower concentrations than the other halides (Thomas and Fishman 1986; Slungaard and Mahoney 1991). This preference for SCN\u2212 results in generation of HOSCN and OSCN\u2212, which are nontoxic to human cells and tissues (H\u00e4nstr\u00f6m et al. 1983; Slungaard and Mahoney 1991; Tenovuo and Larjava 1984; Thomas and Fishman 1986). Thus SCN\u2212 protects a variety of tissues from damage that could occur as a result of peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of Cl\u2212 and Br\u2212. For example, in the reaction that accompanies the respiratory burst of leukocytes, the oxidation of the Cl\u2212 ion by MPO may generate toxic products (Weiss 1989).",

The reduction of bacterial acid production by the peroxidase system is enhanced in the presence of S-IgA (Tenovuo et al. 1982a), but this effect does not depend on specific antibodies. Although the peroxidase-mediated effects on gram-positive bacteria are merely bacteriostatic at neutral pH, gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and P. gingivalis are killed (Fadel and Courtois 1999; Shin et al. 2001). In addition to bacterial species, yeasts and many viruses (Table 5.3) are sensitive to the peroxidase\u2013SCN\u2212 systems (Pourtois et al. 1990; Mikola et al. 1995).",

The original rationale was to elevate in vivo concentrations of HOSCN/OSCN\u2212 to bactericidal levels, and although they indeed appear to increase salivary OSCN\u2212concentrations, there is no clinical evidence that they enhance the antimicrobial activity of human saliva in vivo (Tenovuo 2002). Interestingly, recent observations indicate that antimicrobial activity against mucosal pathogens can greatly be enhanced if bLPO is replaced by horseradish peroxidase (which does not oxidize SCN\u2212 at pH > 6), and iodide is used as the oxidizable agent instead of SCN\u2212 (Ihalin et al. 2003).",

For example, neutralization of stomach hydrochloric acid results in a 1000-fold reduction in the infectious dose of Salmonella typhi (Mims et al., 1995). Lactic acid (largely produced by lactobacilli) is believed to be of substantial importance in the maintenance of vaginal health and to inhibit the growth of organisms involved in bacterial vaginosis as well as HIV (see Chapter 99). Human milk contains a large number of oligosaccharides (apart from lactose), some of which are present in concentrations of up to 1\u20132 g/L, but because they are excreted intact in infants' urine, they are thought not to have significant nutritive value. Several have been found to resemble carbohydrate structures present in bacterial cell walls, for example, those of group B streptococci (Pritchard et al, 1992), giving rise to speculation that they might be able to interfere with bacterial adherence to host cells, as has been reported in the case of the adherence of E. coli to uroepithelial cells (Coppa et al. 1990). Sialyllactose and fucosylated milk oligosaccharides have also been found to inhibit cholera toxin and the heat-stable enterotoxin of E. coli (Idota et al. 1995; Newburg et al. 1990), presumably by interfering with the binding of these toxins to the carbohydrates on their receptors.",

Angiogenin-4 has now been found to be expressed by intestinal Paneth cells in mice, especially when stimulated by gut commensal bacteria such as Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Hooper et al. 2003). It is a 144-residue protein and member of the ribonuclease family, secreted along with lysozyme from Paneth cell granules, giving rise to crypt concentrations exceeding 1 mM. It displays potent bactericidal activity against gram-positives such as Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, S. pneumoniae, and the yeast Candida albicans at concentrations as low as 1 \u03bcM.

The basic and glycosylated PRPs are encoded by four genes, PRB1 to PRB4; the acidic by two genes, PRH1 and PRH2. PRPs are synthesized as precursor proteins (\u223c150 amino acids), many of which are cleaved before secretion giving rise to a large number of PRPs in saliva (more than 20 have been identified).

            "text": "Functional roles of acidic PRPs include binding to hydroxyapatite (thus becoming a part of the acquired enamel pellicle of teeth), binding of calcium ions and inhibition of crystal growth of calcium phosphate in supersaturated solutions, thereby helping to maintain tooth integrity (reviewed by Lamkin and Oppenheim 1993). All these functions are accomplished through the amino-terminal region of the molecule, which is highly acidic. The carboxyl-terminal domain of acidic PRPs was implicated in bacterial binding, especially for type 1 fimbriae of Actinomyces viscosus. This binding, which may facilitate the formation of dental plaque, happens only when PRPs are adsorbed to hydroxyapatite, not with the free soluble protein. The bound protein undergoes a conformational change in the carboxy-terminal of the molecule, exposing receptors for bacterial attachment, so-called \u201ccryptitopes\u201d (hidden epitopes; Gibbons 1990). This provides an efficient means for A. viscosus to bind to teeth without being cleared from the oral cavity. Hydroxyapatite-bound acidic PRPs also bind S. mutans and Streptococcus gordonii. S. mutans binds more strongly to the larger PRPs, and in the case of S. gordonii, the binding is localized to the two carboxyl-terminal residues (reviewed by Lamkin and Oppenheim 1993). The acidic PRPs on the tooth surface are degraded into peptides having potential defense properties by dental plaque proteolysis (Madapallimattan and Bennick 1990). A recent study showed the possible release of a pentapeptide (Arg106-Gly107-Arg108-Pro109-Gln110) having antimicrobial properties from acidic PRPs by the proteolytic activity of commensal Streptococcus and Actinomyces spp. The synthetic pentapeptide desorbed bound bacteria and counteracted sucrose-induced decrease of dental plaque pH in vitro (Li et al. 2000). PRPs from submandibular-sublingual saliva were also found to inhibit herpes simplex virus 1 replication (Gu et al. 1995) and were identified as receptors for C. albicans (O'Sullivan et al. 1997).",

Salivary mucins interact with respiratory (e.g., P. aeruginosa), cariogenic (e.g., S. mutans), and periodontal pathogens (e.g., P. gingivalis), the opportunistic yeast C. albicans, and even with HSV-1 and HIV-1 viruses (reviewed by Schenkels et al. 1996). A high\u2013molecular-weight glycoprotein (most probably mucin) complexed with \u03b1-amylase in human saliva inhibits S. mutans glucosyltransferase and may thereby contribute to the control of S. mutans colonization in the oral cavity (Jespersgaard et al. 2002).",

MUC7 D1, a 51-residue peptide derived from its N-terminus, and MUC7 20-mer, spanning residues 32\u201351 of MUC7\n(\nFig. 5.3\n), possess antifungal activities that are comparable with or exceed the antifungal activity of histatin 5 (Satyanarayana et al. 2000; Bobek and Situ 2003). These peptides are effective against the wild-type, azole-resistant, and amphotericin B\u2013resistant C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, respectively, and against Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In comparison with histatin 5, the fungicidal activity of MUC7 20-mer against C. albicans seems to be independent of fungal metabolic activity. Although it crosses the fungal cell membrane and accumulates inside the cells, mitochondria are not the targets of MUC7 20-mer in either C. albicans and C. neoformans. The 20-mer also showed potent bactericidal activity against S. mutans, S. gordonii, P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli (Bobek and Situ 2003). Other MUC7 peptides were shown to bind or to kill oral streptococci and A. actinomycetemcomitans (Liu et al. 2000, 2002). Although the MUC7 peptides are potent against a broad range of microorganisms in vitro, it remains to be determined if they are effective in vivo. Thus far, the results of two preliminary studies indicated that these peptides, as well as histatin 5, were not effective against C. albicans in animal models of candidiasis (Intini et al. 2003, and unpublished results).",

Histatins 1, 3, and 5 (\nFig. 5.4\n) are the most abundant, and they have been credited with most of the anticandidal activity, histatin 5 being the most effective (Xu et al. 1991). Histatins 1 and 3 are encoded by HIS1 and HIS2 genes, respectively (Sabatini et al. 1993); histatin 5 is a proteolytic product of histatin 3, and all the other histatins are believed to arise from histatins 1 and 3 by proteolytic processing. Besides killing the wild-type C. albicans, histatins have been found to be effective in the in vitro killing of Candida species resistant to the commonly used antimycotics, fluconazole, and amphotericin B (Tsai and Bobek 1997a; Helmerhorst et al. 1999a), as well as of C. neoformans (Tsai and Bobek 1997b) and Aspergillus fumigatus (Helmerhorst et al. 1999a).

Earlier studies showed that histatins, unlike other cationic, more amphipathic antimicrobial peptides, do not exert their antifungal action through pore formation (by altering membrane permeability leading to cell lysis). Rather, they act through a multistep mechanism, in which histatin is internalized by C. albicans, possibly through a histatin-binding protein (Edgerton et al. 1998), and targeted to energized mitochondria (Helmerhorst et al. 1999b). The killing of C. albicans is accompanied by the release of intracellular potassium ions (Pollock et al. 1984; Xu et al. 1999) and intracellular ATP (Koshlukova et al. 1999). Histatins inhibit respiration and induce the formation of reactive oxygen species in C. albicans cells as well as isolated mitochondria, which leads to cell death (Helmerhorst et al. 2001). Histatin 5 toxicity to C. albicans is concomitant with a decrease in cellular volume, closely coupled with loss of intracellular ATP, and with cell cycle arrest (Baev et al. 2002).",

Histatins inhibit hemagglutination of P. gingivalis (Murakami et al. 1990), thereby inhibiting colonization by these bacteria, and inhibit coaggregation between P. gingivalis and Streptococcus mitis (Murakami et al. 1991). Histatins also inhibit proteases from P. gingivalis (Nishikata et al. 1991), both Arg-gingipain and Lys-gingipain, as well as host matrix metalloproteinases (Gusman et al. 2001). A histatin 5\u2013derived peptide, P-113 (spanning amino acids 4\u201315), previously identified as the smallest fragment that retains anticandidal activity comparable with that of the parent compound (Rothstein et al. 2001), also shows antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus, the prominent pathogens of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (Sajjan et al. 2001). This peptide was not active in the presence of purulent sputum from CF patients, but the mirror-image peptide, P-113D (with amino acids in the D configuration) retained significant activity in the presence of sputum and thus shows potential as an inhalant in chronic suppressive therapy for CF patients. The inhibitory effect of histatin 5 on the leukotoxic activity of A. actinomycetemcomitans, which is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of juvenile periodontitis, suggests a new biologic function of histatins in the oral cavity (Murakami et al. 2002b).",

            "text": "Human salivary cystatins belong to family 2 of the cystatin superfamily, all being derived from a common ancestor (reviewed by Bobek and Levine 1992). Most (but not all) members of this superfamily are potent inhibitors of cysteine proteinases. Salivary cystatins are encoded by four related genes: CST1, 2, 4, and 5, encoding cystatins SN, SA, S, and D, respectively. Cystatins SN, SA, and S are 121\u2013amino acid proteins with about 88% identity; cystatin D contains 122 residues and shows about 55% sequence homology with the other salivary cystatins. CST1 and 4 are expressed also in a few other tissues in the body, primarily in exocrine epithelia (Dickinson et al. 2002), but little is known about the functions of cystatins in other secretions. It is proposed that salivary cystatins evolved from an ancestral housekeeping gene, CST3, encoding the ubiquitously expressed cystatin C. Potential functions of type 2 cystatins are direct inhibition of endogenous and exogenous cysteine proteinases, control of mineralization at the tooth surface, antibacterial and antiviral activities, and modulation of the immune system (reviewed by Dickinson 2002). The results of studies concerning salivary cystatin levels with respect to increased oral inflammation and periodontal disease are controversial: cystatin levels have been reported to decline, to increase, or not to change (reviewed by Dickinson 2002).",

Cystatin S did not inhibit these proteases, but was able to bind more calcium and bind more rapidly to carbonated apatite than SA or SN, suggesting that its primary role in the oral environment is likely involvement with the mineral balance of the teeth; previous findings showed cystatin S to bind hydroxyapatite and to be a major component of enamel pellicle (reviewed by Bobek and Levine 1992).

SLPI is a potent inhibitor of serine proteinase (such as human leukocyte elastase) and is also capable of inhibiting HIV-1 infectivity in vitro (McNeely et al. 1995). In salivary glands, SLPI was shown to be produced by acinar epithelial cells of both parotid and submandibular glands, to traverse the ductal system, and accumulate in the mouth. As the virus is localized to interstitial mononuclear cells within the salivary gland, it meets SLPI in the oral cavity, where the inhibitor may impede infection of additional target cells (Wahl et al. 1997). These findings suggest that SLPI may be partially responsible for the low rate of oral transmission of HIV-1. SLPI blocks HIV-1 infection of macrophages and primary T cells at concentrations (1\u201310 \u03bcg/ml) that occur naturally in saliva (Shugars and Wahl 1998), and the mechanism appears to involve blocking of uptake of HIV-1 into CD4-positive target cells through interaction with cell surface molecules other than the primary HIV-1 receptor (CD4), rather than through a direct effect on the virus replication.",

These discrepancies have been attributed to factors such as variability of macrophage susceptibility to HIV infection and to the quality of SLPI preparations. Purified and refolded SLPI protein expressed from a newly cloned synthetic gene reduced HIV-1 (Ba-L) infection in differentiated human monocytic THP-1 cells, although the commercially available preparations of SLPI did not (Shine et al. 2002). This finding warrants a thorough reinvestigation of the molecular and structural basis for the anti-HIV activity of SLPI.",

Their findings indicated that SLPI production (and also production of lysozyme, but not of lactoferrin and total protein) is diminished among healthy community-dwelling older adults, particularly elderly males, but the impact of this on the increased risk of oral disease with advanced age remains to be determined. In infant saliva SLPI has been shown to play an important role in reducing HIV-1 transmission from mother to child through breast milk of HIV-1\u2013infected mothers (Farquhar et al. 2002).",
