Hydroxychloroquine has also been used as an antimalarial, but in addition is now broadly used in autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Of note, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are considered to be safe and side-effects are generally mild and transitory. However, the margin between the therapeutic and toxic dose is narrow and chloroquine poisoning has been associated with cardiovascular disorders that can be life-threatening (Frisk-Holmberg et al., 1983). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use should therefore be subject to strict rules, and self-treatment is not recommended.",

In a nonhuman primate model of CHIKV infection, chloroquine treatment was shown to exacerbate acute fever and delay the cellular immune response, leading to an incomplete viral clearance (Roques et al., 2018). A clinical trial conducted during the chikungunya outbreak in 2006 in R\u00e9union Island showed that oral chloroquine treatment did not improve the course of the acute disease (De Lamballerie et al., 2008) and that chronic arthralgia on day 300 post-illness was more frequent in treated patients than in the control group (Roques et al., 2018). Altogether, the assessment of previous trials indicates that, to date, no acute virus infection has been successfully treated by chloroquine in humans.",

However, it should be considered carefully before drawing definitive conclusions, since no data has been provided yet to support this announcement. Results were produced in ten different hospitals and possibly from a number of different clinical protocols among those listed above, which include various designs for control groups (none, different antivirals, placebo, etc.) and various outcome primary indicators. The final interpretation is therefore technically demanding, and in the absence of published data, it is difficult to reach any firm conclusion. It will be of the utmost importance to know if the observed efficacy is associated specifically with chloroquine phosphate, or if this includes other salts (e.g., sulfate) of chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine. It is also necessary to determine if the benefit of chloroquine therapy depends on the age class, the clinical presentation or the stage of the disease.",

We urge Chinese scientists to report the interim trial results currently running in China as soon as they are available. This should be preferentially done in a peer-reviewed publication with detailed information to allow the international scientific community to analyse the results, to confirm in prospective trials the efficacy of the proposed treatment and to guide future clinical practice.",
