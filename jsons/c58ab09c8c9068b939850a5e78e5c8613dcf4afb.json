Additionally, clinical reports have indicated that PDCoV exhibits enteropathogenicity, causing severe diarrhoea and vomiting in roughly 5-to 10-day-old gnotobiotic and conventional piglets . Pathological damage to the intestine, primarily in the jejunum and ileum, was characterized by intestinal villi atrophy and shortening and was confirmed by the pathogenicity experiments Wang, Hayes, Sarver, Byrum, & Zhang, 2016) . Such changes are clinically difficult to distinguish from the pathological changes caused by the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Jung et al., 2016; Zhang, 2016) . PDCoV infections have resulted in great economic losses for the global swine industry. Therefore, fast and effective preventive measures are essential for the prevention and control of PDCoV. Currently, implementing vaccines remain the most effective means of disease control; however, there are no commercial vaccines available for PDCoV.",

Studies suggest that passive immunity is the most effective approach for protecting piglets from viral infection (Langel, Paim, Lager, Vlasova, & Saif, 2016; Leidenberger et al., 2017) . Immunized sows can transfer antibodies against enteroviruses (e.g. PEDV, TGEV and porcine rotavirus) to neonatal piglets through their colostrum and milk. The protective efficiency of passive immunization has a high positive correlation with antibody levels in the colostrum and milk (Sestak, Lanza, Park, Weilnau, & Saif, 1996) . Therefore, passive immunity of newborn piglets can be achieved by immunizing sows that produce high levels of neutralizing antibodies (NA) and transfer these antibodies through the colostrum and milk to the nursing piglets, which may be an effective means of controlling viral infection.",

Then, an inactivated PDCoV vaccine was prepared and the immune responses and protective efficiency of the inactivated PDCoV vaccine in pregnant sows was evaluated. After two doses of the vaccine, pregnant sows produced strong IgG and NA responses specific to PDCoV S proteins. High levels of IgG antibodies and NA were also detected in the serum of neonatal piglets born to immunized sows, which suggests that the antibodies were successfully transferred through the colostrum and milk. Five-day-old piglets were challenged with virulent PDCoV to assess the protective efficacy of the vaccine, and the findings indicated that the inactivated PDCoV vaccine provided 87.1% protective efficacy.",

High S-specific IgG antibody and NA responses were observed in the serum of sows post-farrowing. Interestingly, a high level of S-specific sIgA was detected in colostrum and milk, although it lasted for only a short period of time. Previous studies have indicated that sIgA was produced in the mammary gland by antibody-secreting cells and the recruitment of antibody-secreting cells into the mammary gland contribute to the production of sIgA (Wilson & Butcher, 2004) . Therefore, it has been suggested that the oral route appears to be the most effective method for eliciting a strong sIgA response when vaccinating sows (Gerdts & Zakhartchouk, 2017) . However, the findings of this study suggest that vaccination with an inactivated vaccine by injection at the Houhai acupoint in pregnant sows could also induce a strong sIgA response in the colostrum, which may subsequently provide protection for piglets against virulent challenge. Results also confirmed that vaccination at the Houhai acupoint could induce a mucosal immune response (Liu et al., 1998) . The duration of antibody persistence until the end of the experiment was monitored, and the results indicated that a strong positive correlation existed between the IgG antibody and NA responses in the serum of immunized sows.",

The IgG antibodies were absorbed by the piglets within the first 24-48 hr of life through the colostrum. In this study, a high level of IgG antibodies was detected in the serum of piglets and, more importantly, such levels displayed longterm persistence (~10 days) although piglets stopped consuming milk from immunized sows. These results suggest that IgG from the serum of sows could be absorbed into the serum of piglets through colostrum. The level of IgG antibodies in the serum of piglets (31 piglets, 10 days post-challenge) did not increase, which was due to the existing maternal antibodies in the serum of piglets interfering with an active immune response to infection. No S-specific sIgA antibodies were observed in the serum of piglets, which indicated that the function of sIgA was limited to the enteric cavity rather than the serum. The challenge assay suggested that antibodies transferred from sows through their colostrum and milk could provide protection for piglets. Four piglets born to immunized sows displayed diarrhoea post-inoculation with PDCoV strain NH, and viral RNA copies were detected in the faeces. However, compared to the mock group, the four piglets exhibited mild to moderate diarrhoea (no severe diarrhoea) and lower viral RNA copies in the faeces and intestinal tissues. Low PDCoV antigen levels were also detected in the jejunum and ileum by IHC, and minor intestinal villi damage was observed by HE staining. Collectively, these results suggest that the antibodies from sows could provide the 4 piglets with partial, but not complete, protection.",

The production of IgA in the milk of TGEV antibodies was associated with an intestinal infection, while the production of IgG was associated with parenteral antigenic stimulation. This study also indicated that the IgG response in serum, colostrum and milk was predominantly detected after pregnant sows were inoculated with virulent TGEV by intramammary injections. Moreover, the passive immunity protection was good (0% mortality and morbidity) in 3-and 4-day-old newborn piglets born to immunized sows post-challenge. However, morbidity was 100% 11 days post-farrowing with 0% mortality after TGEV challenge. These results suggest that within the first week, IgG antibodies in colostrum and milk of immunized sows could provide protection for piglets against TGEV virulent challenge. In this study, IgA antibodies were not detected in serum, colostrum or milk of immunized sows. The immunoglobulin in the antibodies was predominantly IgG, and although the piglets were no longer receiving anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies from the milk, IgG lasted ~10 days in the serum of piglets. Because of this, the immune protection response observed in PDCoV-challenged piglets born to inactivated PDCoV-vaccinated mothers was likely due to circulating anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies that were passively transferred through colostrum rather than anti-PDCoV IgA antibodies from milk, as observed previously in PEDV research (Poonsuk et al., 2016) .",

At 28 hr post-infection, piglets exhibited a range of mild to moderate degrees of diarrhoea(Table 2) (Figure 1a(A)). No vomiting or mortality was observed in the PDCoV-inoculated pigs, which differs from other reports. Dilated and thin intestinal walls were observed in piglets terminated at 48 hr post-inoculation (hpi) (Figure 1a(B)). Pigs were euthanized for pathological examinations at 24, 48 and 72 hpi. Severe villous atrophy of the jejunum and ileum was observed (Figure 1a(C) and a(D)). Negative pigs displayed no obvious lesions or pathological changes (Figure 1a(E) and a(F)). PDCoV antigens were only detected in the jejunum and ileum, not in other intestinal sections (Figure 1a(G)-a(J)). No PDCoV antigens were detected in the mock group(Figure 1a(K) and a(L)). These results suggest that the jejunum and ileum are the replication sites in the intestines, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies. Viral RNA copies in faecal swabs and intestinal tissues were detected by RT-qPCR. Viral RNA in faecal swabs increased to the maximum concentration recorded (~9.6 log 10 PDCoV RNA copies/ ml) at 72 hpi (Figure 1b). The viral levels in the jejunum and ileum were higher than in other intestinal sections(Figure 1c). These results indicate that PDCoV strain NH (P10) was enteropathogenic in 5-day-old SPF pigs and primarily replicated within small intestinal tissues.",
