            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe diseases of the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, and the central nervous system in animals (Perlman and Netland, 2009). Feline CoVs (FCoVs) have been classified into two biotypes comprising the ubiquitous feline enteric CoV (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (Pedersen, 2009). Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is one of the most frequent causes of death in young cats, and classical symptoms of effusive/wet FIP, non-effusive/dry form of FIP, or a combination of the two can develop (Berg et al., 2005). Mortality is extremely high once clinical signs appear, although some cats can live with the disease for weeks, months, or even years (Pedersen, 2014). Nevertheless, FIP is currently incurable by drug treatment, and there are no effective prophylactic vaccines. Virus replication depends on a variety of host factors (de Haan and Rottier, 2006, Vogels et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2010), which consequently represent potential antiviral targets. We have reported that cyclosporin A (CsA), a cellular cyclophilin (Cyp) inhibitor, can inhibit FCoV replication in cell culture (Tanaka et al., 2012). Although FK506 suppresses calcineurin and the nuclear factor pathway of activated T-cells (NFAT) at the same stage as CsA, FK506 did not affect FCoV replication (Tanaka et al., 2012). These data indicate that CsA does not exert inhibitory effects via the NFAT pathway. We have reported that CsA treatment caused a sustained reduction in pleural fluid volume and viral copy number in a cat diagnosed with effusive FIP (Tanaka et al., 2015). CsA is well known as a potent replication inhibitor of various human and animal CoVs (de Wilde et al., 2013, Pfefferle et al., 2011). Regarding requirements of Cyps in CoV replication, using small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments, de Wilde et al. (2011) reported that both CypA and CypB did not affect severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) replication (de Wilde et al., 2011). In contrast, human CoV NL63 replication depends on CypA but not CypB (Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2014). FK506 inhibits human CoVs, SARS-CoV, NL63, and 229E (Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2012), but each CoV requires different immunophilins as described above.",

            "text": "Cyps and FKBPs, two major families of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) that catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of the prolyl peptide bond preceding proline residues, are targets of clinically relevant immunosuppressive drugs, CsA and FK506, respectively (Siekierka et al., 1989a, Siekierka et al., 1989b). The immunosuppressive activity of these drugs is unrelated to inhibition of PPIase activity, and neither Cyp nor FKBP genes are essential (Yaffe et al., 1997). In contrast, Protein Interacting with NIMA (Pin1), a member of the parvulin subfamily of PPIases that differs from Cyps and FKBPs, is essential for cell growth and requires a catalytically competent PPIase domain (Lu et al., 1996, Lu and Hunter, 1995). Its catalytic site is unique among other PPIase enzymes because it recognizes an unusual phosphorylated Ser/Thr\u2013Pro motif in its substrates (Lu and Zhou, 2007, Lu et al., 2002, Wulf et al., 2005). Pin1 plays important roles in many cellular events, including cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, transcriptional regulation, and neoplasmic transformation. The protein has been linked to several diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and asthma (Lu and Zhou, 2007). Regarding infectious diseases, Pin1 directly interacts with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A and NS5B proteins and plays unique roles in HCV replication (Lim et al., 2011). Pin1 modulates human immunodeficiency virus type1 (HIV-1) infection by interaction with the capsid protein by uncoating and regulating APOBEC3G (Misumi et al., 2010, Watashi et al., 2008). However, there are no reports exploring the role of Pin1 in CoV replication.",

To analyze cell viability, we carried out a cytotoxicity assay using different concentrations of DTM. Treatment at concentration levels less than 50 \u03bcM did not show cellular toxicity (Fig. 3\na). When fcwf-4 cells infected with FCoV were treated with DTM, the expression of the viral N protein by Western blotting analysis was suppressed by DTM treatment compared with that by DMSO treatment (Fig. 3b). RT-qPCR analysis showed that DTM inhibited viral replication in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 1.2 \u03bcM (Fig. 3c). Using a dose of 10 \u03bcM DTM, inhibition equated to an approximately 2-log reduction compared with that of DMSO-treated fcwf-4 cells. These data show that Pin1 plays an important role in virus replication and protein expression. Additionally, we examined the effects of IFN because IFN often affects virus replication in infection. The effects of IFN-\u03c9 (50 or 5 IU) on FCoV were not significantly different from those of DMSO treated cells (Fig. 3d).

We tried to use DTM in this study which specifically inhibits Pin1 activities in vitro. DTM inhibits FCoV replication in a dose-dependent manner. These results are compatible with the results of Pin1-siRNA experiments (Fig. 3b). NFAT signals in fcwf-4 cells did not respond to ionomycin-PMA stimulation or overexpression of Pin1. These results show that the fcwf-4 cell does not respond to NFAT signals. On the contrary, overexpression of Pin1 enhanced FCoV replication. Additionally, knockout of Pin1 expression suppressed viral replication and protein expression. However, N protein expression of FCoV was not completely inhibited by knockout of Pin1 (Fig. 5a\u2013c) in this study. These data indicate that FCoV replication is affected not only by Pin1 activities but also by other host factors, such as cellular PPIases. To examine this hypothesis, further studies are needed to use multi-PPIase knockout cells by CRISPR/Cas9 system. Nevertheless, our studies indicate that Pin1 modulates FCoV replication. To date, no direct role has been reported for Pin1 which affects CoV replication.",

The N protein may participate in the discontinuous transcription of sub-genomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) because depletion of N from the replicon reduces the synthesis of sgmRNA, but not gRNA (Zuniga et al., 2010). Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of the serine\u2013arginine (SR)-rich motif which is conserved in the N-protein of mouse hepatitis virus, SARS-CoV, and FCoV. Treatment with a GSK-3 inhibitor reduces the phosphorylation of N protein and reduces the viral titer and cytopathic effects (Wu et al., 2009). In this study, we could not show which viral or cellular protein interacted with Pin1 and how the complexes regulated FCoV replication. However, Pin1 did not directly interact with the N protein or the Nsp12 protein of FCoV (CoV RNA dependent RNA polymerase) in our experiments (data not shown). We speculate that Pin1 may directly or indirectly regulate the function of GSK-3. DDX1 is a member of the DEAD-box protein family, and knockdown of DDX1 reduced the quantities of longer viral RNAs of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Wu et al., 2014). DDX1 has been identified as a member of the cellular interactomes for the IBV-N protein (Emmott et al., 2013), and an interaction between DDX1 and the non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) of IBV has been identified (Xu et al., 2010). N phosphorylation allows recruitment of DDX1 to the phosphorylated-N-containing complex, which facilitates template readthrough and enables longer sgmRNA synthesis (Wu et al., 2014). However, we do not have any evidence that Pin1 regulates GSK3 or DDX1 functions.",

Additionally, Pin1 modulates HIV-1 infection by interaction with the capsid protein in uncoating and regulating APOBEC3G (Misumi et al., 2010, Watashi et al., 2008). CsA was shown to exert inhibitory effects on herpes simplex virus (Walev et al., 1991), vaccinia virus (Damaso and Keller, 1994), BK polyoma virus (Acott et al., 2008), HIV-1 (Billich et al., 1995, Streblow et al., 1998), and HCV (Watashi et al., 2005). These reports show that PPIase has important roles in replication of various viruses, as well as influencing uncoating and viral internalization into the cell. Considering these findings, for the first time, our study has revealed the essential roles of Pin1 in FCoV replication. Therefore, our study may contribute to the development of anti-FCoV or other CoVs inhibitors.",
