Even during the 1918 influenza pandemic, the more recent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pandemic, only a proportion of individuals succumbed to infection [1, 2]. On the contrary, widespread pathogens that are innocuous for the most of the population, such as herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), can be fatal only to a very few [3]. It is now well established that host genetic variation is an important component of the varied onset, severity, and outcome of infectious disease. Such data have provided important insights into the pathogenesis of virus infections shedding light into antiviral mechanisms required for host defense.",

            "text": "Several different, yet complementary approaches to the identification of genetic variation important in infectious disease progression have been taken. By far the most common approach has been to look for association in candidate genes using case\u2013control studies. These studies have highlighted a few common, high-penetrance (see Table 1 for the definition of the terms) human genetic variants associated with infection and disease resistance due to virus receptor polymorphism. A homozygous 32 base-pair deletion in the chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5 \u039432) gene provides near complete protection against HIV-1 infection [4], whereas homozygous individuals with nonsense mutations in the fucosyltransferase 2, or FUT2, gene are almost completely protected from experimental and natural infections with norovirus [5]. In a second approach, genome-wide linkage analyses paired with candidate-gene approaches have led to the identification of rare large-effect genetic variants in susceptibility to infection against pathogens segregating in families. An excellent example is the dissection of the genetic architecture of childhood herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), a rare life-threatening complication of primary infection with HSV-1 [6]. A body of elegant studies have revealed that children with mutations in the TLR3-UNC93B-TRIF-TBK1-TRAF3-IRF3 pathway are particularly susceptible to HSE [7], due to impaired CNS-intrinsic TLR3-dependent IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb immunity to HSV-1 [8]. Candidate gene approaches, however, have been limited by their reliance on hypothesis based on\u2014often incomplete\u2014biological knowledge.\n",

            "text": "These studies have been most effective for the discovery of rare, high-penetrance protein-coding variants for presumed monogenic disorders. A recent report counted that out of about 300 primary immuno-deficiencies characterized at the single gene level, close to 1/3 have been identified by NGS in the past 5 years [27]. WES discoveries have provided fresh insights into the mechanisms that control the development, function, and regulation of immune cells during response to infection (recently reviewed in [26, 28]). Notably, they have highlighted (1) pathways that are required for general protection against infection, generally involving genetic block in the T/B-lymphocyte differentiation program or result in absence of specific immune cells, and (2) pathways that are required for response to narrow groups of pathogens, somewhat reminiscent of infection-specific risk loci mapped by GWAS. An example of the latter was the discovery of compound heterozygous mutations in IRF7 in a child suffering from life-threatening influenza [29]. Each parent was heterozygous for a single mutated allele, indicating autosomal-recessive segregation for the IRF7-deficiency. Detailed biochemical analysis indicated that both alleles were loss-of-function mutations, consistent with the mode of inheritance. Mechanistically, IRF7-deficiency was linked to both, lack of IFN-\u03b1 production in the patient\u2019s plamocytoid cells challenged with influenza virus and lack of intrinsic anti-viral immunity in patient-specific fibroblasts or pulmonary epithelial cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). This study represented the first demonstration of a genetic cause for severe influenza in humans and may well pave the way for the discovery of other influenza susceptibility genes in the IRF7 pathway, akin to mutations in the TLR3-pathways underlying HSE.",

This will dictate the selection samples (see\nNote\n1).

The exome has been defined traditionally as the sequence encompassing all exons of protein-coding genes in the genome and covers between 1 and 2% of the genome [31\u201333]. Yet this portion houses 85% of the known disease causing variants [34, 35]. An individual exome typically harbors thousands of variants, compared to a reference genome, which are predicted to lead to nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions, alterations of conserved splice site residues, or small insertions or deletions. As presented below, various methods exist to identify which variants deleteriously affect the function of individual proteins. However, each genome is thought to harbor about 100 genuine loss-of-function variants with about 20 genes completely inactivated [36, 37]. Hence, rigorous criteria, including the absence of the candidate variant genotype in individuals without the clinical phenotype together with robust experimental validation, have been proposed to validate disease-causing variants [38]. Whereas study design and experimental approaches need to be developed in a case-by-case situation, below we will present the reagents and methodology for the discovery of and validation of candidate genetic variants in a typical exome-sequencing pipeline.",

After binding to genomic DNA, these probes are pulled down and PCR amplified through the addition of adapters, allowing exon regions to be selectively sequenced. The most common and efficient strategies are in-solution capture methods offered by Roche/NimbleGen\u2019s SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library and Agilent\u2019s SureSelect Human All Exon. Several publications have compared the specificity and sensitivity of these platforms [44\u201346]. The NimbleGen\u2019s kit has the greatest bait density of any of the platforms and uses short (55 \u2212 105 bp), overlapping baits to cover the target region [46]. This approach has been found to be an efficient method to cover the target region, sensitively detect variants and has a high level of specificity. Indeed, NimbleGen\u2019s kit shows fewer off-target reads than other platforms [46]. Importantly, this bait design has been found to show greater genotype sensitivity than the other platforms in difficult to sequence regions, such as areas of high GC content [44]. The Agilent\u2019s kit is the only platform to use RNA probes. The baits are longer than those used in NimbleGen\u2019s platform (114 \u2212 126 bp) and the corresponding target sequences are adjacent to one another rather than overlapping. This design has been found to be good at identifying insertions and deletions (indels), because longer baits can tolerate larger mismatches [45].",

High-performance computing infrastructure (HPC) and IT professionals are needed to access and storage of the generated and analyzed data.

The latter is a Phred-like score [51] assigned by an algorithm of the sequencing instrument that estimates the probability that a base is called incorrectly. Several tools have been developed for QC of raw sequence data. The most commonly used is the java script FastQC [52]; it can generate diagnosis plots such as distributions of base quality scores and GC content, N content, and sequence duplication levels.

This is arguably the most crucial step and most time-consuming operation of most WES analysis pipelines. The computational challenge resides in finding an alignment algorithm that is tolerant to imperfect matches, where genomic variations may occur, while being able to align millions of reads at a reasonable speed. To achieve high-speed most alignment algorithms are based on an effective compression algorithm, the Burrows\u2013Wheeler Transformation (BWT) [53]. Many short-read aligners have been developed using this method: Bowtie [54], Bfast [55], Mosaik [56], and BWA [57]. They vary a lot in speed and accuracy, which are likely to affect the identification of structural variations and influence variant calling. BWA is the most common choice of WES alignment [58]. It allows gapped alignment, using very little memory. It performs separated alignment on both strands of a paired-end lane, in multi-threaded execution, unifying results in a single mapping file in the Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) format [47].",

These inaccurate quality scores propagate into faulty SNP discovery [51]. BQSR is a process in which machine learning tools are applied to model these errors empirically and adjust the quality scores accordingly. One of the most commonly used BQSR programs is BaseRecalibrator from the GATK suite, which takes alignment files and for each unknown base, a re-calibrated quality score is calculated to be used for variant calling. Recalibrated scores better reflect the empirical probability of mismatches to the reference genome, and by doing so provide more accurate quality scores [48, 62].",

Hence to evaluate the quality of data to discover variants with reasonable confidence, two important metrics are the breadth and the depth of coverage of a target genome. Breadth of coverage denotes the percentage of bases that are sequenced a given number of times. Depth of coverage represents the number of reads that align at a given position, which is often quoted as average raw or aligned read depth. For example, a genome sequencing study may sequence a genome to 50\u00d7 average depth and achieve a 95% breadth of coverage of the reference genome at a minimum depth of ten reads. The flagstat command from SAMtools [47] or DepthOfCoverage from GATK [48, 62] provides the calculation of the fraction of reads that successfully mapped to the reference, with number and percentages of the read mapped and unmapped.",

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Indels are detected where the reads collectively provide evidence of variation (see\nNote\n2). As with alignment tools, several open source tools are available to identify a high-quality set of variants in WES projects [63]. SAMtools [47] and GATK HaplotypeCaller [48, 62] are widely used in genomic variant analyses. HaplotypeCaller has been found to have high sensitivity for SNP detection and outperform other pipelines for Indels [50, 63]. HaplotypeCaller runs a \u201creading window\u201d along the reference genome, comparing the reference to sequenced reads counting mismatches and Indels. These variations from the reference are used as a measure of entropy, or disorder in the read data. If the level of entropy within the reading window surpasses a cutoff score (default value can be changed), the window is marked as an Active Region, which is inspected to generate the plausible haplotypes. Then, HaplotypeCaller uses a Bayesian statistical model for the calculation of the probability of the genotype, estimating the accuracy of the call with a score of Phred-like quality. The results are reported in a standard Variant Call Format (VCF) file.",

            "text": "Annotation of disease-causing variants involves determining (1) the effect they have on the protein-coding sequence, including synonymous and non-synonymous changes, stop-gained or stop-lost, consensus splice site changes for SNPs, frame-shift or other structural impacts on transcript structure for Indels, (2) the frequency of the variant in the population, as disease-causing variants are expected to be rare.Three major tools are used to classify variants functionally: SnpEff (SNP Effects) [64], VEP (Variant Effect Predictor) [65], and ANNOVAR (Annotate Variation) [66, 67]. SnpEff annotates variants based on their genomic location and predicts coding effects [64], as does VEP, a tool available from the genome browser, Ensembl [65]. Besides annotating functional effects of variants with respect to genes, ANNOVAR has many additional functionalities, such as integrating information from up to 4000 different databases and external resources to annotate the variants [67]. For SNPs , these include (1) calculating their predicted functional importance scores using SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) [68] and PolyPhen2 (Polymorphisms Phenotyping v2) [69] and (2) reporting their conservation levels by PhyloP (Phylogenetic P-values) [70, 71] and GERP++ (Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling) [72]. The CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion) database is another useful external linked for deleterious prediction of a variant. The CADD score combines information from several resources to score both protein-altering and regulatory variants [73].New tools are being developed for variant annotation that considers gene-level metrics (e.g., conservation at the gene-level, accumulation of mutational load) and provides more sensitive scoring of variants [74]. GAVIN (Gene-Aware Variant INterpretation for medical sequencing) classifies variants as benign, pathogenic, or a variant of uncertain significance [75]. The MSC (Mutation Significance Cutoff) [76] generates a quantitative score that provides gene-level and gene-specific phenotypic impact cutoff values above which a variant is considered pathogenic with 98% true positive detection rate.To determine variant frequency, ANNOVAR links to external databases such as dbSNP database [77, 78] or the Human Gene Mutation Database [79] to identify the presence or absence of a variant (see Table 4 for commonly used databases of human genetic variation). Large-scale genomic studies such as 1000 Genomes Project [36], the US National Institutes of Health\u2013National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NIH-NHLBI), ESP6500 exome-sequencing project [80], and the Exome Aggregation Consortium [37, 81] have catalogued sequence variants from thousands of exomes and genomes, which serve as a valuable resource for allele frequency estimations. These resources are integrated in ANNOVAR, which can find the alternative allele frequency for newly discovered variants in a WES project. The GATK pipeline also integrates ANNOVAR as an external option for variant annotation and can use the tool VariantAnnotator, which is enriched with additional features such as gene set enrichment analysis for downstream analysis.\n",

The tool assigns scores (VQSLOD for variant quality score log-odds) which can be used to set the filtering of \u201cbad\u201d variants. There is tradeoff in the process in which increasing the specificity will decrease the sensitivity of the filtering. VQSR can be applied to SNPs or indels. The availability of in-house databases for WES variants obtained with the same sequencing technology and analysis pipeline is recommended to exclude variants resulting from systematic errors (see\nNote\n3).Under the assumption that common variants are less likely to cause disease than rare ones, it is important to set a minor allele frequency (MAF) threshold based on disease model of the study. A variant with a MAF greater than 1% is regarded as common; the remainder are considered rare or private to the subject or the kindred studied. Setting the MAF threshold at 1% is recommended, usually filters out over 70% of the variants [83].\n",

            "text": "At this point the output is a subset of high-quality, low-frequency, predicted pathogenic variants, which require customized filtering process depending on the disease trait. The more information gathered both on (1) the phenotype and (2) the gene in which the variant resides, the greater the likelihood to accurately assess the functional significance of a variant.A deep knowledge of the clinical and cellular phenotype , the prevalence of the trait in the general population together with an understanding of the familial segregation are essential in the prioritization of gene variants. For example, a recessively inherited disease variant is likely homozygous whereas a dominant disease variant is heterozygous. In general, a dominant allele should be absent in a variant database based on healthy controls or exceedingly rare to allow for reduced penetrance. However, there can be exceptions to these rules. For instance, recessive disease variants can be compound heterozygous. In a cohort, the search for either identical variants or additional rare variants in the same gene can further strengthen the evidence for causality. Variants found in a gene in which other variants have already been associated with a certain phenotype are more likely to be associated with the same phenotype, although this is not always the case.Segregation of the variant with disease status is another key criterion for variant prioritization. This requires appropriate WES control data obtained with the same method from healthy subjects, ideally of the same ethnic origin as the patients. In case of complete penetrance, the candidate disease-causing variants found in patients cannot be present in unaffected subjects. In case of incomplete penetrance, the situation is more complex because these hypothetical disease-causing variants can also be present in asymptomatic subjects, including unaffected subjects of the same pedigree.At the gene level, it is reasonable to first review variants found in genes that participate in its related pathways . This is also true when a phenotypically similar disease exists, and related pathways are known. The HGPS (Human Gene Connectome) ranks genes by their biological distance to core genes (known to be associated with phenotype), and provides the distances and all possible biological connections between all pairs of human genes based on protein-protein interaction prediction [74, 84]. Genes can be mapped online to KEGG (Kyto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways [85] or REACTOME pathways [86]. It is useful to find information about candidate genes-knockout phenotypes. For this, the Mouse Genome Informatics database enables queries for human\u2013mouse disease and MPO (Mammalian Phenotype Ontology) connections using gene symbols as an input [87]. Expression of candidate gene in the tissues or organs of interest is an important criterion for prioritization . GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) profiles [88], the ExA (Expression Atlas [89], and the BioGPS gene annotation portals [90] are excellent resources for this purpose. Knowledge about protein structure, function, and interactions also can help rank candidate genes. The UniprotKB (Uniprot knowledgebase) collects information from several databases including curated protein sequences and structures with links to annotations of genomic variants [91]. The STRING database and associated search tools [92] are powerful resources for identifying interacting partners of a candidate gene\u2019s product or for identifying interactions between the products of a set of genes that bear functional variants. The ToppGene [93] and GeneMania [94] web portals are other resources that perform candidate gene prioritization based on the interactome.\n",

We can also improve variant calling in regions with fewer reads by utilizing reads from multiple samples concurrently. This increases the confidence of any given variant and allele bias and strand bias are much easier to sort.The evaluation of family trios can also eliminate low-quality variants as the majority of variants detected in the child and absent from the parents most likely result from sequence artifacts.
