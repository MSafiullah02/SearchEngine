Many countries have implemented measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission and to prevent health facilities from being overwhelmed by demand for hospital care, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and ventilator therapies needed to treat severe infections.

Most African countries implemented airport closures, curfews, lockdowns, and other social distancing measures in March or April 2020 (WHO, 2020) . However, infectious disease surveillance and reporting infrastructure remains highly underdeveloped in many African countries, and COVID-19 testing is limited given the shortage of human resources and appropriate laboratory facilities. In addition, projections of COVID-19 case burden predict that most African countries will experience an uptick in total and severe COVID-19 infections in the next one to three months (CDDEP, 2020) .",
