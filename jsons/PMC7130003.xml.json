In France, a plan to fight bird flu with vaccine orders and the description of an apocalyptic vision of the next flu epidemic was observed. Indeed, Marseille was supposed to reserve 700 beds in case of a flu epidemic! This terror was justified by the memory of the Spanish flu, although we now know that most of the patients died as a result of bacterial infections [3] and the fact that, as with any infectious disease, from the beginning the first detected cases are only the severe and fatal cases. With regards to H5N1, which is one of the infectious poultry agents that cause large epidemics\u2014despite its discovery in 1997, of only 650 cases diagnosed in humans, 60% died [1]. This led to a dramatization, with vaccine orders and the creation of experimental models to try to predict when a mutant may become transmissible between humans and transform this zoonotic disease into a human disease [4].",

This prospective survey in Egypt over 3 years on 1000 people showed that when H5N1 was endemic, 2% of the exposed population had antibodies compared with 0% of controls, and when the epidemic H9N2 appeared in poultry, seroprevalence increased from 0 to 5.6% and 7.5%, all asymptomatic infections. In total the zoonotic variant of H5N1 avian flu and H9N2 is very common in people in contact with poultry; it is banal and most of the time, asymptomatic.",

Experimental models may well confirm certain elements but cannot predict the severity, as seen with H1N1 and as we still see with H5N1 [5]. Transmissibility in the ferret probably has no relationship to transmissibility in humans, in which the virus is probably passed mainly through inanimate objects and hands. It is necessary to regain some common sense for respiratory viruses. It is plausible that the Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) coronavirus problem is of the same nature and that only a subpart of the population respond with a clinical infection, perhaps because of genetic characteristics or environmental parameters.",
