In this study, we tested in 401 COVID-19 patients for viral RNAs in both respiratory and rectal specimens, and tracked for more than 7 weeks to present a clear elucidation of the oral and fecal viral shedding profile, such as the duration, viral load, and relationship to patient symptoms.

The SARS-CoV-2 has a strong transmission capacity in children, but the clinical presentation of COVID-19 was generally milder in children than adults 6, 7 . Therefore, viral diagnosis in stool specimens is crucial in the diagnosis and Notably, we found that SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples remained for an unexpected long period, with higher positive rate and higher viral load than the paired respiratory samples. The longest duration observed was 43 days, much longer than the usual 3-5 weeks from symptom onset to discharge for most patients 4 , suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 test of rectal swabs is crucial to minimize false negatives for the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, and to reduce the potential fecal-oral transmission from asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. An obvious difference in the interval from illness onset to antiviral therapy was observed, raising the possibility that early 7 antiviral treatment might reduce SARS-CoV-2 persistence within the intestinal tract.",

Viral RNAs of SARS-CoV-2 were tested by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in both the respiratory and rectal specimens. The results were further analyzed in combination with clinical data. Patients were divided into severe and non-severe group based on the disease severity defined according to China National Health Commission Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection (seventh version) 5 . The study was approved by the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen Ethics Committee (2020-105). Further details are shown in Supplementary Methods. Results Positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in rectal swabs lasted for 7 weeks 1758 rectal swabs from 401 COVID-19 patients were collected during 0 to 98 days after illness onset (Median, 33; IQR, 23-52). Grouping the rectal samples according to the collection time-point, qRT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA showed 44.19%, 30%, 16.67%, 12.29%, 12.3%, 5.22%, 0.76% and 0% positive for 1~7 week after illness onset (W.A.O) and > 7 W.A.O, respectively (Figure 1A). Associating the sample testing results to the individual patients, altogether 80 out of 401 (19.95%) COVID-19 patients, including 32 males (40%) and 48 females (60%), were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the rectal swabs (Table S1), suggesting the collection time (W.A.O) of the rectal swabs affects the testing result. Pediatric (< 18 years-old) patients possessed a positive rate of 56.67%, compared to 16.98% in adult (\u2265 18 years-old) patients. The demographics and clinical characteristics were comparable between fecal viral RNA negative (N=321) and fecal viral RNA positive (N=80) patients (Table S1). Paired fecal and respiratory samples showed more positive cases and higher viral load in rectal swabs than respiratory samples Respiratory and rectal samples collected at the same day were defined as a pair, and 517 pairs were collected from the 80 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in rectal swabs. 58 (11.8%) pairs were double positive, 112 (21.7%) pairs were positive in rectal while negative in respiratory samples, 40 (7.7%) pairs were positive in respiratory while negative in rectal swabs. Most of the pairs with only rectal positive were found within 4 W.A.O (",

Paired samples collected at the same day with double positive results were used for the comparison, and higher Ct values indicated lower viral loads. The pairs with higher viral loads in the nasal swabs were marked in red. Supplementary Methods Patients A total of 401 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in our hospital were included in this study. Each patient had at least one rectal sample tested for viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical information was collected retrospectively through Hospital informational system (HIS). 1758 rectal swabs from 401 COVID-19 patients were collected during 0 to 98 days after illness onset. Paired respiratory and rectal samples were collected at the same day from the same patient for patients confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their rectal swabs. A total of 517 such pairs of samples were collected. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) Throat swabs, nasal swabs, sputum and rectal swabs were collected from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases upon admission and thereafter. The sample collection time was further divided into 8 groups based on the disease progression, including the 1 st week after illness onset (W.A.O), the 2 nd W.A.O, the 3 rd W.A.O, the 4 th W.A.O, the 5 th W.A.O, the 6 th W.A.O, the 7 th W.A.O and later (> 7 W.A.O). Viral RNAs were extracted from clinical specimens using the QIAamp RNA Viral Kit (Qiagen, Heiden, Germany).
