HFRS in Korea, China, and areas of Asia east of the Ural Mountains is caused primarily by two hantaviruses, Hantaan virus and Seoul virus (Lee, 1999). Hantaan virus, carried by the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius), is seen primarily in rural areas and associated with a more severe form of disease, with a mortality rate ranging from 1.5% to 12% in Korea (Lee, 1991, Bruno et al., 1990, Kim et al., 2006). Seoul virus, carried by domestic rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus), is responsible for urban cases of HFRS. Seoul virus is generally associated with a less severe form of disease, with a mortality rate of less than 1%.",

Individuals are at greatest risk for hypertension, pulmonary edema, and complications of renal insufficiency during the oliguric phase, resulting in dialysis in approximately 40% of HFRS cases due to Hantaan and 20% cases due to Seoul virus. Causes of death are mainly due to complications of renal insufficiency, shock, or hemorrhage.",

In 1987, intravenous (IV) ribavirin was made available on protocol as an investigational drug for treating HFRS in Department of Defense (DoD) medical treatment facilities (control group was not deemed ethical based on decreased mortality reported in the China study). The clinical experience with IV ribavirin for treating HFRS acquired in Korea from 1987 to 2005 was reviewed to assess (1) the clinical course of HFRS treated with IV ribavirin and (2) the safety profile of ribavirin for treating HFRS.",

A decrease in mortality was observed in ribavirin-treated subjects [2.5% (3/125) versus 8.5% (10/117) in non-ribavirin treated controls], which was a sevenfold decrease in mortality when adjusted for baseline variables (dialysis not available in this study). The mechanism by which ribavirin prevented death was most likely due to prevention of oliguria, as 12 of the 13 deaths were associated with prolonged oliguria. While the antiviral activity of IV ribavirin may be due to multiple mechanisms, recent data suggest ribavirin may exert its primary activity against Hantaan virus by serving as a RNA virus mutagen resulting in an \u201cextinction catastrophe\u201d error, as a result of incorporation in the viral RNA genome (Huggins, 1989, Chung et al., 2007).",

However, in a cohort comprised of Republic of Korea (ROK) military troops (mainly young adult males) hospitalized on mean day 4 of illness with HFRS at a medical referral center with dialysis capability and experienced clinicians between 2000 and 2004, oliguria was observed in 24/61 (39%) and dialysis was required in 23/61 (38%) individuals (Kim et al., 2006) (Table 7\n). The time of onset of symptoms to admission was similar in the oliguric and non-oliguric groups. Most individuals who developed oliguria (21/24 (87.5%)) subsequently required dialysis: only 2 of 37 (5.4%) non-oliguric persons required dialysis.

A trend toward an increased platelet count and a decrease in hemorrhagic manifestations of disease was observed in ribavirin-treated HFRS patients compared to non-ribavirin treated controls (Huggins et al., 1991). Thrombocytosis attributed to ribavirin was observed in rhesus macaques with Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) treated with IV ribavirin (McKee et al., 1988). Studies suggest the mechanism for the increased platelet count was stimulation of platelet production, based on the increase in megakaroctyes and ploidy observed in ribavirin-treated macaques. As aggregation studies suggested platelet function was normal, an increase in normal-functioning platelets could result in a potential hemostasis benefit in HFRS.",

The occurrence of a 25% or greater reduction of the hematocrit in 75% individuals in this cohort was higher than observed in the China ribavirin-treated cohort (observed in only one-third of HFRS subjects receiving IV ribavirin) (Huggins et al., 1991), but similar to cohorts receiving IV ribvirin for hantapulmonary syndrome (HPS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Chapman et al., 1999, Chapman et al., 2002, Chiou et al., 2005, Knowles et al., 2003, Muller et al., 2007, Koren et al., 2003, McEvoy et al., 2004). The anemia was well tolerated in this HFRS cohort comprised of mainly young healthy adults. However, ribavirin should be used with caution in individuals with medical conditions such as coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure (CHF), where anemia may not be tolerated.",

Bradycardia in HFRS has been reported in numerous publications, occurring in 19\u201373% of individuals with HFRS from the four hantaviruses causing HFRS and most commonly during the oliguric and polyuric phases (between days 9\u201313 of illness) (Amitina, 1962, Pimenov et al., 2002, Puljiz et al., 2005, Katetanovic et al., 1992). Other cardiac abnormalities reported with HFRS include nonspecific cardiac conduction abnormalities, atrial fibrillation, junctional bradycardia, first and second degree atrioventricular (AV) block, premature atrial and ventricular contractions, sinus tachycardia, depressed left ventricular function, and myocarditis (Markotic et al., 2002, Puljiz et al., 2005, Chun and Godfrey, 1984, Pal et al., 2005, Basin et al., 1992, Liu et al., 2002, Katetanovic et al., 1992, Pimenov et al., 2002). While EKG abnormalities have been reported in 30/79 (38%) cases of HFRS acquired in Croatia (either from Dobrava or Puumala viruses), electrolyte and metabolic disturbances were not found to be statistically different in patients with abnormal EKGs (Puljiz et al., 2005). Autopsy reports demonstrating cardiac findings of hemorrhage and edema (mainly in the right atrium) and mononuclear cell infiltrates (mainly in the left atrium but throughout the heart) (Lukes, 1954, Hullinghorst and Steer, 1953, Kessler, 1953) suggest cardiac abnormalities may be a direct effect of the hantavirus.",

Patients with SARS receiving IV ribavirin were not at increased risk for pancreatitis or elevated pancreatic enzymes on a multivariate analysis, although elevated amylase levels (not pancreatitis) occurred more frequently in a univariate analysis (Muller et al., 2007). Hyperamylasemia and pancreatitis were observed in both seronegative and seropositive individuals given IV ribavirin for possible HPS, suggesting either enrollment bias or a drug induced etiology (Chapman et al., 1999, Chiou et al., 2005).

The ethical concerns for performing a second placebo-controlled trial may also be addressed by this study, as death rates in this cohort were similar to non-ribavirin treated HFRS cohorts in Korea with dialysis availability, suggesting dialysis may prevent deaths related to severe renal insufficiency that were possibly prevented by IV ribavirin in the China study. The main adverse event from IV ribavirin was reversible hemolytic anemia, which is common and may be severe. The association of ribavirin with adverse events of hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperuricemia, pancreatitis, and bradycardia is unclear, as these abnormalities are also complications of HFRS. This study supports the need for a randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess IV ribavirin in treating HFRS and to support FDA approval of the drug.",
