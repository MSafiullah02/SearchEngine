Current laboratory analyses support correct diagnosis in over 70 % of all diseases and can be used to aid the continuous monitoring of drug therapy [4]. Traditional diagnosis system in central laboratory is therefore a vital component in the clinic and in local general practice. However, classic diagnostic technologies are not completely well suited to meeting the expanded testing requirement because they rely on complicated sample purification and sophisticated instruments which are labor-intensive, timely, and expensive and require of well-trained operators. One of the main challenges for industry is to develop fast, relatively accurate, easy-to-use, and inexpensive devices. For example, microscopy observation requires less infrastructure and is more widely available based on the simplicity and low cost; however, the accuracy is somehow questionable and underutilized (e.g., smear tests for tuberculosis, malaria, and schistosomiasis) [5\u20137]. As a result, it not only increases the cost and inconvenience of health care but also causes patients to leave the medical system before the diagnostic result is obtained [8]. Faster and more accurate diagnostic tests that require minimum laboratory equipment and operation training play an important role in expanding health care in resource-constrained settings [9, 10].",

The concept of POC testing is mainly for the patient, so short turnaround time, minimum sample preparation and reagent storage and transferring, user-friendly analytical instruments, and digital or visible quantitative or semiquantitative single readout is required [4, 12, 13]. It is clear that on-site or minimum sample preparation and on-chip storage limit the delays that caused by transport and preparation of clinical samples. As a result, shorter turnaround time leads to rapid clinical decision-making and may save fatal consequences. No previous knowledge in sample analysis should be required, so elders can perform the tests at home with minimum training to improve health outcome [14].",

The fundamental principles of the LFIA continued to be refined through the 1980s and were firmly established during the ensuing years [18, 19]. Since that time, at least another 500 patents have been filed on various aspects of the technology.

However, to entirely evolve the lateral-flow test, considerable enabling technologies were still required. Many of these technologies, such as nitrocellulose membrane manufacturing, antibody generation, and processing equipment, were developed throughout the 1990s.

When a test is run, appropriately conditioned sample is added to the proximal end of the strip, the absorbent pad. The treated sample then migrates to the conjugate pad, where an appropriate reagent has been immobilized. The labeled reagent on the conjugate pad can be colloidal gold, or a colored, fluorescent, or paramagnetic latex particle. These specific biological components can be either antigen or antibody depending on the assay format. Next, the sample remobilizes the dried reagent, and particle interaction ensues. Sample and reagent then migrate to the next segment of the strip, the reaction matrix. The reaction matrix is a porous membrane, upon which a final specific biological component has been immobilized. These biological components are usually proteins, either antibody or antigen. They have been bound onto the specific lines of the membrane being used. As the sample and reagent reach this line, they are captured by the applied proteins, and excess liquid moves past this point and is taken up by the absorbent pad. The result is the detectable absence or presence of the test line, read by eyes or by other instruments.\n",

Direct assay is usually used when testing for larger analytes with multiple antigenic sites, such as hCG, dengue antigen, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A positive result is indicated by the presence of a test line. The conjugated particles also reach and are captured at the control line. The control line typically comprises a species\u2013specific anti-immunoglobulin antibody, specific for the antibody in the conjugate pad. Competitive assay is usually used when testing for small molecules with single antigenic determinants that cannot bind to antibodies on a test line simultaneously.

Adsorptive capacity decreases with the molecular weight of the protein [33]. To maximize adsorption, antibodies and other proteins should be applied to the membrane in buffers that are preferably free of salt, surfactants, and sugars.

However, the complex sample preparation using liquid\u2013liquid extraction or solid-state extraction, time-consuming detection processes, bulky size of equipment, and power sources requirement confined the possibility of on-site tests. There are some commercial portable oral fluid test devices that have been developed and available on market providing satisfactory detection ability to achieve the requirement of detection limit of certain drugs. One of the successful commercial examples for on-site drug test is Oratect. It is a LFIA-based test utilizing AuNPs for colorimetric sensing. In order to collect oral fluidic samples, sample collector is combined in a single device [47].",

The capture of nucleic acids can be performed in an antibody-dependent or antibody-independent way. For example, in an antibody-dependent system, an anti-biotin antibody immobilized on the surface of nitrocellulose is used to capture biotin- and carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-bearing oligonucleotides in RPA amplicons [51]. Binding is subsequently detected using an anti-FAM-colloidal gold conjugate. An antibody-independent alternative utilizes streptavidin as the binding agent. Immobilization of oligonucleotide probes directly onto membranes is also possible using oligonucleotides linked to carrier proteins.",

At least 30 previously unknown disease agents have been identified since 1973, including HIV, Ebola, hepatitis C, and SARS. In chronic diseases, there remains significant growth, particularly in the areas of inflammation, cardiac markers, and cancer, with a myriad of new labels in development in the search for improved diagnostic and prognostic indicators.",
