The equipment and infrastructure are often limited and doctors are forced to select which babies will be admitted and offered facilities such as ventilators.4 Few state-owned centres are equipped with neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and these are scattered across the country. Thus, in developing countries we are dealing with neonates with completely different demographic characteristics. Whereas the minimum gestational age of live-born babies managed in a NICU in developed countries is \u226425 weeks with birthweights as low as 300 g, the average gestational age of live-born babies in developing countries is \u226530 weeks with birthweights \u22651000 g. In a study on anthropometry and body composition of south Indian babies at birth, the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) birthweight of all newborns was 2.80 \u00b1 0.44 kg.5 Financial constraints in developing countries limit the use of technical interventions, due to which very few neonates undergo invasive medical or surgical procedures, unlike reports from developed countries.",

Semi-automated and automated culture systems are available only in a handful of tertiary care centres. The cost of providing these services to patients is borne by the family and is often prohibitive; most clinicians treat patients empirically. Microbiological results are particularly important in neonates as signs of sepsis are often non-specific. Hence, while financial constraints are difficult to resolve, we still have the option to utilize cost-effective, alternative interventions such as infection control, which by reducing the incidence of infection will decrease the overall morbidity and mortality in sick neonates. Successful field trials for home-based neonatal care have already been reported.2 We need to extend these achievements to healthcare settings.",

Membrane protective IgA is missing from the respiratory and urinary tracts, and unless the newborn is breast-fed, is absent from the gastrointestinal tract as well. On a cellular level, there is decreased ability of leukocytes to concentrate where necessary. These leukocytes are less bactericidal and phagocytic. At the humoral level, the newborn has low or non-existent levels of the immunoglobulin antibodies IgM, IgE and IgA. The neonate is born with IgG antibodies acquired from the mother. However, it is important to note that passive transfer of maternal antibodies does not take place till 29 weeks of gestation. This has implications for preterm infants born 25\u201329 weeks of gestation; they are susceptible to infection despite the mother's antibody status. There is a slow rise of immunoglobulin levels after 3 months of age to levels of older children.",

Infection with drug-resistant organisms plays a significant role in the outcome of HAI in all patients, irrespective of their gestational age and underlying condition. Hospitalization leads to colonization of the skin and gastrointestinal tract with resistant flora found in hospitals and subsequent bloodstream infection, when the skin or mucosa is abraded. Studies have reported that administration of prophylactic antibiotics to neonates can increase the incidence of HAI with drug-resistant pathogenic micro-organisms. About 64.8\u2013100% of neonates presenting with HAI had received prior broad-spectrum antibiotics.16, 30, 54\n",

In contrast, the predominant organisms isolated from invasive neonatal infections in technologically advanced countries are Gram-positive cocci (coagulase-negative staphylococci, Group B streptococcus).95 The reason for this difference is probably multifactorial and could be due to gestational age of the babies involved, the use of invasive devices (central vascular catheters and shunts), ambient moisture, humidity and the prevalent flora in the unit. Evidence supporting these risk factors has been discussed elsewhere in the review and probably merits further evaluation.",

Although the source of C. albicans infection in the NICU is often considered to be endogenous, molecular typing studies have shown that nosocomial transmission of C. albicans is the predominant mode of acquisition.26, 96 The nosocomial acquisition of C. albicans is related to cross-contamination via the hands of healthcare workers or parents and the use of contaminated equipment. 26, 97 In one study, retrograde medication syringe fluids were significantly more likely to be contaminated with candida than other fluids being administered to the infants (P\n < 0.001). Candidaemia was significantly associated with total parenteral nutrition (P\n = 0.04) and retrograde medication administration (P\n = 0.02).98 Central vascular catheters, steroid administration, endotracheal intubation and H2-blockers have also been reported as risk factors for systemic fungal infections in neonates.66, 82 Other risk factors include prematurity, low birthweight and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.36 Complications of candidaemia such as endocarditis and uveitis have been reported in neonates. The onset of endocarditis was related to persistant candidaemia. Fungal endocarditis was present in 13.7% neonates with persistent disease (>5 days of candidaemia) and 3.7% patients with non-persistent disease (OR: 4.19), while uveitis developed in 3.4% patients. Mortality in neonates with persistent disease was comparable to the mortality in neonates with non-persistent disease.81\n",

In these situations kangaroo care provided by the mother has emerged as a cost-effective and widely accepted style of caring for an infant in hospital. In a study from India, there was significant improvement among the kangaroo care group compared with the conventional group, in terms of hypothermia (10/44 vs 21/45, P\n < 0.01), higher oxygen saturations (95.7 vs 94.8%, P\n < 0.01) and decrease in respiratory rates (36.2 vs 40.7, P\n < 0.01). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of hyperthermia, sepsis, apnoea, onset of breastfeeding and hospital stay in the two groups.125 Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of kangaroo care and the incidence of HAI in neonates.",

In a setting where most physicians are reluctant to use first-line agents, due to misleading or lack of sufficient susceptibility data, a qualified microbiologist is indispensable. Communication between microbiologist and neonatologist helps in deciding the most probable pathogen and in initiating the most appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The formulation of a mutually agreed antibiotic policy at community, institutional and national levels is imperative.",

In turn, it is mandatory that microbiologists balance their focus equally on diagnostic as well as clinical microbiology. Microbiological influence and involvement can be enhanced if the microbiologist joins regular clinical ward rounds and helps to raise awareness among healthcare professionals regarding all aspects of infectious disease management. Education and training is an important remit of the ICT. Besides training of healthcare staff we believe it is important to provide training to empower the mother. As the main carer in the family her education is vital; if she can be made aware of the rationale behind the microbiologist or neonatologist's advice, she will be in a stronger position to participate in the wellbeing of herself and the baby.",
