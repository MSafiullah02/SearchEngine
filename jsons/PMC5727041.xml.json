            "text": "During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, poliomyelitis, an acute viral disease, caused the paralysis of hundreds of thousands of children1. The introduction and widespread use of effective vaccines in the 1950 s and 1960 s led to a dramatic reduction in polio-related Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP). Since the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988, more than 2.5 billion children have been vaccinated with a corresponding decline of over 99% in the annual wild poliovirus (WPV) incidence2. Despite this impressive progress, tackling the last one percent of polio cases has been challenging3. In addition to the failure to reach pockets of unvaccinated children due to conflict, religious beliefs and social upheaval4, other factors might help virus circulate in the environment5, but their effects are poorly understood. The large scale geographic variation in incidence and frequent historical spillover of WPV from regional strongholds to countries believed to be polio-free highlight the urgent need to identify local conditions conducive to ongoing transmission6. An understanding of the covariates of poliovirus incidence is also important for risk management in countries that have been declared disease-free.",

Often, these patterns contain the clues needed to identify key risk factors. Assessing the variation in the magnitude of disease outbreaks and their geographic consistency with respect to these factors\u2013an approach referred to as spatial epidemiology\n8\u2013is necessary for characterizing infectious disease dynamics at the global scale5,9,10. In recent years, spatial epidemiology has been used to explore the dynamics of SARS11, whooping cough12, foot-and-mouth disease13, rotavirus14, pandemic influenza15, and polio16. Studies of polio, however, have focused almost exclusively on vaccination policies, using either predictive statistical models17\u201319 or dynamic models of transmission20,21. A quantified picture of regional disease patterns and their spatially extended macroecological determinants is still missing. To bridge this gap, we performed a comparative study, investigating a wide range of potential predictors of polio incidence at the national level. We were particularly interested in identifying the drivers of poliovirus persistence in the environment. Our results show that there is not a singular \u201cpolio epidemiology\u201d or social syndrome hampering elimination, but rather that the conditions supporting persistence vary from place to place and require local knowledge to identify and overcome.",

Statistical models were used to compare covariates from across demographic, social, and environmental categories of putative causation. First, we studied factors known to drive the replenishment rate of the population susceptible pool. These included vaccine uptake and demographic factors such as the per capita birth rate and population density22. Second, we considered potential feedbacks between health, infectious disease transmission and poverty23 by quantifying the relationship between polio incidence and per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Since the polio virus is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, we supposed that exposure of infectious virus particles to external environmental conditions may be important. Thus, we also considered factors conjectured to affect viral persistence and exposure risk, particularly changes in land use, climate, and indicators of sanitation and hygiene24,25.

Thus, in addition to analyses that focus on local determinants of incidence, we also evaluated polio regional persistence. Specifically, we examined the Critical Community Size (CCS)26, which is the theoretical threshold population size above which an infectious disease persists strictly through local transmission27\u201329. In practice, it has been found that the realized CCS is determined by a combination of the susceptible influx rate26 and mobility among communities30. To assess the effect of spatial coupling on the extinction rate, we compared the extinction profile of polio in non-island and island countries. Together, these analyses document the effects of a combination of factors, including socio-economic, demographic and environmental conditions, on the frequency and amplitude of polio incidence. We highlight the conditions that might be favorable for poliovirus transmission. This is crucial especially in the absence of detected AFP cases and the silent circulation of poliovirus. This work paints a global picture of the changes in polio incidence over the past four decades. It reveals a virus whose transmission dynamics and regional persistence defy a simple explanation and are instead determined by an ensemble of factors.",

In some countries, such as Burkina Faso, Mali and Afghanistan, a threshold in unvaccinated births was identified by segmented regression models, below which there was little change in polio incidence (see Supplementary Fig. S5). These findings highlight the expected combined effects of vaccination coverage and population demography in modulating population-level poliovirus circulation. We note, however, that a threshold in unvaccinated births was not detected in all countries, suggesting that the variation in country-specific incidence cannot be explained by unvaccinated births alone. There must therefore be additional factors underlying this heterogeneity.\n",

A subsequent ANOVA performed on the residuals of the fitted model showed that the variation in polio incidence that could not be explained by per capita GDP, is significantly related to vaccination (P-value < 0.001), providing evidence of a combined effect of income and vaccine uptake (Table 1).\n\n",

We also examined the out-of-sample predictive ability of our fitting procedure. For all four countries, the out-of-fit predictive accuracy of random forests models was low, with wide prediction intervals and small R\n2 values of 0.003, 0.001, 0.16 and 0.44, respectively (Fig. 5). For one-step-ahead predictions, as the number of training points increased, the prediction accuracy improved, with narrower prediction intervals. Finally, to examine the reliability of our modeling approach as a forecasting algorithm, we contrasted its performance against linear regression models (see Supplementary Fig. S9). For the fitted data, random forests models better captured the fluctuations in the data (linear regression: R\n2 = 0.74, 0.78, 0.33 and 0.91, respectively for Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and India). For the out-of-fit and one-step-ahead predictions, linear regression models also performed poorly (see Supplementary Fig. S9).

The regional heterogeneity in disease incidence is described by a combination of demographic, socio-economic and environmental factors.

There is a disproportionate burden of infectious diseases on poor nations23, whose poverty has, in turn, stymied efforts to interrupt polio virus transmission33. In addition to the obvious impact of poverty on health infrastructure and access to vaccines, there is a high proportion of the unvaccinated settlements due to vaccine refusals and missed children34 or due to violence and fear caused by the insurgency in endemic countries35. Among these countries and other low income countries, it also has been shown that oral poliovirus vaccines (OPVs) exhibit lower immunogenicity compared with high income countries36,37. This has presented a major challenge to the global eradication of polio. In low income settings, uncontrolled urban growth may also accelerate overcrowding and lead to inadequate waste-water management, sanitation and public health provisioning, living conditions that are conducive polio virus transmission38. Polio cases have been found in both rural and urban settings. Higher incidence in urban areas may arise from overcrowding39, while in urban-rural populations it may be additionally due to lack of hygiene and health service facilities40.",

We obtained similar results even after fitting a single random forests model to all countries combined as a check against possible idiosyncrasies of this approach (see Supplementary Fig. S7). The importance level of per capita GDP for the single random forests model was higher than percent forest cover. However the random forests model fitted to each country separately explained the variance in the data better than the single model (See Supplementary Table S2 and Table S3). Surprisingly, percent forest cover had a positive association with polio incidence (see Supplementary Fig. S11). Forest cover was also negatively correlated with the percentage of people with access to improved sanitation and population density. Accounting for these linkages, we speculate that a higher percent of forest cover in low income countries indicates lower urban development, which may lead to more fragmented public health infrastructure hindering attempts at controlling poliovirus circulation. In addition, we suggest that low percentage of arable land and constrained agricultural growth in most of these poor countries (see Supplementary Fig. S11) may be due to shortage of water supplies and poor agricultural infrastructure. Such limitations can lead to food shortage and malnutrition, which weakens the population resistance to an infection, given exposure38. Prevalence of reported cases of polio is higher among vaccinated children with high levels of malnutrition. Poor immunity from malnutrition could lower the efficacy of OPVs and consequently promote vaccine-derived polio outbreaks41,42. Also in addition to malnutrition, the oral vaccine failure can be related to shorter duration of breast-feeding in early childhood43.",

Additionally, however, our study also reveals that polio persistence is affected by geography. In particular, higher persistence is observed in non-island communities compared to islands, consistent with other infectious diseases50. This may be due to lower spatial coupling in isolated (island) communities leading to less frequent epidemic recolonization and higher overall rates of regional extinctions, compared with non-island populations. Therefore, for the same population size and unvaccinated birth rate, island populations experience higher rates of polio extinction51. Thus, long-term polio persistence results from the combined effects of geographic isolation, population demography and vaccine coverage. Especially vaccination affects the structure of disease fade-out. Due to lack of data, we did not consider SIAs in our analyses. In general, higher SIA coverage would be expected to reduce polio persistence.",

First, we have implicitly assumed reporting to be consistent through time and we have ignored possible geographic variation in vaccination coverage and disease surveillance both in country and subnational levels52,53. Under-reporting of disease incidence leads to an over-estimation of polio extinction frequency, especially in countries with inadequate public health provision and weak surveillance systems. Poor countries with large unvaccinated birth cohorts will report too frequent absence of disease. These limitations induce biases in our analysis. Additionally, for detailed bookkeeping of the susceptible population size, it would be essential to consider additional parallel data on supplementary immunization activity (SIA)54,55, vaccine type and composition. Quantification of these factors would serve to improve the association between vaccine coverage and incidence across countries. Also, as previously demonstrated56, an assessment of the vaccination history of children not vaccinated during SIAs would help identify the possible pockets of susceptible individuals. In addition, accounting for the geographic variation in quality of conducted SIAs could help describe the heterogeneity in incidence data. Undoubtedly, access to better resolved auxiliary data would help clarify the ecology and the complexity of this important disease system. Although the accuracy of model predictions is limited by the available data, we submit that our analyses on the determinants of polio disease spread and maintenance can give insights into the design of immunization campaigns.",

Our study indicates that in addition to the poor immunization status, polio persistence resulted mainly from the convergence of environmental, demographic, and socio-economic factors. Addressing the linkage between each of these drivers and polio incidence is necessary to prevent future outbreaks by controlling the polio transmission in a region and also by increasing the efficacy of vaccines. Unbroken chains of poliovirus transmission in any country pose a threat to all countries. There are many small areas within endemic countries where the virus is still present and where surveillance is weak. By linking the knowledge of these areas and their demographic and environmental characteristics to the strategic solutions, the Polio Programme will succeed34. In addition, the importance of social data in driving improved performance of the Polio Programme and sound decision making has been frequently emphasized by Independent monitoring board of GPEI34. Determination of dominant covariates of polio incidence, would be one step forward towards selection of the right information to make proper decisions. Accordingly, it is expected that specific cases would benefit from the effort required to develop a refined country-specific model accounting for dominant covariates of polio incidence. In addition, recognizing the spatial and temporal incidence patterns has considerable power to help unmask transmission dynamics. In particular, our large-scale comparative approach demonstrated the complexity and heterogeneity among the determinants of polio transmission, shedding light on the intricacies of transmission and the importance of a holistic perspective for effective disease control.",

The best style is chosen based on the two indices: the goodness of variance fit measure (GVF), and the tabular accuracy index (TAI)62. The best method for our data with higher GVF and TAI values was the Jenks natural break. Jenks maximizes the similarity of numbers in groups by minimizing each class average deviation from the class mean, while maximizing each class deviation from the means of the other groups. The Jenks natural break provides a uniform interface to finding class intervals for continuous numerical variables63.

            "text": "To rank the predictors of polio incidence for each country, we used Random Forests, a machine learning algorithm that trains an ensemble of classification and regression trees and votes their collective predictions. For datasets with many input variables each containing a small sample size, a single tree classifier will have accuracy perhaps only slightly better than random. Combining trees grown using randomly selected features can improve accuracy by minimizing overfitting and producing unbiased estimates of modeling errors60,67,68. The model-free approach of machine learning algorithms like random forests enables higher predictive accuracy with assumptions concerning the relationships between predictor and response variables as well as data distribution69. In our study, taking into account our sample size and the number of predictors with high correlations among them, we used the algorithm implemented in the \u2018randomForest\u2019 package in R. In this implementation, each tree is constructed using a different bootstrap sample from the original data. About one-third of the data are left out of the bootstrap sample and not used in the construction of the tree. For each of the bootstrapped samples, the candidate predictors of polio incidence are randomly sampled, the variable providing the most information among samples is chosen at each node of a small decision tree, and the process is repeated70. Growing large numbers of trees does not overfit the data, and random predictor selection diminishes correlation among unpruned trees and keeps the bias low by taking an ensemble of unpruned trees68. To compute the generalization error, the data which are not in the bootstrap sample, called out-of-bag (OOB) data, are used at each iteration. We computed variable importance as the average increase in Mean Square Error (MSE) of predictions, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\Delta $$\\end{document}\u0394 MSE, when OOB data for the variable are permuted while all others are left unchanged67.

Here, random forests models first were trained using the data from 1980\u20132000 and then tested with the incidence data in 2001. Next, the data from 2001 (one observation) were added to the training set (1980\u20132001) and the incidence of the next upcoming year (2002) was predicted. This process continued systematically until we had predicted polio incidence in all years up to our final year of data (2015).

Thus, extinction risk is higher in small populations and/or those with low birth rates compared with large populations and/or high birth rates. However, recently, a novel contributory mechanism has been proposed: the metapopulation \u201crescue effect\u201d50. This effect reflects the relative differences in spatial coupling, and hence potential recolonization, among highly connected (mainland) and isolated (island) communities. To characterize regional persistence of polio, we plotted the proportion of years with no reported cases of polio against the actual number of unvaccinated births (as defined above) averaged over 35 years (1980\u20132014). We contrasted polio persistence in islands with non-island settings. Island countries were identified according to Wikipedia (see the Supplementary Materials). Australia was regarded a non-island country. A generalized additive model with integrated smoothness estimation was fitted to these data. We also examined the local persistence of polio as a function of per capita unvaccinated births and fitted a segmented regression model to identify potential thresholds.",
