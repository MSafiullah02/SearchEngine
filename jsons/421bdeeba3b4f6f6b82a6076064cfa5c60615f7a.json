As a result of their unique mechanism of action, they are more effective and less toxic treatment option and their clinical usage is increasing. While they are more commonly used, various adverse effects have been observed including lifethreatening ones, including anaphylaxis. The aim of this review is to distinguish the anaphylaxis from other hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) and provide a management algorithm for the anaphylactic reactions induced by biological agents. Recent Findings Many case reports and series have been published regarding anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions (concerning cytokine release syndrome, acute infusion-related reactions) due to biologic agents. Although acute treatment of HSR varies according to the clinical presentation, desensitization with the drug is the major management option for subsequent administrations in the case of anaphylactic reactions. Summary Anaphylaxis and other immediate onset hypersensitivity reactions are occasionally difficult to differentiate from each other, and mixed-type reactions may be observed. Immediate management of anaphylaxis includes discontinuation of infusion, immediate administration of adrenaline, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and other treatment options depending on the symptoms. After 30-120 min of the reaction, a blood sample for serum tryptase levels should be obtained and after 4-6 weeks skin testing with the culprit drug should be performed for decision of long-term management via either graded challenge or desensitization.",

In addition to common symptoms, patients may display atypical clinical features such as rigor, back pain, and abdominal pain.

CRS is caused by the release of cytokines especially TNF-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, and interleukin-6 from monocytes, macrophages, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells [16, 17] . Not only monoclonal antibodies but also non-protein-based cancer drugs, stem cell transplantation, graft-versus-host disease, and severe viral infections can cause CRS. The manifestation of CRS varies from flu-like symptoms to severe lifethreatening conditions such as renal failure, cardiac dysfunction, and capillary leakage with pulmonary edema. In some cases, death has been reported. The respiratory system is commonly affected, and the manifestations vary from cough and tachypnea to acute respiratory distress syndrome depending on the severity of reaction [18, 19] . Treatment of CRS depends on the severity of the reaction. For mild and moderate reactions, management includes slowing the infusion rate (after a temporary break) and premedication with corticosteroids and acetaminophen. Severe reactions are usually clinically indistinguishable from IgE-mediated reactions, and management is similar to anaphylaxis [13\u2022].",

Commonly, IgE-mediated reactions to drugs occur after a sensitization phase with multiple exposures to the drugs. A few exceptions have been reported on anaphylaxis during first administration of mAbs. Preexisting IgE antibodies against galactose-\u03b1-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) have been identified as the underlying cause of first-dose anaphylaxis for cetuximab and infliximab. Alpha-gal is an oligosaccharide which is found in mammalian meats and Fc fragment and Fab portion of cetuximab heavy chain, Fc fragment of infliximab, and a few other monoclonal antibodies. Lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) bitten patients develop IgE antibodies to alpha-gal. Therefore, first dose of cetuximab or infliximab may cause anaphylaxis [23, 24] . Bueren et al. showed that only alpha-gal present on the Fab domain of cetuximab binds to alpha-gal-specific IgE antibodies of sensitized patients in vitro and no binding to alpha-gal-specific IgE of other alpha-gal containing monoclonal antibodies, basiliximab, palivizumab, zalutumumab, panitumumab, and abatacept or the Fc fragment of cetuximab [25]. However, theoretically, patients sensitized to alpha-gal may experience anaphylaxis to the first dose of biologics which have alpha-gal motif in Fc fragments. Two cases of anaphylactic reactions during the first dose of basiliximab have been reported, but their alpha-gal IgE levels were unavailable [26] . In addition to that, first-dose anaphylaxis to omalizumab has been reported due to polysorbate which is a solubilizing agent used in drugs to stabilize emulsions [27, 28] . Other additives of biological agents such as mannitol, albumin, polysorbate 80, latex, papain, and trometamol may have antigenic potential [29] .",

After evaluation of the airway, breathing, circulation, and removal of the allergen, which means immediate cessation of the infusion, first-line treatment is intramuscular administration of adrenaline. If the patient has no response to adrenaline within 5-10 min, intramuscular adrenaline should be repeated. Secondline and third-line treatments consist of oxygen, adequate position, nebulized adrenaline, nebulized beta-2-agonist, intravenous normal saline, corticosteroid, and antihistamine administration depending on the clinical presentations of the patient [6, 21] . Serum tryptase levels should be obtained 30-120 min after the reaction to differentiate anaphylaxis from infusion-related reactions and cytokine release syndrome. The severity of organ involvement such as cardiovascular symptoms is correlated with higher serum tryptase levels. Although elevated serum tryptase levels from baseline suggest mast cell activation, in some cases of anaphylaxis, serum tryptase levels may be within the normal range [30, 31] .",

Desensitization protocols are available not only for intravenously administered agents but also for subcutaneously and orally administered biologic agents. A desensitization protocol of dasatinib, an orally administrated tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been reported recently for delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions [51] . For adalimumab and etanercept, which are subcutaneously administered monoclonal antibodies, six or seven-step desensitization protocols have been defined. The initial dose is administrated as 1 mL of 1/100 dilution of the routinely administrated concentration, and the next doses increase at each step as 0.5-2-fold doses of the previous one with 30min intervals [36, 52] .",

Second generation antihistamines which have longer half-lives can be given since reactions during desensitization usually occur in the last two steps [42, 58] . Based on the severity and clinical findings of the initial reaction, additional drugs may be administered before the initiation of desensitization. Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids can be used to avoid fever and pain. Patients who experienced bronchospasm can take montelukast and corticosteroids. Also, montelukast and aspirin can be administered to prevent flushing. Low-dose benzodiazepines may be useful to treat anxiety during the desensitization [12\u2022\u2022, 39, 58] . The reactions occurring during the desensitization can be treated with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and acetaminophen depending on the symptoms. Slowing down the infusion rate or an additional dose of antihistamine at the beginning of the previous step of the one where the reaction occurred should be performed at the following desensitizations. In spite of these procedures, if a reaction occurs during the desensitization, reducing the total targeted dose might be considered [12\u2022\u2022, 13\u2022] . Also, prophylactic normal saline infusion (100 cc/h along the first 11 steps and 250 cc/h along the last step) can be used to prevent cytokine release syndrome during the desensitization [12\u2022\u2022] .",

These observations can suggest that patients suffering from an autoimmune disease may have an increased risk of HSR.

Their complex structures and content of variable amounts of foreign regions may lead to HSRs. Although anaphylaxis is not the most common form of HSR, it may limit the clinical usage of biologic agents. Acute management of anaphylaxis to biologics is similar to that applied to other causes of anaphylaxis, but subsequent administration of the drug remains as a problem to be solved. If the drug is first-line treatment option or more effective than other drugs, desensitization can be performed under supervision of an experienced allergist. Nevertheless, further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of hypersensitivity reactions to increase safety and efficacy of biologics.",
