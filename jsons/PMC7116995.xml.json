Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis, which are respectively host-adapted to cattle and people, are recognized as being among the most pathogenic species. Cryptosporidiosis, refers to infection with Cryptosporidium spp., and is primarily characterized by villus atrophy and fusion, intestinal crypt inflammation, and a resultant malabsorptive, maldigestive, osmotic diarrhea. C. parvum infection typically occurs in calves less than 1 month old and impacts calf morbidity and mortality (O\u2019Handley et al., 1999). Infected calves shed large numbers of readily infective oocysts in their feces which impacts environmental parasite loading (Nydam et al., 2001).",

Naturally infected calves experience diarrhea, have a mean onset of fecal oocyst shedding of 16.3 days, and a mean duration of fecal oocyst shedding of 10.5 days (O\u2019Handley et al., 1999).

Thirty calves were purchased at birth from a local dairy farm and enrolled in the study as they were born. Control calves (n\n = 3) were enrolled concurrently with test calves (n\n = 30). At least one study author attended all calvings. The perineum of the dam was thoroughly cleaned with povidone\u2013iodine scrub and calves were delivered onto single-use plastic sheets to prevent manure contamination. Immediately after birth, a physical examination was performed and an identification tag was placed in the right ear. All calves were fed 4 L of \u226550 g IgG/L commercial colostrum replacer (Bovine IgG, Colostrum Replacement, Land O\u2019Lakes Inc., St. Paul, MN) within the first 4 h of life via an oroesophageal feeding tube in order to replicate conventional calf management on commercial dairies as best as possible. Commercial colostrum replacer was fed instead of colostrum in order to minimize variability between calves, to limit potential pathogen exposure, and to provide adequate passive transfer of immunity without providing anti-Cryptosporidium specific antibodies. The calves were then transported from the source farm to Cornell University.",

In brief, feces were collected from naturally infected 6- to 14-day-old calves from a separate commercial dairy operation and processed by continuous-flow differential density flotation. They were stored until needed at 4 \u00b0C in suspension with 100 U of penicillin G sodium per ml, 100 mg of streptomycin sulfate per ml, and 0.25 mg of amphotericin B per ml. The oocyst DNA was genotyped as C. parvum by sequence and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis via amplification of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene in a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described previously (Jiang et al., 2005). In brief, the primary PCR step amplifies a fragment of approximately 1325 base pairs, whereas the secondary PCR step results in a fragment of approximately 823 base pairs. In the primary PCR, the following forward and reverse primers were used, respectively: 5\u2032-TTCTAGAGCTAATACATGCG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCCATTTCCTTCGAAACAGGA-3\u2032.

The immunofluorescence procedure was modified from the kit instructions. Briefly, a 0.10 g portion of feces was mixed into 10 ml of PBS (pH = 7.4) in a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube. Then, 100 \u03bcl of the mixture was removed and 5 \u03bcl of Merifluor immunofluorescence antibody reagent was added. The solution was vortexed and incubated in the dark at room temperature for at least 30 min and stored at 4 \u00b0C until examination. Following incubation, 10.5 \u03bcl of the sample was placed on a slide and covered with a coverslip. The 20\u00d7 objective on a fluorescent compound binocular microscope (460\u2013490 wavelength fluorescent compound binocular microscope Olympus BX41, Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA) was used to count the number of oocysts observed. The number of oocysts observed in 10.5 \u03bcl was then multiplied by 10,000 to give the number of oocysts per gram of feces. This count was standardized by the dry weight percentage. Dry weight analysis of fecal samples was obtained by taking a 10\u201320 g portion of each original fecal sample, drying it at 108 \u00b0C for a minimum of 24 h (Thermolyne Mechanical Oven, Barnstead International, Dubuque, IA), then weighing it directly (Precision Standard Scale, Ohaus Corporation, Pine Brook, NJ) (Bellosa et al., 2011).",

Post hoc analysis of the percentage of fecal scores \u22653 across the dose groups was carried out with Dunn's Post Test. Analysis of variance was used to assess differences in fecal oocyst counts across dose groups. Simple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between individual explanatory variables and diarrhea (percent of fecal scores \u22653) as well as onset of fecal oocyst shedding. Explanatory variables having P\n \u2264 0.1 were selected for analysis using multiple linear regression. Manual backward-stepwise regression was used to remove explanatory variables and their interactions from the model when P > 0.05. The ID50 for fecal oocyst shedding, diarrhea, and fecal oocyst shedding with diarrhea was estimated using linear regression analysis. The percent of dosed calves that shed oocysts in their stool, developed diarrhea, or both was compared with the total number of calves receiving each dose of oocysts (log transformed) (DuPont et al., 1995).

We have determined that in neonatal dairy calves the ID50 of C. parvum is 16.6 oocysts, depending on which clinical definition of infection is applied. This dose is orders of magnitude less than the number of oocysts typically shed into the environment by naturally infected calves, which has been reported to be in excess of 3 \u00d7 1010 oocysts in a calf that sheds oocysts for 6 days (Nydam et al., 2001). In our current study, calves that received the lowest doses of C. parvum oocysts began fecal oocyst shedding later, and this was associated with fewer days of diarrhea. Given that C. parvum is prevalent in dairy calves, ubiquitous in the environment, and very difficult to kill, its control poses a challenge to dairy farmers (Fayer et al., 1997, Trotz-Williams et al., 2005, Trotz-Williams et al., 2007). In the fecal\u2013oral transmission cycle, knowing that small levels of exposure can result in a large amount of fecal oocyst shedding, and not knowing exactly how many oocysts a calf is exposed to on any given day, poses the greatest challenge for control. However, it is very likely that calf exposure greatly exceeds the ID50 we have reported. Therefore, findings from this study suggest that unless C. parvum is completely eliminated from the environment, it will be very difficult to reduce the incidence of cryptosporidiosis.",

A study of healthy human volunteers reported an average onset of fecal oocyst shedding of 9 days (DuPont et al., 1995). We found an inverse relationship between onset of fecal oocyst shedding and dose. Calves that received smaller doses began shedding later, which was also found in a prior study (Zambriski et al., 2013). Likewise, a DuPont et al. (1995) report a relationship between onset of fecal oocyst shedding in people and size of oral inoculum, i.e., at higher doses, infection tended to occur sooner and last longer. Other studies in calves and people have reported different relationships between duration of fecal oocyst shedding and dose (DuPont et al., 1995, Moore et al., 2003). In a study by Moore et al. (2003), an association between dose and duration of fecal oocyst shedding is reported. In that study, 32 of 75 calves died, and among the 8 calves necropsied, all were found to have co-infection with Salmonella spp., rotavirus, and coronavirus, in addition to C. parvum. Therefore, it is possible that the relationship reported between dose and duration of fecal shedding was influenced by co-infection. In the study conducted in healthy human volunteers challenged with C. parvum, a non-statistically significant relationship was reported between dose and duration of oocyst excretion, but the authors do not discuss possible reasons for this association. With respect to enteric symptoms, Moore et al. (2003) report an inverse relationship between onset of diarrhea and duration of diarrhea in calves, and DuPont et al. (1995) report a relationship between dose and occurrence of enteric signs. Our study found a positive relationship between dose and diarrhea, but in the final model, onset and cessation of fecal oocyst shedding were found to be better predictors of diarrhea. This can be explained in part by the parasite life cycle and associated pathology of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Calves that shed sooner or longer, may be more likely to experience a longer auto-infective stage, or may experience more and recurrent villus damage over time, both of which could result in a longer time to recovery and healing of the GI tract and a longer and more severe episode of diarrhea.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to report this information in calves. In other species, the reported ID50 of C. parvum is also very low. In outbred neonatal CD1 mice it is 79 oocysts, and is as low at 60 oocysts in wild-type neonatal mice (Finch et al., 1993, DuPont et al., 1995). Immunosuppressed Mongolian gerbils become infected when challenged with 100 C. parvum oocysts (Baishanbo et al., 2005). In healthy human volunteers, the ID50 is reported to be 132 oocysts, but infections occurred at all dose levels, including 30 oocysts (DuPont et al., 1995). For infection with C. hominis in healthy human volunteers, the ID50 is estimated to be 10\u201383 oocysts (Chappell et al., 2006). Our study findings are consistent with those reported by other researchers, and again illustrate the point that the dose of C. parvum oocysts required to induce illness and fecal oocyst shedding is relatively low compared to the environmental load.",

The degree of fecal oocyst shedding associated cryptosporidiosis is dramatically disproportionate to the ID50 of C. parvum, which contributes to environmental loading and infection of subsequent calves. This study showed that calves receiving a lower dose began to shed oocysts later, and this was associated with less diarrhea. However, while these calves fared better from a clinical perspective, there was no difference in the log-total or log-peak oocysts counted/g of feces across all doses, meaning that regardless of the level of exposure, the degree of environment loading is unaffected. Therefore, the best method of controlling cryptosporidiosis is to prevent exposure entirely, however, in settings where this is not feasible, keeping exposed calves clean, dry, and nourished will minimize the impact of disease on calf health and wellbeing (Ollivett et al., 2012).",
