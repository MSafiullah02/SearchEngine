In developed countries, about 4% of older adults have been diagnosed with asthma and another 4% have been diagnosed with COPD, but the prevalence is doubled for each of these chronic respiratory diseases when objective tests are performed. COPD has become the fourth leading cause of death in some developed countries. COPD onset occurs almost exclusively in older age due to the cumulative effects of cigarette smoking in genetically-susceptible individuals. An upper respiratory viral infection commonly leads to the initial diagnosis of asthma at any age. About half of older adults with asthma have allergic triggers, compared to about 90% of asthmatic children. Exacerbations with dyspnea, wheezing and cough are the major morbidity of asthma and COPD, which limits activity, reduces quality of life and increases health care utilization and costs. In older adults as in younger adults, the most effective prevention for both asthma and COPD is smoking cessation.",

An older adult with any of these diseases is more likely to experience morbidity (exacerbations and hospitalization) and mortality. Asthma and COPD both cause airway narrowing, which can be detected by spirometry testing. While asthma can start during any decade of life, COPD only develops after decades of cigarette smoking and so is very rare before 40 years of age. It is important to distinguish between asthma, COPD and heart failure because the interventions differ; treatment for asthma is more successful and the prognosis is much better. About 20% of older adults with any one of these causes of dyspnea will also have one of the others (co-morbid conditions).",

Asthma is de fi ned as episodic and reversible airways obstruction. COPD is de fi ned as chronic and irreversible airways obstruction. Other chronic conditions can also cause dyspnea. We de fi ne two of these here to distinguish them from asthma and COPD. The de fi nition of chronic bronchitis is based on a history of a chronic cough (productive of sputum or not) which has been present for at least 2 years. Epidemiologic studies use a standardized set of questions to de fi ne chronic bronchitis; no objective tests are needed. Emphysema is a term used to describe the irreversible destruction of lung tissue, which is detected using a breathing test called carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) or by highresolution CT scans of the lungs that show reduced lung density or holes in the lungs (blebs or bullae). Overlap amongst the above chronic lung disease phenotypes does occur since decades of cigarette smoking can cause any one or all of them (asthma, chronic airway obstruction, chronic bronchitis and emphysema). spirometer mouthpiece as quickly as possible for at least 6 s. The volume of air forcefully exhaled during the fi rst second is called the forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and the total amount of air exhaled is called the forced vital capacity (FVC) (measured in liters). Healthy middle-aged adults can exhale about 75% of their air in the fi rst second, so the ratio of their FEV1/FVC is about 0.75. Smokers who have developed COPD have a permanently reduced capacity to exhale rapidly, so their FEV1 and their FEV1/FVC fall below the lower limit of the normal range (LLN).",

However, the LLN for this ratio has been controversial. The pulmonary function standards committee of the American Thoracic Society [ 2 ] -the largest and most in fl uential pulmonary professional societyrecommends using the fi fth percentile LLNs from spirometry reference equations from the healthy, never-smoking subset of participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III for use throughout North America [ 3 ] . The mean and LLN for the FEV1/FVC from this study (and from most studies of lung function in healthy population-based samples) decrease with aging. So the LLN for this ratio is about 0.75 for young adults and falls to about 0.60 for adults \u00b3 85 years of age ( Fig. 24.1 ). In the year 2000, an industry-sponsored, international group of key opinion leaders published and began extensive worldwide promotion of a COPD clinical practice guideline which de fi ned COPD as a FEV1/FVC ratio <0.70 (a fi xed threshold) after inhaling a fast-acting bronchodilator (post-BD). Many COPD guidelines developed for individual countries quickly adopted this de fi nition. However, compared to the use of an age-adjusted LLN, the use of this fi xed threshold to de fi ne COPD greatly increases the apparent prevalence of COPD in population-based samples of healthy older adults [ 4 ] . The vast majority of patients given a diagnosis of COPD in clinical settings present with symptoms; however, in population-based studies which included spirometry, half of adults with severe airway obstruction did not report respiratory symptoms. Therefore, epidemiologic studies with spirometry should base the COPD prevalence only on spirometry results.",

Therefore, in epidemiological surveys, participants with mild asthma usually have normal spirometry tests (no airway obstruction).

Due to COPD, her FEV1 is only 0.35 l (very severe airway obstruction) and she has required continuous oxygen therapy (2 l per minute to maintain her oxygen saturation above 90%) during the past decade. Note the nasal prongs which deliver the supplemental oxygen. She kindly gave us written permission to publish this 2012 photo of her classi fi ed by some studies as having asthma and by others as having COPD. Asthma has to be de fi ned on the basis of a physician diagnosis, but in the future, there should be some consideration of a reversibility of chronic obstruction. Some investigators use smoking status to classify the respiratory disease of those with post-BD airway obstruction (never smokers as having asthma or ever smokers as having COPD). Large epidemiological surveys of adults have demonstrated that about one-third of participants who have mild airway obstruction before inhaling a fast-acting bronchodilator (pre-BD) do not have airway obstruction post-BD. However, the majority of studies of chronic lung disease in adults do not take the time to perform post-BD spirometry (since it takes 15-20 min). A chronic cough is a very common feature in smokers who have developed COPD, so some studies wrongly include people with a chronic cough or chronic bronchitis under their de fi nition of COPD. However, even in adult smokers, there The bottom graph ( b ) shows traditional volume-time curves, from which the FEV1 and FVC are measured. The man's FEV1 was 1.5 l (from the pre-bronchodilator smaller curve); his FVC was 3.0 l; and his FEV1/FVC was only 0.50, con fi rming airway obstruction. The small x-marks indicate the predicted normal values. Ten minutes after inhaling a bronchodilator (albuterol), his FEV1 increased to 2.0 l (about 33% larger) and his FVC increased to about 3.7 l. If he had been a smoker with COPD, his bronchodilator response would have been much smaller (usually less than 0.25 l) are many other causes for a chronic cough (e.g., rhinosinusitis, gastro-esophageal re fl ux and asthma), so large COPD misclassi fi cation rates result when an objective measurement of airway obstruction is not performed.",

Using a large community-based cohort of individuals >65 years of age in the US, the CHS de fi ned de fi nite asthma as positive responses to the questions: \"Has a physician ever told you that you have asthma?\" and \"Do you still have asthma?\" Probable asthma was de fi ned as a history of wheezing in the past year associated with chest tightness or breathlessness. Excluding smokers and those with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, 4% of individuals had de fi nite asthma and 4% had probable asthma [ 16 ] . Among current smokers, 11% had de fi nite asthma and 14% had probable asthma. The age of asthma onset was spread approximately evenly among decades, with 25% reporting onset before age 20 and 27% after age 60. In the US, the National Health Interview Survey asks questions regarding lifetime history of asthma, current asthma prevalence, and asthma attacks in the last 12 months [ 17 ] . For all age groups, asthma prevalence has been steadily increasing since 1980. For example, the prevalence of current asthma in those aged 65 and above rose from 6.0% in 2001 to 7.0% in 2004. For those \u00b3 65 years of age, asthma is consistently more prevalent in women than in men. In 2003, 3.3% of women over age 65 reported an asthma attack during the previous 12 months, compared to 1.7% of older men. The National Center for Health Statistics tracks data on physician encounters for asthma. Using this data, the National Ambulatory Care Survey reported that those \u00b3 65 years of age have the second-highest rate of outpatient of fi ce visits for asthma after preschool children, but do not have signi fi cantly different rates for emergency room visits compared to other adult age groups [ 18 ] . The 65+ age group accounts for a greater proportion of hospitalizations (23%) than the size of its population (13%) would indicate, and has higher asthma mortality rates than do young adults [ 6 ] .",

On average, the functional reserve of the lungs continues to slowly erode throughout older age, even in healthy individuals who have never smoked and had no measurable environmental exposures. The FEV1 declines at a somewhat faster rate than the FVC (largely due to a loss of lung tissue elasticity), so the FEV1/FVC also declines with aging. Age-related impairments in respiratory physiology become most problematic during maximal exercise or in an episode of acute lung injury (e.g., pneumonia), as well as in individuals who already have a reduced ventilatory reserve due to lung disease.",

Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) ranges from 20 (very low) to 150 cm of water (normal), and is the best index of respiratory muscle strength [ 38 ] . MIP is an independent predictor of all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory death in older adults [ 39 ] .",

About half of older adults who have asthma and about one-third of those who have COPD are current smokers. Smoking cessation, both in middle age and older ages, is the only intervention that has been proven to slow the progression of COPD (thereby altering the natural history of the disease). Smoking cessation has been proven to make asthma respond better to inhaled corticosteroids, thus improving asthma control, and has been proven to prolong the life of those with COPD. The chronic cough and phlegm production of COPD will improve with successful smoking cessation, but the loss of lung function and emphysema are not reversible. The cough may get worse for a few weeks, but the degree of dyspnea on exertion tends to remain.",

In developed countries, about 4% of older adults have been diagnosed with asthma and another 4% with COPD. Epidemiologic studies use standardized questionnaires to determine the presence of asthma and post-BD spirometry to detect and verify COPD. An upper respiratory viral infection commonly leads to the initial diagnosis of asthma in older adults. About 90% of COPD is due to the cumulative effects of cigarette smoking in genetically-susceptible individuals. About half of older adults with asthma have allergic triggers. Periodic exacerbations with dyspnea, wheezing and cough are the major morbidity of asthma and COPD. Both conditions are associated with a higher risk of death. In older adults, the most effective prevention for both asthma and COPD is smoking cessation.",
