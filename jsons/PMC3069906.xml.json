The weight change resulting from the venous pressure increase of 6 cm of water was recorded for 5 minutes. The weight recording has two exponential components that reflect the rapid expansion of vascular volume and the slower phase of transvascular fluid filtration. The amount of fluid filtered in 5 minutes was determined via logarithmic extrapolation of the slower component to time 0. The lung capillary filtration coefficient, a measure of lung vascular liquid permeability, was computed as milliliters per minute per centimeter of water per gram dry weight by normalizing the estimate of filtered fluid by time, venous pressure change, and lung dry weight.",

Because the studies involved transplantation of human progenitor cells in mice, the question of xenotransplantation was considered. In mice treated with CsA, transplantation of human d7EB cells (500,000 cells in 200 \u03bcL of PBS) reduced mortality after lethal CLP, from 10% in control mice receiving mitomycin-blocked mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to approximately 40% in the transplant group (Figure 1A). Although the CsA-immunosuppressed septic model proved useful in establishing a therapeutic role for human cells, there remained the important bias of pharmacologic immunosuppression in the sepsis model. Based on findings that ESCs and adult bone marrow stromal cells19\u201322 might not be strongly immunogenic because they generally lack major histocompatibility complex class II antigens,23 the effectiveness of these cells in immunocompetent septic mice without the complicating effects of previous immunosuppression was evaluated. Human d7EB cells in these mice were as protective against CLP-induced death as demonstrated in CsA-treated mice; that is, survival improved from less than 10% at 48 hours after CLP in control mice to 50% in the transplant group (Figure 1B). Also investigated were alterations in lung vascular permeability and edema formation at 24 hours after CLP. d7EB cell transplantation significantly reduced neutrophilic lung inflammation and lung edema and prevented lung endothelial barrier dysfunction in treated mice compared with the control group (Figure 2, A\u2013D). The improvement in lung injury and survival was associated with decreased production of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 in septic lungs, whereas there was no change in IL-10 production (Figure 2E). Despite the absence of immunosuppression, d7EB cells were not immediately rejected, and their presence in recipient mouse lungs was verified up to 24 hours after cell transplantation. Increased numbers of cells were observed in the recipient lungs at 1 and 3 hours after transplantation, as demonstrated by human-specific laminin staining (Figure 3A). The number of cells in the lungs gradually decreased, but cells were still detectable during the first 24 hours (Figure 3B); however, no cells were visible at 48 hours after administration (data not shown). To determine whether the protection induced by d7EB cells could be ascribed to secreted factors, cultured d7EB cells were stimulated overnight with LPS, 1 \u03bcg/ml, or medium alone. Addition of LPS-conditioned medium obtained from d7EB cells did not alter mortality in mice that underwent CLP compared with controls injected with nonconditioned medium or PBS (Figure 3C), indicating that d7EB cells were essential for protection.",

Supernatant NO concentrations at 6 and 12 hours after LPS stimulation of co-cultured d7EB and CD11b+ cells were significantly lower than the supernatant NO concentration from CD11b+ cells alone (Figure 5C). This effect could not be attributed to increased apoptosis because apoptosis was not significantly different in the co-cultured CD11b+ cells compared with the CD11b+ cells cultured alone (see Supplemental Figure S1 at http://ajpamjpathol.org). Analysis of iNOS expression in co-cultured CD11b+ cells showed decreased protein expression in LPS-stimulated CD11b+ cells interacting with d7EB cells (Figure 5D). This finding was supported by measurement of iNOS expression in CD11b+ cells isolated from the lungs of septic mice 12 hours after CLP, where decreased expression of the enzyme was again observed (Figure 5E). To further test the hypothesis that NO production by d7EB cells contributes to the anti-inflammatory phenotype of the mouse CD11b+ cells, an NO donor (DETA NONOate) was added directly to LPS-stimulated CD11b+ cells, this time without d7EB cells, at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2 \u03bcmol/L, and cytokine concentrations in the supernatant were measured. Reduction in TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 production by the LPS-stimulated CD11b+ cells was observed (Figure 5F). In addition, iNOS expression in these cells after stimulation with LPS was reduced to levels comparable to those observed after co-stimulation with human d7EB cells (Figure 5G).",

To determine whether these two markers identified distinct lineages of mesodermally differentiated cells, FACS-fractionated d7EB cells were subcultured based on their expression of either ACE or KDR. After 4 days in subculture, ACE+KDR+ cells gave rise to endothelial cell colonies with a characteristic architecture and positive staining for VE-cadherin and von Willebrand factor. When these cells were cultured in a two-dimensional Matrigel system (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), they gave rise to lumen-containing tubes. The ACE+KDR\u2212 cells gave rise to colonies of hematopoietic precursors that stained positive for hematopoietic markers such as CD43 (Figure 6B). The endothelial and hematopoietic colony-forming capacity of the FACS-sorted cells was quantified by counting the number and types of colonies formed per 10,000 ACE+/KDR+, ACE+/KDR\u2212, ACE\u2212/KDR\u2212, and ACE\u2212/KDR+ cells. Endothelial colonies were formed almost exclusively by the ACE+/KDR+ fraction, with a small contribution from the ACE\u2212/KDR+ cells, whereas the ACE+/KDR\u2212 fraction showed great efficiency in production of hematopoietic colonies (Figure 6C). To determine the importance of ACE and KDR markers in the observed protective phenotype against sepsis, fractionated d7EB cells were co-cultured according to their expression of ACE and KDR with the CD11b+ cells from septic mice as described above. The co-cultured cell fractions were stimulated in vitro with LPS for 12 hours, and mouse TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 production was monitored. Both the ACE+/KDR\u2212 fraction and the ACE+/KDR+ fraction significantly reduced TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 production (Figure 6D), indicating the critical role of the progenitor cells expressing only ACE in reducing TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 production by CD11b+ cells. In addition, a strong cell surface co-expression of ACE and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was observed in d7EB cells, suggesting an association between ACE expression and the capability to respond to LPS (Figure 6E).",

ACE knockout mice exhibited improved lung injury scores after acid aspiration, endotoxin challenge, and peritoneal sepsis.44 Cohort studies in humans have shown a correlation between ACE polymorphisms and susceptibility to and death from adult respiratory distress syndrome,45 and decreased plasma concentrations of ACE have been observed in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis.46 A close homologue of ACE, ACE 2, has been identified as a key factor in protection from adult respiratory distress syndrome, and it also functions as a critical in vivo receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome.47,48",

In a polymicrobial sepsis model, the beneficial effect of bone marrow stem cells was attributed to stem cell\u2013induced production of IL-10 by host macrophages,6 sphingosine-1-phosphate production by stem cells,11 and homing of stem cells to lungs through integrin expression.7,11 hESC-derived progenitor cells represent a much earlier developmental stage than bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, and they have demonstrated ability to differentiate into niche-specific mature cells, a characteristic that distinguishes them from adult mesenchymal stromal cells. Although the importance of the interaction of hESC-derived cells with host CD11b+ cells and the association of ACE expression with the protective phenotype were observed, factors such as homing to a niche and the engraftment potential of hESC-derived cells that may also be important in the observed protection cannot be ruled out.

A: Reduced production of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 by CD11b+ cells obtained from lungs of mice that received d7EB cells. Lung CD11b+ cells were isolated 12 hours after CLP from mice transplanted with and without d7EB cells (see Materials and Methods). The cells were then treated in vitro with LPS, 1 \u03bcg/ml, for 4 hours in the presence of Golgi stop and stained for TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. Intracellular TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 levels decreased in CD11b+ cells exposed in vivo to human d7EB cells. The effect was specific to CD11b+ cells and was not observed in CD11b\u2212 cells. B: d7EB cells did not alter CD11b+ subpopulations in septic lungs. CD11b+ cells were isolated from the lungs of septic mice via magnetic beads. Cell surface expression of monocyte (F4/80), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Gr-1), and natural killer cell (NK1.1) markers was examined using flow cytometry. No significant differences were noted between mice that received d7EB cells versus those who received MEF. Results are representative of 3 experiments. FSc, forward scatter; SSc, side scatter. Numbers indicate percentages. C: d7EB cells lose their protective effect against CLP-induced death in the absence of CD11b+ cells. CD11b+ cells were depleted using gadolinium chloride, anti-Gr1, and anti-NK1.1 antibodies administered i.v. 24 hours before CLP induction. CD11b-depleted hosts succumbed quickly to sepsis without improvement after d7EB cell transplantation. N = 15 in each group. D: Co-culture of d7EB cells with CD11b+ lung cells reduces production of inflammatory cytokines. Lung CD11b+ cells from septic mice were co-cultured with d7EB cells (ratio, 5:1) either directly or separated by a 0.4-\u03bcm pore size Transwell filter. Non\u2013co-cultured CD11b+ mouse cells from septic mice were used as controls. The cells were stimulated with LPS, 1 mg/ml, for 6 hours, and supernatant was collected for cytokine measurement using an ELISA specific for mouse cytokines. Directly co-cultured cells demonstrated a decrease in TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 production, whereas production of these cytokines was not significantly different from that in controls when the cells were separated using Transwell filters.
