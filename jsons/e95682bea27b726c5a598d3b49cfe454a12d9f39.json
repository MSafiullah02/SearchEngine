            "text": "In eukaryotes, newly-synthesized proteins destined for secretion are first transferred from the cytoplasm to the lumen ofthe endoplasmic reticulum, and then progress through the Golgi apparatus to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). At the TGN, the choice of secretory pathways broadens. One route, which appears to be present in all cells, is constitutive in the sense that secretion does not depend on extracellular signals. Such secretion involves the budding of vesicles or tubular elements from the TGN and their subsequent transport to and fusion with the plasma membrane, and is essential for cell growth since, among other functions, it provides new material to expand the cell surface. 1 In addition to a constitutive route , many cells maintain a secretory mode that is adapted for the tight coupling of protein release to extracellular stimuli. For such regulated exocytosis, the vesicles that carry newly-synthesized protein from the TGN accumulate in the cytoplasm until specific extracellular events trigger their fusion with the plasma membrane, resulting in the release of vesicle contents.f The vesicles involved are called dense-core granules (DCGs), the name reflecting the fact that the contents are so highly condensed that they form a large electron-dense plug in the vesicle lumen. A large amount ofprotein, as well as other molecular cargo, is thus efficiently stored in vesicular reservoirs and later released on demand. This pathway therefore permits larger and more rapid secretory responses than can be generated via constitutive secretion. Classical DCGs in endocrine, exocrine and neuroendocrine cells are responsible for storage of a wide array of signaling molecules (e.g., peptide hormones) and secreted enzymes, and related vesiclesare found in metazoan cells of other lineages as well as in numerous unicellular organisms. The secreted proteins and macromolecules playa vast range of functions, from tissue coordination in metazoans to cyst formation in protists .",

            "text": "Regulated secretion also depends upon mechanisms for controlling the timely release of DCG contents, and this is accomplished by regulating the fusion of the vesicle membrane with the plasma membrane. Much of the progress in understanding the mechanisms that mediate this step has been preceded or aided by studies of synaptic vesicles (reviewed in ref 3) , which undergo regulated fusion with the plasma membrane, but differ from DCGs in their biogenesis and acquisition of contents. Comparable work in DCG secretion has shown that many of the molecular components involved in regulating exoeytosis and achieving membrane fusion are shared by these two vesicle types. 2 In addition to proteins that appear to be specific for regulated fusion with the plasma membrane, the mechanisms include factors, such as SNARE s and Rab proteins, which are members of families of proteins that are of central importance to vesicular trafficking at multiple stages in the eukaryotic secretory pathway. Thus, regulated exocytosis appears to be accomplished by the coupling of a regulatory mechanism to a universal core of membrane trafficking machinery. Although many of the protein components have been identified, and a more complete understanding of the process remains an important goal for ongoing research. The mechanistic studies of regulated membrane fusion are too extensive to be included in this chapter, but have been covered in many reviews,4-8 and above.

Crescents representproteinsthat arefound in a relatively evendistribution throughout the lumen. The extent to whichsomeconstitutively secretedproteinsmaybe concentrated within specific regionsof individualcisternaeis not incorporated into this model. This chapter will instead focus on a part of the pathway that precedes regulated exocytosis, namely the synthesis steps that lead to the formation of DCGs, beginning at the TGN. The TGN is a complex compartment that gives rise not only to the regulated and constitutively released classes of secretory vesicles but also to vesicles that carry hydrolytic enzymes to lysesomes. 9 -11 Therefore, we seek an understanding ofthe signals that guide outbound proteins in a 3-way TGN sorting problem (Fig. 1) . DCG protein sorting also continues in a post-TGN compartment, where additional factors come into play. This pathway has been the subject of numerous valuable reviews,12-19 with a particularly thorough treatment by Arvan and Cascle. 20 The Anatomy ofDCG Formation A number of important insights into the pathway of DCG formation have come from electron microscopy, providing a context for molecular and genetic studies. First , the fact that DCGs appear dense implies the existence of mechanisms to drive a degree of macromolecular aggregation that is unusual within the secretory pathway. Many lines of research have led to the conclusion that protein sorting and concentration are intimately linked in this pathway, both relating to the self-aggregating tendency of DCG proteins that will be discussed below.",

In contrast, cisterna in trans regions are marked by multiple perforations and are dilated in regions that accumulate aggregates of secretory material. Those dilations grow progressively larger in the more distal regions, while the nondilated portions take on a tubular appearance. At the trans-most cisterna, the dilated regions with their concentrated secretory cargo appear to exist as independent bodies, separate from a residual network oftubular membranes. Several points were established or reinforced by these images. The first is that the visible concentration of DCG proteins begins within Golgi cisternae . A second point is that the TGN, the vesicle donor, appears to be undergoing large-scale changes itself. The images also indicate that the vesicles do not bud conventionally in the manner that is well-established for coat (e.g., clarhrinl-mediared steps, since no coats are seen.",

An early phase occurs at the trans face ofthe Golgi and results in the production of vesicles bearing concentrated secretory proteins. These are called immature secretory granules (ISGs).29Subsequently those vesiclesare remodeled, as reflected morphologically by cargo condensation and biochemically by changes in protein composition, to become mature DCGs. 30. 31 For simplicity, we will refer to the first process as budding, and the second as maturation. Central issues to be considered in this chapter are the mechanisms responsible for protein sorting during those successivesteps. Again for simplicity, we will largely confine our discussion to the DCGs found in neuronal and endocrine cells. Many of the same mechanisms are likely to apply to other classes of DCGs, among which are those in hematopoetic cells; for example, see references 32 and 33.",

            "text": "Genetics frequently offers a natural complement to morphological studies for developing an overview ofa pathway. Unfortunately, a weakness in current approaches to analyzing DCG biogenesis is the absence of developed genetic models, although several systems show promise. No human diseases are known to stem from an inability to synthesize neuroendocrine DCGs. Presumably, strong defects in DCG formation would result in embryonic lethality in a complex multicellular organism, since such a defecr would preclude regulated secretion of many peptides involved in tissue coordination. However, this has not prevented the generation of regulated exocytosis mutants in more simple systems, such as Drosophila. In flies, the null phenotype of a gene called dCAPS (Calcium-Activated Protein for Secretion), is embyronic lethal, but analysis of the larva has shown that the gene product is necessary for DCG exocytosis,34 as predicted from earlier work in mammalian chromaffin cells. 35. 36 Although mutations affecting earlier stages in the pathway (i.e., DCG synthesis) have not been characterized in this organism, the characterization of CAPS mutants in this system provides hope that the earlier steps will be accessible by further mutational analysis. C elegans offers another potentially useful system for the genetic analysis of DCG synthesis, and several mutations affecting regulated exocytosis have been identified in this organism (reviewed in ref. 37) .",

[38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] The viability ofthese mutants substantiates the idea that regulated exocytosis, unlike constitutive secretion, is not involved in basal cell growth . That is, DCGs are essential for organismal survival in metazoans, but not for individual cell viability. In the PCl2 lines, some mutations appear to disrupt the transcription ofnumerous granule protein genes. 45, 46 In the ciliate mutants, which appear to be due to single recessivealleles, the cargo genes are still expressed though no granules are synthesized. In one Tetrahymena line, normal granule cargo appears to be shunted to the constitutive secretory pathway.47This phenotype indicates that DCG cargo proteins are not sufficient to direct granule formation, a result which was particularly interesting in the context of experiments in which mammalian DCG cargo proteins were expressed in tissue culture cells that do not normally make DCGs. 48 -51 Such cells make vesicles with dense cores, presumably because cargo proteins expressed in nonspecialized cells can induce the formation oftheir own carriers from the TGN. These results implied that the capacity to make DCGs was inherent in the basic organization of the Golgi/TGN since it could also occur in such nonspecialized cells. Since this capacity appears to have been lost in the Tetrahymena mutant, the defect in that line may point to an aspect of Goigi/TGN function that is critical for regulated but not constitutive secretion.",

            "text": "A long-standing issue is whether the primary mode of DCG protein sorting is active or passive. The model of active sorting was initially inspired by the paradigmof sorting to lysosornes, in which sorting derives from recognition of a set of soluble lumenal proteins by a transmembranereceptor. Extendingthis to DCG biogenesis, the modelpositedthat a subsetof proteinshavepositive sorting signals for inclusionin ISGs. 52 \u2022 53 In this scheme, proteinsin the TGN lumen that lack targetingsignals are presumedto follow an alternative, default pathway of constitutive secretion. This model has been called \"sorting for entry\" (Fig. lA) . An alternative model posits that newly synthesized proteins can be targeted to ISGs by default , even in the absence of specific targeting signals, if the flux of bulk membrane traffic toward ISGs is greater than that to constitutive or lysosomal carriers. This may indeed be the case for cells that are highly committed to regulated exoeytosis. 54 ,55 In this case, the major sorting events occur in the ISG, which becomes a functional extension of the TGN. Proteins that are retained as ISGs undergo maturation end up as the contents of mature granules. Nongranule proteins can be selectivelywithdrawn from ISGs during this period, and this model is termed \"sorting by retention\" (Fig. 2B) .",

Among other things, it allows a large group of proteins to be sorted together in a single step. One implication is that sorting receptors, if present, could presumably function at concentrations that are dramatically sub-stoichiometric to their DCG protein ligands. Furthermore, such receptors would only have to recognize some subset ofDCG proteins , since the remainder could be sorted indirectly via aggregation. In fact, no receptor has ever been unambiguously identified in this pathway.

This first sorting step can therefore be imagined as the evolutionary version of ammonium sulfate precipitation, with the collective behavior based on the proteins' individual biophysical properties, for example their surface charge. While the ability of individual proteins to aggregate is variable,59 mixtures of proteins may show cooperativiry in vitro, thereby increasing the efficiency of the step (Fig. 3A) . 60 Efficient protein aggregation might be expected to show concentration-dependence, and indeed isolated DCG proteins only self-associate above a threshold concentration.57 This in turn suggests that minor constituents of DCGs may depend for their efficient sorting on coassociation with more abundant species, whose concentrations must be sufficiently high to drive their independent self-aggregation. The sorting efficiency of individual proteins can be experimentally measured as the fraction that is stored in DCGs as opposed to being mistargeted to the constitutive pathway. Asexpected from coassociation models, the sorting efficiency of a protein may vary widely between different cell lines. One would also predict that the sorting efficiency ofa protein could be boosted by increasing the expression levelof other proteins with which it coaggregates, particularly those which are most abundant. Chiefamong the abundant metazoan DCG proteins are the chromogranin/secretogranins, a group of proteins with shared physical characteristics despite their very limited sequence similariry.61,62 Indeed, the overexpression ofChromogranin B (CgB) in the AtT-20 neuroendocrine cell line increased the sorting efficiency of a second DCG protein, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). 63 Nonetheless , it is inherently difficult to test the proposition that self-or coaggregation is a primary sorting determinant using conventional structurefunction analysis, since aggregation is thought to be directed by gross biophysical properties of DCG proteins , and there are no clear \"aggregation signals\" at the amino acid sequence level. However, recent studies have shown that sorting efficiency can be increased by providing an artificial aggregation signal. Heterologous expression of a 6HIS-tagged secretory protein enhanced the aggregation and DCG storage, in a calcium-dependent fashion, of CgA.64,65The authors speculate that the tag functions as an \"aggregation chaperone\" by providing a local site for the binding of divalent cations, thereby nucleating the aggregation process. Curiously stably incorporated into the aggregates, suggesting that DCG proteins in their aggregated form interact more strongly with other DCG proteins than with the HIS tagged peptide. Whether endogenous proteins have similar nucleation-promoting properties remains to be determined.",

When expressed in the neuroendocrine cells, the exocrine proteins were not stored in DCGs but instead secreted constitutively. 67 In similar experiments, an endothelial DCG protein, von Willebrand factor, was expressed in neuroendocrine AtT20 cells. 49 This resulted, however, not in the constitutive secretion ofvon Willebrand factor but instead in the formation of two morphologically-distinct classes of granules. One contained endogenous chromogranins, while the other contained von Willebrand factor. A possibility is that two sets ofproteins aggregate independently in the TGN, which could be determined by a number of factors. For example, the two sets could precipitate at relatively distinct pH and/or calcium concentrations and thus be spatially or temporally separated. Specific aggregate formation can also arise from conventional protein-protein interactions. In pituitary and pancreatic islet cells, for example, efficient sorting ofCgA to DCGs depends on its association with secretogranin III, and an essential targeting sequence in CgA has been determined by gene truncation. 68 CgA sorting in PC12 cells also depends on a specific sequence in the protein, which overlaps with, but is not identical to, that region which is required in pituitary cells. 69 This difference suggests that CgA may be interacting with a different partner in PC12 cells, and indeed these cells do not express secretogranin III. One possibility is that different surfaces of a CgA domain can interact specifically with a range of partners, like a good host at a cocktail party.",

In comparison to the production of insulin crystals, which involves the assembly of a single protein, the formation of DCG ultrastructure in protozoa may be significantly more complex. In these cells, the lumen ofmature DCGs is filled by a crystalline core that consists of multiple varieties ofproteins,?4,75 Indeed , the localization of different proteins within the cores of Paramecium DCGs has revealed that the crystals contain at least two distinct layers, each with a different set of protein componenrs. f\" Images ofISGs reveal that the components of the two layers are interspersed in this compartment, indicating that the layersare formed during a subsequent reorganization phase. Thus, there is a significant amount of reorganization that must occur during crystal assembly. Overall, the term \"aggregation\" may be misleading insofar as it suggests a phenomenon based on \"stickiness\", as for example for misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. 77 Instead, the interactions that occur between individual proteins in an aggregate may be transient and weak, stimulating formation of aggregates in the TGN due to stabilizing effects provided by multivalent interactions while also allowing for reorganization of the proteins during crystallization, as in Figure 3 .",

Whether this fraction is in dynamic equilibrium with the remaining~90% is not known, but there is no known chemical difference between the two cohorts. The membrane binding ofCgB is associated with an N-terminal domain defined by a disulfide-anchored loop, which is sufficient to confer membrane association when linked to an otherwise soluble protein. 82 Importantly, the chimeric protein was sorted to DCGs in spite of the fact that it did not appear to aggregate, suggesting that the N-terminal domain constitutes an independent targeting signal. That same domain may promote homodimerization at neutral~H, implying that it may mediate different interactions in sequential secretory compartments. 3 CgB, as discussedearlier,also showsa strong tendency to aggregatein a controlled fashion. The coexistence in a single protein of domains that facilitate both protein-membrane binding and homo-or heterotypic protein-protein aggregation, offers the potential to generate cooperative networks with physiologically-useful properties (Fig. 3B) . First, the total concentration of DCG proteins needed to reach the aggregation threshold in the TGN may be reduced for any proteins that interact with the membrane, since the local concentration may be increased depending on local membrane geometry. Secondly, the avidity of a CgB aggregate for the membrane will be greater than that ofa monomer, since multiple N-terminal domains are availablefor independent membrane binding. Validation of this came from an extension of the experiments with CgB chimeras outlined above. While a single N-terminal CgB domain was able to direct sorting to DCGs, efficient sorting only occurred when two such domains were present.82 This suggests that the membrane affinity of a single domain may be only marginally sufficient, but is more than adequate if two or more such domains are linked, as would be the case in a CgB aggregate.",

In principle, membrane proteins could be targeted by signals in their lumenal, transmembrane and/or cytoplasmic domains; however the characterization ofsuch signals has not been straightforward. A significant obstacle has been the fact that relatively few membrane proteins have been identified that are exclusivelylocalized to granules. 20 Phogrin (phosphatase homolog in granules of insulinoma) localizes to DCGs in a range of neuronal and endocrine tissues. 98 It is a transmembrane protein with an N-terminallumenal domain and C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, and is synthesized with a large N-terminal proregion that is later cleaved within ISGs. Either the pro-domain or the lumenal domain of the processed protein can be independently stored in DCGs, indicating that each contain signals sufficient for rargeting. 99 One possibility is that these, and by implication the full length phogrin as well, can be sorted by associating with the condensing core of granule cargo in the TGN. This may also be true for two DCG membrane proteins of the anterior pituitary and adrenal medulla, peptidylglycine a-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) and dopamin\u1ebd -hydroxylase.60In these cases, there is physiological evidence that the lumenal domains can sort independently of the transmembrane or cytosolic domains, since both the soluble forms and the transmembrane forms occur naturally in DCGs. lOO Nonetheless, efficient storage of the transmembrane form of PAM also requires signals within the cytoplasmic taiL101",

The tyrosine-based motif suggests that this protein can interact with a coat-associated adaptor, and indeed a functional role for AP-3 in the sorting ofP-selectin to DCGs has been suggested,llO but no ident ified coats are involved in the formation ofISGs in the TGN. One possibility is that conventional adaptor/coat-mediated sorting of P-selectin occurs at a step distinct from the known budding and maturation steps in DCG bio~enesis; a second is that adaptors may have noncanonical roles unrelated to coat recruitment.I I The studies ofP-selectin have revealed clear evidence that a cytosolic signal can be important for the sorting of transmembrane proteins to DCGs. Further analysis of the targeting mechanism will likely be an important topic in future research, as it represents an activity that is topologically distinct from the relatively well characterized aggregation-based sorting events in the lumen. In an intriguing set of experiments, Cutler and colleagues found evidence that the function ofthis cytosolic sorting determinant can be coupled to the expression ofa lumenal DCG protein. When the lumenal DCG protein von Willebrand factor (vWF) was coexpressed with P-selectin in neuroendocrine AtT-20 cells, the vWF was stored in vesicles that were distinct from DCGs containing endogenously-expressed CgB, 1l2,1l3 a finding that is consistent with previous results.I14The novel and intriguing finding was that P-selectin was preferentially targeted to the vWF-containing vesicles, indicating that vWF and Pvselectin, which are normally expressed in platelet and endothelial cells, could be cosorred in a cell type in which they are heterologously expressed (Fig. 5) . There was no indication, however, of a direct interaction between the two proteins, and the sorting ofP-selectin in this context was instead dependent on the same tyrosine-containing cytoplasmic motif that had previously been shown to be necessary for targeting to DCGs.",

Cholesterol depletion has been shown to inhibit both pathways,93 however it is difficult to know whether the treatment has a direct effect on both pathways, or whether the inhibition of one pathway could inhibit the second via some indirect mechanism.

            "text": "Depending on cell type, the importance of ISGs as a locus of protein sorting may be as important as that of the TGN. Sorting at this level involves the budding of vesicles from ISG membranes, resulting in the remodeling of membrane and lumenal contents by selective withdrawal (Fig. 6B ). This targeted removal occurs via clathrin-coat recruitment to ISGs occurs via the AP-1 adaptor, wh ich is recruited by membrane proteins in an ARF-dependent, BFA-inhibitable step.139 Proteins known to be withdrawn from ISGs include the cargo protease furin and the mannose-6-phosphate receptor, both of which can interact directly with AP_l.140.143 The mannose-S-phosphate receptor can bind any lysosomal enzymes that may have been incorrectly sorted upon exit from the TGN, and this step therefore leads to selective withdrawal of some lumenal proteins by classical receptor-based sorting. 144 Mature DCGs do not support CCV formation, the simplest explanation for which is that ISGs become progressivelydepleted ofproteins that act in the recruitment ofAP-1. Consistent with this, myristoylated ARF 1 binds to ISGs but not mature granules in vitro. 139 Recent evidence suggests that the full cohort of ARFs and adaptors present on ISGs includes ARF1, 5 and 6, and AP-1 and _3. 145 These may all be present on a uniform population of vesicles, or may reflect heterogeneity within ISGs. 143 Coated vesicles budding from the ISG will also withdraw any soluble proteins that randomly partition by diffusion into the vesicle lumen during budding. However, large aggregates of proteins that are condensing in the ISG are too large to fit into the buds , and are therefore selectively retained. 146 The efficiency of this separation is increased by the tendency of Trafficking Imide Cells: Pathways, Mechanisms and Regulation nonaggregating proteins to be concentrated at the periphery of the vesicle lumen , as they are excluded from the dense core forming in the center ofthe ISG. As a result, the soluble proteins accumulate in a place where they can readily enter the vesicles that are budding from the membrane. These may include proteins that randomly partition at the TGN into budding ISGs, but will also include some soluble products of DCG proprotein processing. The best characterized of these is derived from proinsulin, which is processed into and A, B, and C peptides. 147 The first two are disulfide linked, and crystallize to form the granule core. The C peptide is soluble and is largely excluded from the core, and is selectivelywithdrawn. 148.149 A collateral consequence of ISG maturation is the generation of a set of coated vesicles bearing newly synthesized proteins, some ofwhich have undergone processing by ISG-specific enzymes. At least in some cell types, these can deliver their cargo to the plasma membrane, probably via an endosomal intermediate. 150 This has been called \"constitutive-like\" secretion: constitutive-like in that it is independent ofextracellular stimulation, but with kinetics that are slower than those of true constitutive secretion. In pancreatic~cells, the C peptide that is withdrawn from ISGs is secreted via this route .",

In the TGN, these molecules play important modulating roles, including the recruitment of AP-l/clathrin coat proteins for vesicle budding. 151 The levels on PI-4-P in the TGN are affected by the activity of PI-4 kinase, which is stimulated by myristoylated ARF1-GTI~a part of the coat formation machinery.152,153 Interestin~r: ISGs have been found to contain a PI-4-K activity that is not stimulated by ARFI-GTp' 1 The TGN has two different PI-4 kinases (II and III) , and it is possible that ISGs only recruit one of these. 152.153 Coat recruitment at the TGN vs. ISGs may also be differentially regulated by modification of the vesicle cargo, since the binding of AP-l to the cytoplasmic tails of both furln and the mannose-6~hosphate receptor is stimulated following their phosphorylation by Casein Kinase II.141 ,1 In this regard, a very interesting observation is that newly-budded ISGs are rapidly transported to the cell periphery, at least in some cell types, and therefore primarily inhabit a different cellular microenvironment from the TGN. 155 This may be relevant for differential regulation of similar activities at the TGN vs. ISGs, for example if receptors in ISGs are selectively modified.",

This calcium may be cotransported from the endoplasmic reticulum with calcium-binding DCG cargo proteins, or imported via ISG membrane ion exchangers. 162 The ionic changes can trigger changes in DCG protein conformations or interactions .

One well-established consequence ofISG acidification, in combination with increased Ca 2 +, is the activation of proteases that are specifically localized to DCGs. The contents of neuronal and endocrine DCGs are largely synthesized as proteins that are proteolytically processed to generate bioactive peptides, the species that are eventually released during exocytosis. l64 Proteolytic processing involves a variety of enzymes including amino-and carboxypeptidases, and a family ofaspartyl proteases called prohormone convertases.

First, the condensation ofmaterial allows great quantities of protein to be stored in the vesicles,with the consequence that a small number ofexocytic events can generate a relativelylarge secretory response. Second, proteolytic processing in ISGs allows the cell to combine multiple DCG peptides into a single proprotein, thereby linking the sorting of these proteins at earlier stages of the pathway. In neuroendocrine ISGs, for example, the chromogranin proteins are cleaved into multiple biologically active peptides with different postexocytic functions. 62 ,175 Furthermore, limiting the site of proteolytic processing to ISGs may provide a failsafe mechanism, ensuring that the active forms of the proteins are only found in a compartment that is under direct control of the regulated secretory pathway, therefore leaving any incorrectly sorted proteins as uncleaved precursors.",

In AtT20 cells, unregulated release ofDCGs from ISGs proceeds for 2-3 hours after ISG budding from the TGN. 176 These ISGs contain two SNAREs, VAMP4 and Synaptota~min IV (Syt IV) , which are withdrawn during maturation in a brefeldin A-inhibitable step.I 9,171,177 During the same period , the maturing granules become responsive to exocytic stimuli, a process also blocked by BFA. That the two phenomena may be linked is suggested by the observation that overexpression ofSyt IV itself decreased the responsiveness of maturing granules to secretory stimuli. 17l Syt IV is thought to act as a negative regulator of calcium-induced exocytosis,178 and the withdrawal of this inhibitory factor from ISGs may foster maturation. A recent study showed that the removal ofVAMP4 from ISGs depends upon interactions with AP-l and the coat protein PACS-l,179 thereby providing genetic confirmation and molecular detail to this model. However, a complication ofthis model is that Syt IV is thought to inhibit membrane fusion by forming inactive heterodimers with synaptotagmin I, and the mechanism by which the heterodimers are separated and Syt N is selectively removed from the ISGs is unknown.",

In some systems homotypic-like fusion might allow for the synthesis ofspecialized DCG cores in which the contents are not randomly distributed. In Pseudomicrotborax dubius, two kinds of ISGs, containing morpholo \u00a7ically-distinguishable cargo, fuse during the process ofassembling a complex core structure. 18 More generally, consolidation could potentially define the size of the granules, which in many systems appear to be controlled. 183 Disruption of the gene encoding Rab3D, an exocrine granule-associated small GTPase, resulted in a doubling ofmature granule volume, and one possibility is that Rab3D acts as a negative regulator of homotypic fusion. 184 At some level, membrane remodeling must account for the difference in the fusogenic behavior of ISGs vs. mature granules, and attention has focused on the SNAREs, due to their importance in regulating membrane fusion. ISGs from PCl2 cells contain syntaxin 6, which must be present on both donor and acceptor membranes for efficient homotypic fusion in vitro.In Syntaxin6 is also present in clathrin-coated vesicles which bud from the ISG rnernbrane ,142 consistent with the idea that it is selectively removed during maturation via several likely AP-I binding sites in its cytoplasmic domain. 140 As ISG maturation appears to involve the removal of specific factors via the budding of clathrin coated vesicles, it is possible that more thorough analyses of the target proteins and their interacting partners will help to uncover ISG-specific machinery that regulates clathrin-dependenr sorting in this compartment. More broadly, the identification of the molecules that define the functional maturity ofDCGs by their presence or absence in the vesicle will provide insights into the nature of organelle identity, a topic that is central to an understanding the general principles of vesicular traffic. Finally, recent evidence hints at aspects of granule maturation that have not previously been recognized. Functional maturation of secretory granules may extend beyond the period of morphological change, based on the observation that the distribution and fusogenic activity of granules may change with vesicle age.185",

These studies have, for the most part, supported the nonspecific aggregation-based model for sorting that was proposed by Chanat and Huttner in 1991.57 Not surprisingly, studies of many granule cargo proteins in multiple systems have revealedsome casesthat are possible exceptions to this general rule, where specificprotein-protein interactions are required for the sorting of a particular protein, as discussed in the \"Protein Sorting into ISGs\" section of this chapter. Overall, the precise requirements for the sorting of any particular protein is likely to be both context (which other granule cargo proteins are being expressed, and in what quantities) and cell type dependent (protein aggregation is sensitive to physiological properties of the lumen, such as calcium concentration and pH, which may vary between cell types), though it is likely that the general principles of aggregation-based sorting apply in all cells that produce DCGs. Further analysis of the specific sorting requirements for individual proteins may lead to a greater knowledge of the details ofaggregation-based sorting, but the next leap forward in our understanding of they system will more likely come from experimental approaches that expand beyond the level of individual proteins and consider the DCG synthesis pathway more broadly. For example, cargo protein aggregation is known to be sensitive to lumenal calcium concentration and pH levels, but the mechanisms that control these physiologic parameters have not been elucidated. Secondly, how are granule cargo proteins sorted to the same destination as other proteins that are essential for DCG function, such as membrane fusion machinery? The answers to these questions may be learned from studies in genetic systems, such as C. elegans, Drosophila, and ciliated protozoans, which offer promising avenues for further experimentation. These orf.anisms have recently been used to identify elements of the regulated exocytosis machinery.' ,186,187 and similar studies could uncover genes that are involved in vesicle synthesis.",

            "text": "Another major gap in our understanding of the granule synthesis pathway is the extent of its functional relationship with other branches of the secretory pathway. Two decades ago, DGC formation was considered to be one of a small number of distinct, post-TGN secretory pathways. This carried the assumption that vesicles bound for constitutive or regulated exocytosis, or toward lysosomes, would rely on distinct mechanisms for their biogenesis. That view now seems, paradoxically, to have been both too simple and too complex. It was too simple because post TGN traffic cannot be neatly divided into three branches: for example, what was called the constitutive pathway may in fact consist of multiple branches.188.189 This was initially established for apical vs. basolateral targeting in polarized epithelia, but there is evidence in other cell types as well. Furthermore, the mechanisms for DCG formation are not easily separated from those that are directly involved in other pathways, implying that the secretory pathway cannot be divided into distinct, independently functioning branches. For example, AP-1 dependent sorting of proteins to the lysosomal pathway is associated with ISG maturation, and may also be part of the driving force for the \"sorting by exclusion\" of DCG contents in the TGN (see \"Protein Sorting in ISGs\" section).",

Similarly, the historical view that constitutive and regulated secretory carriers are fundamentally different may also be incorrect. The idea that constitutive traffic is based on small vesiclesis being modified by the recognition that TGN tubularion may be as, if not more, important in this pathway, at least in some cell types (referencesin ref 190) . Thus coat-mediated vesicle formation may be the exception rather than the rule for anterograde traffic to the plasma membrane, and the formation of constitutive and regulated secretory carriers may share common mechanisms . In the extreme, the mechanisms may be mostly conserved, and the end products depend upon the behavior of the vesicle cargo.",
