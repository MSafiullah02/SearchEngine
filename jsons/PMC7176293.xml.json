This enzyme class serves the human body in diverse ways. Some serine proteases, such as, the digestive enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin, cleave a broad spectrum of peptides and proteins. Others such as the coagulation enzymes thrombin and factor Xa are highly selective and only cleave very particular substrates. Frequently, proteases are expressed in a non-active precursor form, the so-called zymogens. To transform these into their active form, in many cases sequence segments of the zymogen polypeptide chain are cleaved that otherwise serve as endogenous inhibitors of the activated enzyme. The release of the active form can either occur by autocatalysis (e.g., trypsin) or by other activating proteases (e.g., the coagulation cascade). An active site serine side chain plays a decisive role in the catalytic mechanism of serine proteases, esterases, and lipases. It is characterized by an extraordinarily high chemical reactivity. In chymotrypsin, only this serine reacts with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), whereas 27 other serine residues in the enzyme remain unmodified. Upon chemical transformation with DFP, the enzyme completely loses its catalytic activity.",

The numbering of the amino acids in serine proteases of the chymotrypsin type is based on the sequence of chymotrypsin. The spatial structures of a large variety of serine proteases are now available, of which a few are listed in Table 23.1. The structures show an extraordinarily pronounced similarity in the active site even for proteases that have entirely different folding patterns (10.1007/978-3-642-17907-5_14, compare trypsin with subtilisin). This so-called catalytic triad of Ser\u2013His\u2013Asp is characteristic of serine proteases. In some of these enzymes, the aspartate can be replaced by a glutamate whereas some transpeptidases and \u03b2-lactamases display a lysine in place of the histidine in the active site.\n",

            "text": "As these three amino acids are very far apart from one another in the sequence, the protein must fold appropriately to bring the three side chains into spatial proximity to one another. The catalytic serine, found at position 195 in the trypsin-like proteases, carries out the actual attack on the amide bond that is being cleaved (Fig.23.1). The oxygen atom of an unactivated hydroxyl group would not be reactive enough for this step. Its nucleophilicity which describes its tendency to attack an electron-poor carbonyl carbon atom, is enhanced by the neighboring histidine side chain. The imidazole side chain of this histidine can accept a proton from the serine hydroxyl group, enabling a nucleophilic attack of the now negatively charged oxygen atom on the partially positively charged carbon atom of the amide carbonyl group. The neighboring aspartate can accept a proton from the histidine imidazole ring, and release it again. In this way, it compensates the positive charge that is formed on the histidine residue. To stabilize the transition state formed upon attack on the carbonyl group, serine proteases have another characteristic structural motif, the so-called oxyanion hole. This is a small pocket next to the side chain of Ser195 composed of two main-chain NH groups (Fig.23.1). In a few cases, the terminal amide groups of asparagine or glutamine can accomplish this task. The function of the oxyanion hole is to stabilize the negative charge formed on the tetrahedral transition state and to distort the geometry of the attacked carbonyl carbon atom from a trigonal-planar to a tetrahedral configuration. The formed transition state collapses with release of the C-terminal cleavage product which carries a free amino group at its end. The N-terminal cleavage product remains covalently bound to the protease to give an acyl\u2013enzyme intermediate. In a subsequent step, a nucleophilic attack by a water molecule again leads to a tetrahedral transition state. This finally collapses with release of the N-terminal cleavage product. The catalytic enzyme is then ready for the next transformation.\n",

In 1988, Paul Carter and James Wells prepared various mutants of the bacterial serine protease subtilisin (10.1007/978-3-642-17907-5_14) at Genentech. Exchange of the catalytic serine or histidine for alanine leads to a reduction in the catalytic activity by more than six orders of magnitude. Surprisingly, exchange of the aspartic acid, the only function of which is to exchange a proton with histidine, reduced the catalytic activity by more than four orders of magnitude. The combined exchange of multiple amino acids of the catalytic triad led to no further reduction in the catalytic activity. The threefold-alanine mutant, in which the catalytic triad is completely removed, still cleaves the peptide substrate more than 1,000 times faster than the pure buffer solution! The substrate remaining binding sites and the oxyanion hole, the structure and properties of which stabilize the tetrahedral transition state, are responsible for this acceleration.",

The subtilisin mutants in which the histidine was exchanged for an alanine, cleave substrates with the sequence -Phe\u2013Ala\u2013X\u2013Phe- (X = Ala or Gln, for example) six orders of magnitude more slowly than the unaltered subtilisin with one exception: A substrate with the sequence -Phe\u2013Ala\u2013His\u2013Phe- is cleaved only four orders of magnitude more slowly. The histidine of the substrate takes over the role of the histidine in the catalytic site to a certain extent! This process is called substrate-supported catalysis. The transformation is indeed still rather slow, but the specificity of this mutant is distinctly enhanced: The -Phe\u2013Ala\u2013His\u2013Phe- sequence is cleaved 200 times faster than any of the other -Phe\u2013Ala\u2013X\u2013Phe- sequences.",

            "text": "Proteases recognize polypeptide chains as substrates. For this task they use a series of more-or-less-pronounced binding pockets on their surface, as described in 10.1007/978-3-642-17907-5_14. These are structurally and electronically complementary to the side chains of the substrate. As a consequence, the polypeptide chain of the substrate will be immobilized on the surface in the vicinity of the catalytic site. The crevices on the surface look very different depending on the protease. Surface portions of four different serine proteases from the trypsin family are shown in Fig.23.2. A comparison of the different serine proteases with different substrate specificities (Fig.23.3) shows that, above all, the structures of the S1 pockets of these enzymes are different. The S1 pocket is largely formed of the sequence segments from 189\u2013195 and 214\u2013220. Significant differences are unique to the side chains of the amino acid at the positions 189, 216, and 226. In chymotrypsin, these are Ser189, Gly216, and Gly226. They tailor the depth and form of this pocket to accommodate the aromatic side chains of the amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. Correspondingly, chymotrypsin preferentially cleaves peptide chains after one of these three amino acids. Trypsin also has a deep, spacious S1 pocket that is flanked by Gly216 and Gly226. The negatively charged carboxylate group of Asp189 on the floor of the pocket is decisive for the recognition of long, positively charged side chains in the amino acids lysine and arginine in the substrate. In elastase, the S1 pocket is shaped by the amino acids Val216 and Thr226. Because of this, the pocket is significantly smaller. It can only accommodate amino acids with short hydrophobic side chains such as alanine and valine. Amino acids with large groups are no longer accommodated. The amino acid 189, a serine, is buried. The substrate specificity of the described serine proteases is primarily achieved by the recognition of the amino acid in the P\n1\nposition. The neighboring pockets, however, are also important for substrate binding and selectivity. It is remarkable that the substrate-binding pockets of serine proteases recognizing the N-terminal part of the substrate (unprimed side, S1\u2013S4 pockets; 10.1007/978-3-642-17907-5_14) are more prominently established. The pockets on the unprimed side that anchors the C-terminal part of the substrate are much less well developed. Because the N-terminal cleavage product remains temporarily covalently bound to the protease as an acyl\u2013enzyme complex, this part of the substrate is bound particularly selectively.\n\n",

Accordingly, in 1967 Marcos Mares-Guia and Elliott Shaw described small-molecule trypsin inhibitors with micromolar binding affinity that only occupy the S1 pocket.

An example of this is the elastase inhibitor N-(methylsuccinoyl)-Ala\u2013Ala\u2013Pro\u2013Val-CF3 (23.21 in Fig.23.14), which is derived from the substrate sequence Pro\u2013Val. In favorable cases, the P1 equivalent alone is sufficient, for example, in the trypsin and thrombin inhibitors 23.5 and 23.6, respectively (Fig.23.4). However, the usually high chemical reactivity of the functional groups in covalently binding serine protease inhibitors, which is necessary to interact with the catalytically active serine, can be problematic. Because of their reactivity, such groups can also undergo undesirable reactions with serine residues from other enzymes and therefore cause side effects. The design of highly potent and selective inhibitors requires at least the occupancy of the S2, S3, and S4 pockets. An additional structural characteristic that all serine proteases share in common should also be mentioned: Their substrates are bound to the peptide backbone via two antiparallel-oriented hydrogen bonds. This orientation of the two hydrogen-bonding partners leads to a pleated-sheet-like geometry. In most inhibitors, an attempt is made to imitate this hydrogen-bonding pattern (Fig.23.6).\n",

An injury to the arterial vascular system leads to the situation that membrane-bound tissue factor that is found outside the vessel comes into contact with the precursor of the serine protease, factor VII, in blood. The precursor is activated to factor VIIa, and induces the coagulation cascade. Different factors are released along the cascade, which are activated by proteases from the previous step from their zymogen form. Finally, the cascade leads to the release of \u201cvon Willebrand factor,\u201d which binds to thrombocytes, and in doing so initiates the formation of a blood clot. In addition to extrinsic activation, there is also an intrinsic coagulation pathway. It is initiated by reduced blood flow or pathologically altered vasculature. In this case, the coagulation cascade is started to form a platelet aggregate, which is then stabilized by a fibrin network. Factor X is found in one of the last steps in which the two pathways merge. All of the different steps involve proteases that represent conceivable target structures for a drug therapy. Until now, in particular developments for the enzymes thrombin, factor Xa, and factor VIIa have been tackled. This has already led to development candidates and marketed products for the first two.",

The peptide forms a \u03b2-turn that enables the amino acids in this sequence to be positioned in the S3 pocket. The same pocket is accessed by the tripeptide through the side chain of the d-amino acid at position P3.\n",

However, it seems as if even larger substituents could fit in the S3 pocket. A weakness of NAPAP was its inadequate selectivity compared to the digestive enzyme trypsin. Luckily, the structures of NAPAP in complex with thrombin and also with trypsin are known (Fig.23.12). A comparison of the 3D structures shows that there is a significant difference in the binding mode between the two enzymes in the S3 pocket that leads to a 180\u00b0-flipped orientation of the naphthyl group about the bond to sulfur. In thrombin, the S3 pocket is more pronounced and is surrounded by multiple lipophilic amino acid side chains. In trypsin the top end of this pocket is open, and is spatially hardly restricted at all. Obviously its structuring is not necessary in the largely unspecific digestive enzyme. Therefore, the selectivity can be increased by occupying the S3 pocket of thrombin as optimally as possible. If the thrombin\u2013NAPAP complex is examined in more detail, it is apparent that an additional methoxy substituent on the naphthyl ring should be suitable to enhance selectivity. In fact, inhibitor 23.12 binds 600-fold more strongly to thrombin than to trypsin.\n",

Benzamidine was known to be a weak thrombin inhibitor that occupies the S1 pocket. It has, however, the disadvantage that it binds more strongly to trypsin (Fig.23.4). Accordingly, the researchers in Basel initially sought a small molecule that binds more strongly to thrombin than trypsin. More than 200 small molecules were tested in this narrowly focused search. Structures were chosen only if their functional groups were able to interact with the negatively charged side chain of Asp189. Guanidines, amidines, and amines were investigated. N-Amidinopiperidine (23.13, Fig.23.13) was identified as an interesting lead structure. In contrast to benzamidine, amidinopiperidine binds more strongly to thrombin (K\ni = 150 \u03bcm) than to trypsin (K\ni = 300 \u03bcm). A systematic derivatization led to 23.14, a moderately active thrombin inhibitor (K\ni = 0.48 \u03bcm). Based on the structural model with the protease, it appeared obvious that the replacement of the glycine unit with a d-amino acid, for example, d-Phe, should fill a lipophilic pocket and lead to a distinct increase in the affinity. The compound was quickly prepared and tested. In fact, 23.15 bound tenfold more strongly to thrombin. Other d-amino acids were then investigated and additional affinity could be achieved. High selectivity against trypsin was also encouraging; 23.16 binds 840-fold more strongly to thrombin than to trypsin. The surprise was great when the 3D structure of 23.14 in complex with thrombin was determined: The compound binds differently than predicted in the binding pocket! In contrast to the original assumption, the naphthylsulfonyl group exchanged positions with the benzyl side chain.\n",

The compound is a double prodrug of the actual active substance melagatran. Its relation to the initial parent structures (e.g., the tripeptide sequence d-Phe\u2013Pro\u2013Arg) is still quite apparent. The head group of the arginine residue was replaced with a benzamidine, the five-membered ring of the proline was narrowed to a four-membered ring, and the terminal benzyl group was shortened to a cyclohexyl ring. The N terminus was substituted with a methylenecarboxylic acid group. It proved to be extremely difficult to make the thrombin inhibitors adequately bioavailable and to maintain the necessary plasma level over an acceptable length of time. With regard to the bioavailability, AstraZeneca, in collaboration with the group of Bernd Clement at the University of Kiel, pursued a double prodrug strategy: The terminal acid function was masked as an ester, and the benzamidine group was transformed into an N-hydroxyamidine. The release of the active substance, melagatran, in the body is made possible by ubiquitously present esterases and a set of three reductases. AstraZenecca withdrew Ximelagatran (Exanta\u00ae) after 2 years because some issues with liver toxicity were observed in a small number of cases after weeks of use.",

They both have an aspartic acid on the bottom of their deep S1 pockets, similarly to thrombin. Moreover, a narrow and deep S3 pocket that is flanked by aromatic amino acids (Tyr99, Trp215, and Phe174) is specific to factor Xa. Therefore, this pocket is ideally suited for aromatic groups on inhibitors. As already mentioned, in the mid-1990s a dogma prevailed that the S1 pocket of trypsin-like serine proteases could only accept groups with basic character. The binding of chloro-substituted aromatic portions, however, could be demonstrated for thrombin at Merck & Co. in the USA. These groups made a breakthrough for factor Xa inhibitors. Highly potent inhibitors could be developed with chlorophenyl, chloronaphthyl, or chlorothiophene groups protruding into the S1 pocket. So much affinity was gained by the accommodation of additional groups in the deep, aromatic S3 pocket that these compounds bind to the protease with single-digit-nanomolar values without the benzamidine anchor. Such a derivative was introduced by AstraZeneca (23.30, Fig.23.19). In addition to the development of compounds with chloro-substituted aromatic rings for the S1 pocket, other inhibitors with benzamidine groups were also synthesized as factor Xa inhibitors. However, it is much more difficult to achieve adequate selectivity compared to other trypsin-like serine proteases with these derivatives. Furthermore, they showed similar problems with regard to bioavailability as the thrombin inhibitors. Bayer HealthCare introduced a new factor Xa inhibitor to the market in September 2008, rivaroxaban (Xarelto\u00ae; 23.31, Fig.23.18 and 23.19), that places a chlorothiophene group in the S1 pocket.\n\n",

The previously mentioned compounds that lack a benzamidine group show better bioavailability and good selectivity for factor Xa.

The drug design for these target enzymes has benefitted strongly from the experience gained with the thrombin inhibitors. The concepts learned there are well transferred to the special conditions of these proteins. Tryptase, urokinase, and matriptase belong to this family. Tryptase inhibitors are being investigated for the treatment of asthma, and the two others are target structures for possible cancer therapeutics. Tryptase is a tetramer with four trypsin-like catalytic sites. These sites are separated from one another by several angstroms. To develop selective inhibitors, compounds were designed that carry two benzamidine-like anchor groups and a long enough bridge to link them together. In this way, two of the four sites in the tetrameric tryptase molecule are simultaneously blocked. The disadvantage of this design concept is that the developed inhibitors are very large. They are well over the molecular weight limit of 600 Da, which should not be exceeded for good bioavailability. The protease furin also belongs to the family of serine proteases; however, it adopts the folding of the subtilisin family (10.1007/978-3-642-17907-5_14). It is involved in the maturation of proproteins. In this way, the envelope proteins of viruses are cleaved to transform them into their active form. Its involvement in the \u201carming\u201d of viruses was even reported upon in the tabloid press: In the BILD-Zeitung in Germany on August 28, 2003, furin was referred to as the \u201cthe most brutal protein in the world\u201d that \u201cmakes epidemics a deadly danger for humans and acts like a detonator on a bomb.\u201d Furin and other closely related subtilases cleave particular basic tetrapeptide sequences C-terminally: Arg\u2013X\u2013(Arg/Lys)\u2013Arg-. Many glycoproteins of lipid-enveloped viruses are cleaved at this recognition sequence and consequently activated. An example of this is the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses that contain such cleavage sequences in hemagglutinin, one of the surface glycoproteins. Whether the viruses can be activated depends on the availability of the ubiquitously occurring furin, and this is a prerequisite for the high pathogenic potential of the avian influenza viruses. Other genetic combinations or prerequisites must be fulfilled to convert these viruses to dangerous pathogens for animals and humans. Inhibitors of furin could then contribute to the suppression of \u201carming\u201d of these viruses. However, the translation of such highly charged substrates into inhibitors that meet the common rules for good bioavailability is a tremendous challenge.",

They are quickly degraded by this serine aminopeptidase. Because incretins were already interesting candidates for a diabetes therapy, the idea immediately occurred that the inhibition of DPP IV could be used as a principle for treating type-II diabetes (non-insulin dependent).

Esterases and lipases also have a catalytic triad. Occasionally an aspartate is exchanged for a glutamate in these enzymes. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine acts on many synapses in the vegetative nervous system and is involved in the transmission of nerve impulses. It binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, among others and activates this ion channel (10.1007/978-3-642-17907-5_30).

The release requires a hydrolytic cleavage from the protein. For this a well-placed water molecule in the active site is needed that can initiate the nucleophilic attack on the acyl\u2013enzyme species. Although the structural architecture of transpeptidases and \u03b2-lactamases is very similar, the sequence identity is small. Nonetheless, a transpeptidase has been equipped with the hydrolytic properties of a lactamase by selective mutagenesis! Only a few amino acid exchanges were needed for this. Above all, the hydrophobic amino acids such as phenylalanine and tryptophan are the ones that protect the acyl\u2013enzyme complex from hydrolysis in the transpeptidase. In contrast, polar amino acids such as glutamic acid (Fig.23.24, Glu166) are found in the same positions in the lactamases. In contrast to the transpeptidase\u2019s hydrophobic amino acids, these anchor and activate a water molecule in the correct orientation for nucleophilic attack on the acyl\u2013enzyme complex in the lactamases. As a result, the covalent complex with the penicillin cleavage product that was formed by ring opening in the lactamases is hydrolyzed, but it remains stable in the transpeptidases.\n",

This tumor disease is based on the malignant transformation of plasma cells, the physiological function of which is to produce antibodies for immune defense. Even though bortezomib cannot heal multiple myeloma, its use can extend life of patients for whom other therapies have failed. In multiple myeloma, the plasma cells produce massive amounts of misfolded proteins that must be digested by the proteasome. Therefore these cells need a proteasome that functions optimally; otherwise apoptosis would be induced. Blocking the proteasome function is therefore desirable for such cells. Moreover these cells are significantly more sensitive to bortezomib therapy than normal cells. Some tumor cells also activate a transcription factor, NF-\u03baB, which controls the proliferation and survival of the tumor cells. The proteasome is critical for the activation of NF-\u03baB because it degrades an inhibitor of this transcription factor that acts as a kind of emergency brake on NF-\u03baB. Therefore the inhibition of the proteasome serves to keep NF-\u03baB in its benign form, because its inhibiting binding partner is no longer being degraded. It is possible that bortezomib induces apoptosis of tumor cells in that it stabilizes cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (10.1007/978-3-642-17907-5_26) as well as the tumor-suppressor protein p53.",

Inhibiting their function opens very different therapeutic possibilities, for example, for inflammation, tumor metastasis, bone resorption, and muscle atrophy, or myocardial infarct. Another group is the calcium-dependent calpains, their hydrolytic domain has a very similar folding to papain. They occur in many cells and carry out different functions. Calpains occur in higher concentrations at sites of cell damage such as after traumatic brain injury, stroke, or during the formation of cataracts in the eye. Calpains seem to be regulatory enzymes. For example, they reduce the blood flow through vessels in cases of injury to limit blood loss. During a stroke, this natural protective function unfortunately leads to the contrary situation: Activation of calpains reduces the blood flow, and parts of the brain become ischemic. Destruction of the affected brain cells is the result. Specific inhibitors could counteract the over-functioning of the calpains. Cysteine proteases of the papain family have also been discovered in parasites. The inhibition of cruzipain could be a concept to treat sleeping sickness.

In contrast to other serine and cysteine proteases, the attack occurs from the opposite side, the so-called Si face. The S1 pocket in papain is not prominent, and the P1 group of the substrate is oriented away from the protein. In contrast, all of the neighboring pockets are much more prominent. Interestingly, some of the pockets on the C-terminal side (the primed side, S1\u2032\u2013S4\u2032) of cysteine proteases are strongly structured. This can be exploited for the design of potential inhibitors. Papain prefers substrates with hydrophobic P2 and P3 groups. An aspartate is recognized as a P1 group by caspases of the second folding family. For these reasons, many inhibitors that have been developed for caspases carry a functional group with a carboxylic acid group or a corresponding mimetic at this position. The interaction with the thiol group of the catalytic cysteine is decisive for the binding of cysteine protease inhibitors to their target enzyme. It is interesting that many of the developed inhibitors try to involve the sulfur atom in a covalent bond. Reversible and irreversible head groups have been developed for this purpose. The complex of the inhibitor leupeptin 23.52, a natural product with an aldehyde function, with calpain II is shown in Fig.23.27. This group reacts with the thiol group of cysteine and forms a hemithioacetal. Leupeptin binds with high affinity to many members of the papain family. In addition to the aldehyde head group, many other functionalities (so-called warheads) that can be used to inhibit cysteine proteases are known (Fig.23.28). Such irreversible inhibitors have been developed in cases of viral proteases and have a Michael-acceptor group at their disposal (i.e., 23.53). This reactive group forms an irreversible bond with cysteine and switches the enzyme off permanently. An attempt has been made to develop inhibitors for cathepsins, calpains, and caspases that can form a reversible connection to the thiol group. Most of these structures are derived from aldehydes or ketones (23.53\u201323.57). From a chemical point of view, the caspase inhibitor 23.56 from Vertex is interesting. In a cyclic structure, it combines an aspartate-like side chain for the S1 pocket of the enzyme and a capped aldehyde function in the form of a cyclic acetal. The aldehyde is released as active compound from this prodrug.\n\n",

Nine isoenzymes have been discovered in our genome. They are constructed from four domains and contain a catalytic domain composed of a Cys\u2013His\u2013Asp triad. Their task is the posttranslational modification of proteins (10.1007/978-3-642-17907-5_26), that is, they modify proteins after they have been synthesized in the ribosome. As one aspect, they can carry out the deamination of glutamine residues to glutamate. Furthermore, they catalyze the cross-linking of chain strands on proteins by the transaminase reaction. For this the terminal amino group of a lysine is coupled with a glutamate group with the formation of an isopeptide bond. A proteolytically stable cross-linking results so that transglutaminases can be compared to \u201cbiological glue.\u201d Their reaction is analogous to the cysteine proteases. A nucleophilic cysteine initially forms an acyl\u2013enzyme with the substrate\u2019s glutamine with loss of ammonia, which is cleaved in the next step by the reactive lysine. A protein cross-link is the result. Transaminases take on many tasks in our bodies and above all they stabilize tissue proteins. In the blood coagulation cascade, the transglutaminase factor XIII stabilizes the initially formed clot by cross-linking (Sect. 23.4). Therefore inhibitors for factor XIII could be potent anticoagulants. Other transglutaminases are also being investigated as possible targets for drug development. Transglutaminase-2 (TGT2) plays an important role in celiac disease, which is a type of gluten intolerance. Patients that have this disease are sensitive to gluten, which occurs in many grain products as an adhesive protein. They develop inflammation in the mucous membranes of the small intestines, which leads to the destruction of intestinal epithelial cells and severely limits their ability to extract nutrients from food. Inhibitors of TG2 could represent a therapeutic approach. Inhibitors for transglutaminases can be developed by following analogous principles as in the case of the cysteine protease inhibitors.",

            "text": "\nSerine proteases belong to the class of hydrolyzing enzymes that cleave amide or ester bonds. Depending on where they cleave a peptide chain, they are classified as amino-, carboxy-, or endopeptidases.Three amino acids, a serine, a histidine, and an aspartic acid that reside at quite distant positions in the sequence, are folded in characteristic proximity to one another. The hydroxyl oxygen atom of the serine performs a nucleophilic attack onto the carbonyl carbon atom of the scissile peptide bond. Its nucleophilicity is enhanced by an H-bond to an adjacent imidazole moiety of a histidine.The histidine accepts a proton from the nucleophilic serine OH group and is thereby transposed into a positively charged state. The neighboring aspartate residue compensates for the positive charge. The simultaneously created negative charge on the former carbonyl oxygen is stabilized by NH functions in the H-bond-donating oxyanion hole. Simultaneously, the carbon atom of the cleaving amide bond rearranges to a tetrahedral geometry.Upon release of the N-terminal part of the peptide substrate the C-terminal part remains covalently bound as acyl\u2013enzyme complex. This is finally degraded via a similar mechanism by using a water molecule as a nucleophile.The residues involved can be different; in particular, the nucleophilic serine can be replaced by a threonine or cysteine. The corresponding enzymes are named threonine and cysteine proteases.The peptide chain to be cleaved is primarily recognized in small binding pockets on the protease surface that accommodate the amino acid side chains on the C-terminal end adjacent to the cleavage site. Their composition determines the chemical building blocks required for inhibitor design to develop highly potent ligands for the protease.A number of warhead groups are known to either reversibly or irreversibly block the catalytic serine, threonine, or cysteine residue.The major contribution to binding affinity and ligand specificity is achieved through binding to the S1 pocket next to the cleavage site.Blood coagulation is a highly regulated cascade of serine proteases. Potent inhibitors for antithrombotic therapy have been developed for thrombin and factor Xa, which are located in the last steps of the cascade.Whereas thrombin and factor Xa exhibit deep and well-structured S1 pockets, elastase exhibits a flat S1 pocket. Binding to this pocket contributes much less to the overall affinity of an inhibitor for this protease and the developed compounds all involve the catalytic serine in a reversible covalent attachment.Irreversible inhibition through covalent bond formation with the catalytic serine is followed to block lipases or transpeptidases. The covalent bond formation is achieved by the ring opening of a reactive highly strained lactone or lactam ring. The latter principle is used by the penicillins and cephalosporins.The transglutaminases follow a very similar enzyme mechanism as the cysteine proteases. However, instead of cleaving a peptide bond in the main chain, they form an isopeptide bond between the terminal amino group of a lysine and the carboxylate group of a glutamate. Because these bonds cause a cross-linking between different segments of the polypeptide chain, they can be compared to biological glue making proteins more stable.\n",
