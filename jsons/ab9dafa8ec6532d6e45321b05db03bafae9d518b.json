Methods: We plotted networks using the curative outcome of several studies and specified the relations among the experiments by using mean difference, standardized mean difference, and corresponding 95% credible interval. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to separately rank each therapy on clinical severity score (CSS) and length of hospital stay (LHS). Results: This network meta-analysis included 40 articles from 1995 to 2016 concerning the treatment of bronchiolitis in children. All 7 therapeutic regimens displayed no significant difference to PBO with regard to CSS in our study. Among the 7 therapies, BA performed better than CS. As for LHS, EP and EP \u00b1 HS had an advantage over PBO. Moreover, EP and EP \u00b1 HS were also more efficient than BA. The SUCRA results showed that EP \u00b1 CS is most effective, and EP \u00b1 HS is second most effective with regard to CSS. With regard to LHS, EP \u00b1 HS ranked first, EP \u00b1 CS ranked second, and EP ranked third. Conclusions: We recommend EP \u00b1 CS and EP \u00b1 HS as the first choice for bronchiolitis treatment in children because of their outstanding performance with regard to CSS and LHS.

CS is a type of steroid hormone that is extracted from vertebrates' adrenal cortex or some synthetic analogues of hormones. CS is usually applied to physiologic processes such as protein catabolism, immune response, and so on. 56 It is a widely used intervention, and there are several kinds of HS concentrations, the most common being 3%. Three percent HS plays an important role in treating severe hyponatremia, acutely increased intracranial pressure, and critical care settings. 57 Inhalational HS is believed to have a curative effect on respiratory problems such as bronchiolitis. 58 Based on our research, a combination of these medicines showed a better efficacy than therapy with the use of 1 treatment alone.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 300, "end": 302, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 352, "end": 354, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 691, "end": 693, "text": "56", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 947, "end": 949, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1053, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "EP \u00b1 HS exhibited an outstanding curable effect in previous individual research and MAs. This research reveals that EP \u00b1 HS can successfully reduce LHS and CSS. This conclusion was confirmed by Miraglia Del Giudice et al, 7 who also demonstrated that 3% HS \u00b1 EP was able to decrease symptoms and LHS. A report that claimed that 3% HS \u00b1 EP could improve CSS in infants with mild to moderate viral bronchiolitis 28 also supports our conclusions. Some research also took into consideration the concentration of HS as this may have a significant effect on efficacy. For example, it was demonstrated that 5% HS \u00b1 EP and 3% HS \u00b1 EP had a better performance in improving CSS than 0.9% normal saline. However, 5% HS \u00b1 EP had a stronger potential to reduce clinical severity than 3% HS \u00b1 EP. 37 This reminded us of the importance of concentration and why we should pay more attention to it in clinical practice. EP \u00b1 CS also had a brilliant performance with respect to CSS and LHS. Through the investigation and study of infants with bronchiolitis treated in the emergency department, it was found that dexamethasone (a kind of CS) with EP may effectively reduce LHS. 9 In addition, another study of infants with acute bronchiolitis implied that EP \u00b1 CS (dexamethasone) was significantly different from BA. 10 This is consistent with our conclusions. However, some researches and MAs had contradicting evidence to our results. A study that focused on the inhalation of 7% HS \u00b1 EP for patients with moderate to severe acute bronchiolitis 8 implied that 7% HS \u00b1 EP did not appear to show any significant clinical decrease in CSS compared with 0.9% normal saline \u00b1 EP. Grewal et al 40 conducted a randomized trial of severe bronchiolitis in the emergency department and concluded that 3% HS \u00b1 EP does not significantly reduce CSS compared with normal saline. Similarly, another experiment also could not find any difference in infants with mild bronchiolitis. 17 The above studies did not accord with most published results, but we could not simply omit them. Furthermore, some controversy also exists in the effect of EP \u00b1 CS. An RCT showed that EP \u00b1 CS did not play a role in bronchiolitis management for first-time wheezing infants due to a lack of positive effect on CSS and LHS. 31 This result was not reflected in our SUCRA results, and the inconsistency may be caused by several reasons. First, this NMA synthesized experimental data of HS without the consideration of HS concentration. The curative effect may be sensitive to concentration. Second, there may be some inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence.
