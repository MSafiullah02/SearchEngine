Based on accumulating scientific reports, we have highlighted in this review, the different possible modes of action of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine that could particularly justify its use against viral infections. Considering the global health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, the option of using the drugs and repurposing of old drugs in this instance, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, specifically, hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 could be the best choice.",

Given that there is no cure for COVID-19, the clinical testing of HCQ is urgently needed to ascertain its potency against the virus as this is the current available treatment option.

There are plenty of studies in in vitro and in vivo against different cancers by monotherapy or combination therapy of CQ. Intraperitoneal administration of CQ at 60 mg/kg/day for seven days prolonged tumour growth in mice with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-over expressing glioblastoma xenografts [5] . In another study on glioblastoma xenograft mouse, intracranial 5\u00b5l of a 30mM/day CQ treatment for 17 days significantly reduced the mitotic cells with apoptotic cell number increases through the p53 pathway of apoptotic induction [6, 7] . To support its anticancer regimen, several clinical studies on chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as anti-cancer or anti-tumour drugs, are currently being undertaken",

Further research resulted in the discovery of two chloroquine analogues, sontoquine and primaquine, which were improved and better antimalarial drugs [19] . Studies on these compounds then lead to the discovery of resochin. During World War II, investigations on resochin lead to synthesis CQ. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) sulfate, a derivative of CQ, was first synthesized in 1946 by introducing a hydroxyl group into CQ and was demonstrated to be much less (~40%) toxic than CQ in animals [20, 4] (Fig 1) . It is also believed that HCQ has less blood retinal barrier permeability and is less toxic to retina than CQ [21, 22] .",

The plasma level of the drug or its analogues has been found to reach a peak 4-12h after initial dose. The half-live of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are long, ranging from between 40 to 50 days. Chloroquine analogs have strong affinities to blood constituents, highly protein bound, particularly thrombocytes and granulocytes, which reduces its plasma concentrations. In addition, a major fraction of the chloroquine analogs in plasma is bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin [23, 24, 25] .",

The impending of STING pathway (TLR and cGAS response of interferon genes) results in the attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokines like, TNF, IL6, IL1 (Fig 3) [51, 47] On the other hand, enveloped viruses are trapped within the endoplasmic and TGN vesicles for post-translational modification of its envelope glycoproteins. This process involves proteases and glycosyl-transferases, some of which require a low pH environment. By neutralizing the acidic pH, CQ/HCQ becomes responsible for the deactivation of several enzymes in the vesicles, like, glycosylating enzymes, glycosyltransferases, which in turn are responsible for the inhibition of glycosylation. The inhibition of glycosylation results in the host developing adaptive immune response against the infection [52, 48] and impair the cellular receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV-1 and blocks the fusion with the host cell [53, 22] . In connection, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 also employ ACE2 receptor to enter the host cell [54, 53, 55] .

The proposed use of HCQ for treating COVD-19 infections is based on preliminary preclinical in vitro evidence where these drugs showed antiviral properties against SARS-COV-2[67; 68]. In these studies CQ/HCQ seem to work by interfering with the entry of the virus in human cell membrane and inhibited virus multiplication. There are different views held by clinicians on the safety and efficacy of HCQ for COVID-19. CQ/HCQ have multitude of serious complications of chloroquine analogues are retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, neuromyopathy and myopathy[4]. CQ and HCQ use have not been reported in acute prevention, so their efficacy is unknown, but indicated for therapeutic use.The beneficial impact of hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, three times per day for 10 days for four days) or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg per day for next four days) dependent on viral negativity on day 6 was reported by a non-randomized clinical trial open label in France enrolling COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine (20 patients) or control arms(16 patients)",

They conclude that these patients represented a high risk group for arrhythmia. They further concluded that the development of renal failure in these patients was a course of the extreme QT prolongation.
