So, it should not come as a surprise that the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis was high at 53.5%. There was also a dose\u2013response effect, such that exposure to violence in multiple contexts predicted higher levels of PTSD, social and emotional problems and depression. This supports previous findings that victimization across multiple domains of a child\u2019s life has particularly damaging effects [2]. The cruelty of this finding is that, as a child or young person, where else do you have to go? If you are exposed to violence at school, your neighbourhood and at home, there is no safe haven, no one to trust, and nowhere to hide. If you develop a mental health problem due to such exposures, your chances of getting better decrease for lack of stability and supporting relationships. You will be more prone to bullying or to bully, academic failure, and sexual victimization [3, 4]: the Velcro-effect takes charge.",

Premature connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex is a repeated finding following early traumatisation, across species [5]. The finding is, in very simple terms, interpreted as the individual\u2019s increased focus on survival, at the cost of learning. Functional MRI studies on PTSD indicate that abnormalities in fear learning play an important role in the development of PTSD [6], but we do not quite know what is the chicken and the egg in that equation. Thus, when societies do not manage to protect their youth from violence exposure, especially in multiple contexts, they are in effect messing with society\u2019s future brain power. Add poverty into the mix [7] and the effects on the development, mental health, and productivity of a whole generation is jeopardized.",
