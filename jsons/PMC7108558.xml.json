C-CAM has been independently described by several groups using different designations, e.g., cell-CAM 105, gp110, or Ecto-ATPase/C-CAM (Becker et al., 1985; Odin et al., 1986; Lin and Guidotti, 1989). The human counterpart is known as biliary glycoprotein (BGP) or CD66a (Svenberg et al., 1979; Hinoda et al., 1988).",

            "text": "C-CAM is regarded as a multifunctional molecule. Like other proteins of the Ig-superfamily, it mediates homophilic intercellular adhesion via its extracellular region, as shown in isolated hepatocytes (Odin et al., 1986; Becker et al., 1989; Becker et al., 1993;) and transfected COS 7-, CHO- or insect cells (Lin et al., 1991; Lucka et al., 1995; Olsson et al., 1995). In this process the first N-terminal Ig-like loop structure is the major adhesive component (Cheung et al., 1993). Within this region three potential glycosylation sites exist. The intracellular part of C-CAM interacts with proteins involved in the signal transduction pathway, such as pp60cscr, the insulin receptor kinase, the protein kinase C, and the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (Brummer et al., 1995; Najjar et al., 1995; Beauchemin et al., 1997; Edlund et al., 1998). Furthermore, interaction of both isoforms with calmodulin has been reported (Blikstad et al., 1992; Edlund and \u00d6brink, 1993; Edlund et al., 1996). Most important, tumor suppression activity of C-CAM has been demonstrated in carcinoma cells from rat prostate, bladder, and colon (Hsieh et al., 1995; Kleinerman et al., 1996; Turbide et al., 1997). In addition, C-CAM has been shown to bind bacteria and viruses (Leusch et al., 1991; Williams et al., 1991; Dveksler et al., 1993; Virji et al., 1996; Gray-Owen et al., 1997), and its involvement in the binding and transport of bile salts from hepatocytes into the bile has been suggested (M\u00fcller et al., 1991; Sippel et al., 1993).",

The primary sequence of rat C-CAM contains 15 potential N-glycosylation consensus sites (Lin and Guidotti, 1989), but so far no detailed structural characterization of N-linked rat C-CAM glycan chains has been reported. Digestion with oligosaccharide-specific enzymes showed that rat liver C-CAM exists as numerous glycoforms. Desialylation reduced the Mr from 110 k to \u223c90 k, while PNGaseF-treatment shifted the Mr to \u223c50 k. EndoH had no effect, indicating the absence of high-mannose type oligosaccharides (Becker et al., 1993).

Due to the relatively low resolution of this chromatographic system, no separation of sugars differing in the linkage of the terminal galactose residues was achieved. The two main fractions eluted at positions corresponding to 11.1 and 14 glucose units, which is consistent with the presence of bi-and triantennary glycans. The corresponding fucosylated sugars were eluted at positions corresponding to approximately 12.1 and 15 glucose units. Four sugar fractions containing bi- and triantennary glycans with or without fucose were analyzed by enzymatic sequencing. Two dimensional HPLC was applied as a high resolution chromatographic system to obtain individual glycans. Separation of desialylated 2-AB-labeled glycans using NH2-HPLC yielded 13 fractions designated F1-F13 (Figure 1).",

The results revealed that C-CAM carried bi- and triantennary sugars with antennae consisting of GlcNAc\u03b21-3/4Gal, and that fucose is bound to the core region of the glycans. Only 2,2,4 but no 2,2,6 linked triantennary sugars were detected. To specify the linkage of terminally bound galactose residues as well as the linkage of the subterminal N-acetylglucosamine to the trimannosyl core, glycan fractions obtained by RP-HPLC were digested with a mixture of \u03b21-4-galactosidase and \u03b2-N-acetylhexosaminidase. The reaction products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS and for some sugars by P4 gel permeation chromatography. Treatment of fraction F3 yielded two sugars with m/z values of 1786 (biantennary glycan) and 1421 (biantennary glycan minus a lactosamine unit). Thus two isomeric biantennary glycans eluted in fraction F3 carrying one or two units of GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal (type I chain) in the antennae (Table III, F3.1 and F3.2). The main compound in fraction F4 was found to be a biantennary sugar with two antennae consisting of two GlcNAc\u03b21-4Gal (type II chain), but an isomer with one type I chain antenna was also detected. P4 gel permeation chromatography was used to determine the ratio of these fragments in fractions F3 and F4. The linkage of the type I and II chain antennae to the 3- or 6-linked mannose in the core of the oligosaccharide was not examined. Two fucosylated biantennary structures carrying one or two type II chains were found for sugars eluted in F5 and F6.2. Mass spectrometry of the digested fractions F7, F8, F9, and F10 resulted in ions which could be interpreted as isomers of triantennary sugars. A signal at m/z 1786 detected for fraction F7 revealed a loss of one lactosamine unit consistent with a 2,2,4 branched-triantennary sugar with two type I chains in the antennae. The main fraction, F8, yielded a signal at m/z 1421; this indicates the loss of two lactosamine units from a triantennary glycan carrying one GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal antenna which is 1\u20134-linked to mannose. Two digestion products were detected for fraction F9. The signal of m/z 1421 (F9.1) was again consistent with a fragment generated from a digested 2,2,4 branched-triantennary sugar with two type II sugar chains. A second isomer carrying three type II chains was deduced from the m/z value of 1259 recorded for fraction 9.2. The ratio of these fragments was determined by P4 gel permeation chromatography. Mass spectrometric data of exoglycosidase treated glycans F7, F8, and F9.1 suggested that one antennae of the type I chain is 1\u20134-linked to mannose.",

Spik et al. (1991) and Baussant et al. (1992) also detected oversialylation in biantennary N-glycans of rat plasma glycoproteins in type I chains attached to the \u03b11,3-linked mannose. This corresponds to our findings, as oligosaccharide F3.1 was found to be maximally trisialylated but not tetrasialylated, although it contains two type I chains. In contrast, Cumming et al. (1989) detected the NeuAc-\u03b12,3Gal\u03b21,3(NeuAc\u03b12,6)GlcNAc\u03b21-chain in many structures of bovine fetuin, including the Man\u03b11,6-antennae, but with marked preference for the Man\u03b11,3-bound chain. Krotkiewski et al. (1990) found oversialylation of triantennary N-glycan exclusively in type I-chain linked to the C4-position of the 2,4-disubstituted mannose in a mouse monoclonal antibody. These findings agree with our results, as all the oversialylated triantennary structures we found (F7, F8, F9.1, F11, and F12.1) exhibit a type I chain linked to the C4-position of the 2,4-disubstituted mannose (Gal\u03b21,3GlcNAc\u03b21,4Man\u03b11,3-chain). Triantennary structures with type II chains bound at \u03b21,4-position to mannose were not oversialylated, even when they possessed type I chains in \u03b21,2-linkage to mannose (F9.2, F10).",

The substrate specificity of \u03b12,6-sialyltransferase for type II oligosac-terminal \u03b2-Gal and the 2-amido group of the neighboring GlcNAc charides is explained by the requirement for the 6-hydroxyl of the for the transfer of Neu5Ac (Wlasichuk et al., 1993). In contrast, the \u03b12,3-sialyltransferase accepts type I and type II chains as substrates, also when the 2- and 6- positions of the GlcNAc are modified by different substituents. Paulson et al. (1984) identified an N-acetylglucosaminide (\u03b12\u20136)-sialyltransferase in Golgi apparatus from rat liver. This sialyltransferase had a marked preference for the sequence NeuAc\u03b12,3Gal\u03b21,3GlcNAc\u03b21- as an acceptor substrate. Sialylation of the type I antennae Gal\u03b21,3GlcNAc1- was also demonstrated in vitro. However, this sialyltransferase has not been characterized or cloned to date.",

High expression of type I chains may prevent unwanted crosslinking of soluble C-CAM with the asialoglycoprotein receptor, since oligosaccharides containing \u03b21,3-linked Gal interact poorly with the asialoglycoprotein receptor, compared with those containing \u03b21,4-linked Gal (Townsend et al., 1986). It remains to be shown whether glycosylation of soluble C-CAM corresponds to glycosylation of membrane bound C-CAM. However, the shielding of potential protease cleavage sites by the high degree of glycosylation and the high sialic acid content may be one reason for the long half life of C-CAM (\u223c50 h) in rat liver (Becker, 1989).",
