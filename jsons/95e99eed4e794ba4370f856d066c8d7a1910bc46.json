They mostly cause enteric or respiratory disease, which can be severe and life threatening, e.g., in the case of the zoonotic coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in humans. Despite the economic and societal impact of such coronavirus infections, and the likelihood of future outbreaks of additional pathogenic coronaviruses, our options to prevent or treat coronavirus infections remain very limited. This highlights the importance of advancing our knowledge on the replication of these viruses and their interactions with the host. Compared to other +RNA viruses, coronaviruses have an exceptionally large genome and employ a complex genome expression strategy. Next to a role in basic virus replication or virus assembly, many of the coronavirus proteins expressed in the infected cell contribute to the coronavirus-host interplay. For example, by interacting with the host cell to create an optimal environment for coronavirus replication, by altering host gene expression or by counteracting the host's antiviral defenses. These coronavirus-host interactions are key to viral pathogenesis and will ultimately determine the outcome of infection. Due to the complexity of the coronavirus proteome and replication cycle, our knowledge of host factors involved in coronavirus replication is still in an early stage compared to what is known for some other +RNA viruses.

Accelerated by air travel, the disease rapidly spread to several parts of the world and displayed pandemic potential. SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the causative agent of this zoonotic infection (Drosten et al. 2003; Ksiazek et al. 2003; Kuiken et al. 2003; Peiris et al. 2003) , which resulted in >8000 laboratory-confirmed cases and 774 associated deaths worldwide (WHO 2004) . Although in terms of death toll not comparable to influenza, HIV or HCV, the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak caused worldwide public concern and seriously affected the global economy [estimated losses $30-100 billion; (Keogh-Brown and Smith 2008) ]. SARS-CoV initially causes lower respiratory tract disease, which can lead to a progressive and potentially lethal atypical pneumonia with clinical symptoms that include fever, malaise, lymphopenia, and in some cases also diarrhea. Two years after the outbreak, horseshoe bats were identified as the likely reservoir of the SARS virus, whereas civet cats probably have served as intermediate host during the zoonotic transfer to humans Li et al. 2005b ). Adaptation to the human host required a small number of mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein, which mediates cell binding and entry (Li et al. 2005c ) (see Chap. 2). There is increasing evidence that SARS-like coronaviruses continue to circulate in bats and that these may have the potential to readily cross the species barrier and emerge as human pathogens (Ge et al. 2013; Menachery et al. 2015) .

Synthesis of pp1ab, a C-terminally extended form of pp1a, involves a -1 ribosomal frameshift (RFS) into ORF1b occurring near the 3\u2032 end of ORF1a. This regulatory mechanism is thought to have evolved to downregulate expression levels of ORF1b-encoded proteins compared to ORF1a-encoded nonstructural proteins (nsps) (Brierley and Dos Ramos 2006; Brierley et al. 1989 ). Ultimately, 15 or 16 mature replicase proteins are released from pp1a and pp1ab due to proteolytic cleavages performed by two or three ORF1a-encoded proteases. Nsp3 contains one or two papain-like protease domains (PL1 pro and PL2 pro , or PL pro for SARS-CoV and infectious bronchitis virus) that process the nsp1-4 part of the replicase polyproteins. The remaining cleavage sites are processed by the viral main protease that resides in nsp5, a chymotrypsin-like enzyme also known as 3C-like protease . A schematic overview of the proteolytic processing and domain structure of the SARS-CoV replicase is presented in Fig. 1b . The replicase proteins contain a variety of (enzymatic) activities and functions that are required for viral RNA synthesis and capping (Perlman and Netland 2009; Snijder et al. 2016) , such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; nsp12), a helicase (nsp13), RNA cap-modifying methyltransferases (nsp14 and nsp16), and an exoribonuclease (nsp14). Together with recruited host cell proteins, the coronavirus nsps form membrane-associated replication and transcription complexes [RTCs; (van Hemert et al. 2008)] , which localize to a network of virus-induced membrane structures in the perinuclear region of the infected cell (Knoops et al. 2008; Gosert et al. 2002; van der Meer et al. 1999; Brockway et al. 2003; Stertz et al. 2007; Ulasli et al. 2010 ).

For SARS-CoV, fusion of the viral and cellular membrane is triggered upon cleavage of the S protein by the cell surface-associated transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) (Glowacka et al. 2011) . The same protease is important for cleavage and activation of the HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S protein (Shirato et al. 2013; Bertram et al. 2013) . After endocytosis, the SARS-CoV S protein is cleaved by the lysosomal proteases cathepsin L and cathepsin P in early endosomes, leading to fusion of the virus envelop with the endosome membranes and release of the viral RNA into the cytosol of the infected cell (Huang et al. 2006a, b; Simmons et al. 2005) . MERS-CoV entry occurs by a similar mechanism (Shirato et al. 2013; Burkard et al. 2014) , although inhibition of the cellular protease furin abolished the entry of MERS-CoV but not SARS-CoV, indicating that furin-mediated cleavage is pivotal (Burkard et al. 2014; Follis et al. 2006 ). On the other hand, MHV strain A59 was shown to fuse with late endosomes and to depend on their low pH for S protein cleavage (Burkard et al. 2014) . Therefore, it has been proposed that coronavirus fusion with endosomes depends on the use of a furin cleavage site just upstream of the fusion peptide (Burkard et al. 2014 ). However, why some coronaviruses fuse with early endosomes and others with late endosomes, and whether these events play a role in host tropism and pathogenicity, is still not completely understood (Burkard et al. 2014) .

Subsequently, cleaved MERS-CoV S proteins could be processed by proteases on recipient cells and virions could enter the cells via early endosomes or even by fusing with the plasma membrane.

After mRNA binding, this 43S complex serves as a scaffold for the recruitment of several additional proteins, including eIF3, to the capped 5\u2032 end of the mRNA. Subsequently, the cap-binding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) joins this pre-initiation complex (48S complex), which then scans the mRNA in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction to localize a translation initiation codon. At this point, the 60S ribosomal subunit joins and protein synthesis starts [reviewed in ]. Polyadenine-binding protein (PABP), which binds to the poly(A)-tail of mRNAs, is also involved in stimulating protein synthesis. The eIF2 complex can be inactivated by phosphorylation of its alpha subunit (eIF2a) by one of four mammalian kinases in response to various (external) triggers.

Coronaviruses have evolved various strategies to counteract PKR-mediated signaling in order to prevent the translational shut-off due to eIF2a phosphorylation. For example, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) appears to (weakly) antagonize PKR by blocking its activation as well as inducing the expression of growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 34 protein (GADD34), leading to reduced eIF2a phosphorylation in IBV-infected cells ).

Recently, the MERS-CoV ORF4a protein was shown to counteract the PKR-induced formation of stress granules, probably by binding viral dsRNA to shield it from detection by PKR, thereby preventing translational inhibition (Rabouw et al. 2016) . Also transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been reported to modulate host cell translation, in this case through its protein 7, which promotes eIF2a dephosphorylation through an interaction with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a key regulator of the host's antiviral response (Cruz et al. 2011) .

This is an intriguing kind of virus-host interaction and the architecture of these 'replication organelles' has now been studied in detail for quite a number of viruses. Nevertheless, their exact functions have remained largely obscure. In general, two types of +RNA virus-induced membrane structures have been recognized [recently reviewed by (van der Hoeven et al. 2016) ]. The first type is characterized by single-membrane spherules, invaginations with a negative curvature formed in the membranes of organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), peroxisomes, or endosomes, with the source of the membrane depending on the virus under study. The viral replication machinery is located within these spherules and RNA products are exported through a channel that connects the spherule's interior and the cytosol, so that they can engage in translation or particle assembly. Flaviviruses and alphaviruses are examples of virus families inducing the formation of this type of replication organelles [reviewed in (den Boon and Ahlquist 2010)]. The second type of replication structures, which includes those found in coronavirus-infected cells, is dominated by double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), often accompanied by other structures such as tubules, zippered ER and/or convoluted membranes, together forming a reticulovesicular network in the cytosol (Knoops et al. 2008; Maier et al. 2013; Ulasli et al. 2010; Hagemeijer et al. 2012; Gosert et al. 2002) (Fig. 1c) .

It is generally thought that viral nsps that have transmembrane regions, or are otherwise anchored to membranes, drive the formation of these structures.

Much of this data is still under debate though, making it quite difficult to formulate a consensus theory. The involvement of ER membranes seems to be generally accepted and is supported by the presence of ribosomes and ER markers such as sec61a and protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) on the surface of or inside virus-induced double-membrane structures, and the fact that the outer membrane of coronavirus-induced DMVs can be continuous with ER cisternae (Hagemeijer et al. 2014; Knoops et al. 2008 Knoops et al. , 2010 Snijder et al. 2006 ). In accordance with this link to the ER, studies by de Haan and co-workers (Oostra et al. 2007; Verheije et al. 2008) suggested that the secretory pathway, including coatomer protein (COP)-dependent processes and associated factors such as GBF-1, plays an important role in replication. However, no co-localization was observed between nsp4, a marker for the coronavirus-induced membrane structures, and secretory pathway markers. These observations are in agreement with the results of our own siRNA screen for host factors influencing SARS-CoV replication, which identified COPB2 (or b\u2032-COP), a subunit of the coatomer protein complex, as a strong proviral (or 'dependency') factor (de Wilde et al. 2015) . Depletion of COPB1 and GBF1, which are part of this same machinery, also severely affected SARS-CoV replication, confirming that the integrity of the secretory pathway is important for replication (de Wilde et al. 2015; Knoops et al. 2010 ). Several reports have described the importance of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PI4Ks) in +RNA virus replication, which was first discovered through siRNA screens searching for cellular factors important for picornavirus and hepatitis C virus replication (Reiss et al. 2011; Hsu et al. 2010; Berger et al. 2009 ). These kinases seem to be recruited to the sites of membrane modification and stimulate the production of PI4P lipids, which together supports the formation and/or functionality of viral replication structures. The underlying mechanism is not exactly clear yet, and several hypotheses have been put forward [reviewed in (Altan-Bonnet and Balla 2012)]. Also for SARS-CoV replication one of the PI4K isoforms, PI4KIIIbeta, was shown to be important (Yang et al. 2012) , although it seems to play a role in entry rather than later steps of the replication cycle.

Some reports suggested that coronaviruses hijack the autophagy machinery for DMV biogenesis in support of their replication (de Haan and Reggiori 2008; Prentice et al. 2004; Maier and Britton 2012) . However, another study showed that the essential autophagy factor Atg5 is not required at all for coronavirus replication in primary cells ). Molinari and co-workers then proposed that so-called EDEMosomes are being hijacked for the formation of coronavirus membrane structures . These EDEMosomes are defined as single-membrane vesicles that pinch off from the ER to remove ERAD regulators (like EDEM1 and OS-9) when this is needed to tune the ERAD machinery (Cali et al. 2008) . The process seems a deviation from the autophagy pathway, with the EDEMosomes accumulating LC3-I, a form that is inactive in the canonical autophagy pathway. Reggiori and co-workers claimed that coronaviruses hijack these vesicles to form their reticulovesicular network, and this hypothesis was later extended to arteriviruses (Monastyrska et al. 2013 ). However, several questions have remained unanswered and other published data appear to be at odds with the EDEMosome hypothesis. For example, it has remained entirely unclear how the small single-membrane EDEMosome vesicles would be converted into the elaborate network of (much larger) DMVs, convoluted membranes (CM), and other structures that are typical of coronavirus-infected cells. Furthermore, EDEMosomes have been characterized as alternative transport vesicles that explicitly are not associated with COP-coats and are independent of the canonical secretory pathway, which-as Reggiori and co-workers argued-may explain why secretory pathway markers do not localize to replication membranes . Nonetheless, the integrity of the secretory pathway and the function of COP components clearly influences coronavirus replication (Verheije et al. 2008; Oostra et al. 2007; Knoops et al. 2010; de Wilde et al. 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 366, "end": 387, "text": "Prentice et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 388, "end": 411, "text": "Maier and Britton 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 873, "end": 891, "text": "(Cali et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1246, "text": "(Monastyrska et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 2082, "end": 2104, "text": "(Verheije et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 2105, "end": 2124, "text": "Oostra et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 2125, "end": 2144, "text": "Knoops et al. 2010;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2145, "end": 2166, "text": "de Wilde et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Coronavirus-Induced Modification of Host Cell Membranes"}, {"text": "All in all, although a variety of studies addressed the possible host pathways and factors involved in the formation and function of the replication-associated membrane structures, our understanding of coronavirus replication organelle biogenesis is still far from complete.

In addition, by using an RNA-affinity purification and mass spectrometry approach, Galan et al. (2009) identified several hnRNPs that bind the 3\u2032-terminal *500 nucleotides of the TGEV genome. Several of these are presumed RNA-binding proteins for other coronaviruses and were proposed to play a role in viral RNA synthesis (Table 2) . However, the exact function and relevance of hnRNPs and other RNA-binding proteins in coronavirus replication is still not fully understood. The majority of RNA-binding proteins were identified in co-immunoprecipitation studies that made In vitro pull-down (Li et al. 1997; Zhang and Lai 1995; Furuya and Lai 1993) Binds the MHV 3\u2032-UTR, may mediate RNP formation to bind 5\u2032end and 3\u2032end of the MHV genome together with PTB.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 432, "end": 451, "text": "(Nanda et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 452, "end": 477, "text": "Nanda and Leibowitz 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 563, "end": 581, "text": "(Galan et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 679, "end": 704, "text": "(Spagnolo and Hogue 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF174"}, {"start": 705, "end": 723, "text": "Galan et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 724, "end": 742, "text": "Emmott et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 855, "end": 869, "text": "(Enjuanes 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 956, "end": 975, "text": "Galan et al.

Interestingly, however, Shen and Masters (Shen and Masters 2001) showed that MHV replicates equally well in hnRNP A1 \u2212/\u2212 CB3 cells and parental CB3 cells, which lack and express hnRNP A1, respectively. This strongly suggests that hnRNP A1 itself is not pivotal for MHV replication. On the other hand, Lai and co-workers showed that multiple hnRNPs can bind to the same viral RNA and postulated that hnRNPs may be able to functionally substitute each other in MHV infection (Shi et al. 2003) . These apparent contradictions also highlight the technical complexity of dissecting the precise role of RNA-binding proteins in coronavirus replication. On a different level, RNA-binding proteins were investigated as potential modulators of the efficiency of the coronavirus ORF1a/1b frameshift event during replicase gene translation. For example, annexin A2 binds the IBV slippery sequence, on which ribosomes are repositioned and engage in expression of ORF1b. Host proteins may also affect the activity of the viral RTC indirectly.

Many viruses have evolved strategies to suppress and/or evade these (innate) immune responses, which can dramatically influence the course of the infection, including pathogenesis and persistence in the host. In the case of +RNA viruses, the innate immune system is often triggered by the dsRNA and 5\u2032-triphosphate-bearing RNA molecules that arise as replication intermediates in the cytosol. These molecules are foreign to the cell and can be recognized by the intracellular sensors of the Rig-I-like receptor (RLR) family, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5) which are expressed in almost all cells [reviewed in (Wilkins and Gale 2010; Bruns and Horvath 2014) ]. For recognition of coronavirus RNAs, MDA-5 seems the most important cytosolic sensor Zalinger et al. 2015; Kindler and Thiel 2014) , although in some cell types RIG-I also seems to play a role . Also the toll-like receptors which are expressed on the cell surface or reside in the endosomes of immune cells can recognize viral nucleic acids or proteins. TLR3 plays a role in the recognition of coronaviruses (Totura et al. 2015; Mazaleuskaya et al. 2012) and also TLR4 was shown to be relevant during MHV infection in mice (Khanolkar et al. 2009) . Recently it was shown that the SARS-CoV M protein is recognized via a TLR-like pathway that is independent of the canonical TRAF3-mediated signaling pathway (Wang and Liu 2016 ). Activation of one or more of these sensors generally leads to the activation of the transcription factors IFN-regulatory factor 3 and 7 (IRF3, IRF7) and NF-jB. These stimulate the expression and excretion of Type-I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn activate the JAK-STAT signaling cascade that induces the expression of a myriad of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). This ultimately results in an antiviral state of the infected cell, as well as neighboring cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 892, "end": 915, "text": "(Wilkins and Gale 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF210"}, {"start": 916, "end": 939, "text": "Bruns and Horvath 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1049, "text": "Zalinger et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1073, "text": "Kindler and Thiel 2014)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1371, "text": "(Totura et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF187"}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1397, "text": "Mazaleuskaya et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1489, "text": "(Khanolkar et al. 2009)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1649, "end": 1667, "text": "(Wang and Liu 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF204"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Host Innate Immune Responses Against Coronaviruses, and Viral Countermeasures"}, {"text": "ISGs were shown to target virtually all steps of the viral cycle in order to restrict viral replication (Schoggins and Rice 2011). The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play a role in the induction of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and were linked to countering coronavirus infections through several studies [reviewed in (Mizutani 2007) ]. IBV has evolved a strategy to counteract IL-6 and IL-8 expression by inducing the expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), a negative regulator of p38 MAPK, although it has remained unclear which viral protein(s) is responsible (Liao et al. 2011) . Innate immune and inflammatory signaling pathways are extensively regulated in order to prevent adverse effects of their over-stimulation. Apart from phosphorylation and other regulatory mechanisms, the system is controlled by ubiquitination at numerous points in the signal transduction cascade. For example, RIG-I, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) were shown to be activated by Lys63-linked ubiquitination (Jiang and Chen 2012) . The importance of the innate immune system in the context of coronavirus infections can be illustrated in at least three ways. First, in severe cases of SARS the pathology was associated with aberrant or hyper-activation of innate immune signaling. This resulted in the aberrant production of interferons and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL-10 and TNF-alpha in the lungs [reviewed in (Totura and Baric 2012) ]. Interestingly, a systems biology study that evaluated the transcriptome after infection of cultured cells with two different human MERS-CoV isolates (MERS-CoV Eng 1 vs. SA 1) suggested that viral sequence differences relate to variations in innate immune evasion, which may in turn result in different immune responses. These differences may link to differential STAT3 activation leading to activation or inhibition of, e.g., IFN, NF-jB, and IRF7 (Selinger et al. 2014 ). Second, as described in Chap. 4, coronaviruses employ elaborate mechanisms to shield the viral replication machinery from the innate immune sensors in the cytosol. Third, besides the presumed shielding of viral PAMPs by the replication organelles, coronaviruses seem to encode numerous gene products that actively counteract or help to circumvent innate immune responses [reviewed in (Totura and Baric 2012; Kindler and Thiel 2014; Vijay and Perlman 2016) ].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 341, "end": 356, "text": "(Mizutani 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 601, "end": 619, "text": "(Liao et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1093, "text": "(Jiang and Chen 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1544, "text": "(Totura and Baric 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 1995, "end": 2016, "text": "(Selinger et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF161"}, {"start": 2404, "end": 2427, "text": "(Totura and Baric 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 2428, "end": 2451, "text": "Kindler and Thiel 2014;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2452, "end": 2475, "text": "Vijay and Perlman 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF198"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Host Innate Immune Responses Against Coronaviruses, and Viral Countermeasures"}, {"text": "To illustrate the multitude of activities coronaviruses employ to actively suppress innate immunity, and the diversity of viral gene products involved, some examples are discussed below. First, besides inhibiting cellular mRNA translation (see paragraph above), SARS-CoV nsp1 was shown to block IFN signaling by reducing the amount of phosphorylated STAT1 (p-STAT1) in infected cells (Wathelet et al. 2007) . Also nsp1 proteins of other alpha-and betacoronaviruses were shown to inhibit type-I IFN signaling, mostly through the host-shut-off activity of this N-terminal subunit of the coronavirus replicase polyprotein (reviewed in Narayanan et al. 2015) . Further downstream in the pp1a polyprotein, the papain-like protease 2 domain (PL2 pro ) of many coronaviruses and the TGEV PL1 pro domain, which reside in nsp3, exhibit deubiquitination (DUB) activity in biochemical experiments [reviewed in (Mielech et al. 2014) ]. This DUB activity may remove ubiquitin from innate immune signaling factors to suppress the induction of an antiviral state, and indeed was shown to reduce IFN signaling in biochemical experiments using PL2 pro overexpression for several coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV (Matthews et al. 2014a; ) and MERS-CoV Clementz et al. 2010; Bailey-Elkin et al. 2014) . Similarly, experiments suggested that MHV PL2 pro deubiquitinates and binds TBK1, as well as IRF3 (Zheng et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2011) . For the distantly related arterivirus EAV, infection with a mutant lacking a similar papain-like protease-driven DUB activity resulted in an increased innate immune response after infection, indicating that the viral DUB activity indeed has a function in suppression of innate immune response during infection (van Kasteren et al. 2013) . Adjacent to the PL2 pro domain, some coronaviruses contain a domain originally coined 'SARS-CoV unique domain' (SUD). The two domains together were recently also implicated in innate immune suppression by binding and stimulating a cellular ubiquitin E3 ligase, RCHY1, resulting in augmented degradation of p53 (Ma-Lauer et al. 2016 ). The main protease, nsp5, of PEDV was shown to cleave NEMO, an important innate immune regulator protein . When independently expressed, coronavirus nsp6, which is probably one of the most hydrophobic proteins encoded in the genome, seems to induce and/or influence autophagy. However the relevance of this observation for virus-infected cells and possible links to innate immune responses against coronaviruses remain to be investigated (Cottam et al. 2014; Cottam et al. 2011) . A conserved domain in the coronavirus nsp16 directs 2\u2032-O methylation of the viral RNA, thereby preventing its recognition by MDA5 Zust et al. 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 384, "end": 406, "text": "(Wathelet et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF208"}, {"start": 632, "end": 654, "text": "Narayanan et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 899, "end": 920, "text": "(Mielech et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 1196, "end": 1219, "text": "(Matthews et al. 2014a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 1235, "end": 1256, "text": "Clementz et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1282, "text": "Bailey-Elkin et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1402, "text": "(Zheng et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF238"}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1420, "text": "Wang et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF206"}, {"start": 1733, "end": 1759, "text": "(van Kasteren et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF195"}, {"start": 2072, "end": 2093, "text": "(Ma-Lauer et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 2534, "end": 2554, "text": "(Cottam et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2555, "end": 2574, "text": "Cottam et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2707, "end": 2724, "text": "Zust et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF240"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Host Innate Immune Responses Against Coronaviruses, and Viral Countermeasures"}, {"text": "Besides conserved replicase subunits, also several of the less-conserved products of downstream open reading frames, i.e., the so-called 'accessory proteins', have innate immunity suppressing features. In fact, these proteins may have been acquired by different coronavirus lineages for this purpose, since they are generally dispensable for replication in cell culture. The phosphodiesterase (ns2) encoded by ORF2a in MHV and related viruses antagonizes RNAse L activation, and this was show to be important for replication in natural host cells (Zhao et al. 2012; Li and Weiss 2016) . Observations supporting a role in blocking IFN production and/or signaling were also made for the ORF3b and ORF6 proteins of SARS-CoV (Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2007 ) and the ORF3b proteins of other SARS-like coronaviruses (Zhou et al. 2012) . Also the proteins encoded by MERS-CoV ORFs 4a, 4b and 5 (Siu et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2013; Niemeyer et al. 2013; Matthews et al. 2014b ) all seem to block IFN signaling, although many of the initial reports were based only on overexpression experiments, which should be interpreted with caution. Recently however, more insight into the mechanisms by which some of these viral proteins suppress antiviral responses was obtained. Like MHV ns2 (see above), the MERS-CoV ORF4b protein and its homologs from other betacoronaviruses were shown to have phosphodiesterase activity. They can block activation of the RNAse L-mediated innate immune response during infection by degrading 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate, which is the activator of RNAse L (Thornbrough et al. 2016) . Additionally, MERS-CoV ORF4a prevents activation of the PKR-stress granule route by binding dsRNA, in the context of an infection (Rabouw et al. 2016) . The SARS-CoV ORF6 protein was shown to block p-STAT1 import into the nucleus by interacting with the nuclear pore, and this block was suggested to reduce innate immune responses and the expression of genes that affect virus-induced pathogenesis Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2007; Huang et al. 2015a ). Interestingly, MERS-CoV, along with the other coronaviruses not belonging to the SARS-CoV cluster, lacks an ORF6 homolog, and since MERS-CoV is also more sensitive to treatment with type-I interferons, it was hypothesized that this couldin part-be explained by this difference (de Wilde et al. 2013b) . Also the coronaviral structural proteins seem to possess innate immunity-modulating activities, although also here most studies involved overexpression experiments. The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV M proteins bind TRAF3 to prevent its binding to TBK1 and eventually to prevent nuclear translocation of this complex, which blocks IRF3-mediated signaling (Siu et al. 2009; Lui et al. 2016) . Overexpression experiments showed a negative impact of the SARS-CoV N protein on (the early stages of) innate immune signaling (Frieman et al. 2009; Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2007; Lu et al. 2011) . MHV N protein also seems to counteract type-I IFN signaling, and could do this in the context of a recombinant vaccinia virus infection (Ye et al. 2007 ). Purified SARS-CoV spike (S) protein stimulates inflammatory and other innate responses, possibly through TLR2 activation (Dosch et al. 2009 ). Finally, the SARS-CoV E protein, is a viroporin, and influences inflammatory processes by boosting the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to IL-1beta overproduction and development of immunopathology in the host (Nieto-Torres et al. 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 547, "end": 565, "text": "(Zhao et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF236"}, {"start": 566, "end": 584, "text": "Li and Weiss 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 721, "end": 750, "text": "(Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 809, "end": 827, "text": "(Zhou et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF239"}, {"start": 886, "end": 903, "text": "(Siu et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF169"}, {"start": 904, "end": 921, "text": "Yang et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF221"}, {"start": 922, "end": 943, "text": "Niemeyer et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 944, "end": 965, "text": "Matthews et al. 2014b", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1589, "text": "(Thornbrough et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 1722, "end": 1742, "text": "(Rabouw et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 1990, "end": 2019, "text": "Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2020, "end": 2038, "text": "Huang et al. 2015a", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 2319, "end": 2342, "text": "(de Wilde et al. 2013b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2691, "end": 2708, "text": "(Siu et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF168"}, {"start": 2709, "end": 2725, "text": "Lui et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 2855, "end": 2876, "text": "(Frieman et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2877, "end": 2906, "text": "Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2907, "end": 2922, "text": "Lu et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 3061, "end": 3076, "text": "(Ye et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF224"}, {"start": 3201, "end": 3219, "text": "(Dosch et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 3444, "end": 3470, "text": "(Nieto-Torres et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Host Innate Immune Responses Against Coronaviruses, and Viral Countermeasures"}, {"text": "The cell cycle is a series of highly regulated events that leads to cell division.

Cell cycle progression requires activation of different CDKs by, e.g., cyclin regulatory subunits.

This is beneficial to virus replication since factors that are normally needed for DNA replication and are upregulated in the S phase, can now be recruited to the cytoplasm by the virus. For example, DDX1, a cellular RNA helicase of the DExD/H family, interacts with coronavirus nsp14 (Xu et al. 2010) and was reported to be hijacked by coronaviruses to enhance their replication.

For example, TGEV N protein activates p53 which leads to accumulation of cell cycle-related kinases, like cdc-2 and cyclin B1. Synchronisation of cells in the S or G2/M phase favors TGEV RNA and virus production (Ding et al. 2013 (Ding et al. , 2014 and IBV replication (Dove et al. 2006) . For MHV nsp1 a similar mechanism has been proposed: nsp1 activates p53, leading to increased p21 and decreased CDK2-cyclin E levels. This ultimately leads to hyperphosphorylation of pRb and G1 cell cycle arrest ). In contrast, SARS-CoV infection leads to reduction of p53 expression levels. To counteract the inhibitory effect of p53, its expression is reduced by a mechanism that involves stabilization of the E3 ligase RCHY1 by SARS-CoV nsp3. RCHY1 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of p53. However, the exact role of this mechanism in cell cycle regulation, viral replication and/or pathogenesis remains unclear (Ma-Lauer et al. 2016) . Nevertheless, in cells that lack p53 expression, SARS-CoV replication was significantly enhanced (Ma-Lauer et al. 2016 ). Degradation of p53 by the SARS-CoV or HCoV-NL63 PL2 pro is another mechanism to counteract the antiviral effect of p53. The deubiquitinating activity of PL2 pro promotes the degradation of p53, thereby lowering the p53-mediated antiviral immune response (Yuan et al. 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 312, "end": 329, "text": "(Ding et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 330, "end": 349, "text": "(Ding et al. , 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 370, "end": 388, "text": "(Dove et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1038, "text": "(Ma-Lauer et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1159, "text": "(Ma-Lauer et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1417, "end": 1435, "text": "(Yuan et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF228"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Coronavirus-Induced Deregulation of the Cell Cycle"}, {"text": "In conclusion, coronaviruses appear to favor a specific stage in the cell cycle for their replication.

However, most studies on the presumed role of Cyps in coronavirus replication have focused on CypA. Initially, CypA was identified as an interaction partner of the SARS-CoV N protein (Luo et al. 2004 ) and by mass spectrometry it was also detected in purified SARS-CoV virions (Neuman et al. 2008) . Yeast two-hybrid experiments identified multiple Cyps (CypA, CypB, CypH, and CypG) and related PPIases (FK506-binding protein 1A and 1B) as potential binding partners of SARS-CoV nsp1 ). In addition, in Caco-2 or Huh7 cells, shRNA-mediated knockdown of CypA expression to less than 3% of the normal levels was reported to near-completely block HCoV-NL63 replication and reduce HCoV-229E replication by >1 log (Carbajo-Lozoya et al. 2014; von Brunn et al. 2015) . Recently, by using PPIA or PPIB knockout rather than knockdown cells, it was shown that FCoV depends on both CypA and CypB expression (>95% reduction in FCoV-infected CypA or CypB-KO cells). PPIase-deficient mutants, expressed in cells that also contained endogenous CypA and CypB, marginally reduced FCoV infection (two-to fivefold reduction in FCoV RNA compared to cells that express wt CypA or wt CypB only) (Tanaka et al. 2016) . Furthermore, the work of von Brunn and colleagues suggested that HCoV-229E replication was reduced by various CypA single-nucleotide polymorphisms that affect the protein's stability and function (von Brunn et al. 2015) . Although these results suggested a role for CypA in coronavirus replication, the siRNA-mediated depletion of CypA and CypB did not affect the replication of SARS-CoV (de Wilde et al. 2011) , despite the fact that the same knockdown did affect the replication of the distantly related arterivirus EAV (de Wilde et al. 2013a ). The differences reported using either knockout or knockdown of CypA with different efficiencies (100%, >97%, and *75% for CypA knockout cells, and CypA shRNA-or siRNA-mediated knockdown, respectively) suggest that low CypA expression levels may suffice to support efficient coronavirus replication and that the (near-)complete depletion of CypA may be needed to inhibit virus replication.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 321, "end": 342, "text": "de Wilde et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 343, "end": 362, "text": "Tanaka et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF181"}, {"start": 363, "end": 390, "text": "Carbajo-Lozoya et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 391, "end": 412, "text": "de Wilde et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 609, "end": 630, "text": "(Favreau et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 631, "end": 648, "text": "Kim and Lee 2014)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 869, "end": 885, "text": "(Luo et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 963, "end": 983, "text": "(Neuman et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 1395, "end": 1423, "text": "(Carbajo-Lozoya et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1424, "end": 1446, "text": "von Brunn et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF201"}, {"start": 1860, "end": 1880, "text": "(Tanaka et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 2079, "end": 2102, "text": "(von Brunn et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF201"}, {"start": 2262, "end": 2293, "text": "SARS-CoV (de Wilde et al. 2011)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2405, "end": 2427, "text": "(de Wilde et al. 2013a", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Role of Cyclophilins in Coronavirus Replication"}, {"text": "The major role of Cyps in cellular signaling is in the NF-AT signaling pathway.

The authors suggested the latter interaction to contribute to the SARS-CoV-induced cytopathic effect, but the interaction and its relevance for virus-induced cell death still awaits confirmation in the context of SARS-CoV-infected cells, as the rather artificial Y2H system is known to frequently yield false-positive hits. Indeed, another Y2H study with the SARS-CoV helicase (nsp13) demonstrated that out of the seven primary hits only one, DDX5, could be validated by independent methods as a true interactor of the helicase nsp13 (Chen et al. 2009 ). The functional significance of the interaction between nsp13 and the multifunctional cellular helicase DDX5, and whether the interaction is direct or mediated through RNA, remains to be determined. Using a similar Y2H screening approach, Xu and colleagues found that DDX1 bound to SARS-CoV and IBV nsp14, an interaction that enhanced IBV replication. The presence of one or more cellular helicases in the viral RTC supports their importance in virus replication. Indeed a later study reported that DDX1, regulated by the GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of the N protein, is involved in the regulation of sg mRNA synthesis (Wu et al. 2014) .

Among these, proteins involved in the metabolism of complex lipids and the early secretory pathway (COPI-coated vesicles) were found to play an important role. The antiviral effect of PKR was confirmed in this study and CDK6 was identified as a novel antiviral factor. A relatively large number of antiviral hits (90 of 778 factors; *12% of all factors tested) was identified for SARS-CoV compared to human kinome-directed screens performed with other viruses (Supekova et al. 2008; Lupberger et al. 2011; Moser et al. 2010) . This might indicate that, compared to other viruses, SARS-CoV replication is more extensively influenced by cellular factors. Multiple of these factors could be linked to cellular immune responses, like interleukin (IL) signaling, which (IL-6 and -8) was also implicated in controlling coronavirus infection and coronavirus-induced inflammation in other studies (Zhang et al. 2007; Baas et al. 2006) . Also several proteins from the p38 MAPK pathway were identified, which had also been implicated in coronavirus replication earlier and regulates IL-6-, IL-8-, and IL-10-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling (Chang et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2007; Song et al. 2013) . The interaction between coronaviruses and the innate immune response was already discussed in more detail in Chap. 6. A similar, genome-wide, siRNA screen identified host proteins important for the replication of IBV (Wong et al. 2015) , including 83 proviral proteins, 30 of which could be mapped to networks that interact with viral proteins. Many of the identified proteins are involved in RNA binding/processing, membrane trafficking and ubiquitin conjugation. The importance of the secretory pathway that was demonstrated by de Wilde et al. (2015) was in line with an earlier study that demonstrated that MHV replication was sensitive to Brefeldin A treatment and dependent on GBF1-mediated ARF1 activation, which appear to be involved in RTC formation (Verheije et al. 2008) . Similar results were also obtained for IBV (Wong et al. 2015) and this study also identified an early role in IBV infection for the valosin-containing protein (VCP) which may be involved in the maturation of virus-loaded endosomes. VCP is also important for the early stages of HCoV-229E replication (Wong et al. 2015 ). An RNAi screen of the druggable genome identified several endocytosis-related proteins that are required for efficient infection of HeLa cells with MHV (Burkard et al. 2014 ). Subsequent validation and mechanistic studies, demonstrated that-as discussed aboveclathrin-mediated endocytosis and trafficking to lysosomes are crucial for MHV fusion and entry, which required the activity of lysosomal proteases. This is different for MERS-CoV, which contains a furin cleavage site upstream of the fusion peptide in the Spike protein, and therefore requires furin activity, but not lysosomal proteases (Burkard et al. 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 370, "end": 392, "text": "(de Wilde et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 855, "end": 877, "text": "(Supekova et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 878, "end": 900, "text": "Lupberger et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 901, "end": 919, "text": "Moser et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 1284, "end": 1303, "text": "(Zhang et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF233"}, {"start": 1304, "end": 1321, "text": "Baas et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1538, "end": 1557, "text": "(Chang et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1576, "text": "Zhang et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF233"}, {"start": 1577, "end": 1594, "text": "Song et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1832, "text": "(Wong et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF212"}, {"start": 2130, "end": 2149, "text": "Wilde et al.

Insufficient knockdown of host factors can lead to false-negative results. Therefore, hits from siRNA screens need to be thoroughly validated, preferably using an independent technical approach. They should be considered as a mere starting point for further analysis rather than providing a definitive list of host factors involved in virus replication.
