Influenza is classified into three distinct subtypes based on antigenic differences: influenza A, influenza B and influenza C. Influenza A infects a range of species (humans, swine, equine, avian, marine mammals) and is responsible for large pandemics, whereas influenza B and C are generally restricted to human species. Viral nomenclature has been standardized and consists of influenza type, place of initial isolation, strain and year of isolation (e.g. A/HK/156/97) (1, 3) .",

This may be secondary to activation of immunological mechanisms, including the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8 (2) . Some studies of kidney and liver recipients have reported a high incidence of acute rejection following infection with influenza (4, 5) . However, while associations between influenza infection and rejection have been reported, a causal relationship has yet to be established. The most suggestive data is in lung transplant recipients, in whom community-acquired respiratory viruses have been implicated as triggers for acute rejection and for the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) (7) . In a prospective study of 50 lung transplant patients with community-acquired respiratory virus infections, a higher incidence of acute rejection and BOS was observed when compared with controls without such infections (8) . The overall rate of progression to viral pneumonia in these patients was 8%, but was predominantly observed in patients with influenza and para-influenza but not in those with coronavirus or rhinovirus infections.",

Minor variability is referred to as antigenic drift; viruses produced by antigenic drift may have substitutions in the antibodybinding site and may cause re-infection and epidemics. Larger changes may occur by reassortment of the segmented genome when two influenza viruses simultaneously infect a host cell, producing a virus with new subtypes of surface proteins (9, 10) . This 'antigenic shift' is responsible for pandemic influenza in a na\u00efve population. Pandemic influenza may also arise due to a direct mutation of an avian virus into one capable of efficient human-tohuman transmission, as described in Figure 1 and below (9, 10) .",

            "text": "In the past century, three pandemics of human influenza occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968 ( Figure 2 ) (11) . Of these, the 1918 pandemic resulted in the greatest loss of life, estimated at 40 million worldwide. Influenza virus from the last two pandemics emerged as a consequence of reassortment events between two viruses (9) (10) (11) . In the 1957 pandemic, a reassortment event involving an avian H2N2 and human H1N1 viral co-infection resulted in a transmissible pathogenic new human influenza virus that contained the avian HA and NA genes, and one of the avian polymerase genes. The 1968 pandemic influenza virus appears to have originated from a similar reassortment event that resulted in a transmissible H3N2 virus. Recent data show, however, that the highly virulent 1918 pandemic influenza virus ('Spanish flu virus') did not arise from similar mechanisms. Taubenberger et al. (12) recovered RNA fragments from paraffin block and frozen tissue of patients who died in the 1918 pandemic. By assembling and characterizing the se-quences of the eight gene segments from this virus, they have shown that the 1918 highly virulent pandemic virus was an H1N1 virus, in which all eight genes appear to be of avian origin. This data suggests that the 1918 virus resulted from cross-species infection from an avian species to humans, with subsequent adaptation of this avian virus to allow for efficient human-to-human spread. Remarkably, only a 10-amino acid difference was found between the polymerase proteins and the avian influenza consensus sequence. Tumpey et al. (13) used reverse genetics to reconstruct the virus and demonstrated that the 1918 virus is 100 times as lethal in mice as any other human influenza virus.",

All 15 HA and 9 NA subtypes are maintained in the aquatic bird population, where viral replication occurs in the gastrointestinal tract and virus is shed in feces at high titers (11, 14) . Although a number of avian influenza viruses have been responsible for occasional human disease, the current outbreak of H5N1 is most concerning in terms of its pandemic potential (15) . H5N1 was first recognized as a cause of human disease in Hong Kong in 1997, in connection with a poultry outbreak in live-bird markets (16) . A total of 18 human cases occurred with a 33% mortality. After a quiet period, the virus reemerged in 2003 (17) . Since then, the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus has caused unprecedented outbreaks in poultry stocks throughout Asia (18) . These outbreaks are in fact the largest and most severe outbreaks in domestic poultry in recorded history. In addition, the detection of virus in migratory birds (19) , and the recent spread of the virus to Europe suggest that migratory birds are directly spreading highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. The outbreak of avian influenza (H5N1) through South East Asia and its progressive spread westward have resulted in increasing concern about the threat of a new worldwide influenza pandemic (15) . In fact, the WHO has warned that we are now closer to a global pandemic than at any other time since the 1968 pandemic ( Figure 2 ). As of March 6, 2006, the total number of human cases confirmed by the WHO was 175, occurring in South East Asia, Turkey and Iraq. Human cases have been primarily due to bird-to-human transmission with only limited nonsustained human-to-human transmission (17, 20) . The disease in humans seems to have an unusually aggressive clinical course with rapid deterioration, primary viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure (17, 21, 22) . Case fatality has been high (95/175 patients or approximately 54%), often despite the initiation of early therapy. Most cases have occurred in previously healthy children and young adults (17) . It has been suggested that an exuberant host proinflammatory response may contribute to excessive tissue injury (23) . Recent population-based analyses in rural Vietnam have suggested that milder forms of avian influenza may be common, although this needs to be confirmed with seroprevalence studies (24) .",

Second, more opportunities for exposure may occur, given that transplant recipients are in close contact with the health care system. Third, it is likely that more severe disease with a higher mortality rate may be seen in transplant patients. Finally, it is possible that transplant recipients with pandemic influenza, or other contagious respiratory virus, may shed large amounts of virus for prolonged periods of time, resulting in spread to a greater number of contacts, i.e. the so-called 'super-spreaders' (27) . As an example, data in which quantitative severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus was measured in post-mortem tissue samples demonstrated very high tissue viral loads from a transplant patient when compared with samples taken from a cohort of non-transplant patients (27) . Studies evaluating shedding of influenza virus from throat or nasopharyngeal samples also suggest prolonged shedding in transplant recipients. In immunocompetent adults, the majority of patients no longer shed virus by day 5 of the illness (28) . In contrast, in a study of allogeneic HSCT recipients with influenza, the mean duration of viral shedding was 7 days (range 2-37 days); and among 44 patients who received no therapy, the mean duration of shedding was 11.3 days (29) .",

For example, during the SARS outbreak in Toronto, closure of the transplant program occurred due to several concerns (30) . Transmission of SARS within health care facilities resulted in concerns about recipient (or living donor) safety as a result of admission to the hospital. Finally, with any new disease outbreak, concerns about transmission of infection from donor to recipients are present. Recent cases of West Nile virus and rabies transmission highlight such concerns, but transmission is theoretically possible in the setting of a disease outbreak of avian influenza. While lung transplantation would logically be the most likely setting in which such transmission would occur, virus may be present in other organs. For avian influenza, case reports of extrapulmonary manifestations have included encephalitis and gastrointestinal symptoms (31) . Experimental infection of cats with H5N1 demonstrated viral replication in multiple extra-respiratory tissues (32) .",

Pandemics can cause large surges in the numbers of people requiring or seeking medical or hospital treatment, temporarily overwhelming health services. The CDC predicts that a 'medium-level epidemic' could kill up to 207 000 Americans, hospitalize 734 000, and sicken about a third of the U.S. population. This will lead to issues of resource allocation, especially given the limited number of ventilator ICU beds available at any given time. It is estimated that during an outbreak of pandemic influenza, ventilator capacity would be quickly outstripped very early in the course of the pandemic. High rates of worker absenteeism can also interrupt other essential services, such as healthcare delivery, law enforcement, transportation and communications. During past pandemics, attack rates reached 25-35% of the total population. The 1918 pandemic killed at least 40 million people. In the United States, the mortality rate during that pandemic was around 2.5%. Overall, it would be unlikely that a transplant program could remain active even in a limited capacity during the midst of an influenza pandemic. This would mean that in addition to those dying directly due to influenza, loss of life would occur in potential organ recipients who are unable to receive life-saving transplant procedures.",

            "text": "Vaccination A yearly trivalent inactivated vaccine based on circulating influenza strains has been recommended for all transplant recipients (33) . The vaccine is produced from virus grown in embryonated hens' eggs, and contains 15 lg each of two circulating strains of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and 15 lg of an influenza B strain. Vaccines elicit a strain-specific response and have reduced efficacy against viruses that have undergone antigenic drift and are ineffective against those that have undergone antigenic shift. Increases in antibody titer are seen in approximately 90% of healthy adults who receive vaccine (1) . However, the immunogenicity of this vaccine in patients on exogenous immunosuppression is questionable. Although somewhat conflicting, data from several studies show that neutralizing antibody response is suboptimal and ranges from 15-86% (34) (35) (36) (37) . Indeed, influenza may occur despite vaccination in organ transplant recipients (23) . One study showed that two doses of influenza vaccine increased immunogenicity from 68% to greater than 80%, although this data was uncontrolled (38) . A live attenuated vaccine has been shown to have similar immunogenicity as the inactivated vaccine in young immunocompetent adults (39) . This has not been evaluated in transplant recipients primarily, since live vaccines have generally been contraindicated in transplant recipients due to their ability to cause severe disease. There is also no convincing data to suggest that vaccination plays a role in organ dysfunction or is a trigger for rejection (36, 40) .",

Highly pathogenic viruses (H5 and H7) are lethal to chicken embryos and cannot be grown in sufficient quantity (41) . Mammalian cell lines have been used to culture influenza for vaccines, but due to their high pathogenicity, work with these virus subtypes requires a high level of biocontainment and safety (41) . Various strategies to overcome these limitations are being assessed, such as the use of baculovirus-expressed HA, or using reverse genetic systems to generate reassortant strains (41, 42) . However, conventional surface antigen vaccine candidates have been found to be poorly immunogenic in clinical studies, and use of whole virus or adjuvants may be necessary (41) . It has been estimated that after the onset of an avian influenza pandemic, an immunogenic vaccine for wide-scale use may not be available for several months.",

These drugs may be used either for chemoprophylaxis or for treatment of influenza infections. M2 inhibitors include amantadine and rimantadine. However, the effectiveness of these drugs is limited due to emerging resistance. The H5N1 strains from South East Asia have mutations in the M2 gene that confer drug-resistance (43) . The NA inhibitors, zanamivir (inhaled) and oseltamivir (oral) have similar efficacy for prevention of influenza A, including strains that are resistant to amantadine. These drugs work via specific and potent inhibition of influenza NA enzyme activity, which is responsible for cleavage of sialic acid residues and release of viral progeny from infected cells (44) . These drugs appear to be safe in transplant recipients and do not appear to interact with commonly used immunosuppressive medications. Retrospective data in transplant populations (primarily HSCT patients) have shown that these drugs are likely effective in reducing progression to viral pneumonia, reducing viral shedding and reducing mortality (although emergence of resistance during therapy has been reported) (2, 4, 45) .",

Many similarities exist between the current outbreak and the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic that resulted in over 40 million deaths worldwide. In the event of a pandemic, transplant patients will likely be uniquely predisposed to serious infection with high mortality. They may shed higher quantities of virus for longer durations, leading to greater contagious potential. Vaccination and antiviral strategies are also likely to be less effective in this population. Finally, it is likely that transplant programs would be unable to continue to remain active in the setting of an influenza pandemic, leading to further mortality for those on transplant waiting lists.",
