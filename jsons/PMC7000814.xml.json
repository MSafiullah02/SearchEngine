Among other factors, manufacturing must change to support growth. Capital-rich investment in fixed facilities that commit to a given form of production for a given target poses significant costs and challenges to vaccine manufacturers if there is a major change in strategy. Long lead times in manufacturing, and potentially hundreds of complex process steps, all complicate capabilities. Vaccine companies, like the biotech industry, desire novel production methods out of a need for efficiency that reduce the cost of goods, shorten time to licensure, and respond quicker to disease outbreaks. mRNA-based vaccines hold the promise to revolutionize the field by addressing current manufacturing challenges and offering novel vaccine compositions.",

Within weeks, clinical batches can be generated after the availability of a sequence encoding the immunogen. The process is cell-free and scalable. Of paramount advantage, a facility dedicated to mRNA production should be able to rapidly manufacture vaccines against multiple targets, with minimal adaptation to processes and formulation. In addition, new targets requiring multi-antigen approaches will benefit from the speed in which mRNA can render multiple constructs.",

Two categories of mRNA constructs are being actively evaluated: non-replicating mRNA (NRM) and self-amplifying mRNA (SAM) constructs (Fig. 1). Both have in common a cap structure, 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs), an open-reading frame (ORF), and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail.3 SAM differs with the inclusion of genetic replication machinery derived from positive-stranded mRNA viruses, most commonly from alphaviruses such as Sindbis and Semliki-Forest viruses.4,5 Generally, the ORF encoding viral structural proteins is replaced by the selected transcript of interest, and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is retained to direct cytoplasmic amplification of the replicon construct. The potential merits of NRM versus SAM will be addressed later.",

First, the purity of the mRNA is a crucial determinant of yields, and it is known that the DNA-dependent RNA polymerases yield smaller oligoribonucleotide impurities as a result of abortive initiation events,11 as well as double-stranded (ds) RNA generated by self-complementary 3\u2032 extension,12 which can result in type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine production through pattern recognition receptors.

For example, optimization of guanine and cytosine (GC) content can have a significant impact,23 and has been well established with DNA vaccines. The innate immune activation to mRNA can also influence its utility as a delivery system. The use of modified nucleosides, such as pseudouridine or N-1-methylpseudouridine to remove intracellular signaling triggers for protein kinase R (PKR) activation, resulted in enhanced antigen expression and adaptive immune responses.24\u201326 It has been demonstrated that successful protein production, minimal undesired inflammatory responses, and systemic adaptive immune responses could be achieved preclinically by using unmodified mRNA27 through a combination of optimizing the coding sequence and removal of any unwanted inflammatory impurities.28,29 Ultimately, comparative immunogenicity between these approaches require studies that control all potential factors, including the delivery system. Human studies \u201chead-to-head\u201d comparing modified and unmodified nucleoside mRNA constructs would confirm clinically relevant differences, if any. Similarly, controlled comparisons of the aforementioned NRM and SAM are needed to determine any distinctions.

Thus, early-phase clinical trials need to be designed in a way to appropriately capture the inflammatory component intrinsic to all mRNA vaccines, given that several intracellular innate immune response sensors are activated by RNA.65 Elements include measuring administration site reactions such as pain, tenderness-associated systemic reactions such as fever and malaise, and routine biochemical laboratory parameters (e.g., serum electrolytes, liver function test, and CBC). These parameters, when followed closely, can be designed to develop enrollment pause rules in the event that severe tolerability issues are observed in a clinical trial.66 Detailed characterization of the immune response fully leveraging modern techniques such as transcriptomics and systems biology, in addition to traditional methods of immune monitoring, needs to be implemented. Several agency guidelines developed for the study of novel adjuvants in human subjects provide sufficient guidance that can be applied to mRNA candidate vaccines on how to monitor safety in early-phase clinical studies.67",

As with novel adjuvants, an adequate safety database to assure safety for candidate mRNA vaccines is likely to be in the tens of thousands range. Given that different manufacturers are pursuing different strategies to optimize their candidate vaccines, conclusions from one candidate may not be generalizable. Therefore, it is likely that each candidate vaccine will have to independently prove its risk/benefit profile that is favorable.",

(4) Cytosol-located NRM constructs are immediately translated by ribosomes to produce the protein of interest, which undergoes subsequent post-translational modification.
