O*NET is a job characterization tool, generated from survey data, with rich information on tasks performed, skills needed, and job characteristics for different occupations, in order to inform job seekers or researchers [10]. As nearly 600 six-digit SOC occupations are updated each year, the entire O*NET database is completely refreshed every few years [11]. Between 2001 and 2011, nearly 160,000 employees from 125,000 workplaces had responded to O*NET questionnaires. O*NET uses a deliberate survey sampling scheme, to ensure representation of workers from across the United States, across organizations of different size, and from both government and private workers. For small SOCs where it may be hard to find respondents, and to complement data from job incumbents, O-NET also relies on occupational analysts and occupational experts to answer questionnaires. O*NET does not collect data from military occupations; thus, SOC codes beginning with 55 \u201cMilitary Specific Occupations\u201d are not included in O*NET data. Similarly, employment numbers for \u201cMilitary Specific Occupations\u201d is not reported in the BLS Occupational Employment Statistics Database. No other SOC codes are excluded from the O*NET database, but two SOC codes were not included in the measure utilized for this analysis, which were for the occupations of \u201cRock Splitters, Quarry\u201d and \u201cTiming Device Assemblers and Adjusters\u201d employing 4,870 and 780 persons in the United States, respectively [12].",

Within O*NET, these data are converted to a 0\u2013100 score, representing weighted-average frequency of the metric for each SOC code. For this analysis, occupations were retained that had a score of 50\u2013100, representing exposure to disease/infection more than once a month.

This analysis estimates that the number of workers who face frequent exposure to an infection or disease at work; estimates of the number of workers who fall ill due to such exposures are not possible in this analysis. However, a primary goal of public health, especially in the face of a global pandemic, is to prevent the spread of disease. Therefore, understanding how many workers are frequently exposed, and what occupations they represent, is an important first step in being able to prompt and enact risk reduction strategies prior to disease transmission occurring, and illness manifesting.

Exposure to disease or infection in the workplace, and resultant transmission into the community, is dependent on many factors which were not able to be investigated in this analysis. This includes number of contacts that worker has with the public, workplace emphasis on and access to handwashing, number of interactions with bodily fluids, existing hygiene and cleaning practices in the workplace, availability of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) etc. While certainly this could vary between occupations, many of these factors would also vary within occupations, and none of these data were captured with the O*NET data. Presenteeism, reporting to work despite being symptomatic for disease, is common in the workplace, and is another contributor to the transmission of infectious disease, and potentially to the spread of epidemics or pandemics [2,18]. One analysis examined the role of workplace transmission in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, estimating that about 8 million employees in the United States worked while infected, and that these workers may have caused the infection of as many as 7 million of their co-workers [19].",

Workers without access to paid leave have higher rates of presenteeism, and are less likely to receive preventative health services such as getting flu shots [22]. Occupational sector also influences rates of presenteeism, with studies from various countries showing higher rates of presenteeism among workers in healthcare, public service, and educational sectors, as these essential services often do not have substitute workers available [23\u201325]. Indeed, a recent systematic review identified occupation type as one of the strongest predictors of presenteeism [2]. As many of these sectors are already exposed to disease due to work activities, it is important that disease response plans for these sectors include not only control methods to reduce exposures at work, but also contingency plans to ensure sick workers do not come back to work with disease. This could be accomplished through cross-training, providing extra paid sick leave during this time, ensuring flexible working conditions, and ensuring substitute workers are identified to fill in if essential workers fall ill.",

O*NET data were generated from self-reported subjective questionnaires and therefore are subject to bias and misclassification. Respondents may not realize they are exposed to infection or disease at work unless they are in a workplace where these hazards are communicated to them and protective equipment is provided (e.g., healthcare sectors) leading to potential differential misclassification across occupational groups. Workers could also be reporting expose to disease or infection that occurs while commuting to work (particularly by public transportation), leading to additional misclassification. Additionally, information from the O*NET database is applied at the occupation-level, and therefore does not account for within-job exposure variation [26]. Many workers are not included in the O*NET and BLS data sources, including independent contractors (which includes \u201cgig economy\u201d workers), domestic workers, self-employed, undocumented, and continent workers. These workers may be uniquely susceptible to exposure at work due to limited ability to take time off if they or a family member is ill [27]. In Sweden and Norway, higher rates of presenteeism (coming to work when sick) were found among low-income and immigrant workers [28]. This further emphasizes the importance of continuing to develop occupational surveillance systems that capture exposures and outcomes experienced by these undercounted groups, as well as ensure worker protections extend to protect these undercounted workers.",

These are workers that public health should consider especially at risk for COVID-19, due to frequent exposure to disease and infectious agents. However, it should be noted that there are many other workers that could also be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, or encourage the spread of COVID-19, such as workers who are not given access to flexible working, workers who do not feel they can take sick time if they or a family member is sick, workers who do not have access to paid sick leave, or workers that perform essential services and do not have access to substitute workers. Work presented here underscores the importance of all workplaces developing sector-specific response plans to keep employees safe, halt the transmission of disease in the workplace, and ensure sick workers do not have to come to work. It also serves as a reminder that the workplace is an important locus for public health interventions, as many workers are frequently exposed to disease and infection at work, and their exposures can Increase disease incidence both in worker and community groups.",
