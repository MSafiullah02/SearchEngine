Since, its appearance in the city of Wuhan (Hebei district) in China, it has been a relentless march of new cases and deaths [1]. What makes it more scary is the novel strain of the virus and the unknowns associated with it [2]. The present strategy has been to prevent its spread by social isolation and a scientific overdrive to manufacture newer rapid diagnostic kits as well as medications [[3], [4], [5]]. Coronavirus belongs to a family of RNA viruses within the virus family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales [6]. Coronaviruses are divided into three groups depending on the antigenic spikes produced by different protein structures of the virus (spike, membrane & nucleocapsid) [7]. The SARS coronavirus falls under group 2.",

            "text": "The ability of this family of viruses to readily undergo genetic recombination not only within same group, but also between group, makes them readily susceptible to natural selection and changing its nature of virulence [8]. The most striking feature however, is its ability to freely cross from one species to another. HCoV 229 E belongs to the group 1 of the coronaviruses family thought to be responsible for the epidemic of common cold [7]. Transmission from bats to humans is thought to be the initial transmission process for HCoV 229 E, which had happened within the last two centuries. However, the two dramatic events- SARS-CoV (originated from bats and got transmitted from civet cats) & MERS-CoV (originated from bats and got transmitted from camels) in 2003 and 2012 respectively brough our focus back on the coronavirus family [8,9]. The present coronavirus pandemic is the result of changes in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein component via natural selection (?in human host/?in animal vector) resulting in its increased affinity for the ACE2 receptor site [10]. ]At present we have more than 450000 individuals affected with Cov-2 resulting in more than 12000 deaths worldwide [11]. In India, as the present day statistics holds, we have around 718 confirmed cases with 13 deaths [12]. Several countries including India have gone into a state of lockdown in order to prevent spread of this deadly virus. With new rapid-diagnostic kits coming in and trials with potentially helpful drugs underway, we need a better understanding of the disease process and what it holds for the near future. With all the CoV-2 related data available through reliable sources, we choose to assimilate the available data on total infection rates, total deaths, case fatality rates (CFR), recovery numbers from across the globe and create a predictive analysis on what we can expect in India in the coming weeks.",

A separate correlation analysis was performed between week 5 and week 6 death counts and a very robust association (r = 0.97) was found justifying its inclusion as the input variable.\u2022Step 4: Using week 5 death count as input a simple linear regression was performed to create a model predicting the week 6 outcomes. The model was robust (r = 0.96, R2 = 0.94, adjusted R2 = 0.94) and statistically significant (P-value <0.001, 95% CI: 1.13\u20131.54).\u2022Step 5: From the regression model formula the minimum, maximum, and average death count was estimated (Table 6).
