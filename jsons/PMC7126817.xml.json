However, one major part of milk \u2013 whey, has traditionally not been paid as much attention as happened with source milk, probably because it is a by-product of cheese making, viewed for a long time as of little value (besides additive to animal feed). Interestingly, Hippocrates already applauded the health properties of whey in Ancient Greece; and during the Middle Age, whey was considered not only as a medicine, but also even as an aphrodisiac and a skin balm: it was in fact a regular component of salves and potions to soothe burns, to inspire vitality and to cure various illnesses (Kosikowski, 1982). Recent decades have witnessed an increased interest in whey protein products, owing to their nutritional role, and more and more to their active role upon human health. A multitude of bibliographic material covering that topic has accordingly been published; this review will focus on the most recent research advances pertaining to the biological properties of whey proteins.",

Caseins account for 80% (w/w) of the whole protein inventory, and can easily be recovered from skim milk via isoelectric precipitation (by addition of, or in situ production of acid) or rennet-driven coagulation \u2013 both of which release whey as by-product (Fig. 1\n). Whey proteins are globular molecules with a substantial content of \u03b1-helix motifs, in which the acidic/basic and hydrophobic/hydrophilic amino acids are distributed in a fairly balanced way along their polypeptide chains (Evans, 1982). The whey protein profile, including general chemical and physiochemical properties, is depicted in Table 1\n. Whey proteins include \u03b2-lactoglobulin (\u03b2-LG, for short), \u03b1-lactalbumin (\u03b1-LA), immunoglobulins (IG), bovine serum albumin (BSA), bovine lactoferrin (BLF) and lactoperoxidase (LP), together with other minor components. Their main biological activities are summarized in Table 2\n.",

The amino acids cysteine, glutamate and glycine are part of the primary structure of this peptide; cysteine incorporation is the rate-limiting step for its synthesis; and both cysteine and glutamine are major players in the coordinated T-cell response of macrophages and lymphocytes. Recall that whey proteins are rich in cysteine and glutamate residues; this suggests that their ingestion may contribute to increase the level of free cysteine, and consequent production of GSH. WPC is indeed an effective cysteine donor for GSH replenishment, during immune deficiency states; note that GSH is important in immune regulation and cancer prevention in animals, in improvement of immune and liver functions, and in helping overcome GSH-deficiency in seropositive and Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients.",

Nevertheless, the action of this protein is not restricted to bacteria with iron requirements (e.g. coliforms), because apo-BLF was also shown to possess bactericidal power against a wide range of microorganisms (Dionysius, Grieve, & Milne, 1993). BLF can damage the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria via binding to Lipid A lipopolysaccharides (LPS) \u2013 which compose their asymmetric lipid bilayer membrane (Appelmelk et al., 1994); release thereof causes structural changes, which include loss of membrane potential and integrity.

            "text": "The antimicrobial effect of BLF can be taken advantage of in treatment of enteric infections (as depicted in Table 3\n). In vivo studies, encompassing animal models, have proven that BLF helps eliminate E. coli endotoxins, when bovine colostrum is administered into the gut under conditions of septic shock (Dohler & Nebermann, 2002). BLF may act synergistically with lysozyme or antibodies (Ellison & Giehl, 1991), immunoglobulins and LP, and can potentiate the activity of such antibiotics as novobiocin against Gram-negative bacteria (Sanchez & Watts, 1999). Alone or in combination with penicillin G, BLF enhances Staphylococcus aureus susceptibility to immune-defense mechanisms; this can be a beneficial trait in the treatment of infections caused thereby (Diarra et al., 2003). Another bacterium inhibited by that protein is Streptococcus mutans \u2013 the prime cause of dental caries; BLF inhibits aggregation of those saliva induced-bacteria to salivary components, or to salivary films (Mitoma et al., 2001, Oho et al., 2002). In addition, BLF has been demonstrated (Hoerr & Bostwick, 2000) to protect against such pathogens as Haemophilus influenzae, which causes otitis media (ear infections) in children. In vivo and in vitro tests carried out by Dial et al. (1998) confirmed that BLF possesses antimicrobial activity against H. pylori infections at pH 6, at concentrations above 0.5 mg/ml, and is able to clear H. felis infection in mouse; and that a non-iron-dependent component of such a protein displays antimicrobial activity. Thereof, use of bovine BLF as therapeutic agent to assist antimicrobial agents towards erradication of such harmful bacterium was suggested (Di M\u00e1rio et al., 2003). Recently, BLF was found to exibit antibacterial activity against Carnobacterium viridans, at neutral pH and refrigeration temperatures (al-Nabulsi & Holley, 2005).",

BLF interacts with viruses, but not with cells infected thereby; however, it can interact with the host cells before they are infected \u2013 like happens with hepatitis B virus (HBV) for which interaction with the cell surface proteins blocks viral adhesion to the cells themselves (Hara et al., 2002). This issue was confirmed with regard to E1 and E2 HVC envelope proteins in vitro (Yi, Kaneko, Yu, & Murakumi, 1997), and in the case of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (Ng et al., 2001). In what concerns hepatitis C and G viruses (HVC and HGV, respectively), BLF inhibits the viral entry into hepatocyte and lymphocyte cells \u2013 via neutralising the virion, and blocking the invasion of the cell thereby (Ikeda et al., 1998). In the case of HIV-1, succinylation of that protein slightly increases the extent of inhibition of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (Wang, Ye, & Ng, 2000). In vivo experiments involving HIV-infected individuals have indicated that BLF inhibits strongly that enzyme, but only slightly protease and integrase (Ng et al., 2001). Recently, LF was found to inhibit in vitro enterovirus 71 (EV 71), via binding to one of their four capsid proteins, VP1; furthermore, BLF can induce IFN-\u03b1 expression of neuronal (SK-N-SH) cells and inhibit EV 7-induced IL-6 production (Weng et al., 2005).",

Recently, Marchetti, Trybala, Superti, Johansson, and Bergstr\u00f6m (2004) elucidated the mechanism of BLF antiviral activity against HSV-1 infection initiates infection of cells via binding to it glycosaminoglycans (GAG) (WuDunn & Spear, 1989), which are composed of repeating (specifically sulphated) disaccharide units. BLF binds specifically to the two common classes, heparan sulfate (HS) and/or chondroitin sulfate (CS), on cell surfaces \u2013 hence occupying moieties that would function as initial receptors for said virus. This mechanism was promote (Drobni, N\u00e4slund, & Evander, 2004) to be similar to human papillomavirus inhibition. Bovine BLF was also shown (Ishii et al., 2003) to reduce serum HVC-RNA levels in patients suffering from chronic hepatitis C; a dominant environment of Th1-cytokine is produced in the peripheral blood that favours eradication of HVC via interferon (IFN) therapy.",

The iron-binding capacity of BLF has been put forward as the molecular rationale behind such a biological activity; free iron may act as a mutagenic promoter, by inducing oxidative damage to the nucleic acid structure; hence, when BLF binds iron in tissues, it reduces the risk of oxidant-induced carcinomas (Weinberg, 1996) and colon adenocarcinomas (Tsuda et al., 1998). Studies are available (Masuda et al., 2000; Tanaka et al., 2000) that pertain to such other cancers as lung, bladder, tongue and oesophagus, and which convey similar results.",

It can also be produced by specific generator systems, such as via oxidation of ascorbic acid, oxidation of glucose-oxidase, oxidation of hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidase, and manganese-dependent aerobic oxidation of reduced pyridine nucleotides by peroxidase (Wolason & Sumner, 1993). The H2O2 content is rapidly reduced by catalases and peroxidases that are adventitious in milk; hence, it is normally present to very small levels (Bjorck, Rosen, Marshall, & Reiter, 1975).
