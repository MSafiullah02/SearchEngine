            "text": "The aim of the present study was to determine the analysis of virulence genes and antimicrobial profile of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli isolated from diseased lambs. Two hundred ninety E. coli isolates were recovered from 300 rectal swabs of diarrheic lambs and were confirmed by biochemical tests. The pathotype determination was done according to the presence of genes including f5, f41, LTI, STI, bfp, ipaH, stx 1 , stx 2 , eae, ehlyA, cnf 1 , cnf 2 , cdIII, cdIV, and f17 by PCR method. Sixty-six isolates (23.72%) possessed the STI gene and categorized into entrotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Nine isolates (3.1%) and five isolates (1.72%) were positive for the cnf1 and cnf2 genes which categorized into necrotoxic E. coli (NTEC). Hundred and seventeen isolates (40.34%) harbored stx 1 and/or stx 2 and classified as Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). Thirteen isolates (4.48%) were assigned to atypical entropathogenic E. coli (aEPEC) and possessed eae gene. Two isolates (0.68%) were positive for ipaH gene and were assigned to entroinvasive E. coli (EIEC). Statistical analysis showed a specific association between eae gene and STEC pathotype (P < 0.0001). The most prevalent resistance was observed against lincomycin (96.5%) and the lowest resistance was against kanamycine (56.02%), respectively. The high prevalence of STEC and ETEC indicates that diarrheic lambs represent an important reservoir for humans. ETEC may play an important role for frequent occurrence of diarrhea in lambs observed in this region. Due to high antibiotic resistance, appropriate control should be implemented in veterinary medicine to curb the development of novel resistant isolates.",

            "text": "Lamb diarrhea is a multifactor disease that can cause economic loss and is one of the most common reported diseases in lambs up to 3 months old (Aiello and Moses 2016) . Since sheep are considered to be the lifeline agro-economy in many tropical regions around the world, identification, characterization, and treatment of the causal agents of this disease are of significant economic importance. An array of noninfectious and infectious agents has been identified as causal agents of diarrhea in lambs (Aiello and Moses 2016) . Noninfectious factors include insufficient uptake of colostrum, poor sanitation, stress, overcrowding in the lamb pens, and cold water (Aiello and Moses 2016) . Furthermore, various infection agents such as Coronaviruses, Rotaviruses, Cryptosporidium spp., Clostridium perfrigens, Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli, and Salmonlla spp. have also been linked to this disease. Among these pathogenic agents, E. coli is the most common and important once (Muktar et al. 2015) .",

            "text": "Pathogenic E. coli has been associated with two forms of enteric and septicemia infections, depending on the number of bacterium and the physiological condition of the affected hosts (Bihannic et al. 2014) . Moreover, enteric pathogenic E. coli isolates often possess diverse virulence factors and are classified into several major pathotypes based on their pathogenesis (Beutin and Fach 2014) . Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolates are the major cause of diarrhea in newborn farm animals (Cho and Yoon 2014) . Fimbrial antigens (F5, F41) and enterotoxins (LT-I, LT-II, ST-I, and ST-II) are the most prominent virulence factors of ETEC (Duan et al. 2012) . Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are frequently detected in small ruminants with or without diarrhea. STEC isolates carry genes encoding Shiga toxins and may possess other virulence genes for intimin and enterohemolysin. STEC strains, which also possess eaeA and ehly genes, are termed enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) (Askari Badouei et al. 2014) . Two particular groups of virulence determinants, CNF1 and CNF2 and CDTs, have received attention because of their potential impact on animal and human health. These virulence factors have been isolated from healthy and diarrheic or septicemic calves and categorized to NTEC pathotype (Borriello et al. 2012) .",

In this study, most of ETEC isolates from lambs were f41+ or f5+ and produce ST1.
