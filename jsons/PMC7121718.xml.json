He found higher numbers (by several orders of magnitude) by direct microscopic counting than by the plating procedure. In 1949, Winogradsky confirmed Razumov\u2019s assessment and noted that many microbes are not satisfied with laboratory cultivation conditions. He remarked that readily cultivated bacteria in natural microbial communities \u201cdraw importance to themselves, whereas the other forms, being less docile, or even resistant, escape attention\u201d (Relman, 1998).

She authored an entire textbook on novel approaches for in vitro cultivation of bacteria (Mattman, 2000). Over his 39-year career at Tulane University, Gerald Domingue published dozens of papers and book chapters devoted to the role of chronic forms of bacteria in inflammatory disease. \u201cIt is unwise to dismiss the pathogenic capacities of any microbe in a patient with a mysterious disease,\u201d he wrote. \u201cClearly, any patient with a history of recurrent infection and persistent disability is sending the signal that the phenomenon [infection with chronic bacteria or viruses] could be occurring. The so-called autoimmune diseases in which no organism can be identified by routine testing techniques are particularly suspect\u201d (Domingue and Woody, 1997).",

Other research teams using less rigorous techniques often failed to duplicate their findings. Many of their observations were dismissed on the premise that their samples could have been contaminated. However, the greatest impediment toward the acceptance of this work was a set of rules set in motion by the nineteenth-century German physician Robert Koch. These rules, known as \u201cKoch\u2019s postulates,\u201d stipulate that in order for a microbe to be deemed a causative agent of a disease, certain criteria must be met. The same microbe must be identified in every person with a given disease; the specific microbe must be able to be grown on pure culture medium in the lab; and, when reintroduced into a healthy animal or person, must produce the disease again.",

Unable to grow all but a fraction of bacteria found in the human body in the confines of a Petri dish, and constrained by a lack of technology with which to detect new microbes, the theory of autoimmune disease, in which the immune system loses tolerance and generates antibodies that target self gained momentum in the 1960s.",

However, nearly all speakers discussed the role of viruses in autoimmune disease, whereas only a few contemplated bacteria. Autoimmune conditions were repeatedly attributed to easily cultured viruses such as Epstein\u2013Barr and Herpes 6. Where bacteria were discussed, most reports centered on select pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae. Yet because none of these pathogens has ever been detected in any one autoimmune disease state 100% of the time, such researchers continue to paint autoimmune diseases as a mosaic \u2013 in which the hallmarks of infection are continually present in bits and pieces but cannot be drawn into a fully cohesive picture. Yet the emerging science of metagenomics is beginning to unmask entirely new populations of microbes whose genomes allow for a means by which to bridge these gaps.

Rather than focusing on the study of single microbes and their genomes, metagenomics provides a means of analyzing aspects of microbial communities through their underpinning genetics.

Some of these microbes, such as Bacteriodes, were found to penetrate the epithelial layer, at times intracellularly (Swidsinski et al., 2002).

Some of the same bacteria identified in the salivary microbiome, such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis \u2013 both of which cause tooth decay (Lamell et al., 2000) \u2013 have also been identified in atherosclerotic plaque (Kozarov et al., 2005). Bacterial DNA has been detected in the blood (Nikkari et al., 2001). Recently, 18 different bacterial taxa were detected in the amniotic fluid, which was previously believed to be completely sterile (DiGiulio et al., 2008). Analysis using 16S rRNA sequencing detected 28 distinct phylotypes on biofilm removed from prosthetic hip joints during revision arthroplasties \u2013 joints also removed from a body compartment also thought to be sterile. The prevalence of hydrothermal vent eubacteria, which were previously thought to persist only in the depths of the ocean since they were found at temperatures well above 176\u00b0F (80\u00b0C), was higher than the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus, a common biofilm species (Fig. 12.1).\n\n",

The dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) antagonist trimethoprim is such an effective antibiotic because, like humans, bacterial species possess a folate metabolism. Bacteria in the distal intestinal tract of mice have been shown to significantly alter the composition of human blood metabolites, including amino acids, indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), and organic acids containing phenol groups, providing another example of the significant interplay between bacterial and human metabolism.

The goal of the project is simply to examine associations between bacterial genes and human phenotypes. \u201cWe don\u2019t care if the name of the bacteria is Enterobacter or Salmonella. We want to know if there is an enzyme producing carbohydrates, an enzyme producing gas or an enzyme degrading proteins,\u201d explains Francisco Guarner of the project.",

Metabolomic approaches can be used to characterize entire components of the microbiome that cannot easily be seen or studied directly. Because the downstream results of gene expression manifest in the human metabolome, the metabolome can be analyzed for the presence of those unique metabolites created under the influence of the microbiota. Dumas et al. used mass spectroscopy to identify the nonhuman metabolites present in the urine of subjects living in three distinct populations \u2013 the United States, China, and Japan (Dumas et al., 2006). He found that subjects in each population produced very different nonhuman metabolites. Thus, genetic makeup, healthcare, nutrition, and external toxins, factors associated with the acquisition of a particular microbiota, caused the three populations to become significantly different. Moreover, when five of the Japanese subjects moved to the United States, their metabolomes changed to resemble those of the American population. This suggests that the metagenome is indeed the product of its environment, and that the composition of the microbiota is far more important than regional variations in the human genome itself.",

While just a few decades ago, most of the bacteria in Homo sapiens were assumed to persist on their own in a planktonic form, it is now understood that large components of the microbiota persist in communities commonly called biofilms; they are sheltered by a self-created polymeric matrix that better protects them from the immune response. Hundreds of different microbes can persist in a single biofilm community, and individual bacteria often form a niche inside the biofilm that allows them to promote their own survival and the chronic nature of the infection. For example, more virulent bacteria may protect the biofilm from outside intrusion whereas other less innocuous species inside the biofilm may focus on obtaining nutrients for the community. As the biofilm forms and then develops, the collective genetic expression of microbes in the biofilm is altered dramatically. For example, the expression of 800 genes has been shown to be altered when a single bacterial species joins a biofilm (Sauer et al., 2002). Biofilms are increasingly being detected in autoimmune diseases where they were not known to previously exist. For example, Wolcott recently used pyrosequencing to demonstrate that the infectious agents that drive the development of diabetic leg, foot, and pressure ulcers are almost all in a biofilm state (Dowd et al., 2008).",

Blaney et al. found that of 100 patients with various autoimmune diagnoses, 85% had 1,25-D above the normal range (Fig. 12.3) (Blaney et al., 2009). Yoshizawa et al. reported that in VDR knockout mice, a circumstance that closely mimics extreme VDR dysregulation, 1,25-D levels increase by a factor of 10 (Yoshizawa et al., 1997). However, understanding 1,25-D\u2019s role in various inflammatory disease states is complicated by the fact that most researchers determining vitamin D status test subjects only for levels of the inactive vitamin D metabolite, 25-D.\n\n",

However, if the spectrum of autoimmune disease were driven by a common factor \u2013 namely a person\u2019s microbial inhabitants \u2013 variability in disease could be explained by accounting for how the human microbiota accumulates and develops in any one person. Enck et al. recently analyzed fecal flora of stool samples from 35,292 adults whose ages ranged from 18 to 96 years of age in order to gauge the relative abundance and composition of various bacterial species over time (Enck et al., 2009). He found that while the number of bacteria in the fecal microbiota remained stable with age, the composition of the microbiota diversified as subjects became older, with the oldest subjects measured (over 60 years of age) representing the most profound changes. Older subjects were much more likely to have higher prevalence of microbes associated with chronic disease such as Enterococcus and E. coli.",

This process is known as successive infection and offers us a framework for understanding how not only diseases of the gastrointestinal tract develop, but also any number of other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. As human genes are upregulated or downregulated by components of the microbiota, the body shifts farther and farther away from its natural state of homeostasis.

It seems likely the same could be said for any autoimmune condition with an infectious etiology.",

For example, it is commonly believed that obesity is a causative factor in the development of diabetes (Hibbert-Jones et al., 2004). In fact, patients with Type 2 diabetes are so likely to become morbidly obese that the two conditions are sometimes collectively referred to as \u201cdiabesity\u201d (Bailey, 2009). Obesity has been tied to microbial composition in the gut (Turnbaugh et al., 2006), the result of a microbial process. Roesch et al. found that the onset of Type 1 diabetes was tied to the presence of specific bacteria in the murine gut (Roesch et al., 2009). Additionally, at least one microbial species, Streptomyces achromogenes, secretes a substance, streptozocin, which can directly induce Type 1 diabetes (Bolzan and Bianchi, 2002). The diabetes disease process would also make it substantially harder for the immune system to regulate microbial gut composition. In particular, species that are extremely effective at extracting calories from food may thrive while their innocuous counterparts may find themselves out-competed. The expression of hormones that regulate appetite, such as leptin or ghrelin, could also become dysregulated by the bacterial microbiota (Fetissov et al., 2008). For example, H. pylori infection leads to a decrease in circulating ghrelin through a reduction in ghrelin-producing cells in the gastric mucosa (Weigt and Malfertheiner, 2009). In some cases, this could cause weight gain even in the absence of excess calorie consumption (English et al., 2002). In light of the above, obesity and diabetes might better be described as developing simultaneously. Treatments aimed at addressing those underlying factors contributing to both disease states might well prove the most effective.",

Hoffman et al. found that when the bacterial species Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus were incubated together, P. aeruginosa created a protein, HQNO, which protected S. aureus from eradication by commonly used aminoglycoside antibiotics such as tobramycin (Hoffman et al., 2006). Besides, in cases of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus co-infection in the presence of HQNO, small-colony variants of S. aureus are selected for, making S. aureus more difficult for the immune system to target. Although we are far from understanding the full nature of these microbial interactions, it is clear that a microbiota constantly evolves so that the symptoms of any given disease are seldom static.",

For example, a 2008 study of parents of children with autism found they were more likely to have been hospitalized for a mental disorder than parents of control subjects, with schizophrenia being more common among case mothers and fathers compared with respective control parents (Daniels et al., 2008). In the case of schizophrenia and autism, both have been associated with prenatal viral infection (Fatemi et al., 2008). While a fetus can acquire these and many other pathogens directly, successive infection dictates that as children age they will manifest with inflammatory symptoms that may differ from those of their parents. Major factors that would influence the development of a discrete inflammatory diagnosis include the mix of species acquired, the sequence in which the pathogens are acquired, the subsequent changes in gene expression caused by the pathogens, and the profound effect on the body\u2019s proteins, enzymes, and metabolites caused by these changes. Because the adaptive immune response in infants takes several weeks to develop, infants are particularly prone to picking up pathogens during the first weeks of life (Bisgaard et al., 2007). Such pathogens could be acquired from any family or friends in contact with the child, especially the grandparents, who probably harbor some of the highest pathogenic loads. Palmer et al. found that infants pick up many of the species that make up their gut flora from family members within just a few weeks of birth, suggesting that nongut bacteria may easily be acquired during this time as well (Palmer et al., 2007).",

An exception would occur if the disease offers a survival advantage. For example, the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis may confer resistance to tuberculosis (Poolman and Galvani, 2007). The Mendelian disorder sickle cell anemia is common in tropical countries because it confers resistance to malaria. With malaria, researchers can quantify the rate by generation at which the gene for sickle cell anemia is dropped from the population in the absence of an evolutionary advantage \u2013 as is the case when people migrate away from malaria-infested areas. However, no autoimmune diagnosis has been shown to confer any sort of beneficial survival trait. Under these circumstances, one would expect any faulty gene or network of genes associated with an autoimmune condition to be selected against, especially since many autoimmune conditions strike during the reproductive years. Chronic diseases have existed for thousands of years with manifestations of both arteriosclerosis (Azer, 1999) and cardiac disease observed in mummies of ancient Egypt (Miller et al., 2000). \u00d6tzi the Neolithic Iceman who lived around 3300 BC had arthritis, allowing ample time for any alleles associated with autoimmune disease to be eliminated via natural selection (Dickson et al., 2003).

Similarly, anti-EBNA-1 antibodies are able to bind lupus-specific autoantigens such as Sm or Ro (Harley and James, 2006). Casali and Slaughter found that, in humans, EBV is a polyclonal B cell activator, and in vitro transformation with EBV results in production of rheumatoid factor (RF) (Casali et al., 1987; Slaughter et al., 1978). Possnett et al. argues that high titers of RF are not only associated with severe rheumatoid arthritis but also appear in a number of other diseases including viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections (Posnett and Edinger, 1997). Maturation of RF can be initiated by chronic infections (Djavad et al., 1996). For example, patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis, which is frequently tied to the presence of Streptococcus, also often present with high levels of RF (Russell et al., 1992). Williams et al. showed that once the offending infectious agent is removed with antibiotic therapy, the RF disappears (Williams and Kunkel, 1962). Similarly, the autoimmune disease thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is mediated by what are considered to be anti-platelet autoantibodies. However, Asahi et al. found that eradication of H. pylori is effective in increasing platelet count in nearly half of ITP patients infected with the bacterium (Asahi et al., 2006). Barzilai and team also found that Hepatitis B shares amino acid sequences with different autoantigens, further suggesting that the so-called autoantibodies may actually be created in response to pathogens (Barzilai et al., 2007). Autoantibodies have been detected in patients without autoimmune disease during periods of infection. Berlin et al. collected sera from 88 patients with acute infections (41 bacterial, 23 viral, 17 parasitic, and 7 rikettsial (Berlin et al., 2007)). Elevated titers of autoantibodies including annexin-V, prothrombin, ASCA, ANA, or antiphospholipid antibodies were detected in approximately half of the subjects, with 34 individuals harboring elevated titers of at least two \u201cautoantibodies.\u201d",

This means that what we now consider to be autoantibodies in many autoimmune diagnoses may also indicate the presence of pathogens, but pathogens that have yet to be fully characterized and named. Thus, in addition to looking for antibodies to well-characterized pathogens, it is also important that we look for antibodies indicating the presence of the underlying chronic microbiota, some of which we may also be mistaking for autoantibodies. Like the pathogens that may create them, many of these antibodies may not yet be detected by standard testing. If this is the case, hundreds of pathogen-induced antibodies may exist and impact the autoimmune disease state, but the possible detection and correlation of such antibodies with specific components of the microbiota remains difficult until a much larger portion of the microbiota has been characterized.",

According to Bozic, oxidative alterations, affecting either the hypervariable region or the receptor site of IgGs, may influence their functions (Bozic et al., 2007). Similarly, McIntyre reported the appearance and disappearance of antiphospholipid antibodies subsequent to oxidation reactions in human blood (McIntyre, 2004). Dimitrov et al. have shown that a fraction of antibodies present in all healthy individuals begin to recognize large number of self-antigens only after a transient exposure to certain protein-destabilizing conditions, including low or high pH, high salt concentration, chaotropic factors, and redox-active agents (Dimitrov et al., 2008). This points to at least one mechanism whereby the oxidative stress that accumulates in inflamed tissue could be at least partly responsible for the apparent polyspecificity of antibodies and autoantibodies.",

Eighty-two of the remaining 137 patients were followed up for several years. At the end of the study, 52% of these patients had also developed SLE.

The result is that many doctors still believe that nonmucosal surfaces of the body are largely sterile and that bacteria and other pathogens are not driving factors in the autoimmune processes. Instead, the standard of care for patients with autoimmune disease continues to be corticosteroids and TNF-alpha blocking medications. According to a 2008 report, TNF-alpha inhibitors accounted for 80% of RA drug sales in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Use of these immunosuppressants is still grounded in the theory that autoimmune disease results from an overly exuberant immune response and these drugs are administered without consideration for the presence of a metagenome. Whether helpful or harmful, there is no question that by dramatically slowing the immune response, such therapies must necessarily and profoundly affect the composition, development, and stability of the human microbiota.",

On the contrary, one of the side effects of TNF-alpha inhibitors is an increased risk of tuberculosis. Several studies have shown that TNF-alpha production is required for the proper expression of acquired specific resistance following infection with M. tuberculosis (Allie et al., 2008; Arend et al., 2003). So if we inhibit TNF-alpha expression, we would expect a long-term increase in the prevalence of not only tuberculosis, but also in any of the autoimmune or inflammatory diseases already associated with chronic forms of mycobacteria and other bacteria (Bull et al., 2003; Burnham et al., 1978).",

Subjects are also administered sub-inhibitory bacteriostatic antibiotics, which weaken bacterial ribosomes so that pathogens can more easily be targeted by the reactivated immune system. Nearly all of the hundreds of patients to start the therapy reported the predicted increase in specific symptoms of their autoimmune diagnosis. After months, or sometimes years, of dealing with these symptomatic flares, the very symptoms that waxed and waned in synchronism with antibiotic administration began to disappear, resulting in improvement and, in many cases, eventual resolution of the disease process. This response has been noted in the widely varying diagnoses of sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Type 2 diabetes, uveitis, Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, ankylosing spondylitis, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia among others.

            "text": "The most viable hypothesis for these temporary surges in disease symptoms and inflammatory markers is that treatment medications allow the immune system to mount an effective attack on an intracellular microbiota, such as the microbiota observed by Wirostko et al. It is reasonable to expect that when intraphagocytic pathogens are killed, some of the host cells will also undergo apoptosis, phagocytosis, or simply disintegration, leading to an increase in inflammation. For over 100 years, researchers have noted that the death of acute and persistent pathogens is accompanied by a surge in inflammation. They have attributed the temporary rise in inflammation to an increase in endotoxin and cytokine release upon bacterial death. Known as the Jarisch\u2013Herxheimer reaction, or immunopathology, this phenomenon has been previously demonstrated after antibiotic administration in diseases including tuberculosis (Cheung and Chee, 2009), borreliosis (Vidal et al., 1998), tick-borne relapsing fever (Mitiku and Mengistu, 2002), multiple sclerosis (Kissler, 2001), Whipple disease (Peschard et al., 2001), and syphilitic alopecia (Pareek, 1977), among others. Zinkernagel also observed immunopathology in the mice he had infected with a persistent neuro-active virus (Zinkernagel et al., 2009). Similarly, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a condition seen in some cases of AIDS following the use of antiretroviral drugs. As the immune system begins to recover, it responds to previously acquired opportunistic infections with an overwhelming inflammatory response that, like the immunopathological reaction we observe, makes the symptoms of the infection temporarily worse (Shelburne et al., 2002). At this point in time, the exact species or forms of bacteria potentially killed by any one subject in our own study cohort remain unknown. As the focus of the HMP moves beyond the mucosal surfaces, and catalogs L-forms and other intracellular species within body tissues, a clearer picture of disease pathogenesis will emerge. However, as long as patients continue to report improvement and recovery, determining the exact nature of pathogens being targeted by the therapy has not been a high priority, given the limited resources currently allocated to this research team.",

Yet, if bacteria drive the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammation, and chronic bacterial death invariably results in temporary increases in discomfort, then treatments that mitigate symptoms may well do so at the expense of proliferation in pathogenic components of the microbiota. Commonly used immunosuppressive compounds include vitamin D, which, although its immunosuppressive properties have now been identified (Arnson et al., 2007), is now viewed as the ultimate inexpensive wonder drug (Holick, 2008). Frequent use of vitamin D, as well as other substances that slow immune activity, could at least partially account for the recently increased prevalence of nearly every autoimmune disease (Luque et al., 2006).",

This divergence, which placed the cathelicidin pathway under VDR control only in humans and closely related primates, remained under purifying selection for the past 55\u201360 million years, and yet even cathelicidin in primates is not identical to that in man. Eventually, the pathway evolved to become a key component of a novel innate immune response unique to human infection. Because the murine VDR does not express cathelicidin, there is less of an evolutionary incentive for components of the murine microbiota to dysregulate its expression.
