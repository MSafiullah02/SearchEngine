In patients with BOS, areas with obstructed airways cannot empty and remain more radiolucent, while in areas that have normal airways the density increases during the expiratory phase. In a study by fi ve of six patients with initial false-positive fi ndings (with signifi cant air trapping but an FEV 1 > 80% of baseline) later developed BOS, which suggests that expiratory CT may contribute to the early detection of the condition. Conversely, air trapping has a very high negative predictive value, i.e. a low score of air trapping in a patient with declining lung function makes the diagnosis of BOS very unlikely. Quantification of air trapping using expiratory HR showed a good correlation between BOS grade and percentage of expiratory trapping, with a cut-off level of more than 32% as an early indicator for BO ).",

The decrease in donor organ pool by performing double-lung procedures is unsatisfactory considering the long waiting time of Transverse CT section in a single-lung transplant recipient. Native fi brotic lung (right) shows increased density, whereas the density of the transplanted left lung is normal more than 18 months to receive lung transplantation (Trulock et al. 2005 ). This trend is, however, most likely motivated by better overall survival results, by better lung function and fewer occurring complications after double-lung transplantation ( Trulock et al. 2005) . To date, the procedure of choice is single or bilateral lung transplantation, with the limited number of donor organs determining the surgical approach in individual situations. The formerly common heart-lung transplantation under cardiopulmonary bypass is now rarely performed. Bilateral transplantation is usually performed sequentially with two single-lung transplants. If the rarely employed extracorporeal support is necessitated, it is instituted through the femoral approach. The surgical approach has been modifi ed and the original clamshell incision has been replaced by two small anterior thoracotomies (Venuta et al. 2005) . Donor shortage has led to the development of living lobar transplantation. In living lobar transplantation, one donor provides a right lower lobe, the other donor a left lower lobe to a single bilateral lobar recipient (Fig. 5.2.4) . One transplant center describes an overall signifi cant morbidity of 4.6% and no donor mortality in living donor transplantation (Starnes et al. 2004 ). The shortage of donor lungs suitable for children and small adults has led to the development of the \"splitlung\" technique. In this procedure, the left lung is separated into two lobes. The left lower lobe is used for left lung transplant and the left upper lobe for Transplanted lung and native lung show marked differences in size and density cipient with excellent short-and long-term outcome (Artemiou et al. 1999; Couetil et al. 1997 ).",

Another reason for the diagnostic diffi culty is the timely occurrence overlap between \"normal\" postoperative complications such as mild, transient pulmonary edema, post-biopsy nodules (Fig. 5. 2.5), or postoperative atelectasis (Fig. 5.2.6 ), or chest wall defects ( Fig. 5.2.7) , and the potentially serious complications related to transplantation such as severe reperfusion edema and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Fig. 5.2.8) .

Up to 98% of patients present with these radiological fi ndings in the fi rst postoperative chest radiograph ( Anderson et al. 1995; Kundu et al. 1998) . Simultaneously, patients who had mild interstitial abnormalities on the initial chest radiograph usually present with normal fi ndings by day 10 (Davis and Pasque 1995). There is poor correlation between the severity of radiographic fi ndings and the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (Davis and Pasque 1995) . Although most patients experience radiographic changes from reperfusion edema, only 5%-10% of patients with radiologically apparent moderate or severe early graft dysfunction develop early graft failure (Davis and Pasque 1995) .

Patients who are seronegative for CMV before the procedure and in whom primary infection occurs as the result of the transplantation of an organ from a seropositive recipient are at greatest risk for severe infection, particularly pneumonitis (Ettinger et al. 1993) . Pneumonitis is the most common presentation in CMV disease following lung transplantation, although hepatitis, gastroenteritis, or colitis can also occur ( Shreeniwas et al. 1996) . A common way to prevent primary CMV infection in the lung-transplant recipient when either the donor or the recipient is seropositive is the initiation of ganciclovir prophylactically at the time of transplantation or preemptively when an increasing viral burden is detected Soghikian et al. 1996) . Another strategy to prevent infection with CMV in the recipient is the use of seronegative donors and screened blood products. Unfortunately, although this reduces the risk of infection to negligible levels, this strategy is logically associated with increased waiting times before transplantation, since the majority of donors have been exposed to CMV (Arcasoy and Kotloff 1999) .",

Radiological fi ndings which suggest acute rejection are new, worsening or persisting opacities 5-10 days after transplantation, new or increasing pleural effusions and septal lines without other signs of left ventricular failure (Fig. 5.2 .11) (Bergin et al. 1990) . Although these radiographic changes in the chest radiograph are common in early episodes of rejection, the chest fi lm alone as a follow-up is nonspecifi c in early post transplant recipients. On the other hand, a \"normal\" postoperative chest radiograph does not rule out acute rejection. In a study by Kundu et al. for instance, chest radiograph fi ndings were found to be abnormal in only about 50% of instances of biopsyproven acute rejection (Kundu et al. 1999) . Because of poorly specifi c manifestations and chronological overlapping of other likely complications such as failure or infection, it is often very diffi cult to diagnose acute rejection and differentiate it from other complications that are also clinically similar. Further, retrospective epidemiologic analyses have demonstrated that three or more episodes of acute rejection are the major risk factors for the subsequent development of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), which puts even more weight on correctly diagnosing and effectively treating acute rejection (Keller et al. 1995) .",

In the study of Tamm et al. (1997) the benefi t of surveillance biopsies was questioned. In this study, 51 heart-lung transplant recipients who underwent surveillance transbronchial biopsies were compared with 75 pa-tients who received heart-lung transplants without routine surveillance biopsies.

This is usually done in the inpatient setting, although selected patients who are clinically stable can be treated as outpatients. The outpatient regimen is the same, with intravenous methylprednisolone at home or in a chemotherapy infusion center (Chakinala and Trulock 2003) . Resolution occurs rapidly in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of rejection. The clinical symptoms of acute rejection usually improve over 24-48 h, and the physiologic abnormalities begin to improve in the same time frame and return to baseline over several weeks. Since the risk of developing CMV is higher in patients receiving augmented immunosuppression, many centers administer ganciclovir (5 mg/kg IV bid) during the period of augmented immunosuppression. This practice has been successful in renal transplant recipients, for whom the risk of CMV disease is reduced when antiviral therapy is administered during intravenous steroid therapy for acute rejection (Hibberd et al. 1995) .",

Manifestations can include low-grade fever, shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, and changes in measured pulmonary function. In both entities, the chest radiograph may demonstrate perihilar infi ltrates, interstitial edema, focal consolidation, or pleural effusions (Shreeniwas et al. 1996) . The point in time at which a disease manifests radiographically may provide clues to its etiology. CMV infection is rarely detected before the second week after transplantation, and the mean time to the initial episode of CMV pneumonitis is 55 days (Smith et al. 1998) . In comparison, acute rejection has a variable time course, but may occur within the fi rst 2-3 weeks after lung transplantation, when CMV infection would not be expected. For this reason, surveillance fi ber optic bronchoscopy is usually performed whenever there is a clinical indication and decline of spirometric values in the absence of recently untreated organisms identifi ed by sputum culture (Kukafka et al. 1997 ). However, it should be noted that even histologically the differentiation of rejection from infection can be at times diffi cult, since features suggesting rejection are also present in viral infection, and, most commonly, in CMV infection (Chakinala and Trulock 2003) . In particular, the lymphocytic infi ltrate that accompanies such infections or the presence of acute infl ammatory cells, such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes, make the histological diagnosis diffi cult. Alveolar infl ammation -as opposed to vascular or airway-centered infl ammation -in combination with viral inclusions or the presence of infectious pathogens on special staining is more indicative of infection. In the presence of active infection, it is impossible to make the diagnosis of rejection with certainty. The approach in such situations is to treat the infection and then repeat the biopsies to assess any contribution of rejection to the patient's clinical syndrome (Chakinala and Trulock 2003) . For all the above-mentioned reasons it is essential to understand the importance of interdisciplinary work-up of patients presenting with postoperative complications to achieve the correct diagnosis and treatment.",

Synonymous with bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), it leads to a submucosal fi brosis of the small airways, and consequently to luminal obliteration and often to obstructive airfl ow limitation (Arcasoy and Kotloff 1999; Boehler and Estenne 2000; Chamberlain et al. 1994 ). This chronic lymphoproliferative process is multifocal and may spare whole parts of the affected lung, while literally destroying the lung function (Boehler and Estenne 2000) . Therefore, while the diagnosis of BO is based on the histological fi ndings obtained at biopsy, a negative transbronchial biopsy does not exclude BO ( Boehler and Estenne 2000; Chamberlain et al. 1994) . Therefore, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation devised a standardized nomenclature proposing the use of a spirometric defi nition for a clinical diagnosis Estenne et al. 2002) . They also made a distinction between histologically proven BO and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). The latter is a clinical term and is applied to the situation in which there is \"graft deterioration secondary to progressive airways disease for which there is no other cause\" in the absence of histological evidence of BO with sustained fall in FEV 1 to a level of 80% or less of the peak value after transplantation . The mortality rate associated with BOS ranges from 25% to 56%; the risk increases with the time elapsed after diagnosis has been made (Bando et al. 1995a; Keller et al. 1995; Nathan et al. 1995; Sundaresan et al. 1995) . Because the occurrence of BOS increases with time, centers with a longer experience report higher prevalence rates, and centers that have presented their results in multiple publications report higher prevalence rates in a later publication . Usually the onset of BOS is at 3 months after transplantation. The natural evolution of BOS has been described to follow one of three patterns: (1) rapid, relentless decline after onset; (2) initial rapid deterioration followed by stabilization; and (3) subtle onset and slow, relentless progression (Levine and Bryan 1995; Nathan et al. 1995) . Retrospective epidemiologic analyses have demonstrated that three or more episodes of acute rejection are the major risk factor for the subsequent development of BO (Bando et al. 1995b; Boehler et al. 1998; Keller et al. 1995) .",

            "text": "Transbronchial biopsy is still considered the fi nal proof of BO. However, the reported sensitivity and sensibility of transbronchial biopsy in diagnosing BOS have been diverting (Chamberlain et al. 1994) . For example, one study reported a sensitivity of 17% and a specifi city of 94.5% for a single set of transbronchial biopsies (Chamberlain et al. 1994 ). Another study reported a rate of 15% histological confi rmation in patients clinically diagnosed with BOS (Kramer et al. 1993b) . Another study concluded that transbronchial biopsies confi rmed the diagnosis in 82% of their patients who developed clinical BOS (Bando et al. 1995b ). In contrast Sundaresan et al. (1995) noted that among 77 patients diagnosed with chronic rejection, the diagnosis was made on the basis of declining FEV 1 in 52%. Only 9% of patients had a histologically proven diagnosis without the typical clinical physiologic abnormalities, whereas 39% had both positive histology and declining spirometry . Because of these differing data, centers have adopted different approaches to making the diagnosis of BOS. Although the use of transbronchial biopsy in this setting is debated, many lung transplantation centers feel that it may aid in earlier diagnosis and therefore facilitate earlier therapy (Kukafka et al. 1997) . Reasons for a confi rming biopsy include exclusion of other causes of the clinical syndrome and establishment of the diagnosis prior to attempting therapy and/or retransplantation. Although no therapy has a good track record, many institutions have clinical protocols examining the effi cacy of new approaches such as photopheresis, total lymphoid irradiation, plasmapheresis, and inhaled ciclosporin (Iacono et al. 2004 ).",

Areas of decreased attenuation, very often in the early onset of disease not seen on inspiratory CT sections, are easier detected on end-expiratory CT sections (Figs. 5.2.12, 5.2.13) (Arakawa and Webb 1998; Desai and Hansell 1997; Lucidarme et al. 1998; Ng et al. 1999; Verschakelen et al. 1998 ). The unchanging low attenuation in expiratory CT sections, and also the absence of a decreasing cross-sectional area of the affected part of the lung are helpful in detecting air trapping (Stern and Frank 1994) . Expiratory CT can also be used in differentiating between the three main causes of a mosaic pattern (small airways disease, i.e., BO, infi ltrative lung disease, and occlusive pulmonary vascular disease) in cases where inspiratory CT is problematic (Arakawa and Webb 1998; Stern et al. 1995) . It is important however to keep in mind that in patients with widespread BO, end-expiratory CT sections may appear almost identical to the inspiratory CT sections, simply because of the severity of the air trapping (Fig. 5.2 .14). In these cases there is no inhomogeneity of attenuation or change in crosssectional area of any part of the lung. This important sign of air trapping on HRCT sections obtained at end-expiration in comparison to inspiratory HRCT sections is becoming a routinely performed examination (Arakawa and Webb 1998) .",

            "text": "In one of the fi rst CT studies of BO, Turton et al. (1981) examined 15 patients who fulfi lled the criteria of \"obliterative bronchiolitis\" with thin-section CT (interspaced 3-mm sections, contiguous 10-mm sections). In 5 of the 15 patients the chest radiographs were normal and the remaining 10 patients showed \"limited vascular attenuation and hyperinfl ation\". In 13 of the 15 patients \"patchy irregular areas of high and low attenuation in variable proportions, accentuated in expiration\" were observed. These fi ndings, together with two cases by Eber et al. (1993) were the fi rst reports to identify regional inhomogeneity of the density of the lung parenchyma as the key CT feature of BO. This noninvasive ap-proach to early diagnosis and follow-up of air trapping on HRCT scans has become more accepted recently Knollmann et al. 2004; Konen et al. 2004) . The identifi cation of areas of ground glass opacifi cation on HRCT after transplantation, with an inclining incidence 6 months after transplantation, was described as very suggestive but nonspecifi c (Loubeyre et al. 1995) . The reported sensitivity and specifi city of HRCT for diagnosing BO associated with numerous other predisposing conditions or causative agents has already been presented; for example, MacLeod's syndrome, (Lucaya et al. 1998; Marti-Bonmati et al. 1989; Moore et al. 1992; Zhang et al. 1999) . Later studies went further to apply these fi ndings specifi cally to BO in lungtransplant patients and provided further evidence that air trapping on expiratory CT scans is an accurate indicator of BO Worthy et al. 1997) . These fi ndings were, however, based on a small number of patients and a control group was not used. Later on larger study groups reported the reliable accuracy of expiratory thin-section CT to diagnose BOS and complemented the clinical follow-up of lung-transplant recipients (Fig. 5.2.15 ) . Other studies found that the diagnosis of BOS on expiratory thin-section CT was not accurate enough to warrant a role in the followup of these patients (Konen et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2000; Miller et al. 2001 ). These diverting fi ndings however, for the most part, probably refl ect differences in examination protocols and scoring systems, and varying patient populations. took on this uncertainty by examining more patients and analyzing longer periods of follow-up CT examination, and proved that air trapping at a certain threshold is a relatively sensitive, specifi c, and accurate method for diagnosing BOS. In a later study Bankier et al. (2003) also examined whether changes in air trapping at sequential CT examinations result from an inherent variability of air trapping or from the variability of the underlying BOS. In this study, Bankier et al. (2003) showed that the anatomic distribution and extent of air trapping in functionally stable heart-lung transplant patients are reproducible characteristics and hence may contribute to the early detection of subclinical chronic rejection of the allograft lung and may be a major tool in the follow-up of such patients (Bankier et al. 2003) .",

Two reports assessed the value of prolonged oral azithromycin therapy (250 mg PO \u00d7 5 days, then 250 mg PO every other day) in patients with BOS (Gerhardt et al. 2003; Verleden and Dupont 2004; Yates et al. 2005) . This approach was associated with signifi cant improvements in FEV 1 for some, but not all, patients. These reports have involved only small numbers of patients, and there is little convincing evidence that any of the treatment modalities can be considered effective therapy that dramatically changes the natural history of BOS. It seems that the best strategy to deal with BOS is attempted primary prevention, i.e., aggressive early immunosuppression to eliminate early episodes of acute rejection, since there is no reliable therapy once patients develop symptomatic airfl ow obstruction.",

Early experience suggested that the outcome was not as good as with the fi rst transplant, and some believe that BOS tends to recur in retransplant recipients in an accelerated fashion (Novick et al. 1998 ). The risk, however, does not appear to be signifi cantly different from that with the fi rst transplant. In a review of 230 retransplantation cases performed in 47 centers between 1985 and 1996 1-year survival was signifi cantly lower (47%) than for the initial transplant (Novick et al. 1998 ). Among the long-term survivors, however, the risk of developing BO by 2 years was 38%, a rate similar to that of fi rst transplants. Similarly in a single-center series of 15 patients undergoing retransplantation for BOS it was noted that 60% were still alive at 1 year. Surviving patients had a 28% likelihood of recurrent BOS within 3 years after transplantation (Brugiere et al. 2003) . Opinions concerning the appropriateness of retransplantation as a treatment of BOS vary widely, in part shaped by the recognition that most centers have more potential fi rst-time recipients than donors, and that mortality on the waiting list is a signifi cant problem. As a result of these considerations, transplant programs vary in policy concerning the availability of retransplantation as a therapeutic option.",

Aspergillus infection after lung transplantation can be classifi ed into two major categories, saprophytic colonization and disease. Particularly devitalized cartilage and foreign suture material of the fresh bronchial anastomosis may create vulnerable sites for Aspergillus. Aspergillus may also diffusely infect the airways and cause mucosal edema, ulceration and the formation of pseudomembranes (Kramer et al. 1991) . One series including 101 patients reported the development of invasive aspergillosis in 14% (Husni et al. 1998) . The primary site of lung disease is usually the allograft, but the native lung has been the nidus in some single-lung recipients (McDougall et al. 1993; Westney et al. 1996; Yeldandi et al. 1995) . The infection itself has not always been reported to be the ultimate cause of death, however up to 30%-75% mortality rates have been connected with Aspergillus disease. Most of the deaths have occurred in recipients with pneumonia or disseminated aspergillosis (Cahill et al. 1997; Kramer et al. 1991; Westney et al. 1996; Yeldandi et al. 1995) .",

The risk of developing an invasive disease, however, is strongly associated with early post transplant colonization. One study of 151 lung transplant recipients found that patients who had Aspergillus fumigatus isolated from the airway within the fi rst 6 months of transplantation had an 11-fold greater risk of developing invasive disease compared with those not colonized during this period (Cahill et al. 1997) .",

Other less frequently observed but reported disease recurrences after lung transplantation are idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (Calabrese et al. 2002; Wroblewski et al. 1997) , alpha-1-antitrypsin defi ciency (Mal et al. 2004) , pulmonary veno-occlusive disease ( Izbicki et al. 2005) , diffuse panbronchiolitis (Baz et al. 1995) , pulmonary Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (Fig. 5.2 .21) (Etienne et al. 1998; Gabbay et al. 1998; Habib et al. 1998 ), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (Nine et al. 1994; O'Brien et al. 1995) , desquamative interstitial pneumonia (Verleden 1998) , and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (Parker and Novotny 1997) . Particularly sarcoidosis has been described to have a high pathologic recurrence rate in some small series (Collins et al. 2001) . It usually is discovered incidentally when granulomas are noted on lung biopsy specimens, but these pathologic recurrences have not adversely affected the long-term outcome (Johnson et al. 1993) . As an example, a series of 12 patients found post transplantation recurrence of sarcoidosis in 3, but reported 3-and 5-year survival rates comparable to those of patients transplanted for other diseases (Walker et al. 1998) . Because the history of lung transplantation is brief compared with the natural history of the underlying diseases, it would not be surprising for recurrence of other diseases to be described in the future among longterm surviving patients.",
