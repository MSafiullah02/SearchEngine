Although earlier reports documented outbreaks associated with BCoV mostly in dairy cattle,1 subsequent reports have confirmed similar outbreaks and clinical signs in 6- to 9-month-old feedlot calves2 and also in captive wild ruminants including white-tailed deer, sambar deer, and waterbuck.3 The morbidity rate of WD outbreaks is high (50%-100%), but the mortality rate is usually low (1%-2%) unless complicated by the presence of other agents such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) or secondary bacterial infections.1., 2. Besides BCoV fecal shedding and seroconversion to BCoV or BVDV being significant epidemiologic risk factors for WD in dairy herds, various host and environmental factors may also contribute to disease expression.1., 8., 9. These include age of animal (2\u20136-year-olds at most risk) and larger herd size, close confinement of cattle (tie stall instead of free stalls), use of manure-handling equipment for feed, and poor barn ventilation. The latter environmental factors probably relate to the documented fecal-oral and presumed aerosol transmission routes for BCoV.",
