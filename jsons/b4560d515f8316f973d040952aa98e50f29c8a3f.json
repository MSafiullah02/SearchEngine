Eleven of these 16 are not known to occur in African lakes at lower elevation, and eight taxa (or 50% of total species richness) appear restricted to the specific habitat of cold lakes above 3900 m, where night-time freezing is frequent year-round. The faunal transition zone coincides broadly with the Ericaceous zone of terrestrial vegetation (c. 3000-4000 m). Snowline depression during the Quaternary ice ages must have facilitated dispersion of cold-stenothermous species among the high mountains of equatorial East Africa, but less so from or to the Palaearctic region via the Ethiopian highlands.",

            "text": "Concerns about the environmental effects of anthropogenic climate change are motivating considerable effort to model and predict the impact of global warming on regional ecosystems. This is particularly true for the high-mountain regions of tropical Africa, where climate change is expected to result in complete loss of ice caps and glaciers. On Mount Kilimanjaro (Tanzania), the ice cap covering its western (Kibo) top has shrunk by 80% in the last century; at this rate, all 'eternal' snow will disappear within two decades (Thompson et al., 2002) . Glaciers on Mount Kenya (Kenya) have shrunk by 40% since 1963 (Hastenrath, 1995) . Likewise, in the Rwenzori Mountains (Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo) the ice field of Elena Glacier is thinning, and its front has retreated several hundreds of metres in the last 50 years (Kaser & Osmaston, 2002; M\u00f6lg et al., 2003) . This rapid retreat is consistent with warming of the tropical middle troposphere in recent decades (Hastenrath & Kruss, 1992; Gaffen et al., 2000) , though a longer-time decrease of precipitation and air humidity may be the principal cause of the near-continuous retreat of the African glaciers since 1850 (Hastenrath, 2001; Kaser et al., 2004) . Clearly, loss of permanent ice from the tops of Africa's highest mountains will have profound effects on the hydrology and temperature regime of alpine lakes located downstream from those glaciers. This by itself may have a severe impact on the integrity and function of these scarce Afroalpine aquatic ecosystems, and add to the direct effects of a regional rise in air temperature. Consequently, there is an urgent need to characterize the aquatic fauna and flora of these (still relatively) undamaged Afroalpine lakes, to determine their uniqueness in relation to both African lowland lakes and alpine lakes in temperate regions, and to find adequate means to monitor future changes in their biological diversity.",

Standing waters within this altitude range in tropical Africa are still quite warm (surface temperatures of 18-26\u00b0C), and their chironomid fauna is similar to that of low-elevation lakes (Eggermont & Verschuren, 2004a,b) . Little information is available on the chironomid fauna in Africa's true high-mountain lakes, which occur above the tree line within the Afroalpine zone of the few sizeable mountain massifs higher than 3000 m. Their unique, perennially cold tropical standing-water habitat (L\u00f6ffler, 1964) may well be reflected in a distinct and vulnerable aquatic fauna.",

We studied samples (authors' own collection, July 2002) from five highly dilute lakes (surface-water conductivity between 6 and 26 lS cm )1 ) situated in the Alpine zone (Bujuku, Lower Kitandara, Upper Kitandara and Josephat's Pool; with mosses, giant heather, lobelias and groundsels around the lakes) and the Nival zone (Green Pool; an isolated permanent pool surrounded by rocks with lichens, no real vegetation), spanning elevations between 3909 and 4341 m. Due to logistic constraints at the time of sampling, data on lake depth and temperature are currently not available for these Rwenzori lakes; their pH ranges between 6.1 and 7.8 (Table 1) . In contrast to the study sites on Mount Kenya, where bottomsediment samples were collected from a boat, larval chironomid communities in the Rwenzori lakes were studied using ",

Specimens were attributed to a known morphotype when the minimum set of required diagnostic characters were recorded at least once per site. Morphotypes bearing no explicit resemblance with known African or Holarctic species and larval types are designated by their genus or tribe name followed by the name of the lake in which the most complete specimen was found, e.g. 'Larsia type Kitandara'. If no single diagnostically complete specimen was found, we used the name of a lake in which the taxon was sufficiently abundant to construct a composite diagnosis.",

It differs from larvae of the related Dicrotendipes septemmaculatus (Becker) mainly in having ventromental plates with more striae (c. 40-46 rather than c. 26-32), and a frontal apotome with smooth anterior margin, not displaying the irregular tubercles present in D. septemmaculatus (Contreras-Lichtenberg, 1988; Epler, 1988; Harrison, 1993) . Records of D. pilosimanus are restricted to South Africa and cool montane streams and ponds in East Africa (Harrison, 1993 (Harrison, , 2000a , whereas D. septemmaculatus seems to occur in warm low-and mid-elevation lakes throughout East and North Africa (Freeman, 1957; Epler, 1988) . Also Dicrotendipes collarti (Goetghebuer) has been reported from the East African mountains (Nyandarua Range in Kenya; Freeman, 1957) , but its larva is unknown. We found D. pilosimanus only on Mount Kenya, at all elevations (seven lakes between 1320 and 4575 m a.s.l.) but most abundantly in lakes below tree line. As its frontal apotome is not always preserved and the ventromental striae often difficult to count, we are aware that our material may include some D. septemmaculatus, especially in the mid-elevation lakes Nkunga and Rurie Swamp. Lake Nkunga Dicrotendipes include at least three true D. pilosimanus specimens, but some others are more likely to belong to D. septemmaculatus. Also some incomplete Dicrotendipes from mid-elevation Kenya lakes such as Ol Bolossat (c. 2358 m a.s.l.) and Narasha (c. 2764 m a.s.l.) which Eggermont & Verschuren (2004b) assigned to D. septemmaculatus may actually be D. pilosimanus, yet none of the several 100 Dicrotendipes specimens recovered from these and other lakes could be unambiguously assigned to it.",

This is illustrated in Fig. 42 , where the altitudinal distributions of the 16 taxa recorded in this study are shown together with those of eight chironomid taxa widely distributed in East African freshwater lakes, along a combined altitudinal gradient ranging from 935 to 4575 m a.s.l.

Today these ecosystems occur on seven mountain ranges in equatorial Africa (Mount Kenya, the Nyandarua (Aberdare) Range, Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Meru, Mount Elgon, the Rwenzori Mountains and the Virunga Mountains) and three mountain massifs in Ethiopia (Simien, Arsi and Bale), which are typically treated as a separate biogeographical region. The origins of Afroalpine biota are predominantly local (tropical African) or Palaearctic depending on the group, with typically smaller contributions from temperate South Africa and other distant sources (Harmsen et al., 1991) . In poorly dispersing terrestrial biota such as vascular plants (Hedberg, 1957; Harmsen et al., 1991) , mosses (Spence & Pocs, 1987) , flightless insects (Br\u00fchl, 1997) and spiders (Scharff, 1992) , each mountain has a significant component of locally endemic species. In plants and mosses, this component ranges from c. 2% on the Aberdares and Mount Meru to c. 14% in the Rwenzori, with a positive relationship to the area occupied, age and isolation from other mountains (Harmsen et al., 1991) . In flightless insects, genera can be distributed widely over the different mountains but at the species level local endemism is the rule rather then the exception (Br\u00fchl, 1997) . In contrast, highly mobile terrestrial biota such as mammals, birds and butterflies are mostly represented by eurytopic lowland species, and species diversity above the tree line is typically unimpressive.",

Night-time freezing can occur from c. 3000 m a.s.l. (i.e. the present-day tree line between Bamboo forest and the Ericaceous zone), but at 4000 m (transition between Ericaceous zone and Alpine zone) nocturnal frosts occur on 80-90% of the nights and almost throughout the year (Rundel, 1994) . The equatorial position of these mountain ranges creates daily oscillations in air temperature between )5 and 20\u00b0C in the Alpine and Nival zones, an order of magnitude greater than the seasonal change in maximum daytime temperature. In the deeper lakes, night-time water-surface cooling and convection creates bottom temperatures approaching 4\u00b0C, as in seasonally stratified lakes in coldtemperate regions. Shallow lakes often freeze over at night, and with the exception of the shallowest tarns, daytime warming heats up surface waters to, at most, 8-10\u00b0C (Table 1) . As almost all life processes in holometabolous insects (egg survival and hatching rate, larval growth and feeding, pupation, emergence, flight and fecundity) are under temperature control (Pinder, 1995) , African Chironomidae whose larvae are restricted to these alpine lakes and tarns must evidently be cold-stenothermal. All but one of the eight recorded cold-adapted taxa are relatively small forms belonging to the subfamilies Diamesinae, Orthocladiinae and Tanytarsini, which also dominate the chironomid fauna of alpine lakes and tarns in north-temperate regions (Walker & Mathewes, 1989; Lotter et al., 1997) . The Diamesinae in particular are a characteristic component of alpine chironomid faunas in the Holarctic region (North America and Eurasia). The three known East African Diamesinae species are restricted to the ultra-oligotrophic waters of glacial tarns and streams on Mount Kenya, Mount Kilimanjaro and the Rwenzori (Freeman & Cranston, 1980; Willassen & Cranston, 1986) . A handful of African Orthocladiinae (Cricotopus scottae, Cricotopus albitibia, Limnophyes natalensis, Nanocladius saetheri, Psectrocladius viridescens) are widely distributed in warm and productive lowland lakes (Tudorancea et al., 1989; Eggermont & Verschuren, 2004a) , but as a group the Orthocladiinae contribute significantly to chironomid faunal diversity only in well-oxygenated waters of fast-flowing streams (Harrison & Hynes, 1988) , cool forest rivers (Lehmann, 1979) and the rare unproductive African lakes at low elevation (e.g. Lake Tanganyika; Eggermont & Verschuren, 2003a) . Here in cold, unproductive mountain lakes we find Orthocladiinae to be common both in number of taxa (6 of 16, or 31.5%) and absolute abundance (49.0% of total yield).",

The other two morphotaxa of group (3) may include more than one biological species, therefore their apparent altitudinal distribution may be an artefact of inadequate discrimination of subfossil remains.

Given efficient long-distance dispersal of adult midges (Armitage et al., 1995) , there is no reason to expect a high proportion of local endemics (i.e. restricted to just one mountain range) among the Chironomidae inhabiting Africa's high-mountain lakes, unlike the situation in less mobile Afroalpine biota such as vascular plants, mosses and flightless insects.

Likewise, inventory of the forest river Kalengo in the Democratic Republic of Congo (c. 1800 m a.s.l.; Lehmann, 1979) yielded several species with continent-wide African distribution. Part of this pattern of widespread species distribution may be credited to the occurrence of cool forest-river systems over large contiguous areas in East and Central Africa. By contrast, true cold-water lakes with (bottom) temperatures of 4-5\u00b0C or less are restricted to the few isolated islands of Africa's highest mountain ranges, which are separated by large expanses of warm lowlands (Fig. 1) . Still, regional endemism in Afroalpine Chironomidae between the group of seven equatorial East African mountain ranges and other African highland regions is not likely to be substantial, if only because of the general lack of Afroalpine standing-water ecosystems outside of equatorial East Africa, with the exception of one lake and a handful of bogs in the Ethiopian Arsi and Bale Mountains.",

Willassen & Cranston (1986) suggested a more or less continuous dispersal route for alpine aquatic biota between the East African mountains and Eurasia during the mid-Tertiary period. This route would have stretched from the Caucasus through the Near East to the Ethiopian highlands, and allowed colonization of East Africa by strictly cold-stenothermal taxa. Prominent among these are Diamesa and African montane Orthocladiinae such as Chaetocladius melaleucus (Meigen) that are considered to have a Palaearctic or Nearctic origin (Willassen & Cranston, 1986) . Limnophyes minimus (Meigen) and L. natalensis (Kieffer), here combined into Epler's (2001) Limnophyes minimus group, are both widely distributed throughout Europe and North America, and even occur on some sub-Antarctic islands (Saether, 1990) . African Chironominae with montane distribution patterns are proposed to have used the same route but in either direction (Harrison & Hynes, 1988) . One example is Dicrotendipes pilosimanus (Kieffer), which besides Africa's eastern and southern highlands also occurs throughout the Middle East, the Balkans and the Oriental region (Epler, 1988) .",

Second, although Eocene volcanic activity in the incipient East African Rift System (c. 45-33 Ma) extruded sequences of flood basalt up to 2.5 km thick in present-day Ethiopia, northern Kenya and southern Arabia (Ebinger et al., 2000; Tiercelin & Lezzar, 2002) , there is no evidence for temporal continuity of high-mountain environments in East Africa between this period of early rifting in the north, and the main uplift of the Aberdares in the late Miocene, the Rwenzori in the Pliocene or the formation of Mount Kenya c. 3 Ma (Barker et al., 1988; Pickford et al., 1993; Ebinger et al., 2000) .",

During this period, global cooling relative to the Present has been the rule rather than the exception: interglacial climate conditions similar to those of the current Holocene epoch prevailed during c. 20% of the time (EPICA, 2004) . Therefore, faunal exchange between Africa's high-mountain environments and Eurasia has almost certainly been most prominent not during the mid Tertiary but during late Quaternary glacial episodes, and as recently as 15,000-20,000 years ago. It is commonly assumed that Afroalpine ecosystems persisted continuously since the late Pliocene (Axelrod & Raven, 1978; Harmsen et al., 1991) , but probably not much longer.

At that time, mean annual temperature in mountainous regions was reduced by 5-6\u00b0C (Porter, 2001) , and snowlines were depressed by 570-1000 m (Kaser & Osmaston, 2002) . Vegetation belts shifted downslope and contracted, extending the Afroalpine zone to c. 3200 m a.s.l. (Mahaney, 1989) . The seven current Afroalpine enclaves in equatorial East Africa must have increased somewhat in size (Harmsen et al., 1991) but not substantially so, and only very few new enclaves with probable Afroalpine abiotic conditions were formed in the Cherangani Hills of northern Kenya, the Ngorongoro area west of Mount Meru, and the Mitumba Range of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Only when including the entire faunal transition zone (Fig. 42) , of which the lower boundary may have extended to c. 2200 m, can it be proposed that cold-stenothermal African Chironomidae potentially enjoyed significantly more widespread distributions and increased dispersal between individual mountain systems during Quaternary glaciation periods. Broad swaths of highlands at that elevation lie both among the eastern (Mount Elgon, Mount Kenya, Nyandarua, Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Meru) and western (Rwenzori, Virunga) equatorial mountains, and among the three Ethiopian massifs, and substantial new stepping stones between these three mountain regions may have occurred in the Uganda-Sudan border region. For the aquatic midge larvae in question, the true limiting factor on glacial-time distribution would have been the occurrence of permanent open water bodies within the altitude range of suitable abiotic conditions, as is the case today.",

The faunal transition zone coincides broadly with the Ericaceous zone of terrestrial vegetation, where night freezing becomes increasingly more common with altitude. Eight taxa, or 50% of total species richness, appear restricted to the specific habitat of cold holomictic lakes in the Alpine and Nival zones (>3900 m a.s.l.), and can thus be considered true Afroalpine elements. The question of endemism among Afroalpine Chironomidae at either a local, regional or continental scale remains largely unanswered at this time, but taking into account the restricted occurrence of glacier-fed lakes and tarns on Africa's highest mountains we surmise that the chironomid fauna of these tropical cold-water ecosystems is potentially unique on a continental scale.",

            "text": "By virtue of their excellent preservation and their spatial and temporal integration of local community dynamics, chironomid larval death assemblages extracted from surface sediments are powerful biological proxy indicators to monitor the potentially dramatic hydrological and ecological changes associated with the retreat of Africa's alpine glaciers. In north-temperate regions, chironomid palaeoecology is already an established instrument to reconstruct past histories of climate-driven temperature and ecological change (Battarbee, 2000) . Initial demonstration, from surface-sediment larval death assemblages, of strong altitudinal and latitudinal gradients in chironomid species distribution (Walker & Mathewes, 1989; Walker & MacDonald, 1995) resulted in the development of chironomid-based quantitative inference models for reconstruction of past variations of air and water temperature in both North America and Europe Walker et al., 1997; Larocque et al., 2001) . Reconstruction of Africa's climate history from natural climate archives such as lake sediments will be essential to amend the current scarcity of information on natural tropical climate variability and help forecast the fate of Afrotropical ecosystems over the next centuries. Given the difficulty of separating the effects of changes in temperature and moisture balance on geochemical records of African climate change (Gasse, 2002) , an independent and reliable proxy indicator for past temperature change in Africa would be most welcome (Verschuren, 2003) . Documentation in this study of the distinct character of chironomid communities inhabiting Africa's true cold-water lakes is a first step towards chironomid-based reconstruction of past temperature change in Africa, and improved understanding of past and future tropical climate dynamics.",
