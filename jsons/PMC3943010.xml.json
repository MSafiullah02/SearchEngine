Brassicaceae), and a widely-used antiviral traditional Chinese medicine. As an officially approved medicinal material (Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2005), Isatidis Radix and its decoction (RIE) have been employed as a major herbal tonic in prevention and treatment against a wide range of viral infections, including seasonal flu and the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Lin et al., 2005). Regardless of the different subtypes of viruses and their constant mutations, RIE was found to be clinically effective against infections caused by various subtypes and strains of influenza viruses. The antiviral mechanism of RIE remains unclear, with no indication of the target of the antiviral action of RIE, an essential prerequisite to elucidation of the mechanism. There is, as yet, no explanation of the wide spectrum of activity against all strains of the influenza virus.",

Moreover, in this test, the incubation of 100 mg/mL RIE with cells and influenza A virus together raise the cells survival rate up to 91%, and the plaque inhibition rate up to 96%. The survival rate here is higher than its counterpart in the cytotoxicity test (53%) in the presence of high concentration of RIE.

Firstly, during IC50 evaluation, RIE was introduced to cells with the virus together instead of prior to virus incubation, which might provide an undervalued IC50. Secondly, as a mixture, RIE contains hundreds of compositions, of which a small proportion would be responsible for the efficacy. For example, only one fifth of total protein of Isatidis Radix is aqueous soluble. Nagai et al. have reported the anti-influenza virus activity of a glycoprotein from roots of Isatis tinctoria L. (Nagai et al., 1998). Therefore, aqueous soluble proteins may possibly contribute to the antiviral effects of Isatidis Radix. Purification of the effective components of RIE is in progress.",

Together these provide several opportunities for antiviral agents to inhibit the viral infectious cycle, by acting on either the host cells or the viruses. For example, some antibodies inhibit the attachment of viruses to cells (Reading and Dimmock, 2007). Peptidyl chloroalkyl ketone inhibitors prevent the fusion event by inhibiting cleavage of the precursor of HA (Tashiro and Rott, 1996); the approved drugs amantadine and rimantadine stop viral particles from releasing into the cytoplasm by the inhibition of viral particles uncoating (Pinto and Lamb, 2007); neuraminidase inhibitor, i.e. Tamiflu, prevents the budding of progeny virus from the cell membrane (Moscona, 2005).",

These assumptions are based on following observations. As any free RIE was thoroughly washed off after incubation with cells in all three groups, only those RIE who bound to the cell plasma membrane or internalised into the cell plasma would contribute to the rise of cell survival rates. Furthermore, because of the stronger effects of \u201cprotecting mode\u201d than \u201crepairing mode\u201d, it is crucial for RIE to participate cell-virus interaction in an early stage, particular prior to the presence of viruses.",

Furthermore, as it targets on an universal substance, the cell plasma membrane, this approach may function upon a wide range of enveloped viruses, regardless of their families, types, strains or year of epidemic.

(a) \u201cProtecting mode: with RIE pre-treatment\u201d, cells were incubated with viruses at 4\u00b0C , magnified \u00d75000; (b) \u201cControl: without RIE pre-treatment\u201d, cells were incubated with viruses at 4\u00b0C , magnified \u00d75000; Cells were fixed with Karnovsky's fixative, post-fixed with 1% OsO4 for 45 min, dehydrated in ethanol, treated with isoamyl acetate and dried to a critical point with HCP-2. The cells were mounted on stubs, coated with gold and observed with a scanning\nelectron microscope (JSM5310/LV, JEOL). Arrows: virus particles bound to the microvilli and other parts of plasma membrane.",
