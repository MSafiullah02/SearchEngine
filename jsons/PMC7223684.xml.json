Despite a growing body of sepsis-related research [10], there are no published studies evaluating oxygen regimens in patients with sepsis. Given this limited evidence base, we undertook a post hoc exploratory analysis to evaluate the effect of conservative vs. usual oxygen therapy on 90-day mortality and other patient-centered outcomes in the subset of patients with sepsis at the time of recruitment to ICU-ROX. We conducted this analysis to provide data on important outcomes to guide the design, powering, and execution of a future trial to test the hypothesis that conservative oxygen therapy would reduce 90-day mortality compared with usual oxygen therapy in patients with sepsis.",

To provide some confirmatory data regarding the fidelity of our approach to defining sepsis, we used registry data obtained from trial participants during the first 24 h in ICU [13].

Whilst not pre-specified, the analysis reported here has been conducted in accordance with the original analysis plan. Our decision to specify 90-day mortality as the primary end point for this analysis instead of ventilator-free days was based on an assessment that differences in 90-day mortality would more intuitively understood by clinicians. We reasoned that providing 95% CIs around 90-day mortality treatment estimates would provide a more clinically relevant estimate of likely treatment effects. The decision to use 90-day mortality as the primary outcome for this analysis was made after the primary ICU-ROX analyses were completed, but in advance of conducting the post hoc sepsis analysis. The sample size for the current analysis was determined by the number of patients with sepsis enrolled in ICU-ROX. However, based on a 90-day mortality rate of 36.2% in conservative oxygen therapy patients, a sample of 250 provides 80% power to detect an absolute reduction in mortality of 15.9% points using a two-tailed test at alpha of 0.05. Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. We defined the intention-to-treat population as all enrolled patients except those who withdrew consent for use of data. We did not impute missing values.",

Although our findings do not support our a priori hypothesis, there are plausible mechanisms by which using oxygen liberally without targeting hyperoxemia might benefit patients with sepsis. The consequences of infections might be reduced directly with use of oxygen via enhanced oxidative killing of bacteria, and indirectly, for patients who have wounds, by enhancing wound healing through re-epithelialization, blood vessel angiogenesis, and tissue collagen synthesis [17, 18]. Experimental evidence suggests that oxygen tension is reduced in infected tissues compared with non-infected tissues [19]. Moreover, neutrophil superoxide production is enhanced in the presence of high oxygen tension, thus potentially enhancing pathogen killing by the innate immune system [20]. For some patients with sepsis, oxygen delivery to the tissues may be impaired. In such patients, liberal provision of oxygen might be of particular value.",

Our analysis does not rule out the possibility that conservative use of oxygen in patients with sepsis results in either clinically important benefit or harm. Our study has additional limitations. As we have highlighted, this was a post hoc analysis; however, it was hypothesis-driven, rather than data-driven and is highly relevant to clinicians, because sepsis is a common disease in ICU practice [1]. The ICU-ROX data that were used to define sepsis were collected at baseline; however, the subcodes for infection obtained from the Adult Patient Database were not collected specifically for the trial and may not truly be baseline data. Although we did not prospectively identify patients whether or not patients had the requisite organ dysfunction to meet sepsis criteria, we used registry data to confirm that the vast majority fulfilled the contemporary definition of sepsis [12] within 24 h of ICU admission. Some patients who were not identified as having an infection-related admission diagnosis may still have had sepsis at baseline or developed it in the ICU. We did not collect information related to oxygen delivery such as lactate and central venous oxygen saturations or information on the use of antibiotics or methods of source control. We did not collect oxygen-related data beyond day 28. Although the difference in time-weighted mean PaO2 between treatment groups was not large, we still observed substantial and statistically significant separation between treatment groups in our trial in terms of a number of metrics of oxygen exposure, including a substantially higher number of hours with SpO2 \u2265 97% among patients assigned to usual oxygen. The clinical relevance of the difference in oxygen exposure between groups that we observed can only be established through the conduct of high-quality clinical trials with patient-centered end points such as mortality. If the magnitude of mortality treatment effect suggested by the point estimates observed in our trial turned out be the true effect, then the magnitude of separation in oxygen exposure we observed would clearly be clinically important. We submit that investigation of oxygen regimens should be added to the list of recently described priorities for research in sepsis and septic shock [21].",
