            "text": "A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome \u2212coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing a severe acute respiratory syndrome with its disease designated as COVID-19, emerged from its epicenter in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and is now a global pandemic. As of March 11, 2020, COVID-19 has been confirmed in 114 countries and involves 118,381 cases globally with 4,292 deaths. 1 Most reported infections are in China, followed by Italy, Iran, Republic of Korea, and the European Union. 1 Italy went into lockdown as a country on March 9, 2020, whereas in other countries such as the United States of America, several states have declared emergencies, focal biocontainment territories have been placed on lockdown, and cases are being reported to increase at an alarming rate. 2 The rapid increase is owed to the fact that more widespread testing is now slowly becoming available; however, this virus uniquely is more efficient in its rate of transmissibility, with an individual capable of spreading to 1 to 3 others. 3 The presentation of illness mimics that of a flu-like illness with fever and respiratory symptoms as common presenting complaints, and bilateral patchy infiltration is typically noted on computed tomography (CT) scans. 4 Most COVID-19 cases (87%) occur between 30 and 79 years of age, and most (81%) are mild. The remaining 14% present with severe symptoms, whereas 5% require care in an intensive care unit. 5 The case-fatality rate has been touted to be 2.3% overall (although this is likely overestimated because of the lack of widespread testing); however, death rates climb in those aged \u226580 years (15%) and in nearly half of those requiring critical care. 5 Those with cancer receiving chemotherapy as well as patients with multiple comorbidities are distinctively at a higher risk for severe illness. 5, 6 However, information on the predilection, presentation, and prognosis of COVID-19 in solid organ transplantation is sparse and has not been adequately reported.",

The second patient presented with a fever and mild CT scan findings (this being the screening modality used in China), with resolution in a few days. The laboratory findings mirrored those observed in non-transplant patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels and lymphopenia. The treatment for the patient with severe disease included withholding baseline immunosuppression and treating with high-dose corticosteroids and pooled immunoglobulin infusions. A kitchen sink approach to the cases also included the use of a fluoroquinolone along with ganciclovir, but whether this therapy was useful cannot be determined by this limited reporting. Crucially, the patient recovered to discharge without incurring immunologic consequences on the cardiac allograft and remained rejection-free.",

The novel coronavirus achieves its anchoring to the lung by using the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. The pulmonary renin\u2212angiotensin \u2212aldosterone system via ACE-2 has been implicated in prevention of lung inflammation. 8 When this system is overpowered by SARS-CoV-2, pulmonary inflammatory infiltrates emerge expressing the COVID-19 disease phenotype. It is unknown if heart transplant recipients have differential expression of pulmonary ACE-2 because a lower expression may result in less severe illness. Similarly, the anti-inflammatory effects of immunosuppression could diminish the clinical expression of the disease as well. These speculative assumptions will require structured studies to enhance our understanding of this disease pathway and processes.",

These recommendations extend to their care providers as well.",

The reason is that the novel coronavirus belongs to the Betacoronavirus family, which also contains SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome\u2212CoV. 12 Hyperimmune globulin that contains targeted antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, derived from the plasma of recovered individuals and thus capable of providing passive immunity, may also be therapeutic. 14 Ultimately, control of this outbreak will require the development of a vaccine.",
