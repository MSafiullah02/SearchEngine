As part of a strategy to discover lead molecules for an ACE2 inhibitor program, a directed screen of ACE2 versus a set of metalloprotease inhibitors from the GlaxoSmithKline compound collection was performed. Surprisingly, although confirming that classical ACE inhibitors like captopril were inactive in the screen, the thiol acid 1a was identified as a potent ACE2 inhibitor (K\ni App\n = 86 nM).15 This biphenyl analog 1a is a known dual ACE and M13 metalloprotease neutral endopeptidase (neprilysin, NEP, EC 3.4.24.11) inhibitor (ACE K\ni App\n = 30 nM, NEP K\ni App\n = 1.1 nM).16 It also inhibits the M14 metalloprotease carboxypeptidase A1 (CpA, EC 3.4.17.1, K\ni App\n = 1,200 nM). Speculating that the thiol functioned as a binding group for the active site zinc and that the carboxylic acid served as a recognition element for the enzyme\u2019s monocarboxypeptidase activity, the benzyl and methylene p-biphenyl moieties were surmised to be the P1 and P1\u2032 substituents. With this premise, the structure activity relationships of the P1 position of the lead inhibitor were explored with the goal of improving potency and reducing ACE and NEP inhibitory activity.\n",

The S1 subsite of NEP is more accepting of \u03b1-branching in P1 substituents than the ACE enzyme, but less liberal than ACE2. The \u03b1-branched iso-propyl 1h (K\ni App\n = 13 nM), (R)-sec-butyl 1i (K\ni App\n = 27 nM), (S)-sec-butyl 1j (K\ni App\n = 2.4 nM), cyclobutyl 1k (K\ni App\n = 5.4 nM), cyclopentyl 1l (K\ni App\n = 38 nM), cyclohexyl 1m (K\ni App\n = 1300 nM), and phenyl 1n (K\ni App\n = 410 nM) analogs lost some inhibitory activity versus NEP relative to the ethyl analog 1f (K\ni App\n = 0.80 nM). Thus, \u03b1-branching at the P1 group enhanced selectivity for ACE2 protease inhibition relative to ACE and NEP. The (R)-sec-butyl analog 1i (K\ni App\n = 1.5 nM) has 330-fold selectivity versus ACE and 18-fold selectivity versus NEP, while the cyclopentyl 1l (K\ni App\n = 1.8 nM) has 390-fold selectivity versus ACE and 21-fold selectivity versus NEP.",

Thus, the iso-butyl 1o analog is not only a potent ACE2 inhibitor (K\ni App\n = 1.4 nM), but also a low nanomolar ACE (K\ni App\n = 3.2 nM) and subnanomolar NEP inhibitor (K\ni App\n = 0.28 nM). ACE is less tolerant of bulky \u03b2-branching, with the neo-pentyl 1p analog exhibiting potent dual ACE2 (K\ni App\n = 7.1 nM) and NEP (K\ni App\n = 2.6 nM) inhibition with good selectivity over ACE (K\ni App\n = 2700 nM). Larger \u03b2-branched substituents like the methylene cyclohexyl 1q (ACE2 K\ni App\n = 420 nM, ACE K\ni App\n = 840 nM, NEP K\ni App\n = 130 nM) and methylene \u03b2-naphthyl 1r (ACE2 K\ni App\n = 550 nM, ACE K\ni App\n = 210 nM, NEP K\ni App\n = 140 nM) attenuate inhibitory activity at all three enzymes.

It provides insight into the SAR of the thiol series. In addition to binding to the imidazole nitrogens of 374His and 378His and the carboxylate of 402Glu, the active site zinc coordinates the thiol of the inhibitor. Also, the terminal carboxylate of the inhibitor forms electrostatic interactions with the guanidine of 273Arg and accepts hydrogen bonds from the imidazoles of 345His and 505His. Moreover, the carbonyl of 346Pro accepts a hydrogen bond from the amide nitrogen of the inhibitor, while the amide carbonyl is stabilized by a hydrogen bond to 515Tyr. Furthermore, the P1\u2032 methylene biphenyl substituent of 1i forms significant lipophilic interactions with the quite large S1\u2032 channel composed of the lengthwise canal between the two subdomains, including residues 274Phe, 276Thr, 346Pro, 367Asp, 370Leu, 371Thr, and 374His. This biphenyl substituent is hypothesized to occupy a different part of this large pocket than the carboxyl inhibitor co-crystallized in 1R4L. The P1 (R)-sec-butyl group of the inhibitor forms van der Waals interactions with the S1 pocket composed of 347Thr, 504Phe, 510Tyr, and 514Arg. As shown in the close-up of the S1 subsite depicted in Figure 2\n, 510Tyr forms part of a pocket which the \u03b1-branched methyl of the P1 (R)-sec-butyl group occupies. Larger substituents are disfavored as they would require movement of the phenol side chain of 510Tyr. Thus, this model agrees with the SAR, since the S1 subsite can tolerate cyclobutyl and cyclopentyl substituents, but is less accepting of a cyclohexyl group.",

From the model, it is apparent that the methyl group of the (R)-sec-butyl P1 moiety of inhibitor 1i bumps into the enzyme, helping explain the 330-fold selectivity for ACE2 versus ACE. The branching nature of 518Val (atom CG1) makes this portion of the S1 pocket smaller than in ACE2. 518Val is the homologous residue in ACE to 510Tyr in ACE2. This 510Tyr to 518Val substitution from ACE2 to ACE and resulting alteration of the S1 pocket volume helps explain the reduced ability of ACE to accommodate \u03b1-branching in P1 substituents.",

Information gained from these studies has proven to be useful in the design of other ACE2 inhibitors. These inhibitors will be reported in due course. Furthermore, a potent pan ACE/ACE2/NEP inhibitor 1o and a potent dual ACE2/NEP inhibitor 1p have been identified.
