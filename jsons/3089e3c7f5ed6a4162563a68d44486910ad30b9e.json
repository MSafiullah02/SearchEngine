There are several different philosophies regarding how best to achieve optimal flow patterns in the cabin.

Additionally, contamination on the floor will be carried up into the faces of the passengers. Another major factor in the difficulty of designing bottom up flow designs is the effect that the cabin furnishings may have on the flow patterns. In top down flow designs the outlet is positioned to leave the flow free from disruption by the overhead storage compartments. The seats and seat-back tables only influence the flow once it is distributed and therefore low momentum. With a \"floor up\" flow, the air flow will be disturbed before reaching the heads of the sitting or walking passengers and crew.

During flight this water freezes, but during descent and ground phases this ice defrosts leading to phenomenon such as \"rain in the plane\" where drops of water may fall into the cabin through gaps around the ceiling panels. As well as having an impact on the airline's image, this free water contributes to electrical faults, particularly as more electronic systems are introduced into the cabin for IFE and other cabin comfort systems. This effect may be seen on aircraft with high density seating layouts combined with high load factors and short turn around times (giving the aircraft less time to dry out). Drying systems, which blow dry air into the ceiling area, are becoming increasingly available and their use to combat the condensation effects of high density layouts and active humidification systems is likely to expand.",

To cool the cabin the air conditioning pack air outflow must be cooler than the outside air, which in hot and humid external conditions may lead to free water in the distribution ducting. To prevent condensation, or even icing, in the distribution network, water is removed from the air stream before being cooled in the pack. This is achieved by the introduction of a water extractor in the air conditioning packs before the air passes through the final cooling loop. An energy saving measure may also be obtained by re-injecting this water in to the ram air flow (ram air is used to provide the heat sink for the heat exchangers), which through evaporative cooling further reduces the ram air temperature, leading to increased heat exchanger efficiency. The humidified ram air does not enter the air conditioning pack air stream and is exhausted overboard.",

To fulfil this requirement the ventilation flow must be sufficient to remove the heat load in the cabin generated by the occupants, IFE and cabin operations such as food preparation. Heat load dissipation is the main driver for the setting of the ventilation flow rate. A minimum ventilation flow is required to maintain a sufficient level of pressurisation of the cabin at flight altitudes as well as for contaminant dilution. However gaseous contaminant removal can be achieved with relatively low outside air flow rates [11, 12] of around 5 cfm.

The recirculated air increases the temperature of the pack air towards the lowest temperature demand among the cabin temperature control zones. Where warmer air is required, trim air, drawn from the bleed supply upstream of the air conditioning packs, is added in the individual distribution ducts. An additional benefit of adding recirculation air is a reduced requirement for bleed air, therefore less bleed air is drawn off from the engines leading to better engine efficiency and reduced fuel burn. This helps reduce engine emissions in the atmosphere and therefore offers an environmental benefit.",

These contaminants do not enter the cabin air under normal operating and through specific design measures ingress following failure conditions is also minimised. Precautions are taken to prevent hydraulic liquid and fuel entering the air system; for instance ensuring air conditioning ducts are placed above the hydraulic fluid lines in the aircraft. APU oil seal leakages are extremely rare and engine oil seal leakages even more rare. Oil and lubricant ingestion into the bleed system from spillages during servicing is also a rare event and recommendations for correct servicing practices are provided in aircraft maintenance manuals. As SVOCs are conjectured to be present only after a very unlikely incident, and highly infrequently, no reliable data has been collected on the possible types and concentrations that could be expected.",

Depending on season and latitude, pockets of ozone may occur at lower altitudes, including altitudes at which commercial aircraft fly. The ozone concentration is generally higher at northern latitudes during the winter and spring months [21] . Ozone is highly toxic for humans and the regulatory authorities have set the maximum allowable concentrations within the cabin and cockpit as follows [1, 2]: Measurement of ozone during in-flight surveys have returned results showing ozone remains within the certified limits set down above [6] , although lack of data has been highlighted as a concern [3] . The outside ozone concentration may reach 1 ppm for a short time at cruise altitudes. Ozone is unstable and its decomposition is accelerated by heat (for instance, in the bleed system) and contact with metallic surfaces and components within the cabin itself. However, this natural breakdown process is not sufficient for such elevated outside concentrations. Ozone converters are therefore required for aircraft flying routes that pass through latitudes where high levels of ozone are expected. These routes cover almost all city pairs being bounded through northern flight paths (north Atlantic, north Pacific) and therefore most long-range aircraft are equipped with ozone converters. Ozone converters are also offered as optional equipment by Airbus for their shorter range aircraft types.",

There is a general misconception that bacteria and viruses are propagated through the ECS. Several studies have now shown that the mechanism of transmission is proximity and person-to-person contact. Both the WHO tuberculosis study [22] and the CDC led study of possible airline transmission of SARS [23] indicate that proximity, specifically in the few rows in front of the index case, is a major factor in the transmission of these diseases. In the case of the tuberculosis study, exposure time was also found to have played a significant part, with no transmission occurring on flights with duration under eight hours. These studies confirm the position of the aircraft manufacturers that micro-organisms are not spread through the ECS.",

Some studies [24] have taken a sideways look at the question of infection rates although they do not address transmission methods and thus do not allow conclusions to be drawn with respect to the amount of viral material in an aircraft cabin at any given time.

It was also determined that there was a proportional increase in the germ concentration as the passenger density increased. Thus the highest concentrations were found in the economy class section of the aircraft measured. On the other hand, the germ concentrations in the in-coming ventilation air was so low that it would fulfil requirements for operating theatres (Airbus A340) or intensive care wards (Airbus A310). When peak concentrations of bacteria occurred, for instance following a sneeze or a cough in the vicinity of the measurement equipment, the concentrations reduced rapidly to the background level. This indicated the efficacy of the aircraft ventilation system. The Institute for Hygiene and Environmental Medicine of the Medical University of L\u00fcbeck provided expert evidence that bacteria of the type and concentration found are irrelevant for health considerations and confirmed that in their view the only actual health risk is in person-to-person contact. The infection is transmitted over short distances as droplets after a sneeze or cough.",

Other factors such as the perception of space, fear of flying, the colour and light perception also have a significant influence on the overall comfort perception, however, communication of these feelings and perceptions may be difficult for the occupants themselves.
