The diagnosis was established using a standardized questionnaire or by review of in-patient hospital records. Results: We identified 76 patients (55 with relapsing MS of which 9 had pediatric-onset;17 with progressive MS; and 4 with related disorders). 37 underwent PCR testing and were confirmed positive. Of the entire group, 64 (84%) patients were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) including anti-CD20 therapies (n=34, 44.7%) and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators (n=10, 13.5%). The most common COVID-19 symptoms were fever and cough, but 21.1% of patients had neurologic symptom recrudescence preceding or coinciding with the infection. A total of 18 (23.7%) were hospitalized; 8 (10.5%) had COVID-19 critical illness or related death. Features more common among those hospitalized or with critical illness or death were older age, presence of comorbidities, progressive disease, and a non-ambulatory status. No DMT class was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or fatal outcome. Conclusions: Most MS patients with COVID-19 do not require hospitalization despite being on DMTs. Factors associated with critical illness were similar to the general 'at risk' patient population. DMT use did not emerge as a predictor of poor COVID-19 outcome in this preliminary sample.",

DMT medications have immunosuppressive effects that could hamper mounting an effective immune response to the infection. 1 On the other hand, immunosuppression could offer protection by downregulating hyperinflammation and the cytokine storm associated with severe disease. 2 New York City emerged as the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in March 2020. Given the widespread prevalence of COVID-19 in our community, clinicians at the NYU Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center (MSCCC) received numerous reports of COVID-19 infection from patients and began systematically collecting symptom data and the clinical course. This timely, real-world observational study on outcomes of COVID-19 in actively treated MS patients could inform clinicians as they counsel MS patients and guide treatment decisions during the pandemic.",

This observation can be an artifact of data collection (such patients are more likely to have regular visits during this period) or might represent an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, as has been noted with psoriasis patients on other biologic therapies 9 and non-COVID-19 infections in MS patients on anti-CD20 therapies in general. 1 As a note of caution in the care of MS patients, a subgroup of individuals reported worsening of preexisting neurologic symptoms before or at onset of COVID-19 symptoms.
