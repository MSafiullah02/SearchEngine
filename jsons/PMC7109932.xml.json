            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus (CoV) known as \u201cSARS-associated CoV\u201d (SARS-CoV) [1]. Although the first SARS epidemic (2002\u20132003) was brought under control, reemergence of the disease from infected animals or from laboratories handling SARS-CoV has already been documented on several occasions [2, 3]. Although many studies have addressed the short-term humoral response to SARS-CoV [4, 5], no studies have provided detailed information beyond 1 year of follow-up. However, on the basis of findings for other human coronavirus (OC43 and 229E) infections, it is known that immune protection is not long-lasting [6\u20138]. Therefore, it is important to study the long-term immune response of patients with SARS, to determine whether protection would potentially last for several years. This would have important practical implications for (1) hospital staff who might have had SARS in the past and who would again be exposed in the event of reemergence of the disease, and (2) optimization of the vaccines under development to provide long-term immunity. The current report presents the results from a 2-year cohort study of the humoral immune response of patients with previous cases of SARS",

This whole-virus lysate-based kit was the first kit approved by the China Food and Drug Administration for the detection of SARS-CoV antibody in China, and it has been widely used in previous studies [5, 11]. In brief, 100 \u03bcL of serially diluted serum (2-fold dilutions, beginning with an initial dilution of 1:10) was added to wells coated with SARS-CoV antigens. The plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and then was washed 5 times with washing buffer. A total of 100 \u03bcL of diluted enzyme-labeled anti\u2013human IgG was added to each well, and the plate was then incubated for an additional 30 min, followed by washing performed as described above. Next, 100 \u03bcL of tetramethylbenzidine substrate was added, and the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by adding hydrochloric acid, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured. A cutoff OD value of 0.18 was calculated as the mean +2 SDs of the OD values for control serum samples obtained from 1000 donors. The maximum dilution of a serum sample for which the OD was >0.18 was considered to be the antibody titer. For the whole process, internal positive and negative controls were included on each plate. All serum samples obtained from individual patients were analyzed on the same ELISA plate",

            "text": "A major concern regarding the reemergence of SARS is the duration and quality of natural immunity after infection, which may influence both the risk to hospital staff on reexposure to the virus and the strategies for vaccine development. Primary experiments involving mice found that NAb titers in serum samples were sufficient to protect against challenge with live SARS-CoV [14], and a recent study indicated that IgG antibodies in the serum samples of patients who had recovered from SARS played a major role in neutralizing SARS-CoV in vitro [5]. These findings suggest that both specific IgG antibodies and NAbs are important to protect hosts from reinfection, often in combination with cellular immunity [15]. The present study adds to this existing knowledge by focusing on the dynamic changes in the serum levels of IgG antibodies and NAbs in convalescent patients with SARS for up to 2 years after infection. Not all samples could be analyzed for NAbs, because of both the time-consuming nature of the experiment and the need to work in a biosafety level 3 laboratory because of safety concerns. However, by systematic analysis of all samples available at months 4, 7, and 24 after the onset of disease, it was possible to show that the dynamics of IgG antibodies and NAbs were similar, with peak titers measured at month 4 and a dramatic decrease in titers noted at month 24. All samples tested were positive for NAbs throughout follow-up, including at month 24; this finding is reassuring in terms of protection against reinfection. Of the serum samples that originally had positive results of ELISA detection for IgG antibodies, few samples (11.8%) were negative for IgG antibodies at month 24, indicating that population-based surveys of past exposure to the virus may fail to detect antibodies among some subjects who were infected more than 2 years ago",

The antibody levels of men decreased significantly faster than did those of women. Although this could be a chance finding, because 5 different factors were tested in the model, the level of significance of the association between NAb titers and sex at month 24 was P<.001, giving some credibility to the finding. Other factors known for their immunomodulatory role, such as steroids, did not influence the level of the humoral immune response",

Prolonged follow-up of NAb titers in the same cohort for >2 years is required to assess whether humoral immunity will eventually vanish",
