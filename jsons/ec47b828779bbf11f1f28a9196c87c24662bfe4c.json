Several experimental trials have proven a broadening of the protection spectrum when animals are vaccinated with multiple genotypes. Nevertheless, the conditions of vaccine administration in field are so different that the generalization of experimental results is, at least, questionable. In the present study a large scale epidemiological-phylodynamic approach was used to reconstruct the demographic history of the major field genotype (i.e. the QX one) circulating in Italy and Spain. These two countries were selected because, even if they share a comparable epidemiological scenario, the implemented vaccination protocols did not vary in Spain while changed dramatically in Italy over the time period considered. One hundred and ninety-five Italian and 98 Spanish non-recombinant sequences of the hyper-variable region of the S1 gene obtained between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed using a serial coalescent-based approach to reconstruct viral population history over time. While the IBV QX population dynamics remained constant in Spain, a much more complex pattern was evidenced in Italy; both in terms of viral population size and clinical outbreak frequency. Remarkably, a strong association with changes in vaccination strategies was recognized. This allowed demonstrating, by accomplishing all Hill's criteria for causation, the cause-effect relationship between the vaccine administration/withdrawal and the variation in viral population dynamics and, above all, IBV related outbreaks. Thus, a robust confirmation about the efficacy of IBV vaccination in field conditions was provided. Additionally, the history herein reported testifies the primary importance of rigorously planning not only the intervention strategies but also their monitoring and evaluation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) represents one of the most relevant infectious diseases of poultry, causing severe economic losses mainly associated to respiratory and reproductive syndromes, decreased productive performances and increased mortality. Even if biosecurity and good management practices are fundamental in the disease containment, widespread vaccination is also essential to control the disease. Like other coronaviruses and ssRNA+ viruses, IBV displays a high mutation and recombination rate [1, 2] . This has caused the crowding of a huge genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity and the emergence of plenty of IBV variants whose cross-protection has been proven poor [3, 4] . In Italy, IBV is still the major threat for poultry farms and displays a high prevalence and variety of circulating genotypes. Although five genotypes are currently detected (i.e. QX (72%), followed by 793B (16%), Mass (8%), Q1 (3%) and D274 (1%)) [5] , the QX genotype is by far the most commonly associated to clinical outbreaks and, in all probability, the only relevant field genotype. Despite the development of homologous vaccines was often impractical or impossible, the immunization using multiple vaccines, based on different genotypes, has been proven to be beneficial, broadening the protection spectrum (i.e. ''protectotype concept\") [6] . Consequently, vaccination schedules typically involve a combination of two genotypes, http with acertain variability among countries and/or regions. In Italy, broiler vaccination protocols conform to this theory: animals were routinely immunized with a Mass-based spray vaccine at hatchery and a 793B-based one in field via drinking water. Recently, a trend toward administration of the two vaccines at 1 day of life has been observed. However, the costs associated with the vaccination as well as the risk of rolling-reactions, have persuaded many companies to suspend or modify vaccination protocols against IBV. In a recent study, we demonstrated that such change had a noteworthy impact on IBV genotypes circulation in Italy, leading to the substantial disappearance of the 793B genotype, suggesting that its presence was due to the spreading of vaccine strains or vaccinerelated ones [5] . However, the effects of this strategy on field strain epidemiology and clinical outbreak frequency has been never evaluated in detail. Despite experimental trials demonstrated that the Mass vaccination is not protective against a QX challenge when administered alone while it is effective in combination with a 793B vaccine strain [7] , their generalization to field conditions is often hazardous due to the extreme differences between the two settings. On the other hand, the collection of the huge amount of data necessary for rigorous large-scale field studies is often impossible due to economical and practical constraints. The development of a theoretical framework and mathematical models to reconstruct evolutionary features and population history of rapidly evolving viruses offers a great opportunity to reconcile and investigate viral epidemiology and evolution [8] [9] [10] [11] , an approach that has been proven effective for the study of many human [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] and animal [17] [18] [19] [20] diseases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 509, "end": 512, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 513, "end": 515, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 682, "end": 685, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 686, "end": 688, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 939, "end": 942, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1340, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1433, "text": "http", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2232, "end": 2235, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2569, "end": 2572, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3111, "end": 3114, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3115, "end": 3118, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3119, "end": 3123, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3124, "end": 3128, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3202, "end": 3206, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3207, "end": 3211, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3212, "end": 3216, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3217, "end": 3221, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3222, "end": 3226, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3238, "end": 3242, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3243, "end": 3247, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3248, "end": 3252, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3253, "end": 3257, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In the present study, we set up a systematic analysis of the effect that the stopping and re-introduction of IBV vaccination with the 793B genotype had on the population dynamics of the QX genotype in Italy and on the occurrence of episodes of overt disease.

Accordingly, and differently from Italy, the IBV QX population dynamics remained constant during the whole study period, already suggesting that, despite not being able to eradicate the pathogen, this strategy was effective in controlling it in field conditions. Nevertheless, it should be also noted that comparison between independent populations could be biased by unconsidered confounding factors and the results should be compared with caution.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "On the other hand, the particular scenario occurred in Italy allowed to test this hypothesis by comparing, at different time points, the same viral population in different condition of vaccine exposure (i.e. exposed, non-exposed). It seems clear that vaccination with Mass plus 793B genotypes was able to at least partially control QX spread during the first epidemiological phase, confirming the experimental evidences. While the persistence of a viral shedding was reported also under experimental conditions, the report of a certain frequency of clinical outbreaks in vaccinated flocks clashes with the absence of clinical signs reported by Terregino et al., (2008) . Nevertheless, it is well known that vaccine administration is often sub-optimal in field conditions and the presence of several co-factors can easily explain the partial protection induced by these vaccination strategies. After vaccination via drinking water with the 793B genotype was suspended in spring 2013, the epidemiological situation remained substantially stable for almost a year. The transitory decrease in relative genetic diversity, which occurred between December 2013 and June 2014 (Fig. 1) , mirrors the implementation of a large-scale trial with a newly registered 793B-based vaccine. Therefore, it can be speculated that this new strategy provided a higher protection against the circulating strains. Nevertheless, the companies decided to stop the trial because the reduction in the number of outbreaks was considered unsatisfactory. This decision was followed by a dramatic increase in viral population size, which preceded in about 2-3 months a peak in the number of clinical outbreaks (Fig. 2) . This evidence is quite expected since the sole Mass vaccine was already reported to be ineffective against QX challenge [36] . The delay between the change in viral population and clinical manifestation is probably ascribable to the need of reaching an adequate infectious pressure plus the disease incubation time, a hypothesis that could also be adduced to explain the apparent limited practical effect of the introduction of the new 793B vaccine. In fact, it is possible to speculate that a relatively low viral burden can be tolerated without evident clinical problems thus limiting the benefits of a further reduction. Nevertheless, the economical impact of sub-clinical infections, demonstrated for several livestock diseases [37] [38] [39] 3, 35] , was not accounted in the present study. The inverse relationship between relative genetic diversity as well as vaccination period and the age of outbreaks occurrence (Fig. 3) further supports this hypothesis. The higher and long lasting protection induced by double vaccination protocols can have both increased the individual resistance to infection and decreased the infectious pressure (of which the relative genetic diversity can be considered as a proxy) leading to a delayed disease outbreaks. More challenging is to explain the long latency observed between vaccination withdrawal and epidemiological changes. Other concomitant and unconsidered changes like co-infection, climate changes or other managerial choices, etc. could have also played a role and will deserve further investigation.

(IV) Theoretical Plausibility. It is easier to accept an association as causal when there is a theoretical basis for such a conclusion. (V) Coherence. The association must be coherent with other knowledge. (VI) Specificity in the causes. In the ideal situation, the effect has only one cause. (VII) Dose Response Relationship. There should be a relationship between the risk factor exposure and the disease. (VIII) Experimental Evidence. Related researches based on experiments support a causal inference. (IX) Analogy.

The vaccination trial performed between December 2013 and June 2014, affecting only a limited portion of the poultry flocks, caused a less marked decrease in viral population size compared with the outstanding one experienced after November 2015, when the whole poultry population was massively vaccinated.
