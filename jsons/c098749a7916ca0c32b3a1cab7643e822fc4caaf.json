This unprecedented situation is posing an enormous burden on the healthcare systems worldwide and is reshaping the way in which chronic disorders are managed. The current governmental measures of lockdown, social distancing, and self-isolation aimed at slowing the spread of the viral infection, minimizing contacts between potentially infected individuals and healthy subjects. However, they can complicate the management of patients with neurological chronic diseases by causing or worsening concomitant anxiety and depression, hampering the contacts with physicians, and leading to shortages or erratic supply of medicines.",

Although current antiseizure medications can effectively control seizures in the majority of patients, one-third of them continue experiencing seizures (drug-resistant epilepsy). Regular outpatient consultations are therefore important for optimizing antiseizure therapy, managing epilepsy-related behavioral or psychological problems, treating concomitant neurological disorders, conveying psychological support, counseling on family planning, and releasing certifications for driving license or fitness for work. All these activities can be severely hampered by the containment measures established to face the pandemic. The rearrangement of the healthcare systems has inevitably prioritized the management of patients with COVID-19 infection, reducing the hospital access of patients with other chronic disorders (including those with epilepsy), postponing, rescheduling, or even canceling appointments and examinations. Furthermore, the industrial lockdown can lead to reduced supplies of antiseizure medications.",

Patients or caregivers with cognitive impairment, limited education, or low economic resources can hence find it difficult to easily and effectively access this technology.
