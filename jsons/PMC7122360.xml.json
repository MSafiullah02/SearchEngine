The shell membrane lies immediately beneath the shell; this is a tough fibrinous membrane that forms the air sac in the blunt end of the egg. In contrast to the shell membrane, chorioallantoic, amniotic, and yolk membranes comprise largely epithelium and represent potential sites of coronaviral replication. The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) lies directly beneath the shell membrane; this is a highly vascular membrane that serves as the respiratory organ of the embryo. The CAM is the largest of the embryo membranes, and it encloses the largest cavity within the egg, the allantoic cavity; in the embryonated chicken egg, this cavity contains approximately 5\u201310 ml of fluid, depending upon the stage of embryonation. The amniotic membrane encloses the embryo and forms the amniotic cavity; in the embryonated chicken egg, this cavity contains approximately 1 ml of fluid. The yolk sac is attached to the embryo and contains the nutrients the embryo utilizes during development.",

Embryonated eggs may be inoculated by depositing virus directly onto the CAM, or by depositing virus within allantoic, amniotic, and yolk sacs ((6). For group 3 coronaviruses, inoculation of eggs by allantoic or amniotic routes has been shown to provide these viruses with access to specific cell types that support their replication ((2\u2013 4). IBV replicates in a variety of epithelial surfaces of the chicken including the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and oviduct ((7). In the embryonated chicken egg, IBV replicates well regardless of inoculation route; however, the allantoic route is favored as the virus replicates extensively in epithelium of the CAM and high titers are shed into allantoic fluid ((8). A pheasant coronavirus has been isolated and propagated in embryonated chicken eggs using procedures similar to those utilized for IBV (allantoic route inoculation) ((3). In contrast, TCoV is an enterotropic virus that replicates only in intestinal epithelium and bursa of Fabricius of chickens and turkeys ((1,4,9). The enterotropic nature of TCoV is also observed in the embryonated egg; the virus replicates only in embryonic intestines and bursa of Fabricius, sites that are reached only via amniotic inoculation.\n",

Filtration of samples will reduce virus titer, and should be used only when necessary.The accuracy of delivering an inoculum into the amniotic sac using this method may be checked by injecting a dye such as crystal violet (0.2% crystal violet in 95% ethanol), then opening the eggs and determining the site of dye deposition.The principal disadvantage of method B is the difficulty of visualizing the embryo, particularly in embryonated eggs having a dark shell color (e.g., turkey eggs, brown chicken eggs).Embryo deaths that occur less than 24 h after inoculation are generally due to bacterial contamination, toxicity of the inoculum, or injury.Refrigeration kills the embryo and causes the blood to clot. This prevents contamination of allantoic fluid with blood.Multiple passages in embryonated eggs may be necessary for initial isolation of coronaviruses; allantoic fluid is used as inoculum for passages. Embryos at each passage should be evaluated for gross lesions. For IBV, embryo-lethal strains generally result in embryos with cutaneous hemorrhage; non-embryo-lethal strains result in stunting, curling, clubbing of down, or urate deposits in the mesonephros of the kidney. Virus replication in embryonated eggs may not be associated with readily detectable embryo lesions.TCoV rarely results in embryo mortality; for this virus only those eggs with live embryos following the specified incubation period are examined. The possibility of embryo-lethal viruses should not be overlooked.The method of euthanasia employed will depend upon the method used to detect virus in inoculated embryos. Fresh tissues are required if immunohistochemistry is to be employed; for this, embryos should be euthanized by cervical dislocation or exposed briefly to carbon dioxide gas.\n",
