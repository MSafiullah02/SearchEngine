As part of this trend, the adaptation of Information Retrieval (IR) approaches to recommend people to connect to in the network have been particularly studied [17, 34]. This specific class of recommender systems has the interesting property that users play a dual role: they are the users to whom we want to provide recommendations, but they are also the items we want to recommend [32]. Recently, it has been shown that classical IR weighting models \u2013 such as BM25 \u2013 can not only be used, but are also effective and efficient for the contact recommendation task [34].",

Content-based recommender systems [2] have been the most direct realization of such ties.

We start our analysis by examining contact recommendation methods that directly adapt IR models [34], as they provide a bridge between existing work on axiomatic analysis in IR models, and this new task. In particular, we empirically analyze whether satisfying the IR axioms leads to an increase in the performances of the algorithms. Interestingly, we find that while this is generally true, the axioms related to length normalization negatively impact the contact recommendation performance, since they interfere with a key evolutionary principle in social networks, namely preferential attachment [8].",

[12] proposed several heuristics (known as axioms) addressing different properties of the models such as the frequency of the query terms in the retrieved documents, the relative discrimination between query terms, or how a model deals with long documents. They also analyzed the effect such properties had on the effectiveness of state-of-the-art models such as BM25 [29] or query likelihood [27], and found that, with minor modifications to adhere to the different proposed axioms, the modified IR models achieved an improved retrieval performance.",

[28] proposed a method for empirically checking if the learned neural models fulfil the different IR axioms, while Rosset et al. [30] used the axioms as constraints for guiding the training of neural models. Beyond IR, axiomatic analysis has also expanded to other areas such as recommender systems, where Valcarce et al.

We show the results in Fig. 1(a), where each dot represents a different approach. In the x axis, we show the nDCG@10 value for the unweighted approaches, whereas the y axis shows nDCG@10 for the weighted ones.

To analyze this, we compare the MCN approach (which satisfies the constraint) with a binarized version of MCN which returns all people at distance 2 regardless of the common neighbor count. Restricting the test set to people at distance 2, Table 5 shows the resulting AUC [15] of the MCN algorithm, averaged over users on each network. Under these conditions, the binarized version would have an AUC value of 0.5. Hence, our results show that the number of common neighbors seem to be a strong signal for providing accurate recommendations (and, therefore, EWC3 seems to be important on its own for the contact recommendation task).",

Theoretically, we have translated the different axioms proposed in [13] to the contact recommendation task, and we have checked whether the mapping introduced in [34] is sound and complete. We have found that, in general, the properties of the IR models are held in the recommendation task when we apply this mapping, unless we use a different definition for the document length from the usual. Empirically, we have conducted several experiments over various Twitter and Facebook networks to check if those axioms have any positive effect on the accuracy of the recommenders. We showed that satisfying the constraints related to term frequencies and term discrimination have a positive impact on the accuracy. However, those related to length normalization tend to have the opposite effect, as they interfere with a basic evolutionary principle of social networks, namely preferential attachment [8].",
