            "text": "We analyze two alterations of the standard susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) dynamics that preserve the central properties of spontaneous healing and infection capacity of a vertex increasing unlimitedly with its degree. All models have the same epidemic thresholds in mean-field theories but depending on the network properties, simulations yield a dual scenario, in which the epidemic thresholds of the modified SIS models can be either dramatically altered or remain unchanged in comparison with the standard dynamics. For uncorrelated synthetic networks having a power-law degree distribution with exponent \u03b3 < 5/2, the SIS dynamics are robust exhibiting essentially the same outcomes for all investigated models. A threshold in better agreement with the heterogeneous rather than quenched mean-field theory is observed in the modified dynamics for exponent \u03b3 > 5/2. Differences are more remarkable for \u03b3 > 3, where a finite threshold is found in the modified models in contrast with the vanishing threshold of the original one. This duality is elucidated in terms of epidemic lifespan on star graphs. We verify that the activation of the modified SIS models is triggered in the innermost component of the network given by a k-core decomposition for \u03b3 < 3 while it happens only for \u03b3 < 5/2 in the standard model. For \u03b3 > 3, the activation in the modified dynamics is collective involving essentially the whole network while it is triggered by hubs in the standard SIS. The duality also appears in the finite-size scaling of the critical quantities where mean-field behaviors are observed for the modified but not for the original dynamics. Our results feed the discussions about the most proper conceptions of epidemic models to describe real systems and the choices of the most suitable theoretical approaches to deal with these models.",

Infected individuals become spontaneously healed (susceptible) with rate \u03bc and transmit the disease to their susceptible contacts with rate \u03bb. In principle, the SIS dynamics can exhibit a phase transition between a disease-free (absorbing) state and an active stationary phase, in which the epidemics persists in an endemic state. The transition occurs at an epidemic threshold \u03bb c . However, for uncorrelated random networks with a power-law degree distribution P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 , it was rigorously proved [5] and later put in sound physical grounds [11] that the absorbing phase is unstable in the thermodynamic limit implying that the epidemic threshold is formally zero.",

            "text": "Considering that both real and computationally generated networks are finite, the finite-size dependence of the epidemic variables is a fundamental issue. Analytically, it is frequently accessed by mean-field approximations that take into account the network heterogeneity but truncate at some level the dynamical correlations [8] . Two classes of mean-field theories are mostly used. The degree-based theory [20, 21] , termed as heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) [1, 3] , is a coarse-grained mixing approach, in which the vertex degree is the relevant quantity. This method is closely related to the annealed network regime where the connections are rewired in time scales much shorter than those of the dynamical processes taking place on the top of the network [4, 22] . The individual-based theory [23] [24] [25] , termed quenched mean-field (QMF) [7] , considers the network structure without mixing using its adjacency matrix [1] . These theories predict equivalent epidemic thresholds of the SIS dynamics on uncorrelated random networks with power-law degree distribution of exponent 2 < \u03b3 < 5/2 but are sharply conflicting for \u03b3 > 3 [7] , for which HMF predicts finite thresholds whereas QMF vanishing ones as N \u2192 \u221e. The latter is asymptotically in agreement with the exact results [5, 6] and supported by stochastic simulations [11, 26, 27] . For 5/2 < \u03b3 < 3, both theories state a null threshold as N \u2192 \u221e, but the way that the asymptotic value is approached and, thus, the effective finite-size thresholds are different. Improvements of these theories including dynamical correlations by means of pairwise approximations [8] do not change the foregoing scenarios [16, 27, 28] .",

The criterion involves the recovering time \u03c4 k of an epidemics on a star graph, consisting of a central vertex connected to k leaves of degree 1 that mimics the hubs of a network, and the time \u03c4 (inf) that the hubs take to mutually transmit the infection to each other. If \u03c4 k \u03c4 (inf) , hubs remain active for times sufficiently long to infect each other and the epidemics is triggered by the mutual activation of hubs, leading to a vanishing threshold in the thermodynamic limit. If \u03c4 k \u03c4 (inf) , the mutual reinfection is knocked out and the transition to an endemic phase can only take place collectively involving a finite fraction of the network and happens at a finite threshold. In Ref. [12] , this criterion notably predicted that waning immunity [29] , in which infected individuals are temporarily immunized before to become susceptible, leads to a finite threshold for \u03b3 > 3 which disagrees with the prediction of QMF approximation, but in agreement with extensive numerical simulations.",

In the present work, we tackle this problem comparing slightly modified versions of the standard SIS model, preserving the spontaneous healing and infection capacity increasing proportionally to the vertex degree. All modified and original models have the same thresholds in both HMF and QMF theories. However, the criterion of mutual reinfection time of hubs [11, 12] predicts a finite threshold in the thermodynamic limit for the modified models in uncorrelated networks [30] with \u03b3 > 3, in contrast with the standard SIS. Stochastic simulations [31] on large networks corroborate this prediction. For 5/2 < \u03b3 < 3, we observed that the modified dynamics present a vanishing threshold in better agreement with HMF than QMF. For 2 < \u03b3 < 5/2, the SIS infection mechanism is robust and all models have essentially the same epidemic threshold. This duality is explained in terms of epidemic activation mechanisms [9, 12, 32] .",

First, the metastable, localized, and active states of the standard SIS dynamics necessary to sustain the endemic activity for any infection rate for \u03b3 > 3 are not universal and their realizations in real epidemic processes may be unrealistic. Second, for the widely more frequent case of networks with 2 < \u03b3 < 3, the null threshold is a robust feature, obtained irrespectively of the existence of locally self-activated star subgraphs. In such an absence, epidemics is triggered in the innermost, densely connected component of the network given by a k-core decomposition [33] , while for the original SIS model it happens only for 2 < \u03b3 < 5/2 [32] . Last but not least, the HMF theory [3, 4, 20] , which has been frequently pretermitted due to its failure in capturing the asymptotically null epidemic threshold of the standard SIS for \u03b3 > 3 [7, 23, 24] , is more accurate than the QMF theory for the present modified SIS models and also in other models as contact processes [28] and SIRS [12] . The origins of this worse performance of the QMF theory is discussed in our conclusions.",

A significant difference in the scaling happens for \u03b3 = 2.7 and a sharp difference is obtained for \u03b3 = 3.5. In the latter, we can see a susceptibility of the SIS-S bending downwardly for the quenched network, which has been associated to a smearing of the phase transition [57] , while in the annealed network a power-law typical of an ordinary critical phase transition is seen.

However, this does not seem to be always the case when the substrate carrying out the process is a complex network. The standard SIS model, called SIS-S in this work, is an example that behaves very differently from most of other related processes. For example, while many fundamental models on random networks with a power-law degree distribution (susceptible infected recovered (SIR) model [58] , Ising model [59, 60] , synchronization [61] , etc.) have a finite order parameter for any value of the control parameter only for degree exponent \u03b3 < 3 [3] , this happens for any value of \u03b3 in SIS-S [5, 7] . A dichotomy also appears in the two basic mean-field theories for SIS-S, namely, QMF and HMF, which predict different outcomes for the epidemic threshold for \u03b3 > 5/2 [7, 26] , being only QMF in agreement with the asymptotically null threshold for \u03b3 > 3.",

We investigated two slightly different versions of the standard SIS, termed SIS-A and SIS-T , in which the spontaneous healing and the unlimited infection capacity of a vertex are preserved. These alternative models present exactly the same thresholds of the SIS-S in both QMF and HMF theories. Stochastic simulations on uncorrelated synthetic networks, however, show a dual scenario where the three models have essentially the same vanishing thresholds for \u03b3 < 5/2 but disparate results are found for \u03b3 > 5/2. In particular, a finite threshold is observed for \u03b3 > 3 in both modified models, in contrast with the asymptotically null threshold of the standard case. This same framework was observed for SIRS model in Ref. [12] , in which an individual acquires temporary immunity when the agents cannot neither transmit infection nor be infected. The dissonance is explained in terms of self-sustained, long-lived activation of hubs for any finite value of \u03bb [11] that holds for SIS-S but does not for the other models. The epidemic lifespan of hubs with the modified dynamics increases slowly (algebraically or logarithmically) with the hub degree in contrast with the exponential increase of the standard case. The last one permits the long-range mutual activation or reactivation of hubs [11, 12] .",

Dynamical correlations are neglected in both approaches assuming that the states of interacting vertices, in case of QMF, or interacting compartments, in the case of HMF, are independent. This approximation becomes more problematic for QMF since we explicitly reckon the interactions with the actual nearest-neighbors of each vertex and assume that their states are independent. The leading approximation in HMF is to assume that the probability to be infected depends only on the vertex degree, neglecting the local structure of the network. As an effect, HMF theory may not be able to capture localized activity due to specific motifs as those observed for star subgraphs in the SIS-S model. Finally, QMF theory is not a genuine mean-field approach since it does not present mixing of vertices while HMF does through the degree compartmentalization. Our results thus reinforces the belief that mean-field approaches with heterogeneous mixing are suitable approximations for most dynamical processes on networks with a small-world property, in which the average distance between vertices increases logarithmically with the system size [1] .",
