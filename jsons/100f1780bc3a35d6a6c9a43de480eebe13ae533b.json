The aforementioned enzyme plays an important role on the interaction between cardiovascular diseases and COVID-19. ACE2 cleaves angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7, thus exerting more anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions than inflammatory roles. 25, 26 This enzyme might be embraced by the virus after the activation of viral surface spike (S) protein by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). 27 One of the possible mechanisms that mediates cardiovascular disease and higher severity of COVID-19 is through ACE2 pathway. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are commonly used in individuals with cardiovascular diseases. These drugs upregulate ACE2 expression which consequently facilitates COVID entry into pneumocytes and further cause exarcebation/decompensation of the underlying disease. 28 The virus downregulates ACE2 expression, limiting its organoprotective effects, and consequently causes renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) dysfunction. 25, 29 Unfortunately, the included studies did not provide information regarding the use of ACEI/ARB, thus the relationship remains inconclusive. Nevertheless, recent evidences demonstrated that cardiac damage might be due to combination of direct damage and indirect damage through cytokine storm; additionally, elevation of troponin and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) have been associated with increased mortality. 30, 31 The underlying mechanism of increased severity of COVID-19 in patients with cerebrovascular disease remains unclear. This topic is a matter of interest. One of the plausible explanation is that both cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases share the same risk factors and often overlapped, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney diseases, and diabetes may increase the risk for various cardio-cerebrovascular diseases.",

However, it should be noted that meta-regression itself has limitation for exploring the association between variables and larger cohorts might be needed. Aside from the indirect association, theoretically, presence of brain medullary cardiorespiratory or autonomic nervous system dysfunction potentially cause blood pressure and respiratory dysfunction which promotes the risk of contracting opportunistic infections (viral and bacterial). 33 Cholinergic Pathway was shown to suppresses pulmonary innate immunity, increasing the risk for bacterial pneumonia in post-stroke patients. 34 Another possible hypothesis for underlying cerebrovascular disease in increasing the risk for poor outcome in COVID-19 may be due to the relatively immobile in post-stroke patients which will increase the risk for hypercoagulable state that culminates in thrombus formation. Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection itself could induce dysfunctional haemostatic system leading to a hypercoagulable state, a condition which we commonly encounter in sepsis. 35, 36 Furthermore, a recent evidence of lung pathology in critically-ill COVID-19 patients has shown occlusion and micro-thrombosis formation in pulmonary blood vessels which would suggest pulmonary embolism might have a role in increasing the risk for poor outcome. 37 Unfortunately, all the included studies did not specify any functional and motoric status among patients with cerebrovascular disease, thus any conclusion regarding this hypothesis could not be proven nor be refuted.",

It is currently thought that SARS-CoV-2, together with host immune mechanisms, can turn these infections into persistent diseases with neurological complications, like viral encephalitis, infectious toxic encephalopathy and acute cerebrovascular disease. 41 A single-center observation showed that in 221 COVID-19 patients, 5% developed acute ischemic stroke, 0.5%, developed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and 0.5% cerebral hemorrhage; the incident was higher in older patients with risk factors. 42 The authors also stated that an increased inflammatory response and hypercoagulable state was found in patients that developed cerebrovascular events. It has been demonstrated that the risk for poor outcome was higher in patients with prolonged prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, thrombin time, and d-dimer which indicates coagulopathy that predispose patients to thrombotic events. 43 Previously, influenza has been shown to increase the risk of stroke. 46 These complications can be more severe in the presence of compromised cerebral vasculature.

Oxley et al. reported 5 cases of large-vessel stroke in young patients aged <50 years old. 45 Two of the reported patients were 33 and 37 years-old without risk factors for stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck; and echocardiographic investigation of the former showed no potential source of thrombus. This suggest that COVID-19 may cause clotting in large vessels of patients without risk factors for stroke.",
