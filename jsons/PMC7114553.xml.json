            "text": "The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus in the Coronaviridae family (Masters, 2006, Park et al., 2012). The PEDV genome is approximately 28 kb in length, with seven overlapping open reading frames encoding the replicase (ORF1a, 1b) nonstructural proteins and the accessory protein ORF3, as well as the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) structural proteins (Kocherhans et al., 2001). The S protein mediates specific receptor binding and membrane fusion to facilitate viral entry and contains major antigenic epitopes for neutralizing antibodies against PEDV (Sun et al., 2007). The E protein is a membrane protein which has been found to play a role in viral budding in other coronaviruses (Ortego et al., 2007), while the M protein plays a role in viral assembly (de Haan et al., 2000). Coronavirus N proteins bind viral RNA, providing structural scaffolding for viral transcription, replication and assembly (McBride et al., 2014). The replicase genes encompassing two-thirds of the genome (ORF1a and ORF1b) encode two polyproteins that are further processed by viral proteases into 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs 1\u201316) important for viral replication (Kocherhans et al., 2001). These proteins and ORF3 remain to be fully characterized.",

            "text": "The mechanisms behind PEDV pathogenesis remain largely unknown due to the challenges in propagating field isolates in cell culture and the lack of genetic tools for virus manipulation. Coronaviruses have genomes approximately 30 kb in length, the largest among RNA viruses, which present a significant challenge in engineering vectors for the generation of infectious clones as the distinction between natural and amplification-associated mutations and sequencing errors can be extremely difficult to pin down. In addition, attempts to set up reverse genetics systems have been hampered by the instability and toxicity of viral genomic sequences. Recently, however, a number of reverse genetics techniques have been developed for PEDV, promising to greatly accelerate research into the PEDV replication cycle and pathogenesis. The three techniques used are targeted RNA recombination, the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) system, and in vitro ligation. These approaches, along with their strengths and weaknesses, will be discussed in detail in this review, as well as a few alternative methods that have yet to be applied to PEDV. As appropriate cellular substrates are significant factors for successful virus rescue and propagation, we will also present an overview of cell lines that have been studied in the context of PEDV. We will then discuss some topics that can be further explored using reverse genetics technology, namely the role of trypsin in viral propagation, the study of receptors and attachment factors for viral entry, S protein variation and its implications, the significance of ORF3 and N proteins, and how reverse genetics may help overcome challenges in PEDV vaccine design.",

This technique was subsequently applied to reverse genetics of other coronaviruses such as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (Haijema et al., 2003) and PEDV (Li et al., 2013).

Such phenotypes have included changes in temperature sensitivity and plaque size, as pioneered by Koetzner et al. (Koetzner et al., 1992). More recently, the use of S proteins that confer a very specific change in host cell tropism has been employed for greater ease in recombinant virus selection (Kuo et al., 2000, Kuo and Masters, 2002). Overall, targeted RNA recombination takes advantage of the high rate of coronavirus RNA recombination during host cell infection (Lai et al., 1985, Liao and Lai, 1992, Makino et al., 1986) as well as strict host tropism for selection of complete recombinant viral genomes.",

A synthetic donor construct was first prepared encoding (a) the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter for RNA transcription, (b) a segment of the ORF1b sequence for targeted recombination, (c) the MHV S protein in place of the PEDV S, and (d) the remaining downstream sequences, including ORF3, E, M and N. Chimeric virus was generated by RNA recombination after electroporation of PEDV-infected Vero cells with transcribed RNA from the construct. Recombinants carrying the MHV S gene (mPEDV) were selected by propagation in murine L cells. For the next stage, a second donor construct encompassing the same genomic region was prepared. This construct carried PEDV S to enable recombinant virus selection in Vero cells, although in practice, it need not be the same S gene as the original virus. Likewise, the remaining genes (ORF3, E, M, N) may be modified and, in the case of ORF3, removed entirely or replaced with a reporter such as luciferase. Electroporation of transcribed RNA into mPEDV-infected L cells followed by selection on Vero yielded the final recombinant virus.",

Swapping of S, ORF3, E, M and/or N genes enables studies into gene product function. And as ORF3 is considered an accessory protein, recombinant PEDVs with reporters in place of ORF3 can be created with this technique, allowing tracking of recombinant virus replication and spread, as well as facilitating quantification of viral growth. Targeted RNA recombination is an elegant solution to obstacles faced in cloning the replicase genes, and remains an option if problems in infectious cDNA cloning appear insurmountable.",

Its dependence on T7 RNA polymerase transcription means that the viral genetic sequence must be carefully assessed for potential cryptic transcription termination signals, and mutations must be carefully implemented to avoid detrimental effect to the virus. Additionally, in vitro selection of the recombinant virus is contingent upon the use of an S gene that is capable of mediating entry into Vero or other known target cells. Viruses carrying mutations that destroy receptor binding or fusion cannot be generated for testing hypotheses regarding cell entry. Similarly, lethal mutations in other regions will prevent recovery of recombinant virus. And even after recombinant viruses have been successfully generated, they may need to be plaque purified and screened, especially in cases where multiple mutations or gene swaps are desired, as a single recombination event is not guaranteed (Lai, 1996). An identification marker at the far 3\u2032 end of the donor sequence can be used for selection (Koetzner et al., 1992), which would require analysis of clones by procedures such as sequencing.",

The expression cassette of this full-length clone comprises, in this order, the CMV promoter, the PEDV genomic sequence flanked by the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs, a 25-residue polyA tract, the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme cleavage site, and the bovine growth hormone termination and polyA sequence (BGH). Flanking this entire expression cassette are transcription terminator sequences, one at either end, to reduce transcription from cryptic promoters and reduce toxicity to transformed bacteria. This precaution supports the stable maintenance of viral cDNA in the pSMART-BAC system. After the cloning process, however, bacterial transposon sequences (ATGGTACCG) were found to have integrated into the genomic sequence, confounding attempts to rescue the virus.

Additionally, we observed insertion of bacterial tranposons into the viral sequence after propagation in bacteria, so regular checking of sequence fidelity at every step during clone construction is critical. This need to recheck viral sequences at each cloning step is a major bottleneck for workflow, especially after the full-length cDNA assembly stage, and having accurate, verified sequence data for the original, infectious virus as a basis for comparison is absolutely vital for cloning success.",

Six cDNA fragments spanning the entire PEDV genome were designed with flanking class II restriction endonuclease sites for seamless and specific ligation (see assembly details in Fig. 3\n). Each fragment was inserted into a subcloning vector, with the 5\u2032-most segment ligated to a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The fragments were subsequently digested, ligated, and transcribed in vitro to generate full-length RNA transcripts of the virus. Infectious RNA was subsequently electroporated into Vero cells for recovery of infectious PEDV. N gene transcripts were also prepared and electroporated along with the genomic RNA as previously done with TGEV (Yount et al., 2000), where N was shown to be critical for efficient virus replication and spread. Such N supplementation has proven to enhance rescue of other coronaviruses as well (Youn et al., 2005, Yount et al., 2003, Yount et al., 2002) but has not been needed for DNA-launched virus production systems like the BAC approach, suggesting the importance of N-mediated encapsidation of coronavirus RNA for transcription initiation.",

While assembly steps vary with each report, the cDNA is ultimately ligated at the unique NotI site of the vNotI/tk vaccinia virus DNA (Merchlinsky and Moss, 1992). Some approaches first clone incomplete segments of genomic cDNA into vaccinia (Tekes et al., 2008, van den Worm et al., 2012), although full-length insertions of the 27-kb IBV and 31-kb MHV (Coley et al., 2005) genomes have been successful. The ligation reaction is then transfected into cells infected with fowlpox helper virus, which carries the necessary machinery for initiation of transcription. Recombinant vaccinia viruses are collected, and the DNA purified and used for T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription, either by in vitro transcription (Tekes et al., 2008) or intracellularly in the presence of recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase (Casais et al., 2001, van den Worm et al., 2012). In the case of in vitro transcription, full-length coronavirus RNA will need to be electroporated back into cells to generate the final recombinant virus. While multiple steps are necessary for vaccinia vector-based reverse genetics, modifications to recombinant viruses can be achieved by homologous recombination, which, unlike the BAC and in vitro ligation systems described above, does not require reassembly of all component fragments.",

DNA fragments are designed with at least 20 overlapping bases at both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, and are ligated simultaneously in the absence of restriction digestion in a single-step, isothermic reaction. This is accomplished with three key components: (a) a 5\u2032 exonuclease to generate recessed ends, (b) DNA polymerase to fill in the gaps after annealing of sticky ends, and (c) DNA ligase. While Gibson assembly has not been applied to coronavirus infectious clone construction, it has been used to successfully recover infectious clones of viruses such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRSSV) (Suhardiman et al., 2015), dengue virus (Siridechadilok et al., 2013), and West Nile virus (Vandergaast et al., 2014). Given that it eliminates the need for restriction site design, it may prove to be a very effective tool to complement in vitro ligation as well as cloning into BAC or vaccinia vectors.",

However, beyond being simply a tool for rapid assembly of cDNA, it can also circumvent the need for bacterial transformation as demonstrated by Suhardiman et al.

By generating cDNA by RT-PCR from field samples, this approach can be extremely useful for rapid generation of viral clones that preserve viral sequence diversity. However, the complete elimination of bacteria propagation steps also prevents sequence verification and control prior to virus generation. Experimental variation is expected to be greater than the BAC and in vitro ligation methods if assembly of RT-PCR fragments are performed, and as such, this bacteria-free protocol is not recommended for biochemical studies without prior plaque purification and virus sequencing.",

            "text": "The development of a cell culture system for PEDV cultivation has been key to enabling PEDV research and is a critical component of reverse genetics rescue of PEDV. Successful in vitro propagation of PEDV was first reported in 1988 using Vero cells (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988), which are derived from kidney epithelial cells of the African green monkey (Yasumura and Kawakita, 1963) and are now used widely in PEDV research. In this study by Hofmann and Wyler, inoculation of Vero cells with field-isolated PEDV of gut origin yielded detectable cytopathic effect involving formation of syncytia containing less than 10 nuclei (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988). After three passages in cell culture, however, Vero infection resulted in much more extensive syncytia (up to 100 nuclei), indicating that a certain degree of adaptation must take place for field isolates to replicate well in culture. Indeed, the success rate of field isolate cultivation can be quite low in Vero cells, and the virus may gradually lose infectivity upon further passaging (Chen et al., 2014). These observations emphasize the need for cell lines allowing for less selective propagation of field isolates. Several traditional and newly established cell lines have, therefore, been examined for their permissiveness for PEDV replication. Table 1, Table 2\nprovide a representative overview of cell lines that have been tested for PEDV propagation. While cells derived from species other than swine have shown susceptibility to PEDV (Table 1), some porcine cells isolated from different organs were found to be non-permissive (Table 2). One technical reason for the inability of porcine primary cells to support PEDV growth could be the standard practice of adding trypsin to promote replication, as primary cells tend to be hypersensitive to trypsin and detach rapidly, preventing efficient PEDV infection (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988). Mechanistically, this may involve viral entry by field isolates and the question of receptor usage, which will be discussed in detail in a later section. Briefly, while several groups have highlighted porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) as the key receptor for cell entry of PEDV (Li et al., 2007, Liu et al., 2015, Nam and Lee, 2010), the considerable number of non-porcine cell lines used for PEDV propagation suggests that other receptors could play a role in infection. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying infection of field isolates would greatly advance development of optimal cell culture systems for PEDV propagation in vitro, as well as minimize cell culture adaptation that may significantly alter PEDV pathogenesis.",

This cleavage generally releases the fusion peptide, which in the cases of influenza virus and HIV is directly positioned at the N-terminus of the second subunit (Gallaher, 1987, Skehel and Waterfield, 1975).

            "text": "By homology to other type I and coronavirus envelope glycoproteins, the PEDV S protein can be divided into two subunits: the N-terminal S1 and the C-terminal S2. The S1 subunit contains the signal peptide (predicted to be residues 1\u201320 (Duarte and Laude, 1994)) and receptor binding ectodomain, while the S2 subunit is fusogenic, containing both the fusion peptide and transmembrane domain. However, for many alphacoronaviruses, including PEDV and TGEV, there is no furin-like cleavage site at the predicted interface between S1 and S2 (Duarte and Laude, 1994), raising the possibility that cleavage may occur primarily at the S\u2019 site. Data gleaned from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV (Simmons et al., 2005) and MHV (Qiu et al., 2006) suggest that such cleavage may occur during the entry process. Observations from cell culture may not reflect the natural mechanism of PEDV infection, however, as the context during host animal infection is likely different. It is known that coronaviruses tend to be highly species- and tissue-specific, with viral tropism being generally associated with receptor distribution. Enteric tropism, such as that of PEDV, is associated with a trypsin-rich environment, and it is possible that in vivo, PEDV S cleavage is mediated by this less discriminating protease. CV777 isolated from pig intestinal perfusate appeared to present S in cleaved form, with a major 89 kDa band and minor 112 kDa and 129 kDa bands (Egberink et al., 1988). Nevertheless, the exact nature of in vivo cleavage and protease susceptibility remains to be definitively determined.",

The Vero-trypsin system is now standard for culturing PEDV in vitro, with regular addition of trypsin required for efficient replication, likely due to trypsin inactivation by Vero cells (Kaverin and Webster, 1995). Robust replication is associated with the formation of extensive syncytia (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988). Trypsin can be functionally replaced by the transmembrane type II serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), as demonstrated by the propagation of PEDV in Vero cells stably expressing TMPRSS2 (Shirato et al., 2011). This promising approach may allow greater exploration of trypsin-sensitive cell lines for isolating and culturing PEDV.",

In the absence of trypsin, these viruses do not appear to form syncytia (Li et al., 2013, Park et al., 2014a, Wicht et al., 2014). Similarly, our own experience with the reverse genetics of AVCT12 has revealed that virus rescued in transfected HEK 293T cells in the absence of trypsin are capable of initiating infection of Vero E6-APN without causing syncytia (unpublished observations). These results hint at the possibility that host proteases within the endosome may play a role in cleaving the S protein. Furthermore, the lack of syncytia supports the idea that the S protein is not cleaved during processing and trafficking to the host cell membrane, and is expressed in the inactive form at the cell surface.",

Recombinant PEDV carrying either S from the trypsin-dependent CV777 strain or the trypsin-independent DR13 were tested for the impact of trypsin on viral entry, with trypsin treatment after receptor binding noticeably increasing relative infection rates of CV777-S virus, and decreasing rates for the DR13-S virus (Wicht et al., 2014). These results suggest that, like SARS-CoV (Matsuyama et al., 2005), PEDV S cleavage by trypsin may occur at the receptor-binding step, possibly due to increased accessibility after receptor binding-induced conformational changes. The significance of receptor binding is supported by similar observations in a study by Park et al. (Park et al., 2011). Trypsin treatment during viral adsorption, but not virus or cell pretreatment, resulted in mild increases in internalized virus and viral titer. This slight change may have been due to the use of KPEDV-9, which has been shown to be trypsin-independent (Kweon et al., 1999, Park et al., 2011, Park et al., 2014a). Interestingly, there is some evidence to suggest that trypsin may play a role during viral egress as well. Electron microscopy of PEDV-infected Vero showed large virion clusters on the cell surface, and increased extracellular viral titers induced by trypsin treatment could be inhibited by leupeptin (Madu et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Indeed, like TGEV (Delmas et al., 1992, Delmas et al., 1993), PEDV has been shown to utilize pAPN as a receptor for host cell entry (Li et al., 2007, Oh et al., 2003). Initial studies detected a 150 kDa band when probing porcine enterocyte and swine testis (ST) membrane proteins with PEDV in a virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA) (Oh et al., 2003). The size of this protein coincided with pAPN, and direct virus\u2013APN binding was found to be dose-dependent and susceptible to competition with anti-pAPN antibodies. Later, expression of a pAPN transgene was shown to enable the non-permissive Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line to support PEDV replication (Li et al., 2007), demonstrating the functional role of APN in PEDV infection. Assessment of pAPN binding to the CHGD-01 strain-derived S1 protein fragments by flow cytometry and ELISA showed strong contribution of the region between amino acids 538\u2013638 in enhancing APN binding. These results suggest that binding function is conferred by the C-terminal domain of S1 (Deng et al., 2016), similar to other coronaviruses such as the APN-binding TGEV and HCoV-229E (Bonavia et al., 2003, Breslin et al., 2003, Godet et al., 1994) and the ACE2-binding HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV (Babcock et al., 2004, Lin et al., 2008, Wong et al., 2004). On the other hand, a co-immunoprecipitation study using the strain KNU-0801 by Lee et al. suggested that the N-terminal region of S1 is responsible for mediating pAPN binding, with amino acids at the 25\u201355 positions resulting in noticeably higher levels of pAPN pulldown (Lee et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the notable differences in S1 fragment expression levels and the lack of comparison with N-terminal truncation fragments leave room for reconciling the results from these two reports. In either case, attempts to characterize S functional domains were limited to binding assays using S1 protein fragments. While these studies provide intriguing insight into the mechanism of S-mediated viral entry, they do not yet demonstrate functional receptor usage by these domains. Manipulation of PEDV S by reverse genetics should enable functional studies in the viral context, supplement our understanding of the binding data, and help account for the differences in experimental results.",

Strangely, VOPBA analysis using the Korean KPEDV-9 strain to probe Vero membrane proteins did not reveal any bands of note, despite the strain being capable of replicating in Vero cells (Oh et al., 2003).

High affinity for N-acetylneuraminic acid has also been identified by a glycan screen, and treatment of human and bovine mucins with neuraminidase was shown to reduce PEDV S1 binding in a dot blot hybridization assay (Liu et al., 2015). The ability to bind sugars is unsurprising, as this property is shared across viruses in the family Coronaviridae. By homology to other alphacoronaviruses such as TGEV, the sugar binding domain of the PEDV S protein is likely to reside in the N-terminus of the S1 subunit. Indeed, ELISA assessing the binding of S1 fragments to bovine mucin demonstrated stronger sugar binding activity in the N-terminal domain of S1, especially within the first 253 residues (Deng et al., 2016). Whether sugars act as functional receptors for PEDV infection of Vero cells and whether such receptor usage is mediated by the N-terminus of S1 remain to be conclusively demonstrated. Such data will also need to be reconciled with observations of Vero replication by PEDV with massive truncations in the S protein, namely Tottori2/JPN/2014, which has a 194-amino acid deletion from residues 23\u2013213 (by CV777 numbering; Fig. 4\n) and was successfully cultivated in Vero cells (Masuda et al., 2015), and PC177, which has a 197-amino acid deletion from residues 34\u2013227 (CV777 numbering) directly arising from adaptation to Vero cells (Oka et al., 2014).",

Firstly, the swine testis (ST) cell line, which is known both for its expression of pAPN and permissiveness for TGEV infection, has not been shown to support PEDV replication. Overexpression of pAPN in ST cells, however, resulted in PEDV-associated cytopathic effects and viral spread as shown by staining of PEDV N proteins (Nam and Lee, 2010), suggesting the possible significance of receptor density or other requirements in receptor usage. In contrast, TGEV infection of ST cells overexpressing APN showed decreased production of TGEV virions (Delmas et al., 1995). TGEV S-pseudotyped lentiviruses have also been shown to infect the feline kidney cell line CCL94 (Wang et al., 2016) and the virus uses feline APN as a receptor, unlike PEDV (Tresnan and Holmes, 1998, Tresnan et al., 1996). Given the distinctive properties of PEDV S and the current availability of reverse genetics systems, we expect that more details regarding this protein and its unique functional structure will be forthcoming.",

Survey of the 754 S1 sequences available in the GenBank database indicate greater circulation of strains containing this INDEL pattern than has been noted previously in literature (Table 3\n).

MF3809 is characterized by a 204-amino acid deletion in the C-terminus of S1 (residues 713\u2013916) and exhibited decreasing viral RNA after passaging in Vero cells (Park et al., 2014b). Tottori2, on the other hand, has a 194-amino acid deletion in the N-terminus of S1 and was capable of adapting to Vero culture (Masuda et al., 2015) (Fig. 4). The 197-amino acid deletion in PC177 is, however, understood to have occurred as a result of adaptation to Vero cells, and it is capable of growing to titers similar to non-deletion variants through at least 8 passages (Oka et al., 2014). Such a significant deletion of the S gene has already been observed with TGEV, where a 224-amino acid deletion in the S1 N terminus yielded the antigenically distinct porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) that targets the respiratory tract of swine (Callebaut et al., 1988, Rasschaert et al., 1990). The deleted region encodes the sugar-binding domain (Krempl et al., 1997, Schultze et al., 1996) and is thought to account for the loss of enteric tropism (Ballesteros et al., 1997, Krempl et al., 1997, Laude et al., 1995). It is tempting to speculate that the INDEL mutations and the large S deletions, localized to the N-terminus of S1, may alter receptor or sugar binding domains, affecting efficiency or selectivity of receptor binding and usage. Reverse genetics will be invaluable for fine delineation of the determinants of entry, tropism and pathogenesis encoded in these regions.",

Most mutations occur during extensive passaging of the virus in cell culture and some have been correlated with viral attenuation. One study reported attenuation of TGEV virulence after serial passaging in cell culture (Woods, 2001). Sequence analysis of the S gene, which was expected to be the primary determinant of attenuation and cell culture adaptation, revealed mostly identical amino acid sequences between the original and serially passaged viruses. Interestingly, the ORF3 from the serially passaged virus was shorter than that of the virulent original. Similarly, a study comparing attenuated and pathogenic PEDV also found a 51-nucleotide deletion in the ORF3 gene of attenuated vaccine strains, including attenuated DR13, KPEDV-9 and P-5V (Park et al., 2008). In addition, KPEDV-9, which had undergone 93 passages in Vero cells, exhibited reduced pathogenicity in neonatal pigs and was described as safe in pregnant sows (Kweon et al., 1999). Therefore, it has been hypothesized that ORF3 truncation may affect PEDV pathogenesis.",

Recently, analysis was performed on the ORF3 of 27 field samples collected from different farms in Fujian, China, between 2010 and 2012 (Chen et al., 2013). These ORF3 exhibited notable heterogeneity and could be divided into 2 groups. Group 1 was composed of 26 viruses with full-length ORF3 (224 amino acids in length) and group 2 had the one strain (P55) with an ORF3 truncation (92 amino acids in length) shared with four selected ORF3 reference sequences (truncated-ORF3 CV777, CH/GSJIII/07, truncated-ORF3 CH/BJ/2011, truncated-ORF3 DBI865, and Zhejiang-08). Despite the truncated ORF3, the virulence of P55 did not differ from that of the isolates in group 1. A different study involved the YN1 field strain, whose ORF3 gene was found to encode an early stop codon at position 145 after serial propagation in Vero cells for 200 passages (Chen et al., 2015). Full-length sequences at passages 15, 30, 60, 90, 144, and 200 had been analyzed, with no changes observed for the NSP2, NSP4\u20137, NSP10, NSP12 and NSP13 genes during the Vero cell adaptation process. Identified mutations included 9\u201326 amino acid changes in ORF 1a/b and S, an early termination codon in ORF3, and 1\u20133 amino acid changes in the E, M and N proteins. The passage 15 virus YN15 had 8 amino acid changes in the ORF3 gene and had already gained the early termination codon. When field-isolated YN1 and cell-adapted YN15 were characterized for pathogenicity in piglets, infected piglets from both groups showed classic and similar signs of infection, with watery diarrhea and emaciation. Therefore, acquisition of a truncated ORF3 by YN1 progeny appears to be more important for cell adaptation than attenuation.",

While this virus grew to the same titers as the original virus, reverse genetics virus with a restored ORF3 gene could not be rescued. These results suggest that ORF3 may negatively affect viral growth in cell culture. On the other hand, an infectious molecular clone was recently generated based on the virulent PEDV strain PC22A, which possesses an intact ORF3 gene (Beall et al., 2016). And while disruption of the ORF3 with red fluorescent protein did not increase viral titer, both wild-type and ORF3-deleted recombinant viruses replicated to titers around 2\u20133 log less than recombinant AVCT12. Interestingly, regardless of the presence of ORF3, all inoculated piglets succumbed to illness or were euthanized due to illness at their final time points. The notable differences between these two studies are likely due to viral genetic background\u2014our reverse genetics report focused on the use of an SM98 vaccine-like strain, which may have other adaptations that render ORF3 dispensable, and even detrimental.",

Table 4\nlists the various ORF3 homologs and their known characteristics. The more extensively studied SARS-CoV ORF3a appears to have multiple functions, including ion channel activity (Lu et al., 2006) and induction of apoptosis (Chan et al., 2009). With structural studies revealing the tetramerization and membrane localization possibly indicative of ion channel properties (Lu et al., 2006), ORF3a was tested for ion channel function by injection of ORF3a RNA into Xenopus oocytes. The results suggested that ORF3a forms a potassium-sensitive channel. In a separate study, FRhk-4 cells transfected with siRNA targeting ORF3a prior to infection with SARS-CoV showed a significant decrease in viral release (Chan et al., 2009). Furthermore, mutations interfering with potassium channel activity abolished caspase-dependent apoptosis. Therefore, the ion channel activity of ORF3a may affect SARS-CoV release and its pro-apoptotic properties.",

The full-length parental ORF3 was expressed poorly compared to the truncated form from the cell-adapted strain, which the authors suggested may be indicative of a degree of functional toxicity. Expression of CV777 ORF3 in Xenopus laevis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, however, did reveal potassium ion channel function, along with the importance of residue Y170 for such activity (Wang et al., 2012). In comparison, truncated ORF3 from cell-adapted CV777 lacked this ion channel activity. Virus production was additionally observed to be reduced after infection when cells were treated with siRNA to silence the ORF3 gene, suggesting that ORF3 may affect viral replication like SARS-CoV ORF3a. A more recent study used a Vero cell line stably expressing ORF3 (Vero-ORF3) to assess the protein\u2019s impact on the host cell (Ye et al., 2015). Aside from its cytoplasmic localization, the observed prolongation of the cell cycle S phase and the appearance of large double-membrane vesicles possibly acting as sites of viral replication (Gosert et al., 2002, Pedersen et al., 1999, Snijder et al., 2006) together suggest that ORF3 may help promote viral growth. Indeed, ORF3 increased viral titers of attenuated viruses, although it had no effect on the non-attenuated field isolate, indicating that ORF3 can play a role in viral replication in vitro.",

With co-transfection experiments, they identified N, especially the immuno-dominant central region, as responsible for PEDV-dependent NF-\u03baB activation through Toll-like receptors 2, 3 and 9. This is in line with a previous report that N from a PEDV strain isolated in Shaanxi province could activate NF-\u03baB (Xu et al., 2013). In IECs stably transfected with a pGFP-N expression vector, upregulation of NF-\u03baB, along with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone GRP78 and IL-8, was observed compared to IECs expressing GFP alone. In contrast, in transfected HEK 293T cells, N derived from strain AJ 1102 inhibited promoter activation of NF-\u03baB, IFN-\u03b2 and IRF3 (Ding et al., 2014). This study also observed inhibition of Sendai virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 production and IFN-stimulated gene expression, suggesting a role for N as an interferon antagonist.

It is commonly known that newborn piglets, though immunocompetent, are usually unable to mount primary immune responses in time to prevent disease onset, especially those associated with acute viral infection. They heavily rely on maternal passive immunity obtained from colostrum and milk, as the placentally transferred antibodies during gestation are not sufficient to confer disease protection (Kim et al., 1966, Tlaskalova-Hogenova et al., 1994). Given that PEDV infects its hosts primarily by directly invading enterocytes lining the intestinal villi and the virus does not require systemic spread, it is likely that mucosal immunity, particularly secretory IgA, is responsible for virus neutralization and disease protection as opposed to the IgG predominantly found in sera of sows vaccinated via the parenteral route. Although PEDV-specific IgG may be present in high amounts in colostrum at parturition in sows intramuscularly vaccinated by PEDV live vaccines (Paudel et al., 2014), protection duration tends to be very short due to rapid decline of colostrum production in post-parturient sows (Klobasa et al., 1987).",

It has been shown recently that sows orally fed with intestinal homogenates obtained from clinically affected piglets exhibit significantly higher levels of milk anti-PEDV neutralizing antibodies compared to those intramuscularly immunized by the iPED+ vaccine (Scherba et al., 2016). Likewise, Paudel et al. showed that oral administration of live attenuated PEDV strain DR-13 to pregnant sows reduces the mortality rate of nursing piglets (Paudel et al., 2014). A different study demonstrated that sows previously exposed to a mild strain of PEDV can passively transfer sufficient lactogenic immunity to piglets for protection against virulent PEDV exposure (Goede et al., 2015). And, in line with studies in PEDV-infected sows, pregnant sows fed with TGEV also exhibit substantially elevated levels of IgA antibodies in milk that confer passive protection against virulent TGEV to piglets (Bohl et al., 1972, Bohl and Saif, 1975, Chattha et al., 2015). In contrast, sows vaccinated with recombinant subunit vaccines based on the TGEV S protein provide inadequate protective immunity against similar challenge (Park et al., 1998).",

Accumulating data seem to suggest that adaptation of PEDV to cell culture affects the efficacy of viruses used as oral vaccines. For instance, sows orally inoculated with parental DR13 displayed higher immune responses when compared to those fed with virus cultured in Vero cells to passages 75 or 90 (Song et al., 2003). Likewise, Chen et al. recently performed virulence experiments by orally inoculating nursing piglets with either a low- (YN15) or high-passage number (YN144) variant of the virulent YN1 strain (Chen et al., 2015). They demonstrated that, while all YN15-infected piglets succumbed to severe diarrhea, those infected with YN144 showed no detectable clinical signs. Immunohistochemical analyses of intestinal samples from YN15- and YN144-infected piglets clearly indicated that YN144 barely infected swine enterocytes. Notably, results from others and our laboratory also suggest that cell-adapted PEDV strains infect and replicate in swine enterocytes less efficiently than in Vero cells (Cong et al., 2015). While it is currently not known exactly how adaptation in cells of non-swine origin can affect the ability of PEDV to initiate infection in swine cells, it is clear that in vivo infection of swine enterocytes is a prerequisite for an effective PEDV vaccine.",

With these considerations in mind, the reverse genetics systems of PEDV available to-date offer great potential for novel vaccine development. With more insight into differences between field-isolated and cell-adapted variants, it will be possible to genetically manipulate the infectious clone of a high-growth PEDV to switch its tropism preference from monkey (Vero) to swine cells. Investigation of Vero and swine enterocyte entry by recombinant viruses may help identify key residues involved in cell adaptation, which should in turn provide insightful information for augmenting entry of cell-adapted PEDV into intestinal cells. Particularly encouraging is the ease in changing viral tropism by generating the reverse genetics-derived coronavirus bearing chimeric or mutant S genes (Kuo et al., 2000, Menachery et al., 2015, Menachery et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 1999), with Phillips et al. analyzing changes in MHV neurotropism conferred by the S of mildly versus highly neurovirulent strains (Phillips et al., 1999). Similarly, PEDV with chimeric S can be used to identify the determinants of viral tropism at the nucleotide level, paving the way towards the engineering of S to harbor domains necessary for enterocyte entry while maintaining the necessary antigenic sites for eliciting humoral protective immunity.",

            "text": "While it is not clearly elucidated what genetic components of cell-adapted PEDV are responsible for its attenuation, changing tropism to favor swine intestinal cells may affect virulence. If so, based on the well-characterized SARS-CoV candidate vaccines (Netland et al., 2010, Regla-Nava et al., 2015), a number of approaches could be employed to attenuate a potential PEDV vaccine. The 2\u2032O-methyl-transferase (2\u2032O-MTase), NSP16, has been shown to be an attractive target for attenuation of many coronaviruses (Menachery et al., 2014). Though not yet studied in detail, genetic modification of PEDV NSP16 may provide a useful tool for virus attenuation. SARS-CoV with a disrupted or mutated E gene has also been generated and was shown to be highly attenuated in vivo (Netland et al., 2010, Regla-Nava et al., 2015). While it is possible for SARS-CoV with a deleted E gene to regain virulence upon serial passaging, further manipulation of the virus genome such as truncating the NSP1 protein can help maintain the attenuated phenotype of the virus (Jimenez-Guardeno et al., 2015). Indeed, the coronavirus NSP1 has been proposed to play a major role in determining the virulence of many coronaviruses, primarily by interfering with the host innate immune response (Zust et al., 2007). A recent study showing that PEDV NSP1 can disrupt type I interferon signaling by degrading the CREB-binding protein (CBP) (Zhang et al., 2016) supports the possibility of modifying this protein for PEDV attenuation.",
