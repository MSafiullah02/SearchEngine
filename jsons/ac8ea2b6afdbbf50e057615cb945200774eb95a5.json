Strain 189332 clusters with strain 188407, but the patient from whom it was isolated had no clear link to the gathering. This suggests that the strains associated with the gathering have established community transmission. The person with strain 186197 had travelled to Vietnam, while strain 190300, from a patient with no history of travelling or attending gatherings, was clustered with strains from Europe (Fig. 1B) .

Cases of the first wave were associated mainly with travel from China and Singapore. About 48% of the cases in the second wave were associated with a religious mass gathering. (B) Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree built with FastTree and based on the complete genomes of 2,364 sequences available at GISAID on 29 March 2020. The 10 Malaysian genomes are named and comprise six genomes from the first wave (dark blue) and the four genomes sequenced in this study (second wave, blue). The date of sample collection is recorded at the end of each strain name.
