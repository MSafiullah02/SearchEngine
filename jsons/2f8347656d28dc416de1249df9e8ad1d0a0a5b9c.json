            "text": "Big data analytics tools have many functions that are common or similar to one another. This is a problem for many organisations that are either interested or have deployed some of the tools. The problem arises because there is no mechanism on how to determine appropriateness of the tools within context in an environment. Some of the implications of the problem are that it is difficult to assess appropriateness of the tools in an environment, which sometimes result to duplication; and the value of the tools. The aim of this project was to propose a solution through a model that can be used to evaluate big data analytics tools for organisations' benefits. The qualitative method, case study approach and semi-structured interview technique were applied in the study. From the analysis, the role of criteria, business and IT alignment, governance, and skill-sets were revealed as critical factors. Based on the factors, a model was developed, which can be used as a building block through which evaluation of big data analytics tools in an organisation is carried out.",

From another angle, the ability to integrate, accessibility, response time are the value of the BDA in some organisations [26] . However, the BDA tools do not operate themselves, which is another challenge that is associated to the concept, and influence the type of value that is obtained. The emerging nature of the BDA makes skillsets scarce [27, 28] .",

Business requirements work toward paving and setting what the business seeks to achieve. The IT requirements are based on attributes such as technology types, co-existence and compatibility, capacity, and flexibility of technologies. The IT requirements seek to enable and support the business requirements toward achieving the objectives of the organisation.
