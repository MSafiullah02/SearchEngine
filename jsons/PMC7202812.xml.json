The disease emerged in Wuhan City, China, in late December 2019 [2] and is highly contagious with rapid human-to-human transmission [3]. The WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global emergency [1]. The confirmed cases rose to 2,101,164 with 140,773 deaths and approximately 532,830 recoveries in almost 210 countries (reported by CSSE). Organizations around the world debated potential therapeutic strategies for treating COVID-19 patients and public health strategies. This pandemic also threatened the economy of the entire world. The complete role and severity of SARS-CoV-2 remain undefined. In this review article, we have focused on determining the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and organ failure. Additionally, we focused on the comorbid population that includes patients with diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease, who are COVID-19.",

It has 4 structural proteins, including envelope, spike, nucleocapsid and membrane. They are comprised of the functional subunits S1 and S2, which are responsible for detecting ACE2 receptors present on the host cells. ACE2 receptors are utilized by the virus to enter the host cells [[6], [7], [8]]. ACE2 expression is detected on type I and type II alveolar epithelium, upper respiratory system, heart, kidney tubular epithelium, pancreas, endothelial cells and enterocytes. Thus, the external spike protein determines the infectious nature and host specificity of SARS-CoV-2. The host cells allow the entry of the virus through the process called endocytosis. Moreover, the transmembrane proximal serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is the host protein that facilitates the entry of the virus through the S protein [5,9]. Additionally, it is involved in priming the S protein and potentiates the cleavage of the spike (Fig. 1\n).",

            "text": "Later, in the cytoplasm, the endosome exposes single-stranded RNA, the virus\u2019 genetic material. The genome of the virus encodes various non-structural proteins like papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the coronavirus main protease, 3C-like protease (3CLpro) [10,11]. The virus then hijacks the machinery of the cell to synthesize the viral polypeptides that encode for the replicase transcriptase complex. The active virus produces RNA through RdRp. Moreover, PLpro actively deubiquitinases certain immune regulator cells like IF3 and NF-\u03baB to suppress the immune response [11,12]. It uses the endoplasmic reticulum to synthesize M and S proteins, which are essential for its outer capsule. The viral proteinases 3CLpro and PLpro more effectively cleave the viral polyproteins with the help of the host translation machinery [10,11]. They produce new spikes and glycoproteins that are assembled into numerous copies of the virus. After replication of the genetic material, the golgi bodies exocytose the viruses, which then attack other cells. The created stress on the endoplasmic reticulum by the virus also induces apoptosis of the healthy host cells after releasing millions of viral copies. The viruses continue to attack other cells or end up as droplets and enter the lungs [13]. As an immune response, a fever is generated as the host\u2019s immune system fights to clear the virus out of the body. Pro-inflammatory chemokines are activated to produce inflammatory cells. CD4 + T helper cells develop immunity against SARS-CoV-2 by producing IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 [14]. SARS-CoV-2 also targets these circulating immune cells and induces apoptosis of CD3, CD8 and CD4 cells, causing lymphocytopenia [[15], [16], [17], [18]]. This results in the overproduction of cytokines, causing a cytokine storm as it is released from the inhibition of innate immunity. The cytokine storm results in hyper inflammation, ultimately causing failure of multiple organs [[19], [20], [21]]. For instance, under severe conditions, a patient\u2019s immune system can attack the lung cells. This results in fluid filling the lungs and cell apoptosis, causing difficulty in breathing. In some cases, this leads to death.",

The patients also experience lung alterations and reduced circulating lymphocytes and platelet counts. Human-to-human transmission usually occurs during the incubation phase or when the patient exhibits symptoms [5]. However, sometimes, a person in the asymptomatic phase is also found to be contagious. Such individuals are referred to as super-spreaders. For these cases, the transmission route was skin to skin or touching inanimate objects mediated via the nose, mouth or eyes [5]. Exhaled respiratory aerosols droplets are airborne and can remain in the air for long periods. Thus, direct inhalation of these aerosol droplets or touching the surface of infected objects like latex, steel, aluminium, or surgical gloves are possible modes of transmission [5]. Thus viruses like SARS-CoV-2 virus remain active outside the host body [22]. Furthermore, faecal and sewage transmission are also possible modes of transmission [22]. Similarly, the virus in sewage was found to be active for a few days to a week [23].",

Additionally, they also predicted that unique antiviral host miRNAs may target SARS-CoV-2 genes. They related past research studies about the inhibitory nature of has-miR-27b-3p in the ACE2 cascade [15]. Moreover, they also determined that has-miR-27b is complimentary to the spike of the Indian strain of SARS-CoV-2. Previous research data also suggested that miR-27b inhibits the replication of HIV-1 [25]. However, they could not provide any experimental evidence regarding this related to SARS-CoV-2, and there are other no research data available in this regard.",

On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported critically ill cases of viral pneumonia. Later, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) identified the virus as SARS-CoV-2 [26]. The Chinese government then mandated a quarantine to control the epidemic stage and to determine the effectiveness of a quarantine against the virus [27]. However, SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted rapidly, quickly crossing borders of various countries. Thus, the number of established cases climbed quickly, causing the WHO to announce COVID-19 a global pandemic disease on March 11, 2020. Initially, China had the most confirmed cases, followed by North America and Europe. Italy and the US, however, surpassed China in terms of the number of established cases. Thus, at this stage of vigorous spread, it is essential to determine the mechanism of viral infection to control and treat the disease. Until now, it was believed that bat, especially Rhinolophus affinis, was the natural host of the virus [7]. It is still uncertain how this virus was transmitted from bat to human, although some research has suggested that pangolin (Manis javanica) could be the intermediate host [14,28,29]. The aggressive intervention steps were taken by governments, such as isolating and quarantining latent patients, have reduced the contact rate and effectively decreased the peak for COVID-19 cases.",

SARS-CoV and 2019-nCov/ SARS-CoV-2 were found to share a common progenitor with HKU9-1, the bat coronavirus. The similarity in the spike structure proteins of SARS-CoV-2 showed a higher affinity with ACE2 as discussed earlier [5]. ACE2 receptors are present on the target cells, making the cells highly susceptible to the entry of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent pathogenesis. For instance, type II alveolar cells (AT2) of the lungs are believed to have higher ACE2 expression and are the primary targets for SARS-CoV-2 [7]. In this study, also examined different cell types from different organs that showed ACE2 expression using single-cell-RNA seq (ScRNA-seq) data to determine the effect of COVID-19 for the first time. We tabulated their results for different organs showing the type of cells tested, the proportion of cells expressing ACE2, and the risk of organ failure in Table 2\n. The expression levels of ACE2 mRNA and protein in different organs were specified with the presence of gene transcription. They further strengthened their work by analysing ACE2 expression levels in various human organs and comparing the results with the Human Protein Atlas, databases like Uniprot and a few works in the literature. Their analysis of various published data demonstrated that ACE proteins are expressed in the epithelial cells of lung alveolar cells, myocardial cells, gastrointestinal cells and renal tubules [6,[30], [31], [32], [33]]. Additionally, myocardial infarctions increase ACE2 expression, increasing the likelihood of cardiac injury [34]. This contributes to the understanding of the effect of COVID-19 on various organs.",

About 23% of COVID-19 ill patients had cardiac injury [17], and 13% showed an elevation in creatinine kinase [35]. The mRNA and protein ACE2 expression levels are higher in these patients with cardiac disease, creating an increased risk for severe COVID-19 complications, including heart failure. Moreover, it was also suggested by Liang Chen et al. that the human heart infected with SARS-CoV-2 attacks pericytes, resulting in microvascular disorders [36]. This microvascular disorder causes dysfunction in capillary endothelial cells, low microvascular reactivity and high vascular permeability. The modelling and docking results also showed that SARS-CoV-2 has a receptor-binding domain that fits well with human ACE2 receptors. Moreover, the amino acid residues including 491Tyr, 441Leu, 479Gln, 487Asn, 472Phe and 480Ser of the SARS-CoV-2 mature spike protein are involved in binding with the ACE2 receptor [36]. Thus, these amino acid residues in the binding domain are important to consider in the design of potential drug treatments. Taken together, these findings show that COVID-19 in patients with cardiovascular disease often results in a critical condition and death.",

Because there is a substantial comparison between the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS, researchers and clinicians should explore the infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 based on the effect of SARS. Earlier research showed that about 6.7% of SARS patients possessed acute kidney injury (AKI), leading to a mortality of almost 91.7% [37]. Thus, physicians need to consider the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the kidney. Cheng et al [38] explored the occurrence of AKI in COVID-19 patients to determine their association. They reported that 14.4% of the COVID-19 patients in the study showed elevated levels of serum creatinine upon admission. Most of these patients were male, older, or had other illnesses. Additionally, 13.1% had elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN). After hospitalization (10 days), the serum creatinine peak elevated to 91 \u00b1 67 \u03bcmol/L, and about 43.9% of the patients showed proteinuria. These patients also showed a higher incidence of AKI (11.9%) after hospitalization; only 5.1% had AKI during admission. The in-hospital mortality recorded was 16.1%; however, those with raised baseline serum creatinine had a mortality rate of 33.7%. Furthermore, the Univariate Cox regression analysis also showed that COVID-19 patients who were male and/or older than 65 were highly prone to in-hospital death. Therefore, clinicians must be aware of kidney diseases in COVID-19 patients after hospitalization as early diagnosis and effective treatment would reduce the death rate in patients.",

            "text": "For these 28 cancer patients in Wuhan who also had COVID-19, the lab findings at the time of admission included low blood count (anaemic), leucopenia and lymphopenia [41]. Additionally, low levels of serum albumin, high levels of serum globulin and high lactate dehydrogenase with sensitive C-reactive protein in higher levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were also detected [41]. The radiological findings included ground-glass opacity, patchy consolidation [43], interlobular septal thickening, reticular appearances and fibrous strips. The patients with patchy consolidations were at greater risk for developing severe problems than those without [43]. Moreover, lung cancer patients were reported with decreased lung volume along with pneumonia [41]. It was also shown that among these malignant patients with COVID-19, 70% of the patients had stage IV cancer and are severe complications [41]. The research and clinical data available now contribute to the proper understanding of the risk of COVID-19 occurrence in malignant patients. Thus, this helps oncologists tailor the COVID-19 clinical management for the benefit of such patients. Additionally, establishing essential guidelines and recommendations for the care of cancer patients based on a patient\u2019s age, affected organ and stage of cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak is very crucial [44].",

            "text": "Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity and/or hypertension and COVID-19 have increased mortality and morbidity rates [17,18,35,42,[45], [46], [47]]. However, the association of DM with hypertension and cardiovascular diseases as risk factors for COVID-19 is still unknown and not clear. In one study that included 52 ICU-admitted COVID-19 patients, about 22% of the patients were diabetic. Of the 52 admitted patients, 32 did not survive [17,44]. This suggests that DM is the predominant comorbidity with COVID-19. A few mechanisms have been suggested by researchers to explain the high susceptible of DM patients to COVID-19 pathogenesis. These include having an efficient cellular binding and easy entry of the virus, low chance for viral clearance, weakened T-cell function, highly prone to cytokine storm and hyperinflammation. Additionally, ACE2 expression weakens with the administration of insulin [48,49], whereas ACE2 expression is upregulated by hypoglycemic agents like thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptides-1, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, antihypertensives and statins [[50], [51], [52], [53], [54]]. The rodent DM model showed higher expression ACE2 in heart, lung, kidney and pancreas compared with normal controls [48,49]. Furthermore, Rao et al [55]. from their Mendelian randomization study determined from the diseases and traits that the lungs of DM patient showed increased expression of ACE2. The protein levels of proteases like furin that facilitate the cleaving of the spike protein for virus entry were also found to be overexpressed in DM patients [56]. In order to understand the association between ACE2 expression in DM patients and COVID-19 infection, we must understand the mechanism of ACE2 action. ACE2 catalyses the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7 and angiotensin 1-9 (Fig. 2\n). These act as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory enzymes and are found to be protective against lung ARDs [57]. After SARS-CoV-2 binds with ACE2, the virus degrades it, and thus the free angiotensin II induces acute lung injury [58]. Additionally, increased loss of potassium levels through urine and increased secretion of aldosterone also result after the intrusion of the virus [35]. Thus, ACE2 is unable to protect against lung injury after the entry of SARS-CoV-2 because ACE2 is degraded by the virus. The aetiology is still confusing, but it is clear that DM patients are at higher risk for severe complications with COVID-19. Thus, we have an urgent need for research studies focused on determining how hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycaemic conditions affect SARS-CoV-2 infection and how DM might affect vaccine efficacy.",

The antibodies developed against viral spike proteins by the host immune system are utilized in developing vaccines. The process includes purifying the plasma that contains antibodies from a recovered COVID-19 patient. The next step is targeting these antibodies to the spike protein of the virus to neutralize it and likely to develop passive immunity against disease [68]. Moreover, structural and sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 with the other lethal CoV viruses such as SARS and MERS would help determine the best epitope to use in the design of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. This would essentially neutralize the viral S protein, although creating a vaccine is a slow process. The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins are 76.5% homologous at the amino acid level [5]. Recently, Wan et al.[69] also determined that SARS-CoV with residue 479 (lysine) and SARS-CoV-2 with glutamine 394 residue recognize and bind to lysine 31 of the ACE2 receptor in humans [70]. An alternate approach is to inject neutralizing antibodies into COVID-19-infected animals to obtain purified polyclonal antibodies from these animals [71]. This process can be expedited, but the outcome is not guaranteed as the animals might not produce the expected neutralizing antisera [72].",

            "text": "ACE2 is a mono-carboxy peptidase that hydrolyses angiotensin II. As discussed earlier, ACE2 binds with high affinity to SARS-CoV-2, thereby allowing the virus to enter the host cells. Thus, targeting the binding site of the ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2 with antibodies or therapeutic drugs might provide a successful treatment strategy. Moreover, ACE2 shows similar homology with ACE, which hydrolyses angiotensin I to angiotensin II [74]. This led to a lot of confusion between ACE inhibitors and ACE2 inhibitors. Increased ACE activity and reduced ACE2 activity promote lung injury. Furthermore, there have been several reports that ACE inhibitors (ACEI) inhibit the expression of ACE2 in kidney and heart [50]. As determined histologically, ACE2 is primarily membrane-bound but is also present as a soluble form in body fluids at a very low level [75,76]. The cleavage in the membrane ADAM17 anchor by a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 present at the membrane-bound ACE2 receptor increases the occurrence of more soluble ACE2 in the body fluids (Fig. 1). Thus, the membrane-bound ACE2 is no longer available for SARS-CoV-2 to bind with it (Fig. 1). Angiotensin II via its type 1 receptor (AT1R) induces the upregulation of ADAM17, which potentiates the cleavage and increases the soluble ACE2 concentration in the body fluids. Thus, AT1R upregulates ADAM17 and increases soluble ACE2 [77], whereas the administration of AT1R blockers (ARB) prevents the process and maintains the membrane-bound ACE2 receptors (Fig. 1). Additionally, ARB is also found to consistently alter the expression of ACE2 at the protein and mRNA levels. ACE2 expression is upregulated in the renal vasculature and cardiac tissue [[78], [79], [80]]. Therefore, using ARB to treat for pathological conditions like lung injury without any complaint of COVID-19 infection is beneficial, but it may be critical during COVID-19 infection [81,82]. Lung injury without SARS-CoV-2 infection is caused by downregulated alveolar ACE2 levels and decreased angiotensin II metabolism [83,84]. However, several researchers have proposed the use of ARB to protect against lung injury during COVID-19 infection.",

The current clinical trials performed to determine the efficacy of drugs against COVID-19 are tabulated in Table 4\n. Moreover, in the most recent studies, Liu et al.[85] determined that the serum levels of angiotensin II are increased in COVID-19 patients who had pneumonia and lung injury. This indicates that SARS-CoV-2 disrupts the balance of the ratio of ACE/ACE2, resulting in increased levels of angiotensin II. This further induces inflammation, pulmonary vasoconstriction and oxidative organ damage, causing acute lung injury. Thus, the modulation of RAS by ARBs or recombinant ACE2 increases the amount of ACE2 receptors and controls the levels of angiotensin II [86]. Moreover, this also increases the level of soluble ACE2 that competitively binds with SARS-CoV-2, causing delayed entry of the virus into cells and protecting against lung injury.",

For instance, remdesivir is a drug developed against the Ebola virus specifically, but it showed promising results when used to treat MERS-CoV infection [63]. Remdesivir, conceals the viral RNA polymerase and prevents the proofreading to occur via the viral exonucleases. This way it decreases the viral RNA production in the host cells (Fig. 1). Remdesivir was also suggested to give positive results when used against SARS-CoV-2, and a clinical trial sponsored by the NIH began in February 2020. However, the clinical impact of this drug against COVID-19 is still unclear and researchers are waiting for the outcome of the patient\u2019s ongoing clinical trials.",

Both of these drugs are found to be very effective in treating dysregulations caused by a coronavirus in China [63]. It was notably reported that chloroquine inhibits the replication of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-1. It was also found to prevent the entry of virus by inhibiting the glycosylation of ACE2 receptors, block proteases and regulate acidification in the endosome (Fig. 1). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine also promote an immunomodulatory effect via the production of cytokines and suppress autophagy and lysosomal functionality in host cells [90,93]. Chloroquine was identified to suppress SARS-CoV-2 growth in vitro, showing more than a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) with a low micromolar range [94]. There are no adverse side effects known for the proposed usage of chloroquine against COVID-19 [95]. There was a sharp increase in the prescription of these drugs for COVID-19 patients with the reference of USA President Mr Donald Trump in late March in the US (https://www.bbc.com/news/51980731). Furthermore, it was also granted by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine drug as an emergency as authorized for COVID-19 therapy. There are more than 20 clinical trials carried in the US, UK, China and Spain on these drugs. The later reports from the clinical trials also suggested that chloroquine drug would minimise the disease duration [95]. Bur, later on, April 24, the FDA also licenced the usage of the drug issued under the warning regarding the dangerous threat for the serious heart rhythm adverse side effects in COVID-19 patients when used. However, to get a complete clearance of virus, chloroquine is combined with other drugs. For instance, hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin resulted in greater clearance of virus than hydroxychloroquine alone [96].",

The expedition of clinical trials for various potential therapeutic drugs is essential to evaluate their efficacy at this midpoint of the pandemic. The pressure on researchers to develop promising therapeutic drugs for COVID-19 is very high. These drugs include cytokines and bioengineered and vector-based antibodies to block the gene expression of the virus and to develop a vaccine. However, there are currently no therapeutic drugs available to treat COVID-19. Clinical symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection should be closely monitored to determine whether the virus has infected internal organs so that appropriate therapy can be performed. A patient\u2019s demographic data and past medical history are crucial to forming a good therapeutic plan. Moreover, together, antiviral research and clinical trials will improve the effectiveness of therapy and facilitate the production of a drug or vaccine in record time. In this article we focused on the effect of COVID-19 with other diseases (comorbidities) and associated organ injury to provide researchers with a better understanding of the clinical implications of COVID-19. We also focused on the ongoing research and clinical trials conducted for the benefit of COVID-19 patients to determine the efficacy of drugs for treatment.",

Lopinavir and remdesivir inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro).
