            "text": "Organ failure is an ongoing challenge to the intensive care specialist. This is particularly true in the field of pediatrics. Development of organ dysfunction involves the activation of the microvascular endothelial system by overexpression of adhesion molecules [1, 2, 3]. Adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and E-selectin are expressed on the surface of endothelial cells and mediate the migration of leukocytes to inflamed tissue. E-selectin is expressed only on endothelial cells and is responsible for the first contact with leukocytes [4]. VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 are expressed on leukocytes and a wide variety of cell types as well as the endothelium. The soluble forms of these adhesion molecules which are detectable in the serum are correlated with their cellular expression [5]. Agonists such as lipopolysaccharides and proinflammatory cytokines can induce the expression of all three adhesion molecules, whereas other agents specifically activate only one. Upon in vitro stimulation with endotoxin or cytokines E-selectin expression reaches a maximum at 6 h and returns to baseline at 24 h; levels of cell adhesion molecules as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 peak between 12 and 24 h and remain elevated for at least 48 h [6]. Elevated serum levels of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, or E-selectin have been found in intensive care patients with various causes of organ dysfunction. A significant increase in these adhesion molecules has been demonstrated in children and adults with sepsis-induced multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [2, 7, 8, 9]. In patients with multiorgan dysfunction serum levels of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin are stable over the course of days [8, 10].",

This was in accordance with the only comparable pediatric study concerning this issue of Whalen et al. [10]. However, in the study by Whalen et al. [10] organ failure included the assessment of six organ systems (additionally: hepatic system) according to the criteria of Doughty et al. [17]. The criteria that we used for the definition of an organ dysfunction were at least more stringent than the criteria of Doughty et al. [18] or of more recently published criteria. The patients in our MODS group were therefore more severely affected than those in other studies. We found significantly higher E-selectin serum levels in infectiously triggered organ failure. However, the interpretation of our results is limited by the number of patients and the heterogeneity of the study population with regard to age and cause of illness.",

There was also no difference in levels of the three adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin) in relation to the severity of pulmonary failure, although pulmonary endothelial damage is pivotal to severe pulmonary failure, and an increase in these adhesion molecules has been shown in adults with ARDS [20]. These differences may be related to the above discussed limitation of our study.",
