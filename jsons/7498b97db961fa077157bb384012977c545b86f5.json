The most revolutionary feature of the human security paradigm is that the referent of security has shifted from the state to the individual human being. Layers of government, international organizations, donor agencies, business, civil society, religious communities and other organizations are all expected to contribute to this end: securing freedoms for individual human beings (CHS 2003; Kaldor 2007) .",

The first category is the threats coming from the 'physical system' of the earth. The Pacific Ring of Fire and the Eurasian seismic zone are conducive to massive shakings of the surface of the earth, and to gigantic tsunami when seismic waves run through the ocean, as demonstrated in the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 (nearly 250,000 fatalities), the Sichuan Earthquake in 2008 (nearly 90,000 fatalities), and the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 (nearly 20,000 fatalities). There are also hundreds of active volcanoes in the region. In addition, typhoons in the Pacific Ocean and cyclones in the Indian Ocean devastate the coastal areas of the region very often. In 2008, some foreign countries attempted to organize a military rescue operation into Myanmar when many people were imperiled by Cyclone Nargis (that eventually claimed the lives of more than 140,000). The islands of the Philippines are also shaken by the frequent landfall of typhoons. Finally, there are dire predictions that climate change and resultant floods and droughts may wreak havoc on agricultural production and threaten food security.",

Major diseases that have demanded urgent responses in East Asia include human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/ AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian flu. A serious disease that broke out in another region, such as the Ebola hemorrhagic fever, could have been transmitted to East Asia in the absence of protective efforts. In the meantime, cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported in several East Asian countries. Regional cooperation is indispensable to control these epidemics as they spread through the cross-border migration of people and animals, and the circulation of goods. Enhanced connectivity of people and goods may endanger people's health and well-being, given the rapid pace in which the global and regional economy is being integrated.",

After World War II, the region witnessed major conflicts such as the Korean War, as well as the prolonged wars in Indochina directly involving the USA, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and China. The continued division of Korea and the tension in the Taiwan Strait are graphic examples of the lingering legacy of the Cold War, and North Korea's brinkmanship diplomacy toying with nuclear missiles has been a real threat to human security in the region. Setting aside ideological confrontations, serious inequality and ethnic minority issues can be found in the borderlands, for example, in the interior regions of China, Okinawa in Japan, Mindanao in the Philippines, Aceh in Indonesia, and in the South of Thailand. These are all highly sensitive issues in their national political contexts. On the other hand, as the economies in East Asia are more and more closely connected, the effects of a possible economic crisis will be felt in every corner of the region. The idea of a human security that attaches a high value to people's welfare was openly advocated by Mr. Keizo Obuchi, the then Foreign Minister of Japan, in Singapore in May 1998 after the Asian Financial Crisis hit the region (Kurusu 2011) .",

For example, there is no 'pure' natural disaster; the casualties from natural disasters like floods and earthquakes hinge on the quality of social systems, including self-help activities at the level of neighborhood communities, as well as the quality of environmental planning and civil engineering. Climate change occurs at the level of the physical system but is clearly an outcome of industrial activities of humans. It is also known that a large proportion of the deaths during famines and violent conflicts is due to the outbreak of infectious diseases in relief camps. 2 Despite these entanglements, as Akihiko Tanaka indicates in Chapter 2, we have a clear division of academic disciplines corresponding to the three systems: the physical system is the subject of physical and chemical sciences and engineering; the living system is studied by biological, medical and ecological sciences; and the social system is researched by the social sciences and the humanities. Human security provides a powerful raison d'etre for multidisciplinary collaboration between experts with those academic backgrounds. Although the three systems (the earth, the ecosystem and human society) can be harmful to individual human beings, it must be noted that they are also beneficial and even indispensable for the prosperity and well-being of the entire human race: natural energy, biodiversity and robust human institutions are all parts of the three systems. We must be prepared, however, to minimize the threats from the same systems for the sake of human survival.",

First, the state is expected to play an essential role in securing basic freedoms for citizens in the face of various risks; the question is whether this role is best performed by a Leviathan (Thomas Hobbes) or by a democratic republic (Immanuel Kant). In either case, in a state of nature, states in international relations may cause harm to one another if there are no legal and normative restrictions on state behavior. Kant argued that, for the sake of its own national security, a state voluntarily seeks alliances with other states, to form a 'federation of peoples' to maintain international peace. Following this logic, world states organized the League of Nations in 1920 and the UN in 1945.",

The idea of a cosmopolitan right is therefore not fantastic and overstrained; it is a necessary complement to the unwritten code of political and international right, transforming it into a universal right of humanity. (Kant 1970 (Kant [originally 1795 Kant was terrified by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and tsunami and wrote several monographs about scientific causality and people's vulnerability in such a grave natural disaster. The principal goal of government is to realize human rights and security in every part of the world. According to Kant, the ultimate purpose of the principles of national security (based on civil rights) and international security (based on international rights) is to contribute to the assurance of personal security (based on cosmopolitan rights). Security of human individuals is not a means to an end, but an end in itself. National security and international security are of critical importance because they can provide powerful means to protect and promote the well-being of people, not the other way around. The international relations of East Asia after the end of World War II are characterized by national independence and vigilance against various forms of colonialism. However, in the twenty-first century, the diversity and the cross-border nature of threats to human security compel regional actors to engage in collaborative actions based on cosmopolitan sympathy and commitment. Sadako Ogata once indicated that 'human security reinforces state security but does not replace it' (Ogata 2003, 5) , which means that human security is expected to complement and 'humanize' state security.",

Eventually, the concept of human security was formally agreed upon at the UN General Assembly in September 2012. According to the resolution entitled the 'follow-up to Paragraph 143 on human security of the 2005 World Summit Outcome,' the notion of human security includes 'the right of people to live in freedom and dignity, free from poverty and despair. All individuals, especially vulnerable people, are entitled to freedom from fear and freedom from want, with an equal opportunity to enjoy all their rights and fully develop their human potential.' Human security is therefore to address 'widespread and cross-cutting challenges' with 'people-centered, comprehensive, context-specific and prevention-oriented' methods, strengthening 'the protection and empowerment of all people and all communities.' And, human security 'is distinct from the responsibility to protect and its implementation' (UNGA 2012) .",

            "text": "At the turn of the last century, the notion of responsibility to protect (R2P) was popular as a 'narrow' interpretation of the idea of human security. Elaborated under the leadership of the Canadian government, the R2P was meant to relate the concept of human security exclusively to freedom from fear (preventing genocide, war crime, ethnic cleansing, and other gross and wide-scale violation of human rights). The R2P was eventually separated from the 'comprehensive' understanding of human security, which has been recognized as the legitimate interpretation of human security in the UN (UNGA 2012). Contrary to the conventional understanding, however, it must be remembered that the principle of R2P also paid respect to national ownership at least on paper. The influential report of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) maintains that 'prevention is the single most important dimension' of the R2P (ICISS 2001, xi) , and successive UN documents confirm that each state has the responsibility to protect its own citizens and that the international society is obliged to assist states to develop that protective capacity (UNGA 2005, paras 138 and 139; UNGA 2009 ). In the R2P discourse, military intervention is considered only the last resort, and development cooperation in ordinary times is considered effective in preventing conflict by providing incentives for adversarial parties to collaborate. The R2P has shifted the notion of sovereignty from state 'control' of people in its territory to the state's 'responsibility' to protect its own people.",

As discussed by Kant, a 'gradually expanding federation' of autonomous states is much preferred to a single global monarchy, under which 'laws progressively lose their impact as the government increases its range, and a soulless despotism, after crushing the germs of goodness, will finally lapse into anarchy' (Kant 1970, 105, 113) . Even in the Kantian universalist world of cosmopolitan rights, therefore, mutual understanding between independent nations and communities with different cultures, languages and religions remains critically important. The universalism of the UN culminated in the launch of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in January 2016. Human security is expected to contribute to the realization of the SDGs by ensuring that no one is left behind and directing our attention to the threats that would hamper the expansion of people's freedoms specified as the 17 goals and 169 targets of the SDGs. To this end, a wide variety of non-state actors including NGOs and businesses are expected to collaborate with each other.",

The comprehensive understanding of human security consists of several elements with specific keywords: freedom from 'fear' and 'want,' freedom to live in 'dignity,' and combination of 'protection' and 'empowerment.' Even if policy makers and activists have not heard of the concept of human security, practice and legal entitlements relevant to these elements can be easily found in different places in East Asia. As indicated by researchers in Vietnam, human security in East Asia can be 'a jigsaw puzzle, in which the pieces are identified and well grasped, but have not been put together' (Dung and Lan 2015, 27) . Regarding responses to serious human security crises, it has been established that East Asians prefer a multilateral or bilateral solution to the unilateral intervention of powerful countries. 3",

This set of three research questions is based on the perception that the practice of human security is still largely state-centric, piecemeal and protection-oriented in East Asia as well as in the world.

Air pollution affects the lungs of haves and have-nots equally, but it is often the poor population living in lowlands who are washed away at the time of a cyclone. The logics of risk and class are thus intertwined (Beck 1992) . Third, paying respect to the dignity of people who face human insecurity must be of prime importance in promoting empowerment. This element of dignity is the last addition to the concept of human security and has started to attract attention from aid practitioners and thinkers. 6 Regional and subnational dimensions are important in human security practice. But, it must also be noted that respect for national dignity and culture is essential for successful collaboration for human security. In the East Asian context, the salience of nationalism is partly due to the history of colonial domination by the Western powers and Japan that devastated the region and deprived people and communities of dignity.

At the same time, the Chinese government was concerned about the possibility that some anti-regime forces might take advantage of the presence of foreigners. The author argues that this political logic has important implications for human security in disaster situations and proposes practical ways to deliver aid to people without downplaying nationalist consciousness. In a similar vein, examining the experience of the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, Chapter 4 (Oscar A. G\u00f3mez) indicates that conventional aid such as sending relief goods and rescue teams may be of little use, sometimes even burdensome. Declining useless relief should not be denounced but normalized. Non-conventional aid such as special skills to deal with the nuclear accident appeared more useful in this case, although these forms of aid require coordination and preparation in peacetime.

Contrasting human security with national security, Chapter 11 (Shin-wha Lee) examines South Korea's policies toward global refugees and North Korean defectors, an effective indicator of regime instability. It is argued that security and welfare of individual persons, which are the very reason for the existence of a sovereign state, must be prioritized in human security practice. The policy development in this regard is essential for a middle-power nation like South Korea. Chapter 12 (Surangrut Jumnianpol, Nithi Nuangjamnong and Sompong Srakaew) illustrates what a regional organization can and should do to put an end to human trafficking. Thousands of fishermen have fallen prey to human traffickers and been found on distant Indonesian islands. The authors distinguish several categories of sovereignty and argue that the affected ASEAN countries should compromise some principle of sovereignty to address international crime effectively. Rehabilitation, justice and public awareness are much needed to tackle the issue, and all these activities should be coordinated by ASEAN.",

In doing so, we should remember that East Asian nations share some degree of developmentalist attitudes. Although the scope of human security is much wider than economic growth, it is nonetheless true that the continuous process of robust growth has provided powerful means to lift people out of poverty and insecurity in the region. Globalization and the resultant connectivity of the East Asian region cause impending human security threats and, at the same time, give rise to collaborative action to address them. While the clouds of nationalist confrontations loom large in East Asia, there are multiple regional dialogues and coordinated actions to tackle cross-border human security challenges. It is, therefore, imperative to draw lessons from the collaborative experience of East Asian nations in the field of human security.",

Issues pertaining to human security should be resolved primarily at the local level, and authorities at higher levels are required to intervene only when problems could not be effectively addressed by people themselves at the local level. 7 In order to address human insecurities effectively, it is essential to consolidate multilateral frameworks embodied in the UN system where the idea of human security was born. However, the best school of global governance is the practice of regional governance as we have learned from the chapters in this book.",

The lessons of the East Asian experience of securing human freedoms are now presented to East Asians as well as to the outside world for mutual learning. noTes 1. While threats to human security have been mainly discussed in the fields of international relations (IR), political science and security studies, the same challenges have also been taken up in development economics and risk studies. See, for example, World Bank (2001, 2013) , JICA (2006), Mine (2007) . 2. This point was illuminated in the work of Alex de Waal on the famine experience in Africa (de Waal 1989) . Jared Diamond argued that the immune system that Europeans acquired through animal husbandry was instrumental in their conquest of the Americas (Diamond 1997 ). 3. The country papers are available at: http://jica-ri.jica.go.jp/publication/ workingpaper/, accessed on January 26, 2018. A collection of revised and updated versions of these papers is published as Human Security Norms in East Asia (Palgrave Macmillan 2018). Based on this country-based survey of the process of diffusion of the human security norm, we commenced an issue-based inquiry into the human security practice on the ground. The present volume is an outcome of this second phase of the research project. 4. This categorization of seven areas is a convenient way to illustrate human security issues, but the challenge is to know how those security areas are related to each other. 5. 'Comprehensive security' also addresses multiple threats, but in this framework the chief security providers are clearly the national governments. 6. The potential of the dignity concept started to be discussed only after CHS (2003) . Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy (2008) tried to go beyond 'fear and want.' 7. This principle is called 'subsidiarity' and embedded in the EU law. The principle seems to be very useful when we understand the relationship between protection and empowerment.",
