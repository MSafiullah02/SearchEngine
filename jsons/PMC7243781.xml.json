            "text": "Clinical medicine is replete with examples of diseases where there is a disparity between the diagnostic criteria used to ascertain the presence of the disease and the pathophysiological dysfunction of the disease. Clinicians also study and treat a number of non-diseases, such as pregnancy, as well as conditions straddling the line between disease and risk for disease (such as the early stages of atherosclerosis). As Christopher Boorse wrote in 1977 (564\u2013565), \u201cThe distinction between normal variation and underlying disease is one of the most important features of medical theory, though in practice it is often hard to draw because so much clinical evidence is gross output.\u201d Given that most clinical evidence is indeed gross output (blood glucose levels, for example), whereby laboratory tests at most only offer a proxy for or rough indication of the dysfunction present (e.g., defects in pancreatic beta cells, adipose tissue, the incretin system), ascertaining the presence of disease is not always as straightforward as it may seem. This is especially true for asymptomatic conditions, but also for conditions in which the dysfunction is mild or difficult to discern. Although there are multiple nosologies of disease, there is less discussion in the philosophical or medical literature on the classification of clinical conditions (with some exceptions, such as Kline, 1986; Engelhardt, 1996, ch. 5; Caplan, McCartney, & andSisti, 2004; Schwartz, 2008, 2014a; Doust, Walker, & Rogers, 2017; and Hofmann, 2016, 2017). Clinical conditions include conditions that look like diseases but are not; conditions that are diseases but that (currently) have no diagnostic criteria; and other types, including those relating to risk for disease (-blinded for review-, 2020, Figure 1). This paper is meant to fill that gap by examining factors important for characterizing clinical conditions, to arrive at a typology of clinical conditions. Through analysis of a wide variety of detailed clinical examples, I show how nosology, research, and decisions about diagnostic criteria should include normative as well as naturalistically describable factors, even when relying on a naturalist conception of disease.",

The BST has seen its fair share of criticism, with many authors finding the naturalist conception of disease to be untenable. The typology in part serves the purpose of justifying using \u201cdisease\u201d in this particular way, and therefore implicitly underscores the BST's usefulness. By the BST, biological dysfunction is necessary for a condition to be a disease. Following from the other requirements of the BST (discussed in Boorse, 2014), one way to characterize disease is as the pathophysiological defects constituting a statistical subnormality of physiological function.",

            "text": "As is explained in detail later, the typology is formed from three factors: symptomaticity, dysfunction, and the meeting of diagnostic criteria. The intersection of these factors creates the typology's eight categories. These categories clarify relationships among clinical conditions (and show how they extend beyond a narrow focus on disease), and provide a framework for understanding diagnostic criteria, how they change, and why they should change, such as depending upon what (if any) symptoms a person exhibits at a given time. Unless otherwise mentioned, by diagnostic criteria I mean current criteria. Typically these involve the presence of symptoms and signs (such as results of laboratory tests, imaging, genetic analysis). However, for many conditions, such as cluster headache, mostly or only symptoms constitute official diagnostic criteria (e.g., those promulgated by medical society guidelines for use in clinical practice). This highlights the fact that for many conditions the existence of pathophysiology is assumed on the basis of the presence of symptoms. Yet recent calls for revisions in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Huntington disease diagnostic criteria advocate inclusion of AD and Huntington disease biomarkers (Jack et al., 2018; Reilmann, Leavitt, & Ross, 2014). This underscores the notion that there is not always a close correspondence between AD and Huntington disease clinical symptoms and their respective pathophysiological signs. Indeed, pathological changes can be present in the brains of people with AD years before the manifestation of symptoms (Jack et al., 2011, p. 258), whereas people with Huntington disease possess the mutant gene from birth and often undergo a long presymptomatic phase (Reilmann et al., 2014). How these and other conditions are defined (through diagnostic criteria) has profound implications for clinical practice, research, and society (regarding insurance, stigma, and other effects of being labeled with a clinical condition). A chief goal of this paper is to explain how normative considerations determine which typology categories a condition can be in and therefore whether biological dysfunction or symptoms are more important for defining a disease. The usefulness of the typology may lie in both identifying main distinguishing features of clinical conditions but also in using the distinctions to think through the implications of different classifications.",

They are also not kidney specific and need to be interpreted within the clinical context.

AKI has multiple etiologies and proper diagnostic tools should distinguish these. As will be discussed below, similar situations exist for other diseases, including chronic ones.

Symptoms need not be communicated to a clinician to be a symptom and need not represent an underlying disease; thus, dyspnea is still a symptom if not observed by a pulmonologist, and does not necessarily indicate or reflect a lung disease, especially if experienced after strenuous exercise. Stiffness on awakening could be a symptom of arthritis, or a consequence of a bad bed. Hunger and unwanted feelings could be symptoms, even though they generally are not: patients do not typically complain of hunger, although when they do a clinician might inquire if the hunger is ravenous, in which case it could indicate a clinical condition (e.g., bulimia). But it would be the odd parent who takes a child complaining of hunger to the doctor instead of giving them food.

Failure to be brilliant and lack of optimal happiness or flourishing are not symptoms on my usage because they are signs. A feeling of failing to be brilliant or not being optimally happy could be a symptom, however, but typically is not. One reason clinicians mostly do not recognize any unwanted feeling as a medically relevant symptom is because in most cases an unwanted feeling is not indicative of disease. It could simply represent normal variation or a reaction to a life event or circumstance and not reflect the presence of an underlying biological dysfunction or disease process.

There are many diseases for which the pathology is too difficult to assess, so the diagnostic criteria for the disease consist solely of symptoms or behavioral signs. Meeting diagnostic criteria is how diseases are identified in clinical practice. In some cases this involves specific pathology, as identified through whatever tests are available that could indicate the key dysfunction is present. In other cases this might solely involve symptoms, which for some conditions, at least some of the time (e.g., AD), provide a strong indication the key biological dysfunction is present, whereas for other conditions (e.g., depression) sometimes only tenuously (if at all) link to pathology.",

It also shows how for some of the DSM-5 conditions biological dysfunction could be present, whereas for others absent, a point also made by Olbert and Gala (2015) on their way to arguing for the distinct role played by symptomatology in mental versus somatic disorders. The intriguing example they give involves the difficulty believing a person could have a mental disorder without that person experiencing that disorder's defining symptoms (e.g., depression diagnosed by biomarkers in a patient without any depression symptoms; Olbert & Gala, 2015, p. 215). As will be discussed for AD, any incredulity this might engender depends on the condition; AD, like depression, is listed in the DSM-5, but unlike depression has biomarkers available that can identify AD's neuropathological signature even in a patient not yet exhibiting dementia. This raises the possibility of asymptomatic diagnosis, something conceivable for a neurological condition but seemingly bizarre for a psychiatric one.",

On the BST and by the lights of the typology such carriers would be diseased. However, Wakefield argues that an asymptomatic infectious disease carrier is not diseased (2014, 664). He offers the case of Typhoid Mary, acknowledging that dysfunction was present, but denying that she was diseased because there was no symptomatic harm to her (although there was harm to others). Boorse recognizes that Wakefield's view of disorder as a harmful dysfunction is similar to his own view of therapeutic abnormality (1997, 49): \u201cwith dysfunction analyzing the \u201cdisease\u201d part and harm analyzing the \u201cclinical\u201d part.\u201d However, not all symptoms cause harm. Treatment, by contrast, involves normative notions, so it is interesting to note that multiple sclerosis, even if asymptomatic, may still be treated (in the hopes of slowing progression), whereas a carrier of herpes simplex virus type 1 typically is not treated if they do not have a cold-sore outbreak, despite what could involve a potential reduction in the transmissibility to others. A multitude of factors thus influences the decision to treat, which partly rests on the distinction between (potential) harm to self and (potential) harm to others. Similarly, there are other categories of clinical conditions, such as category F, where disease is not present yet normative considerations still play an important role. For example, drapetomania (Caplan et al., 2004) is not a disease because it involves no dysfunction, yet the decision to \u201ctreat\u201d an absconding slave would definitely involve a normative consideration\u2014in this case, quite an evil one.",

Typically, risk-based conditions are those for which overdiagnosis is a problem.

Hypothyroidism, for example, presents similar issues as with other continuous-variable \u201cdiseases\u201d, but because the range is so narrow for which dysfunction is present, there may be fewer cases of overdiagnosis than in type 2 diabetes or hypertension. Moreover, mild elevation of thyroid stimulating hormone might not always reflect dysfunction but could be a sign of normal aging (Surks & Hollowell, 2007). Schwartz (2014a) equates pathology with dysfunction, which is different than suboptimal or below-average function. Type 2 diabetes, for example, becomes a disease when dysfunction is present but is still a disease for many HbA1c levels (i.e., the high ones), just not those that do not involve any underlying dysfunction. Risk-based \u201cdiseases\u201d as Schwartz terms them is thus a misnomer on the typology (they should be called \u201crisk-based conditions\u201d) because it is only on current expanded-boundary diagnostic criteria that they are (wrongly according to Schwartz) considered diseases. Risk-based conditions show how a condition can straddle the boundary between one and another typology category (B and D). When diagnostic criteria lower the threshold by which a person is considered to have a disease, more people who are not diseased may be classified as being diseased, resulting in overdiagnosis and the medicalization of normal variation.",

She thinks that medium or severe hypertension in itself is probably not a dysfunction. Schwartz (2008) considers these levels dysfunctional, in contrast to mild hypertension which he considers to not involve dysfunction. Giroux\u2019s (2015, 188) critique is motivated by the divergence between blood pressure as a quantitative variable representing the level of functional efficiency and as a direct measurement of dysfunction of the circulatory system. Because she is correct that blood pressure is not a direct measurement of the dysfunction (i.e., functional efficiency) of the circulatory system (in most cases at least), she cannot find a basis for saying that any degree of hypertension represents dysfunction. Indeed, hypertension, as well as blood glucose levels, could be indications of disease, although they are also potentially pathogenic themselves (such as with glucotoxicity or when blood pressure gets really high, as pointed out by Boorse [2012]). Nonetheless, it is possible that there is dysfunction not only in medium or severe hypertension but even in mild hypertension. The dysfunction may just not rise to the level of clinically apparent dysfunction. There may still be dysfunction (such as at the level of the cell or molecule), that is undetectable with current clinical and diagnostic tools. But as Boorse (2012) notes, although there may be reduced functional efficiency in mild hypertension, if this is not age-excessive, then it does not count as disease on the BST. In summary, conflation of risk for disease or potential indicators of dysfunction, such as some levels of blood pressure, with dysfunction itself, can result in erroneous attribution of disease, a point to which diagnostic criteria should be sensitive if they are to accurately characterize a condition.",

In fact, a myasthenia gravis specialist, because of cost and other issues, may almost never encounter a patient tested for antibodies prior to entering the clinic with suspected myasthenia gravis (Prof. Dr. Joseph Bergmans, personal communication). Clinicians will typically diagnose (or are able to diagnose) a suspected case of myasthenia gravis even without antibody testing, solely on the basis of clinical presentation and/or electromyography results (Prof. Dr. Joseph Bergmans, personal communication).

For example, 100 years ago a person with the Huntington disease expansion still had Huntington disease even if unaware of their carrier status and not yet symptomatic. A similar situation exists for familial AD, because people with such genetic mutations are virtually guaranteed to develop dementia, the symptomatic hallmark of AD (Dubois et al., 2014, p. 615). Yet AD presents an even more intriguing test case for the typology than Huntington disease. This is because most cases of AD are of the sporadic type (Dubois et al., 2016, p. 298) and not all AD-biomarker\u2013positive people develop cognitive impairment (Jack et al., 2018, p. 538). Nonetheless, recently proposed research diagnostic criteria allow for an AD diagnosis based entirely on biomarker findings (Dubois et al., 2016; Jack et al., 2018). Although these new diagnostic criteria are intended for research, some clinicians around the world do use biomarkers as an aid to diagnosis (Frisoni et al., 2017). This means some AD-diagnosed people could fall under category B or D, depending upon whether biological dysfunction is present. The implications of this are discussed next.",

AD was therefore a syndrome (collection of symptoms). The presence of AD neuropathology was simply presumed (Jack et al., 2018), with only autopsy providing a definite confirmation. However, the existence of individuals with AD pathology but no AD symptoms, and AD symptoms but no AD pathology (Jack et al., 2018, p. 538), called into question this presumption. Although autopsy can confirm an AD diagnosis, this is rarely done now given the availability of in vivo biomarkers previously validated against postmortem AD pathology. Moreover, biomarker-based diagnostic criteria have recently been proposed for AD, enabling diagnosis independent of clinical symptoms, such as in the predementia phases. Brain biopsy is rarely performed to diagnose AD because it has low diagnostic yield\u2014not only because it is too difficult and risky (not least of which from general-anesthesia sequelae) but because it is not sensitive and specific enough (Venneti et al., 2011; Warren et al., 2005).",

This has resulted in a tension within AD diagnostic criteria (or, alternately put, a lack of consensus in the AD field as to what the diagnostic criteria should be), between symptom/neuropsychological-testing\u2013based criteria and biomarker-based criteria. This tension is borne out in different recommendations for research diagnostic criteria promulgated by AD research groups, such as the research framework of the NIA-AA (Jack et al., 2011, 2018) and that of the International Working Group (IWG)/Dubois AD diagnostic criteria (Dubois et al., 2014, 2016). The latest NIA-AA framework defines AD as a biological entity, solely by its pathophysiology as evidenced by biomarkers, without consideration of symptoms (Jack et al., 2018). This allows for a biomarker-based diagnosis in asymptomatic people. By contrast, the IWG AD diagnostic criteria require both symptoms and biomarkers (Dubois et al., 2014).

Indeed, reconceptualizing AD as solely a biological entity privileges a disease approach instead of an illness approach. It could even result in a worry-type illness state characterized by anxiety over the putative certainty of developing dementia, compounded by the negative societal consequences of being labeled as having AD. In addition to challenging common notions of dementia as understood by lay people, cultural differences in how dementia is perceived around the world (Alladi & Hachinski, 2018), as well as the unavailability of biomarkers in poorer regions, may make the reconceptualization of AD practical for only a minority of people. The ethically problematic nature and potential harm of asymptomatic or prodromal AD diagnoses include insurance, driving, and employment implications; additional costs for diagnostics and potentially ineffective treatments; needless worry and hypervigilance; and the stigma of being labeled with an AD diagnosis (Le Couteur, Doust, Creasey, & Brayne, 2013; Milne et al., 2018; Shermer & Richard, 2018; Swallow, 2017). Turning people who may or may not have a disease into patients with a chronic illness (Bedson, McCarney, & Croft, 2004) or patients-in-waiting (Timmermans & Buchbinder, 2010) similarly deserves careful deliberation, whatever the benefits the new research diagnostic criteria may hold. Reconceptualizing AD as various states of risk may help avoid some of these problems, but still can result in a \u201cdiagnosis\u201d of risk, which can be harmful given that interventions to reduce risk can also cause harm (Accad & Fred, 2010).",

Such individuals are at risk of being overdiagnosed because they are unlikely to become symptomatic or have deadly arrhythmias (Quarta et al., 2017).

Although they are correct that AD biomarkers should be sufficiently validated and accurately distinguish between AD dementia and normal aging, AD neuropathology has been shown in a substantial number of brains of people aged less than 30 years (Braak & Del Tredici, 2011; Braak, Thal, Ghebremedhin, & Del Tredici, 2011; although, to be fair, not all such people will necessarily go on to develop AD symptoms in their old age).

Moreover, given AD's phenotypic, endotypic, and etiologic heterogeneity, characterizing the condition as a single disease is likely to lead to research and therapeutic dead-ends, such as with single-therapy solutions (Huang & Mucke, 2012).",

This can conflict with lay intuitions about AD, a point recognized (but perhaps not adequately resolved) by the NIA-AA:\u2026 we also recognize the deeply engrained historic use of the term \u201cAlzheimer\u201d to denote particular syndromes. Thus, we strongly recommend that a clinically ascertained syndrome consistent with what has historically been labeled \u201cprobable or possible AD\u201d be referred to as Alzheimer's clinical syndrome, but not as AD or some modified form of AD (e.g., \u201cpossible or probable AD\u201d).

The result can be earlier diagnosis and more timely, effective interventions. In the case of AKI, for example, \u201c[f]uture definitions [of AKI] are likely to incorporate novel functional and damage biomarkers to characterize AKI better\u201d (Ostermann & Joannidis, 2016, p. 11).",

            "text": "As technology advances, the ability to probe into the pathophysiological defects of many diseases may improve, such that they can be treated, even if asymptomatic and representing just mild dysfunction. Such proactive intervention well ahead of when a person becomes symptomatic may also make it possible to modify the disease process and hopefully avert the development of the disease, or mitigate certain aspects of its presentation. This is now true for rheumatoid arthritis, for which disease-modifying drugs are available. For other diseases, such as atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes, early lifestyle interventions (exercise, diet) have been shown to prevent their development or progression. For diseases in which there are neither cures nor effective treatments, such as Huntington disease, the value of knowing in advance whether one has the disease may be less than for diseases in which therapeutic interventions are available. Indeed, the rate of presymptomatic testing for Huntington disease is very low (Oster, Shoulson, & Dorsey, 2013). Nonetheless, in Huntington disease detectable pathophysiological changes are present one to two decades prior to clinical diagnosis (Paulsen et al., 2008). Research trials aimed at preventive therapeutics can thus still benefit from this lag between the beginning of pathophysiology and the appearance of symptoms. The existence of risk-based conditions\u2014category B\u2014which in some cases medicalize individual variation, could lead to less diagnosis of disease (if recognized as not involving dysfunction), whereas for category C diseases it could lead to more diagnosis (if diagnostic criteria are changed to allow for laboratory evidence of pathology). Understanding the nature of the categories could provide a conceptual toolkit for nosology and the setting of diagnostic criteria. This can lead to approaches that are directly relevant to patients. For example, patients falling within certain categories could be provided direct indicators of disease rather than treating risk factors for disease. Measuring and using carotid artery total plaque area as a guide to therapy, for instance, has been shown to improve therapy in cardiovascular disease prevention clinics (Spence & Hackam, 2010). Similarly, measurement of intima-media thickness affected both physician and patient behaviors, leading to better treatment behaviors (Korcarz et al., 2008). Making visible direct indicators of disease can in a way turn a sign into a symptom (i.e., the feeling engendered by witnessing the sign), with possible effects on an affected patient's motivation now that they can more palpably (or visually) experience a disease they may not yet suffer from.",

There are, however, some limitations. Although the typology can be conceptualized as a framework to help medical researchers, philosophers, bioethicists, and others think through considerations surrounding risk, disease, and the classification of medical conditions, the typology might only make explicit approaches that are already utilized, such as direct application of the notion of risk to classify a condition as a disease or not. The typology has not been empirically tested for its usefulness. Furthermore, the typology is silent on etiology, although it is fully compatible with classification systems that rely on etiology.",

Here the typology may be useful by showing how normative considerations determine whether biological dysfunction or symptoms are more important for a condition's diagnostic criteria. Tensions between the relative importance of the typology's factors for a given condition can result in category reassignment, which can have enormous implications for how a condition is diagnosed, reimbursed by insurance, and viewed by patients. This is especially true when clinicians, patients, or researchers hold implicit biases against certain categories with respect to how conditions falling under those categories should be managed as a class. Further work can clarify the degree to which this is true.",
