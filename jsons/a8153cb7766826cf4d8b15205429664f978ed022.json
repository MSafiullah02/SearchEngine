However, physicians' busy schedules present practical challenges for continuing medical education (CME) to improve medical knowledge and clinical skills. Consider, for example, a community-based physician with limited resources for traveling to an out-of-state conference who must instead rely on traditional forms of learning. As a result, this individual may not be as connected and proficient as colleagues located in large cities [1] .",

            "text": "People around the world are increasingly sharing medical knowledge via the Internet in the wake of COVID-19. To stay connected and to continue learning, online conferences reduce geographic barriers and minimize the effects of social isolation. To expand medical knowledge and advance neurosurgical education, we must better understand the effectiveness and forms of online content delivery. This study points to a consensus that online neurosurgical conferences and training can contribute to closing the gap in global neurosurgical education. Further studies should look deeper into the impact of online neurosurgical education to suggest improvements for neurosurgical educators and all online medical education. In particular, it would be valuable to explore a variety of modalities with which online education reaches neurosurgeons and also how neurosurgeons access that information. ",
