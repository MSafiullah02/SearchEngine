We detail step by step the mechanism by which GP1,2 triggers virus entry. In this part, the aim is to highlight the relationship between structural features and their role in the various phases of the filovirus entry process, with attention to idiosyncrasies within the family Filoviridae.

This family groups highly pathogenic viruses such as those found in the Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus genera (Ascenzi et al., 2008), responsible for severe hemorrhagic fevers, as well as the genus Cuevavirus (Negredo et al., 2011), the latter being found so far only in form of RNA sequenced from bats (Fig. 1\n). The Marburgvirus genus is represented by viruses within a single species, Marburg marburgvirus (Marburg virus - MARV). It was the first filovirus genus and species discovered in 1967 during related outbreaks in Frankfurt (Germany) and Belgrade (Yugoslavia) upon importation of infected monkeys from Uganda to Marburg (Germany) (Siegert et al., 1967). The Ebolavirus genus consists of five virus species. They are known as Zaire ebolavirus (Ebola virus - EBOV), which is the first ebolavirus species identified in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly northern Zaire) near the Ebola River, Sudan ebolavirus (Sudan virus - SUDV), Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus (Ta\u00ef Forest virus - TAFV), Bundibugyo ebolavirus (Bundibugyo virus - BDBV) and Reston ebolavirus (Reston virus - RESTV) according to the new nomenclature (Kuhn et al., 2010). While RESTV has not been described to cause human disease yet, the other species, including MARV, are highly pathogenic with fatality rates ranging from 25% up to 90% (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011). The Cuevavirus genus was established after the discovery of sequences in 2002 most likely belonging to a new filovirus, Lloviu cuevavirus (Lloviu virus - LLOV), presumably infecting bats in Asturias (Spain) (Negredo et al., 2011). Since it is a novel entry in the filovirus phylogeny, only little is known about its biology and putative infectivity in humans.",

Next, hemorrhagic manifestations can arise during the peak of illness. Shock, convulsions, coagulopathy and multi-organ failure appear later and are fatal in many cases (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011, Nina, 2014). Unfortunately, there are no approved antivirals or vaccines available yet, although significant progress has been made lately in this respect (Mendoza et al., 2016), but supportive treatments such as rehydration and control of fever and pain might help patients to overcome infection. Lately, a lot of efforts have been put together to identify key viral targets in order to inhibit the viral cycle and help to cure the infection (Choi and Croyle, 2013).",

            "text": "Filoviruses share a common genomic organization. Their NNS RNA genome of around 19 kb carries seven main genes leading to the synthesis of the different viral proteins (Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n) (Ascenzi et al., 2008). All these proteins are essential to establish an infection leading to efficient virus replication (Fig. 3\n). The sole surface protein GP1,2 triggers the first steps of cell infection, which requires attachment to factors present at the surface of target dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes/macrophages, and on endothelial cells of liver sinusoids and lymph node sinuses. Once attached, the virions are internalized, and endosomal events induce fusion (Feldmann et al., 1999) allowing the release of the viral particle content into the cytoplasm. The nucleocapsid is composed of the genomic RNA in complex with the nucleoprotein NP, the two cofactors VP30 and VP35, and the large protein L, which form a large macromolecular complex protecting the RNA genome and facilitating genome replication/transcription (reviewed by M\u00fchlberger, 2007). The L protein harbors the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity, which is essential for both genome replication and transcription. In addition, this protein carries yet uncharacterized enzymatic activities involved in RNA transcriptional modifications such as RNA capping and polyadenylation, protecting viral mRNA from both degradation and detection by the host cell innate immunity guardians (M\u00fchlberger, 2007, Liang et al., 2015). The nucleoprotein NP enwraps and protects the NNS RNA from host nucleases. The VP30 protein acts as a transcription cofactor, while VP35 is the polymerase cofactor (M\u00fchlberger, 2007). After replication of the viral genome and RNA transcription, nascent viral particles are assembled in a process mediated by the matrix protein VP40, and virus budding occurs at the cell surface membrane in a process that involves hijacking the host ESCRT machinery (Hartlieb and Weissenhorn, 2006, Noda et al., 2006).",

            "text": "The GP gene is the fourth gene along the genome of every filovirus (Sanchez et al., 1993, Negredo et al., 2011). All filovirus GP genes encode a trans-membrane protein GP1,2 localized at the virus surface. In ebolaviruses and presumably in cuevaviruses, unedited and edited transcripts produce several forms of GP, which, together with host furin-dependent proteolysis, lead to the expression of additional proteins: the soluble GP (sGP) described in ebolaviruses and cuevaviruses, the \u0394\u2212peptide, and the small soluble GP (ssGP) (Fig. 4). It has been proposed that this edition mechanism limits the surface GP-associated cytotoxicity (see 5.) (Volchkov et al., 2001, Mohan et al., 2015). The RNA editing of ebolaviruses involves a slippage region composed of seven consecutive template uridines where viral polymerase stuttering results in a frameshift in the middle of the GP sequence (Volchkov et al., 1995, Sanchez et al., 1996, Mehedi et al., 2011). Indeed, this editing mechanism has been recently shown to be regulated by neighboring sequences of the uridine template, probably in synergy with VP30 as a trans-acting factor (Mehedi et al., 2013). Thus, the ebolavirus GP gene is able to generate three different mRNAs coding for protein precursors pre-sGP, pre-GP and ssGP in a ratio of approximately 14:5:1, respectively, albeit the exact ratio is cell type dependent (Fig. 4) (Mehedi et al., 2011).",

            "text": "In ebolaviruses, the most abundant product is the unedited transcript pre-sGP mRNA, which leads to the synthesis of the protein precursor pre-sGP. Remarkably, it is not incorporated into the virion structure per se. This precursor of about 60 kDa is cleaved by cellular proteases of the furin family at the C-terminus of the R-X-R-R\u2193 conserved motif at position 324 (Volchkova et al., 1999). This cleavage forms the final sGP and the \u0394-peptide (Fig. 4). The 40 amino-acid carboxy-terminal \u0394-fragment is subsequently highly modified at the post-translational level (O-glycosylation) before being secreted. Although the \u0394-peptide function has not completely been understood yet, it has been suggested that this peptide regulates filovirus entry since its expression limits infection on filovirus-permissive cells (Radoshitzky et al., 2011). Moreover, based on in silico analysis this peptide was also proposed to act as a virulence factor forming a lytic viroporin, although experimental evidence for such a function is lacking (Gallaher and Garry, 2015). Efforts have been devoted to characterize sGP because it shares its first N-terminal 295 residues with GP1,2 and ssGP (Volchkov et al., 1995). After cleavage, sGP monomers bind to each other in a parallel orientation by means of two disulfide bonds involving residues Cys53 and Cys306 (Falzarano et al., 2006). Due to the lack of a transmembrane domain, sGP forms a soluble dimer, mainly N-glycosylated, of 110 kDa. Its roles have been recently investigated in vitro and in vivo. Indeed, sGP has been suggested as a virulence factor (Volchkova et al., 2015), although currently it is not entirely clear whether or not this is the case, with one study indicating that abolishment of sGP production did not lead to a noticeable attenuation of the virus (Hoenen et al., 2015). However, the fast emergence of revertants both in vivo and in vitro (in certain cell lines) when sGP production is reduced by introducing an 8A genotype (i.e. 8 uridine residues in the virus genome, leading to production of predominantly 8A mRNAs) in the editing site suggests an important role of sGP in the biology of ebolaviruses (Volchkova et al., 2011, Kugelman et al., 2012, Hoenen et al., 2015, Tsuda et al., 2015). In vitro, sGP exerts vascular effects, notably the restoration of the barrier function suggesting an anti-inflammatory role (Wahl-Jensen et al., 2005); however, the relevance of this finding is currently not clear. Also, there is increasing evidence that sGP might reduce viral cytotoxicity by limiting the amount of expressed GP1,2 (see 5.) (Iwasa et al., 2011, Mohan et al., 2015). Finally, it has been shown that secreted sGP might also lead to immune subversion, and act as a decoy for antibodies directed against GP1,2 (Ito et al., 2001, Mohan et al., 2012). However, for all these roles of sGP (reviewed by de La Vega et al., 2015) further investigations are required to ascertain what relevance they really have for ebolavirus biology, and whether this protein represents a potential antiviral target.",

The position of the conserved cleavage site is variable inside the family Filoviridae, but gene structure and functional organization are homologous (Volchkov et al.,, Manicassamy et al., 2007, Maruyama et al., 2014). Indeed, these two proteins together form a trimeric chalice structure made of three GP1 and three GP2 subunits (Fig. 4, Fig. 5\n) assembled by GP1/GP2 and GP2/GP2 interactions (Simmons, 2013). The bowl of the chalice is shaped by the GP1 subunits, while GP2 organizes and anchors the complex to the membrane. In the trimer, GP1,2s are bound to each other by disulfide bonds - between the Cys53 of GP1 and the Cys609 of GP2 as described for ebolaviruses (Lee et al., 2008) - leading to a complex and metastable intricacy.",

This MLD has not been structurally defined yet, but there are slight differences in terms of sequence, length, and position relative to the cleavage site (Volchkov et al., 1995, Sanchez et al., 1996) between different filovirus genera. Indeed, ebolaviruses hold their MLD as a single unit on GP1 whereas marburgviruses and cuevaviruses carry it in two blocks, one in GP1 and the other in GP2. Despite these differences, it has been proposed that this feature plays a common role both in the attachment of the virus via lectins and in immune escape by hiding potential conserved epitopes (Simmons, 2013). Actually, known epitopes targeted by neutralizing anti-ebolavirus antibodies such as KZ52 and 16F6 have been shown to lie in an uncovered domain present at the interface between GP1 and GP2 (Lee et al., 2008, Dias et al., 2011). Similarly, the antibody MR78, which was identified in a marburgvirus disease survivor, targets key residues for receptor binding, which are masked in case of ebolaviruses by the MLD, but more accessible in case of marburgviruses (Hashiguchi et al., 2015). The fact that such a cross-reactive antibody targeting the receptor-binding site (RBS) was found in a marburgvirus disease survivor, but not in ebolavirus disease survivors, is used as a further argument to strengthen the case for a function of the MLD in immune escape.",

Its structure/function complexity has been well described for ebolaviruses (Lee et al., 2008). Briefly, its structure incorporates a transmembrane domain, a short cytoplasmic tail, an internal fusion loop defined by a disulfide bound between GP2 Cys511 and Cys556, and two heptad repeat regions (HRR1 and HRR2) surrounding the fusion peptide. This domain constitutes the unstable pre-fusion conformation of GP2, which rearranges itself at low pH to trigger fusion. To maintain the structure in the pre-fusion state, the GP1 head packs the GP2 hydrophobic fusion peptide and stabilizes GP2. Such features have not been clearly described yet for marburgviruses and cuevaviruses, but sequence alignments and in vitro data suggest similar conformations and entry/fusion mechanisms (Manicassamy et al., 2007, Maruyama et al., 2014, Liu et al., 2015).",

Nevertheless, despite this clearly demonstrated role, only epithelial cells and some antigen-presenting cells subsets significantly express TIM-1 and TIM-4 respectively, suggesting that there are other attachment factors involved in other filovirus-susceptible cell types.

            "text": "After internalization, macropinocytosis vesicles are routed to endosomal vesicles of the host cell, where proteolytic events occur to prime GP1,2 (Fig. 6). Once in the endosome, EBOV GP1,2 is sequentially processed by the cysteine proteases cathepsin B (catB) and/or cathepsin L (catL) under acidic pH and reducing conditions (Chandran et al., 2005, Schornberg et al., 2006, Brecher et al., 2012). Concisely, it appears that, for EBOV, BDBV, and TAFV, catB removes the major part of GP1 (glycan cap and MLD). The proteolytic events are slightly different for SUDV, RESTV, MARV and LLOV, as catB has been shown to be dispensable (Chan et al., 2000, Gnirss et al., 2012, Xia et al., 2012, Maruyama et al., 2014, Ng et al., 2014). It is thought that catL partially removes a part of the GP1 cap and subsequent proteolysis \u2013 by catB, catL and/or other proteases \u2013 results in a smaller GP1 form of less than 20 kDa. With latest structural inputs, further information regarding cathepsin cleavage have become available. Indeed, amongst the minor differences between EBOV and MARV GP1,2, a catB cleavage site identified on EBOV has been shown to be disordered, and thus potentially easily accessible, while in MARV the homologous region is an \u03b1-helix (Hashiguchi et al., 2015). However, there remain open questions regarding filovirus GP proteolysis processing, since other proteases were also proposed to participate to this process. Further, while much of the cathepsin work was done using GP-pseudotyped VSV or retrovirus particles, work with infectious ebolaviruses challenges the importance of cathepsins for the viral life cycle. Particularly, virus replication in vitro as well as in vivo was shown to be independent of catB and catL, and cathepsin knockout mice succumbed to ebolavirus challenge, albeit not to VSV infection (Marzi et al., 2012).",

Recently, the Niemann-Pick C1 protein (NPC1), which is an anchored late endosomal/lysosomal protein physiologically implicated in cholesterol absorption and homeostasis, has been shown to interact with this region of GP1 (Fig. 6) (Carette et al., 2011, C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2011) downstream both attachment and uptake events independently from its proper role in cholesterol trafficking (E. H. Miller et al., 2012, White and Schornberg, 2012). Indeed, the latest structural data define the RBS as a negatively charged crest and a hydrophobic trough at the apex of GP1 trimer that interact mostly with the domain C (loops 1 and 2) and partially with the domain NTD of NPC1 (Bornholdt et al., 2016, Gong et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2016, Zhao et al., 2016). This structural characterization of the NPC1/GP1 interaction provides key information to design promising antiviral strategies. More importantly, further analyses described NPC1 as a crucial receptor that potentially determines the species susceptibility to filoviruses (Ng et al., 2015, Hoffmann et al., 2016, Ndungo et al., 2016), paving the way towards filovirus-specific antiviral molecules (see 6.2.).",

Fusion necessitates large conformation changes representing a high-energy barrier. With GP1 cleavages and a low-pH environment, it is hypothesized that both GP1 constraint removal from the metastable GP2 and histidine protonation generate the energy triggering the fusion events (Kampmann et al., 2006, Lee et al., 2008, Lee et al., 2016, Markosyan et al., 2016). At this point, the disordered HRRs rearrange themselves into \u03b1-helices. These helices push through the host membrane, and then anchor the hydrophobic fusion peptide in target membrane. Within the membrane, key residues, amongst them Pro537, trigger bilayer destabilization with an extended pre-hairpin intermediate conformation (Fig. 6). Therefore, elongated GP2 spans and thus branches both host and viral membranes. The fusion finally occurs by the collapse of this intermediate into a folding-back conformation that distorts both viral and host membranes with their simultaneous rapprochement. GP2 acts as a clamp to reach its low energy state characterized as a six helices bundle, which is the GP2 hairpin post-fusion structure (Fig. 6). This novel conformation leads to a merge into a hemi-fusion stalk and then to the opening of a fusion pore allowing the release of the nucleocapsid into the host cytoplasm (Fig. 6).",

Cellular GP1,2-related cytotoxic events occur in infected cells. This cytotoxicity is reflected in rounding of cells in vitro, due to masking of various host cell surface molecules such as \u03b21-integrins (Takada et al., 2000, Francica et al., 2009). This masking has been shown to be a \u201cglycan umbrella\u201d mediated steric shielding of these adhesion proteins mediated by surface-expressed GP1,2, leading to a loss of accessibility and function of these host surface proteins (Reynard et al., 2009, Francica et al., 2010). The masking of such adhesion molecules leads to cell detachment, and may contribute to the disruption of blood vessel integrity and hemorrhages developed during a filovirus infection. Indeed, in primary endothelial cell cultures overexpression of GP1,2 after transduction with an adenovirus vector resulted in a loss of adherence resulting in apoptosis (Ray et al., 2003). Additionally, steric shielding by GP1,2 also affects MHC-I surface expression (Francica et al., 2009), a phenomenon also known to occur in infected primary endothelial cells (Harcourt et al., 1999). This might alter immune cells recruitment, and thus may participate in the immune suppression and inflammatory dysfunction linked to a filovirus infection (Harcourt et al., 1999, Reynard et al., 2009).",

However, when this EBOV is further passaged in animals or in other cell lines like Huh7 cells, the genotype reverts back so that sGP is again produced as the main product of transcription (Volchkova et al., 2011, Hoenen et al., 2015, Tsuda et al., 2015).

Another example is griffithsin, a lectin of terminal mannose residues of asparagine (N)-linked Man 5-9 GlcNAc2 structures purified from red-algae, which might also have antiviral potential since these carbohydrate residues are found on HIV-1 and 2, HCV, SARS-CoV and, relevant to our discussion, on ebolaviruses (Barton et al., 2014). Similarly, recombinant human mannose binding lectin has been shown in a mouse model to be protective against ebolaviruses (Michelow et al., 2011); however, the mouse model, while a necessary and important early step in drug evaluation for ebolaviruses, has only limited predictive value regarding the effectivity of a treatment in other, more stringent animal models of EVD, or even human patients.",

Several compounds have been described targeting NPC1, such as U18666A, imipramine, cathionic amphiphiles Ro48-8071 and the terconazole adamantane class of compounds like benzylpiperazine adamantane diamides 3.47 and 3.0, or the lately discovered sulfonamide derivative MBX2254 and the triazole thioether derivative MBX2270 (Rodriguez-Lafrasse et al., 1990, Cenedella, 2009, C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2011, Lee et al., 2013, Shoemaker et al., 2013, Basu et al., 2015). Most of these inhibitors helped to identify NPC1 as a critical factor for filovirus entry. Interestingly, the tertiary amine imipramine inhibits both NPC1 and sphingomyelinase, resulting in ebolavirus entry inhibition (M.E. Miller et al., 2012). As NPC1 is involved in other cellular functions, its inhibition disrupts its primary role in cholesterol homeostasis and triggers cholesterol accumulation in endosomes, as is the case in Niemann-Pick disease type C (Lee et al., 2013, Shoemaker et al., 2013). Therefore, further development might be required to uncouple the NPC1 function in cholesterol traffic from its implication in filovirus entry. This unbundling should be tricky, since both cholesterol management and ebolavirus binding are facilitated by the same domains of NPC1. However, as ebolavirus disease constitutes an acute infection, it should be possible to keep the treatment time relatively short, so that this side effect might have limited detrimental effects in practice.",

Indeed, a benzodiazepine derivative (referred to as compound 7) has been shown - by computer calculation and mutagenesis - to mask the hydrophobic conserved S2 pocket defined at the GP1/GP2 interface, inhibiting ebolavirus replication (Basu et al., 2011). These results also show that this S2 pocket does not correspond to the trough of the RBS, suggesting that it might be another binding site or a steric regulation region of the NCP1 binding site.

GP genes are roughly similar for ebolaviruses, marburgviruses, and cuevoviruses, with the notable exception that the marburgvirus GP gene does not undergo transcriptional editing, but only encodes GP0. The ebolavirus GP gene, like the cuevovirus GP gene, contains a poly-U repeat (stuttering region, SR), facilitating an editing mechanism that results in the synthesis of three different mRNAs, leading to the synthesis of sGP (shown on the left), GP0 (shown in the center), and ssGP (shown on the right). All these mRNAs contain a signal sequence (SS) and the coding sequence for the different proteins. They share a common 5\u2032 sequence (grey) leading to an identical amino-terminus for all GP-proteins. mRNAs are translated into pre-proteins transiting through the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. During this intracellular trafficking, the signal peptide (SP) is removed; the protein is glycosylated (N- and O-glycosylations), and GP0 matures by cleavage by furin-like proteases in GP1 (red) and GP2 (green). The mucin-like domain is part of GP1 (red) for ebolaviruses, whereas for marburgviruses and cuevoviruses it is part of both GP1 and GP2. Together, GP1 and GP2 form GP1,2, which assembles further into trimers. The surface GP1,2 can shed as a soluble trimer upon cleavage by the host TNF\u03b1-converting enzyme (TACE). Three other proteins, sGP (blue), the \u0394-peptide (purple), and ssGP (yellow) are synthetized by ebolaviruses, and presumably also by cuevoviruses.",

Surface GP1,2 (PDB: 3CSY) is a trimer composed of three dimers of GP1 (red) and GP2 (green), forming a chalice at the viral envelope. The left panel presents a surface representation of the three-dimensional structure of ebolavirus GP1,2, and GP1 and GP2 are shown in red and green, respectively. The right panel highlights the conserved residues (from dark red to light red or dark green to light green according to their conservation) derived from a sequence alignment of every filovirus species using hierarchical clustering (MultiAlin server). The figure shows that conserved residues are localized at the center of the trimeric complex (indicated with a grey dotted circle), which contains all features for priming and fusion, as well as in the external domain targeted by the cross-genus neutralizing antibody MR78.",

After attachment mediated by interaction between the filovirus surface protein GP1,2 (PDB: 3CSY) and various attachment factors, the complex is internalized and routed to the endosome, where GP1,2 is processed to trigger fusion of viral and host membranes. First, in the endosomal low pH environment, cathepsin proteases L&B (catL & catB) and others remove the mucin-like region (MLD) and the glycan cap (GC) domain of GP1 (red). A receptor binding domain (RDB), also carried by GP1, is unmasked, leading to the interaction with a mainly hydrophobic pocket in the N-terminal domain (blue) of the endosomal protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) (PDB: 5F1B). This interaction together with other only partially understood molecular events remove GP1 constraints on GP2 (green), forming the primed-GP1,2 capable to induce fusion. The GP2 heptad repeat regions 1 and 2 (HRR1 and HRR2) then rearrange themselves, pushing out the fusion peptide (pink) to anchor it in the host membrane. This intermediate pre-hairpin conformation destabilizes membrane bilayers, and a folding-back into a six-bundle helices conformation (PDB: 2EBO) merges membranes, opening a fusion pore for the release of viral nucleocapsids.",
