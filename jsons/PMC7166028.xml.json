A 2009 American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons\u2013sponsored survey with 953 respondents evaluated the effects of the recession on surgical and patient volume, practice type, hospital relationships, cost control mechanisms, Medicare reimbursement, attitudes toward health care reform and retirement. The report found that surgeons lost almost 30% of their retirement savings during the economic downturn of 2008, surgeons planned to retire at an older age, and surgical and patient volume decreased by 30.4% and 29.3%, respectively [19]. It is certain that in the short term, the COVID-19 crisis will have a similar outcome as the Great Recession of 2008, temporarily slowing the demand for TJA.",

The economic effects of COVID-19 may burden surgeons with debt caused by high overhead costs not offset by clinical revenue, causing surgeons to seek more financially stable positions within large health care organizations. Health care systems will further be impacted as the rate of patients with commercial insurance coverage will decrease as the rate of unemployment increases. After the Great Recession, from 2009 to 2011, the decrease in inpatient admissions from patients with commercial insurance resulted in an average loss of $3.7 million for a 300-bed hospital [20]. At the end of the COVID-19 crisis, unemployment is projected to be up to three times that of the Great Recession. The loss of revenue due to the lack of commercial insurance after the COVID-19 crisis will far exceed that felt during the Great Recession. A rapid reversal in the economy is possible; however, much of this depends on how long state and federal restrictions are enforced, and how soon effective testing is implemented [6]. Many financially troubled hospitals and health care systems may need to be absorbed by financially healthier systems further decreasing patient, payor, and surgeon choice and thus narrowing the health care market further and continuing the consolidation which began in 2008.",

After the Great Recession of 2008, demand for elective surgery was decreased because patients had to work, they could not afford time to schedule hip and knee procedures, and many patients lost health insurance. After the COVID-19 crisis, patients will have the same economic, employment, and insurance concerns, but patients may also be concerned about the risk of entering a health care facility. It is likely that the demand surge we anticipate may be lower than expected. Older patients may be reluctant to undergo procedures while the pandemic simmers and their risk of infection is high. Younger patients may not be able to delay work for long periods to recover or may have insurance issues.",

TJA candidates with substantial risk factors before surgery need to be optimized to ensure high-quality outcomes while reducing resource expenditures [22]. In addition, elective TJA candidates with nonmodifiable risk factors who may need ICU beds or blood transfusions should be delayed if that community has increased COVID-19 demand. Postoperative complications that lead to in hospital readmission for TJA patients can lead to excessive resource utilization adversely impacting the care of COVID-19 patients.

The psychological barriers (eg, pain and ambulation) preventing eligible TJA candidates from considering early discharge and outpatient TJA will likely be less relevant as patients attempt to distance themselves from exposure to COVID-19. It will be the orthopedic surgeon\u2019s responsibility to ensure that strict patient selection and screening be performed before surgery at hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). Patients not meeting the selection criteria for early discharge can instead be enrolled in rapid recovery programs at a regional hospital with minimal COVID-19 exposure. Adherence to strict patient selection protocols will allow high-quality clinical outcomes, while limiting complications and unnecessary expenditures and exposures.",

Eliminating the increased out-of-pocket expenditures for Medicare patients would be a helpful measure to assist in expediting the safe care of our elderly, high-risk patients. Extending HOPD and ASC hours of operation and potentially operating on weekends presents another opportunity for orthopedic practices to meet the increased need for outpatient and early discharge TJA. Large private orthopedic groups or health care systems invested in HOPDs and ASCs will profit from the increased case load, whereas those who do not have access to ASC, HOPD, or rapid recovery TJA programs may see a decrease in patient volume.",

            "text": "Perhaps one of the biggest benefits of the COVID-19 crisis has been the robust implementation of telemedicine and virtual visits. Surgeon concerns about reimbursement, privacy, and billing have been partially resolved as a result of the pandemic. Orthopedic surgeon practices in Massachusetts have already begun evaluating the safety and effectiveness of virtual visits during the 90-day global period [24]. During the COVID-19 crisis, it is not a requirement for practices to use HIPPA compliant technology options; however, it is likely that in the future when telemedicine is used for routine postoperative visits, the use of HIPPA compliant technology will be necessary. The planning and implementation of telemedicine platforms will be expensive and depends on a number of factors such as education and training, number of providers and patients, compatible devices and security costs and concerns. Traditional capital expenditure purchase models for telemedicine platforms start at about $42,000; however, newer more affordable options include per physician fees that start at around $799 per month [25]. It is evident that the days of routine postoperative visits are fading and will be replaced with telemedicine. Virtual visits provide the orthopedic surgeon with an opportunity to increase office efficacy and cost-effectiveness in an era of decreasing reimbursements and increasing time constraints. New patient screening and long-term post-operative surveillance of TJA patients are also good applications for telemedicine and virtual visits.",

It is well-documented that implant cost is the main driver of inpatient costs for TJA [26]. The renegotiation of contracts with vendors to decrease implant costs may help reduce the expenses for TJA. The use of specialized hospital physician negotiating committees may increase bargaining power and drive down costs [27]. Orthopedic practices and health care systems should also assess the possibility of renegotiating terms on office space and imaging equipment (e.g. MRI, CT) with the aim of reducing overhead expenditures. Landlords and bankers may be willing to write-off short-term losses in the hope of retaining a long-term client. Value-added technologies which drive up TJA costs need to be reconsidered or renegotiated. Robotics, navigation systems, custom implants, radiofrequency sealant devices, and other nonessential parts of arthroplasty care can be eliminated in this time of economic hardship to minimize hospital cost. Reducing the fixed costs associated with TJA will improve financial performance and mitigate the losses associated with the COVID-19 crisis as demonstrated in Table 1\nand Figure 2\n.",
