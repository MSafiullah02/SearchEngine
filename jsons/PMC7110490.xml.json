The adaptive component is organised around two classes of specialised lymphocytes, T cells and B cells, each of which display an unique receptor with a specific antigen, leading to a large and diverse repertoire of antigen receptors within the T/B cell population. This diversity is necessary to ensure that each individual cell can encounter its specific antigen, thus inducing activation, maturation and proliferation of the cell. This process, called clonal expansion, forms the basis of the function of the adaptive immune system. Whereas clonal expansion is crucial in dealing with an invading pathogen, the process itself is relatively slow, taking days before enough effector cells and their products can be produced. This delay provides the majority of invading pathogens with time to attach, invade and successfully replicate within the host.",

In the adaptive immune system, T cell and B cell receptors are generated during their development by somatic recombination. This equips each cell with a structurally unique receptor, leading to an extremely diverse and randomly generated receptor repertoire. Cells expressing a fitting, antigen-specific receptor are subsequently multiplied by clonal expansion. The downside of this system, however, is that receptors have to be developed within an individual and, no matter how useful they are, they have to be developed over and over again in subsequent cell generations, as these receptors are not encoded in the germ line.",

Activation of the adaptive immune response can be harmful to the host when the antigens are self or environmental antigens, since immune responses to such antigens can lead to autoimmune diseases and allergies. How does the immune system determine the origin of the antigen and subsequently decide whether to induce an immune response? Recent studies demonstrate that the innate immune system plays a major role in these decisions.",

Innate immune recognition, as stated above, is mediated by germ line-encoded receptors, which means that the specificity of each receptor is genetically predetermined. One advantage of this is that innate immune receptors evolved by natural selection to have defined specificities for infectious microorganisms. The problem, however, is that every organism has a limit to the number of genes it can encode in its genome. The human genome, for example, contains only 75,000\u2013100,000 genes, most of which have nothing to do with immune recognition. In comparison, there are approximately 1014 and 1018 different somatically generated immunoglobulin receptors and T cell receptors, respectively. The total number of receptors involved in innate immune recognition is thought to be in the hundreds. Moreover, microorganisms are extremely versatile and can mutate at a much higher rate than any of their hosts.",

These structures are referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and the receptors of the innate immune system that have evolved to recognise them are called pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). The best-known examples of PAMPs are bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), mannans, bacterial DNA, double-stranded RNA and glucans. Although these structures are chemically quite distinct, all PAMPs have common features. PAMPs are produced only by microbial pathogens and not by their hosts. They are usually invariant structures shared by entire classes of pathogens. For example, all Gram-positive bacteria have LTA and, therefore, the LTA-PRRs of the host can detect the presence of virtually any Gram-positive bacterial infection. The structures recognised by the innate immune system are usually essential for the survival or pathogenicity of microorganisms.",

            "text": "Although the exact function of DEC205 is not known, it is thought to play a role in the capture, phagocytosis and subsequent processing and presenting of antigens (Jiang et al., 1995). Previous studies have identified a 210 kDa molecular weight molecule expressed at a high level on the surface of DCs in bovine afferent lymph and evident on cells with the morphology of DCs in lymphoid tissues (Howard et al., 1996). Expression in other immune cells is either absent or present at a lower level. The cDNA sequence of the bovine orthologue, originally termed WC6, shares 86% and 78% nucleic acid identity with human and mouse DEC205, respectively. COS-7 cells transfected with a plasmid containing the bovine DEC205 coding region expressed a molecule that stained with a WC6-specific monoclonal antibody (Gliddon et al., 2004). Two-colour flow cytometry of bovine mononuclear cells from afferent lymph draining skin and from blood, confirmed the high level of expression of DEC205 (WC6) on large cells in lymph that were uniformly positive for DC-lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein (DC-LAMP) and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II). Within this DEC205+ DC-LAMP+ population were subpopulations of cells that expressed the macrophage-MR or CD172a, implying that DCs in afferent lymph all express this CTLR but, within this population, different subsets with potentially different functions may be present (Gliddon et al., 2004).",

Furthermore, low bovine dectin-1 expression was consistently observed in NK cells. Interestingly, in all samples analysed, independent regulation of both dectin-1 isoforms was never detected. In contrast with murine dectin-2 mRNA, the recently identified bovine dectin-2 is abundantly expressed by Langerhans\u2019 cells compared to macrophages (Bonkobara et al., 2006). The highest expression of dectin-2 mRNA was detected in lymph node samples, while the spleen and lung had the highest levels of expression of mouse and human dectin-2 (Bonkobara et al., 2006, Willcocks et al., 2006).

            "text": "The macrophage-MR is a type I membrane protein predominantly expressed by macrophages and non-vascular endothelial cells. It is a constantly recycling endocytic receptor, containing eight CRDs which mediate recognition of terminal mannose/fucose-linked N-acetyl glucosamine and sulphated-N-acetylgalactosamine via their cysteine-rich domains. Macrophage-MR has been implicated in the recognition of numerous microbial pathogens, including Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, Leishmania spp. and HIV (Gordon, 1998, Linehan et al., 2000). Functional characterisation of the putative bovine macrophage-MR (GenBank NM_175779) showed that this receptor is involved in mannosyl-rich glycoprotein-induced mitogenesis in bovine airway smooth muscle cells and the uptake of dextran into monocyte-derived DC (Lew et al., 1994, Werling et al., 1999). More recently, both cytopathic and non-cytopathic types of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) were shown to affect the mechanisms of antigen uptake by monocytes. Endocytosis in BVDV-infected monocytes, unlike uninfected cells, was MR-independent and mediated by fluid phase uptake after 1 h of infection, but became MR- and fluid phase uptake-dependent after 24 h of infection, independent of the BVDV biotypes (Boyd et al., 2004). Thus, by influencing the early antigen uptake function of APCs, BVDV might disrupt the function of monocytes as professional APCs and contribute to specific immunotolerance to BVDV (Boyd et al., 2004). Interestingly, a variety of recent publications indicate that CTLRs collaborate with TLRs in the recognition and uptake of pathogens, as well as the induction of the innate immune response (Underhill, 2003).",

In addition, chickens possess two types of TLR2 (types 1 and 2), which appear to be generated by gene-duplication and may represent homologues to human TLRs 2 and 4, whereas the TLR8 gene is disrupted. TLR15 (GenBank DQ267901) has no known orthologue in other species and is thought to be an avian-specific TLR (Higgs et al., 2006). A putative chicken TLR6 (GenBank XM428184) has been predicted from the genome sequence. However, sequence analysis suggests that this is not accurate and may be a misassembled part of the genome.",

At the cellular level, activation of chicken TLRs expressed on heterophils and monocytes/macrophages activated NF\u03baB, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), resulting in the production of nitric oxide (NO), pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Farnell et al., 2003a, Farnell et al., 2003b, Farnell et al., 2003c, He et al., 2006, Kogut et al., 2005a, Kogut et al., 2005b). In addition, allelic variations in TLR4 (Leveque et al., 2003) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MD2 gene are linked to susceptibility to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection in chicken and bacterial load in the spleen, respectively (Leveque et al., 2003, Malek et al., 2004). In addition to these allelic variations, different chicken strains seem to be able to mount a stronger or weaker TLR-dependent immune response to bacterial LPS (Dil and Qureshi, 2002a, Dil and Qureshi, 2002b).",

Expression of these TLRs has been monitored in selected bovine tissues (Menzies and Ingham, 2006), as well as in subsets of bovine APCs (Werling et al., 2006). Based on these data, it is evident that the majority of tissues/cells analysed so far do express TLRs. However, the expression pattern varies between tissues, between cell subsets within cattle and the TLR repertoire varies in different tissues/cells compared to those analysed from other species, such as mice and humans. Several SNPs have already been identified in bovine TLRs between different breeds (White et al., 2003a, White et al., 2003b).

Surprisingly, BVDV-infection of macrophages resulted in a modulated NO response when cells were stimulated with TLR2 or TLR4 ligands, suggesting that viral infection may modulate TLR-function without inducing differences in expression of mRNA transcripts (Franchini et al., 2006). This observation may become even more important when looking at different APC subsets (Werling et al., 2004) or in cells isolated from animals exposed to stress or growth hormones (Eicher et al., 2004). However, whether differential expression of TLR mRNA is based on the interaction of a ligand with the TLR, or whether these effects are just a \u201cside-effect\u201d based on cellular stress in general, requires further study. One approach is to analyse the expression of bovine TLRs in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, a cell line devoid of some TLRs, allowing direct analysis of TLR-ligand interaction by gene reporter assays or chemokine production. Recently, this has been used successfully to study activation of NF\u03baB by bovine TLRs (Yang et al., 2006).",

Analysis of canine TLR cDNA in a variety of tissues by RT-PCR revealed differences in the pattern of expression. Furthermore, the response of canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells to LTA, a TLR2-ligand, induced CXCL-8 secretion by these cells (Bazzocchi et al., 2005). However, further analysis of the published canine TLR 2 and 4 sequences has suggested that they are not full length as claimed (Catchpole and House, personal communication). Expression of feline TLRs 1\u20139, as analysed by quantitative PCR, found expression of these TLRs in all cell types analysed (Ignacio et al., 2005). The level of expression of each TLR varied between tissues and expression was further affected by infection with feline immunodeficiency virus (Ignacio et al., 2005). Similarly, the U3-long terminal repeat of feline leukaemia virus was recently shown to activate NF\u03baB via a TLR3-dependent mechanism (Abujamra et al., 2006).",

Secondly, the set of PRRs expressed varies among different cells, resulting in a PRR repertoire that is different for each cell type of the immune system. Thirdly, changes in PRR cell-surface distribution adds yet another level of complexity, modulating binding of PAMPs to certain carbohydrate moieties and thus regulating the affinity for different ligands. Finally, these receptors have been shown to interact with each other, thereby giving rise to a network of multimolecular complexes that add an extra level of complexity to pathogen recognition.",

Even more importantly, knowledge about the functions of these receptors, their ligands, and subsequent gene-activation after receptor\u2013ligand interaction may lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches by interfering at three points in the PRR activation cascade. Ligands can be used as adjuvants, providing the first point to regulate PRR activation. Secondly, modulation of PRR activity can be achieved by the addition of soluble forms of PRRs or PRR-blocking molecules. Finally, PRR signalling can be positively regulated by the adapters or negatively regulated by their inhibitors. Recent findings suggest that there are small synthetic molecules that block TLR-adapter interaction (Ii et al., 2006).
