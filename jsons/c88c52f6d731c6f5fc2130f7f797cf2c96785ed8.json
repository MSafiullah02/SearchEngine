From summer 2014, there was a rapid escalation with spreading to towns and cities ( Fig. 88.1) [21, 28, 32] . Not before 8 August 2014, the WHO declared that the Ebola outbreak was a \"public health emergency of international concern\" (PHEIC) [28, 32] . The epidemic reached its peak 14 September 2014. [21, 28, 32] WHO, CDC and the United Kingdom established springtime 2014 guidelines for contact and droplets in a radius of 1 m from the Ebola patient [21, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Outside the 1-m zone, personal protective equipment-PPE-was usually unnecessary, see Table 88 .1. The spread of Ebola disease and death among many patients, including many healthcare professionals, was observed despite following WHO and CDC's guidelines [26, 28] . In 20 October 2014, CDC changed its routines for the use of PPE, focused more on training in donning and doffing PPE in sluices, use of head and neck coverings, use of P3 mask and observation of and check by a dedicated person that this work properly [33] . Healthcare staff underwent proper training in the use of PPE and other infection control measures before being sent out in the field. From January 2015, WHO also changed its schedule, but still with regular mask, with the exception of aerosol-generating procedures and still \"within a meter of the patient\" [34] . It is discussed whether Ebola infects via air or not; important for infection control measures [21, 28, 32] . Earlier studies have warned that air transmission cannot be excluded, as shown in animal experiments [9, 11, 16, [23] [24] [25] 35] . Based on high risk of fatal progression, preventive measures are better than belated wisdom. However, in April 2015, CDC and WHO still postulated that \"Ebola is not spread through air, water or food\". Since the Ebola virus may occur in large quantities in saliva and tears and mucous membranes during disease, studies generally show that drops from cough and sneezing may spread up to 9 m away [36] .",
