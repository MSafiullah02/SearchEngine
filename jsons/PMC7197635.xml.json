With regard to COVID-19, recent studies also found decreases in lymphocyte numbers and increases in serum inflammatory cytokine levels in peripheral blood5,14. However, the manner in which key immune cell subsets change and their states during COVID-19 have remained largely unclear. Thus, defining these key cellular subsets and their states in COVID-19 is a crucial step in obtaining critical insights into the immune clearance mechanism and developing new therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.",

Our study depicted a high-resolution transcriptome landscape of blood immune cell subsets during the recovery stage of COVID-19. It revealed that, compared to that in the healthy controls (HCs), monocytes containing high inflammatory gene expression and IL1\u03b2+ subsets predominated, whereas CD4+ T cells decreased remarkably in patients in the early recovery stage of COVID-19. We found that T and B cell clones were highly expanded during the recovery stage in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, several specific BCR changes in COVID-19 patients during the recovery stage may be helpful for vaccine and antibody production.",

We also collected scRNA-seq data (57,238 cells) from five healthy donors as controls (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1a\u2013c). This dataset passed stringent high-quality filtering. Single-cell suspensions of the scRNA-seq samples were converted to barcoded scRNA-seq libraries using 10x Genomics.

The sketchy clustering analysis landscape of each subject is presented in Supplementary Fig. S2a, and the merged image of each group is shown in Fig. 2a. We discovered that COVID-19 patients, including ERS and LRS, demonstrated a higher proportion of myeloid cells compared to the HCs, but with a lower proportion of NK and T cells (Fig. 2b, c). Interestingly, LRS patients had more B cells and NK and T cells, but less myeloid cells, than the ERS patients (Fig. 2b, c).

In contrast, anti-inflammatory genes associated with CD14++ monocytes (M1) were downregulated in COVID-19 patients relative to that in the HCs (Fig. 3d, e). Notably, IL1\u03b2 expression values in a UMAP with simultaneous contrast indicated that IL1\u03b2 was upregulated in the ERS group and decreased in the LRS patients (Fig. 3f). This was also confirmed in the DC cluster of the ERS group compared to that of the HCs (Supplementary Fig. S3a, b). Next, we took the average of the inflammatory genes for each myeloid cell scRNA-seq subset in the COVID-19 patients versus that in the HCs (Supplementary Fig. S3c). These results demonstrated that cytokine activation drives the expansion of monocyte populations (especially CD14++ inflammatory monocytes) in COVID-19-infected patients. To explore the biological significance of the transcriptional changes in the M1 cluster, we performed GO analysis with DEGs (Fig. 3g). We observed enrichment of the pathways related to cytokine signaling and inflammation activation, which were driven by the upregulation of IFITM3 and IFI6 and IL1\u03b2, JUN, FOS, JUNB, and KLF6 (Fig. 3g).",

We also found similar results in the plasma cells, the antibody-secreting cells (ASC) (Supplementary Fig. S5b, c), suggesting a key role for ASC in viral control. Next, we took the average of the inflammatory genes for each B cell subset of the COVID-19 patients versus the normal RNA-seq data (Fig. 5e). The difference in the genes between the ERS and HCs indicated enhanced B cell reaction and antibody secretion in COVID-19 patients. GO analysis revealed that IGHA1, XBP1, MZB1, JUN, POLR2L, and ZFP36 were overpresented in MPBs, which suggests enhanced B cell proliferation and viral transcription in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 5f). Single-cell BCR-seq analysis indicated that the IgA isotype was over-represented in COVID-19 patients compared to that in the HC (Fig. 5g). This corresponded with an increase in the levels of serum IgA, which was also pronounced in other coronavirus infections. Moreover, the ratio of (IgA+IgG+IgE) to (IgD+IgM) increased significantly in the ERS patients and showed a downward trend with recovery time (Fig. 5h).",

At the individual level, we found that COVID-19 patients had significantly expanded clones compared to that in the HCs, supporting the assumption that B cells had experienced unique clonal VDJ rearrangements under SARS-CoV-2-infection. We also found that a higher B cell clonality consistently remained in the ERS compared with that in the LRS patients (Fig. 6b). Moreover, quantification of the most highly expanded (maximum) clone for each subject showed that the ratios of the maximum clones were higher in the ERS group than in the HCs (Fig. 6c). To understand the functional status of expanded cloned B cells, we performed DEG analysis between the cloned memory B cells and the other B cells. Our results revealed increased expression of B cell genes, including CD27, SSR4, IGHG1, MZB1, and XBP1, which further supports the superior effector functions of the expanded cloned B cells (Fig. 6d). Moreover, the differential genes for expanded B cells significantly subsided over time and reduced in LRS patients (Fig. 6d).",

In ERS COVID-19 patients, we found adaptive signals involved in monocyte activation, proliferation, and inflammatory signaling (Fig. 7a, b). T cells expressed genes encoding ligands of TNFSF8, LTA, IFNG, IL17A, CCR5, and LTB to TNFRSF8, TNFRSF1A/TNFRSF14, IFNGR1, IL-17RA, CCR1, and LTBR, which were expressed on monocytes and could contribute to the pro-inflammatory status. Other T cell-monocyte interactions involved the expression of CSF2 and CSF1. T cells might activate monocytes through the expression of CSF2 and CSF1, which bind to CSFRs (CSFR2/1) and contribute to inflammatory storm. A cluster of CD14+ monocytes exclusively expressed IL1\u03b2, which was predicted to bind to IL1RAP expressed by T cells. T cell-monocyte interaction may enhance immune response and be exclusive to COVID-19 patients (Fig. 7a, b). Furthermore, we found that monocytes highly expressed the poliovirus receptor, which serves as a cellular receptor for poliovirus in the first step of poliovirus replication and induction of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. From the B cell-monocyte and B cell-T cell interactions, we found that B cells could secrete a large number of IL-6, LTA, and LTB, which are combined with IL-6R, LTAR, and LTBR expressed in monocytes, and a large amount of IL-6 was applied to T cells to promote the secretion of IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, and other inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Thus, a cascade signature of inflammatory monocytes with high expression of IL-6 and their progeny were formed in the peak incidence of ERS COVID-19 patients (Fig. 7c). These activated immune cells may enter the circulation in the lung and other organs in large numbers and play an immune-damaging role. In LRS COVID-19 patients, DC ligands were predicted to interact with B and T cell receptors involved in cell proliferation and the production of antibodies. We discovered that the peripheral blood of LRS patients contains a diversity of antibodies; we found that IL18-IL18RAP, TNFSF13-TNFRSF13B, TNFSF13-TNFRSF17, TNFSF13B-TNFRSF17, TNFSF13B-TNFRSF13B, and TNFSF13B-TNFRSF13C were highly expressed in our analysis of DC-B cell interaction (Fig. 7d). Thus, we speculate that DCs produce IL-18, TNFSF13, and TNFSF13B to promote the proliferation of B cells and then secrete many antibodies into the blood in ERS. From the DC-T and T cell-B cell interactions, we discovered that DCs produce not only IL-18 but also IL-7 to promote the proliferation of T cells; moreover, T cells produce IL-2 to promote the proliferation and antibodies production of B cells (Fig. 7d). Thus, cell-to-cell interactions help us to understand why COVID-19 patients manifested high rates of monocytes and low rates of lymphocytes and why the proportion of lymphocytes gradually increased in the peripheral blood of recovering patients.",

This has been similarly observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and influenza infections12,14. In viral infection, it is generally accepted that host immune responses determine both protection against viral infections and the pathogenesis of respiratory injury18,19. A coordinated response in innate and adaptive immune cells working in concert may lead to the rapid control of the virus, whereas a failed immune response might lead to viral spreading, cytokine storm, and a high mortality rate20. Despite belonging to same group of viruses, recent studies have highlighted differences between COVID-19, SARS, and MERS, such as the speed of transmission, treatment scheme, and mortality rate. Moreover, this difference may also exist in the key immune players and the underlying molecular mechanisms related to these diseases. The lack of knowledge regarding the immune impact of COVID-19 has now become a critical issue in view of its rapid spread and the shortage of specific therapy21. Using single-cell sequencing, we profiled the complexity of immune populations in the blood and analyzed 70,858 cells from 10 patients. We identified a hyper-inflammatory response in ERS patients, which may explain why some patients fell sick after being discharged, and suggest that the current criteria for hospital discharge should be re-evaluated. In addition, we identified unique signatures of myeloid, NK and T, and B cells and pinpointed the changes in the epitopes of TCR and BCR. Our findings helped elucidate the antiviral immune mechanisms and revealed promising opportunities for developing immunotherapies using vaccines and neutralizing antibodies.",

Among the various inflammatory cells, monocytes and their subsets (including classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes) may play a critical role because they are known to fuel inflammation24\u201327. In our study, compared with the HCs, ERS patients demonstrated a significantly higher ratio of monocytes, and these cells expressed higher levels of inflammatory genes. Intriguingly, the ratio of classical CD14+ monocytes was high in ERS but remained normal in LRS. Furthermore, CD14+IL1\u03b2 monocytes, which were absent in HCs, could be observed in ERS, and they declined in number in LRS. Notably, our cell-to-cell interaction analysis indicated that IL1\u03b2, CSF1, IL6, and CSF2 may be associated with cytokine storm. The CD14++IL1\u03b2 subpopulation appeared to be part of the inflammatory landscape of COVID-19, since these cells increased in ERS stage. Virus-induced IL-1\u03b2 production in monocytes is mediated via a caspase-1 pathway. Multiple microbial components, including viral RNA, are thought to trigger assembly of the inflammasome and consequent caspase-1 activation28, which may give a reasonable explanation for the presence of IL1\u03b2+ monocytes in ERS patients. Previous studies with a pathogenic influenza A virus revealed impaired neutrophil and CD4+ T cell activation in IL-1R1\u2212/\u2212 mice, greatly diminished lung inflammatory infiltrates, reduced IgM levels in both serum and at mucosal sites and decreased activation of CD4+ T \u201chelpers\u201d in secondary lymphoid tissue29, indicating IL1\u03b2 is responsible for virus-induced lung immunopathology establishment. CD14+ IL1\u03b2 is also expected to become an important detection marker for monitoring COVID-19 disease recovery. Collectively, our data provide important insights into the role of monocytes in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19.",

            "text": "The adaptive immune system harbors the ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens through antibody and T cell responses30. Inducing adaptive immunity is the aim of vaccination31. Previous SARS studies have identified binding and neutralizing antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV infection. Their therapeutic effect is unclear32, although robust antibody responses could be induced33. In COVID-19 infection, although several lines of evidence have consistently indicated a decline in lymphocyte counts, the distinct immune characteristics at single-cell resolution are unclear. Irani thevarajan et al.34 reported that in the blood of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 hospitalized patients, the antibody-secreting cells, follicular T-helper cells, activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and IgM/IgG SARS-CoV-2-binding antibodies were increased by using flow cytometry, and they found the changes persisted for at least 7 days following full resolution of symptoms. Our scRNA-seq analysis showed that, compared with the HCs, ERS patients who recovered less than 7 days have a lower ratio of T and NK cells, and these patients\u2019 T cells express higher levels of inflammatory genes, such as JUN, FOS, JUNB, and KLF6. Several studies have reported that lymphopenia is a prominent part of SARS-CoV2 infection and lymphocyte counts are useful in predicting the severity and clinical outcomes35\u201337. We found the number of NK and T cell decreased but no significant change in B cell in COVID-19 patients especially in ERS patients. Possible reasons for it may be the direct infection of lymphocytes by SARS-CoV2, cytokine-mediated lymphocyte trafficking in the infected tissue or lymphocytes exhaustion in the peripheral blood and sequestration in the lung induced by cytokine storm35. There may also be immune-mediated lymphocyte destruction, bone marrow or thymus suppression, or apoptosis38, as is reported in other virus infection, which requires further study. In addition, high-throughput TCR sequencing identified expanded T cell clones in ERS patients. In LRS patients, the immunophenotype was different. In particular, LRS patients would have an increase in T and NK cells, with a lower expression of inflammatory genes. We also performed a detailed analysis of B cells in patients and identified a higher population of plasma cells than that in the HCs. We found that BCR contained highly expanded clones, indicating their SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Importantly, we found several loci unique to COVID-19 infection. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity, which has not been reported yet. Notably, numerous studies have reported biased usage of VDJ genes related to virus-specific antibodies. For example, IGHV3-30 and IGKV3-11 have been involved in encoding primary antibodies to neutralize human cytomegalovirus39,40. In addition, IGHV3-30 and IGHV3-21 have been utilized to isolate influenza virus antibodies and used for the production of virus vaccines41,42. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that antibodies combining the IGHV3-15/IGLV1-40 segments had superior neutralizing activities against the Zaire Ebola virus43. In addition, we observed lower expression of inflammatory genes in ERS patients than in the HCs. We envision that our results will provide direction for the development of vaccines and antibodies for COVID-19 patients.",

Our cell-to-cell prediction analysis utilizing scRNA-seq data indicated that, in ERS patients, B cell-derived IL-6, T cell-derived CSF1 (M-CSF), and CSF2 (GM-CSF) may promote monocyte proliferation and activation. As a result, monocytes may produce a larger number of inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, contributing to inflammatory storm. In LRS patients, both DCs-derived TNFSF13 and IL-18 and T cell-derived IL-2, IL-4 may promote B cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Consequently, B cells produce numerous SARS-COV-2-specific antibodies to clear viruses, which is in agreement with the research of Zhou Y, et al.44 who reported CD4+ T cells are activated into T-helper (Th) 1 cells and generate GM-CSF etc. to induced inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes with high expression of IL-6 and accelerates the inflammation after 2019-nCoV infection.",

Immune cells can be classified into distinct types based on specific surface markers with the aid of flow cytometry and microscopy. However, not all immune cell types can be completely addressed by a separate analysis of phenotypic markers, as many markers are expressed by multiple cell lineages or are regulated differently during inflammation. In recent years, sequencing technology has been widely used in biological research. On this base, scRNA-seq is used in immunological research to seek to address previously unrecognized cellular heterogeneity, and to reveal key pathways in gene regulatory networks that predict immune function45. In the present study, we applied single-cell technology to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the recovery stage of COVID-19. scRNA-seq is a powerful tool to identify novel cell subsets during disease progression. In our study, CD14+IL1\u03b2 subpopulation was mapped using this method, which uncovered the originator cells in ERS patients. In conclusion, our study provided the first immune atlas of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and identified adaptive immune dysregulation after discharge. The clonal expansion of both T and B cells indicated that the immune system has gradually recovered; however, the sustained hyper-inflammatory response for more than 7 days after discharge suggested the need for medical observation after patients are discharged from hospital. Longitudinal studies of recovered patients in a larger cohort might help to understand the consequences of the disease. The novel BCRs identified in our study may advance our understanding of B cell mechanisms and have potential clinical utility in COVID-19 immunotherapies.",
