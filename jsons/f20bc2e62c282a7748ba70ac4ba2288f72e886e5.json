Seeking a path J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f forward, public health agencies and governments are balancing considerations for the health of their populations, the freedom of their citizens, and the ongoing impact of economic constraints. In Europe this has resulted in different timelines and strategies; France has decided that its lockdown will remain in place until 11 May, while Austria opened small shops on 14 April, and Germany has planned for slowly reopening schools, starting with the youngest children first. 4 In sports, most of the major professional leagues were halted early during the pandemic. For instance, the Italian Serie A football league was paused March 9, but may recommence play again in late May or early June. 5 Before the league is resumes, all players have to be tested for the SARS-CoV-2. In Germany, the Bundesliga is planning to resume in May, but the games will be played in front of empty stands, as no major public spectator events will be held until at least September. 6 In the English Premier League, players have had their April wages cut by up to 25 percent, and the clubs have reached an agreement with the players' union to cut some levels of future salaries. 7 In women's football, the situation is even more serious.",

Many governments have understood the dire situation for these sports communities during the lockdown and developed comprehensive support plans. For instance, in Sweden (pop. 10 million), the government has assigned half a billion SEK (USD 50M) to the sports movement. 13 The criteria used to distribute the funds are solidarity with the sports that suffer the most, continued existence of community sports clubs, and support of child and youth sports. Also nongovernment organisations have volunteered to help sports manage the consequences of the lockdown. In Sweden, Svenska Spel, a sports gambling company, distributes every year about SEK 50 million (USD 5M) to sports clubs. In normal years, the money is paid out in November, but this year half the funds have been distributed already to about 3,600 sports clubs. 14 Having endured the lockdown, reopening societies is likely to be a long-term process around which little scientific consensus yet exists. To choose lockdown exit pathways is challenging, because the present knowledge about the effectiveness of the different social distancing measures is mainly limited to that of influenza. 15 The lockdown exit strategies will in consequence differ between nations and be marked by trial and error. In many countries, a suppression and lift scenario can be expected to occur, i.e. easing social distancing measures when it is possible, then clamping down again when case rates climb back up. In a recent simulation analysis, where it must be noted that many parameters were assigned assumed values, the COVID-19 incidence over the next five years was found to depend upon whether or not the SARS-Cov-2 enters into regular circulation. 16 The probability of regular circulation of the virus was suggested to be associated with the duration of immunity that the SARS-CoV-2 infection induces, but also on the time of year when the virus is reintroduced and, to some extent, the level of cross-immunity that exists between coronaviruses. The researchers conclude that it is reasonable to except SARS-Cov-2 circulation in parallel to existing infectious diseases, such as influenza. This implies that there is a need for consideration of During a prolonged lockdown exiting process, such behaviour is highly problematic and must be restrained, taking into regard the consequences for high-risk groups and other athletes as well.",

It may be argued that if sports people know they are taking risks but accept them as the price of pursuing goals to which they assign higher priority, then it is not motivated for sports governing bodies to insist that health matters be valued above anything else. 18 However, non-compliance with lockdown exit policies, which might be founded upon misperception of risks or other personal priorities, creates the free rider problem. 19 This problem has been analysed at length in the vaccination context, and can be avoided during a prolonged lockdown exit by strongly pointing out the negative effects of deliberately neglecting precautions and protective behaviour. 20 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f that require attention, among sportspeople and in the general population alike. 21 The most affected groups are often those who are already the most vulnerable.

Social distancing and case isolation have been the foundation of most national strategies, while border restrictions have been used to decrease international travel.

During this intermittent period, it is imperative that sports authorities plead for individual responsibility in avoiding unnecessary risks for spread of SARS-CoV-2. During this, potentially extended, period of time, positioning with regard to personal freedom and social responsibility will be put to the test. As the risk of becoming infected with SARS-Cov-2 is dependent on other people's compliance with the social distancing regulations, unwillingness to contribute to the joint effort is unfair on other members of society and other sportspersons. 17 During periods of extended social distancing, most sports people can be expected to act in a socially responsible way and in solidarity with the greater community, thus contributing to a decreased infection risk. However, some sportspersons, by ignoring pleas for protective and preventive behaviour, may choose to take advantage of the benefits of the majority complying with health recommendations.",
