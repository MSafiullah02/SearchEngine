These ncRNAs mainly include: (1) Viral ncRNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase (Pol) III. For example, two virus-associated (VA) RNAs encoded by Human adenovirus (Reich et al., 1966, Steitz et al., 2010), EBER1 and EBER2 encoded by Epstein\u2013Barr virus (Skalsky and Cullen, 2015), miRNA precursors encoded by murine \u03b3-herpesviral tRNA-pre-miRNA chimeras (Bogerd et al., 2010, Bowden et al., 1997, Diebel et al., 2010) and retrovirus (Kincaid et al., 2012), and intragenic viral small ncRNA encoded by Human bocavirus 1 (Wang et al., 2017); (2) Viral ncRNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II. For example, polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) RNA encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (Sun et al., 1996, Zhong and Ganem, 1997), the ~2-kb latency-associated transcript (LAT) expressed by Herpes simplex virus (Bloom, 2004), a conserved ~5-kb intron expressed by Human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) (Kulesza and Shenk, 2004), and a 7.2-kb RNA expressed by mouse CMV (Kulesza and Shenk, 2006), U-rich RNAs (HSURs) produced by Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), (Albrecht and Fleckenstein, 1992, Ensser and Fleckenstein, 2005); (3) Subgenomic ncRNAs from single-stranded RNA viruses by incomplete degradation of genomic RNA by the cellular 5\u20133\u2032 exonuclease XRN1. For example, subgenomic RNA (sfRNA) produced by Flaviviruses, such as Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus [reviewed in (Bidet and Garcia-Blanco, 2014; Roby et al., 2014; Pijlman et al., 2008; Akiyama et al., 2016), and subgenomic ncRNA generated by some plant viruses such as Barley yellow dwarf virus and Red clover necrotic mosaic virus using similar mechanism (Miller et al., 2016a).",

            "text": "Viral ncRNAs play important roles in viral life cycle. Adenovirus VA RNAs are characterized for their role in counteracting the host antiviral defense through inhibition of protein kinase R (PKR) (Mathews and Shenk, 1991, Wilson et al., 2014). EBER2 regulates the expression of a subset of EBV latent genes throung the interaction of EBER2 and a cellular transcription factor paired box protein 5 (PAX5) (Arvey et al., 2012, Lee et al., 2015). Degradation of miR-27 by mediated HSUR 1 promotes activation and presumably proliferation of HVS-infected host T cells (Cazalla et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2014). KSHV PAN RNA is essential for virion production (Borah et al., 2011).\u03b2-herpesvirus HCMV-encoded \u03b22.7 prevents mitochondria-induced apoptosis, enabling steady ATP production for viral processes and persistent infection (Campbell et al., 2008, Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012). SfRNA produced by Flaviviruses is required for cytopathicity and pathogenicity (Pijlman et al., 2008). It has been demonstrated to 1) interfere with cellular RNA decay pathways by inhibiting XRN1 (Moon et al., 2012), 2) dampen the antiviral activity of type I interferon (Schuessler et al., 2012) and 3) inhibit the RNAi pathway in both the vertebrate and arthropod hosts, most likely by serving as a decoy substrate for Dicer (Schnettler et al., 2012). Inhibition of the host interferon response appears to be, at least in some Flaviviruses, achieved by binding and inactivating cellular regulators of translation of interferon-upregulated mRNAs (Bidet et al., 2014). NcRNAs encoded by some plant RNA viruses can inhibit host translation and overwhelm host's RNA interference system to favor virus infection (Miller et al., 2016b).",

IBV is an enveloped positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus causing the acute highly contagious poultry disease infectious bronchitis (Cavanagh, 2005). Like other coronaviruses, IBV can produce sgRNAs via a discontinuous transcription mechanism to encode its structural proteins and specific accessory proteins (Masters, 2006, Sawicki et al., 2007). Briefly, IBV produces six mRNA species in the infected cells, including its genomic mRNA1, sgRNA2 encoding spike (S) protein, sgRNA3 encoding 3a, 3b and envelope (E) protein, sgRNA4 encoding membrane (M) protein, sgRNA5 encoding 5a and 5b, and sgRNA6 encoding nucleocapsid (N) protein. Recently, a low-abundance sgRNA located between the sgRNA4 and 5 has been identified (Bentley et al., 2013).",

Sequence analysis indicated that it consists of 563 nucleotides excluding a poly(A) tail, is mainly derived from the 3\u2032-UTR (from nucleotides 27104\u201327608) of IBV genome, and contains a 63-nt-long of terminal leader sequence derived from the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome (\nFig. 2). The results showed the generation of a novel sgRNA in the IBV-infected cells. This sgRNA may be overlooked in previous studies because of its smaller size and lower level of transcription. Due to lack of start codon AUG, this sgRNA is designated as a noncoding RNA (ncRNA). Insertion of an ORF encoding EGFP (carrying its own start codon) between 27149 and 27150 nt of IBV 3\u2032-UTR allowed the recovery of recombinant virus. RT-PCR analysis showed the presence of the EGFP-containing sgRNA and fluorescence confirmed EGFP expression in virus-infected cells (\nFig. 3), implying that the ncRNA is an mRNA. However, this virus was unstable and a deletion of 377 nucleotide acids (from 81 to 457 nt) of EGEP sequences was detected in passage 3 in Vero cells (data not shown).",

These results prompt us to speculate that this ncRNA, like the other viral sgRNA, may be generated by a discontinuous transcription mechanism via template switch mediated by a noncanonical core sequence (UAACA). To confirm this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of several mutations on ncRNA generation by mutagenesis and reverse genetics. As shown in\nFig. 4, compared to wild-type rIBV, single mutation U27104A and A27108U had no or minor effect on ncRNA synthesis; A27105U resulted in a significant reduction in the ncRNA generation, while mutation C27107G, A27106U and deletion of five nucleotides (\u039427104-08) completely abolished the synthesis of both positive-stranded and negative-stranded ncRNA (Fig. 4), suggesting that at least three nucleotides (A27105/A27106/C27107) are involved in the effective ncRNA generation. The results confirmed previous report that IBV can synthesize sgRNA via template switch mediated by a noncanonical core sequence (Bentley et al., 2013) Notably, the mutant virus carrying four mutations (A27100U/A27111U/G27113C/G27114C) was also unable to produce ncRNA (Fig. 4), suggesting these nucleotides are required for ncRNA production. Because the sequence motif (A27100/A27111/G27113/G27114) located downstream of the truncated CS (UAACA) also exists downstream of the CS (CUUAACAA) in the leader TRS (\nTable 1, marked in bold), our result prove that the sequences downstream of the CS exert a stronger influence on coronavirus sgRNA synthesis (Sola et al., 2005). Taken together, the results confirm that the ncRNA generation involves a discontinuous transcription process in which the 5\u2032 leader sequence and 3\u2032-UTR are fused through the transcription-regulating sequences in the 3\u2032 end of the leader and in the 5\u2032 end of the 3\u2032-UTR.",

The five sgRNAs (mRNAs 2\u20136) of IBV, which are readily detected by Northern blotting, possess the canonical core sequence (5\u2032- CU(U/G)AACAA-3\u2032) (Table 1). It has been reported that coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus and IBV, can use noncanonical CS to synthesize sgRNA via discontinuous transcription mechanism (Zhang and Liu, 2000, Hussain et al., 2005, Bentley et al., 2013). In this report, we have identified the existence of a novel sgRNA derived mainly from the 3\u2032 UTR of IBV in the IBV-infected cells (Fig. 1). The synthesis of this sgRNA is mediated by a truncated CS (27104UAACA27108) identical to nucleotides of 3\u20137 of IBV CS. Among which at least three nucleotides (A27105/A27106/C27107) are involved in the effective sgRNA generation (Fig. 2, Fig. 4), providing more evidence for the use of noncanonical transcriptional signals in synthesis of coronavirus sgRNAs. In addition, we verified that the sequence motif (A27100/A27111/G27113/G27114) located downstream of the truncated CS (UAACA) is necessary for ncRNA generation (Fig. 4), reinforcing the importance of nucleotides immediately flanking CS in coronavirus sgRNA synthesis (Sola et al., 2005).",
