The PHQ-2 asks about frequencies of two depressive symptoms, depressed mood and anhedonia, and has been validated as a brief screening tool for detecting major depression in older adults using a nationally representative sample (Li, Friedman, Conwell, & Fiscella, 2007). In the NHATS surveys, the respondents were asked to evaluate how often, in the past month, (1) they had little interest or pleasure in doing things; and (2) they felt down, depressed, or hopeless. Both questions were measured on a four-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), and these questions were to summed for a total score ranging from 0 to 6. Kroenke et al. (2003) used a PHQ-2 total score of 3 to determine a positive screen for major depressive symptoms. We adopted this cut point to categorize the older adult respondents into three depressive symptom groups: no depressive symptoms (0), mild depressive symptoms (1 or 2), and major depressive symptoms (3 to 6). The no depressive symptoms group was used as a base outcome in the multinomial logistic regression model.",

Number of chronic diseases was measured by summing nine possible chronic health conditions for which each individual had ever been diagnosed by a doctor (range = 0 to 5, where 5 equals five to nine chronic conditions). Physical capacity was measured at the lower and higher level of functional capacities. The respondents were asked in the past month, (1) whether they had difficulty with physical movements and (2) if they responded affirmatively, whether it was without help from another person or without any assistive devices (e.g., cane, walker). Physical movements included six pairs of less challenging and more challenging tasks (e.g., walking three and six blocks, going up 10 and 20 stairs). We used the two-dimensional physical capacity measures developed and validated by Freedman and colleagues (2011): (1) inability to do any less challenging task and (2) ability to do all more challenging tasks (1 = yes for each).",

Similarly, Choi and Dinitto (2013a) reported a 17% ICT use rate in a sample of low-income older adults in which 57.7% identified as non-white, racial and ethnic minorities.

However, married or partnered older adults appear to be taking advantage of ICT at higher rates. There are two possible explanations for this outcome: (1) married or partnered older adults may help each other learn how to use ICT and subsequently increase their motivation to use this technology; and (2) it is also possible that older married or partnered couples may have a higher level of income or access to ample resources so that they can afford an Internet service and digital devices (e.g., computer, tablet, or smartphone).",

Perrin and Duggan (2015) reported little difference by gender for Internet use across all age groups. For older adults, Gell et al. (2015) found that men were more likely to use ICT, yet other studies found no significant association between gender and ICT use (Choi & Dinitto, 2013a, 2013b). A nuanced understanding of gender differences in ICT use can be achieved by investigating the older adult's purpose for ICT use. For example, our findings revealed that women were more likely to use only CT, whereas men were more likely to use only IT. These findings lend support for older women's ICT use more so for social rather than instrumental purposes (Ihm & Hsieh, 2015). Moreover, older ICT users utilized technology for various purposes while IT users were limited to certain activities such as banking (44.2%), shopping (32%), and health condition-information search (36.2%). To increase older adult IT user's motives for utilizing technology that go beyond a single application for activities such as banking, a health-related mobile application (app) can be introduced so they can easily access health information without needing to execute complicated and multistep web searches. Additionally, to accommodate a CT user's context in which more than half (53.5%) texted or emailed on \u201cmost\u201d days and 29.1% on \u201csome\u201d days in the past month, health care providers could send daily or weekly health-related information via text, email, or the institution's official mobile application. An easy-to-use app is feasible for both patients and institution because it can protect patients\u2019 personal information while tailoring to each patient's health-related issue and delivery preference. Efforts to increase ICT use among older adults may initially need to be adjusted to the current and potential users\u2019 main motivations for technology use before moving to a more integrated use of CT and IT.",

They posited that the relationship between the digital divide (Internet users vs. non-users) and health status would reflect socioeconomic inequalities in health among older adults. On the contrary, the current study found a positive association between ICT use and self-reported health status after controlling socioeconomic status variables (i.e., annual income, education level, employment for payment). Unlike Gracia and Herrero's (2009) focus on the digital divide, the present study attempted to unveil digital inequalities in ICT use and explored how they were reflected in a relationship with self-reported health status among older adults who were able to access to the Internet and knew how to use computer. Because the study sample is comprised of Medicare beneficiaries residing in the community, it is also possible that their overall health status would be better than that of older adults living in nursing homes or other care facilities. More research is needed to explore the relationship between digital inequalities and health status with diverse samples of older adults who might have less access to resources based on educational level, racial and ethnic minority status, and care needs.",

The present study revealed that ICT use was negatively associated with experiencing major depressive symptoms after controlling other covariates; however, it was not associated with experiencing mild depressive symptoms. Our finding regarding major depressive symptoms is in contrast to those of other studies that analyzed NHATS data and did not find a link between ICT use and depression (Choi & Dinitto, 2013b; Elliot et al., 2014). Choi and Dinitto (2013a) found that low-income homebound older adults who reported a diagnosis of depression used the Internet more than older adults who were not depressed. The discrepancies between these findings may be attributed to differences in samples (e.g., community-based sample vs. low-income homebound older adults), respondent eligibility criteria, or analytic strategies. However, they highlight a need for further research regarding the relationship between ICT use and depressive symptoms in older adults. A more thorough understanding of the diversity in ICT use among older adults and its association with different levels of depressive symptoms may be used to support better access to mental health care services in this population by utilizing digital technology in the current health care system.",

The combination of access to information and use of the Internet to build social support might strengthen health status, as Elliot et al. (2014) speculated. Alternately, as evidenced by Choi and Dinitto (2013a), older adults with depression were more likely to use the Internet than those without depression, and older adults who experience poor health but are able to access and use technology may be motived to use technology for health-related purposes (e.g., searching for health information or communicating with healthcare providers). More research needs to test potential moderating factors that may affect the relationships between technology use and physical and mental health status. Also, the ability of older adults to use ICT in this study may be due, in part, to their higher cognitive functioning based on their self-reported health status. As noted previously, the community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries in the current study are likely to have better health status than persons with more health care needs (e.g., homebound older adults, nursing home residents), or racial and ethnic minority older adults. Future research needs to replicate our study to elucidate how specific types of technology use (i.e., ICT, IT, and CT) are associated with health status using diverse samples of older adults and detailed measures of digital technology use.",

These interventions can consist of didactic and experiential learning exercises that will serve to enhance their self-efficacy (Davis, 1989; Kim et al., 2016), reduce distrust in technology (Knowles & Hanson, 2018), and leverage peer support to improve uptake (Kim et al., 2016). These interventions will also focus on teaching older adults various ways that they can obtain health-related information, communicate with their health care provider, and become active participants in their care (self-management). To make the learning exercises as successful and useful as possible, it is also recommended that older adults play a role in their design and implementation (Knowles & Hanson, 2018). It is noteworthy that some older adults are limited to using technologies for only IT or CT purposes. Therefore, health care providers should consider the sociodemographic and health characteristics of their patients as they begin to integrate specific technologies into the health treatment plan. Then, based on the outcome of this simple technology use, they can eventually integrate ICT in the health management and treatment of older adult patients. Ultimately, the long-term goal is for health care programs to reduce the gaps between different levels of technology use as well as disparities between non-users and users in the older population through the gradual integration of technology into the overall treatment approach.",

Nursing professionals can play a pivotal role in facilitating epidemiological screening for older adults, those who would fall in a high-risk group for infection and mortality, using digital technology. ICT-based screening and consultation with nursing professionals can help older adults access adequate health-related information, engage in social/physical distancing while seeking proper medical behaviors, and reduce the likelihood of being potentially infected by avoiding interactions with multiple individuals. Also, ICT in this context would provide a lifeline to older adults who wish to communicate with their providers, help reduce social isolation, offer information and resources in addition to what is shared in the media, and promote a sense of agency by giving older adults resources to help them manage during a public health crisis.",

Therefore, these selection criteria may have excluded the most vulnerable older adults who have limited resources, complex health conditions, or language challenges. Second, the measures of CT use in the NHATS survey did not discriminate between emailing and texting. Third, other types of technology use, such as ebooks, Twitter, and other social networking sites, were not captured because the 2011 NHATS survey did not collect this information. Also, it did not factor in the level of accessibility (e.g., Wi-Fi speed) and mode of technology (i.e., smart phones, basic phones, computers, or tablets). Unlike the CT measure, the IT use variables (e.g., grocery shopping or contacting health care providers) measured only the respondents\u2019 purposes of Internet usage, not the frequency of such activities.

Nurses, who constitute the largest group of health care professionals in the U.S. (American Associaton of Colleges of Nursing, 2011), can incorporate ICT into their practice as a means to engage in better health promotion efforts and provide nursing care access to the greatest number of community members and patients. Studies have shown the benefit of nurse-led technology-based interventions among older adults in terms of reported user satisfaction, better quality of life and health status, and reduced nursing home admission and mortality (Chau et al., 2012; Rabins et al., 2000; Tappenden, Campbell, Rawdin, Wong, & Kalita, 2012). Limited health care resources coupled with increased demand for health care services support the use of technology as an important supplement to traditional in-person interactions. By incorporating ICT into nursing practice, patients can benefit from access to high quality health information, prevention strategies, and frequent communication with their nurse. Timely assessments and interventions, and enhanced service coordination can be of consequences (While & Dewsbury, 2011). Further, strengthening the patient-nurse relationship through ICT use has the potential to improve the health outcomes of a population that is disproportionately affected by multiple chronic conditions, and provide vital access to health care services for older adults residing in rural settings.",
