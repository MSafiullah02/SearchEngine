However, in general, agents do not connect randomly to their peers [14\u201316]. During their activity, individuals remember their friends and their social circles and they are more inclined to interact with already known pals, establishing strong and weak ties with their peers [17,18]. Recent works have tackled this problem by applying a data-driven approach. A tie allocation mechanism in real systems has been measured, introducing a memory process on top of activity-driven models [19,20]. As reasonably expected, social interactions are not randomly established but they are rather concentrated towards already contacted nodes, with a reinforcement process encoded in a single measurable memory parameter. The memory process tunes the network evolution, which can be predicted at large times [21\u201323], and it is also expected to influence dynamical processes. Non-Markovian dynamics can indeed change the spreading rate in a diffusion process, slowing it down in some cases and speeding it up in others [24\u201330]. Disparate effects have been shown to occur also in epidemic spreading on activity-driven networks, where memory can lower or increase the epidemic threshold in the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) or susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, respectively [31]. This happens when the epidemic process and the network evolution start at the same time. However, the network evolution in the presence of non-Markovian effects could introduce aging in the process [32], as usually observed in processes with memory also in other fields [33], and this could further influence the spreading dynamics.",

Introducing an activity-based mean-field (ABMF) approximation, we derive analytically, as a function of the activity distribution and of the parameter tuning the memory, a prediction for the threshold, holding for both the SIS and the SIR models. The result shows that memory overall reinforces the effects of activity fluctuations, leading to a lower value for the epidemic threshold. We prove that the ABMF approximation is equivalent to an epidemic model defined on an effective static network, which we also investigate. Numerical simulations evidence that the ABMF approach provides exact results when the epidemics start after the network has evolved for a long time. In this regime indeed the mean field holds since agents have been connected to a large number of pairs, while the creation of new links becomes negligible.",

In particular, at weak memory the creation of new links cannot be discarded and this increases the epidemic threshold according to the memoryless predictions. On the other hand, for strong memory, at short times the dynamics displays correlations among infection probabilities of nodes which have already been in contact. The correlations give rise to backtracking effects that cannot be ignored. In this case, typically the threshold of the SIS and SIR models are respectively smaller and larger with respect to the mean-field prediction. We explain in detail the origin of such deviations, opening new perspectives for epidemic control of disease and information spreading on temporal networks with high correlations.",

Connections last for a temporal interval \u0394t. At the next time step t+\u0394t all existing edges are deleted and the procedure is iterated.

Real data observations indicate that human interactions are very often characterized by skewed and long-tailed activity distributions [10], so F(a) is typically assumed to be a power law F(a)=Ba\u2212(\u03bd+1) with \u025b\u2264ai\u2264A.

            "text": "In order to take into account the tendency of individuals to persist in their social connections, a reinforcement mechanism was recently introduced in activity-driven models [19,21]. The nodes are endowed with a memory of their previous contacts and they have a propensity to establish contacts preferably with individuals belonging to their social circle. For an active node vi, which has already contacted ki(t) different nodes at time t, this process is described by assuming that the node connects with a new node with probability\n(1)p[ki(t)]=[1+ki(t)/ci]\u2212\u03b2i,while it establishes a connection with a previously contacted node with complementary probability 1\u2212p[ki(t)]. The probability depends on the degree of the integrated network at time t, ki(t), i.e., the number of nodes that vi has contacted up to time t. We will call Aij(t) the adjacency matrix of this integrated network. The parameter \u03b2i>0 tunes the memory process. For \u03b2i\u22480 the probability p[ki(t)]\u22481 weakly depends on the growing degree ki(t), while at large \u03b2i, p[ki(t)] rapidly decays with ki(t). The constant ci sets an intrinsic value for the number of connections that node vi is able to engage in before memory effects become relevant. Empirical measures on several data sets [21] are compatible with constant values of \u03b2i=\u03b2 and ci=c, so the function p(\u00b7) turns out to be independent of i. In particular, the exponent \u03b2 ranges from \u03b2\u22480.15 in the citation networks to \u03b2\u22480.5 in Twitter mentions and to \u03b2\u22481.2 in the mobile phone calls. In this paper we study the dependence of the epidemic threshold on the value of the exponent \u03b2, while we set c=1 and m=1, with no loss of generality.",

This lower value is a consequence of the fact that memory reinforces the activity fluctuations, and in these models fluctuations clearly reduce the epidemic threshold, as shown by Eq. (7). The effect can be simply understood since nodes with large activity have also a large degree, therefore they are easily involved in epidemic contacts not only because they are frequently activated but also because they are frequently contacted by other nodes. In this way memory reinforces the effect of activity fluctuations. In this framework, Fig. 1 also shows that at large \u03bd, i.e., for increasingly smaller fluctuations, the difference with the memoryless model vanishes. In particular, for F(a)=\u03b4(a\u2212a0), i.e., when the activity does not fluctuate, one obtains from Eq. (15)\n\u2202t\u03c1(t)=\u2212\u03bc\u03c1(t)+2a0\u03bb[1\u2212\u03c1(t)], which is the same equation as in the memoryless case. This also explains the quite surprising observation that the threshold is a growing function of \u03b2, converging to the memoryless case as \u03b2\u2192\u221e. Indeed, the tail of the degree distribution decays at large k as k\u2212[(1+\u03b2)\u03bd+1]\n[21], therefore at large \u03b2 we get a faster decay and smaller degree fluctuations. For the same reason, in the limit \u03b2\u21920 the difference with the memoryless case is maximal, since degree inhomogeneities are stronger in this case.\n",

The memory process leads to the formation of small clusters of mutually connected high activity vertices, which become reservoirs of the disease in the SIS model. The high frequency of mutual contacts allows for reinfection, favoring the overall survival of the epidemic spreading in the system. In this way, social circles with high activity play a role analogous to that played by the maximum K-core or the hub and its immediate neighbors for SIS epidemics in static networks [38,39]. To clarify the effect of dynamical correlations at finite time, in the next section we compare the analytical predictions with the results of numerical simulations. As a final remark, we note that, in the asymptotic ABMF approach, the linear stability analysis also holds for the SIR model, implying that the epidemic threshold is the same of the SIS model. However, in the SIR model reinfection is not allowed, so the initial presence of small clusters of mutually connected high activity vertices effectively inhibits the spread of the disease.

We remark that \u2329k\u232a\u2248100 is large enough for observing mean-field behavior but also it is much smaller than the total number of sites N=5\u00d7104, so the system is not fully connected and degree fluctuations are important.

This leads to positive or negative corrections to the asymptotic value of the threshold, depending on the initial conditions and on the reinforcement parameter \u03b2. In the SIR case instead, since reinfection is not possible, the interaction within social circles is strongly detrimental for the epidemic propagation, so the asymptotic value of the threshold is always reached from above.
