The filoviruses are known to be the major causes of hemorrhagic fever in humans and non\u2010human primates 25. The filamentous morphology of the viruses led to the name Filoviridae, which is derived from the Latin word \u201cfilum,\u201d which means filament 1. The genus Ebolavirus includes five species: Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus (TAFV; previously known as Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus), Reston virus (RESTV) and EBOV (formerly known as the Zaire ebolavirus; Figure 1) 2. The SUDV and EBOV appear to be more involved with the known outbreaks and are more pathogenic than the RESTV and the TAFV 26. Of the known EVD\u2010causing viruses, EBOV is considered to be the most dangerous and was involved in the largest number of outbreaks including the 2013\u20132015 outbreak 2, 7. The RESTV was a cause of fatal hemorrhagic disease in non\u2010human primates with no reported involvement in human disease so far 27. Based on genetic similarities, the Ebolaviruses are closely related to Marburgviruses 2.",

A difference in the GP gene organization has been reported between EBOV and MARV 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. Between the five known species of the genus Ebolavirus, there is a difference of 37\u201340% and 34\u201343% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively 28, 32. This indicates that BDBV, REBOV, SUDV, TAFV, and EBOV are distinct and represent different species. Despite the difference in the Ebolavirus species, they show some degree of genetic stability 28, 32, 34. The genetic stasis suggests that there is an association with a particular host, and genetic variations are just ways of evolution and adaptation to the natural host. Within the order Mononegavirales, based on the extent of sequence homologies in the N\u2010terminus of the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase, the filoviruses are considered more similar to paramyxoviruses than to rhabdoviruses 35.",

It is important to note that transcriptional initiation and termination are also controlled by highly conserved motifs flanking the genes of the filovirus 42, 43. The individual gene transcriptional signals begin at the 3\u2032 end and terminate with a transcriptional termination (polyadenylation) site 36, 37, 38. Transcription is terminated when the polymerase encounters a series of five to six uridines where the polymerase stops and adds a long poly\u2010A tail to the transcripts 36, 37, 38.

VP35 interaction with the Small Ubiquitin\u2010like Modifier (SUMO) E2 enzyme Ubc9 and the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 of the SUMOylation machinery facilitated the selective SUMOylation of IRF\u20107 and the blocking of the IFN transcription 60, 61.

In humans, EBOV infections have typically occurred in rural settings, possibly through contact with infected non\u2010human primates' body fluids 67. Evidence strongly suggests fruit bats as the natural reservoirs for EBOV 69. In Africa, fruit bats such as Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franqueti, and Myonycteris torquata were found as the natural hosts of the EBOV 4. In addition, non\u2010human primates, such as apes or monkeys, can be infected 70. Bats dropping partially eaten fruits represent the likely means by which the virus transmission to humans starts. Mammals like gorillas, apes, monkeys, or duikers feeding on the partially eaten fruits can acquire the infection, which can be then be transmitted to humans 67. In Guinea, it is believed that the current outbreak started when a child played with insectivorous bats from a colony of Angolan free\u2010tailed bats near his or her village 71. Early outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo have usually involved bat reservoirs in or around a subterranean gold mine 71. People who are in healthcare settings, in close contact with secretions of an infected patient, or involved in the burial of infected dead bodies are at a higher risk for EBOV infection 72. Transmission of EBOV occurs through close contact with skin and secretions of an individual suffering from active infection. Urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomitus, breast milk, and semen, and virus\u2010contaminated objects can transmit the infection as well 73. The infection with EBOV needs a relatively high viral dose of 107\u2013108 pfu/g 4. Transmission is not likely to occur before the onset of symptoms. The incubation period of EBOV before the onset of symptoms ranges from 2 to 21 days 4. The EBOV enters the body through small skin lesions and mucous membranes, after which it reaches the blood stream 73, 74.

The GP1 subunit contains the receptor\u2010binding domain and mediates interaction with the cognate receptor on the host cell, interacts with, and preserves the conformation of the GP2 transmembrane subunit 87. The GP2 subunit contains the machinery required for the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane 85, 86. The GP1 subunit consists of three domains: (i) the N\u2010terminus half is highly conserved and forms the base that interacts extensively with GP2 maintaining it in its prefusion state; (ii) the head that contains the receptor\u2010binding sequences; and (iii) the C\u2010terminus domain, which comprises highly glycosylated regions named the glycan cap and the mucin domain 88 (Figure 2).

The mucin domain may not be required for the EBOV\u2010GP dependent pseudovirus entry in vitro but is proposed to mediate viral adhesion to specific cell types and play a role in evasion of immune responses, by masking key neutralization epitopes 89, 90.

Evidence through several studies supports the latter scenario.

The cleavage of GP into GP1 and GP2 by furin is dispensable both in vitro and in vivo and if blocked does not affect the infectivity of the virus.

However, the protection reported in both studies was inconsistent, and the elicited immune response was insufficient to protect baboons against lethal doses of EBOV. Several studies have shown tremendous efforts to develop subunit vaccines against EBOV since 1990. Earlier studies led to the conclusion that mice and guinea pigs are the most protected species, while non\u2010human primates need to mount a more robust immune response to achieve protection 118, 119, 120, 121. However, a study published in Nature showed that DNA\u2010based immunization and boosting with adenoviral vectors, which encode viral proteins, generated cellular and humoral immunity in cynomolgus macaques that remained asymptomatic for more than 6 months, with no detectable virus after the initial challenge, while the unvaccinated animals died in less than a week 122. The controversy in the results obtained from vaccine studies on non\u2010human primates indicates that more extensive research is required to develop vaccines that provide complete protection against EBOV.",

The cAd3\u2010EBOV is derived from chimpanzee adenovirus type 3 and engineered to express the EBOV\u2010GP and SUDV\u2010GP. The second vaccine candidate, the rVSV\u2010EBOV, was at first developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and then by Merck Inc. 123, 124. The rVSV\u2010EBOV was effective against EBOV in non\u2010human primates 123, 124. Other vaccine candidates were developed by Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals and by the Chinese government, and they have been approved for clinical trials. Being an acute infection, instantaneous protective measures including antiviral small molecules and passive antibody therapy may be promising in combating EBOV HF.",

One of the considered treatments is the transfusion of whole blood or purified serum from EBOV survivors that was identified as a possible treatment in early 1970s 125, 126. In December 2014, the first clinical trial of this therapy, including 70 patients, started at the Eternal Love Winning Africa 2 treatment center in Liberia and is sponsored by the Gates Foundation in collaboration with national health authorities and WHO. Further clinical trials will soon start in Guinea and Sierra Leone 123. ZMapp, is a combination of three humanized murine monoclonal antibodies developed by Mapp Biopharmaceuticals Inc. and produced in tobacco plants. In mice, 43% of ZMapp\u2010treated animals survived, and it proved to be highly effective in a trial involving rhesus macaque monkeys 127, 128.

The drug was formulated using lipid nanoparticle technology by Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp and now named as TKM\u2010Ebola. A phase I clinical trial involving healthy volunteers was initiated in 2013\u20132014 but was quickly suspended due to adverse side effects 129. However, later the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of TKM\u2010Ebola in emergency situations. Several small molecule inhibitors of viral replication or entry were developed by different groups. Of the EBOV antivirals, favipiravir, also known as T\u2010705 or Avigan, chemically defined as a pyrazinecarboxamide derivative and initially developed in Japan to treat influenza infection, is effective against a mouse model of EBOV infection 130. Favipiravir showed inhibitory activity against influenza virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and foot and mouth disease virus in addition to flaviviruses, arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, and alphaviruses 131. Activity against enteroviruses and Rift Valley virus has also been documented 131, 132. Favipiravir inhibits viral RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase 133. The adenosine nucleoside analog, BCX4430, is a broad\u2010spectrum antiviral drug initially developed by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals against hepatitis C and is currently tested against EBOV by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases 134, 135, 136. BCX4430 shows efficacy against a wide range of other viruses, including bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, and flaviviruses 134, 135, 136. BCX4430 protects against EBOV and MARV in both rodents and monkeys, even when administered up to 48 h post\u2010infection 134, 135, 136.

Drugs currently approved for other diseases inhibited EBOV in vitro and in animal models, for example, cationic amphiphiles (amiodarone, dronedarone, verapamil, clomiphene, and toremifene), Na+ channel and Na+/K+ exchange blockers (amiloride), Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitors (digoxin, digitoxin, and ouabain) 21, 22, 142.

Other interventions include (i) recombinant human activated protein C (RhAPC) for the post\u2010exposure treatment of EBOV infection in rhesus macaques and (ii) recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2), a potent inhibitor of tissue factor initiated blood coagulation, which prolonged survival time in rhesus macaques challenged with EBOV lethal dose 145, 146. Previously described efforts demonstrate that an anti\u2010EBOV drug is within reach, and the EBOV epidemic may be under control in the near future (Figure 3).",
