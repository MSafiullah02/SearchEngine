Several coronaviruses (CoV) within the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus constantly circulate in the human population and cause mild respiratory disease. In addition, the betacoronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)- and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV can be zoonotically transmitted from animals to humans (1). Camels serve as a natural reservoir for MERS-CoV, and infected animals may exhibit mild respiratory symptoms (2, 3). In contrast, transmission of MERS-CoV to humans induces fatal disease in about 36% of the afflicted patients (4). Most MERS cases have been documented in the Middle East, but the virus has been introduced into several other countries due to international travel. At present, human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV is inefficient. However, massive MERS outbreaks have been observed in hospital settings (5). For instance, the introduction of MERS-CoV into the Republic of Korea by a single infected traveler in 2015 resulted in 186 infections, including secondary, tertiary, and quaternary cases, and 38 deaths (6, 7). Whether the virus responsible for the Korean outbreak harbored mutations that promoted human to human spread is incompletely understood.",

            "text": "The infectious entry of MERS-CoV into target cells is mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein (MERS-S), which is incorporated into the viral envelope. MERS-S contains a surface unit, S1, and a transmembrane unit, S2. The S1 subunit binds to the main receptor, DPP4/CD26 (8), and the secondary receptor, sialic acids (9), while the S2 subunit facilitates fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane. Membrane fusion depends on prior proteolytic cleavage (activation) of the inactive S protein precursor, S0, by host cell proteases. Specifically, the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L (CatL) and the type II transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2, located at the plasma membrane can activate MERS-S (10\u201312). Sequence analysis revealed that MERS-CoV variants observed during the Korean outbreak contained polymorphisms D510G and I529T and that the respective viral variants were transmitted to other patients (13, 14). The D510G and I529T polymorphisms are located in the receptor binding domain (RBD) (Fig. 1), a portion of S1 that is required for binding to DPP4, and one can speculate that they might increase viral fitness and/or transmissibility. However, counterintuitively, both D510G and I529T were shown to decrease binding to DPP4 and I529T was shown to decrease MERS-S-driven entry into cells (14), and it is at present unknown whether the virus benefits from these changes.",

Moreover, we confirm that D510G and I529T reduce DPP4 binding but show that this translates into reduced entry only when small amounts of DPP4 are expressed. Finally, we demonstrate that D510G and I529T reduce sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization, suggesting that these mutations might not alter viral transmissibility but might increase viral spread in infected patients in the presence of an antibody response.",

These cell lines were chosen for analysis because they are permissive to MERS-CoV infection and were previously used to study host cell interactions of MERS-CoV (22\u201325). The selected cell lines were highly permissive to transduction by rhabdoviral particles harboring VSV glycoprotein (VSV-G; positive control), while transduction by particles bearing no glycoprotein (negative control) was within background levels, as expected (Fig. 3A). Changes L411F and F473S observed in MERS-CoV from humans and camels in the Middle East had no effect on transduction efficiency. In contrast, changes I529T and, to a lesser degree, D510G observed in Korean MERS patients reduced entry into Vero E6 and 293T cells (Fig. 3A) and diminished binding to DPP4 (Fig. 3B), in agreement with published data (14). However, these mutations had only a modest effect on transduction of Caco-2 and 293T cells expressing saturating amounts of DPP4 (293T + DPP4), respectively (Fig. 3A and data not shown). The finding that directed expression of DPP4 could largely rescue the inhibitory effect of D510G and I529T on transduction of 293T cells prompted us to investigate whether the impact of these changes on S protein-driven entry was dependent on the level of DPP4 expression. Indeed, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 3C) and flow cytometry (Fig. 3D) revealed that Caco-2 and 293T + DPP4 cells, which can be readily transduced by MERS-S D510G and I529T variants, expressed substantially higher levels of DPP4 than 293T and Vero E6 cells, which are not readily susceptible to transduction mediated by S protein mutants D510G and I529T (Fig. 3C and D). Collectively, our results confirm that D510G and I529T reduce S protein binding to DPP4 but also suggest that this reduction translates into diminished S protein-driven cell entry only when DPP4 expression is low.",

Therefore, we investigated whether the polymorphisms under study modulated the capacity of MERS-S to employ CatL and TMPRSS2 for activation. For this, we first employed 293T cells, which express endogenous CatL but not TMPRSS2 and allow MERS-S-driven entry in a CatL-dependent fashion (10, 24). The cells were transfected with DPP4 plasmid and either TMPRSS2 encoding or empty plasmid (control), incubated with the CatL inhibitor MDL28170, and then analyzed for S protein-driven transduction. Incubation of control cells with MDL28170 reduced entry driven by MERS-S WT and S protein variants, and this effect was fully rescued by directed expression of TMPRSS2 (Fig. 5A). Next, we investigated S protein activation in Caco-2 cells, which express endogenous TMPRSS2 (27) and afforded the opportunity to visualize a potentially more subtle impact of the S protein polymorphisms on activation by TMPRSS2. However, incubation of Caco-2 cells with rising concentrations of camostat mesylate, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, comparably reduced entry driven by MERS-S WT and S protein variants and had no effect on VSV-G-mediated entry (Fig. 5B), as expected. These findings suggest that the polymorphisms under study did not compromise S protein activation by CatL and TMPRSS2 and did not endow the S protein with the ability to use low levels of TMPRSS2 activity with increased efficiency for S protein activation.",

Finally, comparable results were obtained with 293T cells transiently transfected with escalating amounts of IFTIM2 plasmid, although variant F473S showed a slightly reduced IFITM2 sensitivity under these conditions (data not shown).

Therefore, we asked whether the polymorphisms under study impact antibody-mediated neutralization. We focused our analysis on D510G and I529T since these changes modulated the efficiency of host cell entry. First, we tested whether D510G and I529T alter inhibition of S protein-driven entry by the murine antibody F11, which binds to an epitope encompassing amino acid 509, and macaque antibody JC57-14, which recognizes an epitope including amino acid 535 (29). Indeed, exchange D510G rendered MERS-S-driven entry insensitive to inhibition by F11, while I529T reduced blockade of S protein-driven entry by JC57-14 (Fig. 7A). These findings encouraged us to investigate whether D510G and I529T alter susceptibility of MERS-S-driven host cell entry to inhibition by human sera obtained from MERS patients. For this, we studied sera of three patients who had acquired MERS-CoV infection in the Middle East and were admitted to German hospitals in Essen (serum CSS16), Osnabr\u00fcck (CSS53), and Munich (CSS23) (Table 1). One serum sample was of sufficient quantity for detailed analysis (CSS53), while the others could be tested only at a single dilution (CSS16 and CSS23). Remarkably, MERS-S harboring polymorphism D510G showed a significantly increased resistance against neutralization by one serum sample (CSS16), and polymorphism I529T diminished neutralization by two sera (CSS16 and CSS53 [Fig. 7B and C]). Finally, neither mutation had any impact on neutralization by serum sample CSS23. However, the overall neutralizing activity of this particular serum sample was reduced compared to those of the other sera tested and might have been too low to allow for differential neutralization of MERS-S WT and mutants D510G and I529T. In summary, our results suggest that increased resistance against humoral immune responses might have driven the emergence of the D510G and I529T variants.",

Indeed, the majority of patients in Korea harbored viruses with at least one unique mutation in the RBD, D510G and/or I529T (13, 14). Unexpectedly, these mutations reduced DPP4 binding and viral entry (14), raising the question of whether they were beneficial to the virus. We found that D510G and I529T were compatible with robust S protein-driven entry into cells expressing large amounts of DPP4 and conferred resistance against antibody-mediated neutralization. These findings support the previously proposed concept that escape from antibody responses might shape MERS-CoV evolution and might come at the cost of reduced DPP4 binding (30). However, they also suggest that diminished DPP4 binding may not compromise the ability of MERS-CoV to spread in target cells expressing robust levels of DPP4.",

The case-fatality rate was roughly 20% and was thus lower than that reported for MERS patients in the Middle East. This may have various reasons, including differences in patient care and virulence of the MERS-CoV strains responsible for the outbreaks (14). The I529T mutation has been detected in 72% of patients in Korea examined by one study and might have already been present in the index patient (14). Similarly, the S protein sequences from 26 out of 38 patients deposited in the virus variation database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/variation/) contain the I529T change. Moreover, viruses harboring this mutation established secondary, tertiary, and quaternary infections (13, 14). In contrast, the D510G mutation was present in only 8% of patients analyzed in a previous study, and 6 out of 38 S protein sequences (16%) deposited in the virus variation database contained this exchange. Kim and colleagues reported that D510G and particularly I529T diminish binding of MERS-S to DPP4 and reduce entry into 293T cells transfected to express DPP4 (14). Moreover, structural evidence that these mutations disturb the interface between DPP4 and MERS-S was presented (14). However, it remained unclear whether these mutations may also aid virus spread under certain conditions.",

Moreover, patients with chronic lung disease were shown to express increased levels of DPP4 (32, 33) and are known to be at augmented risk of developing fatal MERS (34), suggesting that DPP4 levels expressed under physiologic conditions might limit viral spread in patients. Therefore, we investigated whether the previously reported negative effect of D510G and I529T on MERS-S-driven entry was dependent on DPP4 expression levels. Our results show that this is indeed the case: both mutations markedly reduced entry into 293T cells, which expressed low levels of endogenous DPP4 mRNA and protein, but had little effect on entry into Caco-2 cells, which express large amounts of DPP4. Robust expression of DPP4 has been detected in viral target cells in the human respiratory epithelium, type I and type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages (8, 32), and it is thus conceivable that WT virus and virus bearing D510G or I529T infect these cells with comparable efficiencies in the lung of MERS patients. Finally, one can speculate that engagement of attachment-promoting factors expressed in viral target cells in the human respiratory tract but not the cell lines studied here might allow mutants D510G and I529T to compensate for reduced DPP4 binding and to enter cells with the same efficiency as WT virus.",

Therefore, we addressed whether D510G and I529T might augment viral spread by promoting S protein activation or by changing the choice of S protein-activating protease. Two interconnected routes have been described for MERS-S activation. Upon binding to DPP4, either the virus may be transported into host cell endosomes, where the S protein is activated by cathepsin L, or the S protein may be activated at the cell surface by TMPRSS2 (10, 11, 24). Notably, the choice between CatL and TMPRSS2 might be determined by S protein processing in the infected cell: S protein cleavage by furin in infected cells seems to be indispensable for subsequent DPP4-induced conformational changes in the S protein that are in turn essential for activation by TMPRSS2 (36). The present study demonstrates that D510G and I529T impact neither S protein cleavage by furin nor S protein activation by TMPRSS2 or CatL. This finding may not be unexpected since both residues are located distant to the two sites believed to be important for S protein processing and activation, R751 (S1/S2 site) and R887 (S2\u2032 site).",

The DPP4 ligand adenosine deaminase, which is highly expressed in lymphoid tissue and constitutes a component of the purine salvage pathway (37), has been shown to compete with MERS-S for DPP4 binding and to block MERS-S-driven entry into target cells (31). Moreover, the IFN-induced transmembrane proteins IFITM2 and, to a lesser degree, IFITM3 were demonstrated to block MERS-S-driven entry, at least upon overexpression (28). Finally, MERS-S has been shown to bind to a coreceptor, sialic acid, which promotes viral entry into target cells (9). Our results indicate that D510G and I529T do not impact the above-named processes, suggesting that both mutations might affect neither viral attachment to cells nor the membrane fusion reaction.",

Neutralizing antibodies can be directed against the RBD and interfere with viral entry by blocking DPP4/S protein interactions. A previous study conducted with cell culture systems found that MERS-CoV can acquire mutations that allow escape from RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies but also provided evidence that such mutations might come at the cost of decreased DPP4 binding and viral fitness (30). Such a scenario generally matches our findings that D510G and I529T render the S protein at least partially resistant against neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and sera from MERS patients and reduce DPP4 binding. However, our results also allow the speculation that reduced DPP4 binding might not necessarily translate into reduced viral spread in host cells expressing high levels of DPP4. This possibility awaits confirmation with infectious MERS-CoV and primary target cells. Nevertheless, it would be in keeping with the observation that viruses harboring the I529T change were robustly transmitted between patients during the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea (14), although the I529T change did not provide the virus with an advantage in the absence of humoral responses. Finally, our finding that single point mutations in MERS-S can increase resistance to antibody-mediated neutralization highlights the need to develop vaccines and therapeutics that simultaneously target multiple epitopes in MERS-S.",
