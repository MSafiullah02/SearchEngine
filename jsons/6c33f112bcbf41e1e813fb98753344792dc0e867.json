            "text": "GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASE IS the most common cause of sickness in foals (Baldwin, Cooper, Vanderwall and Erb 1991) ; however, it is only recently that field studies have been conducted to determine the causes of infectious diarrhoea outbreaks. The investigation reported by Browning et a1 (p 405) documents the importance of rotavirus as a cause of foal diarrhoea in the U.K. and Ireland, and also raises the question of the role of Aeromonas hydrophila in gastroenteritis. Similar studies in the United States have shown that rotavirus is a predominant cause of enteritis in foals (Conner and Darlington 1980; Dwyer et a1 1990) . The virus was the topic of a recent international workshop to address the current knowledge and future research needs (Rotavirus Workshop Proceedings 1989). Rotavirus can cause disease without being an opportunist or secondary pathogen (Higgins et a1 1988) and is species specific under natural conditions. Studies of serotypes in the United States indicate that serotype 3 predominates (Hardy et a1 1991) . This also has been confirmed with rotavirus isolates from the U.K. and Ireland (Snodgrass 1991) and Japan (Imagawa et a1 1991); however, low numbers of other rotavirus serotypes were detected in both studies, and 23/70 isolates were untypable (Snodgrass 1991) .",

How many serotypes exist, and how do the local intestinal and systemic immunity interact to protect against disease? Does rotavirus play a role in the gastric ulcer syndrome of foals? The onset of hot humid weather has preceded reported outbreaks (Baldwin, Cooper and Higgins 1990; Dwyer, unpublished data) . Can weather conditions influence virus dissemination or is it stress on the foals that predisposes them to infection and subsequent disease? Could the high number of foals on farms during April and May cause 'stress' in foals making them more susceptible to infectious diarrhoea? Or does a true carrier state exist in mares and/or foals, in which case the large number of animals .present in the midst of the foaling season merely increases the chances of healthy foals contacting the virus from asymptomatic shedders.",

A point to consider is that in the study by Browning's group and in an earlier study by Dwyer et a1 (1990) , only 50 per cent of diarrhoeic cases were diagnosed as caused by a specific aetiological agent. Although this may seem a low figure, a similar percentage was identified in diarrhoeic cases among infants and adults (Centers for Disease Control, 1990 ). Other agents have been associated with foal diarrhoea, but due to diagnostic constraints are only rarely reported. These include parvovirus, coronavirus, Bacteroides fr-agilis and toxigenic clostridial organisms. Ongoing questions also revolve around the pathogenicity of E . coli (Hart et a1 199 1 ) and cryptosporidia.",

Bovine colostrum products fed to piglets have been shown to be protective against rotavirus diarrhoea when piglets were challenged subsequently with virus (Bridger and Brown 1981) , and this form of passive immunity may be a rational means of preventing disease among foals. Although vaccination of mares and supplemental passive immunity in foals show promise in the prevention of rotavirus diarrhoea, efficacy under field conditions remains unknown. Until a proven product is available commercially the prevention and control of infectious diarrhoea rests with the fundamentals of rigorous disinfection, hygiene and sound management practices. The success of these techniques under field conditions has been documented (Traub-Dargatz et a1 1998; Baldwin et a1 1990; Dwyer 1991) . A vaccine by itself will not erase rotavirus from the list of yearly problems encountered on studfarms.",
