That review highlighted the extreme lack of available chemotherapeutics that show any inhibitory effects against the virus. In contrast, the emergence of numerous models and solved crystal structures of CHIKV proteins points to enormous possibilities for directed drug design. Notable among the available targets are the envelope proteins [12\u201315] and the nonstructural proteins of CHIKV, which play an important role in the formation of the transcription/replication complex of the virus [15, 16]. Among these, nsP3 is considered an attractive target for drug design because of its participation in the early stage of the transcription process of viral replication, even though the specific functions, roles, and activities of the nsP3 protein remain elusive [16, 17].",

            "text": "To date, there have been relatively few studies on the functions, roles, and activities of alphavirus nsP3 proteins [11, 18\u201320]. Studies based on the Sindbis virus reported that nsP3 phosphoprotein is an essential component of the viral replication and transcription process. Functional analysis of the effects of mutations of nsP3 on RNA synthesis demonstrated that the mutations can cause a loss of capacity for minus-strand synthesis or a failure to increase plus-strand synthesis. Strikingly, a change in G4303 implying an alteration from Gly to Ala68 and leading to a modification to the His-Ala-Val peptide was predicted to form part of the active site of the conserved nsP3 macro domain [19]. However, no effect of the mutations on the ADP-ribose binding site was found [17]. The nsP3 protein consists of two domains, the N-domain and the C-domain [16, 17]; the N-domain is highly conserved but the C-domain is not [17]. The C-domain is phosphorylated at up to 16 positions on serines and threonines [11, 17]. The role of this phosphorylation is still not clear, but deleting the residues involved in the phosphorylation process can decrease the level of RNA synthesis [11, 17, 21]. The N-domain, in which the region comprising the first 160 residues is called the X-domain or a macro domain, is commonly present in eukaryotic organisms, bacteria, archaea, and in many positive-strand RNA viruses such as hepatitis E, rubella, coronaviruses, and alphaviruses [16]. The alphavirus macro domain has a highly positively charged patch on the surface of the protein at the crevice of the ADP-ribose 1\u2033-phosphate active site and its periphery [17]. The other side of the protein, far from the active site, possesses a negative charge. Thus, the nsP3 macro domain is considered to complex with ADP-ribose derivatives and RNA. It is also believed to control the metabolism of ADP-ribose 1\u2033-phosphate and/or other ADP-ribose derivatives with regulatory functions in the cell [11, 22].",

            "text": "The crystal structure of the nsP3 macro domain of CHIKV was solved in 2010 [17]. The asymmetric unit of CHIKV includes four molecules. The macro domain consists of six-stranded \u03b2-sheets and four \u03b1-helices, and the positions of the \u03b1-helices are highly conserved. Also present is the ligand ADP-ribose, and the active site of the nsP3 macro domain is considered the binding site for this ADP-ribose ligand [16, 17]. This crevice is at the top of \u03b2-strands 2, 4, and 5 and is surrounded by two loops between \u03b22-\u03b11 and \u03b25-\u03b13. Since there is very little information available on the nsP3 macro domain and its inhibitor, the current study used computational approaches (including molecular docking and virtual screening) to discover potential compounds that inhibit nsP3 in CHIKV. Furthermore, in order to understand both the static structures and the dynamic information, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to gain a greater understanding of the behavior of nsP3 and how it changes upon the binding of small molecules. The results of the study were analyzed and compared with previous data to gain a deeper understanding of the atomic structure of the nsP3 macro domain and its complexes, as well as to confirm the interactions and results from docking.",

            "text": "Molecular docking and virtual screening were conducted using AutoDock Vina (version 1.5.4) [23]. In the current study, the protein was treated as rigid, while the ligands were fully flexible. The protein was prepared by retrieving the 3D crystal structure of the nsP3 macro domain protein from the Protein Data Bank (PDB id: 3GPG), and this was used as the receptor for docking. The ligand ADP-ribose was extracted from the complex crystal structure (PDB id: 3GPO), whereas other ligands employed for virtual screening were downloaded from the website of the Diversity Set II chemical library of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). This library was selected as it contains diverse drug-like compounds, and potential hits can be ordered from the Open Chemical Repository Collection for activity testing. The protein was subsequently minimized by applying the CHARMM force field in the Accelrys Discovery Studio 2.0 software package [24]. The steepest-descent algorithm with 3,000 steps was used to relax the structure and remove steric overlaps. With a C\u03b1 RMSD of 0.59 \u00c5 between the minimized structure and the X-ray structure, the minimized structure was utilized for the docking process. Polar hydrogen atoms were added and the Kollman charges were defined with AutoDock Tools (version 1.5.4). The key docking parameters include the location of the docking site (center x, y, z) and the size of the grid box. The docking protocol was established by re-docking the ADP-ribose into nsP3 as seen in the co-crystal structure (3GPO). In the docking with ADP-ribose, box dimensions of 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 16 \u00c5 were used, centered at the crystallographically determined binding site. In virtual screening, the location and the size of the grid box were carefully investigated via blind docking (in which the box is sufficiently large to cover the whole protein) and focused docking (in which a smaller box was centered on the potential binding site of interest). Blind docking can reveal potential binding sites in nsP3, but it can also suffer convergence problems during sampling. The MetaPocket program was also used to predict potential binding sites of nsP3 other than the active site [25]. After docking, the results were analyzed and compared with available experimental data. The top ten compounds (\u201chits\u201d) were identified according to their binding affinities using the default scoring function in Vina. The modes of interaction between the ligands and the protein were analyzed in Accelrys Discovery Studio 2.0. The drug-like properties of these compounds were subsequently evaluated using the Lipinski guidelines [26].",

MD simulations were carried out for the apo state (PDB id: 3GPG) and the five ligand\u2013nsP3 complexes. The systems were solvated in a cubic box of TIP3P water molecules and neutralized by sodium counterions to achieve the physiological ionic concentration of 0.15 M with NaCl. The total number of atoms (including protein, water, and counterions) in the CHIKV system was about 18,000, and the size of the water box was about 58 \u00d7 58 \u00d7 58 \u00c5. All simulations were performed under periodic boundary conditions at a temperature of 298.15 K and a pressure of 1 atm. Temperature and pressure coupling were maintained with the Langevin algorithm. A particle mesh Ewald algorithm was used to calculate electrostatic interactions [30]. The cutoff distance for van der Waals interactions and the pair-list distance were 12 and 13.5 \u00c5, respectively. The systems were minimized and then equilibrium simulations with weak harmonic restraints on the heavy atoms were performed for 3 ns. The production runs were continued for 20 ns. The trajectories were saved every 1 ps. The resulting trajectories were analyzed using the CHARMM [31] and VMD 1.9 programs [32].",

Among the top ten hits, four are shared between VST1 and VST2, which differ in the size of the grid box used. Given our interest in finding more inhibitors as well as other potential binding sites in the structure of nsP3, we used blind docking to dock into the entire protein, with the grid box centered on the middle of either the ADP-ribose binding site (VST3) or the protein (VST4). For the blind docking (VST3 and VST4), six of the top ten hits are common to VST3 and VST4, and the binding affinities were reproduced to within 1.0 kcal mol\u22121. This indicates that the blind dockings are likely to have converged.

The locations of the three binding sites along with the top five compounds obtained from VST are displayed in detail in Fig. 3 (for more information, see Fig. S1 of the ESM). It is also interesting that the majority of the hit compounds show tighter binding in pocket 1 than in pocket 2. Detailed analyses of the interactions between the ligands and the protein target were carried out by characterizing the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts [34]. The results show that hydrogen-bonding interactions play a more important role in the binding to pocket 1, whereas hydrophobic contacts are responsible for the interactions associated with the binding to pocket 2. In agreement with this, it was previously reported [16] that the residues Ser110, Thr111, Gly112, and Tyr114 define pocket 1 and are key residues in interactions with ligands.

It is worth noting that four residues, namely Val33, Val113, Tyr114, and Trp148, play a crucial role in stabilizing the complexes by facilitating hydrophobic interactions between the ligands and nsP3 at binding pockets 1 and 3, while Ala1, Pro2, and Tyr4 are important in pocket 2. The solvent accessible surface areas (SASAs) were calculated to monitor the possible changes in the solvation environment upon ligand binding (Table 5). We expected to see that the SASA for hydrophobically interacting residues in the protein\u2013ligand complex will decrease compared to those in the apoprotein. In pocket 1, when the ligands bind to the protein, it can be seen that the solvent surface of residue Tyr114 decreases from 70.2 \u00c52 in the apo nsP3 to 63.4 \u00c52 for the nsP3\u2013NCI_61610 complex and 63.8 \u00c52 for the nsP3\u2013NCI_345647_a complex. Also, the SASA of Val33 reduces from 68.8 \u00c52 in the apo state to 57.4 \u00c52 and 52.9 \u00c52 for the bound state in nsP3\u2013NCI_25457 and NCI_345647_a, respectively. However, it is apparent that the changes in SASA for Val33, Val113, and Trp148 are not consistent for different ligands. This can be rationalized by noting that these residues are able to form not only hydrophobic contacts but also polar hydrogen-bonding interactions. Thus, the change in SASA is compromised by polar interactions, and both types of interaction modulate the SASA.\n\n",

These results are listed in Tables S3 and S4 of the ESM. The binding affinities observed in these docking runs (Table S3 of the ESM) were not significantly different from those obtained in previous dockings based on the X-ray structure. Additionally, the binding modes observed in the dockings based on the X-ray structure are similar to those obtained based on the MD sampled structures.

It is also the first to combine molecular docking, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics simulations to identify potential inhibitors that target CHIKV by taking advantage of the recently determined high-resolution crystal structure of nsP3 in complex with ADP-ribose. Considering the presence of positive charge at the ADP-ribose-binding site, this binding pocket may have the tendency to accommodate negatively charged ligands, which may not have acceptable pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, we decided to identify all possible binding pockets based on the available methods. We first re-docked the ADP-ribose and successfully reproduced the bound structure and the key residues for interactions in the ADP-ribose-binding pocket. It was evident that the binding affinity of ADP-ribose was less than \u221210 kcal mol\u22121, showing that this negatively charged ligand binds very tightly to nsP3.

Pocket 3 partially overlapped with pocket 1, while pocket 2 was located on the opposite side of the protein (Fig. 3). A comparison of the binding affinities at the three different binding pockets revealed that all of the hits for pocket 1 bind to the protein well, with binding affinities of less than \u221210 kcal mol\u22121. This suggests that pocket 1 is the most favorable for ligand binding. In contrast, pocket 2 may not be a good location for binding compared to pockets 1 and 3 because it is associated with higher binding affinities. It is also interesting to note that some ligands were repeated multiple times in the list of virtual screening results. These ligands can bind to different pockets in different conformations (e.g., the ligand NCI_127133 binds to pockets 1 and 2, ligand NCI_670283 binds to pockets 1 and 3, and ligand NCI_293778 binds to pockets 1, 2, and 3).
