Previous epidemiology report uncovered that the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has doubled every 7.4 day in its early stage, with an average serial interval of 7.5 days [3]. Early information estimated that the basic reproductive number R0 was estimated to be 1.4 \u2013 2.5 reported by WHO [2]. The pandemic is accelerating at an exponential rate and at risk of escalating into a global health emergency [2]. The mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in China is approximately 2.3%, compared with 9.6% of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and 34.4% of middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) reported by WHO [6]. Even this virus is not as fetal as people thought, the transmissibility is far exceeding that of SARS and MERS [7]. Although many clinical and epidemiological literatures have been published [3\u20136, 8\u201310], the spread in still ongoing and the early warning parameters for disease progression remain incomplete.",

The imaging performance on chest CT scans from COVID-19 patients mainly manifested as bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the lung periphery [13]. In a retrospective cohort, chest CTs of 121 symptomatic COVID-19 patients have been reviewed. Bilateral lung involvement was observed in 10/36 early patients (28%), 25/33 intermediate patients (76%), and 22/25 late patients (88%) [11]. Currently, chest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia [14]. In a cohort study, 85.7% (54/63) confirmed COVID-19 patients developed imaging progression including enlarged and increased extent of GGOs and consolidation at early follow-up chest CT scans [12]. That is, short-term imaging progression on chest CT from COVID-19 patients should be early predicted and intervened.",

Additionally, acid glycoprotein was significantly lower in imaging progression patients (p = 0.037, Table 1). In liver function tests, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels were significantly higher in imaging progression-free patients (p = 0.045, Table 1), while homocysteine levels were significantly higher in imaging progression patients (p = 0.006, Table1). In kidney function tests, urea, creatinine and serum cystatin C levels were significantly higher in imaging progression patients compared to those in imaging progression-free ones (p = 0.011, p = 0.007, respectively, Table 1).

Generally, imaging manifestations are in line with the severity of COVID-19 [16]. Hence, a short-term follow up with identification of imaging progression is of great importance for early warning of disease aggravation from COVID-19 patients, which could help clinicians to manage quickly and accurately [12].

Our results also revealed that the average age of patients with imaging progression was older than those without. Logistic model confirmed that age should be a risk factor for predicting imaging progression. Previous reports suggested that COVID-19 is more susceptible to infect older adults [3, 8, 10]. Research with small samples of 2019-nCoV infected infants have been reported [17]. In a study included 34 COVID-19 children, the authors concluded that the clinical manifestations in children with 2019-nCoV infection are non-specific and are milder than that in adults [18]. In a nationwide retrospective study, 2143 pediatric patients were included. They found that more than 90% patients were asymptomatic, mild, or moderate, even though young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable to infection [19]. The first deaths of COVID-19 occurred frequently among elderly people, who may progress more faster [20]. In a multicenter cohort study with 137 patients enrolled, age was shown to be associated with high risk of death in COVID-19 patients. Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are prone to respiratory failure and have a poorer prognosis [21, 22]. Combined the previous literatures and our results, we assumed that age also should be a risk factor for imaging progression at the early stage of COVID-19.",

Previous evidence demonstrated that monocytes/macrophages were susceptible to human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E infection, but strongly restricted OC43 replication [23]. Differs from HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV poorly infects human purified monocytes/macrophages, and production of interferon-alpha by these cells further limits the infection [24]. Following infection of monocytes/macrophages by HCoV-OC43, viability remained high over 6 days and no apoptosis was observed [25]. These clues suggested that monocytes might be stable in function and quantity levels during HCoV infection like SARS and 2019-CoV. Conversely, SARS-CoV frequently targets for cytotoxic T lymphocytes [26, 27]. Lymphopenia is one of hematological abnormalities during SARS-CoV infection, and lymphocyte counts could predict the severity and clinical outcomes [28]. Previous study showed that lymphocytes and its subsets significantly decreased in SARS patients, while those with severe clinical illness or those who died had more remarkable CD4+ and CD8+ lymphopenia [28]. Also, MERS-CoV could efficiently infected T lymphocytes from the peripheral blood and from human lymphoid organs and induced apoptosis in T lymphocytes [29]. Similar with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV infection also related with loss of lymphocytes, which was supported by Chinese guidelines [30, 31]. Thus, the MLR increased especially in patients with disease progression.",
