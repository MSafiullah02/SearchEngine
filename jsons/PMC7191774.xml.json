After general questions on local practices, we asked each center for their diagnostic methods for microbial screening in recipients and donors. The clinical cases were related to specific issues concerning the management of antibiotic therapy in different clinical situations, including no prior colonization, prior colonization with MDR microorganisms (defined as non-susceptibility to at least 1 agent in 3 or more antimicrobial categories) [17], colonization definition, local tuberculoid granuloma in the lung explant, and prior colonization with MDR bacteria not susceptible to beta-lactams (complete survey in Additional file 1, raw answer data in Additional file 2). We hypothesized that, first, practices vary widely according to centers, and second, that antibiotic choices and duration of use may be different according to prior colonization, lung underlying diseases, and the profiles of sensitivity of the isolated bacteria in pre-transplant.",

It is still debated whether MDR bacteria are more problematic than wild-type agents. Recently, a study from the ISHLT registry demonstrated a similar survival rate in cystic fibrosis lung transplant recipients infected with organisms labeled pan-resistant despite more infection episodes [8]. Although, in this study, there are no precise data about the bacterial species or the antibiotic treatments, most of the centers did not consider MDR bacteria a contraindication to transplantation, except in the context of pan-resistance, which is still considered at higher risk. For some species like Burkholderia cenocepacia many studies reported an increased mortality after LTx and for that reason, this colonization has been considered a contraindication in some centers [38\u201340]. Aguado et al. [41] recently recommended that MDR bacteria should not constitute a contraindication to transplantation but highlighted the importance of characterizing the isolate\u2019s phenotypic and genotypic resistance profile to better guide treatment.",

Some respondents (mainly surgeons) were not in charge of antibiotic management, and thus, in those cases, the answers might maybe not reflect the real practice of these centers. The question of the survey is complex and the practice varies widely from one center to another. Thus it was really challenging to cover all aspects of the problematic and in order not to make the questions too long, we sometimes limited the choice of answers and certain situations may have been neglected. For instance, the route of administration was not always specified when asking for an antibiotic strategy. Moreover, not all 180 centers contacted have responded to the survey, but we received a global response rate of 55%. The response rate from Western Europe was the highest (62%), but some countries with experience in LTx, such as the United Kingdom and Germany, did not participate well in the survey (33 and 27%, respectively). We received no answer from China. Because we did not screen centers in advance for eligibility, it is likely that some of the nonresponders would have been ineligible (because they do not perform LTx). Furthermore, some centers may be not used to complex infectious situations since most centers perform LTx for fibrosis (61%) and may not be used to cystic fibrosis, which entails a more complex risk.",

It could be interesting now to evaluate in further appropriate randomized studies the use of antibiotics in perioperative of a LTx.

And second, the duration of the postoperative antibiotic use on the prevention of postoperative infections on one hand, and on the selection of MDR strains or the occurrence of Clostridioides difficile infections on the other hand.",
