The pandemic of COVID-19 has placed an enormous burden on health authorities across the world. The virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019-nCoV), causes acute respiratory disease with common signs of infection being respiratory symptoms, fever, cough and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection causes pneumonia, lung failure, septic shock, organ failure and risk of death. The WHO reports that 80% of those infected will develop mild symptoms, 14% severe symptoms and 6% will become critically ill. Given the wide clinical spectrum of COVID-19, a key challenge faced by frontline clinical staff is prioritisation of stretched resources. Thus, there is a critical need for robust risk assessment for clinical management.",

All patients had been diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance and had radiologic evidence of pneumonia or infiltrates on chest CT scan according. The criteria for patient discharge was the absence of fever for at least 3 days, substantial improvement in both lungs on chest CT, clinical remission of respiratory symptoms, and two throat-swab samples negative for viral RNA obtained at least 24 hours apart. In total, 99 patients (61 pneumonia and 38 severe pneumonia) with key information in their medical records were included in this study. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were extracted from electronic medical records. Risk factors that affect disease severity and length of hospital stay were investigated with appropriate statistical methods using R (V3.6.1) or GraphPad Prism (V8.2.1).",

Given that ACE2 levels are increased in hypertensive patients treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs) (4, 5), Fang and colleagues proposed the hypothesis that ACE2-stimulating drugs could potentially increase the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19 (6) . In this study, we found hypertension is a risk factor for severe cases, independent of age and other variables. We managed to trace 34 hypertensive patients in this cohort. We found 1 out of 14 COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and 4 out of 20 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia are on ACEIs/ARBs. The impact of ACEIs/ARBs on disease severity is inconclusive due to small number, but it does suggest a larger cohort study is demanded.",

The Chinese Thoracic Society has developed an expert consensus statement on the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients (10), in which low-to-moderate dose of corticosteroids in short courses for critically ill COVID-19 patients is recommended. However, there are potential risks associated with corticosteroids, such as secondary infections and prolonged virus shedding (8) . In our study, the log-rank test suggested glucocorticoids use led to a prolonged length of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients, which discourages its use.",
