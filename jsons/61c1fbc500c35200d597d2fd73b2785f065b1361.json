            "text": "Bats (Order Chiroptera) are an abundant group of mammals with tremendous ecological value as insectivores and plant dispersers, but their role as reservoirs of zoonotic diseases has received more attention in the last decade. With the goal of managing disease in free-ranging bats, we tested modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and raccoon poxvirus (RCN) as potential vaccine vectors in the Brazilian Free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis), using biophotonic in vivo imaging and immunogenicity studies. Animals were administered recombinant poxviral vectors expressing the luciferase gene (MVA-luc, RCN-luc) through oronasal (ON) or intramuscular (IM) routes and subsequently monitored for bioluminescent signal indicative of viral infection. No clinical illness was noted after exposure to any of the vectors, and limited luciferase expression was observed. Higher and longer levels of expression were observed with the RCNluc construct. When given IM, luciferase expression was limited to the site of injection, while ON exposure led to initial expression in the oral cavity, often followed by secondary replication at another location, likely the gastric mucosa or gastric associated lymphatic tissue. Viral DNA was detected in oral swabs up to 7 and 9 days post infection (dpi) for MVA and RCN, respectively. While no live virus was detected in oral swabs from MVA-infected bats, titers up to 3.88 x 10 4 PFU/ml were recovered from oral swabs of RCN-infected bats. Viral DNA was also detected in fecal samples from two bats inoculated IM with RCN, but no live virus was recovered. Finally, we examined the immunogenicity of a RCN based rabies vaccine (RCN-G) following ON administration. Significant rabies neutralizing antibody titers were detected in the serum of immunized bats using the rapid fluorescence focus inhibition test (RFFIT). These studies highlight the safety and immunogenicity of attenuated poxviruses and their potential use as vaccine vectors in bats.",

The list of pathogens that infect bats includes the major mammalian paramyxoviruses [2] , coronaviruses [3, 4] , filoviruses [5] [6] [7] , distinct influenza lineages [8, 9] , hepadnaviruses [10] , and hantaviruses [11] , as well as lyssaviruses such as rabies virus [12, 13] . In the United States, bats are often the most common source of rabies infections in humans [14] , and in Central and South America, rabies transmitted by vampire bats is a serious zoonotic and economic issue [15] . This association between bats and pathogens that significantly impacts human populations has increased public fear and misunderstanding of these animals and lead to culling campaigns [15] [16] [17] [18] . Unfortunately, culling campaigns often lead to the death of valuable non-target bat species [16] and appear ineffective in reducing disease incidence [17] . Alternatively, vaccination of other wildlife http species has been successful in mitigating the public health impact of rabies with the development of efficient and practical distribution methods for mass immunization.",

            "text": "Poxviral vectors have been used extensively for oral vaccines to control infectious diseases in a variety of animal species over the last 25 years [19, 20] . Several advantages of poxviruses as vaccine vectors include: (1) their allowance of large insertions of foreign DNA; (2) ease of manufacturing; (3) thermal and genetic stability; (4) safety and infectivity for multiple target species; and (5) ability to infect via mucosal and dermal routes. For example, an oral rabies vaccine, constructed by inserting the rabies G glycoprotein into vaccinia virus and distributed via baits, has been used for many years to curtail rabies outbreaks in foxes, raccoons and other animals in North America and Europe [21] . Previous studies assessing a vaccinia-based rabies vaccine (VR-G) in Desmodus bats demonstrated the protective efficacy of that construct [22] [23] [24] . However, this vector has undesirable side-effects, especially in immunocompromised individuals [25] , necessitating the development of attenuated virus strains. More recently, an oral sylvatic plague vaccine using another poxvirus (raccoon pox, RCN) was shown to protect prairie dogs and is currently being tested in large-scale field trials [26, 27] . RCN was first isolated from the upper respiratory tract of apparently healthy raccoons in North America [28] . It has since been shown to be safe and effective in a variety of species, including domestic cats, piglets, dogs, raccoons, skunks, foxes, bobcats, rabbits, sheep, prairie dogs, nonhuman primates, and chickens, with none of the immunized animals showing clinical side effects [29] [30] [31] [32] . Additionally, RCN has been shown to be immunogenic via non-parenteral routes in both domestic species [29] and free ranging wildlife [33, 34] . Another orthopoxvirus vector, modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA), is a highly attenuated form of vaccinia [35, 36] and has also been demonstrated to safely and effectively induce immunity [37, 38] .",

After acclimating to captivity, the bats were transferred to NWHC (Madison, Wisconsin, USA), where all bat studies were conducted under ABSL-3 conditions. Upon transfer to the NWHC, bats were maintained in flight cages for a quarantine period of 30 days. During this time blood samples were taken and bats were treated topically for parasites. Electronic microchip identification units (Avid Identification Systems, Inc., Folsom, Louisiana, USA) were inserted into each animal, between the scapulae, via subcutaneous injection. Bats were maintained on mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) supplemented with vitamins and an omega fatty acids mixture, and water was available ad libitum.

Bats were scanned prior to infection and confirmed to have no auto-luminescence beyond background levels. Imaging was conducted at roughly the same time period each day, midway through the bats' active period. On imaging days the bats were separated individually into paper lunch bags, weighed, and injected intraperitoneally (i.p) with d-luciferin (Potassium-Luciferin, Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO 63132, dose: 150 mg/kg) at 14 min prior to imaging the ON group and 26 min prior to imaging the IM group, which were empirically determined to be the time of peak luminescence post substrate exposure on the first day of imaging. All bats were examined for signs of disease or discomfort at the time of substrate injection. For imaging, animals were anesthetized by chamber-delivered isoflurane and positioned in the imager in dorsal recumbency with wings extended laterally, where they were maintained on mask-delivered isoflurane. After imaging the anesthesia was ceased, bats were monitored and given thermal support during recovery. After 11 dpi the bats with remaining detectable luminescence were imaged every 3 days until luminescence was below detectable levels. Images were collected and analyzed using Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences, Alameda, California, USA).

Two routes were assessed; the IM route and the ON route, which is most biologically relevant for wildlife vaccination. Throughout the study, no clinical signs of disease, lesions, or significant weight loss were observed after administration of viral vectors (Fig. S2, Table S3 ). All bats infected with luc-expressing poxvirus vectors had detectable expression of luminescence by 1 dpi, and peak levels were observed at 1 and 3 dpi for the IM and ON routes, respectively ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). Viral infection via IM exposure was cleared within 7 days for MVA and 9 days for RCN, while infection after ON exposure was cleared within 9 days for MVA and 21 days for RCN (final images for RCN given ON not shown). Statistical analysis revealed that luminescence was significantly higher (P = 0.028) in bats that received RCN compared to MVA and significantly higher (P = 0.032) for those administered virus by the IM route compared to the ON route. In the IM injected groups, significant viral spread to other areas was not evident. In contrast, an initial site of viral replication was evident in the oral cavity after ON exposure, often followed by a secondary site of expression further down the gastrointestinal tract. All luminescence measurements are listed in Table S4 .",

Instead, efforts are more focused on culling of populations (e.g. vampire bats in Latin America) or controlling disease after spill-over into other animal hosts. The continued spillover of rabies virus strains to humans and domestic animals from terrestrial carnivores has led to the development of successful oral rabies vaccination (ORV) programs in Europe and North America. These campaigns often utilize recombinant viral vectors that stimulate immunity to the surface glycoprotein of rabies when ingested orally. When distributed in baits targeted toward certain rabies-carrying species, these vaccines lead to protection from the virus and reduction in local incidence of disease, and even local eradication of some strains of rabies [20, 51] . ORV programs are continually evolving and making use of the best available vaccine technology and disease modeling studies. In this study we assessed whether two attenuated poxviruses might be viable vaccine vectors in a bat species.",

We show evidence of limited autologous spread of the viruses after ON exposure, although there is no evidence that the virus spreads outside of GI-associated tissues. MVA was cleared faster and resulted in less detectable luminescence compared to RCN, which may be expected due to the highly attenuated nature of MVA. The lack of significant difference in the levels of viral encoded protein (luciferase) production upon re-infection with RCN, as shown in the booster study (Fig. 3) , may be important if bats had been previously exposed to RCN, or if boost inoculations of RCN-vectored vaccine are necessary. While neither vector caused clinical illness, the fact that RCN produced more viral encoded protein (luciferase) over a longer period suggests it is a more immunogenic vector when expressing heterologous antigens. Due to limitations of this study, we were not able to compare the immunogenicity of the vectors directly.",

In future work, topical vehicles will be developed that could be used to deliver oral vaccines to the fur coat of bats as they roost or are otherwise congregated. Bats are fastidious animals and spend a large proportion of their time self-grooming [53] , which could lead to significant oral exposure to topically applied vaccines. A vaccine that would broadly protect free-ranging bats from rabies virus infection may reduce local incidence of rabies in certain bat populations, limiting the amount of spill-over into humans and other species. T. brasiliensis represents a species that roosts in dense colonies and is exposed to significant levels of circulating rabies virus in their population that may result in human exposures [54] . Therefore, a topically delivered rabies vaccine may be directly applicable to this species, but only if a method for mass application (such as a spray) could be developed. Further research is required to assess the viral vector in other species, such as vampire bats (Desmodus spp.), for which topically distributed poison protocols are well developed for culling of colonies [15, 55] . While culling has been successful in reducing overall numbers of Desmodus at a local level, it has not reduced the incidence of rabies in bat populations and may indeed be counterproductive [17] . Development of topical poxvirus vectored vaccines could potentially lead to effective, applicable, and practical means for reducing disease burden in some free ranging bat populations.",

DNA was extracted from 40 ll of the samples using the Zymo Quick-gDNA TM MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA 92614, U.S.A.), and a PCR assay was run to assess for presence of the inoculated virus. PCR was performed with OneTaq \u00d2 Quick-Load \u00d2 2X Master Mix with Standard Buffer (New England BioLabs Inc., Ipswich, MA 01938, USA) and primers targeting the luc insert flanks [Supplemental info]. The limit of detection for this PCR protocol was determined to be 0.125 picograms of DNA, or 6.8x10 4 copies, as determined by serial dilution of a known quantity of viral DNA. Any samples positive by PCR were then assessed for levels of live virus by determining the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ). For RCN-luc samples, positive wells were assessed by plaque observation, and the TCID 50 was calculated and used to approximate plaque forming units (PFU)/ml by the Spearman & K\u00e4rber algorithm",
