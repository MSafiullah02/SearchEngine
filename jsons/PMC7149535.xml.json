This can be both a blessing and a curse because the committees provide a framework and structure for conducting safety reviews recognizing that the time commitment may be onerous and academic departments may not reward participation on safety and health committees. In the long term though, the benefit of using an IBC to conduct health and safety reviews is a worthy initiative and serves to protect the institution, its employees, and students by managing risk. The physical damage to life and limb, inadvertent exposure to biological agents or toxins to persons or the environment and potential damage to reputation caused by laboratory and research program accidents should convince anyone who questions this expansion of IBC duties to pause and see the logic of supporting IBC safety reviews outside the boundaries of their traditional role.",

This may lead people working with these agents to believe that the agents have no hazards associated with them. However, many genetically modified study drugs are targeted against conditions with poor prognoses, so these potential therapeutics can have significant adverse side effects and still have a favorable risk\u2013benefit ratio for the trial participant. If the clinical trial is supported solely by private funding and is performed only at clinical care centers that receive no NIH funding (e.g., private cancer centers) then the clinical trial does not fall under the NIH Guidelines. This means that the trial does not need to undergo public discussion through submission to NIH\u2019s Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) or have local review by an IBC [8]. These trials would still be required to undergo Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review and local IRB review, but those bodies review different aspects than the RAC and IBC do. For example, the FDA and local IRB focus primarily on the safety of the recipients by ensuring the ethical conduct of the trial [9]. While the RAC and IBC also consider participant safety, they bring specific technical expertise needed for the assessment of the risks to close contacts of the recipient as well as the healthcare professionals preparing and administering the agent. Genetically modified viruses or other gene therapy agents may have the potential to modify the genetic code of the recipient\u2019s reproductive cells, making effective barrier contraception critical. Unlike traditional drugs which are metabolized and eventually broken down in the recipient\u2019s body, investigational agents created from microbes or modified human cells may be capable of replicating and expanding. This increases the opportunity for contamination of hospital rooms, personal bathrooms, or shared items such as eating utensils. Live agents, genetically modified or not, can pose risk of serious harm to individuals with immune deficiencies caused by organ transplant, infectious disease, pregnancy, or other conditions. Recipients of these agents must be instructed on how, and for how long, to minimize their contact with these high-risk individuals and how to properly clean and disinfect their homes to minimize the risk of transmission of potentially infectious study drug through bodily fluids. IBCs are responsible for reviewing the informed consent documents to verify that these instructions are adequately explained.",

In addition to the direct effects of the gene therapy product or virus itself, an accident that results in exposure to manufacturing-scale quantities may induce a strong enough immune response or allergic reaction to lead to serious illness or death.

At institutions where no IBC is present, no oversight body would be available to educate investigators on the possible safety and regulatory implications of mixing genes from select agent viruses with non-regulated viruses and potentially dangerous chimeric viruses may be inadvertently created. If investigators do not realize that these chimeric viruses are more pathogenic than the parent strain then they may not use the proper safety precautions or laboratory facilities.

This policy describes the requirements for local review, approval, and oversight of dual use research of concern (DURC). DURC is described in detail elsewhere in this book but, in short, DURC refers to research that produces valuable scientific information but may also be used in warfare or terror attacks. This federal policy requires that each institution designate an Institutional Review Entity (IRE) to review DURC projects and assist in creation of risk mitigation plans for these projects. The companion guide [14] that accompanies the federal policy suggests that IBCs are the most logical choice for the IRE since similar expertise is needed to assess the risks associated with recombinant DNA research and modifications of pathogens that may increase their transmissibility or pathogenicity. IBCs may not have the security expertise needed for these reviews, however, and consultants or ad hoc members may need to be added to fulfill the responsibilities assigned to the IRE. The DURC policy only applies to institutions that receive federal funding for life sciences research and is restricted to research involving 15 specific pathogens. Institutions or individuals that receive no federal funding are under no obligation to follow the DURC policy, nor are individuals who are working with pathogens other than the 15 specifically listed in the DURC policy. Many common human pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, E. coli, or influenza) are not on the list of pathogens covered by the DURC policy. Consequently, there is no regulatory reason why researchers cannot modify the pathogens to become more virulent. While this research would most likely be done to study the mechanisms that make pathogens more deadly and to better understand how to control natural infections with these pathogens, publication of this research may provide a roadmap for individuals who would use biological agents in terrorist attacks.",

            "text": "In October 2014, the White House announced a funding pause and voluntary moratorium on so-called \u201cgain-of-function\u201d research for three pathogens (influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) [15]. While gain-of-function (GOF) is not specifically defined in the White House memo, the general consensus is that GOF refers to any experiments that increase the pathogenicity or mammalian transmissibility of these pathogens. The White House memo also does not describe how GOF research should be identified or reviewed at institutions performing infectious disease research. Because GOF is similar to DURC, it seems most likely that institutions will ask their IREs to review GOF research in addition to DURC. This will increase the workload for IBCs which will now be tasked to make decisions about GOF research in the absence of clear guidance or policy statements from the federal government regarding what is, or isn\u2019t, GOF research. This funding pause is not yet a formal policy and it currently only applies to individuals receiving federal funding for these three specific agents so the number of researchers impacted is expected to be low.",

A properly functioning IBC will have the expertise needed to anticipate whether proposed research has the potential to increase the pathogenicity of an agent and recommend additional safeguards to protect the individual researchers and the surrounding community from an accidental exposure or release. The DURC policy and GOF funding pause provide more guidance on how and when IBCs need to formalize these types of reviews and recommendations. Institutions or individuals that receive no federal funding may not have access to the expertise needed to assess the risks associated with the modifications they are making to lower-risk pathogens and may end up creating potentially dangerous infectious agents.",

This role is ever-expanding and includes such diverse topics as facility design, collection of wild animals, production of engineered nanomaterials, and medical surveillance. Even with all that IBCs are asked to do, there are still several areas of research that receive no IBC review because the research falls outside of the existing regulations. These gaps create the possibility for potentially dangerous, if well-intentioned, research to continue without appropriate safety oversight. But, it is highly likely that any new mandates for oversight responsibility will fall to the IBC at most universities and research establishments.",
