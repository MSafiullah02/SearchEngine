Inspection of the mouth may reveal palatal clefts and whether they involve the hard or soft portions. The larynx should initially be examined for the presence of clefts and, in conjunction with dissection of the esophagus, tracheoesophageal fi stulas. After removal of the esophagus, the form of the tracheal rings should be checked for either complete rings or rings with large posterior pars membranacea that might accompany tracheomalacia. My preference when examining for laryngeal anomalies, especially when suggested by the history or presence of pulmonary hyperplasia (vide infra), is to cut the larynx transversely into three or four blocks for step or serial histological sectioning (Gould and Howard 1985) .",

Infl ating one of the lungs with formalin instilled through the airways can be valuable, particularly in assessing maturity. The precise diagnosis of lung pathology One of the most critical events of birth is the conversion of the fl uid-fi lled lung, unimportant to fetal intrauterine existence, into a hollow organ distended with air and capable of gaseous exchange suffi cient to support life. Indeed, it has been argued that the major determinant of perinatal survival is respiratory function (Wigglesworth and Desai 1982) .",

In the preterm infant, problems are mainly related to pulmonary immaturity and associated therapy. In the mature infant, birth asphyxia primarily results in cerebral damage but can engender signifi cant respiratory complications when associated with aspiration of meconium. Even in stillbirths, where primary pulmonary pathology is rarely a cause of death, lung pathology may provide clues to antecedent events. Poor lung growth and maturation may point to the presence of pathology elsewhere. Consequently, adequate pathological investigation of the fetal or infant respiratory system is critical in any perinatal autopsy. macroscopically is diffi cult and histology is mandatory, with at least one block from each main lobe.",

Caudally the mandibular processes fuse and the intervening space between mandibular and maxillary processes becomes the primitive mouth, or stomatodeum. On either side of the midline of the frontonasal process, thickening of the epithelium forms circular nasal disks or placodes, each of which recede from the surface due to a combination of active invagination and proliferation of surrounding mesenchyme. Eventually this burrowing activity forms the anterior nares (Ferguson 1991) . The newly developed nasobuccal membrane separating the nose from the mouth breaks down posteriorly at 7 weeks to form the communicating posterior choanal space. Anteriorly the bucconasal membrane ultimately remains as the primary palate, the remainder being replaced by the secondary or defi nitive palate derived from horizontal palatine processes. Fusion commences at the primary palate and extends rostrally. Normal palatal fusion is dependent on epithelial programmed cell death (Goldman 1992) at the point of fusion and mesenchymally signaled epithelial differentiation (Ferguson et al. 1992 ; Rice et al. 2004 ).",

The appearance and subsequent disappearance, during the transition from pseudoglandular to canalicular phase, of various laminins and integrin subunits in bronchial bud basement membranes imply a critical role at this stage of normal lung branching (Virtanen et al. 1996) .

Growth factors, especially fi broblast growth factor 10, are critical from a very early stage possibly operating via sonic hedgehog, a regulatory molecule present in many organs and found especially at epithelial tips (Shannon and Hyatt 2004) .

In vitro, this occurs rapidly (60 minutes), suggesting a posttranslational effect. Of interest, androgens appear to block FPF production, which might partly account for the increased risk of respiratory distress in male infants. Glucocorticoids may also stimulate the de novo synthesis of fatty acids, used by type 2 pneumocytes to produce surfactant (Rooney 1989) . In contrast, thyrotropin-releasing hormone with or without dexamethasone depresses the late gestation surge in antioxidants probably at the level of gene transcription rather than posttranscriptionally (Chen and Frank 1993) .",

Pulmonary epithelium actively secretes chloride ions into the duct lumen, and this passage of negative ions is accompanied by sodium and water (Olver and Strang 1974) . At birth, lung liquid secretion needs to cease, and that already present needs to be absorbed. Adrenaline, to which pulmonary epithelium becomes increasingly sensitive as term approaches, appears to control this latter aspect (Brown et al. 1983 ). Its action on chloride transport is unclear, but adrenaline may open sodium channels and stimulate active sodium transport from the alveolar lumen (Walters and Ramsden 1987) . Where there is a failure of this process, persistence of lung liquid may cause transient neonatal respiratory distress. Of greater importance to the pathologist is the evidence that indicates that the secretion of lung liquid and its gradual loss into the amniotic fl uid is vital to normal lung growth (Nicolini et al. 1989 ).",

Under normal circumstances, fetal lung is only exposed to low oxygen tensions, and consequently antioxidant enzyme levels are relatively low. In parallel with those of surfactant, antioxidant enzyme systems mature with gestation and reach a peak at term (Frank and Sosenko 1987) .

In the precapillary arteries, the changes may occur within minutes after birth. Associated changes that promote further pulmonary blood fl ow include ductal closure. In healthy infants, most blood fl ow alterations have occurred by 8 to 12 hours after birth.

This allows an increase in cardiac output through the pulmonary vasculature, but without a parallel rise in pulmonary vascular resistance.

It may be due to an intrinsic abnormality of the trachea or from extrinsic pressure. Intrinsic tracheal stenosis is either diffuse or segmental. Diffuse stenosis may result from a posterior fusion of the tracheal cartilages. In some cases the trachea is funnel shaped, and it gradually becomes more stenotic. Common associations include a sling left pulmonary artery or pulmonary agenesis. Diffuse stenosis may also be caused by a solid cartilaginous sleeve usually associated with craniosynostosis syndromes such as Apert's. It probably refl ects a generalized mesenchymal defect. The most frequent stenosis is a segmental, napkinring type with individual cartilages having a complete tracheal ring. More frequent than intrinsic tracheal stenosis, is extrinsic compression from a vascular ring encircling the trachea such as a double aortic arch, or an abnormal vessel such as an aberrant left pulmonary artery (Fig. 20.9 ). Many are associated with other abnormalities, notably of the cardiovascular system (Bonnard et al. 2003) .

They may present clinically as stridor or respiratory distress and diagnosis is made bronchoscopically by visualizing airway collapse, usually during expiration. As the problem can resolve spontaneously, and is more frequent in preterm infants, it has been attributed to \"immaturity\" of tracheal or bronchial cartilages (Cogbill et al. 1983 ), implying abnormally thin or fl oppy cartilage. A defi cit in the cartilaginous rings may be present (Gupta et al. 1968; Belmont and Grundfast 1984; Benjamin 1984) . Describing the normal cartilage to soft tissue ratio as 4.5 : 1, Benjamin states that the C-shaped cartilages in tracheomalacia are smaller and the ratio may fall to 2 : 1. The increase in the soft tissue posteriorly allows anteroposterior collapse of the airway. Familial malacia is reported (Agosti et al. 1974) , and an association with other congenital abnormalities, particularly congenital heart disease, is common. There does appear to be a signifi cant association between these tracheobronchial abnormalities and chromosomal anomalies such as trisomy 21 and 22q deletions (Maeda et al. 2000; Huang and Shapiro 2000; Betrand et al. 2003) .",

Complications and management are more dependent on the size and extent of the lesion and factors such as the degree of mediastinal shift than precise subtype (Davenport et al. 2004) . Increasing experience of antenatal detection indicates prognosis is not as bad as formerly thought, even in the presence of systemic complications. Pulmonary cysts may become less visible as gestation progresses and, by the time of birth, imaging may detect some lesions only with diffi culty. Some argue that abnormal lung should always be resected, as it will almost invariably become symptomatic at some point in life (Laberge et al. 2005) and have a higher risk of malignancy (Ueda et al. 1977; Domitzio et al. 1990; Ribvet et al. 1995; Kaslovsky et al. 1997; MacSweeney et al. 2003) . Others recommend postnatal follow-up with computed tomography (CT) scan for the fi rst year, and resection only if the abnormality persists on imaging or is symptomatic (Calvert 2005) . In this latter study 78% of infants diagnosed with cystic lung disease in utero required surgery in the their fi rst year. It is likely that many cystic lung lesions go undetected and regress, although adult presentation is recorded (Lackner et al. 1996) .",

While aspects of the pathogenesis remain incomplete, Langston (2003) places more emphasis on regarding some pulmonary cysts as part of a sequence that makes it easier for some lesions, which often have more than one pathology, to be more easily described and understood ( Fig. 20.11 ). Bronchial atresia may be a common factor in a number of types of pulmonary cystic disease (Riedlingen et al. 2006 ). Classifi cation is as follows:",

Mucus and macrophages, within the cysts and sur-rounding lung, suggesting airway obstruction, are common features of resected lung with small cyst disease. Very occasionally, striated muscle may be found randomly distributed throughout the malformation (Fig. 20 .14). Of the three main subtypes, this type is most commonly associated with malformation elsewhere, especially of the renal tract (Pham et al. 2004 ). \u2022 Solid adenomatoid malformation (Stocker type 3): This subtype is formed of small cysts less than 0.5 cm in diameter, involving an entire lobe. Cyst lining is cuboidal epithelium on a very thin fi bromuscular layer with no cartilage or mucigenic cells (Fig. 20.15 ). Due to the overall size of the affected lung, type 3 CCAM is more likely to produce signifi cant mediastinal shift and carry a poor prognosis. This form of abnormality may have parallels with pulmonary hyperplasia due to airway obstruction (Langston 2003) , and bronchial atresia has occasionally been demonstrated (Fig 20.10 ). \u2022 Peripheral cyst type (Stocker type 4) : Proposed in 1994 (Stocker 1994) , this type was considered a probable hamartomatous malformation of the distal acinus, often presenting as an asymptomatic incidental fi nding or sudden respiratory distress from spontaneous pneumothorax. It comprises large peripheral thin-walled cysts up to 7 cm in diameter lined by type 1 alveolar and cuboidal cells. The cyst walls are formed of thin loose mesenchyme often with thick-walled arteries. However, it is likely many of these cysts are cystic pleuropulmonary blastomas, and the distinction may be extremely diffi cult (Mac-Sweeney et al. 2003) . Indeed, because of the malignant potential of the latter, the diagnosis of a malformation should be made only with extreme caution (Hill et al. 2004; Miniati et al. 2006 ). \u2022 Acinar dysplasia (Stocker type 0): Initially reported as acinar dysplasia (Rutledge and Jensen 1986) , this type has been proposed as a type 0 adenomatoid malformation. Incompatible with life, the macroscopic appearance is of a severely hypoplastic lung (Chambers 1991) . It is described in association with cardiac anomalies and, in one case, renal anomalies (Gillespie et al. 2004) . Microscopically, acinar development is extremely poor with terminal sacs lined by pseudostratifi ed, bronchial-type columnar epithelium with goblet cells (Fig. 20.16 ).",

            "text": "Sequestered lobes are abnormal masses of pulmonary tissue that do not communicate with the main pulmonary bronchial tree and are supplied by an anomalous artery usually arising from the descending aorta. Sequestration may be intrapulmonary (intralobar sequestration, ILS), or extrapulmonary (extralobar sequestration, ELS), when the sequestered lobe is invested by its own pleura. Extralobar sequestration may present in the fetus with hydrops, as an incidental fi nding by ultrasound, or postmortem associated with other anomalies. In infancy it may present with respiratory distress. Extralobar sequestration may lie anywhere in the thorax or even subdiaphragmatically. In ELS, small cyst type adenomatoid malformation is commonly present. Intralobar sequestration is usually found within the left lower lobe. It has been suggested that, because ILS is rarely found in fetuses or neonates (Ng et al. 1994 ) and presentation is often late, only a few may be true malformations, and most are the result of infection (Stocker and Kagan-Hallet 1979) . However, it is clear that a number of cystic pulmonary lesions, initially seen in utero by ultrasound, when resected postnatally are found to be supplied by a systemic artery (Walford et al. 2003) and conform to the defi nition of a sequestration (Fig. 20.17A) (Langston 2003; Orpen et al. 2003) . In resected lung, small cysts are sometimes macroscopically visible in the resected specimen, but in others the adenomatoid component is only apparent histologically (Fig. 20.17B) ; mucus retention may be striking. The intervening lung parenchyma may also be abnormal; elastin stains may be very helpful in defi ning the extent of the abnormality (Fig. 20.17C ). Clements and Warner (1987) emphasize that a wide range of bronchial connection, arterial supply, and venous drainage may be found. The embryological origin of pulmonary sequestration is a matter of debate, although there does appear to be a consensus that other bronchopulmonary abnormalities may be related (Heithoff et al. 1976; Landing and Dixon 1979; Clements and Warner 1987) .",

Reduction in thoracic volume can be caused by poor rib growth, for example, skeletal dysplasias; a spaceoccupying lesion, for example, an abnormal viscus associated with diaphragmatic hernia (Areechon and Reid 1963) ; eventration (Fig. 20.22 ); or pleural effusion associated with hydrops. With hernias and eventration, the hypoplasia is typically unilateral. \u2022 Fetal breathing: In utero, the fetus normally makes bursts of rapid but low-amplitude breathing movements, primarily diaphragmatic in origin. It is not entirely clear how or why such movements should be important to lung growth, but that they are is strongly suggested by lung hypoplasia in conditions associated with their absence, or by experimental work in which the effects of fetal breathing are negated (Liggins et al. 1981 ). It has been suggested that these movements allow infl ux of amniotic fl uid or generate important pressure changes within the thorax (Wigglesworth 1987a; Kitterman 1984) . The interrelationship among normal fetal breathing movements, lung liquid, and lung growth has been summarized (Hooper and Harding 1995) . Pulmonary hypoplasia may also be seen when fetal breathing has been inhibited by severe brainstem injury (Endo et al. 2001) or other cerebral pathology (Matturri et al. 2003 ). \u2022 Oligohydramnios: Oligohydramnios due to either insuffi cient production or excessive loss of fl uid (Hislop et al. 1979; Nimrod et al. 1984) , is probably the commonest recognized single cause of lung hypoplasia. In the presence of premature membrane rupture, pulmonary hypoplasia is one of the main determinants of survival, especially in the very premature (Robson et al. 1993; Lauria et al. 1995) . The mechanism is unclear. In oligohydramnios, a larger than normal pressure gradient between fetal lung and amniotic sac occurs and the effl ux of fetal lung liquid may be too rapid (Nicolini et al. 1989; Harding et al. 1990; Kizilcan et al. 1995) . Lung liquid, retained within fetal airways and developing respiratory units, might act as a \"stent\" around which alveoli form. Another factor may be increased spinal fl exion from uterine compression (Albuquerque et al. 2002) . These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive.",

The laryngeal anomaly prevents the loss of fetal lung liquid Silver et al. 1988 ). However, attempts to reproduce this experimentally by plugging the trachea give mixed results. While lungs are larger, lung maturation remains impaired (Piedboeuf et al. 1997; Nardo et al. 1998; Chapin et al. 2005) . In human fetuses, there are also indications that tracheal occlusion does not enhance maturation, but the increase in lung size is due mainly to emphysema and mucus pooling (Heerema et al. 2003) .",

For the pathologist, they are the most outward expression of a complex pathophysiological process. The acute transudation from capillaries adjacent to the terminal airways refl ects damage to epithelium and endothelium, whose integrity is necessary to form an impermeable barrier between the vasculature and the airways. What produces the damage is not entirely clear. It is presumed that either in the infant's attempts to breathe or because of the positive pressure from the ventilator, the terminal airways expand and shear forces damage the lining epithelium (Robertson 1991) . The toxic effect of oxygen might also contribute, or the epithelial damage may refl ect a \"refl ow\" injury following a period of local ischaemia. That ischemia may be contributory in some instances is suggested by evidence of increased pulmonary intravascular coagulation (Schmidt et al. 1992) . The very terminal parts of the respiratory units, that is, the air sacs, fail to expand because surface tension, which acts to collapse these small \"spheres,\" is too great to overcome in the absence of surfactant. FIGURE 20.24. Hyaline membrane disease in a 26-week-gestation neonate dying at 12 hours of age. Necrotic respiratory bronchiolar epithelium lines part of a dilated airway. Hyaline membrane is also present at this level and more distally. In the most distal part of the lung, the air sacs adjacent to the pleura are collapsed but do not contain membrane. Surfactant replacement therapy is now recommended for any infant less than 27 to 28 weeks' gestation while slightly more mature infants receive surfactant if their RDS is severe enough to require intubation (Halliday 2003) . Its use has seen a major reduction in morbidity and perinatal mortality of up to 65% with no signifi cant complications except perhaps a slight increase in pulmonary hemorrhage, mainly with some artifi cial replacement surfactants (Halliday 2003) . Where infants do die with respiratory distress syndrome, no major difference in the lung pathology between babies who have or who have not had surfactant replacement is described (Pinar et al. 1994; Thornton et al. 1994) , although in my experience the membranes tend to be more scant and fragmented than in the natural disease.",

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was described by Northway et al.

This damage usually occurred in the fi rst few days of life during treatment of an acute lung disease, most commonly the surfactant-defi cient hyaline membrane disease of preterm infants. Infants with BPD required intensive ventilatory support and had lungs that showed a spectrum of damage but that commonly included obliterated airways and an interstitial fi brosis. The infants commonly died from respiratory failure or complications directly attributable to fi brotic lungs such as cor pulmonale. With better management and advent of therapies such as surfactant replacement, this pattern of severe lung disease has largely disappeared, but a milder condition has emerged in which continued respiratory support is still required but at a much diminished level. In many cases, the early acute lung disease is relatively mild and there may be an interval between the apparent successful treatment of the acute disease and the onset of a chronic respiratory disease process.",

The damage is predominantly due to interference with normal alveolarization so that there are fewer, but larger and simpler, air spaces, leading to a signifi cant decrease in surface area and a reduced abnormal pulmonary microvasculature (Jobe and Bancalari 2001; Thibeault et al. 2004; Galambos and DeMello 2007) . Histologically these changes can be relatively subtle, and the relative increase in alveolar size easily missed by the casual observer. There is evidence that interference with the normal processes of septation and alveolarization occurs very early, and the normal collagen framework is affected by ventilation (Thibeault et al. 2003) .",

It varies markedly depending on gestation and because the pattern of disease and defi nition of BPD has changed. However, there is some indication that the need for longterm ventilatory support is increasing, possibly because of averted neonatal death from improving therapies (Yu and Ng 1995) . Approximately, 20% of very low birth weight babies (<1500 g) still require some supplementary oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (Sosenko et al. 2003) . Clinically, the infants destined to develop BPD are not easy to identify at an early stage, although antenatal factors may be signifi cant. These include early, prenatal lung infl ammation (Watterberg et al. 1994; Matsuda et al. 1997) . Bronchoalveolar lavage studies indicate a higher level of infl ammatory and oxidant markers associated with the acute lung injury in those infants who progress to chronic lung disease (Contreras et al. 1996; Murch et al. 1996b ) compared with those who do not. Additional factors may include the use, too early, of intralipid during parenteral nutrition, which may interfere with oxygenation (Cooke 1991; Stahl et al. 1992) ; lung colonization with Ureaplasma urealyticum (Wang et al. 1995) ; and antenatal steroids (Jobe 2003) .",

In the lung, there are probably two main sources of toxic radicals: neutrophils or macrophages as a product of infl ammation, and as a by-product of normal pulmonary epithelial or endothelial metabolism. Tissue production of free radicals is enhanced in the presence of high oxygen concentrations and damage is accentuated in the absence of normal cellular antioxidant defenses. The precise mechanism by which tissue damage leads to interstitial fi brosis is unclear, but it may cause an increase in capillary permeability, and fl uid leakage with subsequent organization. Platelet-derived growth factor may be produced by the interstitium in response to hyperoxia and stimulate early fi broblast hyperplasia (Han et al. 1992 ). Inactivation of surfactant may also be important (Merritt 1982; Saugstad 1990; Contreras et al. 1996) .
