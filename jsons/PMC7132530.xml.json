For example, the impact of the bubonic and pneumonic plague or \u201cBlack Death\u201d had a major influence on painters of the Gothic Period [1]; tuberculosis is featured in Eugene G. O\u2019Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night; Franz Kafka's Diaries; Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain\n[2]; Victor Hugo's Les Mis\u00e9rables; Dickens\u2019 Nicholas Nickleby, Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights; Verdi's La Traviata\n[3]. Among epidemics in the past three decades (HIV/AIDS, SARS, mad cow disease, and avian flu among others), only HIV/AIDS has lasted long enough to inspire artistic expressions in literature [4], [5], [6], [7], theatre [8], dance [9], and film [10] mostly used as vehicles for HIV/AIDS preventive education programs particularly in Africa [8], [9], [10], [11], [12].",

Ever since, a community of experts worldwide has been dedicated to prevention [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. However, despite the struggle to convey a more accurate and humane public image of AIDS in the past decade, the stigma attached to HIV/AIDS still persists as a formidable obstacle to prevention efforts [21], [22], [23]. Figures on the spread of the disease suggest we are losing the battle against HIV/AIDS especially in developing countries [3], [24], [25], [26], [27]. In China alone, the estimated number of deaths due to AIDS as of December 2003 (latest figures available), ranged from 21,000 to 75,000 and 840,000 persons infected with HIV/AIDS. The figures for Thailand, the second most affected East Asian country, are 34,000\u201397,000 deaths, and 570,000 persons infected with HIV (Appendix A, Table A.1).",

            "text": "In contrast to the dismal HIV/AIDS situation, the 2002\u20132003 outbreak of severe asymptomatic respiratory syndrome or SARS, offers a completely different picture for the analysis of preventive efforts. Although SARS, like HIV/AIDS, was unknown in the medical world and hit unexpectedly, there are some significant differences, particularly in their etiology, epidemiology, natural history and clinical outcomes of the two diseases. HIV/AIDS is asymptomatic for 7\u201310 years after infection so that HIV-positive persons may continue to spread the disease unknowingly. The main mode of HIV/AIDS transmission is through direct contact with infected body fluids or blood (sexual intercourse, use of infected needles by drug users and receiving contaminated blood transfusions). SARS is caused by the SARS coronavirus and characterized by airborne transmission. SARS develops very rapidly, with an average incubation period of 5 days or a range of 2\u201310 days after contact. Within 1 week of the illness patients show typical influenza-like symptoms such as fever, malaise, and headache with cough and diarrhoea getting worst in the second week of infection. It has been determined that \u201ctransmission occurs mainly during the second week of illness\u201d. These external signs facilitate prompt action: exposed patients may be placed under fever surveillance twice a day \u201cin an isolation facility or ward for at least 10 days after the last exposure to the source case(s)\u201d [28]. In the span of 9 months SARS infected 8096 persons, caused 774 deaths (Appendix A, Table A.2) and became a widespread visible threat through the serious disruption of normal daily activities of individuals and major sectors of the economy such as transportation, commerce, industrial production, and tourism [28], [29], [30]. The first probable SARS case was reported in China on 16 November 2002 and the infection spread to 28 other countries around the world but the largest number of locally transmitted infections and deaths were reported in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, and Singapore (Appendix A, Table A.2). Despite the fact that SARS caught the world unprepared, hit at great speed, and it is very difficult to eradicate [31], the outbreak was contained within 9 months, a relatively brief period of time (Appendix A, Table A.2).",

Social science research has identified over the past decades a complex array of factors and conditions associated with disease prevention in individuals (micro-level analysis) as well as collectivities (macro-level analysis) but the factors and conditions vary for different diseases and there may be many other factors yet to be identified. Still, contrasting the two epidemics in terms of social attitudes and beliefs at the micro-and macro-levels, will help us to elucidate some of the major obstacles to HIV/AIDS prevention. Therefore, this paper focuses on only three possible factors: the impact of perceived severity and susceptibility to infection and the public image of the epidemic (micro-level factors); and the governance of epidemics (macro-level factor).",

Among ten theories identified as the \u201cmost often used\u201d today [34], the top two explanatory models are the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and the Health Belief Model (HBM) [34], [35]. Both social theories are useful in the analysis of preventive action: they focus on the individual's capacity to make his/her own decisions, and the recognition that there are multiple and varied factors involved in a person's health-related actions. The SCT explains people's health-related actions primarily in terms of their expectations of the outcome, their confidence in the success of their actions, and their ability to perform the action; but perhaps the most relevant aspect of the SCT is its consideration of the individual's environment as one of the important determinants of his/her behavior [36].",

A comprehensive review of studies applying the HBM [37] found the variables perceived susceptibility and perceived severity to be closely correlated and to have significant influence upon a variety of preventive behaviors. The combination of both perceived severity and perceived susceptibility labeled \u201cperceived threat\u201d has been found to be a more significant explanatory variable than severity and susceptibility used separately [37]. The HBM variable influencing the perception of effective prevention of HIV/AIDS in three ethnic communities is perceived severity or seriousness of the disease, together with the perception of personal responsibility for contracting the disease [39]. I ascertained perceived severity of HIV/AIDS in terms of the respondents\u2019 subjective perception of the likelihood of death using the close-ended question \u201cWhen you think about AIDS, how serious do you feel it is? This approach is basically the same as that of Janz et al. [38] who define perceived severity as \u201cOne's belief of how serious a condition and its sequelae are\u201d. Strecher et al. had offered earlier [37] a wider definition of perceived severity: \u201cpersonal evaluations of the probable biomedical, financial and social consequences of contracting HIV and having AIDS\u201d. Although there are slight variations in the wording of the question asked in interviews and in the definition of perceived severity, the general consensus in the literature is that this conceptual construct, often together with perceived susceptibility, is essential in the analysis of people's motivation to take preventive action. Nevertheless, as preventive health behavior is influenced by a multiplicity of factors, the HBM, SCT and all the other top eight theories [34] are limited as they offer only partial explanations of health-related behavior, but they are complementary.",

Thus, my assumption that a person's motivation to take preventive action may also be manifested in his or her cooperation with community-based preventive measures is explained clearly by the application of the conceptual premises on community responses to stressor events formulated by Reiss and Oliveri [43]. The public's perception of the scope of the problem was highlighted by these authors as part of their concept \u201ccommunity's punctuation of an event\u201d. They defined the community's punctuation of an event or perceived scope as \u201cwhen the problem begins and when it ends and who is involved\u201d. They proposed that the community and its leaders would be more inclined to invest concerted efforts to solve a problem if three conditions are met: accountability, duty, and competence [43]. That is, the community and its policy-makers would be most inclined to mobilize assistance and preventive efforts when these three conditions are met: the persons affected are perceived as not being accountable for the problem; they are regarded as having the duty to request outside help; they are considered as lacking the competence to solve by themselves the problem affecting them. I suggest that these three conditions shape the public image of SARS and HIV/AIDS and add to our understanding of the disparity in prevention effectiveness of these two epidemics at the community level.",

The SARS study was conducted as the outbreak progressed in May 2003, 10 years after the HIV/AIDS study. Nonetheless, despite these methodological difficulties, I believe it is important to scrutinize available information on both epidemics in the hope of increasing our understanding of the dynamics of preventive action against HIV/AIDS. While the two epidemics are different in many respects, they are both serious public health threats that require a collective response [26], [30] as indicated earlier.",

The punctuation of the SARS outbreak as a crisis was very clear. SARS was imported into Singapore at the end of February, 2003, when an infected vacationer returned home from Hong Kong where she caught the infection while staying at the same Hong Kong hotel where a doctor from Guangzhou, China who had treated SARS patients there, was residing [50]. The unknown cause and nature of the disease deterred the assignment of blame or accountability. SARS patients were not held accountable for their illness. Nor were they assumed to have the expertise to solve the problem on their own although it soon became a duty for people with the publicized symptoms to seek immediate expert medical help [29], [51]. The findings from the SARS study in Table 2 show that 75.9% of the respondents made a positive appraisal of the health authorities\u2019 management and control of the SARS crisis; 77.4% had the chance to express their opinions to the authorities; 91.3% were prepared to be quarantined for 10 days after close contact with an infected person and 71.6% would agree to be quarantined even if there was non-close contact. Further indications of the public's willingness to collaborate in preventive efforts against SARS were the very positive attitudes of the majority of respondents: although about one of every two agreed that preventive measures taken against SARS \u201chave affected my personal choice and freedom in life\u201d, most respondents (95.3%) agreed that \u201cpeople should be willing to make some personal sacrifices\u201d to contain the epidemic and 86% felt that \u201cpeople have mostly been socially responsible\u201d.",

Among the 1202 respondents, the endorsement of the health authorities\u2019 crisis management was particularly supported by people who perceived the community as being socially responsible; those who believed that the crisis justified making some personal sacrifices (especially with regard to movement outside their homes, restricting or changing their travel patterns, and abiding by quarantine regulations); those felt that they had the chance to be part of the effort and express their personal opinions; people who had formed an opinion on their personal susceptibility to the infection (in contrast to those who had no or very little information on SARS). The Nagelkerke R\n2 coefficient of 0.139 suggests the factors in the model explain 13.9% of the variation in endorsement of the crisis management in the total population. The analysis of the same factors was repeated among three specific subgroups that have shown less positive appraisal of crisis management: the senior cohort (respondents aged 60 and older), the lower educated (people with only primary or lower education), and Malays. As illustrated in Table 3, even among the lower educated and the Malay, the sense of social responsibility was significantly associated with their endorsement of preventive efforts (dependent variable). However, perceived susceptibility to SARS did not influence significantly the appraisal of crisis management by the seniors and the less educated but it did among Malays in the expected direction: persons who have no idea of their susceptibility (no awareness of it) were most likely to give a negative appraisal of crisis management. No significant impact of perceived severity upon people's appraisal of crisis management was detected in the total sample or any of the three subgroups. Overall, the Nagelkerke R\n2 coefficients indicate that, compared to the total sample, variables in the model helped explain a larger proportion of the variance in the dependent variable among subgroups such as seniors (43.7%), the less educated (33.8%) and the Malay community (29.0%) about 80% of the time. These figures point to the importance of variations the perception of and responses to crises among different segments of the population given their differences in life experiences, in knowledge and level of information on the problem, and in cultural values and beliefs, among other factors.",

Visible signs of the disease tend to appear only in the late stages. The opposite occurred with respect to SARS. Two separate studies of the awareness of health threats in the United Kingdom confirm these findings on impact of the public image of the problem and punctuation or scope of the event: British lay respondents and journalists were inclined to see AIDS as a \u201cfar-flung\u201d risk of no immediate relevance to their lives [62], [63].",

The odds of seeing them as \u2018victims\u2019 (column b) were significantly higher among older people, those who do not think HIV/AIDS is a serious and deadly disease; and those who do not believe there is an effective way of preventing the illness. Interestingly, the same features are exhibited by the small group who did not put a label on people living with HIV/AIDS (column a): they tend to be older, unaware of the severity of the disease, and unaware of any effective preventive measures. The odds of perceiving HIV/AIDS sufferers as \u2018risk-takers\u2019 that is, associating a \u2018risk-taking\u2019 life style with HIV/AIDS infection (column c), decreased by 45% among men; increased significantly among people who worry about falling ill and those who believe that there are effective ways of preventing the disease. The most negative \u2018image\u2019 or lifestyle associated with HIV/AIDS infection is that labeled \u2018deviants\u2019 (column d). The odds of having this image of HIV/AIDS sufferers increase significantly among women in contrast to men; among younger people in contrast to people who are 60 or older; among those believe the disease is very severe, and among people who do not worry much about falling ill. The Nagelkerke R\n2 coefficients indicate that the variables in the model explain 45.6% of the overall variation in emphasis on the \u2018victim\u2019 image; 19.5% of the emphasis on the \u2018risk-takers\u2019 image; 16.9% of the emphasis on the \u2018deviant\u2019 image, and 58.1% of the variance on the absence of a stereotypical image of HIV/AIDS sufferers. This variable is explained correctly by the variables in the model 92.7% of the time (Table 4). These findings fit the international pattern: the presence of stereotypical images of people who get infected with HIV/AIDS is not restricted to a particular country [23], [61].",

It was believed that an informed public can collaborate better and participate more effectively in containing the spread of the disease than a public kept ignorant of the seriousness of the situation. News reports on the progress of the epidemic were transmitted to the public through all printed media, radio and television in all the four official languages (Mandarin, Malay, Tamil and English). Exceptional measures were taken to reach as many people as possible throughout Singapore: broadcasting was resumed temporarily in some of the Chinese dialects that had not been used in TV for nearly two decades; a new dedicated TV channel was set up, SARSTV. Singapore was the only country affected by SARS to set up this public service [56]. Informing the public on the development of the epidemic went hand-in-hand with public health education whereby public information on the current state of knowledge on the disease was constantly updated at various levels of sophistication, from medical and epidemiological data in specialized publications [57], [58] to newspaper articles explaining how the coronavirus attacks a healthy cell, to cartoons illustrating the proper use of masks, of serving utensils, and to take one's temperature correctly with a thermometer, and how to wash hands thoroughly, among other things.",

Fidler [30] correctly highlights \u201cthe conceptual and policy shifts\u201d from standard procedures applied to infectious diseases by the WHO and public health experts. The International Health Regulations (IHR) \u201care the only set of international legal rules binding on WHO member states concerning the control of infectious diseases\u201d [30]. Yet, in Fidler's view, one distinguishing feature of the official international approach to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic was that public health experts and the WHO did not follow the IHR's classical \u201cWestphalian\u201d model \u2013 that emphasizes state sovereignty and non-intervention \u2013 to deal with infectious diseases \u201cbut rather turned to international human rights law to provide governance norms for the fight against this new plague\u201d [30]. This conceptual shift was unique. The approach to HIV/AIDS was \u201cthe first time in history [that] preventing discrimination towards those affected by an epidemic became an integral part of a global strategy to prevent and control an epidemic of infectious disease\u201d [59], [30]. Danziger [26] suggests that this conceptual shift was promoted and supported by the \u201cneoliberal democratic ideology\u201d prevalent in Western countries by the end of the 20th century and enthusiastic enough to lead some countries to abandon the compulsory surveillance methods and \u201cplacing protection of individual rights on a par with (or even above) the protection of the public health\u201d.",

In June and July, 1981, five young homosexual men were diagnosed with pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and 26 young homosexual men with Kaposi's sarcoma \u201ca rare form of cancer which had until then been associated with elderly Americans\u201d; added to the spectrum of AIDS features in the early 1980s was the confirmation that one of the main forms of transmission is sexual intercourse [26]. The spread of the epidemic has been so extensive geographically as well as socially, that people living with HIV/AIDS today come from all walks of life. But as the figures in Appendix A, Table A.1 indicate, the highest prevalence of HIV are still found among some distinct lifestyle groups including commercial sex workers and injecting drug users. The survey data discussed in the preceding sections suggest that the public image of HIV/AIDS reflects the prevalence figures among some specific groups; a large majority of respondents saw HIV/AIDS sufferers as following their lifestyle by personal choice. Thus, their image remains negative despite public education efforts by the WHO, non-state organizations and non-governmental organizations. An additional aspect is the slow pace of development of the disease: people may be infected for many years without developing any symptoms and may thus continue unwittingly to infect others [26].",

            "text": "The global governance approach to protect people with HIV/AIDS from discrimination involves avoidance of disclosure of one's health condition and of routinely or compulsory name-linked testing and other features of standard infectious disease surveillance. Danziger [26] sees this position as \u201cpossessive individualism\u201d that demands testing to be done only if the person has consented freely and has received full information on the consequences through the process of informed consent. Moreover, Danziger points out that with the current stage of knowledge on HIV/AIDS, \u201cthere is little or no gain for a HIV-infected person to be tested and identified as HIV-positive\u201d [26]. This reasoning creates a dilemma because experts agree that standard infectious disease surveillance is indispensable for the effective prevention and control of infectious diseases [3], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [30], [52] that is, the beneficiaries of effective control and prevention are the rest of the community. According to Danziger [26] the dilemma has been sorted out internationally by an apparent consensus of stakeholders to consider HIV/AIDS as \u201ca crisis of human rights\u201d and not as a \u201cpublic health crisis\u201d. However, with the epidemic proceeding unrelentingly, there are signs of concern. A recent development in Singapore is illustrative of the range of opinions on this matter: The Ministry of Health announced on 15 July 2005 that \u201cspouses of patients with HIV will be informed of their partner's illness, regardless of whether the infected person agrees\u201d [60]. The newspaper report cited the case of four women who discovered they had HIV when they did their blood test during their pregnancies. The husband of one of them had been diagnosed with HIV since 2001. Previously, patients were counseled and informed consent was required. Now the doctor needs only to keep the patient \u201cappropriately informed\u201d. The spouses will be informed \u201cin a sensitive manner\u201d by trained personnel of a new HIV Prevention Unit. The Infectious Diseases Act will be invoked as is the case with all other infectious diseases [60]. The Singapore shift towards a version closer to standard surveillance of HIV/AIDS is indicative of its concern for the rights of the infected person as well as the rights of the patient's partner, and of all other persons involved. The global governance of HIV/AIDS prevention needs to address the public image of the disease and the impact that such an image has upon efforts to mobilize the community in prevention efforts. For as long as HIV/AIDS is seen as a problem of particular lifestyles (that is, of specific types of people), prevention efforts such as condom use and testing are bound to have limited impact.",

The data from the Singapore study support that assumption partially and revealed a new aspect of the problem. Perceived susceptibility was high for SARS but relatively low for HIV/AIDS. The opposite was found for perceived severity. The findings suggest that among the complex set of factors that motivate people to take preventive measures, perceived susceptibility to the disease (your subjective assessment of the likelihood of becoming infected) is more relevant than perceived severity of the disease. The data show a strong tendency for people to consider HIV/AIDS as peculiar to certain types of people different from themselves. Thus their belief that their chances of being infected with the HIV virus are remote is not surprising. These findings on low perceived susceptibility and high perceived severity are also meaningful in the context of the second assumption tested.",

The findings verify and clarify these assumptions. Only 3 out of every 10 respondents expressed high perceived susceptibility to HIV/AIDS compared to 8 out of every 10 in the case of SARS. But, as mentioned above, it was also found that the perceived severity of HIV/AIDS was significantly higher than the perceived severity of SARS. More importantly, the labeling of people living with HIV/AIDS as \u2018risk-takers\u2019 or \u2018deviants\u2019, was expressed by nine out of every 10 of the respondents who believed HIV/AIDS was a incurable disease (high perceived severity) and believed that the disease is mostly linked to one's lifestyle choice.

I have discussed the elements involved including the community's punctuation of the crisis and the aspects of accountability, duty, and competence. In the case of epidemics, competence is typically found at the community level and this brings us to the question of governance: how does a government deal with the health crisis represented by an infectious disease epidemic? Much has been learned over the centuries around the world but each new epidemic brings new dangers. The SARS outbreak tested the state's level of emergency preparedness and commitment to transparency particularly in Asian countries, but it also highlighted the need for global governance of health threats that cut across national boundaries. In contrast, the HIV/AIDS epidemic still represents a challenge in terms of public health, political ideology, human rights, and social discrimination. The lack of success in the control and prevention of the epidemic highlights the fact that after nearly three decades the global governance of HIV/AIDS is still a work-in-progress. The urgency of the problem is well recognized by most world leaders and specialists with some experts warning that \u201cnew threats to [world] stability and security may emerge as the pandemic escalates\u201d because, among other reasons, large numbers among police and armed forces in many countries and UN peacekeeping forces are getting infected [27]. The current global governance of HIV/AIDS requires critical scrutiny, as well as active exploration of solutions \u2013 among all types of stakeholders with differing ideological and social perspectives \u2013 to the slackness of preventive efforts against the two main behaviors that are sustaining the epidemic: \u201chigh-risk sexual activity and drug use\u201d [27]. One aspect of that critical scrutiny is the systematic and comparative analysis of HIV/AIDS global governance with the global governance of other infectious disease epidemics that have been successful. In sum, the findings on the SARS and HIV/AIDS experiences suggest that health authorities need to navigate effectively the local and global obstacles to prevention by: (a) enhancing the public's understanding of the etiology of HIV/AIDS, its modes of transmission and effective preventive measures; and (b) correcting the lay public's inaccurate perception of personal susceptibility and \u2018the punctuation of the event\u2019.",
