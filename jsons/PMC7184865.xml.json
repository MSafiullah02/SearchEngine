            "text": "Students however do not simply have to focus on existing leaders. Rather, they can create fictional leaders, alternate universes, or post-apocalyptic stories to convey these meanings. If students do create fictional leaders, it may make sense to have these leaders parallel real-life leaders. So, a Robespierre-like figure may command a region or nation in a post-apocalyptic world (Jessica Abel recounts how she created a story which combined the ideas of Euripides and space travel!). The fictional leader, based on reality, can give the student room to explore themes and not have to worry about being historically accurate. Further, if students do create a fictional leader and have more room for creativity, the notion of a story arc may be incorporated. Abel and Madden (2008) and Potts (2013) talk about the importance of the story or narrative arc for comics (and good writing in general). A story arc is some type of event or situation which disrupts that normal situation of the protagonist. A number of occurrences between the protagonists and antagonists then take place. Finally, there is the climax and a resolution (Abel & Madden, 2008, 127; Potts, 2013, 100). Teachers will most likely have to discuss the notion of a story arc, as well as protagonists and antagonists, with their students.",

In this activity, students must pretend to be an advisor to a leader and apply those ideas. Teachers can decide which leader this will be. Teachers could have students find a current event, identify a world leader who must make a controversial or tough decision, and pretend to be their Buddhist counsel. Or teachers could have students select a leader from history and have students give them Buddhist counsel. How would a Buddhist counsel Abraham Lincoln? Barack Obama?

Each student would have to create a frame or frames to showcase their ideas. The same rules would apply here. The students would have to cite placards and park rangers to build their comic. Finally, the students would come together and find the most optimal way to combine their comics. There are endless variations of this exercise as well as various options for the teacher to consider. How many students should be in a group? How much information should the teacher assign? Should the teacher assign leaders or let students pick? How many frames should students draw?

Further, the above assignments focused on a specific event, the American Civil War, where the activity below takes a broader approach. I used my nine-year-old daughter as a test subject for this assignment. While this book is written mainly for high school and college students, my daughter was able to provide important feedback on the assignment\u2014if she understood it, then a high schooler surely would be able to as well (Fig. 5.1). My daughter and I visited the home of James Buchanan, the 15th President of the United States. His home is located in Lancaster Pennsylvania. He served one term from 1857 to 1861. Marino and Crocco (2012) noted how the town of New Brunswick, New Jersey, which they chose to study as local history, is not as recognizable as other more well-known places. Yet, a great deal of history happened there. Similarly, Buchanan is not as recognizable as let\u2019s say Abraham Lincoln, but this I think made the assignment more interesting in some ways. Students presumably know more about famous presidents and leaders. But what about everyone else? What about mediocre or average leaders? These people had a role in events as well and it makes sense to study them. In fact, many of these mediocre or average leaders had a big hand in events, as did Buchanan (for better or for worse and with Buchanan, most agree it was for the worst). Teachers might do well to seek out interesting local leaders or people who are not as well-known and have students study their actions to show students that history is not simply the province of a few famous people.\n",

Nevertheless, I still think students can skillfully utilize imagery even in shorter comics, they just might have to work a little harder. In addition, as noted in Chapter 10.1007/978-3-030-44252-1_3, symbolism in comics can be in word, image, or story (Langley, 2018). Again, due to length, it might be easier for students to utilize visuals and words over stories to communicate symbolism but I think there is a place for story symbolism, at least for students who may want a challenge.",

What are the advantages and disadvantages to the use of symbols to convey legal ideas?Can you manipulate any existing symbols to convey a message about any of the cases we have read? (So, use Ross and Darnell as a guide. Can you think of ways to reinterpret Uncle Sam, Lady Justice, or even Smokey the Bear or other American symbols to convey an idea about the cases you were assigned to read?). Note: this does not have to be drawn, it can be written.Read the excerpt on sequences metaphors distributed in class. Also go to https://whynotsuperheroes.com/tag/understanding-comics/. This is a blog by a comics theorist, Chris Evans. DO NOT read the whole thing. Simply hit Control F which will bring up a search box. Search the term \u201c Sequence Metaphor.\u201d Read the brief section on sequence metaphors. (There is also a nice visual component to this.)Create a sequence metaphor drawing on the cases we have read. Consult my example for inspiration, which is posted in Joule. THIS COMIC SHOULD BE AT LEAST 2 PANELS (like my example).

This may have been somewhat redundant since we had already done something similar on the discussion board, but I wanted to have a comment session in both modalities, online and face to face. I think both modalities generated an interesting conversation. In the face-to-face setting, students were able to ask spontaneous questions and learn even more about their classmate\u2019s use of symbols. One student remarked how illustrating cases also helped her remember the cases. To be sure, not everyone loved the drawing component, but all the students did a great job and were able to articulate their use of symbols clearly. A student example is featured in Fig. 5.2.

Draw the initial symbol and then draw the constellation of forces it represents above it.Now, do the same thing as you did in question number one, but think of a legal symbol. Some examples could be: US President, America, or The Constitution. Try to incorporate some of the ideas we have discussed in class (e.g., amendments, different court cases, etc.).Now, make it sequential! Take your political symbol and build a short comic (at least two frames) with it.Explain why you chose to depict the constellation of forces in this way.Comment on one classmate\u2019s comic.

My comic focused on the symbol of the US president. In the left panel, I drew what I felt were two inept US presidents William G. Harding and James Buchanan. In the middle panel, I drew two presidents, who are usually considered some of the most effective (but of course this is debatable). Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Behind each president is a symbol of what made their presidency awful or great for me. For example, behind Buchanan I drew a picture of the United States breaking in half. The final panel simply pictures the presidential seal. I have tried to visualize the constellation of forces that the symbol of \u201cUS president\u201d may stand for.",

You can choose one of these ideas. However, if you want to do a combination of these or something of your own choosing, I strongly encourage that! Before you draw, you must first write a thematic statement (Potts, 2013, 105) which briefly outlines the \u201cunifying theme\u201d of the story, to give you some direction. Or, more appropriately for this project, you must write a \u201cdream statement.\u201d The dream statement is a succinct statement of the dream you will create in comic form. Remember, this is a dream of a better world that inspires people to act or some type of criticism to get people thinking.You can illustrate a scene from the history of education (e.g., the creation of Mount Holyoke, a typical day Sunday School, etc., Thaddeus Stevens speaking to the Pennsylvania assembly). If you choose this option, be sure to add your own elements to the scene. How can you use this scene to challenge an injustice?You can illustrate a fictional scene for a real person (Susan B. Anthony teaching fellow suffragettes, Thaddeus Stevens arguing with a racist person).You can illustrate a scene of historical fiction.You can conceive of a futuristic or even post-apocalyptic situation to illustrate (e.g., the downfall of the United States).\n",
