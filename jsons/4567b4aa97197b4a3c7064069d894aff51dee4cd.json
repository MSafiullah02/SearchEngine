The full repertoire of cellular targets and processes leading to the toxicity of aminoglycosides is not fully resolved, making it challenging to devise rational directions to circumvent their adverse effects. As a result, there has been very limited effort to rationally address the issue of aminoglycoside-induced toxicity. Here we provide an overview of the reported effects of aminoglycosides on cells of the inner ear and on kidney tubular epithelial cells. We describe selected examples for structure-toxicity relationships established by evaluation of both natural and semisynthetic aminoglycosides. The various assays and models used to evaluate these antibiotics and recent progress in development of safer aminoglycoside antibiotics are discussed.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, improvement in the prognosis of patients treated with AGs is overshadowed by frequently occurring toxic side effects that render them last-resort antibiotics. The main side effects caused are ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. 18, 19 In kidney proximal tubular cells (Fig. 1A) , AGs perturb with intracellular processes and induce the death of epithelial cells leading to tubular necrosis. Vestibular toxicity occurs due to damage to the vestibular cranial nerve branch responsible for balance, and cochlear toxicity occurs due to damage to cochlear hair cells and to the cranial nerve branch responsible for hearing (Fig. 1B ). An example of the destructive effects of geneticin, also termed G-418, on explants of mouse organ of corti is shown in Fig. 1C . Due to cochlear hair cell death, ototoxicity is mostly irreversible. Ototoxicity is dose dependent, and certain patients are genetically more sensitive to the damaging effects of these antibiotics. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Notably, when administered through inhalation for treatment of respiratory infections, the toxic side-effects of AGs are mitigated significantly. [25] [26] [27] The molecular basis for the different mechanisms responsible for resistance to AGs have been extensively studied, and detailed structural information about the enzymes that confer resistance to AGs through chemical modifications, the most frequently encountered bacterial resistance to AGs, is available. 6 In contrast, the full scope of cellular targets directly and indirectly affected by AGs leading to nephrotoxic and ototoxic side effects has not yet been resolved, making it challenging to devise rational directions to circumvent these toxicities. Success has been achieved in the development of semi-synthetic AGs that overcome enzyme-mediated deactivation. For example, dibekacin, arbekacin, and amikacin were approved for clinical use in the early 1970s, and positive phase III clinical trial results were reported for plazomicin, a semisynthetic derivative of the AG sisomicin, in 2018. 12, 28, 29 In contrast, there has been little effort to address the issue of AG-induced toxicity and, to date, no AGs modified with the intention of reducing ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are in clinical use. In this digest article we provide a short overview of the current mechanistic understanding of AG-induced toxicity and how structure-toxicity relationships can be studied using various models.",

For example, G-418, a highly toxic AG banned for clinical use, binds both the bacterial and the eukaryotic ribosomes with high affinity. 36, 37 Its high affinity to the eukaryotic decoding region results from high conformational plasticity between the target ribonucleotides and this AG. Convincing evidence for the effects of AGs on the two eukaryotic translation machineries were obtained through isolation of mitochondria from mammalian cells treated with different AGs and by development of in vitro translation assays using bacterial ribosomes engineered to have the A-site sequence of the human mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomes. [38] [39] [40] [41] A collection of X-ray structures of complexes between AGs and sequences of the bacterial and eukaryotic cytosolic and mitochondrial A-sites are available thereby setting the stage for rational design of AGs with higher selectivity for the bacterial ribosome. [42] [43] [44] [45] AG-induced perturbation of translation can take place in any eukaryotic cell, however, several unique features in inner ear hair cells and kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells make them more vulnerable to these antibiotics. AG-induced nephrotoxicity results from excessive accumulation of the antibiotic in the proximal tubular cells of the kidneys (Fig. 1A) . 18 Since AGs are largely unaffected by metabolism, they reach the kidneys intact and in high concentrations, therefore increasing the risk of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Treatment with AGs can, therefore, result in severe damage to kidney functions, and these antibiotics cannot be prescribed to patients suffering from a chronic kidney disease. Between 5 and 10% of adult patients treated with AGs have significant increases in serum creatinine, indicative of kidney malfunction. 8 Fortunately, since proximal tubular cells can regenerate, nephrotoxicity is usually reversible.",

Streptomycin and Dihydrostreptomycin have similar antibacterial potencies yet the latter has improved stability. 49 Although vestibular damage is less common with dihydrostreptomycin than with streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin more frequently causes hearing loss and symptoms are more severe than those caused by the parent AG. This resulted in removal of the first semisynthetic AG from the market. 49 Dur\u00e1n and co-workers compared the ototoxicity of paromomycin, neomycin, gentamicin (a mixture composed of a number of structurally related AGs), and gentamicin C1a, which is a major component of the gentamicin mixture (Fig. 2) . 46 Paromomycin and neomycin B differ solely by the chemical group at the 6\u2032 position: an alcohol in the case of paromomycin and a primary amine in the case of neomycin B.

In a preliminary study in humans an increase in serum creatinine occurred in 7% of the patients and no significant ototoxic effects were reported. 50, 51 We previously demonstrated that 5-O-ribosylation of 4,6- disubstituted-2-deoxystreptamine AGs containing a 2\u2032-equatorial amine resulted in improved selectivity for inhibition of prokaryotic over eukaryotic translation by cytosolic ribosomes. 10 For example, 5-O-ribosylation of nebramine, which yield 3\u2032-deoxy ribostamycin (Fig. 3) resulted in an increase of about 4-fold in the ratio of the IC 50 value for inhibition of eukaryotic translation divided by the IC 50 value for inhibition of prokaryotic translation compared to the ratio of the parent nebramine. The improved selectivity resulted from improvement in the inhibition of prokaryotic translation and reduction in the inhibition of cytosolic eukaryotic translation. 10 More recently we showed that 3\u2032\u2032-Ndemethylation of G-418 to yield 3\u2032\u2032-N-desmethyl G-418 (Fig. 3 ) markedly improved selectivity for inhibition of E. coli ribosomes compared to eukaryotic ribosomes. 11 Molecular dynamics simulations of complexes between these AGs and rRNA fragments corresponding to bacterial, eukaryotic cytosolic, and eukaryotic mitochondrial A-sites indicated that the minor N-demethylation modification to the G-418 scaffold, significantly altered the effect of the AG on the flexibility of the A-site. Furthermore, differences in A-site sequences, such as those that differentiate between the mitochondrial and bacterial A-sites, resulted in significant differences in interactions with AGs. 11 As an inner ear cell model immortalized mouse inner ear cells that express markers of auditory sensory cells (HEI-OC1 cells) were used to further assess cell viability in the presence of 3\u2033-N-desmethyl G-418 and the parent AG. 52, 53 The effect of the AGs on the viability of HEI-OC1 cells correlated well with their effects on cytosolic translation in vitro: G-418 inhibited eukaryotic cytosolic translation about 17-fold more potently than its 3\u2032\u2032-N-desmethyl derivative, and the parent AG was about an order of magnitude (~9-fold) more toxic to HEI-OC1 cells than its 3\u2032\u2032-N-desmethyl derivative. This result is of particular interest since N-demethylation of G-418 reduced the undesired inhibition of cytosolic eukaryotic translation without significantly affecting its antibacterial activity. 11 Propylamycin (Fig. 3) , a semisynthetic AG developed by Crich and co-workers, is another example of an AG carrying a simple modification that shows improved selectivity for the prokaryotic ribosome over both mitochondrial and cytosolic hybrid ribosomes. 14 The ototoxicity of propylamycin was assessed in the guinea pig model, in which the shift in threshold of auditory brain stem responses is used as a measure of ototoxicity. At all three frequencies tested, the threshold shifts for propylamycin only marginally increased from those of the untreated control animals over the tested dose range. In contrast, the clinically used AG gentamicin caused significant shifts. Microscopic examination of the guinea pigs' cochlear hair cells revealed the reduced ototoxicity of propylamycin compared to gentamicin. After propylamycin treatment, cochlear hair cells were comparable to those of the control, even in the basal turn, the region most sensitive to AGs, although gentamicin treatment resulted in extensive damage.",

Although AG-induced toxicity has been poorly addressed by drug designers, in recent years several groups have made progress toward deciphering how AGs influence various processes in eukaryotic cells with the goal of drawing structure-toxicity relationship guidelines that will facilitate the development of safer AG antibiotics. It is well established that the extent of perturbation of the two eukaryotic translation machineries, the ribosomes in the cytosol and those in the mitochondria, correlates well with the toxicity of AGs. Therefore, in vitro translation assays using bacterial or mammalian ribosomes and hybrid bacterial ribosomes containing the A-sites of either the mammalian cytosolic or mitochondrial ribosomes are useful tools to predict the extent of toxicity of most AG derivatives. However, due to the tremendous structural diversity among different members of the AG class of antibiotics, it is not surprising that we and others have provided experimental evidence for additional effects of AGs such as membrane permeabilization and stress response-mediated effects. These effects likely result from the interactions of AGs with targets other than the translation machineries, and their weight in the overall toxicity of the antibiotic depends on the specific AG and on the test model. Fortunately, chemical modification strategies can be applied to moderate the non-ribosomal effects as well. Selective delivery is another strategy that should be considered and further developed to reduce the toxicity of AGs. The fact that AG administration through inhalation, used for treatment of respiratory bacterial infections, reduces significantly their toxic side-effects, supports this hypothesis.",

This AG is not deactivated by most known AG-modifying enzymes and has not shown significant toxic side effects in animal models. While this AG did induce nephrotoxic effects in humans, it caused no significant ototoxic side effects during clinical trials. Moreover, recent examples reported by our group and by Crich and co-workers clearly demonstrate that chemical modifications can be harnessed to significantly improve the selectivity of AGs for the bacterial translation machinery and to reduce off-ribosomal toxicities without a significant loss of antibacterial activity.",
