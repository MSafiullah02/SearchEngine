Although cultures from both murine lines were similarly susceptible to NiV-EGFP infection at high multiplicity of infection (MOI, 1 PFU/cell; Figure 1C\u20131H), cultures derived from IFNAR-KO mice produced significantly more infectious particles than cultures from wild-type mice, when infected with a low dose of NiV (0.02 PFU/cell; Figure 1H), without significant differences in cell viability during the first 48 hours postinfection. In cultures from both wild-type and IFNAR-KO mice NiV induced strong production of IFN\u00df-specific messenger RNA (Figure 1I and 1J) at the similar level but not IFN\u03b1, which was detected only at the basal level (data not shown). These results suggested the importance of IFNAR signaling in the protection of primary brain cells from the infection with low doses of NiV, thus encouraging further in vivo experiments with this murine model.\n",

Mice presented a painful face (orbital tightening, nose bulge, and ears and whiskers drawn back position) as referred in the mouse grimace scale [26], lordosis, aggressiveness, and prostration.

However, the RNA levels in HeV intranasally infected mice were statistically lower in all organs (P < .005), compared to intraperitoneally infected mice (Figure 3A). This correlated with the survival of all mice infected intranasally with HeV (Figure 2C), suggesting that intranasal inoculation of HeV results in systemic infection but at lower level than intraperitoneal infection route. Expression of NiV N followed the similar pattern as HeV N expression in intraperitoneally infected mice (Figure 3B), with apparently higher level of NiV-N expression in lungs of NiV-infected IFNAR-KO mice than in intraperitoneal HeV-infected mice, in accord to higher susceptibility of these mice to intranasal infection (Figure 2B and 2C). In contrast to IFNR-KO mice, C57BL/6 mice showed only very low level of RNA copies of NiV-N in the lung (2 samples) and in the spleen (1 sample) and were under detection level in the other organs.

In NiV-infected animals, focal necrosis and petechial hemorrhages were observed in the liver and kidney. No particular lesions of liver and kidney were noticed in HeV-infected animals. Less frequently, congestion of the lungs and edema of the bladder wall were also observed. Upon histological and immunohistological analysis of organs from infected IFNAR-KO mice, both viruses appeared to affect the brain, causing parenchymal and meningeal nonsuppurative inflammation, the former being predominant after HeV infection. Vascular lesions were numerous and included wide-spread vasculitis, often associated with hemorrhages (Figure 4D), leukocyte infiltration, and perivascular cuffing (Figure 4G). Neurons close to sites of vasculitis and meningitis lesions showed eosinophilic inclusions. suggesting a hypoxic-ischemic state in the brain (Figure 4G). IHC analysis of the brain from both NiV- and HeV-infected IFNAR-KO mice revealed infected ependymal cells (Figure 4L) and neuron-shaped cells (Figure 4J), which was further confirmed by immunofluorescence (Figure 5). Histopathology of lungs revealed intense inflammation with edema, focal necrotizing alveolitis (Figure 4E), and vasculitis (Figure 4H). IHC indicated the presence of NiV antigen in different cell types, including pneumocytes (Figure 4K) and cells from the pseudostratified epithelium. Hepatic lesions observed in NiV-infected animals were severe, with signs of acute and intense hepatitis. Focal necrosis, as well as vasculitis, large syncytia, hemorrhages, and inflammation were abundant (Figure 4F). In HeV-infected animals, hepatic lesions were not significant (Figure 4I). Histopathology of the kidney showed moderate inflammation associated with light vasculitis (data not shown). In contrast to IFNAR-KO mice, the histopathological findings in C57BL/6 were poor, with only occasionally noticed very mild inflammation of the brain (2 out of 6 analyzed samples, data not shown). Furthermore, no viral protein could be detected by IHC.\n",

However, surviving IFNAR-KO mice, infected with HeV by both intraperitoneal and intranasal routes, developed seroneutralizing antibodies 3 weeks postinfection (Figure 6A). In correlation to their higher susceptibility to HeV infection, younger mice (4 weeks old) developed significantly higher titer of neutralizing Abs compared to 12-week-old IFNAR-KO intranasally infected mice (P = .0263). Production of neutralizing Abs in intranasally NiV-infected mice was also rather low (Figure 6B).

            "text": "This study analyzes the role of type I IFN system in henipavirus pathogenesis and demonstrates the critical role of IFNAR signaling in the protection of mice from lethal HeV and NiV infection. IFN-I can exert antiviral effects at multiple levels, causing the induction of antiviral genes as well as augmentation of antigen-presenting cell and lymphocyte functions. IFN-I may affect the survival of diverse cell populations: it could prolong neuron and astrocyte survival following growth factor deprivation or serum starvation [27, 28]. It has been hypothesized that the ability of IFNs to inhibit cell death may preserve neuronal populations and limit disease in the central nervous system (CNS) induced by either viral infection or inflammation [29]. The selective increased permissiveness of primary brain glial cultures lacking IFNAR signaling after infection with NiV at low but not high MOI strongly suggests that mouse cells can efficiently detect NiV infection and secrete IFN-I to protect surrounding cells from virus spreading, although NiV-induced production of IFN-I by neuronal cells may be limited [30]. Only a small population of infected neurons produces IFN-I following infection with certain viruses, and IFN-I was shown to be principally made by parenchymal cells in the brain [31]. Our results have demonstrated the critical importance of IFNAR signaling for the protection of mice from henipavirus infection in vivo. In addition to the local protection of brain cells from infection, it is also possible that systemic transmission of the virus, retrograde axonal transport, and neuroinvasion are more efficient in the absence of the functional IFN-I system, as shown for poliovirus [32], and could thus contribute to the higher suceptibility of IFNAR-KO mice to henipavirus infection. Altogether, these results are consistent with infection of IFNAR-KO mice with other neurotropic RNA viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus [20], measles [33], coronavirus [34], or West Nile virus infection [35], in which the absence of IFNAR downstream signaling highly increases the susceptibility to infection.",

HeV and NiV encode several proteins that block IFN-I in different cell types and thus counteract innate immune response [36], and resistance to henipavirus infection in mice may be linked to inability of viral proteins to interact with their homologous murine molecular partner. Understanding the underlying mechanism, by which henipavirus infection is so efficiently controlled in mice, may help the development of more effective countermeasures in humans. Furthermore, the critical role of IFN-I signaling in control of the HeV and NiV infection observed in this study, and recent observations that in human cell lines NiV and HeV inhibit IFN-I production rather than IFN-I signaling pathways [37], as well as previous finding that interferon inducer poly(I)-poly(C(12)U) could prevent Nipah virus-induced mortality [38], suggest a potential for IFN-I treatment as a possible postexposure therapeutic.",

            "text": "Both NiV and HeV are disseminated rapidly to different organs of IFNAR-KO mice, following intraperitoneal infection and are transmitted to the brain, where they induce lethal encephalitis. Similarly to henipavirus infection in human [39, 40], infected mice developed neurological signs and CNS pathology, with parenchymal brain cell infection, meningitis, and vasculits-induced microinfarctions, most probably responsible for the lethal outcome of the disease. Histopathological studies in different organs revealed the presence of widespread vasculitis, hemorrhages, and strong inflammation. Thus, these results emphasize number of similarities between this new IFNAR-KO mouse model and the well-established hamster model [12, 13], although the LD50 was much higher in mice than in hamsters, suggesting that they may differ from hamsters in some additional factor(s) important for henipavirus infection. Previous work suggested that infection of hamsters with a high dose of NiV or HeV resulted in acute respiratory distress, whereas low doses induced the development of neurological signs and more systemic spread of the virus [41]. In agreement to their lower susceptibility, development of mainly neurological disease in this murine model suggests that the infection of IFNAR-KO mice with henipavirus mimics the low-dose infection of hamsters. Furthermore, as shown in hamsters [12], IFNAR-KO mice were more susceptible to intraperitoneal than to intranasal NiV infection. In the latter route of inoculation, they displayed the progression of neuronal signs, along with breath difficulties in 60% of infected animals, followed by delayed mortality compared to intraperitoneally infected mice. Finally, and in compliance with the hamster model [13], we have observed the age-related susceptibility to intraperitoneal HeV infection in mice, which declines with older age of animals. Curiously, IFNAR-KO mice were not susceptible to HeV by the intranasal route. Significantly lower level of HeV N was detected in different organs of intranasally infected mice, compared to intraperitoneally infected mice, indicating that some virus replication did take place but was probably insufficient to lead to mortality. These results may reflect some differential permissiveness of the murine respiratory system to initial stages of NiV and HeV replication, possibly related to distribution and/or different binding affinity for the entry receptors [14]. Likewise, in hamster model NiV initially replicates in the upper respiratory tract epithelium, whereas HeV initiates infection in the interstitium of the lungs and not in the trachea or bronchi [41].",

Since henipavirus infection elicits production of high levels of neutralizing antibodies in IFNAR-KO mice, these animals thus constitute a useful model to evaluate vaccination strategies against henipavirus. Furthermore and as opposed to other characterized models, this new murine model provides access to the numerous and powerful tools available for mice, which should be of critical help for in-depth immunobiological and genetic studies of henipavirus infection and could substantially promote the discovery of new therapeutic and prophylactic targets as well as the assessment of drug candidates and vaccines.",
