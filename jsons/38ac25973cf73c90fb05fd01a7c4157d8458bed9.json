In the United States, 161 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released a COVID-19 162 Serology Surveillance Strategy [7] .

            "text": "While the FDA has approved various RDTs for use under Emergency Use Authorization, 176 the WHO currently does not recommend their use outside of research purposes due to 177 their inconsistent sensitivities [18]. Indeed, concerns over reports of false negative results 178 prompted an FDA news release cautioning the public about the potential inaccuracy of 179 Abbott's ID NOW point-of-care RDT [13-17, 19]. Further studies with larger sample 180 sizes and clear manufacturer instructions for correct sampling are needed in order to 181 determine whether RDTs are reliable for clinical use. 182 Conclusion 183 The aforementioned values for sensitivity and specificity are likely to change as 184 more samples are obtained. However, their values as stipulated here are used not to 185 endorse a particular test, but to illustrate the concept of prevalence thresholds in the 186 context of the current pandemic. To illustrate the methods herein described, we provide 187 the example of the screening strategies used in the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, 188 and calculate the prevalence threshold statistics of different tests available today. This 189 concept can help contextualize the validity of a screening test in real time, thereby 190 enhancing our understanding of the dynamics of the current pandemic. [Identifying where 191 this prevalence point lies in the curve has important implications for the interpretation of 192 test results, the administration of healthcare systems, the implementation of public health 193 measures, and in cases of pandemics like SARS-CoV-2, the functioning of society at 194 large. 195All rights reserved.
