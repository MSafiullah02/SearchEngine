Certainly, the reduction in nonurgent procedures including ablations, coronary interventions, device implantations, and transcatheter valve interventions also reduces the number of patients with HF admitted to the hospital. We speculate that self-quarantine may interact with common triggers for HF decompensation as well as HF physiology to reduce decompensation through several mechanisms. Lastly, but more concerning, is the possibility that patients have developed worsening symptoms but are reticent to seek medical attention due to concerns of COVID-19 exposure. If this were true, one might expect an increase in the number of phone calls or emergency room visits, but anecdotally this is not happening.",

Wiener Cardiovascular Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in New York City (NYC) was on March 1, and as of April 24 there were 895,766 cases and 50,439 deaths across the United States (US) due to COVID-19.(1) With nearly one-third of all US cases in New York (NY), it remains an epicenter of the pandemic.",

            "text": ", dietary indiscretions may have lessened given a significant reduction in the number of restaurants remaining open for business. It is well known that the average sodium content of restaurant food is higher than home cooked (even canned) food items. (2) Despite this, the restaurant and fast-food industry has not closed down completely, and continuation of some delivery and take-out options make this factor less likely to account for a large reduction in HF admissions. Second, medication adherence may have improved. Several factors could have contributed to an increased likelihood of medication adherence, including near elimination of travel -patients rely heavily on public transportation in NYC and patients may skip medications, particularly diuretics, when they know they have long travel times. With stay-at-home orders in place, patients may be more likely to take their medications. Perhaps there is an increased awareness and desire to avoid the hospital, which may indirectly affect medication and dietary adherence. Third, follow-up care has continued using a new model of outpatient care delivery. Our institution rapidly deployed virtual visits as a way to provide longitudinal care while also reducing patient exposure and slowing the spread of disease. The feasibility of this approach was recently demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial (3) and endorsed by the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA). (4) While this may be helpful in preventing readmission in the shortterm, there is uncertainty about the mid-and long-term implications of employing this technology. Will GDMT up-titration suffer due to the limited ability to monitor blood pressure, heart rate and laboratory values? Will we see a rebound increase in emergency room visits and HF hospitalizations? How will vulnerable patients, such as the elderly, and those of lower socioeconomic status or residing in long-term care facilities be affected by this transition of care?Fourth, there has almost certainly been reduced energy expenditure. From a physiological standpoint, self-isolated patients may experience a significant reduction in daily energy expenditure. It has been demonstrated by invasive hemodynamic monitoring that patients hospitalized with HF placed on bed rest experience the equivalent of a vasodilatory response with reduction in mean arterial pressure, left ventricular filling pressures, and increase in cardiac output. (5) Perhaps a similar phenomenon is occurring at home. Has matching between energy supply and demand improved and is this why fewer patients are admitted for HF?",
