Respiratory viral syndromes include common cold, pharyngitis, tracheobronchitis, croup, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia, and viruses implicated include influenza, parainfluenza, enteroviruses, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses (RV), and coronaviruses. It is likely that additional viruses exist but await identification. A human metapneumovirus [1] was recently discovered to be the cause of symptoms in young children ranging from upper respiratory tract (URT) disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. In a subsequent Japanese seroprevalence study for metapneumovirus, all children had been exposed by age 10 [2]. Further attention has been focused on respiratory virus infection as a result of the current epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, for which the causative agent appears to be a novel coronavirus [3].",

Just how the immunopathology of respiratory virus infection interacts with the pre\u2010existing immunopathology of such diseases is currently not well understood. Data concerning viral immunopathology are available from studies of natural infection, from in vitro studies predominantly concentrating on epithelial cell (EC) culture or preparations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and from in vivo experimental infection using animal models or human volunteers. RV are the most frequent virus type identified during exacerbations, and RV infections in asthma and COPD are the major focus of our center's research. This article will concentrate on data available for RV infection in normal, healthy individuals and in patients with obstructive airways diseases, but it must be emphasized that the immunopathogenesis of disease as a result of other virus types may be very different. The response of cells of the epithelium of the respiratory tract following virus infection will have a major influence on the subsequent host\u2010immune response, and this will be considered in detail in this review.",

Exposure to viruses is reflected in the rapid accumulation of antibodies to RV in particular [5] and RSV [6, 7] in the first years of life. Seventy percent of wheezing episodes in the first year are associated with viral respiratory infection [8]; RSV, RV, and influenza B are most frequently cultured [9]. In some children, RSV causes bronchiolitis, a potentially serious lower respiratory tract (LRT) illness with a significant mortality [10], which is associated with an increased risk of subsequent asthma [11]. The potential causative and/or protective role of viruses in the development of subsequent asthma remains controversial and has been recently reviewed [12, 13].",

The health costs of this condition are enormous in terms of time off school, GP consultations, hospital admissions, and mortality. Viral infections are a major asthma trigger in older children and adults. Their role may have been underestimated in early studies, limited to viral culture and serology and lacking sensitive methods for detection of RV and coronaviruses. The introduction of molecular biology [polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ hybridization, and in situ PCR] has implicated viruses in the majority of exacerbations. Direct evidence implicating viruses comes from studies showing increased detection during asthma attacks [9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. The highest rates of detection are from prospective studies with sampling as soon as symptoms commence. In a 1\u2010year longitudinal study performed in Southampton, UK, upper respiratory viral infections were associated with 80\u201385% of asthma exacerbations in school\u2010age children. One hundred eight children, aged 9\u201311, were selected by questionnaire on the basis of episodic wheeze or cough, and diary cards were used to monitor respiratory symptoms and peak flows. Viruses were detected in 80% of reported episodes of reduced peak expiratory flow (PEF), in 80% of reported episodes of wheeze, and in 85% of reported episodes of upper respiratory symptoms, cough, wheeze, and a fall in PEF. The most commonly identified virus type was RV. In a related study, viral URT infections (URTI) were strongly associated in time with hospital admissions for asthma in children and adults [35]. The half\u2010monthly rates of URTI were compared with the half\u2010monthly rates for hospital asthma admissions for the same time period for the hospitals serving the areas from which the cohort of schoolchildren was drawn. Strong correlations were found between the seasonal patterns of URTI and hospital asthma admissions; this relationship was stronger for pediatric than for adult admissions. URTI and asthma admissions were more frequent during periods of school attendance (87% of pediatric and 84% of total admissions) than during the school holidays. Up to 44% of exacerbations in adult asthmatics was associated with the presence of respiratory virus infection [36, 37]. Virus detection between exacerbations when asymptomatic is only 3\u201312%. In contrast, transtracheal aspirates in adult exacerbations [38] yield sparse bacterial cultures with no correlation to clinical illness and no difference from normal subjects. If an asthmatic child develops infection in which RV, coronavirus, or RSV is cultured, the risk of associated asthma attack is 50\u201370% [39]. In asthmatics, the predominant viruses are RV, RSV, and parainfluenza. RV is detected in 50% of virus\u2010induced asthma attacks. Adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses are also detected but less frequently. Influenza is found during annual epidemics. Although metapneumovirus has been associated with URT symptoms, it has not been associated with asthma in a small study of children with asthma [40].",

Participants completed daily diary cards of URT and LRT symptoms and measured PEF twice daily. Every 2 weeks, nasal aspirates were taken and examined for RV, which was detected in 10.1% of samples from participants with asthma and 8.5% of samples from healthy participants. Groups did not differ in the frequency of URTI or the severity or duration of symptoms associated with RV infection. However, first, RV infection was associated more frequently with LRTI in participants with asthma than in healthy individuals, and LRT symptoms associated with RV infection were significantly more severe and longer\u2010lasting in asthmatics than in healthy controls.",

            "text": "Increasing interest in the clinical features and pathogenesis of COPD reflects the worldwide importance of the disease. More than 14 million patients are affected in the United States alone. It is predicted to become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020. National and global initiatives have been launched, and management guidelines have been published [42]. Fewer studies have examined the epidemiology of virus infection in COPD. Many exacerbations of COPD occur without the hallmarks of bacterial infection\u2010increased volume or purulence of sputum. Between 33% and 70% of exacerbations are associated with symptoms of the common cold. The frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization is higher in the winter, and one explanation for this could be the increased frequency of respiratory viruses at this time of the year. A recent study followed COPD patients attending the London Chest Hospital over a 16\u2010month period [43]. The effects of respiratory viral infection on the time course of COPD exacerbation were examined by monitoring changes in systemic inflammatory markers in stable COPD and at exacerbation. Eighty\u2010three patients with COPD recorded daily PEF and any increases in respiratory symptoms. Nasal samples and blood were taken for respiratory virus detection by culture, PCR, and serology, and plasma fibrinogen and serum interleukin (IL)\u20106 were determined at stable baseline and exacerbation. Sixty\u2010four percent of exacerbations were associated with a cold, occurring up to 18 days before exacerbation. Seventy\u2010seven viruses (58.2% RV) were detected in 39.2% of 168 COPD exacerbations in 53 patients. Again, earlier studies relying on serology and virus culture have quoted lower virus detection rates of 15\u201320% [44, 45, 46, 47]. Viral exacerbations were associated with increased dyspnea, a higher total symptom count at presentation, a longer median symptom recovery period of 13 days, and a tendency toward higher plasma fibrinogen and serum IL\u20106 levels. Non\u2010RSV respiratory viruses were detected in 16% and RSV, in 23.5% of 68 stable COPD patients. Where RSV was identified in patients with stable COPD, these individuals had a higher plasma fibrinogen and serum IL\u20106, a higher pCO2, and increased frequency of exacerbations. This suggests that low\u2010grade, persistent RSV infection contributes to COPD severity, patients with more severe COPD are less able to clear RSV from the airway, or that in some patients, RSV is resulting in detectable, inflammatory changes but no significant symptoms.",

Patients with frequent exacerbations had a significantly faster decline in FEV1 and PEF than infrequent exacerbators and were more often admitted to the hospital with longer lengths of stay. Frequent exacerbations were a consistent feature within a patient for different years of the study and were associated with an increased rate of bacterial colonization of the lower airway when stable [51].",

Until recently, a problem with the experimental RV infection model was the uncertainty as to whether RV infection occurred in the lower airway as well as in the URT. Although nasopharyngeal contamination cannot be ruled out, RV has been detected in lower airway specimens such as sputum [23], tracheal brushings [64], and BAL [68] by reverse transcriptase\u2010PCR and culture. RV has been cultured in cell lines of bronchial EC origin [69, 70], and replication has been demonstrated in primary culture of bronchial EC [71, 72]. Preference of RV for culture at 33\u00b0C has been used as an argument against lower airway infection, but there is now evidence that replication does occur at temperatures found in the lower airway [73]. In fact, thermistor studies show that only in the peripheral lung does airway temperature rise above 35\u00baC [74]. Finally, in situ hybridization shows RV in bronchial biopsies of subjects following experimental infection [71], as previously demonstrated in nasal washing cells [75] and nasal biopsies [52]. This evidence strongly supports a direct lower respiratory epithelial reaction as the initial event in the induction of RV\u2010mediated asthma exacerbations.",

With detailed monitoring, it is possible to detect reductions in PEF [77] and home recordings of FEV1 in atopic asthmatic patients in the acute phase of experimental RV16 infection [62]. There is an enhanced sensitivity to histamine and allergen challenge after RV16 inoculation in nonasthmatic, atopic rhinitic subjects [57, 67]. RV16 increases asthma symptoms, coinciding with an increase in the maximal bronchoconstrictive response to methacholine up to 15 days after infection [58].

In a recent study of experimental RV16 infection in subjects with allergic rhinitis or asthma, the balance of airway types 1 and 2 cytokines in induced sputum (IS) induced by viral infection was related to symptoms and viral clearance. An inverse correlation was demonstrated between the ratio of IFN\u2010\u03b3 to IL\u20105 mRNA and peak cold symptoms.

In allergic rhinitics, experimental RV infection increases BAL eosinophils following segmental allergen challenge, again persisting for 6 weeks [66], and increased levels of ECP are found in the sputum of RV\u2010infected subjects [61]. Eosinophils accumulate in the airway under the influence of IL\u20105, GM\u2010CSF, IL\u20108, RANTES, and eotaxin [136]. Of these, only IL\u20105 is not produced by airway EC in vitro after infection by RV. Expression of RANTES is increased in nasal secretions of children with natural virus\u2010induced asthma [137]. RANTES is up\u2010regulated in primary nasal EC cultures by RSV [138] and RV [72]. GM\u2010CSF is important in bone marrow eosinophil production and in eosinophil survival [136], but levels are not increased during viral URTI [137, 139]. Levels of eotaxin in NL rise after experimental RV16 infection [140]. These data suggest a pathogenic role for eosinophils in virus\u2010induced asthma. However, a protective role is also possible. In allergic rhinitic subjects infected with RV after high\u2010dose allergen challenge, the severity and duration of cold symptoms were inversely related to the NL eosinophil count before infection [141]. Eosinophils may contribute to viral antigen presentation. Eosinophils pretreated with GM\u2010CSF bind RV16 via ICAM\u20101 and present viral antigen to RV16\u2010specific T cells, inducing proliferation and secretion of IFN\u2010\u03b3 [142]. Eosinophils have antiviral actions in parainfluenza\u2010infected guinea pigs [143]. Eosinophil\u2010derived neurotoxin and ECP have RNase activity and reduce RSV infectivity [144].
