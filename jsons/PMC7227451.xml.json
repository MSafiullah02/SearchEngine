By creating single amino acid substitution mutations in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBM sequences, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 has two types of amino acid residues to maintain its binding activity with hACE2: receptor binding was enhanced by introducing amino acid changes at P499, Q493, F486, A475 and L455, and receptor binding was diminished by replacing residues N501, Q498, E484, T470, K452 and R439. An animal immunization study revealed that the RBDs of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are potential antigens that induce strong clade-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, while the cross-neutralizing effect is much weaker. This finding was due to the differences in antigenicity of the RBDs in the 2 viruses, which was carefully verified with the available neutralizing monoclonal antibodies(mAbs) against SARS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV-2. Finally, the potential epitope of HA001, a newly developed SARS-CoV-2 receptor-blocking human antibody, was found to involve amino acids A475 and F486 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, which are newly discovered binding sites for neutralizing antibodies.",

The HEK293T cells expressing or not expressing hACE2 were treated with pseudo-typed virus-containing supernatants. The pseudo-typed SARS-CoV and SARS CoV-2 showed much higher infectivity in the HEK293T cells expressing hACE2 than they did in the HEK293T cells not expressing hACE2, while there was no significant difference in the pseudo-typed VSVG infectivity in the HEK293T cells with or without hACE2 (Fig. 1a). The results indicated that hACE2 is a receptor used by both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cells. Because syncytial formation has been observed in cultured Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV,16 we also sought to determine whether HEK293T cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein could fuse with HEK293T cells expressing hACE2. As expected, the HEK293T cells transfected with hACE2 formed many syncytia with cells expressing the SARS-CoV S protein. In contrast, for the 293T cells expressing hACE2, the S protein of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 alone did not form syncytia. The HEK293T cells expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 also efficiently formed syncytia with hACE2-transfected cells (Fig. 1b). As the RBD is the key region for SARS-CoV S-hACE2 recognition, we investigated the binding affinity of hACE2 and S protein though biolayer interferometry (BLI) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The biotin-conjugated hACE2 protein was captured by streptavidin that was immobilized on a chip and tested for binding with gradient concentrations of soluble RBD from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to hACE2 was calculated to be 5.09 nM, which is comparable to that of the SARS-RBD: 1.46 nM6 (Fig. 1d). Similar data were obtained through ELISAs (Fig. 1c). Taken together, these results confirmed that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 utilize the RBD to bind to hACE2 for virus entry.",

To address this question, we conducted an in vivo immunization experiment to determine the cross-reactivity of the antibodies induced by the SARS-CoV RBD and SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 2a). First, we performed ELISAs to detect the cross-reactivity of the sera from mice immunized with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD or SARS-CoV RBD. The results showed that the SARS-CoV RBD antiserum reacted strongly to the SARS-CoV RBD, with a mean antibody titre of 1.701 \u00d7 104 and with a lower titre upon SARS-CoV-2 RBD exposure (mean antibody titre: 3.1 \u00d7 102). Similarly, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD antiserum reacted strongly to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, with a high antibody titre (7.53 \u00d7 104) and with a lower titre upon SARS-CoV RBD exposure (2.19 \u00d7 103) (Fig. 2b). Correspondingly, we investigated the efficiency of the antiserum cross-blocking of the interaction between hACE2 and the S protein RBD. The results revealed that the SARS-CoV RBD antiserum strongly blocked the interaction between hACE2 and the SARS-CoV RBD with a mean 50% blocking antiserum titre (BT50: 1.68 \u00d7 103) but very low BT50 upon exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (BT50: 73.6). Similarly, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD antiserum had a higher 50% blocking antiserum titre (BT50: 3.12 \u00d7 103) for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2 interaction but much lower cross-blocking efficiency for the SARS-CoV RBD and hACE2 interaction (BT50: 1.65 \u00d7 102) (Fig. 2c). To confirm this observation, a pseudo-typed virus neutralization assay was performed to evaluate the cross-neutralization efficacy of the SARS-CoV RBD- or SARS-CoV-2 RBD-immunized mouse antiserum. In agreement with the results from the blocking assay, the neutralization activity of the mouse antisera was near completely clade-specific with very low cross-neutralization levels. The 50% neutralization antiserum titre (NT50) of the SARS-CoV-2 antiserum to the SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-typed virus was calculated to be 1.49 \u00d7 104, and that of the SARS-CoV antiserum to the SARS-CoV pseudo-typed virus was 8.15 \u00d7 103 (Fig. 2d). Therefore, these results suggest that there is distinct immunogenicity in the SARS-CoV RBD and SARS-CoV-2 RBD, explaining the limited amount of cross-protecting antibodies produced by the two viruses.",

            "text": "It is well known that the interaction of the interface between S-RBD and ACE2 plays a crucial role in their binding activity, with the RBM regions considered to be particularly important.5 However, the amino acids of the RBM were quite different, with a shared identity of only 47.8%. It was not clear which mutated residues within the RBM would alter its affinity for hACE2; thus, a functional analysis was needed. Based on the sequence alignment (Fig. 3a), 19 residues were selected, and single amino acid substitutions were added to mutate the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBM regions. The results showed that, in some mutants, the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with hACE2 were decreased, but for others, it was increased or not affected (Fig. 3b). According to the high-resolution crystal structure information acquired thus far,5\u20137,11,12 the receptor-binding motif (RBM) is composed of two regions (region 1 and region 2) that form the interface of the S protein with hACE2, and we focused on the residues within either region 1 or region 2 (Fig. 3c).17 Interestingly, after 9 amino acid residues were mutated in the SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV (L455/Y442, F456/L443, S459/G46, Q474/S461, A475/P462, F486/L472, F490/W476, Q493/N479 and P499/T485), their binding affinity for hACE2 was abolished, in contrast to that of the WT viruses (Fig. 3b, c), indicating that these residues are very important for the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to hAEC2. It is worth noting that 6 of the 9 residues, L455, F456, A475, F486, F490 and Q493, have been previously reported to be SARS-CoV-2 RBD-hACE2 interacting residues based on structure analysis.5\u20137 According to structure analysis, L455 and Q493 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD have favourable interactions with hACE2 K31 and E35; upon binding, the salt bridge between the two hACE2 residues breaks, and each of the residues forms a hydrogen bond with Q493 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, thus enhancing the binding to hACE26 (Fig. 3c), a finding in agreement with our mutagenesis results (Fig. 3b). The introduction of F486 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD enhanced the hACE2 binding affinity by creating a hydrophobic pocket involving M82 and Y83 in hACE26 (Fig. 3c). In addition, we report here, for the first time, that the other three SARS-CoV-2 substitution mutants, S459/G443, Q474/S461 and P499/T485, which do not directly contact hACE2, also reduce the binding affinity. These three SARS-CoV-2 residues may strengthen the structure and stabilize the hACE2-SARS-CoV-2 binding interface.",

We speculate that these residues may be critical for SARS-CoV RBD binding to hACE2. As expected, for SARS-CoV, when R426, K439, N457, P470, Y484 and T487 were replaced with the corresponding residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the binding activity of the SARS-CoV RBD was dramatically decreased compared with that of the RBD in the WT virus (Fig. 3e). Previous structural studies identified R426, Y484 and T487 as key residues for the SARS-CoV RBD binding to hACE2,4,18 which was confirmed based on the data provided above (Fig. 3d). According to the structure analysis, the replacement of SARS-CoV-2 RBD N439 with R426 increased the hACE2 binding affinity by introducing a strong salt bridge between R426 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and E329 in hACE2 (Fig. 3d). Molecular docking showed that the substitution of SARS-CoV-2 RBD Q498 with Y484 formed \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions with Y41 on hACE2, although hydrogen bonds were also involved, which explains the enhanced hACE2 binding (Fig. 3f). Moreover, according to the structural data, both SARS-CoV-2 RBD N501 and SARS-CoV RBD T487 have similar interactions with Y41 and K353 in hACE2, but the replacement of SARS-CoV-2 RBD N501 with T487 significantly enhanced its binding with ACE2. The enhanced binding activity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutant N501/T487 may be due to the increased support provided by this residue to stabilize the overall structure of RBD or strengthen the network of hydrophilic interactions (Fig. 3d). These results suggest that some residues critical for SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 recognition, namely, R426, K439, N457, P470, Y484 and T487, were different at the corresponding positions in SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, the key residues for SARS-CoV-2 recognition, L455, A475, F486 and Q493, were also different at the corresponding positions in SARS-CoV-2.",

As expected, the SARS-CoV-RBD mAbs neutralized SARS-CoV with IC50 values ranging from 0.016 to 2.0 \u00b5g/ml, and HA001 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 value of 0.016 \u00b5g/ml (Fig. 4d). These data indicate that the tested mAbs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RBD could not cross protect SARS-CoV, and vice versa, which may be due to the different sequence of the RBDs in the two viruses.

However, how the variable parts of the RBMs in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV affect receptor recognition had not been well illustrated. In this study, we demonstrated that, six single-amino acid substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 RBD resulted in the loss of favourable interactions with hACE2, namely, N501, Q498, E484, T470, K452 and R439. We also demonstrated that, 5 single amino acid substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 RBD enhanced SARS-CoV-2 RBD-hACE2 binding activity, namely, P499, Q493, F486, A475 and L455. These findings, together with the results of other substitution mutations, confirmed the hypothesis of other published structural articles. Our work provides evidence for the convergent evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS CoV RBDs and reveals a good example of a functional compensatory evolution mechanism.24,25",

The difference in the RBM amino acid sequence raises a new question: Are the protective antigenic sites in the RBD different among SARS-CoVs? We found that the antigenicity antigenic sites of the RBD were distinct in the 2 viruses. We tested a panel of neutralizing mAbs targeting the SARS-CoV RBD, and only one of these antibodies, named CR3022, was able to recognize the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, but it had no neutralizing activity. Notably, the IC50 of CR3022 for neutralizing the SARS-CoV pseudo-typed virus was much higher than that of the other four antibodies tested. The latest report from Meng Yuan et al.13 revealed the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with CR3022 and showed that the conserved epitope centred on the S protein did not overlap with the hACE2-binding RBM interface. We also tested a human neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2, named HA001 and purchased from Shanghai Sanyou Biopharma, that showed high-binding affinity for and neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 but no cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV.",

This amino acid was also important for SARS-CoV S-hACE2 binding. Considering that Y484 in SARS-CoV S protein was substituted with Q498 corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 S, this residue may be one of the key amino acids that contributes to the antigenic variation. The speculated epitopes of HA001 was identified as two hACE2 contacting amino acids, A475 and F486, in the SARS-CoV-2 RBM region, which may be new sites for neutralizing antibody binding. Using ELISAs, we also demonstrated that the antisera from mice immunized with mammalian cells expressed recombinant RBDs of SARS-CoV and SARS CoV-2 showed high binding affinity for and neutralizing activity against the respective homologous virus, while the cross-binding and neutralizing activity was much weaker. These results indicated that the RBD domain is a good immunogen to induce clade-specific neutralizing antibodies for disrupting virus-receptor engagement. Regarding the possibility of inducing cross-neutralizing antibodies by immunizing mice with the SARS-CoV RBD, several studies have indicated that natural infection with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and immunization of animals with the SARS-CoV RBD induced very limited cross-neutralizing S protein-targeting antibody responses,26,27 which is consistent with our observation.",

First, although it was not easy to induce cross-protective antibodies, the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 was a potential antigen that could induce abundant neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, potentially making it a good candidate for developing subunit vaccines. Second, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RBM-specific neutralizing mAbs prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking hACE2 interactions and hence are promising passive antibody-based agents in the absence of an effective prophylactic vaccine. Moreover, the identification of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV residues important for ACE2 and neutralizing antibody recognition sheds light on the pathogenicity and immune escape mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2.",
