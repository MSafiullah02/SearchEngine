In other words, most oncologists are exposed to a significant and high amount of patient suffering and death; therefore, the variance between them does not result in implications for their compassion fatigue.",

In our study, these subjective experiences were represented by the oncologists\u2019 grief and sense of failure. The greater significance of subjective aspects over objective ones in the development of emotional distress has been revealed in previous studies among different samples [26\u201328]. For example, Braun and colleagues showed the preeminence of subjective aspects, over objective ones, of caregiving burden in predicting caregivers\u2019 depression among caregiver spouses of patients with advanced cancer [26].",

As reported herein, oncologists are indeed highly exposed to the suffering and deaths of their patients. Unlike other professional caregivers (e.g., psychotherapists), oncologists do not learn about their patients\u2019 traumas merely through patients\u2019 reports and stories; rather, they witness their patients\u2019 suffering firsthand. Moreover, oncologists often perceive themselves as being responsible for the suffering experienced by their patients, and even for their deaths [18]. Therefore, the repeated experiences of grief and sense of failure can be regarded as primary traumas experienced by the oncologists themselves [15, 17, 29], rather than as secondary exposure to traumatic experiences. It is possible that oncologists develop compassion fatigue in response to their primary exposure to the trauma of repeated loss and perceived failure, and not only in response to their secondary exposure to suffering and death.",
