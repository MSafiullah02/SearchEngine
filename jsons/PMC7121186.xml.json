            "text": "\nLung development and ageing. Tissue-specific inactivation of Dicer in lung epithelium led to the conclusion that Dicer is essential for proper lung morphogenesis (34). During lung development, a maternally imprinted miRNA cluster located at human chromosome 14q32.21 (mouse chromosome 12F2) is upregulated in neonatal mouse as well as in fetal human lung. This locus includes the miR-154 and miR-335 families and is situated within the imprinted Gtl2-Dio3 domain. Several miRNAs are upregulated in adult compared to neonatal/fetal lung, including miR-29a and miR-29b. Williams et al. observed no significant changes in the expression of 256 miRNAs, over lung ageing up to 18 months of age in female BALB/c mice (35). A parallel by Navarro et al. between embryonic lung and lung tumors reported a downregulation of members of the let-7 family and an overexpression of members of the miR-17-92 cluster and of miR-221 (36). More recently, Marcet et al. (36a) have established miRNA expression profiles specific of in vitro regeneration of airway epithelial cells. The most dramatic variations occurred at the onset of ciliogenesis, with the increased expression of 12 microRNAs (miR-449a, miR-449b, miR-449b*, miR-449c, miR-34a, miR-34b-3p, miR-34b-5p, miR-34c-5p, miR-92b, miR-191, miR-1975, miR-125a), and the decreased expression of 11 microRNAs (miR-17, miR-193b, miR-31, miR-31*, miR-130a, miR-205, miR-21, miR-24-1, miR-24-2, miR-210, miR-29a).",

On the other hand, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) alone induced a fast increase in the expression of 46 miRNAs which peaked at 3 h (including miR-21, miR-25, miR-27b, miR-100, miR-140, miR-142-3p, miR-181c, miR-187, miR-194, miR-214, miR-223, and miR-224), while dexamethasone had no effect on miRNA expression.",

            "text": "MiR-155 is contained within the only phylogenetically conserved region of BIC RNA (45, 46). It has been linked to cancer (47\u201350), viral infection (51), and immunity (52\u201355). MiR-155 has been shown to be induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli such as LPS, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), IL-1, and TNF-\u03b1 in macrophages and dendritic cells (56\u201358), in particular through NF-\u03baB and AP-1 transcription factors (56, 59, 60). It has also been detected in fibroblasts from different origins (61) including lung (62) in which miR-155 was also found to be upregulated by IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 (63) as well as overexpressed in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis (63). Multiple targets for miR-155 have been identified in several cell types and linked with the regulation of B- and T-cell differentiation (53, 54, 64\u201366), TLR signaling in inflammatory cells (58), or cellular adhesion in epithelial malignancies (67). Interestingly, BIC-deficient mice displayed significant remodeling of lung airways with age, associated with increased bronchiolar subepithelial collagen deposition and increased cell mass of sub-bronchiolar myofibroblasts. Recently, Pottier et al. (63) have found that miR-155 targets keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, FGF-7), a paracrine-acting, epithelial mitogen and a central mediator of epithelial\u2013mesenchymal interaction. Overall miR-155 would be involved in the attenuation of the inflammatory signaling pathway (58) and epithelial regeneration (63), making it a potential key player during lung injuries. Bhattacharyya et al. (67a) have shown that miR-155 was also more than 5-fold elevated in CF IB3-1 lung epithelial cells in culture, compared to control IB3-1/S9 cells. They also detected it in CF lung epithelial cells, and in circulating CF neutrophils. They propose that elevated miR-155 could contribute to pro-inflammatory expression of IL-8 in CF lung epithelial cells by lowering SHIP1 expression and activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",

Respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus, induce acute infections of the respiratory tract that lead to clinical pictures going from rhinitis, otitis, bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Respiratory epithelial cells represent the primary targets that initially detect the viruses. Their resistance to infection depends on their capacity to detect and restrict virus replication. From that perspective, degradation of the viral genome appears as an ad hoc mechanism for efficient antiviral defense. The contribution of small non-coding RNA to this mechanism has been well-established in plants and invertebrates (68), but rarely in mammals, where the innate antiviral response is rather mediated by a robust type I interferon (IFN-\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03bb)-mediated response (69, 70). In that case, virus recognition occurs through the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs, usually viral nucleic acids) by pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) (71). Interactions within the cytoplasm or at the host cell surface lead to robust cytokine and chemokine responses, via several distinct pathways of activation (72, 73). Interestingly, Otsuka et al. have reported that a mouse mutant with hypomorphic Dicer1 expression (Dicer1(d/d)) was more prone to infection by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (74). These authors detected that host miR-24 and miR-93 were increasing VSV replication in Dicer1-deficient cells after interfering with viral transcripts, without altering VSV genome-derived siRNA pathways and interferon-mediated antiviral responses. miR-122, on the contrary, was required for hepatitis C proliferation in liver (75).",

They found a large number of differentially expressed miRNAs between infected and non-infected tissues (73 in lungs and 36 in tracheae) (76). Alteration of the expression of several miRNAs in bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) at the onset of infection by SARS-CoV, which causes acute infectious disease associated with pulmonary fibrosis and lung failure, has been described by Mallick et al., who suggest that BASCs correspond to the primary site of infection (77). Such variations may participate in the suppression of SARS-CoV replication, thus favoring successful transmission of the virus.",

A strong link has been established between miRNAs and cancers since the initial report by Calin et al. of frequent deletions of mir-15 and mir-16 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (82). A large number of studies have demonstrated since then that deregulation of miRNAs is often associated with cancer development and progression (83, 84). Indeed, some miRNAs can be defined as bona fide tumor suppressors or oncogenes. miRNA expression appears in various tumors as a more robust method for classifying cancer subtypes than mRNA expression profiles (85). Numerous publications have documented aberrant expression of miRNAs in cancers (83, 86\u201389). Specific reviews about miRNAs and lung cancer can be found elsewhere (90\u201392). Of note, Puiss\u00e9gur et al. (92a) have highlighted the importance of miR-210 and of its transcriptional regulation by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 at late stages of non-small cell lung cancer, and its association with an aberrant mitochondrial phenotype.",

A systematic use of such a technology may help unravel the precise interactions existing in vivo between miRNAs and mRNAs. Azuma-Mukai et al. have used a simpler approach that identifies miRNAs associated with hAgo2 and hAgo3 (138). Proteomic approaches, based on differential labeling of the biological samples, have shown that a single miRNA can repress the production of hundreds of proteins. Surprisingly, this repression appears usually relatively mild (see above) (33, 139). Interestingly, changes in translation efficiencies of targeted mRNAs were highly correlated with changes in the abundance of those RNAs, suggesting a functional link between microRNA-mediated repression of translation and mRNA decay (134).",

Though the focus of this review was limited to microRNAs (miRNA), which constitute a tiny subclass of regulatory non-coding RNAs, many more works will be necessary to unravel the many roles played by non-coding RNAs in biological processes. It remains that miRNAs deserve a special interest due to their already established association with many biological processes and to the already ongoing efforts to transfer them into new useful prognosis markers, therapeutic targets, or targeted drugs.",
