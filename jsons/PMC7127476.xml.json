Serial determinations of biomarkers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, or neutrophil CD64) may be used adjunctively in the diagnosis and management of neonatal infection.\u2022Ampicillin and gentamicin remains the cornerstone of initial antimicrobial regimen for neonatal infections. Third-generation cephalosporins should be used judiciously.\u2022The use of antiviral (acyclovir, ganciclovir, valganciclovir, and oseltamivir) and antifungal agents (fluconazole, amphotericin B, and voriconazole) may reduce mortality and morbidity due to specific viral and fungal disease.\u2022Different strategies, such as group B streptococcal prophylaxis, hand hygiene, immunization and immunoprophylaxis, antimicrobial stewardship, probiotics, and prebiotics, and care bundles may be used in preventing infections in neonates.\n\n",

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Fetus and Newborn7 has published a clinical report extensively discussing clinically relevant challenges: identifying newborns with signs of sepsis with high likelihood of EOS requiring antimicrobial regimen and identifying healthy-appearing newborns with high likelihood of EOS requiring antimicrobial regimen. The committee concluded that, although these guidelines are evidence-based, they may be modified by the clinical judgment of the provider. The primary reason is that the clinical presentation of neonatal infection may be subtle and nonspecific, and may overlap with noninfectious causes.7, 8 Many clinicians empirically start broad spectrum antimicrobial regimen for infants considered at risk for sepsis but antibiotics are occasionally continued despite a negative blood culture. This practice may be detrimental to the infant8 because it increases the risk of invasive fungal infections,9 necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), or death,10, 11 which increases the pressure for selecting multidrug-resistant organisms12 and even the risk of LOS.11\n",

Maternal fever may be the only abnormal finding in chorioamnionitis.\u2022Adequate IAP means maternal treatment with penicillin, ampicillin, or cefazolin at or earlier than 4 hours before delivery.\u2022At least 1 mL of blood may be sufficient for a single blood culture from a peripheral vein. Blood culture from umbilical artery catheter or umbilical vein may be a reliable alternative following aseptic techniques\u2022Screening blood cultures have not been proven of value and are not recommended.\u2022Complete blood count with differential has poor positive predictive value and it is suggested waiting 6 to 12 hours after birth to avoid falsely normal values at birth.\u2022Platelet counts remain low days to weeks after sepsis; thus this cannot be used in following response to treatment.\u2022The sensitivity of C-reactive protein (CRP) improves if done 6 to 12 hours after birth. Bacterial sepsis is unlikely if CRP remains normal.\u2022Lumbar puncture may be indicated in infants whom sepsis is highly suspected, those infants with bacteremia, and in infants who fail to respond to antimicrobial therapy.\u2022Urinary tract infection in newborns is associated with episodes of bacteremia; thus urine culture should not be part of routine sepsis workup.\u2022Microbiologic evaluation using gastric aspirates, tracheal aspirates, or superficial body sites cultures are of limited value and are not routinely recommended for sepsis.\n",
