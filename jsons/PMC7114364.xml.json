The swine industry and associated professionals responded on many fronts with the Veterinary Services (VS) branch of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Service (APHIS) initially engaging in laboratory diagnostics, analytic support, epidemiology expertise, and data management. Multiple investigations and studies were conducted in an attempt to answer questions about the epidemic; at the top of the list were how the virus arrived in the United States and if there was risk of another disease following the same path.",

The study included multiple farms with 25 cases and 18 controls. It was completed by June, 2013 and summarized by Dr. Harry Snelson from AASV at the 2014 World Pork Expo (Snelson, 2014). This was conducted as a collaborative effort between the American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV), National Pork Board (NPB), National Pork Producers Council (NPPC), VS' Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health, VS' Chief Epidemiologist, and the National Center for Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Disease Defense (currently: Institute for Infectious Animal Diseases (IIAD), a DHS Center of Excellence at Texas A&M University). Univariate regression analysis on the probability of being a case (i.e., presence of PED virus RNA plus animals with clinical signs) revealed feed factors that were associated with statistically significant higher odds of having PED. Feed that was custom mixed off-farm, increased number of meal/mash rations fed to nursery or finisher pigs, and whether vitamins and minerals were in the same as opposed to separate premixes increased the odds of PED on a farm between 1.5 and 3.5 times. These variables suggest the potential for contamination of feed where complete feed mixed off-farm is related to an effect where more ration types could mean more chances to get a contaminated batch. Although the case-control study suggested that feed was associated with the outbreak, subsequent investigations and herd histories failed to show a common feed or ingredient among the farms.",

USDA formed an investigative group to research the root cause of the epidemic; that is, to find the initiating cause or causal chain where an intervention could reasonably be implemented. A Root Cause Investigation Group (RCG) was tasked with revisiting the mass of information that had accumulated following the initial outbreak, and to leverage resources and partnerships not readily available to non-federal investigators. The group's objective was to identify the mechanism or most likely mechanisms by which PED reached the United States and infected U.S. pigs. The RCG reviewed literature; evaluated data from research projects; consulted with swine industry and veterinary specialists familiar with the individual outbreaks; collaborated with U.S. Government partners; reviewed reports published on university, industry, and laboratory websites; examined U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data on imported products; evaluated data from prohibited product seizures at U.S. ports; and collated testing data from affected herds. Additionally, the RCG initiated new studies as indicated, analyzed data, and conducted follow-up investigations of early-affected farms, and also reached out to international partners that had experienced outbreaks of novel swine enteric coronavirus diseases.",

The RCG used the conclusions of this report and results of published research studies as a baseline, and followed with an epidemiological approach to narrow the scope and more specifically address the entry of PED virus into the United States. The group applied basic concepts of host, agent, environment, and evaluation of transmission mechanisms to develop scenarios that could explain the epidemic. National epidemic curves and timelines were developed to plot the course of the disease spread. Individual herd data gathered by first-responding veterinarians, and later augmented by revisits by VS officers to farms provided vital information for limiting the number of likely disease introduction mechanisms. Host factors, such as a na\u00efve swine population with an explosive spread of disease, helped to limit the probable time of first introduction. Data from genetic epidemiology, virus survival, and infectious dose studies further narrowed the possibilities. Fig. 1\ndescribes five criteria the RCG considered essential for a scenario to explain PED virus entry to the country.",

There were data limitations in that sample submissions prior to a June 2014 USDA Federal Order were voluntary, but assumed to be reasonably complete. In the initial six weeks following the first identified cases of PED, submissions represented herds, while later data represented laboratory accessions. It is unknown whether the latter data represented individual herds. Univariate regression analysis was conducted on data from an initial case-control study with 25 cases and 18 controls (Snelson, 2014) at USDA's Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health using SAS software (Copyright, SAS Institute Inc.) to determine odds ratios and significance for association of cases with feed related factors. Additionally, Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISUVDL) conducted retrospective testing on specimens with submission reasons of gastrointestinal (G.I.) disease archived between December 2012 and May 2013. The G.I. samples represent highly targeted samples for finding PED in cases across the laboratory's area of service across the Midwestern region of the United States. USDA epidemiologists qualitatively evaluated metadata data from Custom and Border Patrol Import Tracking Database to identify categories of products that could potentially be associated with swine feed and serve as mechanical vectors of SECD virus. The data were then qualitatively risk-analyzed by USDA trade risk specialists based on five criteria. Methods are described in further detail in Entry Assessment for Exotic Viral Pathogens of Swine (USDA-APHIS, 2014). Criteria included:1Likelihood of swine, swine tissues, or fluids contact with raw ingredients.2Likelihood typical processing will not inactivate coronaviruses.3Likelihood of swine, swine tissues, or fluids will have contact with the ingredient post-processing.4Likelihood that virus will survive transport from manufacturer to swine farm.5Likelihood that swine will be exposed to the ingredient.\n",

Between March and September 2015, samples from shipments of organic soybeans originating China were collected at three U.S. Ports of Entry and submitted to South Dakota State University Diagnostic Laboratory for testing for six viruses. The laboratory followed standard diagnostic methodology (http://www.sdstate.edu/vs/adrdl/) for PED virus, Porcine Delta coronavirus (PDCoV), transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), and North American and European type porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses (PRRS).2)During 2012\u20132013 FDA collected and archived samples of pet jerky treats imported from China that had been submitted in association with pet deaths. Methods for extraction and specimen testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were developed and tests conducted for PED virus RNA by Dr. Haile Yancy's group at the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine.3)Stability of PED virus in FIBC material was evaluated using a cell culture model; 1.5\u2033 by 1.5\u2033 pieces of polypropylene tote material were placed in sterile, plastic petri dishes. 1 ml of cell culture adapted PED stock virus diluted in MEM was added to the center of each piece of tote material and allowed to dry overnight at room temperature in a biocontainment hood. Petri dishes were covered and placed in closed containers (30 dishes) at each temperature. After each time-point was reached, replicates for each temperature were removed, rehydrated in 1 ml MEM and titered on confluent Vero-76 cells in 96-well plates. Each titration was conducted in triplicate, resulting in 9 replicates/time-point/temperature variables. At 20 h post-infection, the virus titration plates were fixed in 80% acetone, and then stained with PED virus SD6-29 FITC conjugated monoclonal antibody. Individual foci of PED VIRUS infected cells were counted at appropriate dilutions (generally at the highest virus dilution showing 10\u201330 individual foci/well). Infectious virus titers for each time point and temperature were presented graphically as mean fluorescent focus units (FFU)/ml.4)Testing for evidence of PED virus circulation in feral swine. Detecting PED virus in feral swine samples archived prior to April 2013 would suggest that the initial introduction into the United States was earlier than indicated by reported test data, and that the path of introduction differed significantly than what might be expected in commercial swine. The purpose of retrospective testing of feral swine was to produce evidence to inform the hypothesis that SECD-related virus was circulating in feral swine prior to the initial detection of clinical signs in domestic swine in April 2013. Testing of the samples was conducted with an ELISA test (Whole Virus ELISA for PED virus) recently developed by ISUVDL. Initial performance testing on domestic swine indicated that the diagnostic specificity was 98.5% and the sensitivity was greater than the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) from 2 to 7 weeks post inoculation (diagnostic sensitivity point estimate 99.2%). Serum samples from 368 feral swine were provided from the Wildlife Services Wildlife Disease Program archive for fiscal years 2011\u20132013. The samples were collected opportunistically from various locations in Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Hawaii.\n",

            "text": "PED virus is highly transmissible with an infectious dose that is likely only a few dozen virions (Goyal, 2013, Schumacher et al., 2015). It appears to remain viable longer at cooler temperatures (Verma et al., 2014), and has been shown to spread through various mechanisms including trucks, feed, animals, manure, and other fomites (Lowe et al., 2014, McCluskey, 2014, Snelson, 2014, Verma et al., 2014, Yeske, 2014, Nugent, 2015, Sampedro et al., 2015). Genetic epidemiology investigations identify the closest known relatives of the U.S. outbreak to be viruses associated with the 2010\u20132013 outbreaks in China with the exact date of divergence from a common ancestor unknown (NBACC 2015-unpublished data); (Huang et al., 2013, Stevenson et al., 2013, Chen et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2014a, Wang et al., 2014b). Transpacific transport of products by ocean travel from China and distribution within the United States would likely require three or more weeks and viability of the virus for at least that amount time. This would assume some degree of protection from the environment as well as cool temperatures that might be expected in the spring months of a temperate climate.",

Affected farms used different brands of feed from different source companies. There were no common veterinarians, and the herds were owned by different companies. The age and production types of the pigs were different between cases, as were ration formulations. Most of the farms employed good if not best practices for biosecurity; in several cases, they were farms that had been able to exclude endemic contagious viruses such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). There was no single brand or type of biological or vaccine that was used in the different farms. No farm reported visitors from other countries or suspicious activities that suggested an intentional infection of their pigs. The farms were not associated geographically and were not proximate to research or laboratory facilities. Semen came from different sources, all within the United States. None of the herds that were reported through laboratory testing data in the first month of the outbreak were small herds; i.e., all affected herds were of size greater than 1000 animals. Operations with less than 1000 head compose approximately 80% of all U.S. swine operations (USDA-NASS, 2012), and small farms in general have been shown less likely to have stringent biosecurity practices (USDA-APHIS-VS-CEAH, 2012). Although possible that small farms may use veterinary or diagnostic services and report less frequently than larger commercial farms, smaller farms may not have been affected because of different management practices such as receiving feed in bulk quantities. Of the consultants interviewed, three believed the virus introduction was associated with feed, one thought it unlikely that PED virus would remain viable for the length of time required for transit to the United States in feed, and others believed feed as a possibility but were non-committal as to mechanisms. Other alternatives varied widely between experts.",

The samples were collected opportunistically from various locations in Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Hawaii. Although considerable uncertainty exists in estimating feral pig population numbers, six post-hoc groups of pigs were identified by VS and WS biologists.

It is likely that veterinary consultants and swine industry professionals coming to meetings in the United States, or individuals buying swine breeding stock were in contact with affected pigs before traveling to the United States because of the high prevalence of the disease in China (Feng, 2014). Swine consultants that have worked in China for many years acknowledged the risk, but explained that travel biosecurity measures have been standard and adequate to prevent disease introduction in the past.

Many were ruled as unlikely because investigation data from the earliest detected herds did not support them or were considered less likely because of other data. Evaluation of the entire set of information required a number of assumptions for these scenarios to be feasible. Birds were considered unlikely because none of the herds had exposure to migratory birds, and no evidence has been reported that the current strains of SEC viruses can cross species to infect birds then back to pigs again. Different sources of semen, supplies, and biologicals were reported between the farms, and none of the operations were located proximate to research facilities or laboratories. Although some were fed antibiotic products, others were not. Further, the plant material fillers like rice hulls are very dry and likely not hospitable to virus stability. SDPP was used in some rations but not in others, and is a prohibited import from China. Use of prohibited products was feasible, but unlikely that all of the diverse farms received the same product and none reported using any products likely to contain prohibited material.

The FIBC scenario explains a mechanism for each and is compatible with findings of herd investigations as well as other information gathered with few assumptions. It is plausible that pet treats entered the United States contaminated by PED virus, but unlikely that they infected pigs without a secondary fomite such as the FIBCs and unknown if they were ever fed to pigs. Similarly, organic soybeans could be contaminated with viruses, but they too must have a secondary carrier to achieve the dispersal and exposure parts of the journey to infect pigs. The same conclusion, that a secondary fomite is necessary, exists for almost any of the plausible scenarios that the RCG investigated.",

If the fomite that moved the virus was indeed the FIBC, sanitary management prior to reusing the bags may be an effective mitigation. Further research is necessary to identify appropriate cleaning and disinfection procedures and parameters, but the answer could be as simple as not reusing the bags, or a to-be-determined, protocol of dry heat or disinfection prior to reusing the containers.",
