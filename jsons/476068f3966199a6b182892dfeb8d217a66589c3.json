Recently, van der Zalm et al identified 27 different subtypes among a cohort of 18 children sampled fortnightly during a six-month period [7] . Because a lower sequence threshold was used to identify those viruses, it is likely that the true number of HRV types was underestimated as compared to the higher threshold (96% vs 90%) we applied, which we considered essential when using the highly conserved 5\u2032 UTR region. Recent cohort studies that also used the 5\u2032UTR for HRV typing identified 56 [23] distinct HRV types, including 32 new types [23] , whereas other cohort studies have not conducted detailed typing analyses [24, 25] .

Even when an HRV-C type falls into the HRV-A clade phylogenetically, to date it exists within a distinct space in that clade. Carefully chosen sequence identity thresholds and experience can successfully produce robust genotyping results, as has been shown here and elsewhere in the literature [23, 26, 27, [30] [31] [32] .
