Efforts have been made to reduce the demand for or utilization of these over utilized tests [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The most efficient outcomes have involved the formation of a laboratory utilization committee [2], [6] or a laboratory formulary committee [5] based on the hospital pharmacy and therapeutics committee\u2019s organizational structure. This committee evaluates the clinical value of laboratory tests using an evidence-based review of the appropriate medical literature. This same literature is reviewed by numerous professional specialty medical organizations as well as healthcare insurance carriers to determine what tests or procedures should be performed and reimbursed. The conclusions based on these reviews need to be updated on a regular basis.",

Practical examples of obsolete and inappropriate tests are reviewed as potential metrics to monitor improvement in test utilization. Another useful metric is test utilization by clients in a hospital outreach program which can be used to monitor the impact of new clients on laboratory workload.

In that limited number of genes, 1,254 variants were detected and classified as clinically significant (0), carrier status (1), variants of unknown significance (255), likely benign variants (356) and benign variants (642). The definition of these variants calls and the failure of this technique to detect deletions, insertions, interspersed repeats and tandem repeats (repeats adjacent to each other like triplet repeats [15]) may lead to inappropriate interpretation of the results and expensive follow up clinical and laboratory evaluation. For example, a clinically significant pathogenic variant reported in at least 3 unrelated cases with control data may be found in additional genome studies in other populations [16] to be a benign variant that is also found with a new variant which contains the mutation that leads to the most significant deleterious effect on gene function. The software application for variant significance assignment, like DataGenno [17], will need to be up-to-date with the latest genotype/phenotype associations to prevent false positive findings and inappropriate follow-up testing.",

Comprehensive sequencing of numerous human cancers have revealed driver genes, 2 to 8 such genes per tumor, which alter intracellular signal transduction pathways related to the cells future death or survival and/or genome maintenance [19], [20]. There are at least 10 FDA approved cancer therapies based on the inhibition of these tumor-activated intracellular pathways [19].

This V600E mutation is associated with aggressive clinical course in patients with thyroid papillary microcarcinoma [22]. In one study of a hybrid score composed of one molecular diagnostic (V600E) and 3 histopathologic parameters were used to predict this tumor's clinical course with a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 80% [22].",

Pathogen identification has always relied on visual and biochemical interrogation where the summary of results may point to a specific identification (genus and species) or sometimes to at least the genus level. Visual and biochemical results can sometimes yield variable results meaning in some cases the ID may change depending on the result. The use of MALDI-TOF allows the clinical microbiology laboratory to identify bacteria once an isolate has been cultured potentially without performing any biochemical testing [11], [27], [28]. The implications are quicker pathogen identifications to clinicians and the potential to affect antibiotic treatment before susceptibility results are available. The ability to obtain a quicker answer will disrupt the testing workflow and require a re-evaluation of that workflow to optimize the use of MALDI-TOF and antibiotic susceptibility testing [11], [27], [28].",

[37] reviewed the national annual savings if outpatient visits to the primary care physicians did not include unnecessary or inappropriate laboratory tests including CBC ($32.7 million), urinalysis ($3.3 million) and basic metabolic panel ($10.1 million). Those three procedures yield an annual cost savings of $46.1 million compared to the elimination of inappropriate Pap tests at an annual savings of $47.8 million. These figures illustrate the magnitude of healthcare savings by implementing simple laboratory test ordering practices which reduce duplication and/or inappropriate testing. Collaboration by subspecialty medical societies in disruptive technology development and improvements in routine clinical laboratory test utilization will be a fertile area for the development of benchmarks and metrics for future laboratory test utilization.",

Standardization of free T4 assays has been reported using the time-consuming equilibrium dialysis in combination with isotope dilution-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry [43]. T3 Uptake is an assessment of unsaturated (unbound to thyroxine) thyroid binding proteins in serum and is used with total T4 to calculate FTI. The FTI is obtained by multiplying the (Total T4) times (T3 Update). There is no longer a need to estimate free T4 when there are assays for the direct measurement of free T4 in every laboratory. Supporting evidence for the obsolescence of T3 Update and FTI has been available for decades [44].

The test was designed to assess platelet function or exclude von Willebrand Disease. This test is labor intensive, invasive, poorly reproducible, and insensitive [36]. Historically it was performed because screening tests with a higher sensitivity for platelet dysfunction and von Willebrand disease (vWD) were unavailable. Bleeding time has been replaced by instrumentation that can assess platelet function in whole blood by aggregation studies [47], [48]. Available instrumentation includes the PFA-10 (Platelet Function Analyzer, Siemens USA), the VerifyNow (Accumetrics), the Plateletworks (Helena), the IMPACT (Diamed) and the thromboelastograph (TEG) (Haemonetics). Initial tests for a bleeding disorder rule out more common causes of bleeding. These tests include complete blood and platelet counts, PTT, PT, and possibly fibrinogen level or thrombin time.

Overall, the sensitivity is essentially the same as that of a Gram-stained smear of a cyto-centrifuged CSF specimen [49], [50]. With the advent of vaccines to H. influenza type b and N. meningitides (A, C, Y, and W-135) the antigen testing is even less useful.

However, the WB is moving its way into obsolescence as newer generation antigen/antibody and molecular assays become part of the new HIV testing algorithms. HIV-1 WBs have always had issues with indeterminate results due to a myriad of factors (false positives and/or lack of specificity, kit design, etc.), which required either re-testing at a later time and/or molecular testing for HIV-1 nucleic acid [53]. The CDC/APHL, WHO, and France each have different interpretation criteria for defining a positive confirmatory result which indicates a lack of standardization for defining a patient as positive for HIV-1 [54]. The immune response to HIV-2 is well known to produce antibodies that cross react on the HIV-1 WB which could lead to a false positive HIV-1 result [54]. The lack of improvements or advancements of the WB compared to other antibody based assays has been nicely shown by Masciotra et al. [55]. They demonstrate that the rapid HIV tests actually detect HIV-1 antibodies several days earlier before the WB becomes positive [55]. The introduction of 4th generation antigen/antibody testing has allowed clinicians to detect reactive patients earlier in their disease course compared to 3rd generation testing effectively narrowing the window of serological detection by approximately 4\u20138 days [56]. Because of these new developments, CLSI and APHL have recommended new algorithms that incorporate antigen/antibody combination tests, rapid tests, and molecular testing [57], [58]. The WB should be a test that will be obsolete as laboratories adopt the newer algorithms for HIV testing.",

Not only are results obtained sooner than traditional virology testing, but our molecular RVP offers greater sensitivity and specificity than our prior Direct Fluorescence Assay (DFA) that was sent out to a reference laboratory. Because of the increased sensitivity, the RVPs have allowed us to document co-viral infections, which have not been fully appreciated before with DFA or culture based testing [64]. There have been reports of increased severity of disease, as well as reports of decreased severity of disease in the setting of co-viral infections [65]. Much more research must be done to understand the potential interactions of different respiratory viruses in the setting of a respiratory infection. Our laboratory publishes a \u201cVirogram\u201d during the respiratory virus season and related viral coinfections (Fig. 1, Fig. 2\nand Table 1\n).
