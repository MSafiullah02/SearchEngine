            "text": "In the 21st century, rabies remains as one of the most feared and important threats to public health. The untreated disease presents as a progressive encephalomyelitis, which is invariably fatal, and is caused by neurotropic viruses of the genus lyssavirus. As a neglected zoonotic disease, rabies is present throughout much of the world (figure 1\n), with many deaths in human beings occurring in Africa and Asia in children younger than 15 years. Rabies is regarded as under-reported in many regions,1 due in part to a lack of surveillance and laboratory infrastructure, confounded by cultural or social taboos.2, 3, 4 The absence of accurate data on disease incidence in turn tends to reduce rabies as a priority for policy makers and public health professionals.5, 6 Estimates of the global burden, based on models of incidence of dog bites, have been updated and augmented to include country-specific data from published studies and online surveys, giving a more comprehensive global estimate.7 Preliminary data suggest that almost 60 000 human deaths occur from rabies globally per year, which is more than that attributed to any other single zoonotic disease (table 1\n).8, 9 The large number of children among these fatalities means that rabies is estimated to cause more than 2 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost per year, with an annual economic cost of more than US$4 billion per year.7 Other models have used estimates of values of statistical life to predict the economic impact of rabies. These values range from $1\u00b78 to $2\u00b72 million per human death\u2014a value that does not take into account post-exposure treatments, livestock losses, and costs associated with diagnostic testing and vaccination.10 The total annual global costs of canine rabies alone are estimated to be of the order of tens of billions of dollars.10\n",

Hence controlling rabies in dogs, and especially free-roaming (stray) dogs, is the first priority for prevention of human rabies.11, 12, 13 The disease causes a severe and long-lasting societal and economic burden and the implications are especially apparent in poverty-stricken developing countries. Shortage of resources and a limited public health infrastructure in many rabies-endemic countries precludes data collection and analysis. Rabies has been successfully controlled in dog populations throughout the Americas, and rabies in both dog and terrestrial wildlife populations has been successfully eliminated from western Europe. Thus, rabies can be controlled with sufficient resources. Alongside the burden of rabies in terrestrial animals, many novel lyssaviruses causing clinically indistinguishable disease have been detected. Most virus species identified have been detected in bats, and include species that are antigenically distinct from current vaccine strains.",

            "text": "Once infection is established within neuronal cells the virus usurps host cell machinery to reach cell bodies in the spinal cord or brainstem or in sensory ganglia (eg, dorsal root ganglia) where replication occurs. The motility of RABV along neuronal processes has been exploited to map neuronal circuitry.48, 49 The virus is transported by fast axonal transport through the spinal cord to the brain. Until this stage the patient shows no clinical signs. Host detection of virus intracellularly occurs through the retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 pathway50 through the detection of cap structures on the virus mRNAs and through Toll-like receptors.51 This detection stimulates an early interferon response that is antagonised by the virus phosphoprotein.52, 53 The mechanism of interferon antagonism seems to be conserved between many of the lyssaviruses.54, 55 Once in the CNS, the virus replicates extensively and clinical disease develops. Notably, fatal encephalitic rabies might not necessarily be accompanied by substantial inflammation and this feature could, in part, be due to the genetics of the infecting virus. This variability in inflammatory response is also seen in cases of dog rabies. Furthermore, neuronophagia can vary substantially and neuronal apoptosis does not seem to have an important role in rabies encephalitis in human beings.56 Nonetheless, extensive infection of the brain leads to centrifugal dissemination of virus through neurons to distant sites throughout the body. Of particular importance in reservoir species is the spread of the virus to peripheral sites that release the virus into the oral cavity via the salivary glands. Rabies virus antigen staining of the taste buds has also been observed.57, 58, 59 The salivary glands are innervated from the parasympathetic nervous system via the submandibular ganglion and glossopharyngeal nerves, by sympathetic innervation via the superior cervical ganglion, and by afferent innervation.60, 61 Ultrastructural studies suggested that the virus is able to travel from the brain to peripheral sites by budding on synaptic or adjacent plasma membranes of dendrites with budding also occurring, albeit less often, from the plasma membrane of the perikaryon.62 Detection of virus particles engulfed by an invaginated membrane of an adjacent axonal terminus suggested transneuronal dendroaxonal movement. However, alongside this finding, virus has also been reported to bud directly into the intercellular space, which along with hypersalivation and the aggressive behaviour often associated with infection, promotes onward transmission of the virus to new hosts (figure 3).",

Experimental studies show strong evidence for upregulation of interferons, cytokines, and chemokines in the CNS in response to infection with rabies virus.63, 64 Transcriptomic studies have shown the upregulation of many interferon-inducible genes65, 66 and this upregulation has been supported by immunohistological demonstration of chemokine production in neurons. Such production drives an influx of immune cells into the CNS, particularly T cells. However, in the case of rabies virus infection, this influx does not control infection and the host invariably dies. In the absence of therapeutic options no mechanisms exist to ameliorate rabies virus replication once the virus reaches the brain. Evidence for an immune response is not detected until the virus has entered the CNS64, 67 (figure 4\n). How the virus avoids immune surveillance in the periphery is unknown, but might be attributable to the low level of replication early in the infection or activation of immune suppression in the periphery.55, 68\n",

The earliest neurological symptom in human beings is usually pain, paraesthesia, or pruritus at the site of infection because of viral replication in local dorsal root ganglia and associated ganglionitis.69 After the prodrome, either the encephalitic or paralytic forms of the disease might be observed. Encephalitic rabies often presents with hypersalivation, and periods of agitation alternating with lucidity will be observed\u2014a key feature of the so-called \u201cfurious\u201d type of rabies. Importantly, patients with hypersalivation have difficulty swallowing the excessive saliva produced (video 1). RABV nucleic acid might be detected in saliva samples taken at this stage. Hydrophobia is also often observed, and in developing countries water might be offered to suspected patients for diagnostic purposes (video 2). As hydrophobia progresses, the offer of water leads to pharyngeal spasms and involuntarily refusal of the water with excessive gagging being noted (video 3). Infection invariably leads to coma and death. The paralytic form of disease differs from the encephalitic form in that muscle weakness develops early (which is not observed in the so-called furious form of the disease), and progression to coma and death often takes longer than with the encephalitic form.69\n",

A palliative approach should include liberal use of sedatives and analgesics as needed to achieve comfort. Unfortunately, no effective therapy exists for rabies after the development of clinical disease. Clinical management of rabies has included a combination of therapies, rabies vaccine, immunotherapies, and ketamine.93 Ten people have survived rabies, including one who received pre-exposure immunisation and eight who received one or more doses of post-exposure prophylaxis before the onset of rabies; all but one of these individuals had neurological deficits and two died within a few years.94, 95 One individual who survived without post-exposure prophylaxis did so after the administration of an aggressive combination of medical treatments including the induction of a therapeutic coma, combined with ribavirin, ketamine, and amantadine treatment.96 This approach, dubbed the Milwaukee protocol, gave initial promise as a novel treatment to combat clinical rabies.97 However, attempts to repeat this first success have failed in at least 26 subsequent cases, suggesting that the protocol is ineffective.98\n",

There are several factors that should be regarded as favourable in the decision to initiate an aggressive therapeutic approach: therapy with doses of rabies vaccine before the onset of illness, young age, previously healthy and immunocompetent individual, mild neurological disease at the time of initiation of therapy, rabies due to a New World bat rabies variant (eg, by contrast with a canine variant or Old World bat variant), and the early detection of neutralising antirabies virus antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid.98 An effective therapy for rabies is unlikely to be developed in the future with a trial and error approach, especially because numerous neuroprotective drug studies have failed to show efficacy for any one drug.99 To develop a therapy for rabies a much better understanding of basic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disease is needed.61, 69, 98 Such knowledge might help in the development of an effective therapeutic intervention. Cooling of the brain (hypothermia) has also been considered a potential therapy.98\n",

In the 1940s, these nerve tissue vaccines were replaced with more immunogenic and safer cell-culture-derived vaccines (CCVs).100 Despite official recommendations to discontinue use of nerve tissue vaccines some countries still produce and administer these vaccines. For CCVs, clinical trials have enabled a reduction in the numbers of doses administered, in turn increasing patient compliance with the treatment, as well as enabling alternative routes of administration to be adopted.100 WHO and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommend a single pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimen (table 2\n). PrEP is also strongly recommended for travellers to endemic countries,101 and, because of waning antibody titres after PrEP, pre-exposure booster vaccine doses are also recommended. Booster vaccinations need to be administered in accordance with the vaccine manufacturer's recommendations.102 Pre-exposure vaccination is given as a three-dose schedule of intramuscular or intradermal injections on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28, where day 0 is the day of the first dose.103 For individuals at risk of exposure, booster doses could be administered dependent on individual maintenance of neutralising antibody titres, and the relative risk.100 Often, travellers fail to obtain PrEP because they do not understand the level of risk of rabies at their destination.102\n",

Prominent among these new prototype vaccines that may be licensed in the future for treating rabies is the so-called TriGAS construct that contains three copies of the glycoprotein gene.118 Overexpression of the glycoprotein gene by this construct stimulates a strong immune response and simultaneously seems to attenuate the infection.119 In the near future, such viruses will probably gain acceptance in veterinary vaccination. Oral vaccination with attenuated strains is commonplace in Europe although often, the cause of attenuation has not been deduced, and as such reversion to virulence is a concern. Molecular manipulation of vaccine strains with reverse genetics enables the mechanisms of attenuation to be investigated, which can then be applied to safely attenuate RABV, preventing possible reversion to virulence.120\n",

            "text": "A high proportion of cases of rabies involve childhood fatalities, and therefore rabies should be considered an important paediatric disease.121 The combination of an existing rabies human vaccine with a standard childhood vaccine regimen should be a priority to ensure global vaccination against rabies of children living in low-income countries. This strategy would involve the incorporation of rabies vaccination into the existing childhood Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) schedule.103 The addition of rabies vaccine into an existing multivalent paediatric vaccine as part of a childhood EPI schedule should ideally include a single-dose vaccine, preferably by a non-injectable route of administration.122 Unlike other viruses targeted for elimination, rabies will never be eradicated because of the presence of lyssaviruses in bats.26, 123 The realistic aim in the 21st century is to enhance efforts towards the elimination of rabies in dogs with the resultant reduction of human mortality,2, 11 a goal that has already been achieved in several regions.124, 125, 126, 127 The strategic approach for programmes aimed at the elimination of canine rabies should focus on a multidisciplinary core of disparate groups, including representatives from public and private sectors (ie, vaccine manufacturers, policy makers, scientists, veterinarians, and clinicians) with the overall vision of elimination of human rabies.128 This collaborative multidisciplinary initiative, often termed the One Health approach, is a step towards combating rabies through the mass vaccination of dogs and humane management of dog populations.129 Financial support for these initiatives will be needed. Such programmes are at present paid for by charitable foundations, sponsors, and financial donors working in partnership with global institutions.10 Alongside these measures the OIE have developed an animal vaccine repository that it uses to supply various regions with vaccine.126, 130, 131 The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has proposed a Progressive Control Pathway towards rabies elimination, with the final stage of the pathway being the maintenance of a freedom from rabies in humans and animals. This support should transgress community, district, national, and international levels. The development of novel diagnostic techniques for both ante-mortem and post-mortem diagnostic confirmation in endemic regions is essential to enable epidemiological assessment and assess treatment options when possible.2, 90 The pathway required by the veterinary services for the control of rabies in dogs was proposed by the OIE to sustainably improve the compliance of veterinary services. Its key components are performance, vision, and strategy.131 With this in mind WHO, OIE, and the Food and Agricultural Organisation have proposed a strategy for the elimination of human rabies transmitted by dogs in rabies-endemic countries; recommending this should be a realistic goal by 2030.",
