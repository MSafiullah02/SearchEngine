            "text": "A feature common to all RNA viruses is their high genetic variability due to high mutation rates of around 10\u22124\u201310\u22125 misincorporations per nucleotide per replication cycle (Drake and Holland, 1999), facilitated by the lack of proof-reading activity. This high genetic variability has been associated, among other things, with the concept of quasispecies for the last two decades (Eigen, 1993, Eigen and McCaskill, 1988). The quasispecies approach is based on the concept of quasi-infinite error-prone populations displaying a high mutation rate (Lauring and Andino, 2010, Wilke, 2005). In this situation a virus will generate a large progeny with genomes highly similar to the parental molecule, each one differing from this original genome by one or few mutated sites. Other rounds of replication will generate additional variants also bearing limited mutations which with time will occupy the \u201csequence space\u201d, a geometrical representation of all possible sequences. The outcome is a \u201ccloud\u201d of variants behaving almost (quasi) as a unique entity (species), or quasispecies (Lauring and Andino, 2010, Wilke, 2005). However, this is the outcome in the mathematical modeling of the growth of a quasi-infinite population. In a true biological context, this dynamics will be strongly counterbalanced by negative, purifying, selection to generate smaller clouds of closely related sequences, each one differing from the master sequences by very few mutations. Quasispecies theory is therefore a specific case of population genetics and mutation-selection concept in which a strong negative selection generates a group of closely related sequences described as \u201ccoupled\u201d in the sequence space (Wilke, 2005). Several studies have investigated the applicability of this model to various RNA viruses, mostly to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Border\u00eda et al., 2010, Briones et al., 2006, Briones et al., 2003), foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (Domingo et al., 2002, Ojosnegros et al., 2010), and hepatitis viruses (Domingo and Gomez, 2007, Figlerowicz et al., 2010, Fishman and Branch, 2009, Sulbaran et al., 2010). The quasispecies structure of influenza virus was also investigated through different approaches such as PCR amplicons (Chen et al., 2010, Kongchanagul et al., 2008, Iqbal et al., 2009, Watanabe et al., 2011), next generation sequencing (Kuroda et al., 2010, Ramakrishnan et al., 2009, H\u00f6per et al., 2009, H\u00f6per et al., 2011), realtime RT-PCR (Van Borm et al., 2010) and pyrosequencing (Lackenby et al., 2008, Duwe and Schweiger, 2008). Other studies were conducted on viruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Seligman, 2007), flaviviruses (Brackney et al., 2010, Jerzak et al., 2005) and plant viruses (Hasi\u00f3w-Jaroszewska et al., 2010).",

Its segmented RNA genome allows it to evolve rapidly via mutation, reassortment, recombination and mixed infection. The consequences of this high genetic variability are numerous: resistance to drugs, modification of virulence, antigenic drift, escape from the immune response, ability to adapt to new host species, etc. Given the animal health and public health hazard that the HPAI H5N1 virus presents, these features have been investigated and documented for over 10 years. Nonetheless, nothing is known about their behavior as defined in the quasispecies framework. Furthermore, the HPAI H5N1 virus being responsible for acute fatal infections, as opposed to chronic infections caused by most viruses previously studied in the quasispecies model, data obtained from the latter do not necessarily apply to the HPAI H5N1 virus.",

Owing to the low number of mutations observed, there was no saturation and each variation corresponded to a mutation. However, the mutation matrix was not symmetrical and was strongly biased towards the presence of A > G (259/556) and T > C (190/556) mutations which represented 81% of all mutations observed (Table 2\n). This bias was observed in all organs as well as in the inoculum (data not shown). Despite this strong mutational bias towards G and C, the average G + C content of sequences analyzed was 44%. These two classes of mutations were complementary, suggesting that only one class of mutation actually occurred but both on the genome and anti-genome. Such strongly biased A > G mutational patterns cannot be explained by RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) misincorporations but are usually associated with Adenosine Deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) (Bass, 2002). However, the landmark of ADAR1 mutation is 5\u2032 neighbor position preference (usually U = A > C > G) (Bass, 2002), a feature which was not observed here with the exception of 3 data out of 16 (data not shown), suggesting that the activity observed might be an ADAR1-related deamination process rather than strict ADAR1. Therefore, three different mutation frequencies were calculated (Table 1). The first one was simply the overall mutation frequency: f\ntot\n = (number of mutations)/(number of nucleotides) = #mutations/#nt = 1.58 \u00d7 10\u22123 mutations/site. The second one tried to estimate the fraction of mutations due to the deamination process solely. We assumed that (i) deamination only produced A > G and T > C mutations; (ii) the total number of observed A > G + T > C mutations was the sum of mutations due to deamination on one hand and to RdRP misincorporations on the other hand, and (iii) the mutation matrix of RdRP misincorporations was symmetrical, i.e. that the actual number of A > G + T > C due to RdRP equalled the observed number of G > A + C > T transitions. Therefore the mutation frequency due to the deamination process solely was: fdeam = (A > G + T > C\u2212G > A\u2212C > T)/(A + T) = 1.88 \u00d7 10\u22123 mutations/A-or-T-sites. Finally we estimated the mutation frequency due to RdRP solely by substracting the deamination component from A > G and T > C, using the same assumption as before: fpol = (#mutation\u2212A > G\u2212T > C + G > A + C > T)/#nt = 5.19 \u00d7 10\u22124 mutations/nt. This corrected mutation frequency was similar to the values ranging from 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 mutations/nt reported by Iqbal et al. for H5N1 virus in chickens and in very similar experimental conditions (Iqbal et al., 2009).",

The comparison of the observed mutations per locus for all sets fitted quite well with a Poisson distribution. Few variations from Poisson distribution were observed, most of them occurring on PB2a. With the exception of PB2 there was no significant difference between loci with respect to the number of mutations. Similarly, there was no significant difference between organs nor between organs and inoculum. This suggested that these mutations were purely stochastic and therefore not fixed by selective pressure. This was also supported by two observations: (i) the distribution of the number of mutations was uniform across the three reading frames (Supplementary Table S6), whereas one would expect more mutations on the third frame if selective fixation had occurred; (ii) in the same way, the observed ratio of non-synonymous over synonymous mutations was 367/189 = 1.94, a value very close to the expected ratio of 2 for purely random mutations (the actual expected value for random mutations on these particular sequences was 2.09).

Although some few variations were observed, the distribution per site displayed a good fit with the Poisson distribution supporting further the stochastic occurrence of the mutations and the absence of fixation with time.

However, this work is based on the use of amplicons in order to cover a large portion of the viral genome. A limitation is thus that only a small proportion of the overall population of variants was analyzed. This work should therefore be completed by an in-depth high-throughput approach which allows deeper coverage of the whole population.",

Although the mean death time of chickens was short (2 days), the average duration of the replication cycle of the influenza A virus being of 5\u20136 h (Baccam et al., 2006, Zambon and Potter, 2009), it allowed at least 6\u20138 cycles to be accomplished during the span time of the experiment. This makes the experimental data reported in this work comparable to what would be expected in a situation of quasispecies evolution. The quasispecies nature of influenza has been investigated on a variety of serotypes, including the pandemic 2009 influenzaA virus H1N1 but also H3N1 and H5N1. These investigations were performed by using a wide range of complementary approaches including in depth next generation sequencing (Kuroda et al., 2010, Ramakrishnan et al., 2009, H\u00f6per et al., 2009, H\u00f6per et al., 2011), pyrosequencing (Lackenby et al., 2008, Duwe and Schweiger, 2008), realtime RT-PCR (Van Borm et al., 2010) and PCR amplicons sequencing (Chen et al., 2010, Kongchanagul et al., 2008, Iqbal et al., 2009, Watanabe et al., 2011). This work relates to this last approach.",

Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis of the different loci on a per-organ basis yielded trees with similar unresolved topologies, i.e. non-structured or star-shaped trees, indicative of parallel and independent evolution of each clone from the same original master sequence (Biebricher and Eigen, 2006, Lauring and Andino, 2010). The data reported in this work indicate that the number of observed mutations is of the order of one mutation per clone, corresponding to an overall mutation frequency of 1.58 \u00d7 10\u22123 mutations/site. Owing to a total genome size of \u223c13.5 kb, this would lead to an overall mutation frequency of 21.3 mutations/genome. This value might be too high to be compatible with the creation of viable variants (Crotty et al., 2001). However, the purely replicative part of the mutations was calculated to be about 5.19 \u00d7 10\u22124 mutations/site which would lead to a genomic frequency of 7.0 mutations/genome. Although this value is still rather high, it would lead to a fraction of e\u22127.0\n \u223c 1 \u2030 of genomes displaying no mutation and 3% of genomes with at most 2 mutations (Table 3) during the life time of infected chickens. This indicates that the mutation frequency attributable to RdRp is compatible with the survival of viable viruses in the population. Furthermore, both the overall mutations and the restricted mutations follow a random (Poisson) process with no shared mutations or specific patterns.",

            "text": "The main proportion of the observed mutations is attributable to a host-driven deamination process. HPAI H5N1 virus displayed a very strong A > G mutational bias. 81% of the observed mutations were A to G and T to C transitions whereas reverse G to A and C to T transitions as well as transversions were more limited (13.6%). A very similar bias was recently reported on SRAS, although to a lower extent with A > G and T > C substitutions making about 60% of all mutations observed (Eckerle et al., 2010). This bias was never reported for in vitro activity of AMV reverse transcriptase despite extensive misincorporation survey (Operario et al., 2005, Skinner and Eperon, 1986, Taube et al., 1998). This strong mutational bias is suggestive of the activity of a family of host cell proteins known as Adenosine Deaminases that Act on RNA or ADAR (Bass, 2002). ADAR-mediated RNA editing occurs through the conversion of adenosine to inosine in both coding and noncoding regions of double-stranded RNA. This finally leads to the editing into guanosine. The presence of T to C transitions on the sequence may correspond in fact to A to G mutations on the complementary strand indicating thus that 81% of the observed mutations would be ADAR-like mediated RNA editing. However, ADAR editing is dependent on two factors, the first one being specificity which is directly dependent on the stability of the double-stranded RNA (Bass, 2002). ADAR editing usually occurs on a limited number of adenosine residues but can extend up to 50% under some situations of high stability of the double-stranded RNA editing, a process known as hypermutation (Bass, 2002, Susp\u00e8ne et al., 2011). In this work, the overall editing is only 0.2 \u2030 of all adenosines available and an average of two residues per sequence. The second main trait of ADAR is the neighbor position preference. ADAR-mediated editing displays a slight preference for certain adenosines over others depending upon their immediate neighbor base. ADAR1 displays no 3\u2032 preference but a clear 5\u2032 preference where U \u223c A > C = G (Bass, 2002, Susp\u00e8ne et al., 2011). If the data reported here underline the overwhelming presence of A > G editing among the HPAI H5N1 virus variants isolated from chicken, this does not correspond to true ADAR1 activity owing to the lack of neighbor preference and should be referred to as ADAR1-like deamination. However, the inoculum, which was coming from egg passage, displayed the same bias indicating thus that this ADAR1-like process is also active in hen eggs. The data reported in this work most likely result from the superposition of two mechanisms: the RdRP intrinsic errors during the replication of the virus on one hand and an antiviral ADAR-like activity from the host on the other hand.",

This is in particular true for influenza A. ADAR1-depleted mice were more susceptible to influenza virus (Ngamurulert et al., 2009) while ADAR1 proteins were produced in higher amounts in influenzaA infected cells (Emmott et al., 2010). Furthermore, H5N1 NS1 protein was reported to specifically interact with ADAR1 proteins, to inhibit interferon production and to manipulate host proteins to facilitate infection and confer an unusual severity (Ngamurulert et al., 2009, Randall and Goodbourn, 2008, Samuel, 2011). Antiviral ADAR1 activity seems to be based at least on two complementary actions: interferon activity and accumulation of deleterious mutations in virus protein genes. This brings the mutation frequency to a level which might be too high to maintain viral genome infectivity (1 for 10 million) pushing thus viral population towards a model of \u201cerror catastrophe\u201d (Crotty et al., 2001).",

            "text": "Despite the presence of an ADAR1-like antiviral response and an overall mutation frequency beyond the viability limit, the H5N1 virus studied in this work was able to infect the chickens and kill them within two days. This demonstrates its high virulence in a susceptible host but also its ability to efficiently counteract the host innate immunity. The answer might be found in some additional key concepts in the quasispecies theory. The first one is mutational robustness (Van Nimwegen et al., 1999), in which a population minimizes the detrimental impact of mutations by gathering sequences with low probability of bearing deleterious mutations (Bornberg-Bauer and Chan, 1999, Lauring and Andino, 2010, Van Nimwegen et al., 1999, Wilke, 2001, Wilke and Adami, 2003). The second concept to consider is that of functional cooperation (Lauring and Andino, 2010, M\u00e1s et al., 2010) in which a global advantage is given, here pathogenicity versus host defense, to the cloud of variants by the association of complementary functions borne by separate variants. Although intuitively sound and in line with the reality, which is that the virus was successful in evading host defenses and kill the chickens, this is difficult to demonstrate and must thus remain at a somehow speculative level. This is nevertheless an expected outcome of the quasispecies concept. Unlike Darwinian evolution which relies on the preexistence in the population of rare but suitable mutations which can be fixed by selection, and thus can be traced, there is no such preexisting fixed mutation in quasispecies. There is instead a continuous stochastic occurrence of mutations in the overall population and the cooperation of a limited number of variants to provide a temporary functional advantage in a given situation (e.g. circumventing host defense, adapting to a new host, etc.). These mutations are temporary but through cooperation and mutational robustness they may confer a functional advantage in a novel environment or host. The occurrence of such \u201cpreferred\u201d sites was recently reported in a comparative analysis of H5N1 virus mutation frequency in different hosts (Iqbal et al., 2009). In the work presented here, several of the mutated sites observed were previously described in the literature as bearing mutations of special functional importance (Table 4\n). These regions fell roughly into two categories: those involved in adaptation to human host, and those involved in virulence and pathogenicity. Many substitutions were observed on well-known sites in the hemagglutinin protein, such as antigenic sites, receptor-binding sites, the cleavage site, or the fusion peptide. Substitution of the glutamine for an arginine on position 192 in the H5 HA1 protein was shown to be responsible for the shift from sialic acid \u03b12,3 galactose (SA\u03b12,3Gal) to SA\u03b12,6Gal recognition (Yamada et al., 2006) and thus adaptation to human hosts (Matrosovich et al., 1999, Matrosovich et al., 1997). Mutations described as potentially affecting membrane fusion (Chen et al., 1999, Langley et al., 2009, Skehel and Wiley, 2000) were also detected in the HA2 protein. The three substitutions observed on relevant sites of the NA protein were located on amino acids involved in the neuraminidase active site (Collins et al., 2008, Russell et al., 2006, Yen et al., 2005, Yen et al., 2007). As for the NS protein, the main element to report was the mutation Asp92Gly. Better known at this position is the Asp92Glu substitution, responsible for increased virulence and resistance to antiviral cytokines (Seo et al., 2002, Zhou et al., 2010). Position 92 is also located within the translation initiation factor eIF4GI binding domain (positions 81\u2013113) of NS1. Truncations of this domain were shown to have an impact on virulence and pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses (Zhou et al., 2010). It would be out of scope to speculate on a possible effect but their occurrence on the limited number of clones analyzed in this work out of the numerous possibilities offered by the sequence space make them worth to be at least mentioned.",
