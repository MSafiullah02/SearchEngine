This group initiated a split-team policy with complete separation to protect personnel and to maintain clinical capability. The group also created capacity in the form of space, equipment, and personnel by limiting operations and appointments. With these steps, the group has increased the availability of intensive care beds, ventilators, personal protective equipment, and providers. Ng and colleagues are also maximizing the use of telemedicine and remote triage while maintaining a high standard of care.",

During 4 days in March, this group obtained responses from dozens of vascular teams around the world, showing that 90% of practices have canceled some if not all elective operations, and a similar 90% have canceled staff meetings or converted to online video or text messaging platforms. Similar to the military's having learned from international partners during the recent wars, vascular surgery's response to the pandemic confirms that medicine is an international language and we do not have to learn alone. To optimize our effectiveness in this pandemic, we must put to use strong international partnerships in vascular surgery.",

By maximizing telecommunication and devising a split-shift call schedule that separates the vascular teams, they have optimized the well-being of the staff and their ability to continue the mission should a member become ill or quarantined. The vascular groups in Singapore, Milan, and Seattle have also served as trusted leaders within their respective health care systems, supporting plans for surges of exposed or ill patients and helping to make difficult decisions relating to resource allocation.",

Using a similar format, the military has used weekly worldwide virtual town halls for more than a decade as a performance improvement mechanism. These weekly meetings allow the military's trauma system to gather real-time information from its clinical community, to discuss what is working and what is not working, to make adjustments in practice guidelines, and to find ways for the system to support those on the ground.",

Most mass casualty events occur without notice, providing little time for the health care system to respond. As such, the most important factor in optimizing team performance and patient survival is to do systemwide planning ahead of time. In our experience, no mass casualty triage scenario ever goes perfectly, and they are always chaotic. However, implementing lessons from those who have been through similar events goes a long way to improving success when health care providers are faced with such a daunting task. Unlike most mass casualty events, this pandemic has provided a short lead time for many providers and health care systems not yet affected to prepare. The time to act is now.",

In the case of the 2020 pandemic, we should use the tools we have developed to adapt and to lead in the whole-of-medicine response to the virus. The good news is that we do not have to learn or lead this alone.
