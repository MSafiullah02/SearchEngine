However, false negative in nucleic acid detection has been reported, and the clinical symptoms may be atypical that may cause misdiagnosis and make the situation spread. Therefore, the imaging examination becomes particularly important. In this study, the CT images of 130 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia were collected and their imaging features were analyzed. The NCP was classified for the first time according to its distribution characteristics and the CT signs were further interpreted from the perspectives of anatomy, pathophysiology, and immunity, in order to improve the radiologists' familiarity with the disease and help make the early diagnosis and show insights in the development of disease on follow-up CT.",

All the patients underwent thin-slice CT scan. All CT examinations were performed with a 128-section scanner (Siemens, GE, Neusoft) without injecting contrast media. All thin-slice CT images were uploaded through the network and reviewed by three chest radiologists (J.W., J.P., and D.T.) with approximately 5 to 30 years of experience in chest imaging. In cases of discrepant assessment results between the radiologists, images were reviewed independently, and a consensus was established. When radiologists disagreed about a sign, a consensus meeting online was held. The radiation dose for CT scan is 120 kV/ 30 mA/142 mAs/454.7 mGy\u00b7cm.",

The virus mainly invades lung interstitium, conforming to the previous literature [11] .

The NCP mainly invades the bronchioles and distal lung tissue, causing inflammatory lesions mainly in the interstitium; thus, the distribution is mainly in the peripheral subpleural region, which is also one of the most common distribution patterns. 3) Diffuse distribution: the lobular distribution and subpleural distribution can overlap.

Its formation mechanism may be as follows: When the virus mainly invades the interlobular interstitium, especially the perialveolar interstitium, this part of lymph drainage direction is subpleural and interlobular septum. The lesion will spread to the pleural side and bilateral interlobular septum. Since the distal end is limited by the pleura, the lesion can only cling to the pleura, spread along the reticular structure of the interlobular septum, and diffuse to the periphery. The fusion with subpleural lesions leads to the long axis of the lesions parallel to the pleura. The \"parallel pleura sign\" is very characteristic in NCP but is not specific; it can be present in other interstitial lung diseases such as influenza pneumonia.",

We hypothesize that the development of the GGO into consolidation may be due to secondary alveolar pulmonary edema, and tissue organization, and partly combined with bacterial infection. In addition, the absorption of GGO, consolidation, edge contraction and retraction, fiber strips or subpleural line, and bronchiectasis all indicate the organization changes. Both GGO and consolidation exist in the transitional period. In addition, some cases showed dynamic CT signs; that is, some lesions got better while the other lesions became enlarged or new lesions appeared. This may be due to the delayed inflammatory response or organization in part of the lung tissue. Of the 35 patients, 14 patients became aggravated, mainly manifesting in the increased lesion area and number, and the tendency of fusion.
