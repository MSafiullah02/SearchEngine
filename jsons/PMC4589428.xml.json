In others, the infection produces much more severe disease, and can result in hospitalization, supplemental oxygen requirement, respiratory failure, and even death. Although host factors, including the presence of pre-existing lung or heart disease, prematurity, and maternal-derived pre-existing humoral neutralizing antibody concentrations, account for some of these differences, they are not sufficient to fully explain the range of disease severity. Host genetic factors also account for some of these severity differences (1,2), but studies in identical twins have calculated that genetic factors explain only 16% of these differences (3).",

RSV subgroup A has been shown to be associated with slightly greater disease severity than RSV subgroup B in several studies (7,8), but in others, such a difference was not evident (9,10). Certain regions of the RSV-G (secretory or membrane-bound) protein are proinflammatory and mimic the human CXC3 chemokine.

After observing over 100 plates, we developed a system to categorize plaque morphology in the hematoxylin and eosin stained monolayers. If the virus-infected monolayer in the central portion of the plaque remained, it was defined as capped, whereas if the central portion did not remain, it was defined as uncapped. Plaques with well-defined borders were described as sharp, while plaques with undefined, finger-like, or pseudopodic borders were categorized as not sharp. One hundred and forty-one samples were culture-positive with sufficient growth to quantify by culture. Of these, 14 samples had a viral quantity which produced plaques too numerous to individually count. The viral loads for these samples were set at the upper level of quantification (6.78 log plaque forming unit (PFU)/ml). Because of the density of these plaques, they also could not be sized accurately. Thus, a different number of patients were evaluated for plaque morphology and viral load comparisons (Table 2). The mean plaque size (diameter) of each patient\u2019s isolate varied substantially (range 265.2\u2013975 \u03bcm). The percentage of capped plaques between patients also varied substantially (range 1\u2013100%). Plaques were observed to be either sharp or not sharp, with 70.5% of patient isolates forming plaques with not sharp characteristics (Figure 1, Table 2).",

Whether or not a patient\u2019s plaques were sharp or not did not vary by RSV subgroup (Figure 2e). The plaque size did not appear to correlate with RSV load, as assessed either by PCR (Figure 3a\u2013c) or by quantitative culture (infectious virus) (Figure 3d\u2013f). As the plaque size increased, the percentage of capped plaques within a patient\u2019s culture significantly decreased (Figure 3g,h). The percentage of capped plaques was not significantly correlated with the patient\u2019s RSV load (Figure 3j\u2013o).

There were seven patients for whom there was access to their lower respiratory tracts at enrollment. For these patients, the plaque characteristics were compared between their upper respiratory tract (nasal wash) and lower respiratory tract (deep tracheal aspirate) samples. The sharpness, percentage of capped plaques, and plaque sizes were similar from these two anatomic sites (Figure 7). The morphology of plaques from tracheal aspirates and nasal washes from the same individual at the same evaluation time point were not sharp in both samples for four patients, and sharp in both for two patients. One patient showed different plaque types between upper and lower respiratory tracts. The plaques displayed a sharp in the tracheal sample and a not sharp in the nasal wash sample. We only evaluated five paired nasal wash and tracheal aspirate samples because one nasal wash from one subject and one tracheal aspirate from the other subject produced plaques that were so numerous that they overlapped each other on the plate and did not allow accurate classification.",

It was shown that small plaque variants are related to virulence, propagation, and disease severity in multiple viruses. With herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), a small plaque phenotype associated with neuroinvasive disease, was isolated from the central nervous system of a severely affected infant (15,16). Subsequent passage of this small plaque phenotype virus produced larger plaques that lost their in vivo neuroinvasive properties (17). The neuroinvasiveness was suggested to be the result of lower efficiency of viral glycoprotein processing. In West Nile virus, a small plaque phenotype showed less efficiency of replication in in vitro culture compared to wild type (18), and it was attenuated in neuroinvasiveness (19). Chemically produced mutants of dengue virus type 4 and tick-borne encephalitis virus display characteristics of small plaque morphology, temperature sensitivity, and attenuated pathogenicity (20,21). Neuroblastoma cell-adapted yellow fever 17D virus also presents a small plaque phenotype, defective in cell penetration and attenuated growth efficiency (22,23,24). Plaque size has also been shown to differ among different strains of the influenza A H1N1 subtype. These plaque sizes have been linked via mathematical models to fundamental differences in key parameters, which characterize the virus replication fitness of these different strains (25).",

But, viral load is a complex interplay among viral-specific factors and the dynamic host factors of innate immunity and cognate immune responses. Studying the role of viral-specific factors is challenging for RSV because it cannot be reliably cultured after a single freeze-thaw cycle. Also, because RSV is an RNA virus, its mutation rate is rapid even within a single patient (28). Plaque size from clinical isolates was shown in other viruses to change significantly even over the first several passages in tissue culture (17,29). Therefore, when studying viral-specific factors, low-passage clinical isolates need to be utilized. Plaque morphology differences within a single uniform cell line are products of viral-specific factors. In the present study, the plaque assays from the evaluated patients were performed on fresh respiratory samples under identical conditions (12,14). Since plaques were evaluated in dilute respiratory secretions, (generally 100- to 1,000-fold dilutions) and not within an undiluted sample, any putative host effect existing within the secretions was greatly diluted and likely not to affect plaque morphology. Thus, the morphology of the plaque at a time point after inoculation represents an intrinsic viral-specific factor related to growth kinetics within that particular uniform cell line (12,14). Here, we evaluate viral-specific characteristics within the first culture passage of multiple RSV clinical isolates.",

We have previously shown that viral load is higher in infants infected with RSV-A compared to RSV-B (Figure 2c,d) (14). Our results suggest that intrinsic viral growth characteristics, not just host response factors, play a role in the viral load differences observed in infected patients. RSV-A produced significantly larger plaques than RSV-B. In addition to plaque size differences, the RSV-A plaques shed their caps more frequently than RSV-B plaques (Figure 2b). The fact that the infected cells within the monolayer were affected differently in infections with RSV-A compared to RSV-B suggests that there may be differences in the cytopathologic potential of these two RSV subgroups in addition to intrinsic viral replication parameters.",

As opposed to the epithelial cells of the human respiratory tract, HEp-2 cells are not polarized, and do not reach static growth rates in tissue culture. In natural human RSV infection, the virus is released preferentially from the apical surface of polarized respiratory epithelial cells. Because of these cellular differences, clinical RSV strains are likely to show different first-passage growth characteristics in HEp-2 cells compared to the human respiratory epithelial cells in which they were adapted for rapid growth. This limitation may explain why we did not observe a correlation between plaque size or morphology and disease severity (Figures 5 and 6).",
