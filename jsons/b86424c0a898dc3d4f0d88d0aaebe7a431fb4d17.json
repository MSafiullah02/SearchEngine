These shortages have led many facilities to consider strategies to extend or reuse PPE, particularly N95 filtering facepiece respirators. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have provided guidance on the acceptability of extended use or limited reuse of N95 respirators [3] .

            "text": "There is an urgent need for evidence regarding the effectiveness of decontamination strategies for PPE. The goal of the current study was to examine the effectiveness of UV-C light and a high-level disinfection cabinet for decontamination of N95 respirators. For UV-C light, we studied a 1-minute cycle delivered by a UV-C decontamination box that could potentially be used for rapid decontamination after each removal of a respirator and a 30-minute treatment delivered by a room decontamination device that might be used once daily. The high-level disinfection cabinet generates submicron droplets of aerosolized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide and has been shown to be very effective in eliminating microorganisms from hard surfaces in patient rooms and on portable equipment [12] [13] . We hypothesized that the disinfection cabinet would be very effective while UV-C light might have reduced efficacy in contrast to previous reports that evaluated microorganism reductions on steel disk carriers or hard surfaces in healthcare settings [14] [15] . Soft, irregular surfaces may present a challenge for UV-C decontamination due to the potential for areas of shadowing and absorption of organisms into sites with reduced delivery of UV-C [16] . Table 1 shows the test organisms studied and their characteristics. The enveloped double-stranded RNA virus bacteriophage Phi6 has been used as a surrogate for coronaviruses and influenza in previous studies [17] . The bacteriophages MS2 and Phi6 were propagated as previously described in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas syringae, respectively [1, 17] . The other test organisms were prepared as previously described [12] [13] . Efficacy of UV-C light against the test organisms on steel disk carriers Initial testing was performed to assess the efficacy of UV-C against all the test organisms using a modification of the American Society for Testing and Materials standard quantitative carrier disk test method (ASTM E-2197-11) [18] . The purpose of this assessment was to determine the relative susceptibility of bacteriophages Phi6 and MS2 to UV-C in comparison to bacterial and fungal organisms listed in Table 1 . For each pathogen, 10-\u03bcL aliquots containing ~10 6 colony-forming units (CFU) or plaque-forming units (PFU) in phosphate-buffered saline were spread to cover steel disks 20 mm in diameter. The steel disk carriers were positioned 32 inches from a room decontamination device (Moonbeam 3, Diversey, Fort Mill, SC) that was operated for a 90-second cycle or 180-second cycle for more UV-C resistant organisms. The relatively short cycle times were chosen in order to allow a comparison in log 10 reductions (ie, complete elimination of the inoculum was common for susceptible organisms at higher UV-C doses). The disks were positioned at a height of 3 feet and oriented vertically in parallel with the UV-C bulbs. The disks were processed as previously described [12] [13] . Log 10 CFU or PFU reductions were calculated by comparing recovery from UV-C-exposed carriers to untreated controls.",

Three N95 respirators were studied, the 3M 1860S, Moldex 1517, and Kimberly-Clark 46727. Aliquots of 10 \u03bcL containing 10 6 CFU or PFU of the test organisms were suspended in 8% simulated mucus prepared as previously described [19] . The test organisms were pipetted onto 3 different areas on the respirator surface (outer top, outer edge, and inner surface) ( Figure 1 ). The suspensions were spread with a sterile loop to cover an area of 1 cm 2 and allowed to air dry. The respirators were placed inside a UV-C box (Advanced Ultraviolet Systems, South Hill, VA) that provides decontamination with 1 lamp below and 1 above the item to be decontaminated. The UV-C cycle time for the UV-C box was 60 seconds. Additional experiments were conducted with the inoculated Moldex 1517 N95 respirator positioned 3 feet from 2 UV room decontamination devices, including a low-pressure mercury device (Optimum UV, Clorox Company, Oakland, CA) and a pulsed-xenon device (Xenex 426i, Xenex Disinfection Services, San Antonio, TX). Each device was operated for 2 cycles; 1 cycle of 15 minutes was performed with the exterior side of the mask facing the lamps, and another 15-minute cycle was performed with the interior side of the respirator facing the lamps. For each UV-C experiment, a colorimetric indicator (UVC Dose Indicator, American Ultraviolet, Lebanon, IN) was placed adjacent to the respirator to provide a visual assessment of UV-C delivery to the respirator.",

ANOVA models were adjusted for the additional experimental settings (side of mask, organism) while assessing the parameter of interest. All analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1 statistical software (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Table 2 shows the comparison of log 10 CFU or PFU reductions achieved on steel disk carriers by 90 or 180 seconds of exposure to UV-C from a room decontamination device. Bacteriophage MS2 and bacteriophage Phi6 were less susceptible to UV-C than vegetative bacteria such as MRSA, but more susceptible than Candida species and C. difficile spores. Figure 2 shows the log reductions achieved on the 3 N95 respirators with the 1-minute cycle in the UV-C box for MRSA, bacteriophage MS2, and bacteriophage Phi6. Reductions in MRSA were consistently greater than reductions of the bacteriophages for most test sites. Reductions in MS2 and Phi6 were similar at most test sites. Differences in reduction across masks were statistically significant (F = 5.69, df = 2, P < 0.01). Reductions were consistently lower on the 3M 1860S N95 respirator in comparison with the other respirators. Reductions were also consistently lower for the interior surfaces of the respirators versus the exterior surfaces; it was noted that the exterior surfaces were impermeable to the liquid suspensions while the interior surfaces were not. For the 3M 1860S N95 respirator, the reductions achieved on the exterior edge were lower than the exterior top surface; for this respirator, the edge has a fold that might result in shadowing that could reduce UV-C delivery (Figure 1 ).

The pulsed-xenon device was significantly less effective than the low-pressure mercury device (F = 6.38, df = 1, P = 0.01).

Moreover, the single cycle resulted in >6-log 10 reductions in MRSA and C. difficile spores inoculated on the respirator, despite greater UV-C resistance of these organisms on solid surfaces. Taken together, these data suggest that reduction in viral pathogens on N95 respirators might be challenging, in part because the small size of viral particles allows them to penetrate beneath the respirator surface to a greater extent than bacteria resulting in partial protection from technologies such as UV-C and aerosolized peracetic acid.

On solid surfaces, the efficacy of the high-level disinfection cabinet is similar to that reported for hydrogen peroxide vapor, which has also been considered as an option for PPE decontamination [9, 23] . Given the efficacy of the disinfection cabinet, this type of technology could potentially be used for disinfection of PPE that would be shared among different individuals in the setting of a crisis with inadequate supplies of PPE.",

Previous reports suggest that heat can be very effective against viruses in liquid suspension and heated droplets [24] [25] [26] [27] . The relative lack of efficacy of heat in our study may be attributable to the use of dry rather than moist heat, inoculation onto respirators rather than hard surfaces or liquid suspensions, and characteristics of the viruses being tested. Lore et al. [4] and Heimbuch et al. [6] found that moist heat (65\u00b0C for 20 minutes) was effective for inactivation of influenza virus. Darnell et al. [24] found that heating a liquid suspension with virus particles for 45 minutes at 75\u00b0C or 90 minutes at 65\u00b0C was effective for inactivation of SARS-CoV. Further studies are needed that include use of moist and dry heat for reduction of viruses inoculated onto respirators.",

Further studies are currently being conducted to evaluate the impact of multiple different decontamination methods on N95 performance such as filtration efficiency. Second, we applied the test organisms in a liquid suspension directly onto the surface of the N95 respirators and spread them over a relatively small surface area with a loop. We cannot exclude the possibility that the technologies would have been more effective if the inoculum was spread out over a larger surface area; spreading of an organism inoculum over a larger surface area has been shown to increase the efficacy of UV-C light [14] [15] . It has also been suggested that the method of deposition may influence results, and that methods that more closely mimic droplet and aerosol deposition on respirators should be used [6] . For the disinfection cabinet, we conducted additional experiments in which the inoculum was applied to the entire respirator as a fine spray with similar results (data not shown). Third, the testing was conducted as a laboratory simulation. Additional studies are needed to evaluate decontamination of N95 respirators used in clinical settings. Fourth, UV-C was less effective in our study than has been reported in previous investigations of UV-C for decontamination of influenza virus on respirators [4, 6] . This may be related to differences in methodology or to greater UV-C susceptibility of influenza virus than the bacteriophages studied. Previous studies suggest that viruses vary considerably in susceptibility to UV-C [28] . Fifth, we cannot exclude the possibility that a higher UV-C dose might have resulted in greater efficacy. However, there is evidence that very high UV-C doses may adversely affect N95 respirator performance and structural integrity [10] . Sixth, we only studied 3 brands of N95 respirators and 3 methods of decontamination. We are currently evaluating the effectiveness of several other technologies. Finally, we did not include data on decontamination of other types of PPE. However, testing with surgical face masks yielded similar results (data not shown).",
