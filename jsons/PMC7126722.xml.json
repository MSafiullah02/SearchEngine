            "text": "Most human coronaviruses (eg, hCoV 229E, OC43, NL63) cause mild upper respiratory tract diseases, except occasionally in immunocompromised hosts. However, 2 novel coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and a recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) may cause serious viral pneumonitis, leading to hospitalization and death.1, 2 Coronaviruses are large, lipid-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. Viral genome analyses revealed that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are Group B and Group C betacoronavirus, respectively, and are closely related to coronaviruses found in bats.1, 2, 3, 4 Intermediate mammalian hosts such as civet cats have been implicated for SARS-CoV before its adaptation for human transmission,1, 3 but no such host has been identified for MERS-CoV. These coronaviruses encode a surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) that attaches the virus to host cells, determining its host range and tropism, and is the target for neutralizing antibodies.1, 3 It has been shown that SARS-CoV uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-II) as the primary cellular receptor; the human C-type lectin (DC/L-SIGN) has also been implicated as an alternative receptor.1, 3, 5 MERS-CoV has been shown to bind to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also called CD26), an interspecies-conserved protein found on the surface of several cell types including the nonciliated cells in human airways,4, 5, 6 and this interaction may explain its broad host range and its ability to cause cross-species zoonotic transmission.4 There is no vaccine available at present for coronaviruses.7\n",

            "text": "SARS-CoV emerged in Southern China (Guangdong Province) in February 2003; the first victims were those who had direct contact with live animals, either in the wet markets or in restaurants selling these animals as winter food.1, 3 The disease quickly spread to Hong Kong; and within a few weeks, through international air travel, it had reached Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, and Canada.1, 3, 8 By July 2003, more than 30 countries were affected, resulting in 8096 confirmed infections and 774 deaths (9.6%).8 Mathematical modeling of the early phase of the outbreak estimated that the basic reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV was in the range of 2.2 to 3.7; the primary mode of transmission was via respiratory droplets.9 Two key epidemiologic features of SARS were frequent nosocomial outbreaks and superspreading events, which exacerbated its transmission. Notably, 1706 of 8096 (21%) of SARS victims were health care workers.8 It has been suggested that viral replication was at its peak in SARS patients at the time of hospitalization when symptoms worsen (see later discussion). Transmission was facilitated by close bed proximity and the application of aerosol-generating procedures (eg, intubation, resuscitation) and devices (eg, continuous positive airway pressure and biphasic positive airway pressure [BiPAP] treatments).10 In 1 example, nebulization from a bronchodilator in a SARS patient resulted in a major hospital outbreak involving 138 inpatients, doctors, nurses, allied health workers, and medical students who had worked in the same medical ward.11 Subsequent studies indicated that the attack rates were between 10% and 60% in the hospital settings.10 An example of a community superspreading event that involved more than 300 residents occurred in a private housing estate (Amoy Gardens) in Hong Kong. Drying up of the U-shaped bathroom floor drain and backflow of contaminated sewage (from a SARS patient with diarrhea), coupled with the toilet\u2019s exhaust fan, might have created infectious aerosols that moved upward through the warm air shaft of the building. Computational fluid-dynamics modeling suggested possible dispersion by wind flow, causing long-range transmission to nearby buildings.1 This and other evidence suggested that SARS could be opportunistically airborne.3, 12 Appropriate precautions to prevent airborne transmission should be implemented in the health care setting, particularly when respiratory procedures and devices are used.12 Notably, laboratory-related SARS cases have occurred since the epidemic,13 which highlights the importance of laboratory safety in handling these contagious viral pathogens.",

Chest radiographs first showed patchy consolidation and ground-glass changes that rapidly progressed in the next few days to involve multiple lobes (Fig. 1\n).12 In certain cases, findings on computed tomography scans of the thorax closely resembled bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (eg, peripheral air-space consolidation).23 Laboratory features included lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, increased transaminases, creatinine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase.

            "text": "There is no established therapy for coronavirus infection. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, a range of agents was used in patients but their efficacy is questionable. Ribavirin, although shown to be active in vitro, did not seem to provide clinical benefit (>90% of cases progressed despite treatment).3, 7, 11, 22, 26 Lopinavir-ritonavir, a protease inhibitor used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS with evidence of in vitro activity against SARS-CoV, was given to 41 patients in Hong Kong and was associated with viral load reduction and fewer cases of ARDS and fewer deaths; however, the study was uncontrolled.7, 26, 27 Convalescent plasma obtained from recovering individuals that contained neutralizing antibodies had also been used. In 1 study, 19 patients who received such therapy had better survival (100% vs 66.2%) and discharge rates (77.8% vs 23.0%) compared with 21 controls.28 This form of treatment has also been used in fulminant cases of H5N1 and 2009 H1N1 influenza with apparent success.3 Subsequent in vitro and animal (ferrets, hamsters, macaques) studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies targeting the S protein may provide neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV, resulting in viral load reduction and resolution of lung lesions29, 30, 31, 32, 33; however, no clinical data are available. Several in vitro and animal (mice, macaques) studies have consistently shown that type I interferons, if given prophylactically or shortly after exposure, may protect against SARS.34, 35 In humans, it has been shown that interferon-\u03b1 given within 5 days of illness may result in lower rates of intubation (11.1% vs 23.1%) and death (0.0% vs 7.7%); however, the study was small (9 vs 13 patients) and confounded by corticosteroid use.7 Preliminary data have shown that type I and type III interferons have in vitro activity against MERS-CoV and these observations may deserve further investigation.5, 15, 36 There are no published data on antibody therapies but this approach may also be useful.6 Other potential treatments that have been tested in animal models include short interfering RNA (siRNA),37 proteasome inhibitors,38 prophylactic toll-like receptor agonist administration,39 and immunomodulants.3\n",

The RSV genome encodes 2 nonstructural (NS1 and NS2) and 9 structural proteins, including the F (fusion) and G (attachment) glycoproteins on the viral envelope. Antibodies against the F and G proteins are neutralizing, and have been shown to confer protection against RSV infection in animal models45; these targets are likely important for the development of antiviral agents and vaccines. Immunity after primary infection (which generally occurs by 2 years of age) is partial and short-lived; thus, reinfections can occur throughout life.45, 46 Low serum neutralizing antibody levels in adults predicts infection risk and disease severity.46 Although immunologic mechanisms (eg, cytokine responses) have been implicated in the pathogenesis, emerging evidence suggests that uncontrolled viral replication (indicated by high viral load) drives disease manifestations and leads to severe outcomes.47, 48, 49 Such findings provide an important rationale for the approach to antiviral drug development against RSV.",

In healthy young adults, RSV may cause self-limiting upper respiratory illnesses; in the profoundly immunosuppressed, progressive lower respiratory tract disease can occur (17%\u201384%), resulting in fulminant pneumonitis and high mortality (7%\u201383%).58 Older adults hospitalized for RSV infection may present with fever, cough, sputum production, wheezing, and dyspnea. Although wheezing and dyspnea may be more common with RSV, and the magnitude of fever sometimes lower, such findings could not reliably differentiate it from influenza.51, 59 Radiographically, about 50% to 60% of cases show active pneumonic changes such as consolidations and ground-glass opacities; the remainder may show evidence of congestive heart failure and features of underlying chronic lung conditions.59, 60 Typically, the pneumonic changes are small, patchy, and unilateral and disproportional to the degree of hypoxemia detected in these patients; a diffuse interstitial infiltration pattern is rare.59, 60 Overall, more than 70% of patients hospitalized with RSV develop severe lower respiratory complications, including pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma; 10% to 15% have cardiovascular complications such as congestive heart failure or acute coronary syndrome.45, 46, 51, 59, 60 Bacterial superinfection occurred in 12% to 17% of cases,59 10% to 18% of patients required ventilatory support (invasive/noninvasive), and the overall mortality was approximately 8% to 10%.45, 59, 60 Late death might occur as a result of multiple cardiorespiratory complications or exacerbations of underlying medical conditions.

Following endocytosis and nuclear localization, early gene expression inhibits various host immune responses and initiates viral replication, whereas late gene expression directs viral assembly and release through host cell lysis. Human adenoviruses have no animal reservoir and do not infect other species; nonhuman adenoviruses that infect other species do not cause zoonotic disease. The traditional classification of human adenoviruses is complex and includes at least 52 serotypes. Adenoviruses have also been divided into 7 species (A\u2013G) based on various biological and biochemical characteristics; each species includes more than 1 serotype and each serotype includes multiple genotypes. Although there is no strict correlation between species or serotype and disease manifestation, it is possible to make certain generalizations; for example, respiratory disease is caused by species B, C, and E, whereas species F causes gastroenteritis. A comprehensive review of serotype associations with disease has recently been published.71\n",

The predominant routes of transmission include direct contact with aerosolized droplets in military settings, fecal-oral spread among children or those with prolonged shedding in the stool, and exposure to infected fomites, blood, or tissues. After an incubation period that varies from 2 days to 2 weeks, adenoviruses may be cleared or may cause long-standing asymptomatic infection of lymphoid or other mucosal cells, particularly in children.72, 73 In some cases, adenoviruses may become latent while retaining the potential to undergo endogenous reactivation at a later time point in a highly immune-suppressed host. A combination of innate and adaptive immune responses is required for control or prevention of adenovirus infection in vivo.74 Innate antiviral immunity is mediated by natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and monocytes/macrophages that are capable of directly killing infected cells or secreting inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit additional effector cell types.75 Optimal adaptive immunity includes neutralizing antibody production by antigen-specific B cells as well as generation and expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes that are capable of eliminating infected host cells. Adenoviruses dedicate a significant portion of their genome to subversion of these host defense mechanisms to ensure infected cell survival and facilitate virus transmission in vivo.76, 77\n",

Possible epidemiologic clues for adenovirus infection include a cluster of febrile pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, or respiratory disease in individuals living in close quarters, including day-care centers, chronic care facilities, or military barracks. Another clue is the simultaneous presence of circulating adenoviral isolates in the community, particularly during the summer or autumn months when influenza is less common. Several reports from military training centers have shown that serotype 3, 4, or 7 may be associated with severe disease as a result of greater virulence or transmissibility. Prompted by frequent outbreaks beginning in the 1950s that affected up to 10% of all military recruits, enteric-coated live oral vaccines against serotypes 4 and 7 were introduced in 1971 and were successful in diminishing acute respiratory disease. Immunization was progressively stopped from 1996 to 1999 and was followed by a resurgence of epidemic disease caused by the vaccine serotypes 3 and 7.80 The global epidemiology of adenovirus infections in healthy populations includes 2 novel Ad7 genome types that have been shown to cause severe or fatal disease during several civilian and military outbreaks in North America and are closely related to endemic strains in China and South America.81 Similarly, a virulent serotype 14 adenovirus strain that had not previously been observed in the United States was recently shown to cause severe and fatal adenovirus disease in children and adult military recruits.82 Adenovirus infection is also an important emerging pathogen among HSCT recipients; the incidence varies from 4.9% to 29% according to the transplant regimen, age of the study population, and diagnostic testing strategy.83, 84 Relatively little is known about the incidence of adenovirus infection among adult solid-organ transplant recipients; however, plasma DNA was detected in 7.2% of cases during a 1-year prospective surveillance study.85 Most transplant recipients were asymptomatic at the time of adenovirus detection and all recovered spontaneously. The incidence of adenovirus in patients with HIV infection, undergoing cancer chemotherapy, or with congenital immunodeficiency has been comprehensively reviewed.86\n",

For example, only 18 cases of potentially life-threatening adenoviral pneumonia were published between 1974 and 1998,87 and since then 14 additional cases have been reported and analyzed.88 In the more recent series, two-thirds of the patients were male, the mean age was 32.75 years, and the overall mortality rate was 57%. The clinical and radiological features of severe adenoviral disease were generally nonspecific and could mimic bacterial sepsis, although the presence of conjunctivitis or diarrhea served as potential diagnostic clues. A variety of serotypes have been documented to cause sporadic cases of severe civilian89, 90 or fatal military adenoviral pneumonia91, 92 in healthy adults, although the relationship between genotype and virulence has not been comprehensively investigated.89 The largest reported outbreak occurred in a mental health center and was caused by an unusual adenovirus (serotype 35) that had been associated with disease only among immunocompromised patients.93 In that outbreak, affected individuals presented with fever and cough associated with diffuse interstitial or dense unilateral pulmonary infiltrates. No other distinguishing clinical features were evident; however, in several instances, the development of mild leukopenia was observed. Six of 18 infected cases required ICU admission, 5 required intubation, and 4 developed ARDS with septic shock; all patients recovered except for 1 individual with chronic renal insufficiency who required prolonged intubation and died 2 months after admission. Typical pathologic findings in fatal cases of adenoviral pneumonia include severe necrotizing bronchiolitis with fibrinous obstruction, interstitial inflammation, and hyaline membranes lined by characteristic alveolar smudge cells that have a large rounded nucleus containing basophilic inclusions with a surrounding halo.94\n",

The infection rates reported in the literature vary widely and are likely due to different diagnostic approaches, host factors, and conditioning regimens; thus, standardization of detection methods is required to definitively quantify the incidence of disease in this patient population.97 In general, pediatric stem cell transplant recipients are much more likely to develop adenovirus infection (20%\u201326%) compared with adults (9%) because they have limited natural exposure before transplant and lack species cross-reactive T cells.98, 99 Most adenoviral infections are detected during the first 100 days after transplantation although the median time to detection is much shorter in children (<30 days) compared with adults (>90 days).97 Several risk factors for adenoviral infection (Box 2\n) and disease (Box 3\n) after transplant that reflect a state of profound host immune deficiency have been identified. Adenoviral infection may cause subclinical viremia, single organ system dysfunction (interstitial pneumonitis, cholangiohepatitis, hemorrhagic cystitis, or colitis, and so forth) or may disseminate to involve 2 or more organ systems and cause a significantly higher mortality (8%\u201326%).98 Detection of adenovirus in the blood may precede symptomatic disease by 2 to 3 weeks and provides an opportunity for preemptive intervention95, 98; however, identification of patients who might benefit most from therapy remains challenging. For example, a retrospective study of 26 pediatric HSCT recipients showed that 7 of the 11 patients diagnosed with adenovirus infection cleared the virus without antiviral therapy.100 Coinfection or sequential infection with multiple serotypes has been demonstrated in pediatric HSCT recipients and these individuals may have prolonged viral excretion.Box 2Risk factors for adenovirus infection in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\nYounger ageMismatched or unrelated graftsTotal body irradiationPresence of adenovirus antibody in the donorUse of antithymocyte globulin or anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab)T-cell depleted or stem cell (CD34+) selected graft\nData from Refs.83, 84, 101, 117Box 3Risk factors for development of adenovirus disease in HSCTx\nHigh dose immunosuppressionSevere or prolonged lymphopeniaModerate to severe GVHDDetection of adenovirus in peripheral bloodRising viral load in peripheral bloodRising viral load in stool\nData from Refs.83, 84, 101, 117",

In all these situations, severe adenovirus infection may lead to premature graft loss or death. Risk factors for adenoviral infection include younger age (particularly children <5 years old), intestinal transplantation, augmented immune suppression including antilymphocyte antibodies, and transplantation of a seropositive organ into a seronegative recipient.102 In addition to exogenous acquisition or possible transmission via the allograft,103 organ transplant recipients may reactivate endogenous adenoviral infection after receiving immune suppression. In an older series, the incidence in adult liver transplant patients was 5.8% and most patients had symptomatic disease of varying severity.104 More recent studies using PCR detection have also shown that asymptomatic infection in the blood of adult solid-organ transplant recipients is common (6.5%\u201322.5%); however, most cases have not been associated with progressive disease or acute graft rejection and for this reason routine screening is not recommended.85, 101, 102 Molecular detection of adenovirus in blood or affected tissue samples is indicated for adult solid-organ transplant recipients with compatible disease manifestations. Conversely, in pediatric solid-organ recipients, serial monitoring of viral load in the blood may precede the development of symptomatic disease and serve as a useful guide for the initiation of antiviral therapy.105 Currently there are no specific measures for prevention of adenovirus infection in the transplant recipient.",

Despite this potential confounding effect of multiple coinfections, various case reports have described severe pneumonia, hepatitis, meningoencephalitis, nephritis, gastrointestinal, and potentially fatal disseminated disease caused by adenovirus.107, 108 A comprehensive review estimated that 12% of patients with clinical AIDS develop active adenovirus infection. In these studies, the mean age of patients was 31 years and within 2 months of first detection of adenovirus, the associated mortality was 45%. The most remarkable aspects of adenovirus infection in AIDS were the diversity of serotypes and frequency of antigenically intermediate isolates that are presumed to arise through spontaneous mutation within a strain or recombination between coinfecting serotypes during long-term infection. To clarify the epidemiology of adenovirus infection in patients infected with HIV, a prospective longitudinal study was subsequently performed and determined that the 1-year actuarial incidence of adenovirus infection was 17% with a CD4 count greater than 200 mm3 and 38% with a CD4 count less than 200 mm3. Prolonged and generally asymptomatic shedding from the gastrointestinal tract, and to a lesser degree the urinary tract, was documented in most patients. These data suggest that the mortality rate of adenovirus infection in AIDS may be lower than previously stated; however, differences in patient populations and adenovirus detection methods preclude a definitive conclusion of the true attributable mortality. Nonetheless, in the absence of another plausible explanation, adenovirus infection should be considered as a potential causative agent in the critically ill patient infected with HIV who has severe pneumonia, encephalitis, or hepatitis and a high retroviral load and/or a CD4 cell count less than 200 mm3.",

In such cases, adequate sample procurement from all potentially infected sites is required for further analysis. For severe respiratory failure, a nasopharyngeal aspirate, endotracheal secretions, or bronchoalveolar lavage are all suitable and relatively easy to obtain for viral and other microbiological studies. Comprehensive analysis of lung tissue is also extremely valuable if a transbronchial or surgical biopsy has been performed. When disseminated disease is suspected, a blood sample should also be obtained for detection of circulating adenovirus. Until recently, the gold standard for diagnosis of adenoviral disease from clinical samples was identification of a characteristic cytopathic effect using tissue culture\u2013based methods; however, this approach is slow, costly, technically challenging, and may lack sensitivity. Direct antigen detection in respiratory specimens by immunofluorescence or related techniques is a rapid but less sensitive alternative to viral isolation.111, 112 Serology for determination of antibody responses and viral serotyping or genotyping methods are impractical for use in clinical decision making and are mainly used for epidemiologic investigations. All these techniques have now been supplanted by molecular detection methods that can be applied to blood, stool, sputum, or biopsy specimens.113 Qualitative PCR and quantitative real-time PCR are rapid and highly sensitive techniques; however, both are critically dependent on the design of primers and probes that are able to amplify and detect the genomes of all clinically relevant adenoviruses.114, 115 Amplification of 1 or more highly conserved adenovirus hexon gene sequence or the use of multiple primer/probe combinations in a single assay have been successfully used by several investigators to identify all disease-associated serotypes. Medical centers may choose to establish their own local PCR protocols for adenovirus detection or refer their samples to commercial laboratories or other service providers. Regardless of where adenovirus PCR testing is done, it is essential to know the sensitivity and specificity of the testing protocol for each type of clinical sample that is analyzed.",

On the other hand, adenovirus detection from the same site on multiple occasions or from multiple sites is predictive of disease risk and death.116 It has been suggested that detection of adenovirus in the blood of stem cell transplant patients should be defined as probable disseminated disease and may signify a window of opportunity for early intervention.117 One such approach using serial analysis of viral load for therapeutic decision making in pediatric stem cell transplant patients was recently published; however, it is not known whether this strategy is applicable to adults.98, 118 A decreasing viral copy number may be used as a surrogate for a response to therapy; conversely, a titer greater than 106/mL is associated with a greater likelihood of death.116 The usefulness of early intervention after stem cell transplantation is supported by another series in which delayed initiation of cidofovir seemed to be associated with a poor outcome.119\n",

Several studies have correlated clinical recovery with the return of T cells; therefore, a reduction of immune suppression is generally recommended as soon as a diagnosis of adenovirus infection has been established.120 A variety of different antiviral agents including ribavirin, ganciclovir, and cidofovir have been used to treat adenovirus infection; however, none of these compounds have been shown to be particularly efficacious for established disease.102 Cidofovir is an acyclic analogue of deoxycytidine monophosphate, which has in vitro activity against several DNA viruses and is approved for treatment of CMV retinitis. Because of its poor bioavailability, cidofovir must be given intravenously and is converted by host enzymes to an active diphosphate form with a prolonged intracellular half-life. Cidofovir diphosphate exhibits higher binding affinity for viral DNA polymerase compared with the host cell enzyme and inhibits viral replication by competing with host nucleotides for incorporation to viral DNA.121, 122 The most common dosing regimens are 5 mg/kg intravenously weekly for 2 weeks then once every other week until an appropriate clinical response is observed. Cidofovir is filtered and actively secreted by the proximal tubule of the kidney with 90% of the drug excreted unchanged in the urine. Dose-dependent nephrotoxicity is the major adverse effect of cidofovir; it presents as proteinuria, azotemia, glycosuria, metabolic acidosis, and, uncommonly, Fanconi syndrome. Saline prehydration and administration of probenecid are recommended to mitigate cidofovir toxicity; a dose adjustment or discontinuation of cidofovir is recommended in the case of an increasing creatinine level or proteinuria. Lipid analogues such as hexadecyloxypropyl-cidofovir exhibit much better cellular penetration and greater in vitro activity against adenovirus and have shown promising results in an immune-suppressed animal model of disseminated disease.123 Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue used to treat severe RSV pneumonia, has not shown consistent clinical benefits or efficacy for a variety of severe adenovirus infections and is not recommended.124 Similarly, ganciclovir shows in vitro activity against some adenovirus isolates and was reported to reduce the incidence of infection in stem cell transplantation125; however, there is insufficient clinical experience to support its usefulness.",

Another approach that has been effective in preventing and treating diseases related to EBV and CMV reactivations in HSCT recipients is reconstitution of the host with in vitro expanded virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).126 Widespread application of this strategy for definitive cure of adenovirus infection is limited by incomplete knowledge of antigen-specific T-cell immunity as well as the practical, technical, regulatory, and financial barriers to generation of sufficient subgroup cross-reactive, adenovirus-specific, cytotoxic T lymphocytes ex vivo.90, 97 Novel CD4 and CD8 T-cell epitopes of the hexon protein have been recently identified and may lead to improved adoptive immunotherapy strategies in the future.

Outside North America, a variety of hantaviruses such as the Hantaan virus are known to cause a serious and fatal acute disease termed hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. In North America, the related Sin Nombre virus (SNV) is the most common cause of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, an acute condition characterized by severe respiratory failure, shock, and mild renal dysfunction. In South America, the Andes virus causes a similar condition and is the only hantavirus to be associated with person to person transmission.128, 129, 130 Zoonotic transmission of SNV and related strains occurs by domestic or occupational exposure to aerosols of infected rodent excreta and is more likely when rodent populations are abundant and enter buildings in search of food or cover. The first outbreak of North American hantavirus pulmonary syndrome was described in the Four Corners region of the United States in 1993 with a subsequent outbreak in 1998; both episodes were attributed to higher rodent densities and greater human exposure as a result of increased precipitation.131, 132\n",

Historical information such as recent travel to rural areas with endemic hantavirus infection and/or exposure to potentially infected rodents that may have entered human dwellings is crucial to its initial consideration. Patients presenting with severe hantavirus infection invariably have a detectable humoral immune response and positive serologic testing for IgM or IgG is diagnostic of disease in low-prevalence geographic areas.142 Viremia occurs during the first 10 days of illness and may be detected by RT-PCR of blood143; however, isolation of hantavirus requires appropriate containment facilities and is not practical for diagnostic purposes.",
