Based on the nucleotide sequence and deduced percentage of amino acid similarity in the nucleoprotein (N), the Lyssavirus genus is divided into six established genotypes (Bourhy et al., 1992, Bourhy et al., 1993). The genus is composed of classical rabies virus (genotype 1) and the rabies-related viruses: Lagos Bat virus (genotype 2), Mokola virus (genotype 3), Duvenhage virus (genotype 4), and European Bat Lyssaviruses (EBL) 1 and 2 (genotypes 5 and 6, respectively) (Familusi et al., 1972, Crick et al., 1982, Foggin, 1983, King and Crick, 1988, Bourhy et al., 1993). The more recent Australian Bat Lyssavirus, first reported in 1996 (Fraser et al., 1996), has been classified as a separate and distinct genotype (genotype 7) within the Lyssavirus genus (Gould et al., 1998) (Fig. 1\n).",

The illness caused by the rabies-related viruses is virtually indistinguishable from classical rabies (Smith et al., 1992). Classical rabies viruses have a world-wide distribution except for a few island nations such as Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand and Hawaii, the continents of Australia and Antarctica and an increasing number of Western European countries. The Lagos Bat, Mokola and Duvenhage viruses of genotypes 2\u20134 are mainly restricted in distribution to the African Continent. However, a genotype 2 isolate has been isolated recently from an imported fruit bat in France (Aubert, 1999).",

The resultant data can then be used for phylogenetic analyses that enable a highly accurate characterisation of virus isolates. A hemi-nested reverse transcriptase PCR (hnRT-PCR) assay that uses a cocktail of primers capable of detecting the six established genotypes of rabies and rabies-related viruses has been described (Heaton et al., 1997). The hnRT-PCR offers a higher level of sensitivity than the FAT for normal and decomposed tissues (Heaton et al., 1997), but it does not distinguish between the genotypes. However, the resultant N-terminal 405 bp sequence data is sufficient to distinguish between the various genotypes (Fig. 1). More recently, an assay using PCR-ELISA was described which could amplify and distinguish genotype 1, 5 and 6 viruses (Black et al., 2000).",

TaqMan\u2122 is an adaptation by Perkin\u2013Elmer (Livak et al., 1995) of the 5\u2032 nuclease PCR assay described by Lee et al. (1993). A result confirming the genetic lineage of an isolate can be achieved using TaqMan\u2122 probes within a few minutes of completing a standard PCR or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) cycle. A closed tube system can be used for the PCR and to measure the fluorescence emitted by the TaqMan\u2122 probes, resulting in minimal post-PCR manipulation and therefore, a reduction in potential cross contamination. Since its development, TaqMan\u2122 has found many applications in research, viral and bacteriological diagnostics and epidemiological studies (Chen et al., 1997, Sharma et al., 1999, McGoldrick et al., 1998, Kimura et al., 1999, Laue et al., 1999).",

On completion of the PCR the samples were analysed in the closed PCR tubes using a Applied Biosystems LS50B luminescence spectrometer to quantify the fluorescence emitted by the TaqMan\u2122 probes. The tubes were scanned at 518 nm (FAM) and then 582 nm (TAMRA), with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. Data acquisition and analyses were carried out using the Fluorescence Data Manager (Applied Biosystems) and microsoft excel Spreadsheets. The increase in sample fluorescence was compared with the fluorescence of no template controls in triplicate. The magnitude of the generated signal (\u0394RQ) represents the difference between the sample RQ (RQ+) and the mean value attained for the no template controls RQ (RQ\u2212), where RQ is the emission intensity of the reporter divided by the emission intensity of the quencher. In this equation, the quencher acts as an internal standard to normalise fluctuations in fluorescent intensity due to non-specific effects such as concentration changes due to volume fluctuations. Any other fluctuations not due to PCR-related nuclease digestion are normalised by taking the RQ+ value for a tube that contains all the components including template and subtracting the RQ\u2212 value for the no template control tubes. This final \u0394RQ value reliably indicates the magnitude of the signal generated by the given set of PCR conditions. A final calculation, defined as the threshold \u0394RQ, was carried out to obtain a numerical cut-off value above which a given \u0394RQ should represent a positive result. This value is calculated at a 99% confidence interval using the standard deviation (S.D.) obtained from the three no template controls (Perkin\u2013Elmer, 1994). For the purposes of this assay a higher threshold \u0394RQ (1.0) than that calculated using this method (usually <0.5) was adopted.",

The RT-PCR was therefore, re-optimised for each TaqMan\u2122 probe with respect to magnesium concentration and annealing temperature to obtain the highest intensity of reporter fluorescence whilst maintaining the highest specificity possible. Agarose gel electrophoretic analyses of the RT-PCR products in the TaqMan\u2122 assays gave weaker specific and often secondary non-specific bands, but were useful for confirming negative TaqMan\u2122 results during assay development.

In the UK the most likely genotypes that could enter this country from mainland Europe are classical rabies and the EBLs. At present genotype differentiation relies on RT-PCR and subsequent sequencing or monoclonal antibody typing. Rapid genotyping of any strain found in the UK would be particularly important, as the outcome may dictate the control measures implemented. Classical rabies has the potential to establish within indigenous terrestrial animal populations and hence may require the implementation of extensive control measures, whereas, the EBLs are likely to be limited to spread among the UK bat population and could prove difficult to control.",

Monoclonal antibody analysis usually necessitates the growth of virus in cell culture, which may be impossible or result in a delay of several days with decomposed material. An additional problem encountered with monoclonal antibody typing is that the results are subject to individual interpretation. Sequence analysis gives a definitive answer and is thus more reliable, but can also take several days to achieve a result unless there is direct access to automated sequencing equipment. An additional advantage of TaqMan\u2122 is that it is a closed tube system that significantly reduces the risk of cross contamination by PCR products and thus results in increased confidence in the results acquired.",

There is a large amount of N gene sequence data available, which, on examination, revealed conserved regions specific to each genotype that could be used to design genotype specific TaqMan\u2122 probes. The classical rabies virus isolates have a greater representation in our archive and due to extensive geographical distribution and host range, demonstrate a much broader genetic diversity than the other genotypes. For this reason, three probes were required in combination to detect all of the classical isolates tested.

            "text": "The TaqMan\u2122 probes were optimised individually with relation to magnesium concentration and annealing temperature to yield the highest intensity of reporter fluorescent intensity without compromising specificity. Unfortunately, when relative specificities were compared, the probes were found to have different optimum Mg2+ concentrations. Using the Universal 2X master mix (Applied Biosystems), which became available more recently it may be possible to standardise the reaction mixes to ease panel preparation. Magnesium chloride affects annealing and the melting temperatures of both the TaqMan\u2122 probe and the PCR primers as it help stabilise the hybridisation complexes. It is also required for Taq DNA polymerase activity and affects FAM quenching by TAMRA on the probe. Increasing the magnesium concentration can enhance TAMRA quenching in the intact probe (Livak et al., 1995), which is important for calculation of RQ\u2212, that is, the lower the reporter emissions in RQ\u2212, the greater \u0394RQ will be in the presence of specific template. However, too little or too much magnesium can result in reduced amplification efficiency or amplification of non-target sequences. The PCR primers were known to produce (Heaton et al., 1997) specific product at a range of temperatures, although this was strongest and cleanest with respect to non-specific products at 51 \u00b0C. The annealing temperature was therefore optimised, again to achieve the best possible \u0394RQ values. We observed that when transferring the technology to the newer ABI7200 reader, the \u0394RQ values were much higher than obtained previously using the LS50B and the threshold value required re-evaluation. Hence, the actual values represented in Fig. 2 may be significantly different when alternative readers are used.",

All the rabies and rabies-related virus RNA samples used in the development of this assay had been amplified previously using the PCR protocol described by Heaton et al. (1997) and the products sequenced partially and genotyped. Due to the large number of available isolates, a representative group of genotype 1 isolates were carefully selected for this covering as wide a range of animal hosts, geographical isolation and sequence variation, as possible. All of the genotype 2\u20136 isolates available in our archive were tested and a selection of unrelated viruses were also tested to ensure the specificity of the assays for rabies and rabies-related viruses. Seven of the eight probes were used directly to give a definitive result, whilst the remaining probe, that for detecting Lagos Bat isolates had to be used alongside the Mokola probe to determine whether a positive result is a Lagos Bat or Mokola isolate. Detection by the Mokola probe or both probes indicated a Mokola isolate, while detection with the Lagos Bat probe and not the Mokola probe indicated a Lagos Bat isolate. For complete confidence, automated sequencing may be used to confirm the genotype of an isolate. It was not deemed necessary to further discriminate between the EBL1a and b and EBL2a and b subgroups as generic EBL1 and EBL2 probes would be sufficient for the aims of this assay. In the case of an outbreak, the control measures introduced would be the same whether an \u2018a\u2019 or \u2018b\u2019 subgroup was responsible.",
