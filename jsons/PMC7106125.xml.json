            "text": "Health-focused nanotechnologies have put under screening a growing spectrum of materials whose properties can be modified during fabrication. Merging synthesis and smart functionalization of natural polymers allows straightforward cost-effective production of novel materials specifically designed for target application.1, 2 The performance of polymers synthetic in origin has been investigated for nanotechnology applications, as well.3 However, in this case production and functionalization are usually two separate processes. Among natural polymers, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), the highly tunable bacterial polyesters, play an important role in the development of next generation biomaterials (Figure 1\n). Their properties are greatly influenced by the type (e.g., short chain length PHA, scl-PHA; medium chain length PHA, mcl-PHA) and homogeneity of hydroxyalkanoic monomer building blocks, and others (Figure 2\n).4 The ability to edit and redirect bacterial cell system through metabolic or genetic engineering, enables the construction of platforms to produce versatile materials carrying wide range of functional groups which confer desired properties to the polymer.4, 5, 6 Alternatively, the direct use of highly structured natural PHA nanoparticulate entities formed within bacterial cells opened new avenues for attractive biomaterial design where tailor-made beads are functionalized using intrinsic bacterial granule producing system.1, 7, 8 These possibly phospholipid-coated inclusions carry granule-associated proteins (GAPs) on their surfaces, such as: i) PHA synthases, involved in the polymerization of the biopolyester; ii) PHA depolymerases, responsible for PHA mobilization; iii) phasins, the main structural components of GAPs and iv) other proteins such as enzymes related to the synthesis of PHA monomers, as well as transcriptional regulators not classified as GAPs (Figure 3\n).1, 9, 10 The implementation of these new assets, aside from broadening the potential, allows customizing and fine tuning to improve polymer performance for each specific application (Figure 4\n).",

            "text": "Despite the fact naturally occurring nanoparticles have been present for millions of years, nanotechnology is first and foremost focused on in vitro man-made particles.11 Nevertheless, dependently on the target application, in vivo biological or in vitro synthetic approach for fusion protein immobilization to the PHA granule surface might better meet the requirements (Table 2\n). The in vivo PHA granule functionalization consists of GAP fusion immobilization onto the granule surface simultaneously with the granule formation inside the PHA-producing host (Figure 4).7, 49 On the other hand, the production of these bioinspired constructs in vitro is based on PHA extraction, followed by in vitro bead production and in vitro GAP fusion protein immobilization via GAP-bead interaction (Figure 4).30 The main advantages of this in vitro cell-free system are: i) the possibility of tight control of nanoparticle disassembly and reassembly process; ii) absence of competition among the recombinant GAP-fusion and wild type proteins; iii) tight control over particle size and immobilized protein/active agent concentration; iv) possibility of endotoxin removal, crucial for the design of every biomedical setup. Nevertheless, PHA isolation and in vitro nanobead production require more tedious methodology (e.g., to avoid PHA particle aggregation) in comparison to isolation of in vivo produced PHA granules. Also, the use of non-environmentally friendly solvents is needed for in vitro technology. All mentioned significantly increase the costs of in vitro PHA nanobead production and make the technology suitable mainly for added-value applications where tight control over particle size and active agent concentration is needed.30 In the line of safety, in vitro approach is highly convenient for nanomedical purposes, including nanofabrication, imaging, drug delivery and tissue engineering, where the use of endotoxin-free PHA is requisite.4 Importantly, the fabrication of endotoxin-free PHA vehicles can also be achieved using in vivo settings (see below). Some applications such as protein delivery to natural environments do not necessary acquire endotoxin free PHA and can benefit from an in vivo approach where bacterial naturally produced nanoscale particulate entities can be used in a straightforward manner.16 Furthermore, as bacterial polymeric particles can be functionalized in vivo before isolation there is a clear environmental and economic advantage over those produced chemically. Particle functionalization is achieved through the recombinant expression of fusion proteins, where natural GAPs are used as anchoring tag for foreign protein immobilization. Perfect example is BioF tag from Pseudomonas putida based on the use of intrinsic P. putida PHA granules as scaffold to immobilize fusion proteins in vivo. Once fermentation under optimal PHA production conditions is accomplished, granules decorated with the BioF-protein fusions are obtained as the end product (Figure 5\n).8, 16 Dependently on protein release treatment, up to 100% of fusion protein can be recovered with a good purity, since the phasins represent major GAPs.7 Additionally, the possibility of minimizing the presence of GAP proteins to increase the yield of fusion protein binding and purity has been investigated.8 BioF system was proven efficient for in vivo coating of mcl-PHA granules with Cry1Ab derived insect-specific toxin protein. Generation of bioplastic-BioF-insect specific toxin complex indicated excellent performance of BioF tag as a device for spreading active polypeptides to the environment without the need for active agent release and purification.16 Similarly, organophosphohydrolase from Agrobacterium radiobacter immobilized on polyester inclusions of recombinant Escherichia coli was shown suitable for bioremediation applications.17 Testing this new in vivo assets and analyzing their limits, indicated the possible room for improvement. Current trends deal with implementation of new methodological platforms, as synthetic biology, to improve the production process and productivity.57 This highlights the importance of re-programming approaches to optimize the system and design strategies focused on meeting the necessities of each specific application. In the line of fine tuning of biological interfaces and the use of PHA as vehicles, addressing the key factors of PHA machinery permitted overcoming biological barriers to reach maximal in vivo coating of PHA nanobead and at the same time avoid side effects concerning disordered granule biodistribution after cell division (see below).8\n",

Thus, the window of possibilities that each specific GAP offers implies different modes to connect recombinant protein and PHA nanobeads (covalent, hydrophobic or non-specific) (Figure 4). Although so far very little is known about their structure and interaction with the PHA granules,58 phasins are highly attractive among GAPs, largely due to the wide assortment of structurally different compositions compared to other GAPs (Figure 4). Phasins have been utilized as affinity tags and through protein engineering designed to build recombinant protein purification system. This provides low cost method for production and purification of high added value proteins in a continuous way.49 Significant improvements in bio-separation technology were made by upgrading the system interconnecting phasins and target proteins via self-cleaving intein.47 This approach enabled in vivo recombinant protein immobilization onto the granule and the release of purified proteins once the native scl-PHA particles were recovered, which in turn pushed bio-separation technology several steps ahead, toward convenience and economic production. In vivo immobilized correctly folded eukaryotic proteins on the surface of PHA granules across phasin protein have been used for fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) based diagnostics.18\n",

Moreover, specific environmental conditions can alter release rates.64 In contrast, covalent attachment enables unique natural cross-linking of a protein and polymeric support and allows better control over protein release kinetics. PHA synthase offers the possibility of covalent protein-PHA conjugation. Both N- and C- terminal of PHA synthase were shown suitable for in vivo assembly of functionalized polyester beads.14, 17, 26, 31, 44, 62, 65, 66 This approach based on PHA nanobead functionalization through PhaC helps to circumvent the washing off of non-covalently bound fusion proteins during the process.67 The particles with an intrinsic label can be tailored to covalently display proteins for applications in antibody capture-based diagnostic (e.g., immunochromatographic strips or bach-and-elute bioseparation applications). The modular arrangement of the protein domains provides a large design space for the production of custom-made materials.20 By introducing enterokinase digestion site between the tag and target protein the latter can be efficiently released from polymer support providing efficient and cost-effective methodology to obtain added value product.67 Similarly, to facilitate target protein release from bio-bead, thrombin cleavage site was used as a linker,68 as well as previously mentioned autolytic intein. This enables straightforward liberation of target protein.52, 69\n",

E. coli is default host microorganism for recombinant protein production and often the first choice. The fact that this strain serves as a workhorse of basic and applied research worldwide is largely due to the possibility of high recombinant protein yield achievement. Remarkably, E. coli, a previous non-PHA producer, through pathway engineering has been set up to produce up to 150 g/L cell dry weight (CDW) with final PHA content of more than 80%.4 This was used to co-produce several tagged proteins (maltose binding protein (MBP), \u03b2-galactosidase (LacZ), chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)) with polyhydroxybuyrate (PHB) granules in the E. coli cells. Proteins were purified with yields of 3.17-7.96 mg/g CDW.47 Currently applying recombinant E. coli cells allows covering of the granule surface up to 20% of total proteins associated with the bead,19 while using wild type such as P. putida strain as much as 2% can be achieved.8 It should be noted that different bacterial strains have different PHA producing capacities regarding polyester type (scl- or mcl-PHA) and relative amount to CDW. Besides, the cause of altered final recombinant protein yield might be the consequence of the type of GAPs used to immobilize recombinant protein, affecting the specific recombinant protein\u2013PHA interaction. Importantly, R. eutropha naturally produces more than 200 g/L of PHB, which gets to 80% of CDW similarly to recombinant production in E. coli,40 while yields of mcl-PHA obtained with P. putida reach 65%.71\nP. putida productivity can be upgraded to 84% of intracellular mcl-PHA, incorporating knock-out mutations of beta-oxidation genes fadA and fadB.72 Recombinant E. coli is able to produce 20% of mcl-PHA when beta-oxidation is impaired due to the deletion of fadB,4 whereas Qi et al. used metabolic routing strategy to inhibit fatty acid beta-oxidation by acrylic acid in recombinant E. coli (fadR) and produce 60% mcl-PHA.73 Additionally, phaJ encoding (R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase, was demonstrated to supply 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA of C4-C6 for PHA biosynthesis via beta-oxidation pathway.74, 75 Its co-expression with phaC in E. coli led to production of PHA with monomer composition containing C4, C6, C8, and C10 from unrelated carbon source.76, 77\n",

Also, the overexpression of foreign genes over physiological rates usually triggers a spectrum of conformational stress responses and causes the accumulation of insoluble protein versions that do not reach their native conformation.78 These pseudospherical protein aggregates, inclusion bodies, are considered undesired byproducts of protein production processes. Other bottlenecks as the loss of the plasmid due to the instability of introduced genes, use of antibiotics and gene expression expensive inducers have been partially solved, however they still represent a challenge (reviewed in53). Taking all this together, the advantages of using wild type strains as host should not be overlooked. Specific strategies applied on the components of PHA machinery can drive productivities of high contents of PHA immobilized recombinant proteins in wild type strains as reported for E. coli.8 On the positive side, a great understanding of PHA synthesis in model mcl-PHA producer strains such as P. putida, has been gained through systems biology (\u201comics\u201d data, genome-scale metabolic models, etc.).57, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83 Powerful genetic tools based on synthetic biology84 support bottom-up approaches and might be used to design P. putida strains that generate added-value bioproducts, such as active mcl-PHA based nanobeads. The great value of this bacterium as an autolytic specialized strain for mcl-PHA production has also been demonstrated.85 Due to its broad metabolic versatility and genetic plasticity, which allow a variety of renewable carbon sources to be used for PHA production, P. putida is one of the most prominent candidates for protein production. Aside from Pseudomonas, many other Gram-positive and Gram-negative eubacterial genera such as Bacillus, Ralstonia, Aeromonas, Rhodobacter, Rhodospirillum, Rhodococcus were shown suitable for production of PHA nanobeads.4, 86\n",

            "text": "Complex subcellular architecture and self-organizing nano- and micro-compartments of bacterial cell hold great promise, largely due to the possibility for their biofunctionalization. Disturbing these highly coordinated systems might easily imbalance the physiology of the bacterial cell. PHA granules take over the control of the carbon and energy storage and thus represent important element of bacterial metabolic network.83 Thereafter, from an energy flow and survival physiology standpoint, balanced distribution of PHA between daughter cells after division has fundamental importance as competitive setting. Understanding the PHA machinery and interplay of its components was shown crucial for optimization of the in vivo system for production of protein functionalized PHA nanobeads.8, 9 Different scenarios involving different molecular events and interactions as well as granule localization have been proposed by Micelle, Budding and Scaffold model of granule formation.7 In contrast to a Micelle model where PHA granules are assumed to be randomly distributed in the cytoplasm, Budding and Scaffold model suggests defined localization proposing granule\u2013cell membrane interaction or PhaC-scaffold molecule interplay, respectively. Recently proposed Scaffold model suggest cooperative work of PhaC and phasins in granule formation. Since, phasins\u2013PhaC interaction has been spotted in some bacterial strains (e.g., PhaM, phasin-like protein that interacts with PhaC in R. eutropha), phasins were proposed as the main components forming network that interconnects granules, DNA and enzymes involved in PHA metabolism.9, 87, 88 This network should serve as a mediation element responsible for granule localization within the cell and their balanced segregation between daughter cells during cell division. On some of GAP interactions depends their activity, while the function of others is still to be discovered. For instance, homo-oligomerization of R. eutropha PhaC1Reu and PhaRReu\n89, 90 and P. putida PhaC1 and hetero-oligomerization of PhaCBmeg with PhaRBmeg are known to be essential for accomplishing the function. Meanwhile, the interaction of certain phasins with other PHA players was identified,90 but their exact function is to be unraveled. Namely, P. putida PhaF was proposed to form homo- and hetero-tetramers interacting with PhaI through short leucine zipper.58 Another suggested role of phasins is the control of the access of PHA depolymerases. Indeed, weak PhaP2\u2013PhaZ interaction was reported in R. eutropha.90 All these interactions are taught to contribute to the formation of net-like structure found in the vicinity of PHA granules91 and provide a window into the system functioning. PhaF has been shown to have a role as a central player in the machinery, controlling PHA granule segregation and localization in the cell, since it shows a unique ability to bind at least two ligands (the PHA granules and the nucleoid).7, 9, 58, 92 The peculiar structural organization of PhaF into two domains performing diverse functions (i.e., C-terminal histon-like domain, N-terminal phasin-like domain) supplies an explanation to its biological role.8, 9 Moreover, whether or not P. putida cytoskeletal or other GAP proteins facilitate the organization of granules in needle array like structure (Figure 4), by direct or indirect interaction with PhaF, is still an open question and currently the precise mechanisms by which intermediary PhaF positions the PHA granules are still unknown.9 Similarly, PhaM of R. eutropha can bind both DNA and PHA.93 Therefore, to refine the system it is needed to unravel the puzzle of how functionally diverse, or even a multifunctional set of GAPs, should be combined to generate an optimal yield of in vivo immobilized protein onto the granule surface and engender a coherent cell phenotype.",

In this respect, the key phasin factors have been identified for optimal PHA production in P. putida addressing the minimum amount of complete phasin proteins necessary to achieve adequate PHA production and higher yield of immobilized recombinant protein.8 Applying this strategy maximum BioF (N-terminal of PhaF) fusion protein concentration was in vivo immobilized onto the PHA beads (2.2% of recombinant protein/PHA) without compromising phasins' intrinsic function.8 Also, this demonstrated the swappable nature of PhaI phasin and BioF PHA binding modules in terms of their physiological function and illustrated the utility of the PhaF/PhaI structure redundancy, being autonomous modular cooperatively working units.8, 58 Altogether, these examples show that the escalating drive to identify the connections within the complex system of GAPs network is fueled by the need to develop new strategies that will lead to improvement of protein immobilization onto the PHA beads. Metabolic and biotechnology capacities of P. putida, as well as global understanding of the capabilities of this strain are facilitated by metabolic models that enabled integration of experimental along with genomic and high-throughput data.57\n",

            "text": "Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or endotoxins, also designated as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognized by innate immune system are most potent identified microbial mediators implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock. LPS is the most prominent \u2018alarm molecule\u2019 sensed by the host's early warning system of innate immunity presaging the threat of invasion by Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.95 Thus, presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxins in PHA nanobeads produced in Gram-negative bacteria makes these in vivo naturally produced particles unsuitable for biomedical applications.96, 97 The problem occurs because co-purification of pyrogenic outer LPS together with PHA granules cannot be avoided. In vitro approach on the other hand offers the possibility of endotoxin removal from PHA polymer. The concentration of endotoxins in PHA is greatly influenced by purification strategy and might vary from more than 104\n EU/g to less than 1 EU/g.55, 98 The methodology for endotoxin elimination depends on type of PHA (e.g., scl-PHA, mcl-PHA, presence of functional groups, etc.) and each results in different rates of polymer recovery.55, 98 However, in vitro strategy remains hampered by the necessity of extensive and tedious purification methodology to achieve the levels in compliance with the endotoxin requirements for biomedical application according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Generally, for products that directly or indirectly contact the cardiovascular system and lymphatic system the limit is 0.5 EU/mL or 20 EU/device, while for devices in contact with cerebrospinal fluid the limit is 0.06 EU/mL or 2.15 EU/device.99 All mentioned factors together with the bacteria growth conditions significantly influence the total cost of the production of endotoxin-free polymer. To get around this limitation, alternative sources of functionalized PHA granules free of LPS contamination are Gram-positive bacteria. They offer a platform for production of LPS free tailored beads due to the difference in the structure of their cell envelopes compared to Gram-negative bacteria.100 Even so, other PAMPs, such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PG), found in Gram-positive bacterial pathogens are now appreciated to activate many of the same or similar host defense networks induced by LPS.95 Subsequently their presence in PHAs isolated from Gram-positive bacteria might have immunogenic activities similar to LPS.101 Among PAMPs, LTA predominates in the Bacillus, whereas actinomycete bacteria typically synthesize lipoglycans.102 Importantly, certain Gram-positive PHA producing strains (e.g., Bacillus circulans, Bacillus polymyxa) lack both, LTA and lipoglycans.103\nClostridium and Staphylococcus citreus were reported to lack LTA and may be considered for recombinant PHA production.104 Hence, emerging area to be investigated are the mechanisms triggered by PAMPs of Gram-positive PHA producing bacteria regarding mammalian immune system. Remarkably, Gram-positive genera Corynebacterium, Nocardia and Rhodococcus are the only wild-type bacteria, which naturally synthesize the commercially important copolymer poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), P(3HB-co-3HV), from simple carbon sources such as glucose.105, 106 The genus Bacillus, in common with many other PHA-accumulating Gram-positive bacteria, accumulates co-polymers of 3HB when grown on different substrates.98 For instance, copolymers of P(3HB-co-3HV) are accumulated when the cultures are fed with odd-chain-length n-alkanoic acids such as propionic acid, valeric acid and heptanoic acid.107\n",

As such, it showed excellent in vitro performance on supporting and promoting neural stem cell, human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell and fibroblasts adhesion and growth.111, 112, 113 PhaP-RGD fusion immobilization allowed evading tedious cross-linking processes and chemical immobilization that easily damage the biological activity of attached protein. New approaches based on nanoparticulate carriers with targeting capability for imaging and drug delivery to cancer cells are slowly replacing longstanding concepts. With this aim, posterior to synthesis of loaded PHA particles, surface modification was performed via hydrophobic interaction between particle surface and growing PHA chain from PhaC enzyme fusion with RGD that stabilized core-shell structure.31 However, little attention was placed on endotoxin removal and scaffold performance in vivo. Alternatively, the PHA micelles synthesis was performed in vitro by mixing PhaC-RGD and 3HB-CoA and therefore avoiding the incorporation of endotoxins.66\n",

The main characteristic of synthetic and natural polyesters, significant for nanoparticle production and drug delivery systems are outlined in Table 3\n. Degradation of both, synthetic and natural polyesters, results in biologically compatible and metabolizable moieties. However, their degradation rates and patterns differ considerably. Thereby, synthetic polyesters are suitable for sustained release due to their slow degradation rates. Importantly, in the case of natural polyesters the drug release kinetics can be more easily controlled via conventionally engineering the PHA matrix parameters to reach desired degradation rates. For instance, scl-PHAs are crystalline and hydrophobic, but many pores are formed on the surface and the drugs are released quickly without any polymer degradation. Mcl-PHA copolymers on the other hand, have low melting point and low crystallinity, therefore they are more suitable for drug delivery.",

Nevertheless, the main advantage of synthetic PLGA over natural PHAs is its FDA approval as drug delivery platform and lower production costs.

            "text": "Engineering biomaterial nanobeads has attracted much attention of the research community. Ongoing efforts to push the boundaries are reflected in the design of wide range of nanostructured bacterial materials for innovative medicines.1 Apart from PHA, biologically produced nanoparticles are highly diverse and omnipresent in prokaryotic (magnetosomes, storage paricles, etc.), but also in eukaryotic (e.g., exosomes, lipoproteins, etc.) systems giving the ground to the further development of bionanothechnology.11 Smart PHA nanoparticles described in this review provide grounds on how these bacterial polymers, traditionally considered for industrial or conventional clinical applications, are progressively entering the most innovative biomedical fields as promising and highly flexible materials. The fact that PHA can be produced from inexpensive waste carbon sources enhanced commercial interest in these polymers. On the other hand, interest in functionalized PHA nanobead technology has been hampered by existing legislation in terms of endotoxin concentration allowed for biomedical application.99 Importantly, these technical hurdles were successfully surmounted following in vitro approach or using certain Gram-positive strains for in vivo functionalized bead assembly. Nevertheless, up-to-date PHAs are produced on the large-scale exclusively using Gram-negative bacteria.4 For simplicity and cost control the goal is to adapt the approach to a system in which maximal covering of PHA granule surface with recombinant protein is achieved. Different module swapping strategies and fine tuning were proven effective to reach this goal.8 To meet the challenges new tendencies suggest multi-functionality. The concept behind multi-functional beads would allow the design of variety of biomedical systems with unique advantage of adaptability and subsequently responding to current trends of biomedicine. PHA nanoparticles allow multifunctional tuning due to the possibility of the use of variety of GAPs, as well as their both N- and C-terminal domains, to immobilize diverse proteins simultaneously. Nevertheless, many nanotoxicological tests on their safety have to be performed before they can overtake the current stage of synthetic polyesters. Aside from FDA approval for biomedical applications, the production costs should be reduced. The big challenges that PHA industry has to overcome132 to lead to PHA nanobeads successfully commercialization are: i) reduction of production costs; ii) construction of functional PHA production strains to precisely control the structure of PHA molecules increasing the consistency of structure and properties to reach the level of competitor synthetic polymers; iii) reach the simplicity of synthetic polymer processing; iv) use of alternative renewable sources for production to avoid use of expensive glucose; v) development of high value added applications.",
