The molecular mechanisms that these pathogens employ to cross the maternal circulation to the fetal compartment is a subject of current research, which provides very interesting perspectives. In this minireview, we discuss different findings that have contributed to our understanding of how viruses can access cellular components of the placenta and the pathogenic mechanisms that facilitate the process of infection at the maternal\u2013fetal interface, particularly in trophoblasts.",

The placenta and fetal membranes represent a selective barrier with two main functions: nurturing and protection of the developing fetus (Brett et al.2014; Wong and Cox 2016). The human placenta is a chimeric tissue that contains maternal and fetal components, which are organized so as to promote communication between the mother and fetus (Aplin 2000; Coyne 2016). Placental development starts in the endometrium 7 days after fertilization; the placenta is formed by different cell types that possess specific functions, such as the synthesis of molecules essential for fetal development, nutrient transport and other functions (Aplin 2000). Chorionic villi are the main functional component of the placenta and can be classified into floating villi and anchoring villi. The former are in intimate contact with maternal fluids, participating in the transport of nutrients, gases and waste between the fetus and the mother, whereas the latter are associated with the uterine wall, forming a support structure between the mother and the fetus (Huppertz 2008).",

            "text": "Among the multiple cellular components that constitute the placenta, trophoblasts play a fundamental role in the architecture and functionality of this organ. The floating villi and anchoring villi are composed of trophoblasts (Benirschke and Kaufmann 2012). An individual chorionic villus has a polarized epithelium of cytotrophoblast progenitors (CTBs) anchored to a basal membrane. These cells possess high proliferative and migratory capacity, which allows them to leave the basal membrane and permits their differentiation into floating villi and anchoring villi. In the case of floating villi, the CTBs fuse to form a group of multinucleated cells known as syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs); these cells attach to fetal villous trees in the placenta, and the rest of the villi are in contact with the maternal circulation. The route leading to the assembly of the anchoring villi is formed by aggregates of differentiated CTBs, which organize into non-polarized mononuclear columns known as extravillous trophoblasts. EVTs have the capacity to attach and penetrate the uterine wall for forming a bridge between the mother and fetus. In the region between EVT columns and the endometrium, CTBs acquire an invasive phenotype for invading the maternal decidua and replacing the endothelial cells that constitute the uterine veins and arteries. The invasion of EVTs into the maternal decidua culminates with the formation of hybrid cells that allow fusion of maternal and fetal circulation (Fig. 1). This process defines placenta formation, which plays a very important role during gestation by promoting nurturing, protection and support in the uterine cavity (Cross, Werb and Fisher 1994; Norwitz, Schust and Fisher 2001; Maltepe, Bakardjiev and Fisher 2010).",

During viral infection, one of the main challenges that viruses face is penetrating the target cell (Blaas 2016). For this, the virus employs host cell surface molecules as receptors. This interaction between the virus and host cell induces conformational changes on viral proteins that promote viral entry into the host cell by two main mechanisms: (i) through direct fusion with the cell plasma membrane or (ii) through an internalization process within endosomes and further release into the cytoplasm (Schneider-Schaulies 2000; Yamauchi and Greber 2016).",

These cell line models maintain many of the structural and functional characteristics of trophoblasts and can therefore be widely used for studying viral infections occurring at the maternal\u2013fetal interface (Vargas et al.2012). Pioneering studies with adenoviruses showed that trophoblasts express anchoring receptors that are necessary for the infection process (Koi et al.2001). The entry of adenoviruses into the target cell first requires interaction between the viral fiber protein and the coxsackievirus B (CBV) and adenovirus receptor (CAR); this is followed by interaction of the base of the viral protein penton with the integrins \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b25 that are present in both differentiated and undifferentiated trophoblasts (Koi et al.2001). CAR expression varies with gestational age and the differentiation state of the trophoblast. This receptor is expressed only in villous trophoblasts and at very low levels in STBs in first-trimester placentas. However, CARs are not expressed in TBs or STBs in third-trimester placentas; this receptor's expression remains constant in EVTs (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that the susceptibility to adenovirus infection depends on the stage of trophoblast differentiation (MacCalman et al.1996).",

Some of these receptors have been identified in CTBs; viral entry can be inhibited by blocking them with specific antibodies, which may help avoid the entry of HCMV into the placenta (Feire, Koss and Compton 2004). Integrin receptors are differentially expressed in several types of trophoblasts, which suggests that susceptibility to HCMV infection in the placenta is related to change from an epithelial to endothelial phenotype (Fig. 2A). This transition is distinguished by a repertoire of specific integrins that are expressed during the natural development of the human placenta (Maidji et al.2007).",

Transcytosis is a type of transport that several cell types employ to mobilize molecules between two cellular compartments or environments. The movement of molecules may occur from the apical zone to the basolateral zone or vice versa; this will depend on the nature of the transported molecule and its impact on the cellular physiology (Tuma and Hubbard 2003). Although transcytosis has been mainly studied in epithelial cells, this process is not restricted to this cell type; it has also been observed in osteoclasts, neurons and cells that constitute the human placenta (Coxon and Taylor 2008; Herve, Ghinea and Scherrmann 2008; Kzhyshkowska et al.2008). Both CTBs and STBs employ this mechanism for selective transport of a large amount of nutrients, hormones, growth factors and cytokines, as well as for the transfer of passive immunity to the foetus, since transcytosis is also utilized for the transport of maternal antibodies to the fetal circulation (Ellinger et al.1999; Fuchs and Ellinger 2004).",

It has been proposed that CTBs obtained from first-trimester placentas are susceptible to HIV-1 infection and that STBs from third-trimester placentas develop latent infection (Moussa et al.1999; Sheikh, Polliotti and Miller 2000). This strongly suggests that the cellular components of the placenta with specific differentiation states work as a barrier against HIV-1 infection. Parry and co-workers demonstrated that CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 receptors, which are important for the entry mechanisms of HIV-1, are not expressed in villous trophoblasts isolated from second- and third-trimester placentas, as well as from the BeWo choriocarcinoma cell line. This finding has been correlated with the fact that free HIV-1 viral particles cannot infect these cells. Therefore, it has been suggested that the infection process in trophoblasts occurs through primary infection of cells of hematopoietic origin (lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells), since it was observed that BeWo cells were infected when they were co-cultured with HIV-1-infected PBMCs and that this effect was not observed when the cells were incubated with free viral particles. Furthermore, infection of BeWo cells co-cultured with HIV-1-infected PBMCs was not observed when the cells were treated with transcytosis inhibitors, such as colchicine, supporting the importance of this transport mechanism during infection of trophoblasts by this virus (Parry et al.2006).",

In particular, HIV-1 internalization in trophoblast cells may follow different routes: viruses can be degraded by lysosomes through the endosomal system; alternatively, viral particles may access the basolateral surface of trophoblast cells through transcytosis or may be transported by the recycling machinery to the apical surface of these cells. Viral particles employ early endosomes that are positive for the protein early endosome antigen-1 (EEA-1) in order to obtain access into trophoblasts, suggesting that this process occurs rapidly or that few viral particles obtain access through this route. Additionally, HIV-1 particles accumulate in late endosomes, which are positive for CD63, and could be degraded through fusion to lysosomes or released into the cytoplasm to initiate the cycle of infection of trophoblasts. When these cells were treated with inhibitors of endosomal acidification, reduction in the expression of viral genes was observed, which suggests that viral particles utilizing this route may access the cytoplasm, promoting viral replication in these cells (Vidricaire, Imbeault and Tremblay 2004).",

The transport of HBV particles depends on the differentiation states of the trophoblast, which suggests that HBV-specific receptors are present on the membrane of the trophoblast only during the early stages of the pregnancy, similar to that observed in HCMV (Bhat and Anderson 2007).",

Delorme-Axford and collaborators determined that CBV uses lipid rafts during entry into trophoblasts; the study demonstrated the presence of receptors for CBV in the apical and basolateral zones in the BeWo cell line. Additionally, it was observed that this virus uses a pathway that involves lipid rafts independent of clathrin, caveolin-1 and dynamin II. This finding breaks the dogma of the entry process in cells permissive to CBV as these receptors are essential for CBV infection. The access of CBV to trophoblasts is inhibited by the use of drugs that disaggregate lipid rafts; however, this does not happen when clathrin, caveolin and dynamin expression is inhibited, suggesting that both mechanisms contribute to CBV entry (Fig. 2A). The Src tyrosine kinase family also plays a key role in the entry of CBV into trophoblasts, as viral entry decreases when Src is pharmacologically inhibited (Delorme-Axford et al.2013). Future studies should focus on the interaction of cell factors that allow viral entry through the maternal\u2013fetal interface.",

In contrast, the intrinsic pathway is activated through intracellular signals that act directly on the mitochondria, promoting a shift in its membrane permeability and the release of mitochondrial mediators that induce the assembly of a caspase-activating complex known as the apoptosome. The death-inducing complex and apoptosome induce the activation of effector caspases 3 and 7, which cleave substrates critical for promoting death (Galluzzi et al.2008).",

HPV infection in the placenta could occur early during pregnancy. In some studies, placental tissues from gestational weeks 11 and 13 were recovered transabdominally to avoid contamination with HPV-infected cervical cells; however, viral DNA was still detected in these placenta samples (Weyn et al.2011). The presence of HPV in the cervix and placenta has been found to be associated with spontaneous abortion and spontaneous delivery (Amb\u00fchl et al.2016). This may be explained by the fact that HPV-16 induces apoptosis in a first-trimester trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SV); Gomez et al. (2008) showed that trophoblasts transfected with a plasmid containing the HPV-16 genome had a higher apoptotic rate than those transfected with an empty plasmid. Furthermore, HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins promote cell death on transfection in trophoblasts, an effect that is more evident in the case of E7 (You et al.2002). The pro-apoptotic role of E7 has been linked to its interaction with retinoblastoma protein (Fig. 3), which promotes the dissociation of retinoblastoma protein from the transcription factor E2F complex, in turn inducing the degradation of the protein through the proteasomal pathway and the activation of E2F to activate apoptosis (Barbosa et al.1990; Boyer, Wazer and Band 1996). In another study, the role of the E5, E6 and E7 oncoproteins was evaluated in BeWo cells transfected with these sequences (Boulenouar et al.2010). The oncoproteins had negative effects on growth and cellular adhesion and increased the migratory and invasive properties of trophoblasts. This phenomenon will be discussed in more detail in later sections. This study showed that the E5 oncoprotein had an important cytotoxic effect on the transfected BeWo cells because of its effects on cellular adhesion. Additionally, the toxic effect of E5 is promoted by its activity as a viroporin, a hydrophobic protein that oligomerizes in the host cell membrane to form a hydrophilic pore that can alter cell permeability (Nieto-Torres et al.2015). Keratinocytes transfected with the E5 sequence promote osmotic stress (Fig. 3), resulting in apoptosis (Wetherill et al.2012). Further studies involving primary culture trophoblasts or choriocarcinoma cell lines are required to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying apoptosis induction by HPV-16 oncoproteins that could be associated with the induction of spontaneous abortions.",

NS1 can be associated with DNA in a covalent manner, promoting distortion of the double helix and generating cleavages in a single strand, which are signals for initiating the apoptotic process. NS1 can inhibit the DNA repair pathways by associating with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase protein (Fig. 3), which, together with DNA damage, promotes apoptosis (Poole et al.2011).

            "text": "It is clear that many viruses induce apoptosis in the host cell to stimulate viral dissemination in the late stages of infection; however, many of these pathogens develop strategies to inhibit cell death in the early stages of the infection cycle, thus allowing for increased viral replication (Richard and Tulasne 2012). There have been studies regarding this phenomenon in viruses that infect the maternal\u2013fetal interface. In the trophoblast cell line JEG-3, HBV infection was found to induce early and late apoptosis in low percentages of cells (Fig. 3), when analyzed with specific apoptotic markers, that is annexin V and DNA fragmentation, respectively (Bai et al.2013). Additional studies have demonstrated that HBV X protein (HBx) plays an important role during infection by modulating cellular pathways related to proliferation or apoptosis (Wang, Studach and Andrisani 2011). The HBx antigen has been detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HBV-infected trophoblast cells (Fig. 3), and its presence in the cytoplasm is correlated with high phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) expression, which might be involved in the process of resistance to apoptosis in placental tissue (Bai et al.2012; Wang et al.2016). In addition, HBx protein could be involved in apoptosis inhibition through the Smad signaling pathway; when HTR-8 cells were transfected with HBx protein, p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 (Fig. 3), which are important regulators of proliferation and apoptosis, were upregulated (Cui et al.2015). The HBx protein is a promoter of proliferation in other cellular systems, for example, when oval cells were transfected with HBx plasmid, cyclin D1 overexpression was noted. The use of a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and MEK was found to inhibit AKT and ERK activation and decrease cyclin D1 proliferation and expression in HBx-transfected oval cells (Fig. 3), suggesting the participation of this mechanism in the effect of HBx on proliferation (Wang et al.2014). More studies involving trophoblast systems are required to identify the mechanism underlying the effect of HBx protein during infection in the placenta.",

This response is activated by the participation of receptors of the innate immune system (Fig. 4), such as Toll-like receptor-8 and Toll-like receptor-3, which are widely expressed in different components of the maternal\u2013fetal interface (Kumar et al.2016). Besides this pro-inflammatory response, synthetic RNAs promote a caspase-dependent apoptotic process, wherein pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bid and Bax are activated; additionally, XIAPS proteins, which are canonical apoptosis inhibitors, are inactivated. All this strongly suggests that trophoblasts that have been stimulated by viral genetic material promote paracrine and autocrine mediators, which in turn are responsible for apoptosis induction (Aldo et al.2010). These studies provide the first evidence regarding the mechanism through which viral infections can compromise the integrity and function of trophoblasts, thus allowing the dissemination of the virus to other cells at the maternal\u2013fetal interface or in the fetal circulation.",

CTBs and STBs infected with HCMV express and secrete tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, a cytokine that promotes activation of the apoptotic mechanisms in uninfected cells in a paracrine manner. Consistent with these results, the apoptotic effect was found to be inhibited through treatment with a neutralizing antibody against TNF-\u03b1. The early genes IE1\u201372 and IE2\u201386 of HCMV induced the same phenomenon of promoting TNF-\u03b1 expression and secretion when transfected into trophoblasts. Transfected trophoblasts with HCMV genes can induce paracrine apoptosis in untransfected cells through TNF-\u03b1 secretion (Chan et al.2002). These data suggest that HCMV infection stimulates the immune response in cells from the maternal\u2013fetal interface via its viral proteins, compromising the viability of this structure and favoring the process of infection.",

Studies performed using JAR or JEGIII cells during HBV infection have demonstrated that these trophoblast cell lines are more susceptible to HBV when incubated with TNF-\u03b1, as evidenced by increased viral uptake and increase in viral antigens, than on infection alone (Li et al.2007). This would suggest that TNF-\u03b1 favors a suitable environment for vertical infection. This phenomenon has also been identified in trophoblasts isolated from the placentas of women infected with HIV-1, wherein increased TNF-\u03b1 expression was correlated with increase in the transcription of the viral gag gene (Lee et al.1997). TNF-\u03b1 can participate in the reactivation of latent HIV-1 infection in STBs. Interaction between macrophages and infected STBs seems to stimulate TNF-\u03b1 secretion, which in turn acts on infected STBs, activating viral replication and production (Bacsi et al.2001). The mechanism through which TNF-\u03b1 promotes increase in the production of viral progeny has not been entirely elucidated (Fig. 4); however, it has been suggested that TNF-\u03b1 can induce the transcription of viral genes through activation of nuclear factor \u03baB. The fact that nuclear factor \u03baB can associate directly with the long terminal repeat region of the viral genome might explain the effect of TNF-\u03b1 observed during placental infection with HIV-1 (Duh et al.1989). Future studies should investigate whether nuclear factor \u03baB has the same effect in trophoblasts infected with HIV-1.",

The transport of these antibodies through the STB system is mediated by a well-defined process.

The antibodies generated during primary infection with HCMV were found to possess protective activity against secondary infection; additionally, during the pregnancy of women who were pre-exposed to the virus, the antibodies could neutralize the infection and therefore, fetal damage was not evident (Parruti et al.2013). Maternal antibodies specific for HCMV and with high neutralizing activity can form complexes with viral particles, which in turn are transported through different cellular components of the maternal\u2013fetal interface, wherein no active infection processes are observed. However, a study involving women with low titres of anti-HCMV antibodies showed the presence of viral antigens in decidual cells, trophoblasts and the endothelium. This demonstrates the protective role of antibodies during vertical infection with HCMV (Pereira et al.2003). Low-affinity virus\u2013antibody complexes undergo transcytosis in the STBs of the floating villi during HCMV infection. In the STBs, these complexes can be transported to the basal membrane and later come into contact with CTBs that express receptors for viral entry (Fig. 4). These complexes can also be endocytosed by placental macrophages that also express the FcR, promoting focal infection that can extend to stromal fibroblasts, capillaries and fetal leukocytes. Both events result in vertical infection (Maidji et al.2006).",

Like DENV, this pathogen belongs to the Flavivirus genus. The high homology between the structural proteins of these two viruses, specifically the envelope protein, could be associated with ADE. Therefore, during infection with DENV, the immune response of the host can induce cross-reactive antibodies against other members of the genus, like ZIKV. Studies focusing on the serological cross-reactivity between these two pathogens have shown that DENV-reactive sera may promote ADE for ZIKV. This finding was first obtained in the human myeloid cell line U937, which is resistant to infection with DENV in the absence of ADE. In particular, U937 became permissive to ZIKV, when the virus was pre-incubated with a pool of convalescent sera for DENV. These results indicate the possibility that pre-existent immunity to DENV results in increased ZIKV replication, which could be related to the epidemics and pathological effects currently noted in the Americas (Dejnirattisai et al.2016; Priyamvada et al.2016). Future studies should focus on the evaluation of ADE during transplacental infection with ZIKV.",

            "text": "Viruses may affect the ability of trophoblasts to migrate and invade uterine tissue. HCMV is one of the most studied pathogens in utero in this field of study. HCMV infection inhibits the proliferation and invasion of an EVT cell line (SGHPL-4), probably because of reduction in the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP-2 and MMP-9, two key enzymes in the migration and invasion of EVTs (LaMarca et al.2006). Importantly, HCMV infection has also been studied in villous explants and EVT primary cultures obtained from women who tested negative for HCMV IgM in peripheral blood and who decided to interrupt their pregnancy during the first trimester (5 to 10 weeks) (Liu et al.2011a,b). In these models too, HCMV infection inhibited the invasive capacity of EVTs, which was associated with reduction of MMP-2, MMP-9 and c-erbB-2 protein levels and loss of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity (Liu et al.2011a,b, 2015). Liu et al. (2015) proposed that this effect could be due to an HCMV-mediated increase in the levels of transforming growth factor-\u03b21, a molecule that can inhibit the expression of both MMPs. Furthermore, they found that HCMV infection downregulates the expression of Smad-7, the main negative regulator of transforming growth factor-\u03b21, which could enhance the inhibitory effect on MMPs (Liu et al.2015). Other proposed mechanisms to explain the ability of HCMV to modulate the migration and invasion of trophoblasts contemplate its ability to alter the expression or functionality of receptors and signaling molecules that are important in the regulation of these processes, such as cytokines and their receptors. In particular, HMCV infection causes decrease in the protein levels of c-erbB-2, a common receptor of EVT related to invasion, and integrin \u03b11\u03b21, which participates in the invasion process (Fisher et al.2000; Liu et al.2011a,b, 2015). Furthermore, HCMV infection has been found to induce the transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in primary EVTs and in a cell line derived from EVT (HIPEC), favoring the expression of key genes for viral replication (IE2) and significantly affecting the invasive capacity of these cells (Rauwel et al.2010).",

In addition, HCMV infection induces the production of other cytokines such as interleukin-10 in CTBs isolated from first-trimester placentas. In contrast, HCMV infection induces the production of other cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) in CTBs isolated from first-trimester placentas. CMV infection reduces the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in fibroblasts and vascular endothelium cell lines. Particularly, IL-10 human and its viral analogue cmvIL-10 reduced the migration of endothelial cells in \u2018wound healing\u2019 assays and also decreased the invasive capacity of CTBs in matrigel assays (Yamamoto-Tabata et al.2004). All these phenomena induced by HCMV infection could affect the ability of trophoblasts to remodel the uterine vasculature. Furthermore, in vitro, uterine microvascular endothelial cells infected with HCMV transmit the infection to invasive CTBs, suggesting a role for the uterine vasculature in virus transmission (Maidji et al.2002).",

The discovery of the potential teratogenic effect of ZIKV on development in humans has focused research back on processes related to the ability of viruses to infect the maternal\u2013fetal interface. Throughout evolution, the host cell and diverse viruses have been engaged in a constant battle for viral subsistence or infection resolution. These pathogens develop different mechanisms to control certain cellular processes. The trophoblast is an important component of the placenta; different viruses try to enter trophoblasts and manipulate its machinery to generate viral factories that would help spread the infection to the fetal circulation.",

However, other cell types within this microenvironment may be susceptible to viral infection. Vertical infection with some viruses such as HCMV at the maternal\u2013fetal interface has been studied in detail. Studies on emerging viruses such as ZIKV could help provide models for obtaining knowledge regarding molecular mechanisms underlying viral interaction with the placenta and might help explain the pathogenesis of different disorders observed in virus-infected pregnant women. This minireview provides an overall view of placental infection in the case of many viruses and the main pathogenic mechanisms involved, which would be valuable for identifying common mechanisms and processes of viruses and help study infection by unexplored viruses such as chikungunya and respiratory syncytial virus at the maternal\u2013fetal interface.",

The chorionic villus has a polarized epithelium of CTB anchored to a basal membrane. The floating villi is formed by CTB that fuse to form a group of multinucleated cells known as STB; whereas, the anchoring villi will be formed by aggregates of CTBs which organize into EVT. The EVT invades the maternal decidua and begins the replacement of the endothelial lineage that coats the uterine veins and arteries, inducing the formation of a hybrid of maternal and fetal circulation.
