There are a variety of DNA amplification techniques used to increase the quantity of target DNA fragments for diagnostics. One commonly used method of DNA amplification is PCR. This technique works by using three different temperatures to amplify the DNA 1. Due to the restrictions that the temperature cycling needed to run PCR places on equipment and experimental setup, there has been an emphasis on developing DNA amplification techniques that can be performed at one temperature, or isothermally. Isothermal techniques to note are loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), rolling circle amplification, and nucleic acid sequence\u2010based amplification. Rolling circle amplification works with a single stranded, circular DNA template and strand displacing DNA polymerase 2. The DNA polymerase performs strand\u2010displacing synthesis on the ssDNA and \u2018rolls\u2019 out a copy of the circular DNA under isothermal conditions 2, 3. Nucleic acid sequence\u2010based amplification is also executed under isothermal conditions but is a transcription\u2010based amplification procedure that copies single stranded RNA or DNA sequences 2, 4. Two RNA primers and three enzymes are used, and the procedure includes both an initiation phase and an amplification phase to create the final amplification product 2. Although these methods perform well under isothermal conditions, the focus of this mathematical model analysis is LAMP.",

The primers include forward and backward inner primers (FIP and BIP), outer primers (F3 and B3), and loop primers. A detailed schematic of the LAMP process is outlined in Fig. 1. The LAMP process begins with a double stranded DNA template (Step 1). Next, the Bst DNA polymerase enzyme used in this reaction causes strand displacement by the forward inner primer (FIP) primer hybridizing F2 to the primer binding site at F2c (Step 2) 5. The inner primers are made up of two parts, one with the sense (5\u2032 to 3\u2032) and one with the antisense (3\u2032 to 5\u2032) strand complementary to the template DNA 5. Strand displacing DNA polymerase separates the dsDNA and creates a new copy of the template DNA starting from the inner primer 5. Hybridization of the forward outer primer (F3) to its respective primer binding site (F3c) then creates another new copy of the template while displacing the ssDNA created from the inner primer (Step 3) 5. Nucleotides are added to the F3 3\u2032 end which releases the single strand of DNA including the FIP primer and the F1 and F1c sites are bound together using hydrogen bonds, creating a self\u2010hybridizing, single\u2010stranded loop (Step 4). This is then used as a template to repeat this process on the opposite end of the DNA structure with new, corresponding backward inner and outer primers, culminating in the production of a dumbbell structure (Steps 5\u20137) 5.",

A new FIP primer binds to the F2c primer binding site (Step 9) and a new strand of DNA makes a copy of the stem and loop structure which creates a new loop between B1c and B1 primer binding sites (Step 10). Lastly, nucleotides are added to the 3\u2032 end of DNA structure again which releases the newly created strand of DNA which will fold into a dumbbell structure and new stem and loop LAMP structure is also created which has an additional target sequence from the previous structure (Step 11). The newly created stem and loop DNA structure is used as another template for LAMP cycling using one inner primer at a time, either FIP or BIP 5. The overall result of LAMP can make 109 copies of the target DNA when starting from a few copies within an hour 5. This efficient amplification is a major advantage of LAMP, as well as its ability to produce these DNA copies all under isothermal conditions.",

A positive LAMP reaction indicates that the target DNA sequence, representing a disease or other diagnosis such as human influenza viruses H1 or H3 9, has been amplified, and therefore identified in that sample. A negative LAMP reaction indicates that the sample does not contain that target sequence since it has not been identified and amplified in the reaction, therefore leading to a negative reaction and a negative diagnosis. Here, the focus is on better understanding the DNA structures that are created through this amplification technique since, unlike PCR, DNA copies created through LAMP are dissimilar in size. This investigation is done using mathematical modeling to predict the size of different DNA structures produced through LAMP using gel or microchip electrophoresis.",

This new mathematical model makes it possible to instead predict the banding pattern associated with positive LAMP samples during gel electrophoresis.

Since the stem and loop structures created through LAMP are complex in nature, creating this simple tool can be relatively difficult 11. In conventional PCR, researchers can predict the output DNA sizes of their amplified product in a true\u2010positive reaction based on the location of the forward and reverse primers on the template DNA. The complexity of the LAMP process has not allowed for that same predictive method. However, this mathematical model is a new tool that now allows researchers to make those same predictions for the sizes of the different amplified products produced through a true\u2010positive LAMP reaction based on the target and primer sizes. Similar to recognizing true\u2010positive reactions on gel electrophoresis plots for PCR, this model allows researchers to quickly recognize true\u2010positive and false\u2010positive amplification for LAMP because they will know what the correct banding pattern should be. Thus, if the gel electrophoresis plot shows an alternative banding pattern, the researchers can identify the sample as a false\u2010positive which can help to reduce the likelihood of an incorrect diagnosis. Current methods to reduce the chance of false\u2010positive LAMP reactions include optimizing LAMP reactions using multiple runs and techniques to find true positive results 12, 13 or using more intricate methods such as molecular beacons that only fluoresce when bound to target DNA or restriction enzyme digestions 5, 9, 14. Overall, this mathematical model helps to create a predictive method for researchers to implement into their LAMP experimental design that is of no extra cost to them, uses information already gathered during LAMP primer designing, and reduces the likelihood of false\u2010positive diagnosis.",

            "text": "The overall process of creating this model involved transforming the qualitative LAMP structure into a quantitative LAMP structure size. The first step of the model development was to identify how many times different primer binding sequences (F1, F2, F3, B1, B2, B3) appeared in the final LAMP product. This was important so that the size (bp) of each of these sequences could be multiplied by the number of times they appear in the final structure resulting in the overall structure size. Figure 1 shows that regardless of the number of target sequences, the final LAMP product will contain the same four primer binding sites: F1, F2, B1, and B2. Additionally, the sequences Fspace (sequence between F1 and F2 sequences in forward inner primer), and Bspace (sequence between B1 and B2 sequences in backward inner primer) will be in every final structure. Lastly, every LAMP structure will contain a specified amount of target sequences. The number of times each of these seven components appear in a LAMP structure is important when predicting the overall size. Therefore, different LAMP structures were evaluated to count the number of times each of these parts were found. Figure 1 was used for analyzing the Stem and Loop \u00d71 and Stem and Loop \u00d72 structures, and additional LAMP schematics by Notomi et al. 5 were used for structures up to Stem and Loop \u00d77 which contains 7 target sequences. Table 2 breaks down this quantitative analysis to show a population count for how many times each primer binding site, Fspace, Bspace, and target appears in each structure. These counts are consistent between any LAMP structures, irrespective of the diagnostic application. As amplification occurs, each cycle adds one target sequence and one primer binding site\u2013either FIP (F1 and F2) or BIP (B1 and B2), depending on the structure that was amplified. Due to the self\u2010hybridizing loop that appears in the stem and loop structures, the addition of new primer binding sites during each amplification cycle can be complex to understand, therefore making Table 2 helpful in determining how many times each primer binding site appears for any given structure.",

This information is easily and immediately available to the user when creating specific LAMP primers. Using Fig. 2 for example, this shows the location of different primer binding sites in the target sequence so that each component of the LAMP structure can be identified, and the number of base pairs contained in that component can be counted. Then, in the final equations that calculate the overall structure sizes (bp) in this model, each of the individual primer binding site sizes will be inputted to the respective variable. One assumption made in this model is that the loops created in stem and loop structures are considered base pairs in this size estimation although they are single stranded nucleotides. Ultimately, following individual derivation for each component of the LAMP structure, two master equations are outputted: one that predicts the LAMP structure size (bp) with an odd number of target sequences (Equation (4)) and one that predicts the LAMP structure size (bp) with an even number of target sequences (Equation (5)).

            "text": "Results of optimization testing showed that running the experiment at 67\u00b0C created the largest amount of product (Fig. 3A). This optimized temperature can be explained by the melting temperature (Tm) of the FIP and BIP primers. At 70\u00b0C and 72.2\u00b0C, respectively, the temperature at which they anneal for amplification will be around 5\u00b0C below the Tm. Therefore, the range for the annealing temperature is between 65\u00b0C and 67.2\u00b0C, which includes the optimized temperature 15. The time optimization testing showed that the Bioanalyzer was able to analyze the amount of LAMP product produced after running the reaction for 30 minutes (Fig. 3B). A reason for this is that at 30 minutes, the amount of amplified DNA was now above the threshold of what the Bioanalyzer machine could recognize. Additionally, adding the heat inactivation step for the Bst enzyme at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes helped to stop the reaction and, most likely, reduce the amount of secondary DNA structures which were interfering with the most prominent LAMP products during the control experiments. This heat inactivation step is not required for LAMP experiments but was important in this application to ensure the reaction was completely stopped after 30 minutes. The control procedure used as a comparison to the optimized assay was obtained from the WarmStart\u00ae LAMP Kit (DNA & RNA) specifications (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Figure 3C shows the difference in the total concentration of product produced between the control and final assays where an unpaired T\u2010test indicated a statistically significant difference in these results. This is the optimal LAMP assay for our application because there is a statistically significant larger amount of total DNA produced compared to the control, there are fewer distinct peaks based on base pair size as compared to the control (data not shown), and it was run in the shortest amount of time possible to still produce a substantial amount of amplified DNA. An electropherogram of the typical result of this LAMP reaction using the first set of primers (FIP\u20101, BIP\u20101, F3\u20101, B3\u20101) is seen in Fig. 3D.",

This process began with identifying the size and location of each primer and the number of nucleotides between them within the M13mp18 template DNA for the first primer set (Fig. 2 and Table 1). This information was readily available in the software used for LAMP primer design, so this did not create an extra evaluation step to use this model. Table 3 provides the given variable and corresponding base pair size for this first primer set and the outcome predicted DNA structure sizes exported from the mathematical model are listed under \u2018Predicted Size (bp)\u2019 in Table 4. When comparing the difference between the predicted size and the average structure size, 100% of the bp differences fell within this accepted range for each structure. The predicted versus actual structures sizes were also graphed and, using an unpaired T\u2010test, it was determined that six of the seven structures sizes did not have a statistically significant difference between the predicted and actual sizes, which is expected (Fig. 4A). Although, one structure did show a statistically significant difference between the predicted and actual values, seven out of the seven compared structures had a difference that was less than that of the sensitivity of the Bioanalyzer, which indicated the success of the predictions (Fig. 4A).

Copy number values are calculated based on the assumption that the average base pair weight is 650 Daltons. The same information from Table 3 for the first primer set and Predicted Sizes from Table 4 were used to assess the results of these experiments. In each of the three concentration groups, it was found that the Stem and Loop \u00d73 structure fell outside of the sensitivity of the Bioanalyzer with an average peak size of 345 bp for 50 ng, 344 bp for 200 ng, and 341 bp for 400 ng of input DNA where the predicted size is 367 bp with a sensitivity range of 18.35 bp. The Stem and Loop \u00d73 structure was also the only structure in the optimized LAMP primers testing to show a statistically significant difference between the predicted and actual values. One reason this specific structure may result in product sizes further from the predicted value is due to incomplete elongation of a new LAMP structure. This could be caused by annealing between alternatively inverted repeats in the same strand of DNA which would explain why the results show a slightly smaller size for this structure.",

The same predicted sizes from Table 4 were also used in this testing analysis. The result of adding the loop primers showed that 100% of the LAMP structures still fell within the range of the Bioanalyzer sensitivity, results are presented in Table 5. The only significant difference when using the loop primer mix was that each of these reactions also showed a peak on the electropherograms around 75 bp which is hypothesized to be caused by a primer dimer formation, caused by primers binding to themselves and amplifying. One reason why a primer dimer may be found when using the loop primer mix is because there is now a larger concentration of LAMP primers starting in the reaction, therefore it is possible that some may bind to each other, rather than existing LAMP structures.",

An example electropherogram of this data is presented in Fig. 5A and a graphical comparison of the predict and experimentally determined structure sizes is provided in Fig. 5B. Using these primers, only one of the structures showed no statistical significance for the difference between the predicted and actual value using an unpaired T\u2010test. This variation is to be expected though, because the experiment was not optimized for these primers and therefore the difference in the mean base pair sizes of the structures may be further apart than if the experiment was optimized.

This provided the input values for the mathematical model to make the size predictions. Additionally, there was a gel electrophoresis plot to compare the mathematically derived predictions to so that there could be an evaluation regarding whether the model worked or not. A benefit of using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 for this study is that exact base pair values were exported for every peak, for every LAMP sample. In other literature on LAMP, most studies are not analyzed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, but with standard gel electrophoresis, therefore experimental values are written as an approximation if not otherwise specified by the author of that study. Even LAMP experiments analyzed with a Bioanalyzer did not provide exact sizes for the banding pattern. Overall, it was determined that the predicted sizes outputted from the mathematical model fall within the same accepted error range used in the previous testing.

Mfold is used to predict the folding and hybridization of single stranded nucleic acids 16. This was an important analytical tool because it was able to validate that the LAMP structures predicted from the DNA sequences in the mathematical model were also the most thermodynamically likely DNA structures. Input settings for the modeling software were a folding temperature at 67\u00b0C and Mg2+ concentration of 8 mM based on the composition of the LAMP WarmStart Mix being used in this reaction. From this technology the most likely structure was determined by the minimum \u0394G (kcal/mol) or Gibbs free energy. \u0394G is the amount of energy capable of doing work during a reaction where temperature and pressure are constant 17. If \u0394G is a negative number, it releases free energy and the reaction is exergonic, and if the \u0394G is positive it gains free energy and is an endergonic reaction 17. Equation (6) is used in the calculations for the thermodynamics of folding. Where \u0394H is the change in enthalpy, T is temperature, and \u0394S is the change in entropy.\n(6)\u0394G=\u0394H\u2212T\u0394S\n",

The simple 2\u2010state model means that the nucleic acid sequence is either folded in the configuration shown, or entirely single stranded 16. According to Zuker, to test the 2\u2010state model, the sequences can be refolded, using MFold, near the respective predicted T\nm values, and if the new T\nm is \u2018significantly\u2019 larger than the original, this would imply that the molecule can be refolded into another geometry at a larger T\nm\n16. To test whether these structures could be refolded into another geometry, the stem and loop and stem and loop \u00d72 sequences were rerun using MFold under the same conditions other than a new temperature setting at 95\u00b0C. The T\nm values of the stem and loop and stem and loop \u00d72 structures during the first test were 95.2 and 97.8\u00b0C, respectively. These temperatures were near to the final heating temperature used experimentally, 95\u00b0C, so this temperature was selected for the new testing. The software results showed that both structures maintained the same thermodynamic folding with only a slight change in T\nm. The stem and loop structure now had a \u0394G of \u22123.19 kcal/mol at 95\u00b0C and T\nm of 96.2\u00b0C. The stem and loop \u00d72 structure had a \u0394G of \u22124.22 kcal/mol at 97.8\u00b0C and a T\nm of 96.2\u00b0C. Due to the complexities of the LAMP structures and size constraints from the MFold modeling software, these were the only structures tested. However, this theoretical analysis strongly indicates that the predicted structures using DNA base pair size analysis are consistent with what is most likely to happen thermodynamically during single stranded nucleic acid folding and hybridization.",

As LAMP has found a strong niche in diagnostic applications, it is essential that it is used accurately, and false\u2010positive diagnosis is avoided. This mathematical model can be used as a tool to easily validate positive diagnostic results using any set of LAMP primers because the correct banding pattern on a gel electrophoresis plot can now be predicted. Additionally, this model provides scientists with a stronger understanding of the various DNA structures being produced in their LAMP experiment. This model was validated using two sets of LAMP primers with 100% of the average DNA base pair sizes appearing within an accepted error margin of the LAMP predictions according to the sensitivity of the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 device. The model was also tested using different DNA concentrations, using loop primers, and using previously published literature of LAMP experiments with a similar level of accuracy. This model helps to fill a gap in the current LAMP research and provides an easy\u2010to\u2010use tool to efficiently and accurately identify a true\u2010positive LAMP reaction which can reduce false\u2010positive diagnosis.",
