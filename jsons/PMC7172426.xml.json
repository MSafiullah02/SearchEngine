When disease severity and responsiveness to treatment are added to this categorization, the number of variations becomes very large. If these manifestations are controlled by specific genes and environmental interactions, then the true complexity of this disease becomes appreciated.",

Thus a disease that has a strong genetic component will show a higher rate of concordance in MZ than in DZ twins. In a large survey of 7000 twin pairs, concordance rates for asthma, eczema, and hay fever were all substantially higher for MZ than for DZ twins.15 This observation has also been shown for BHR, SPT responses, and serum total and specific IgE.16, 17 In a study deliberately designed to disaggregate genetic from environmental effects, both allergic disease and partial phenotypes were compared in MZ and DZ twins reared together and apart.18 Whether together or separated, MZ twins showed a greater concordance than DZ twins, indicative of a strong genetic contribution. This has been further strengthened by the findings in a recent 11,688 Danish twin pairs with use of additive and genetic and nonshared environmental modeling that 73% of asthma susceptibility was genetic and a substantial part of the variation liability of asthma was the result of environmental factors.19\n",

Linkage studies require families usually enriched with the disease, which must be accurately phenotyped. Depending on the approach, families can be nuclear families (ie, children and their parents), extended pedigrees, or inbred populations. Linkage analysis requires the saturation of the entire human genome at regular intervals with microsatellite markers comprising variable nucleotide tandem repeats whose precise position on the genetic map are known. Whole-genome screens use 300 to 500 dinucleotide, trinucleotide, or tetranucleotide markers spaced 5 to 10 cM across the genome. The proximity of a marker to a disease-related gene is estimated by measuring the number of recombination events between them; the closer 2 loci are, the less chance they will be separated at meiosis(Fig 2).\nThe significance of linkage is measured by the \u201clod score\u201d (log of the odds ratio of the likelihood of a hypothesis of linkage to the likelihood of a hypothesis of no linkage). For example, for a lod score of 3, there is a 5% chance of a false-positive linkage. A lod score of 2.2 is suggestive of linkage, 3.6 significant linkage, and 5.4 highly significant linkage.25\n",

This requires the construction of physical maps of the region with use of overlapping genomic DNA clones and techniques such as exon trapping and complementary DNA selection to identify genes in a given section of DNA. With the availability of integrated genetic and physical maps it is possible to obtain an inventory of genes mapping to the specified genetic interval and scan this for genes of known function (positional-candidate approach). Once a specific gene and its mutations have been identified, their expression can be assessed in diseased tissue by a combination of PCR and in situ hybridization and functional studies undertaken by overexpressing and underexpressing the gene in appropriate human cell lines and transgenic mice. At the time of writing, no candidate genes for asthma have yet been reported that have emerged from whole genome screens.",

Moreover, at least 12 common polymorphisms have also been described in the coding region of the IL-4 receptor gene on chromosome 16p12.1, 5 of which lead to amino acid changes of the gene product (Fig 3).35\nSome of these (eg, isoleucine [Ile] 50 valine [Val]) increase,36 some (eg, serine [Ser] 503 proline [Prol]) decrease37 STAT6 activation, whereas others appear to have no effect on IL-4 signalling.38 The role of glutamine (Gln) 576 arginine (Arg) is not clear.36, 38, 39 When 2 or more IL-4R polymorphisms occur together (eg, Ser 503 Prol and Gln 576 Arg, STAT6 phosphorylation is reduced and IRS1/2 phosphorylation is increased.37 If the level of IL-4 secretion is also increased (eg, in the \u2013589 promoter polymorphism), then any genetic effects mediated through the IL-4R or IL-13 receptor are likely to be magnified.",

            "text": "Another example of gene-gene interaction may occur in the leukotriene pathway. The cysteinyl leukotrienes LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 are critical mediators of airway narrowing, microvascular leakage, mucus secretion, and eosinophilia in bronchial asthma.40, 41 The terminal enzyme for cysteinyl leukotriene (Cyst-LT) synthesis is LTC4 synthase encoded on chromosome 5q35. We have shown that in patients with aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) the expression of this enzyme in mast cells and eosinophils is increased 5-fold in parallel with enhanced Cyst-LT production.42 This might explain why such patients find particular benefit from being treated with Cyst-LT1 receptor antagonists (LTRAs) such as montelukast.43 An A\u2192C polymorphism at the \u2013444 position of the LTC4 synthase promoter has been shown to be strongly associated with AIA (odds ratio 3.89).44 This base substitution creates an extra activator protein-2 transcription factor binding site, leading to increased enzyme transcription. We have also shown that the A/A or A/C allele is also found more commonly in patients with severe asthma and is accompanied by a greater ability to produce LTC4 on ex vivo activation of the peripheral blood eosinophils and a tendency toward enhanced responsiveness to the antileukotriene drug zafirlukast.45 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) is the first committed enzyme in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes. A series of naturally occurring mutations have been discovered within the glucocorticoid-rich transcription factor binding region in the promoter of the 5-LO gene.46 These involve deletion of 1, deletion of 2, or addition of 1 zinc finger (Sp1/Egr2) binding sites. When transfected, the mutant alleles result in reduced Sp1/Egr2 binding, and reporter gene transcription is reduced by 20% and 40% compared with the wild-type sequences.47 In 236 patients with asthma, only those possessing mutant 5-LO alleles were relatively resistant to treatment with the 5-LO inhibitor ABT-761; the mean FEV1 improved by ~5% compared with ~15% for the wild-type and heterozygotes.48 Thus, if there were mutations both of the cysteinyl LT4 synthase and 5-LO in favor of greater LTC4 production, then a subtype of \u201cleukotriene-dependent\u201d asthma can be envisaged. With the recent cloning and expression of the Cyst-LT1 receptor,49 variation in expression, ligand binding, or transduction signaling may further the appearance of leukotriene dependence. Such mechanisms may help explain the responder\u2013nonresponder phenomenon that is emerging in clinical studies of asthma involving LTRAs.43, 50\n",

Unfortunately, clinical trials with diet supplementation have been disappointing both with allergen provocation and in clinical asthma.61, 62, 63 However, Broughton et al64 have recently shown that only those patients who have high urine secretions of LTE4 responded favorably to omega-3 fatty PUFA dietary supplementation, whereas in those who were low excretors the asthma deteriorated or was unchanged rather than improved. Because urinary LTE4 excretion is a measure of the activity of the 5-LO pathway,39, 43 it is possible that responders and nonresponders to this dietary intervention could be determined by prior genotyping.",

The lower prevalence of allergic disease in formerly communist countries and the subsequent increase that has been observed since reunification has also been cited as supporting the \u201chygiene hypothesis\u201d of allergic disease, as has the increased urban-to-rural gradient of allergic sensitization in African communities.68 However, what is notable about the changes in prevalence being observed in the former Eastern Bloc countries and in Africa is that allergic sensitization has increased but asthma and BHR has not.69 This adds further evidence to the view that asthma and allergy are not equivalent or even linearly related and that local organ-derived factors are important. The recent description of a polymorphism of CD14, the endotoxin receptor that is linked to the development of atopy in children, is of great interest70 and will encourage a search for other candidate gene polymorphisms linked to susceptibility to early life infection, including IFN-\u03b3, natural resistance\u2013associated macrophage protein-1, natural resistance\u2013associated macrophage protein-2, and the mannose-binding protein.",

Eczema is a strong predictor of asthma persistence and, in chronic severe disease, there is evidence for gastrointestinal epithelial permeability and inflammation. Therefore the epithelium may play a particularly important role in directing the inflammatory and remodeling responses in chronic allergic disease. Subepithelial deposition of interstitial (repair) collagens, impaired epithelial proliferative responses to damage, enhanced inflammatory and cytokine growth factor secretion, and evidence for altered subepithelial myofibroblast function in asthma suggest a fundamental abnormality in the epithelial-mesenchymal trophic unit that is involved in fetal lung development.71, 72 Abnormal signaling between the epithelium and myofibroblast and to dendritic cells provides a basis for asthma that encapsulates both TH2 polarization and airway wall remodeling. Whether this hypothesis can be sustained will require research at the gene by environment interface and its application to disease as it occurs in humans.",
