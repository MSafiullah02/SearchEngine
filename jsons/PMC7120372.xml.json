Thus, DALY is thought of as one lost year of healthy life (Mathers et al., 2007) (Table\n66-1).\n",

Considering a broader definition of development that supplement income by other components like levels of health and education, the United Nations have developed five main composite indices to measure the average achievements in basic human development (human development index (HDI)), gender-related development index (GDI), 10.1007/978-0-387-78665-0_5842. HDI is the most used index giving a summary measure of human development, allowing a yearly comparison between countries around the world and indicating the relative ranking evolution in time of each country. HDI is a three dimensional composite index obtained as a mean of three indicators weighed equally: health (life expectancy at birth), standard of living (GDP per capita) and education (literacy and enrolment) (UNDP, 2006).",

In Africa and especially in countries with high 10.1007/978-0-387-78665-0_6417 of HIV/AIDS, devastating consequences are already strikingly apparent not only on health systems and health indicators but also in terms of income and productivity, education and knowledge, human rights and gender equality (UNAIDS, 2006). Nearly 80% of the 3 million global deaths from HIV/AIDS that occurred by the end of 2002 were in sub-Saharan Africa, dramatically cutting life expectancy and leaving a legacy of millions of orphans. Seven countries had a prevalence of HIV over 20% (UN, 2004).",

Unfortunately, malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases in general, are reversing the trend towards the achievement of universal primary education in most African countries. In Africa, less than 65% of children are enrolled in primary school and thousands of enrolled children will prematurely leave school under the pressure of infectious diseases, including orphans, disabled, impoverished and those who withdraw to look after ill members of their families (UNICEF, 2005; UNAIDS, 2006; UNESCO, 2007) (Table\n66-8). During the period 1999\u20132004, orphaned children represented 12.3% of all children under age 18 in sub-Saharan Africa and the percentage of child labour reached 41% in West and Central Africa (UNICEF, 2005). More globally, these diseases are seen to have a four-fold impact on education. They affect the cognitive ability of children, the capacity of teachers, the upbringing of families and the efficiency of staff and managers. For instance, HIV prevalence among South African teachers reaches 21% among those aged 25\u201334 and 13% among those aged 35\u201344, whereas in the Zambian school system, over 60% of teacher absence is due to HIV/AIDS (illness, care for ill family members, family funeral, etc..)

For health strategies to be successful, international solidarity and public-private partnerships are needed to tackle the problems of shortage and lack of treatments, resistance and the need for new drugs, vaccines and diagnostic procedures. In this direction, several programmes have already been launched such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFFATM), Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), The medicines for Malaria Ventures (MMV), the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance), The Human Hookworm Vaccine initiative (HHVI), the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), the Drug for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), Stop TB, Roll back Malaria, etc\u2026. However, this global strategy is insufficient without the national and local implication. Health decision makers, non governmental organizations (NGOs), research institutions, community groups and individuals must join their efforts in order to attenuate the incidences of specific diseases, control the spread of epidemics and development of complications, and optimise the health management of human and material resources.",

The objective fixed by WHO and its partners to provide 3 million people in developing countries with antiretroviral therapy by the end of 2005 was far to be reached, suggesting that more effort and efficient measures are needed. It is also hoped that combined efforts between donor nations and affected countries will provide the US$2\u20133 billion per year required to scale up the response against malaria in endemic areas. Similarly, although 16 million patients have been treated so far with the WHO-recommended directly observed therapy strategy (DOTS), yet more than half of those affected by tuberculosis still do not have access to this treatment, especially those living in the Nine African countries the most affected by tuberculosis. However, an indisputable economic benefit is predicted from a sustained DOTS and global plan strategy as indicated by the World Bank report (Laxminarayan et al., 2007). A recent cost-benefit analysis by WHO showed that achieving the global MDG target in water and sanitation would bring substantial economic gain in both health and other benefits (consequences of reduction in diarrheal episodes): each $1 invested would yield an economic return between $3 and $34 depending on region. The health-related costs avoided would reach $7.3 billion per year, and the annual value of adult working days gained as a result of less illness would be almost $750 million.",
