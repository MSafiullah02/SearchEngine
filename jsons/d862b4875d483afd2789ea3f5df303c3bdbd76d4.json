            "text": "There are certain clinical events or manifestations that require modifying the initial antimicrobial therapy; for example, if a patient has breakthrough bacteremia and if Gram-positive is isolated (add vancomycin especially if there is a risk of MRSA or pneumococcal resistance penicillin). If Gram-negative organism is isolated consider resistant Gram-negative and can change the regimen or broaden the coverage (carbapenems if the data in the center showed that the carbapenems has better sensitivity than cephalosporin or beta-lactam antibiotic). If the patient has catheter-associated soft tissue infection, vancomycin should be added. Patients with severe oral mucositis or necrotizing gingivitis are at risk of anaerobic bacteria as well as viruses; add agent that is active against beta-lactamase-producing anaerobic bacteria including clindamycin, metronidazole, and acyclovir should be considered. If the patient has diffuse pneumonia, continue with the broad-spectrum anti-Gramnegative coverage (add trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and macrolide to the therapy). Increasing neutrophil count on patients who developed new infiltrates while on antibiotic can be related to the recovery of neutropenia. If the patient is stable observe if the neutrophil count is not rising, antifungal therapy should be considered as the patient is at risk for fungal infection. In addition to other evaluation Aspergillus galactomannan and B-D glucan (fungitell) should be done with chest CT scan. Depending on the CT scan findings bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy should be considered. Patient with prolonged fever and neutropenia needs to be observed if recovery of neutropenia is not imminent. Antifungal therapy can include either regular amphotericin B, or lipid formulation of amphotericin B including liposomal amphotericin B (amBisome) or amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC), caspofungin or voriconazole depending of the availability of medications and epidemiology of the institution.",
