While the proximate mechanisms of these anthropogenic changes are well studied (e.g., climate change, biodiversity loss, population growth), the evolutionary causality of these anthropogenic changes have been largely ignored. Anthroecological theory (AET) proposes that the ultimate cause of anthropogenic environmental change is multi-level selection for niche construction and ecosystem engineering. Here, we integrate this theory with Lotka's Maximum Power Principle and propose a model linking energy extraction from the environment with genetic, technological and cultural evolution to increase human ecosystem carrying capacity. Carrying capacity is partially determined by energetic factors such as the net energy a population can acquire from its environment and the efficiency of conversion from energy input to offspring output. These factors are under Darwinian genetic selection in all species, but in humans, they are also determined by technology and culture. If there is genetic or non-genetic heritable variation in the ability of an individual or social group to increase its carrying capacity, then we hypothesize that selection or cultural evolution will act to increase carrying capacity. Furthermore, if this evolution of carrying capacity occurs faster than the biotic components of the ecological system can respond via their own evolution, then we hypothesize that unsustainable ecological changes will result.",

            "text": "Since the neolithic demographic transition, human societies have often lived along a continuum of unsustainability (Ponting 2007; Gowdy and Krall 2013) , as depicted in Fig. 1 . 1 At the most extreme end of this continuum is socio-ecological \"collapse\", defined here as a rapid decline in the population and/or development of a society due to a combination of ecological and social factors (Cumming and Peterson 2017) . Civilizations that may have experienced socio-ecological collapse in whole or part due to their over-extraction of resources include the Mayans, Romans, Greeks, the civilizations of Easter and Pitcairn Islands, the Norse colony in Greenland, the Cahokia in the American Midwest, and the Anasazi (Lopinot and Woods 1993; Ponting 2007; Hughes 2011; Kennett and Beach 2013) . In these cases, human systems may have expanded beyond their ability to absorb energy and materials from the environment, and these resource constraints interacted with socio-political conflict to generate socio-ecological collapse. The precise mechanisms and the relative weight of social versus ecological factors is debated in these and other cases (Butzer 2012; Butzer and Endfield 2012; Boersema 2015; Cumming and Peterson 2017) , and we do not imply that every case of social collapse is primarily resource driven. Instead, we simply note that human populations have repeatedly experienced collapse and in many of these cases, environmental and resource constraints are implicated.",

We define socio-ecological crisis as a situation in which human populations have expanded close to or beyond their ability to gather energy and materials from their environment which imperils the population and its standard of living. 2 Socio-ecological crisis may lead to the collapse, but societies might also be resilient. Examples of socio-ecological crisis might include the 1828 years (out of 2000) between 108 BCE and 1910 CE in which there was a famine in at least one province in China; the European famine of 1315-17 in which the population resorted to cannibalism; or the Finish famine of 1696-97 in which a quarter of the population perished (Ponting 2007) . In each case, crisis did not lead to collapse, but for our purposes, it is only important that so much of recorded human history has been spent in a state of crisis.",

We define unsustainability as a growth phase in which humans extract increasing quantities of energy and materials from the environment and use them for both maintenance and growth. Unsustainability is associated both with economic (Daly 1991) and population growth (Ehrlich and Ehrlich 2009 ) and may lead to socio-ecological crisis. We might consider the growth phase of the ancient Greek (Hughes 2011) or contemporary Western civilizations to exist in a state of unsustainability. Given our history and our contemporary society, we might wonder why human civilization, since the neolithic revolution seems to be dominated by periods of unsustainability punctuated with periods of socio-ecological crisis and collapse (Ponting 2007; Gowdy and Krall 2013) ? The purpose of this paper is to provide a conceptual model for understanding why humans may be predisposed to environmental unsustainability, socio-ecological crisis, and collapse.",

In this understanding, humans have acted as ecosystem engineers and niche builders since at least the agricultural revolution, and perhaps since their burning of ancient savannahs for corralling game.

Lotka argued that natural selection acted so that organisms sought to maximize the rate at which it extracted energy from the environment; H.T. Odum later named this hypothesis the maximum power principle (Sciubba 2011) . If Lotka was correct, then the ecosystem engineering and niche construction described by AET can be understood as a consequence of the maximum power principle acting via natural selection. While this energetic view is similar to Ellis's AET model, we use energy extraction as a target of selection and as a metric of environmental load. This formalization might allow novel tests and models of AET. In the remainder of the paper, we first review the available literature on the evolution of unsustainability including prior approaches from agriculture, evolutionary psychology, and AET. We then describe our conceptual model of energetic AET and its relationship to the evolution of carrying capacity. Finally, we discuss the implications of energetic AET for our understanding of two contemporary issues in socio-ecology and the paper ends with conclusions.",

To Gowdy and Krall, the ultra-social nature of human groups allowed for a shift in the primary level of selection from the individual level to the group level. Thus, \"With the transition to agriculture the group as an adaptive unit comes to constitute a wholly different gestalt driven by the imperative to produce surplus (Gowdy and Krall 2014, 139) .\" This imperative to produce surplus leads to environmental crisis in Gowdy and Krall's model, but the same phenotype could also be understood as an expression of Lotka's maximum power principle in our model.",

In is 1798, An Essay on the Principle of Population, Malthus observed that population grew exponentially, while improvements in agricultural yields grew linearly at most (Malthus and Pullen 1989) . The result was what has been called a Malthusian catastrophe in which the human demand for food energy exceeds our ability to extract it from the environment with consequent decreases in population size, standard of living, or both. Phrased in the language of the present paper, Malthus argued that the rate of increase of energy extraction from the environment was principally resource (rather than technology) limited and that this resulted in socio-ecological crisis when the rate of population growth exceeded the rate of energy extraction growth.",

Thus, we seek to build a conceptual evolutionary model of the human socio-ecological system that is consistent with these insights from agricultural systems but is more evolutionary and more general and incorporates extra-somatic energy, defined as energy that is used by humans but not used in direct human metabolism (Price 1995) . Furthermore, we propose a positive feedback that is missing from prior models of the energetics of socioecological systems, and we also integrate a ratchet-effect that causes the evolution of humans towards socio-ecological crisis to be unidirectional. Where Gowdy and Krall (2013, 2014) saw agriculture as the key to understanding human unsustainability, Van Vugt et al. (2014) saw the roots of unsustainability in the paleolithic, before the invention of agriculture. Using an evolutionary psychological approach, Van Vugt et al. argued that ancestral selection in paleolithic humans created psychological conditions that make humans ill prepared to living sustainably. For example, they argue that relative values-valuing status rather than absolute quantities of goods-would have been adaptive in prehistory, but has become maladaptive for sustainability in the contemporary world. In the present paper, we understand the traits described by Van Vugt et al. (2014) as pre-adaptations that are exploited by cultural evolution.",

In AET, this process results in a species that is prone to niche construction and ecosystem engineering, and the scale of these processes continues to increase as the population rises. This increasing scale coupled with human propensity for niche construction leads to human unsustainability (Ellis 2015; Ellis et al. 2018) .",

That is, niche construction and ecosystem engineering are two possible mechanisms by which humans maximize their extraction of energy from the environment. Because the substrate of this evolution is cultural and technological as well as genetic, it outpaces the ability of the ecological system to evolutionarily respond.

Here, we adapt the Red Queen to include coevolution between a species (humans) and the biotic components of the ecosystem (the biosphere). Thus, we hypothesize that as human population size increases, human populations demand more energy from the environment. This places a selective pressure on the biotic environment, because energetic resources are limited and because of the 2nd law of thermodynamics, energetic resources are zero-sum; that is, if humans consume energy from the environment, there is necessarily less energy available for other organisms. However, the human population evolves via techno-cultural evolution, which is far faster than the biotic environment can evolve via genetic evolution. Thus, the analogy between a fast-evolving parasite (humans) and a slow-evolving host (the biotic environment) is apt. Note that we do not intend to imply that the environment itself coevolves with human techno-cultural evolution, but that the biotic populations that compose the ecosystem evolve, with consequent impacts on the abiotic environment (but see Lovelock and Margulis 1974 , Levin 1998 , Swenson et al. 2000 .",

Humans, just like all other species, maximize their energy extraction from the environment. Just like all other species, humans are opposed in this process by a coevolutionary response in the biotic components of the ecosystem. Humans are unique only, because the rate of cultural evolution in energy extraction exceeds our biotic environment's coevolutionary response. In this view, human unsustainability is a result of our uniquely advanced culture coupled with our non-unique drive towards for energy maximization; any species that developed a similar rate of cultural evolution would behave similarly.

In this model, fitness is on the individual level, but identical logic applies at the group level, assuming heritable group variation in X or E. This physiological understanding of fitness is tautological when applied to non-humans, because the only source of energy non-human organisms use is somatic. For example, applied to a lion, Eq. 1 simply argues that the lion's offspring number is the total number of calories it eats multiplied by its offspring number divided by the number of calories it eats. However, both X and E can be selected independently, given heritable variation. That is, lions could be selected for better foraging ability (increased total energy gain from the environment), or for more efficient foraging, digestion, metabolism, etc. (increased efficiency). Unlike non-humans, humans can use extra-somatic energy sources (e.g., fossil fuels), and can convert those energy sources into genetic fitness. For example, humans can burn savannas to harvest game (Scherjon et al. 2015) , burn forests to create terra preta (Glaser et al. 2001) , and reform fossil fuels to create fertilizer; all of these uses of energy use non-trophic energy to indirectly increase fitness.

We hypothesize that humans have been preferentially selected to maximize X rather than E, that this is the cause of our predilection for socio-ecological crisis, and that this preferential selection on X occurs because of thermodynamic limits on the change in E. Furthermore, even selection for increased resource efficiency can lead to increased environmental impacts. As resources are more efficiently converted into fitness, population size increases which in turns leads to increased absolute resource use.

This might apply both to indirect material indicators of energy gain (e.g., objects) as well as direct physical indicators of energy gain [e.g., body mass as an indicator of male attractiveness (Swami and Tov\u00e9e 2005) ]. Of course, the aggregate accumulation of material possessions and status comes at an environmental cost. We use energy and materials to create and obtain status bearing objects (cars, houses, jewelry, clothes, etc.), and this resource use results in high entropy wastes output to the environment. Thus, one way to understand our socio-ecological crisis is as a result of ancestral selection acting at the individual level and favoring social dominance expressed via the accumulation of embodied energy (Odum 1996) .

As in Eq. 1, the fitness of the group is a function of the group's ability to extract energy from the environment and the group efficiency of conversion. For example, groups of hunter-gatherers that hunt more effectively due to genetic mutations in social intelligence might be selected over groups without such traits, even if the trait exhibits a cost at the individual level.

This is identical to the claim that social organization exists to maximize the fitness of the group (Wilson and Sober 1994) and/or the individuals which compose the group (Nowak et al. 2010) , given an energetic definition of fitness. What is unique is the implication. If social organization acts to maximize group fitness (or the fitness of individual group members), and if fitness is dependent on energy extraction from the environment, then social organization results in increasing energy extraction from the environment. Again, either increased X or E leads to environmental unsustainability, and thus social organization is an evolutionary cause of the socioecological crisis.",

However, selection is not limited to genetic transmission. Cultural group selection posits that culture, rather than genes, is the source of heritable variation on which selection acts at the human group level. Because there are differences in the transmissibility and variance generation between cultural and genetic inheritance, the maintenance of cultural variation across groups is more plausible (Henrich 2004; Bell et al. 2009; Waring et al. 2015) , thus the attraction of group-level cultural selection as a means of explaining human traits. Table 1 describes the levels of selection acting to create human unsustainability and speed with which they act. The strength of selection is a function of the heritable variation in a trait and the trait's association with fitness (Henrich 2004; Freeman and Herron 2007) . The speed of selection is a function of its strength and the generation time (Van Valen 1973) . Cultural group selection can be more rapid than genetic forms of selection, because cultural change does not need to wait for biological reproduction to change phenotypic ratios, and new cultural innovations can be added to the population through non-random guided mutation (Perreault 2012; Brooks et al. 2018) .",

As a result, technology might change far more quickly than natural systems can respond via natural selection (Wilson 2012) . In species without technology or a technological culture, changes in X and E will occur on evolutionary time and within a biological system that will evolve in response to any evolution. That is, in the absence of culture and technology, all of the biotic components of the system are limited to gradual changes in gene frequencies over time such that the rate of change in one species can be adapted to by another species. In humans, cultural evolution may have been too fast for other species to respond (Perreault 2012) . Thus, another way to understand our socioecological crisis is as a result of our ability to increase K by rapid, non-genetic processes. This rapid increase in technology creates an unsustainable situation in which the human system changes faster than the biotic components of the nonhuman system can co-evolutionarily respond.",

Despite the challenge of maintaining the product of X and E during the twentieth century, the U.S. did so. Several factors contributed to this capability, but as the twentieth century progressed the increasing population increased the number of minds that could be dedicated to increasing X and E.

Systems do not necessarily maximize energy gain, nor do they minimize energy loss, but instead systems maximize the useable power (energy divided by time) absorbed from the environment (Hall 2004) . This is similar to the argument expressed in the preceding sections, because X is a rate (energy per lifetime). Therefore, to say evolution acts to maximize X is to say selection acts to maximize power from the environment, consistent with Lotka's principle.

Bowles (2011) compared the energy efficiency of hunter gatherers to early farmers and found that the efficiency in terms of energy extracted per unit of labor was higher for huntergatherers than for farmers (see also Ponting 2007; Smil 2017) . This led Bowles to conclude that non-energetic factors explain the transition to agriculture. However, according to Lotka, natural selection favors maximum power (energy per unit time) rather than maximum efficiency (energy per unit input). Early farmers were able to extract more energy from the environment per unit time than hunter gatherers and this explains the success of the Neolithic revolution. That is, in a given year (time), a farming society could extract more energy than a hunter-gatherer society (Ponting 2007; Smil 2017 ) and could convert this energy to fitness. Thus, the transition to agriculture is consistent with the maximum power principle even while being inconsistent with explanations based on labor or energy efficiency.",

In other words, X max and X t substitute for K and N t in a standard discrete population growth model (as in Eqs. 3 and 4) . Fig. 3 Rate of change of K decreases as population size increases due to increasingly rapid technological innovation is determined by both by the energy available in the environment and the technology used to capture that energy. Therefore, X max can change via technological innovation. We propose that the change in X max is a linear function of population size; however, we also propose that X max is more likely to change as X t approaches X max .

Nonetheless, some of the critiques of the concept of socio-ecological collapse may be help clarify our argument. Tainter (2006) argued that the role of ecological change in socio-ecological collapse is historically unsupported. Instead, Tainter attributes the collapse of ancient societies principally to social failures. For example, Tainter ascribes the collapse of the Sumerian population around Ur in the late third millennia B.C.E. to poor irrigation practices combined with a failure of leadership to recognize the worsening agricultural situation. Thus, Tainter might disagree that population growth and environmental energy extraction were the primary causes of the collapse of Sumer. However, phrased in the context of carrying capacity evolution, Tainter is suggesting that the carrying capacity declined due to salinization of the soils, which was in turn a consequence of poor soil management. From our perspective, the decline in K was only possible, because K had been inflated by unsustainable irrigation practices. That is, societies use technology to increase X max (and thus K) and their populations grow accordingly. In some cases, societies might use this new technology to extract too many resources and the population might overshoot K with negative consequences; deforestation or prey extinction might be examples. In other cases, populations may not overshoot K, but K might decrease below the population size, because the system used to increase X was unsustainable (e.g., dryland agriculture in Sumer). In either case, the \"ecological\" in socio-ecological collapse is critical. We propose that human populations face two problems related to carrying capacity evolution. First, continued increases in K may become increasingly difficult due to thermodynamic constraints, eventually leading to a situation in which the human population exceeds carrying capacity and the population collapses. Second, increases in K may not be permanent and may depend on unsustainable extraction of energy and embodied energy from the environment. In this case, the population may not overshoot K but may nonetheless exceed K when K declines and experience collapse. Butzer (2012) proposes socio-ecological collapse begins with economic and fiscal decline over decadal to centennial timescales, coupled with and precipitating economic crises at decadal timescales. Butzer proposes that many of these economic and fiscal conditions are ecologic, for example, declining agricultural productivity and anthropogenic degradation, while others are socio-economic (economic depression; foreign attacks). However, from the perspective of the energetic version of AET described above, nearly all of the preconditions and triggers described by Butzer are energetic and ecologic. This is due to the thermodynamic linkage between economic activity and energy (Georgescu-Roegen 1975; Daly 1991) . That is, all economic activity implies the dissipation of energy so that when Butzer identifies \"economic depression\" as a trigger for socio-ecological collapse, this implies that human societies are no longer able to extract energy from the environment and convert that energy into economic activity as they had in the recent past. Similarly, when Butzer identifies \"foreign attacks\" as a stimulus for collapse, the energetic-AET model proposed here sees invasion and conflict as a mechanism for extracting increasing quantities of energy from the environment and thereby increasing K.",

The environmentalist's paradox is the observation that human wellbeing seems to be improving in the face of declining natural system wellbeing. Raudsepp-Hearne et al. (2010) both defined the environmentalist's paradox and evaluated four potential explanations for it. The four non-mutually exclusive potential explanations were that: (1) human well-being has been measured improperly; (2) human well-being is dependent only on food-related ecosystem services which have increased; (3) technology has decoupled human well-being from ecosystem services; and (4) time lags have insulated contemporary populations from future declines. While a complete critique of their analysis is beyond the scope of the present article, Raudsepp-Hearne et al. argued that human well-being has not been evaluated improperly but could not reject the other three hypotheses.",

Contra explanation (3), technology has not decoupled human dependence on ecosystem services, but shifted which ecosystem services we depend on and increased our dependence on them. Specifically, humans have used energy subsidies in the form of fossil fuels, renewables and nuclear energy to compensate for declines in energy flows from natural systems. For example, humans use energy in natural gas to reduce nitrogen for fertilizer production. Human wellbeing increases, because energy extraction has increased faster than population growth such that per capita primary energy consumption increased from 1336 kg of oil equivalent per person in 1971-1920 kg of oil equivalent per person in 2014. Consequently, human wellbeing has increased.",

Nonetheless, it is a consequence of the present hypothesis. To phrase the energetic AET hypothesis in the language of game theory, we hypothesize that the evolutionary stable strategy of human societies is maximized and increasing rates of energy extraction. Cases of sustainability in which societies fail to increase their energy extraction from the environment-as in some indigenous societies-are hence viewed as temporary, evolutionarily unstable strategies that will be outcompeted and replaced by more extractive strategies. This suggests a testable hypothesis: that societies with higher, less sustainable rates of energy extraction have outcompeted those with lower, more sustainable rates of energy extraction. Note that evolution in general, and cultural evolution specifically, is value-neutral (Sommers and Rosenberg 2003) , so while it may be troubling to view sustainable cultures as evolutionarily unstable, this does not falsify the hypothesis.",

However, the evolution of pathogen virulence is complex and depends on ecological and genetic factors in both the pathogen and the host and the history of interactions between the two (Knolle 1989; Antia et al. 1994; Levin 1996) . Furthermore, the germ theory of disease, vaccination, and the development of antibiotic represent techno-cultural changes in how many human societies responded to pathogens, and this change may be positively associated with population density and energy extraction from the environment. Thus, it may be interesting for future scholars to explore if pathogens act to limit population growth and energy extraction, or if technological innovation and population density have acted to remove the ability of pathogens to function as top-down population regulators.",

While such research is ongoing, less effort has focused on understanding why human societies are generally unsustainable in the first place. We propose that human societies are prone to unsustainability, because they have evolved to maximize their rate of energy extraction from the environment through a multi-level selective process acting on both genetic and cultural heritable variation. Specifically, genetic evolution at the individual level creates behavioral pre-adaptations (Van Vugt et al 2014) that works with cultural group selection to favor traits and technologies that increase energy extraction per unit time. This increased energy extraction is used to support increased population sizes and this increased population size further improves the ability of the group to innovate new means of energy extraction, leading to a positive feedback loop that is the ultimate cause of human unsustainability (recall Fig. 2 ).",
