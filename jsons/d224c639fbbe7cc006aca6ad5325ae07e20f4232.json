On 31 December, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On 9 January, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported a novel coronavirus as the causative agent of this outbreak. COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to have a wide spectrum of severity [1] . COVID-19 has become a public health emergency of relevant international concern, and it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March, 2020; by the end of that month, more than 750,000 cases and 36,500 deaths had been reported worldwide [2] .",

In line with SARS and MERS, SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe cases involves the host response as an important contributor to the disease process and tissue damage, mainly due to dysregulated and excessive innate immune responses. The primary immune response leads to viral clearance in most cases. However, for reasons that are still unclear, in a subgroup of patients, the secondary immune response may be exaggerated, leading to inflammatory-induced lung injury and complications including pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure, and potentially death [6] . This exaggerated response is considered a \"cytokine storm\" similar to that of secondary hemophagocytic histiocytosis, which leads to an hyperinflammation state, with unremitting fever, cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, and pulmonary involvement (including acute respiratory distress syndrome) in 50% of cases [7] . The cytokine profile associated with COVID-19 is characterized by elevated serum levels of multiple cytokines [3] , probably produced by highly inflammatory macrophages [8] . Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 surge during illness and decline upon recovery; overproduction of IL-6, IL-10, soluble IL-2 receptor, and TNF\u03b1 is inversely correlated with CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts, is associated with decreased IFN-\u03b3 expression in CD4+ cells, and correlates with the disease severity of COVID-19 [8, 9] . In severe cases, marked decreases in memory helper T cells and regulatory T cells have been observed [10] .",

Similarly to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [32] , immunosuppressed status (due to transplantation, chemotherapy, or other conditions requiring immunosuppressive treatment) has not been found to be a risk factor for an adverse outcome, such as death or admission to an intensive care unit, in patients with COVID-19 compared with the general population [33] . Data from a large European center for pediatric liver transplantation located in Lombardy demonstrated that for patients in the follow-up for cirrhosis, transplantation, autoimmune liver disease, or chemotherapy for hepatoblastoma, despite some testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, none developed clinical pulmonary disease [34] .",

An elevated Th17 response has also been observed in patients with MERS-CoV [38] and SARS-CoV [39] . In SARS-CoV-2, a Th17 response appears to contribute to the \"cytokine storm\", resulting in tissue damage and pulmonary edema. Extremely high numbers of CCR6\u00fe Th17 cells in the peripheral blood of a patient with severe COVID-19 support the role of the Th17 pathway in this disease [40] . Many psoriasis treatments inhibit the IL-17 pathway directly (IL-17A and IL-17R inhibitors) and indirectly (IL-23 inhibitors). Low levels of type I IFN seem to be common to COVID-19, SARS, and MERS, and may suppress Th1 and favor Th2 responses [41] , thus providing some rationale for the use of dupilumab, an IL-4/IL-13 inhibitor used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, to mitigate the \"cytokine storm\" seen in some patients with COVID-19.",

Baricitinib appears to be able to effectively inhibit AAK1 and GAK at the plasma concentration obtained with the submitted dosage for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (2-4 mg daily), as well as reducing IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 levels, which may be responsible for the more severe forms of interstitial pneumonia due to COVID-19 [42, 43] .
