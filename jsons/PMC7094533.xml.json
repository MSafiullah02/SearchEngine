The HPS contains a realistic airway and a lung model that undergoes gas exchange (ie, it removes oxygen and adds carbon dioxide to the system). The lung compliance and airway resistance also respond in a realistic manner to relevant challenges. In addition, the HPS produces an airflow pattern that is close to the in vivo human situation and has been applied in previous studies9\n10\n11\n12\n13 to simulate human respiration. In this study, we set the lung compliance and oxygen consumption of the HPS to 35 mL/cm H2O and 350 mL/min, respectively. This represented a patient with mild lung injury.14\n15 Tidal volume and respiratory rate were regulated so that a respiratory exchange ratio of 0.8 was maintained during the measurements. In this setting, the HPS breathed at a respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min with a tidal volume of 0.5 L. Oxygen flow was delivered to the HPS via the simple mask at 4 L/min initially, which was gradually increased to 6, 8, and 10 L/min during the study.",

Using laser smoke visualization methods, we have shown that exhaled air dispersed at maximal distances of 0.2, 0.22, 0.3, and 0.4 m (for contours of > 20%) lateral to the median sagittal line of the HPS when oxygen was delivered via a simple Hudson mask at increasing flows of 4, 6, 8, and 10 L/min respectively. Within these dispersal distances from the mask, the chance of exposure to the patient's exhaled air is significantly > 20%. The closer to the patient, the higher the chance of exposure to the patient's exhaled air. Thus, within dispersal distances of 0.16, 0.17, 0.25, and 0.35 m, there was at least a 60% chance of exposure to the exhaled air at oxygen flows of 4, 6, 8, and 10 L/min, respectively. Coughing increased the air dispersion distance from 0.17 m (without coughing in Fig 2, top right, B) to 0.2 m while the HPS was receiving 6 L/min of oxygen with at least a 60% chance of exposure within that distance. These findings have important clinical implications for the health-care workers who often manage patients with respiratory failure due to CAP of unknown etiology at a short distance. It is important to provide adequate respiratory protection for the health-care workers, in addition to applying standard, contact, and droplet precautions in order to prevent nosocomial infections.",

The inertia and weight of larger droplets in an air-droplet, two-phase flow would certainly cause them to have less horizontal dispersion than the continuous air carrier phase in which they traveled. However, the evaporation of water content in some droplets during oxygen therapy may produce droplet nuclei that are suspended in air, whereas the larger droplets will fall to the ground in a trajectory pathway. As the smoke particles in this study mark the continuous air phase, our data contours refer to exhaled air. Our results would represent the \u201cupper bound\u201d estimates for the dispersion of droplets that would be expected to follow a shorter trajectory than the air jet due to gravitational effects, but would not fully reflect the risk of droplet transmission.8 Second, the room airflow was switched off during the experiment in order to reveal the maximum distribution of exhaled air without interference by external factors. Further work is needed to assess the interaction between ward ventilation and the dispersion distances related to oxygen therapy. Last, we were unable to capture the maximum dispersion distance during coughing due to the limitation of the equipment used in this study. A higher speed camera with a wider laser beam will be required in future studies to detect the full range of dispersion distances during maneuvers such as coughing and sneezing.",

This represented cough efforts in a patient with mild lung injury.16 Although the video camera was not able to capture the maximum dispersion distance beyond 0.4 m for contours of > 20%, the leakage plume through the side vent of the simple mask was noted to stretch to distances of 0.4 and 0.2 m lateral to the median sagittal plane for contours of > 25% and > 60%, respectively.",
