As of April 8th, 2020, the epidemic had spread to more than 199 countries and more than one million individuals have contracted the virus worldwide with 81,478 reported deaths, including 82,048 confirmed cases in France and 10,869 deaths [2]. However, these numbers are probably underestimated as not all patients are tested, especially those who are asymptomatic, or with only mild symptoms and no associated comorbidities. The standard of reference for confirming COVID-19 relies on microbiological tests such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or sequencing [3]. However, these tests might not be available in an emergency setting and their results are not immediately available. Computed tomography (CT) can be used as an important complement to RT-PCR for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia in the current epidemic context [4], [5]. Indeed, when the viral load is insufficient, RT-PCR can be falsely negative while chest CT shows suggestive abnormalities [4], [5]. A large series based on 1014 patients reported a 97% sensitivity of chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19, while the mean time interval between initial negative and positive RT-PCR was approximately 5 days [5]. Thus, CT can play a pivotal role in the early detection and management of COVID-19 pneumonia [6], at least for patients who have been symptomatic for more than three days [4]. Indeed, 56% of patients imaged during the first 2 days following symptom onset may have normal CT findings [7].",

However, all studies indicate that the main CT feature of COVID-19 pneumonia is the presence of ground glass opacities (GGO), typically with a peripheral and subpleural distribution (Fig. 1\n). The involvement of multiple lobes, particularly the lower lobes is reported in the majority of patients with COVID-19 [10]. These areas of GGO may be admixed with areas of focal consolidation (Fig. 2\n) and or associated with superimposed intralobular reticulations, resulting in a crazy paving pattern (Fig. 3\n). Linear consolidations and other signs suggesting organizing pneumonia such as the reverse halo sign (i.e., areas of ground-glass surrounded by peripheral consolidation) are very frequently observed, mostly in patients several days after the onset of disease.",

Yuan et al. evaluated imaging findings associated with mortality and reported that the frequency of consolidations as well as the median CT score were both higher in the group of patients who died at the hospital, as compared to patients who could be discharged [11]. The CT score in this study was calculated as follows: CT attenuation was graded using a 3-point scale, with 1 for normal attenuation, 2 for ground glass and 3 for consolidation. Then the degree of lung involvement was evaluated for 6 lung regions: upper, middle and lower lung on each side and graded using a 5-point scale: 0 no involvement, 1 less than 25%, 2: 25\u201350%, 3: 50\u201375% and 4 > 75%. The maximal CT score was 72. Using a cut-off value of 24.5, the CT score predicted mortality with a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% [11]. Other predictive factors for mortality included older age and higher comorbidity rate [12]. In the series by Li et al., the incidence of consolidation, linear opacities and crazy-paving pattern in severe/critical patients was significantly higher than that observed in non-severe (e.g., ordinary) patients [13]. This series based on 83 patients also confirmed that severe/critical patients were older and with more co-morbidities [13].",

            "text": "COVID-19 pneumonia CT features change over time, with different presentations according to the phase and severity of lung infection. Pan et al. investigated lung changes by time in patients who recovered from COVID-19 [14]. They classified the evolution of lung abnormalities into four stages (early 0\u20134 days, progressive 5\u20138 days, peak 9\u201313 days, and absorption \u2265 14 days) according to time periods. They visually quantified the extent of CT abnormalities. Each of the 5 lung lobes was visually scored from 0 to 5 as follows: 0, no involvement; 1, < 5% involvement; 2, 25% involvement; 3, 26%\u201349% involvement; 4, 50%\u201375% involvement; and 5, > 75% involvement [14]. The total CT score ranged from 0 to a maximal value of 25. They found that the total CT score increased until about 10 days after symptom onset and then gradually decreased. Regarding the category of CT abnormalities, stage 2 was characterized by an increase of GGO extent, with a crazy-paving pattern more frequently observed [8]. On the opposite, in stage 3, consolidation was the main feature with a decreased GGO ratio. In a series of 919 patients, Salehi et al. confirmed this observation and reported that CT findings in the intermediate stage of the disease were characterized by an increase in the number and size of GGOs, a progressive transformation of GGO into multifocal consolidation, with septal thickening and development of a crazy-paving pattern [8]. The transformation of GGO into linear consolidation is typical for an evolution towards organizing pneumonia, which is a nearly universal response to lung injury whether it is focal or diffuse, due to infection, radiation therapy or following drug-induced pneumonitis (Fig. 6\n) [15]. Wang et al. also evaluated longitudinal changes and confirmed that pure ground glass was the most common observation after symptoms onset, whereas a mixed pattern combining ground glass with irregular linear opacity peaked on illness days 6-11 [10].",

It is associated with other suggestive signs such as septal lines, pleural effusion, large pulmonary veins and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. It has been reported that COVID-19 might be responsible for acute myocarditis [20]. This diagnosis should be suspected if there are signs of interstitial pulmonary edema such as septal lines in younger patients (Fig. 11\n). Intra alveolar hemorrhage due to small vessel vasculitis is also characterized by diffuse GGO, but patients usually present with mild hemoptysis and acute renal failure is associated especially in Goodpasture syndrome. There is no subpleural predominance contrary to that seen in COVID-19 (Fig. 12\n) [21]. Drug-induced pneumonitis manifesting as nonspecific interstitial pneumonia is another cause of ground glass. Subpleural sparing, history of drug exposure help diagnosis. Those manifesting as organized pneumonia have similarities to COVID-19, but are associated with GGO and occur in a very different context [22].",
