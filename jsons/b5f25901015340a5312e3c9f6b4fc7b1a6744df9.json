Although some of these candidates can induce high levels of nAbs in vaccinated animals and have entered phase 1 clinical trials [15] [16] [17] , most of these candidates are associated with low immunogenicity requiring multiple doses [18] . Importantly, vaccine research on other members of the coronaviruses including SARS-CoV [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] revealed several safety concerns associated with the use of S-based vaccines, including inflammatory and immunopathological effects such as pulmonary eosinophilic infiltration and antibody (Ab)-mediated disease enhancement following subsequent viral challenge of vaccinated animals. Recently, we also showed that whole inactivated MERS-CoV vaccine (WIV) is associated with significantly increased pulmonary eosinophilic infiltration accompanied by elevated levels of Th2 cytokines in vaccinated human DPP4 transgenic (hDPP4 Tg + ) mice in response to virus challenge [28] . Given these previous observations, a MERS-CoV vaccine based on the full-length S protein could pose potential safety concerns similar to those associated with SARS-CoV vaccines. While the neutralizing epitope-rich S1 region could be considered as an alternative target for an effective and safe MERS vaccine, S1-based protection could clearly be enhanced through appropriate immunological modulation.",

It is expressed transiently on activated CD4 + T cells mainly [29, 30] . CD40L and its receptor CD40, which is constitutively expressed on all antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [29] [30] [31] , represent a crucial link between innate and adaptive immunity [31, 32] . The potential of CD40L as a molecular adjuvant has been investigated by several groups using multiple strategies [33] [34] [35] [36] . We have previously developed a nonreplicating recombinant adenovirus 5 (rAd5) vectored prototype vaccine in which secreted viral proteins are targeted to CD40-expressing APCs using CD40L [37, 38] . Such studies provided a proof of concept for a vaccine platform characterized by enhanced durability, breadth, potency, and universal protection against influenza viruses in different mouse models. Here, we further extended and optimized our previous platform using rAd5 expressing a secreted and CD40-targeted fusion protein comprised of head globular ectodomains of both MERS-CoV S1 protein and murine CD40L (rAd5-S1/F/CD40L) using a trimerization motif to express the fusion protein as a trimer and a nonpolar linker to provide flexibility. The vaccine was then subjected to systematic analyses of protection and safety in the highly MERS-CoV permissive hDPP4 Tg + mouse model.",

In brief, all available MERS-CoV S sequences were downloaded from the GenBank database, and the dataset was filtered by removing sequences containing ambiguous amino acid codes (BJOUXZ). The final dataset was multiply aligned using CLUSTALW, the Shannon entropy for each position was determined, and the consensus S1 subunit sequence was obtained. The signal peptide from the MERS-CoV S protein was maintained at the N-terminus to secrete the fusion protein from rAd5-infected cells. The synthetic fusion gene was synthesized by linking the coding region of MERS-CoV S1 to a histidine tag coding sequence, followed by coding region for the fibritin trimerization motif [37] connected via a nonpolar amino acid linker to the ectodomain of CD40L (amino acids 117-260) coding region to express the fusion protein S1/F/CD40L. The fusion gene was then used to generate the proposed rAd5 construct (rAd5-S1/F/CD40L) in addition to rAd5 vaccines expressing secreted and consensus S1 protein alone (rAd5-S1) and a vector control expressing Green Fluorescent Protein (rAd5-GFP) as shown in Figure 1 .",

Here, we observed that both rAd5-S1/F/CD40L and rAd5-S1 induced S1-specific Abs from all isotypes in hDPP4 Tg + mice after primary or secondary immunization ( Figure 3 ). As expected, control vector (rAd5-GFP) failed to elicit any S1-specific Ab response. Notably, a single dose or 2 doses of rAd5-S1/F/CD40L consistently elicited significantly higher levels of total IgG as well as IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b isotypes compared with the control group immunized with rAd5-GFP (Figure 3 ), whereas immunization with a single dose of rAd5-S1 induced significant titers of total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a but not IgG2b compared to the control group, with a second dose of rAd5-S1 eventually inducing significantly higher levels of IgG2b compared to the control group. Interestingly, immunizing mice with a second dose of rAd5-S1/F/CD40L enhanced the levels of circulatory IgG and all tested isotypes compared with the rAd5-S1-vaccinated group. Furthermore, 2 doses of rAd5-S1 only enhanced IgG2b significantly compared to 1 dose, with mean IgG1:IgG2a ratios being 3.8 (SD, 3.2) and 3.9 (SD, 3.2) after priming and boosting, respectively. In contrast, boosting with a second dose of rAd5-S1/F/CD40L resulted in a significant increase in total IgG, particularly in IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes but not IgG1, compared with a single dose of rAd5-S1/F/CD40L, suggesting a bias toward Th1 response as demonstrated by mean IgG1:IgG2a ratios of 3.4 (SD, 2.4) and 1.8 (SD, 1.4) after priming and boosting, respectively. Together, these data showed that targeting the secreted S1 to CD40-expressing APCs via CD40L (rAd5-S1/F/ CD40L) not only enhanced S1-specific IgG Abs levels but also boosted Th1 responses, as demonstrated by markedly elevated titers of S1-specific IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies, especially after boosting.",

As shown in Figure 4 , a single dose of either rAd5-S1/F/CD40L or rAd5-S1 elicited high levels of nAbs compared to the control group (rAd5-GFP), with rAd5-S1/F/CD40L, but not rAd5-S1, being consistently capable of inducing significantly higher levels of nAbs against both live and pseudotyped MERS-CoV virus, suggesting that rAd5-S1/F/CD40L is better than rAd-S1 vaccine in promoting strong humoral response and neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV. However, after boosting once, all rAd5-S1/F/ CD40L-and rAd5-S1-immunized animals elicited robust and significant levels of nAbs, indicating that at least 2 doses of rAd-S1 are required to induce nAb levels similar to those obtained by a single dose of rAd5-S1/F/CD40L. These findings clearly confirm that incorporation of CD40L as molecular adjuvant could effectively enhance the immunogenicity of S1-based vaccines and may represent a very promising vaccine platform to induce protective immunity with a single dose.",

It was clear that mice immunized twice with either rAd5-S1 or rAd5-S1/F/CD40L were completely protected based on clinical signs of disease (weight loss) and mortality ( Figure 5 ), whereas rAd5-GFP-immunized animals expectedly succumbed to lethal infection within days, likely due to encephalitis [28, 40] .

These results were further confirmed by an average of 3-to 4-log reduction in pulmonary viral RNA, compared to that of the rAd5-GFP-immunized group ( Figure 6 ). It should be mentioned that, albeit not statistically significant, rAd5-S1/F/CD40L-immunized animals had a viral RNA load lower by 1 log compared with the rAd5-S1 group, consistent with the overall stronger immune response we observed in this group.",

Surprisingly, although rAd5-S1 immunization protected animals from death and weight loss and prevented the lung infiltration similar to rAd5-S1/F/CD40L, we observed perivascular hemorrhage in the whole lung of all examined mice immunized with rAd5-S1 but not those vaccinated with rAd5-S1/F/CD40L (Figure 7) .

This threat is further complicated by the absence of prophylactic or therapeutic measures. Therefore, development of an effective and safe vaccine is urgently needed to prevent or contain MERS-CoV. Several groups have investigated various MERS-CoV vaccine platforms in several animal models [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] 28] . However, serious safety concerns are associated with vaccines for several coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and need to be elucidated and better understood [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . We showed in this study that although rAd5 expressing S1 or CD40-targeted S1 were both capable of inducing significant levels of IgG and nAbs specific to MERS-CoV in immunized mice, incorporation of CD40L substantially enhances the immunogenicity of S1, as demonstrated by the effectiveness of a single immunization dose, which was sufficient to elicit stronger and robust immune responses compared to control groups, consistent with our previous reports [37, 38] . Importantly, both S1 and CD40-targeted S1 vaccines provided complete protection, prevented virus replication significantly, and prevented monocytic and lymphocytic lung infiltration as compared to control group. However, the non-CD40-targeted vaccine (rAd5-S1) uniformly induced varying degrees of severe perivascular hemorrhage within the lungs of all examined mice following viral challenge, regardless of the exhibited full protection against lethal MERS-CoV challenge. While these data suggest that there might be yet to be explained lung pathology associated with rAd5 vector-and/or MERS-CoV S1-based vaccines, our results clearly show that including CD40L as a fusion protein of S1-based MERS-CoV vaccine could prevent or at least mitigate the safety concern of undesirable immunopathology while affording complete protection in hDPP4 Tg + mice.",

However, these studies have mainly focused on the immunogenicity and/or the protective efficacy, and may have overlooked any possible vaccine-associated pathology, especially after viral challenge. Our finding that rAd5-S1 immunized animals were completely protected despite the observed pathology is reminiscent of the immunopathology documented using WIV for MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and respiratory syncytial virus after viral challenge [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [43] [44] [45] . It is of note that lung pathology was also observed in some previous studies involving rhesus macaques immunized with high doses of DNA vaccines expressing MERS-CoV S protein [16] , as well as in mouse models vaccinated with RBD or vectored vaccines encoding S protein [46] [47] [48] . Nevertheless, this is the first report of vaccine-associated severe pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage after viral challenge. Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying such vaccine-induced pulmonary injury associated with rAd5-S1 vaccination remain to be determined, several factors could have been involved. Specifically, the likely higher levels of residual infectious viruses in rAd5-S1-immunized mice as detected by RT-qPCR, and the quantitative and perhaps qualitative difference of specific antibody and T-cell responses, as evidenced by the lower levels of Ig2a and IgG2b found in this group, could have played a role. . Pulmonary viral load. Viral load was determined in the lungs of immunized and challenged mice with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Viral load was determined as Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose per gram (TCID 50 /g) and TCID 50 equivalent per gram (TCID 50 eq/g) by TCID 50 and reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays, respectively. Limit of detection in the TCID 50 assay was 2.5 log 10 (dashed line) . TCID 50 eq/g was determined using a standard curve generated from dilutions of RNA from a MERS-CoV with known virus titer. Titers are shown as mean with standard deviation from 4 mice per group from 1 experiment. ***P < .0002 (1-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni posttest); ns, not significant.

Moreover, there is a huge gap in our understanding of the correlates of protection in camels, and the waning nature of nAbs in these animals [49, 50] might hinder the \"One Health\" approach in tackling the MERS epidemic. Therefore, it is critical to better understand and elucidate any safety concerns that might be associated with MERS-CoV vaccine to develop a safe and effective human vaccine. Our previous studies have mainly focused on the development of candidate universal influenza vaccines using vectored vaccines by targeting antigens to CD40-expressing cells via CD40L. This platform was modified, optimized, and utilized to generate an immunogenic, protective, and safe MERS-CoV vaccine based on the S1 subunit of the MERS-CoV S protein, thus representing a promising platform for vaccine development against a broad range of pathogens.
