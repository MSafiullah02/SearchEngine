Much of the work in this field has been conducted in inbred mouse strains by gen-specific insertion of selection markers by conventional homologous recombination (HR) in embryonic stem cells. Although widely appreciated the methodology can be labor intensive with modest efficiency and heritability. Furthermore, the retention of an exogenous selection marker and the genetic homogeneity of inbred strains may produce confounding effects. Thus, working with models of human conditions reproducible and significant findings in an outbred strain can be preferable as these are more likely to mimic human biology.",

            "text": "In recent years, several novel genome-editing technologies have emerged from which the four most studied methods count zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) (Kim et al. 1996), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) (Sun and Zhao 2013), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) (Wang et al. 2014) and engineered meganucleases (Epinat et al. 2003). Each technique has demonstrated highly efficient and locus-specific genome editing in numerous species. As to TALENs, their binding site is determined by a central domain composed of tandem 33\u201335 amino acid (aa) long repeats. In each repeat, the residues at positions 12 and 13, being the \u2018repeat-viable di-residues\u2019 (RVD), cipher the binding target (Cermak et al. 2011). Structurally, the catalytic domain of the FokI nuclease has been fused to the TALE protein at the C-terminal providing DNA double-strand breaking capabilities (Miller et al. 2011). Importantly, efficient TALEN-mediated gene targeting has been demonstrated across different animal orders such as in zebrafish (Bedell et al. 2012), mouse (Sung et al. 2013; Qiu et al. 2013), and human cells (Ding et al. 2013; Hockemeyer et al. 2011).",

ANGII is the primary effector hormone and catalyzed by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in lung capillaries and, conversely, inactivated by ACE2. The latter produces a C-terminal trimmed cleavage product of ANGII (ANG1-7) possessing inverse biological functions to ANGII. The balance of the two enzyme homologues controls the concentration of ANGII, and consequently regulates the RAS cascade (Guyton 1992).",

A RAS-pathway unrelated role in intestinal homeostasis has been suggested in which the uptake of the essential amino acid tryptophan through the luminal surface of the colon is dependent on ACE2. Tryptophan is required for the production of vitamin B3, which on the other hand regulates the expression of antimicrobial peptides through the mTOR pathway. As a consequence can ACE2 deficient mice not cope with the altered intestinal microbiome succeeding and insult and develop colitis. Thus, ACE2 appears to link amino acid malnutrition to intestinal microbial ecology and inflammation (Hashimoto et al. 2012; Izcue and Powrie 2012). Conflicting data, however, exists showing anti-inflammation effects of an ACE2 inhibitor (Byrnes et al. 2009).",

Construction of a TALEN pair targeting exon 2 of the Ace2 locus (recognition sequence in bold) and encompassing a 16 bp spacer region containing a DraI restriction site (underlined) was pursued (5\u2032-TCACCGAGGAAAATGCCAAGACATTTTTAAACAACTTTAATCAGGAAGCTGA-3\u2032) (Fig. 1a). A spacer region shorter than 20 bp has previously been shown to be preferable to longer spacer regions in mouse ES cells (Qiu et al. 2013). RVD modules were assembled into the pTAL3 vector using the Golden Gate method (Cermak et al. 2011), and subsequently cloned into the modified backbone-vector pTAL-3.1, in which a cassette encoding a 152 aa TALE N-terminal and a 63 aa C-terminal segment fused to an enhanced FokI nuclease flank either side of the insert (Miller et al. 2011). The FokI nuclease sequences were slightly dissimilar each contained three aa substitutions, being Q486E, I499L and N496D in one and E490 K, I538 K and H537R in the other FokI nuclease domain, known to enhance specificity and thus reducing off-target effects (Doyon et al. 2011). For in vitro transcription, a T3 promoter was inserted upstream of the TALEN cassette producing the final construct denoted pTAL-3.1 (Fig. 1b).\n",

All listed male mice are Ace2\n\u2212/y whereas all female mice are mono-allelic knockouts, Ace2\n\u2212/+. To assess if the introduced frameshift mutations in F1 Ace2\u2212/y mice disrupted gene-expression already at the level of mRNA, potentially due to non-sense mediated decay, and to clarify if it affected transcription of shorter isoform, we performed reverse transcription semi-quantitative PCR on total RNA extracted from three Ace2\n\u2212/y mice (#5*, #11* and #36*) and three male wt controls (#12, #31, #38). The two longer Ace2 transcripts where identifying with exon 7\u20139 spanning primers, whereas for the short putative isoform exon 1 and 3 spanning primers (corresponding to exon 7 and 9 in the longer isoforms) were used (Fig. 4a\u2013c). The longer isoforms are present in all analyzed animals although the band-intensity is weaker in the KO animals hinting at a lower mRNA level plausible due to non-sense mediated decay of the out of frame transcript. Importantly, no short Ace2 mRNA was present in any of the investigated animals suggesting that this particular isoform is not expressed in the colon, which could otherwise be a source of confounding effects. On the other hand, even though immunodetection of the shorter ACE2 variant has been reported in renal cortex, the overall activity of ACE2 was below 8 % (Wysocki et al. 2006).\n\n",

The colitis responses have been reported to be dependent on DSS concentration, molecular weight, duration of the exposure, and also genetic background (Perse and Cerar 2012). In this study, clinical problems were eventually observed in all mice challenged with DSS, including body weight loss (Fig. 5a) and severe diarrhea (data not shown). More importantly, challenged ACE2-deficient mice suffered from more severe diarrhea and lost much more body weight compared to age- and gender-matched wild-type littermates that were equally exposed to the drug. After 7 days DSS feeding, the colon length of mice from the challenged groups was shorter compared to the control groups (wt, DSS vs. wt control and Ace2-KO, DSS vs. Ace2-KO, control; Fig. 5b). Moreover, we detected significant shortening of the colon in DSS treated Ace2-KO mice compared to the wt counterparts, a phenotypic trait characteristic for severe colitis.\n",

            "text": "As intestinal injury causes a gut epithelium elicited inflammatory response (Karhausen et al. 2013), we carried out haematoxylin and eosin staining to assess the histopathologic alterations in the colon. Infiltration of inflammatory cells was observed in two groups of mice treated with DSS (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Figure S3). In contrast to treated wild-type mice, colons of treated Ace2\n\u2212/y mice showed a higher degree of leukocyte infiltration. Overt damage to the intestinal mucosae could be observed, including shedding of epithelium and the breakdown of the lamina propria. Furthermore, a large number of leukocytes entered into the lamina propria. However, severe histologic changes could be observed in one of the three DSS treated control mice. In patients with lymphoplasmacytic colitis, inflammation of the lamina propria is interspersed between regions of normal mucosa making it conceivable that a patchy lymphoplasmacytic inflammation is present in all DSS treated mice but with a higher occurrence in Ace2\n\u2212/y mice. In previous studies, the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and macrophages at the site of inflammation has been recognized as key steps in the intestinal immune response (Knutson et al. 2013; Mangerich et al. 2012). Furthermore, evidence suggests a causal link between infiltration of leukocytes and colitis severity (McBee et al. 2010). Together, this suggests that the inactivation of Ace2 potentially leads to a more severe form of DSS induced colitis in the herein described mice through lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and mucosal barrier damage.\n",

            "text": "Inappropriate activation of the mucosal immune system can trigger the onset of colitis. Numerous studies have shown that the expression and secretion of various cytokines is altered in inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (Nanau and Neuman 2012; Wittkopf et al. 2014; Simoes e Silva et al. 2013). The elevated expression of cytokines belonging to the IL-17 and IL-22 pathways such as IL1-\u03b2 (interleukin 1 beta), IL6 (interleukin 6), IL10 (interleukin 10), IFN-\u03b3 (interferon gamma) and TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor alpha) point to the recruitment of neutrophils and possibly also natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages at the site of inflammation (Knutson et al. 2013). We therefore evaluated the transcription profile of several inflammatory cytokines presumably changed in mice with DSS-induced colitis. By use of reverse transcription quantitative (RT-qPCR) we quantified the expression level of IL1-\u03b2, IL6, IFN-\u03b3, Il10 and TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 7a\u2013e). A detectable increase in mRNA expression of IL1-\u03b2, IL6 and TNF-\u03b1 was exhibited in DSS-fed wild-type mice in contrast to controls, implying a modest inflammation. Notably, Ace2\n\u2212/y mice consistently displayed a robust up-regulated expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1-\u03b2, IL6, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1) by 20-fold to 270-fold compared to their genetic counterparts. In contrast, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 was only modestly up-regulated in treated Ace2\n\u2212/y mice and not in treated wt mice. A plausible explanation for this observation is the IL10 secretion stimuli of IL6 and the presence of NK cells, which activity is known to be inhibited by IL10 (Conti et al. 2003; Mauer et al. 2014). More importantly, this dramatic increase in cytokine transcription was also evident when compared to DSS-fed wild-type mice and thus in line with the more severe pathological alterations identified in the knockout mice. Taken together, these molecular clues suggested that Ace2 gene disruption conceivably is the driver of the colitis progression in the herein studied mice.\n",

Repair of TALEN-induced DNA breaks in the Ace2 gene resulted in 19 alleles featuring small deletions (<20 bp) and only one allele containing an insertion in all the 21 modified alleles investigated. This finding is in coherence with previous findings in which murine cells were microinjected with TALEN mRNA or even whole-genome sequencing of human cells following CRISPR/Cas9-induced repair (Wang et al. 2014; Qiu et al. 2013; Li et al. 2014).

As an alternative approach, we delivered in vitro transcribed TALEN mRNA into the cytoplasm, generating the 28 genetically modified founder mice. The significant improvement of efficiency is likely due to the fact that cytoplasmic injection of abundant mRNA will result in more robust transcription than nucleic injection of DNA cassettes (Farrow et al. 2006). The rapid onset of transcription furthermore increases the likelihood of manipulating totipotent cells and thus what are to become primordial germ cells, enhancing transmission efficiency.

All Ace2\n\u2212/y mice exhibited a higher loss of body weight compared to matched wild-type animals after the challenge, which is likely due to severe diarrhea. Plausible this can be ascribed to the excessive inflammatory response and colon injury observed in the knockouts. Elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines fitting a neutrophil profile such as TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 were present in an exceedingly high level in the DSS challenged Ace2\n\u2212/y mice compared to the wt counterparts, pointing to an immense acute phase inflammation in the knockouts. Furthermore, an IL10 mediated anti-inflammatory response appeared to be activated in the induced Ace2\n\u2212/y mice. Notably, IL10 deficient mice develop spontaneous colitis (Sellon et al. 1998). Colon histopathology and the examination of anatomy substantiated these findings by showing damage to the mucosae layer of the intestine, infiltration of leukocytes in the epithelium and a shortening of length.",

It circumvents the challenge of low transgenerational transmission otherwise seen in blastocysts injected with manipulated ES cells. More so, this can be achieved in genetically heterozygous animals. The inhere described result made in the Ace2\n\u2212/y mice are consistent with findings in a similar mouse model produced by the conventional HR-based approach (Hashimoto et al. 2012), thereby underpinning the usability of TALENs as an alternative to ES cell-based gene targeting.",
