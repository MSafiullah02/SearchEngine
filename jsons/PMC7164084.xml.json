            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) (EC 3.4.11.2; CD13), also known as CD13, is a type 2 transmembrane zinc\u2010dependent metallopeptidase of the superfamily of gluzincins with a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa [1, 2], which forms a noncovalently bound homodimer on the cellular membrane. It has a conserved pentapeptide consensus sequence HEXXH representing a zinc\u2010binding motif in its extracellular metalloprotease domain and therefore belongs to the M1 family of aminopeptidase. The enzyme hydrolyzes oligopeptides and preferentially releases neutral amino acids from the N\u2010terminal end of small peptides [3, 4]. APN/CD13 was first described as a marker for hematopoietic cells in myeloid origin, and it expresses in many cells and tissues, including myeloids, fibroblasts, brain cells, hepatocytes, osteoclasts, endometrial cells, epithelial cells of the liver, kidney, intestine, and in synaptic membranes of central nervous system [5, 6]. Because of its broad expression, the function of APN strongly depends on its location. In the intestinal brush border, APN is involved in the terminal degradation of small peptides and amino\u2010acid scavenging. In synaptic membranes, APN inactivates endorphins and enkephalins. In addition, APN participates in the inflammatory reaction and the processing of peptides, and APN could also act as the receptor for the transmissible gastroenteritis virus and the human coronavirus.",

And bestatin is also a potent competitive inhibitor (K\ni = 1.4\u20134.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 M) of APN with antitumor activities and immunomodulating activities. APN inhibitor includes natural inhibitors, such as bestatin, lapstatin, phebestin, curcumin, pasmmaplin A, and betulinic acid (Figure S1) [8, 9, 10], and synthetic small molecule inhibitors such as peptidomimetics and nonpeptides. Generally speaking, because of low bioavailability, rapid elimination, proteolytic lability, and short duration of action etc, the application of peptides in clinic is limited. Therefore, peptidomimetics or peptide mimics are becoming more and more popular to researchers.",

In non\u2010small cell lung cancer, human pancreatic carcinoma and prostate cancer, the expression of APN/CD13 for patients is associated with a poor prognosis, and APN expression is supposed to be involved in the cancer invasion and metastasis [12, 13, 14, 15]. Therefore, some researchers proposed that APN may be a new prognostic marker for cancer. In the progress of solid tumor, the formation of new blood vessels is of more importance. The new vasculature supplies nutrients and oxygen for tumors [16]. APN also participates in tumor angiogenesis through regulating filopodia formation and endothelial invasion [17]. Meanwhile, APN is present on tumor endothelial cells, but not on existing blood vessels in normal tissues [18]. Through proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix, APN and other proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases contribute to the growth and metastasis of tumors.",

Furthermore, the cyclic\u2010imide peptidomimetics shared same common feather pharmacophore with bestatin (Figure S2). APN is also closely related to the angiogenesis and the invasion of tumor cells.

The Lineweaver\u2013Burk plots were constructed to determine the K\nm as shown in \nFigure 3a\n, which was 0.286 mm. To determine the K\ni values for APN inhibitors, Dixon method was employed (\nFigure 3b\n). The K\ni value for bestatin was 1.56 \u03bcm. This data correlated with the APN enzyme activity assay (\nFigure 2a\n), which showed that bestatin was the most potent inhibitor for APN. 13d showed the lowest affinity for the aminopeptidase, with a K\ni value of 74.87 \u03bcm, which also correlated with the APN enzyme activity assay. However, 13d was the most active compound to inhibit the viability of HL\u201060 cells. We proposed that 13d also targets to other protein and has some cytotoxicity activity. The K\ni value for 13f and 22f was 6.26 and 7.46 \u03bcm.",
