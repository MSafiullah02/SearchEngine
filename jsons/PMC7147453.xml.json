Similar reports are available from analysis of Nellore cattle uterine metagenome (Laguardia-Nascimento et al. 2015). Antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs) and bacteriocins which act via membrane active mechanisms are widely used in food industries, feed industry and also be used in personal care products, surmounting the pathogens (Ong et al. 2014; Juturu and Wu 2018). As genitourinary tract microbiota is least explored, it is important to study the reproductive ecosystem of livestock species to understand microbial causes and cure of infertility. The bioengineered probiotics producing high titers of AMPs could enhance benefits of probiotics as well as antimicrobial peptides vis-a-vis their role in reviving reproductive health of animals.",
