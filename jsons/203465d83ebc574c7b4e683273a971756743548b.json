Among these structural proteins, the S protein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzymes 2 (ACE2) present on the surface of human cells, especially the alveolar type II cells that highly express this receptor, and then the virus enters the host lung cells [5, 6] . Effective immune responses against viral infections depend on IFN-I production from innate immune cells and subsequently cell mediated immunity through T helper 1 and cytotoxic T cells [5] . So, as the virus enters the cell, its genome is recognized by various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3), TLR7-9, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), Melanomadifferentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), then signaling pathways are initiated. Following these incidences, large amounts of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines are secreted [7] [8] [9] [10] . Following these inflammatory conditions in the lungs, which also increase with the proliferation of the virus, a sharp increase in inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and",

Pathogenic T cells produce inflammatory cytokines after activation and subsequently inflammatory monocytes and other leukocytes migrate to the lung [15] . Increased neutrophil counts have been reported as a symptom in a number of patients [2] . These activated immune cells may cause pulmonary damage induced by inflammation resulting in complications such as pneumonia, loss of lung function, ARDS, and even death (Fig. 1A ) [5, [12] [13] [14] . Since ARDS is recognized as one of the leading causes of mortality in patients and appears to be caused by cytokine storm, so, suppression of this inflammation may cause decrease inflammatory cytokine production and consequently reduce inflammation and lung injury. As has been shown, the use of Anti-IL6 in patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia can be useful and has been approved in China [16] . Currently, there is no approved treatment for SARS-CoV-2, and usually supportive treatments such as the use of ventilators and muscle relaxants were used for these patients [6, 16, 17] . Numerous therapeutic interventions have been performed to treat ARDS, but since the mechanisms of damage in ARDS are complex and diverse, it seems that therapeutic strategies that target a single pathway or mediator cannot be useful in achieving therapeutic outcome [17] . Therefore, interventions that target several aspects of immunopathogenesis and associated injuries, can be helpful to find the appropriate treatment strategy. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . MSCs are the multipotent cells that can be obtained from different tissues such as, adipose tissue and bone marrow. These cells have the self-renewing capacity and can be differentiated into chondrogenic, osteogenic and adipogenic lineages [25] . Several features of these cells have made them an appealing candidate for the treatment of many diseases, including ARDS. \uf0b7 Immunomodulatory properties: MSCs able to alter the function of the immune cells and modulate the immune response [17] . For example, In LPS-induced ARDS animal models, it has been shown that, MSCs suppress inflammation and reduce inflammationinduced lung injury through their immunomodulatory properties. These cells affect the macrophages by releasing prostaglandin E2 (PG-E2), and reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines and increase IL-10 production. IL-10 reduced neutrophils recruitment to the lungs and attenuated inflammatory cytokine production [20, 22, 24] .",

Intravenous or intratracheal injection can be performed. It is suggested to use both of these routes and compare them with each other. Injection program can be designed like this: PBS, exosomes derived from other sources such as fibroblasts, MSCexosomes (dose 1), MSC-exosomes (dose 2), and other doses.",

Lung function assessment can be investigated through arterial oxygenation and static lung compliance evaluation [22] . In addition to these, histological examination or micro-CT can be done for assessment of the lung injury. BALL is an important sample for evaluating the effects of MSC-exorcisms' on lung inflammation. After collection of the BALL sample, differential leukocyte count can be done. For the monitoring of the viral load, real time PCR is a beneficial technique. Evaluating the cytokine profile using ELISA can be useful. Another sample is blood, that differential leukocyte count, inflammatory cytokines and CRP level are the important data for evaluating MSC-exosomes effects on ARDS and cytokine storm. All of these procedure can be performed in clinical trials studies after confirmation in animal models ( Fig. 2 ).",

            "text": "Since COVID-19 treatment is currently focused on supportive therapies and no vaccine has not been developed for it [6] , so, numerous research studies are needed to find potential therapies to control the virus as soon as possible. Because SARS-CoV-2 has high transmission potential and spreads rapidly throughout the world and causes many deaths. Since the pathogenesis of this disease was identified partially in previous studies and there are similarities between its pathogenesis with that of other viruses in this family and some bacterial infections and can cause lung injury with ARDS [1, 5, 14] , so, investigation of the therapeutic approaches that can suppress inflammation, cytokine storm and ARDS can be helpful in finding a novel therapeutic approach for this disease. Therefore, the use of MSCs as one of the immunomodulating and tissue regenerating cells that have previously shown satisfactory effects on ARDS and cytokine storms [19, [21] [22] [23] [24] 39] could be considered. Since these cells exert their effects in a variety of ways, such as exosomes secretion, the use of their exosomes can be considered as a cell-free therapy [31] . Because these exosomes can have antiinflammatory effects on lung tissue by transferring mRNAs, miRNAs, and various proteins from its secretory cell to the target cell [40] . As previously shown, these exosomes can reduce inflammatory cytokines, increase regulatory cytokines and suppress inflammation [34] .",

Accumulation of the inflammatory cells resulted in production of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, that knowns as cytokine storm. Cytokine storm is the main cause of ARDS in COVID-19. These inflammatory response may cause apoptosis of the alveolar cells, lung fibrosis, edema, and organ failure. (B) MSCs and their exosomes suppress inflammation and reduce inflammation-induced lung injury through their immunomodulatory properties. These cells affect the macrophages and alter the phenotype of macrophages to M2 macrophages by releasing PG-E2. MSCs also reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines and increase IL-10 production. IL-10 reduced neutrophils recruitment to the lungs.
