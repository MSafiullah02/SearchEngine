            "text": "Astroviruses (from the Greek, astron meaning star) were discovered in 1975, in association with an outbreak of diarrhea in humans. Since that time they have been isolated from many other mammals including pigs, cats, minks, dogs, rats, bats, calves, sheep, and deer as well as from marine mammals such as sea lions and dolphins. Astroviruses have also been isolated from birds; they can cause significant disease in turkeys, ducks, and chickens. Astroviruses are unsegmented, positive-sense RNA viruses with B7\u00c09 kb genomes. These small, unenveloped viruses have spikes that project about 41 nm from the surface of the capsid, giving them a star-like appearance ( Fig. 14.1 and Box 14.1). HAstVs cause gastroenteritis in children and adults. Symptoms last 3\u00c04 days and include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, malaise, and abdominal pain. For the most part, disease is self-limiting.",

Genomes have three long overlapping reading frames (ORFs) that encode polyproteins ( Fig. 14. 2). There are short untranslated regions at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of the genome. Similar to other positivestrand RNA viruses (for example togaviruses and coronaviruses), two ORFs covering the 5 0 half of the genome encode nonstructural proteins (NSPs) that include proteases, membrane-associated proteins, an NTP-binding protein, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). ORFs for NSPs are overlapping and synthesis of the longer polyprotein product likely requires a ribosomal frame-shift between ORF1a and ORF1b ( Fig. 14. 2). Astrovirus RNA is not capped, and based on the presence of a protein sequence similar to calicivirus VPg (in ORF1b), it is postulated that RNA synthesis is initiated using a protein primer. Astrovirus replication is cytoplasmic.",

Astrovirus infection does not notably alter intestinal architecture and does not induce inflammation. It has been proposed that pathogenesis may be caused by apoptotic death of infected epithelial cells. Symptomatic infections are most common in children younger than 2 years of age, and it is estimated that 5%\u00c09% of cases of viral diarrhea in young children are caused by astroviruses. In the US population the presence of antiastrovirus antibodies is very high, indicating that most infections are asymptomatic or very mild. Outbreaks of astrovirusassociated diarrhea have been reported among elderly patients and military recruits. Food-borne outbreaks, affecting thousands of individuals, have occurred in Japan. In temperate climates astrovirus infection is highest during winter months while in tropical regions prevalence is highest during the rainy season (Box 14.2) .",

(Stenglein et al., 2012 However, there is a good example of CNS-associated astrovirus infection in an animal model. Shaking mink syndrome is a neurologic disorder of farmed minks. Outbreaks have occurred in Denmark, Sweden, and Finland. Examination of diseased mink revealed brain lesions (nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis) and experimental infection of brain homogenates into healthy mink recapitulated the disease, a result highly suggestive of an infectious agent. Attempts to culture an infectious agent were unsuccessful but the agent was finally identified using metagenomics. Nucleic acids sequences were obtained from brain material of diseased and healthy mink. Comparisons revealed an astrovirus genome associated only with diseased mink. The CNS-associated astrovirus shares about 80% nucleotide identity with an enteric mink astrovirus.",
