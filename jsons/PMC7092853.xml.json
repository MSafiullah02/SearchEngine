ZIKV was first isolated from rhesus monkeys near the Zika Forest in Uganda in 1947 [1,2]. The viral genome of ZIKV encodes a polyprotein which consists of a capsid, a premembrane/membrane, an envelope, and seven nonstructural proteins: NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4 B, and NS5 [3]. In recent years, ZIKV infection has become a serious and escalating threat to global health. For example, ZIKV spread rapidly in 2015 in at least 33 regions and countries in Central and South America, such as Brazil, becoming an epidemic that affected between 0.5 and 1.5 million people [[4], [5], [6], [7]]. ZIKV infection has been associated with several neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults and microcephaly in infants [8,9].",

However, as the 2015 outbreak identified, when pregnant women are infected with ZIKV, their babies can be born with serious birth defects, such as fetal growth restrictions as well as neurological and ocular abnormalities. In some cases, ZIKV during pregnancy can even led to perinatal death [10]. ZIKV is also known to cause a benign febrile illness in approximately 18% of infected individuals. This illness leads to symptoms which are similar to those of other arbovirus infections, including DENV and the chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Specifically, these symptoms include fever, rash, joint pain, conjunctivitis, and less commonly, headaches, vomiting and jaundice [11]. Other clinical symptoms typical of ZIKV infection include fever, headaches, joint pain, conjunctivitis, and macular atrophy [12].",

Strategies of fighting ZIKV infection include the development of vaccines and the screening of antiviral agents that inhibit different stages of the viral life cycle [14]. Unfortunately, no approved antiviral ZIKV agents are currently available. There is thus an urgent need to develop safe and effective antiviral agents against ZIKV and to elucidate their mechanisms. Doing so should help identify lead compounds which have the potential for further clinical development in the fight against ZIKV.",

CET has shown promising antiviral activities against hepatitis B [16] and has also been found to have antileukemic activities [17]. Due to their wide range of effects, CET drugs are also believed to have great potential in the treatment of other diseases, including some cancers [18]. HT inhibits CHIKV replication by down-regulating viral protein expression, while HHT shows activity against HBV and the coronavirus. Previous research further determined that both HT and HHT are promising candidates for the treatment of diseases related to the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) [16,[19], [20], [21]]. Although such drugs have similar structures, their substituents vary widely, which may translate into differences in pharmacological activity [21]. Therefore, in the current study, we opted to investigate the potential anti-ZIKV activity of CET in Vero cells. Our results indicate that CET indeed possesses anti-ZIKV activity. Thus, we also opted to investigate the potential mechanisms which underlie the anti-ZIKV activity of CET. In so doing, we demonstrated that CET (1) disrupts the viral life cycle by preventing ZIKV from replicating and (2) exhibits virucidal activity against ZIKV. These findings suggest that CET has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent against ZIKV.",

Therefore, to further investigate the mechanism which underlies the ability of CET to inhibit ZIKV, we performed a time of addition assay. For this, 60 \u03bcM CET was added to Vero cells in pre-treatment, co-treatment, post-treatment, and full-duration treatment groups. (Cells in all groups were infected with 8000 FFU ZIKV per well for 1 h) Following the end of the infection period, cells were washed two times and the medium was replaced. After 24 h incubation, cells were lysed for RNA analysis, and the supernatant was collected for FFU assays. Results of this analysis revealed that CET likely affects the late stage of ZIKV infection (Fig. 3\nA and B), which means that the inhibitory effects of CET likely occur after virus entry. To investigate CET inhibition after ZIKV entry, Vero cells were infected with ZIKV, washed with PBS to remove viruses that had not infected the cells, and then treated with indicated concentrations of CET. Cell lysates and supernatants were collected after 24 h incubation for further analysis. Results showed that administering CET after the initial infection (i.e., the post-treatment group) suppressed viral RNA replication. In particular, when cells in the post-treatment group were administered 40 or 80 \u03bcM CET, ZIKV RNA levels were significantly reduced (Fig. 3C). FFU assays further revealed that the viral yield decreased in the post-treatment group when cells were administered 20, 40, or 80 \u03bcM CET (Fig. 3D). In addition, virucidal assays showed that CET affected virus stability. FFU assays, in which cells were incubated with supernatant containing 50,000 FFU ZIKV with or without 40 \u03bcM CET at room temperature for 6 h prior to detection, revealed that CET decreased the virus level after a 6 h incubation (Fig. 3E), further confirming that CET likely possesses the ability to influence virus stability.",

HHT has further been shown to exert antiviral effects against coronavirus (CoV) [20] and HBV [16]. Both HT and HHT are able to inhibit the replication of both RNA and DNA viruses, which indicates that their antiviral activities are most likely due to cellular rather than viral factors and that cellular factors are essential for viral replication. CET esters have been shown to interfere with RNA translation by blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to acceptor sites on the large ribosomal subunit, thereby also blocking the subsequent formation of a peptide bond [21,27]. Moreover, HT has been found to limit the replication of CHIKV by inhibiting large ribosomal subunits and subsequently down-regulating the translation of viral proteins [19]. Similar to previous studies, results of our time of addition assay showed that CET affected the late stage of ZIKV infection (Fig. 3A and B).",

Previous research which investigated VZV determined that both HT and HHT likely employ other mechanisms in inhibiting ZIKV. For example, HT and HHT likely inhibit lytic gene expression and replication, which may in turn interfere with signal transduction pathways and transcription factors involved in VZV lytic gene expression. On the other hand, in herpesviruses (HHVs), HT and HHT are able to block cell cycle progression during the G1/S or G2/M transition, which in turn affects lytic gene expression and replication [29,30]. Thus, the mechanisms by which HT, HHT [21], and CET inhibit VZV replication may involve disrupting the cell cycle of infected cells.",

In the current study, for the post-treatment group (i.e., the Vero cells that received CET after ZIKV-infection), the decreases we observed in viral replication and viral release were the same, which suggest that the primary mechanism by which CET inhibited ZIKV involved viral replication, not virus release. However, the time of addition assay showed that the viral yield of the full-duration treatment group was lower than that of the post-treatment group (by approximately 0.5 logs, Fig. 3B). This finding suggests that not only can CET disrupt viral replication, but it may also possess other anti-ZIKV activities. To determine this, we performed a virucidal assay of CET, the results of which confirmed that CET decreased viral stability, thereby reducing viral yield (Fig. 3E). In summary, our data indicate that CET is able to inhibit ZIKV infection by affecting both viral replication and viral stability.",
