It is predicted that the development of a safe and effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19 will take 12 to 18 months, by which time many millions of people may have been infected. With a rapidly growing number of cases and deaths around the world, such emerging threats require a nimble and targeted means of protection. Because coronaviruses causing COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are able to spontaneously transfer to humans from diverse animal hosts that act as viral reservoirs, there is a pressing need to develop methods to broadly combat other coronaviruses that may emerge in the future (Li et al., 2005, Mohd et al., 2016, Shi and Hu, 2008). A recent report showed two strains (L and S) of SARS-CoV-2 with different genomic sequences are circulating and likely evolving, further highlighting the need for a pan-coronavirus targeting strategy (Tang et al., 2020).",

The SARS-CoV-2 life cycle is likely similar to the closely related coronavirus that causes SARS, in which the virus enters the cell, releases its RNA genome into the cytoplasm, and synthesizes negative-sense genomic and subgenomic RNAs from which viral mRNAs and new copies of the positive sense viral genome are synthesized (Figure 1\nA) (Du et al., 2009, Liu, 2014). Whereas most ongoing vaccine trials work by priming the human immune system to recognize coronavirus proteins or attenuated viruses and decrease viral entry into cells (Rappuoli, 2018), the alternative antiviral approach we propose here relies on a CRISPR-based system for recognizing and degrading the intracellular viral genome and its resulting viral mRNAs (Figure 1B). Targeting the positive-sense genome and viral mRNAs to simultaneously degrade viral genome templates for replication and viral gene expression would be expected to robustly limit viral replication.",

            "text": "To inhibit RNA viruses in human cells, we used the class 2 type VI-D CRISPR-Cas13d system derived from Ruminococcus flavefaciens XPD3002, a recently discovered RNA-guided RNA endonuclease (Konermann et al., 2018, Yan et al., 2018). Cas13d employs CRISPR-associated RNAs (crRNAs) that contain a customizable 22-nt spacer sequence that can direct the Cas13d protein to specific RNA molecules for targeted RNA degradation. The high catalytic activity of Cas13d in human cells provides a potential mechanism for targeting SARS-CoV-2 for specific viral RNA genome degradation and viral gene expression inhibition. Because of its small size (967 amino acids), high specificity, and strong catalytic activity, we chose Cas13d rather than other Cas13 proteins to target and destroy RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) (Gootenberg et al., 2018, Smargon et al., 2017, Yan et al., 2018). While this is not the first study to use a Cas13 variant to target viral sequences in human cells (Bawage et al., 2018, Freije et al., 2019), it remains unknown whether CRISPR tools can be designed to effectively target and cleave SARS-CoV-2 sequences. In addition, our approach differs from previous studies in that we aim to develop a strategy for simultaneously targeting multiple species of viruses within the same family to provide broad, pan-coronavirus protection.",

            "text": "In this work, we developed a prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells (PAC-MAN) strategy as a form of genetic intervention to target SARS-CoV-2, IAV, and potentially all coronaviruses. We created a bioinformatic pipeline to define highly conserved regions across many sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes and target these regions using CRISPR-Cas13d for viral sequence degradation. At the time of manuscript submission, we were unable to gain access to live SARS-CoV-2 strains. Therefore, we tested our approach using synthesized fragments of SARS-CoV-2, as well as with live infection using an H1N1 IAV strain in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened a panel of crRNA pools targeting conserved viral regions and defined the most effective crRNAs. We demonstrated the ability of our approach to cleave SARS-CoV-2 fragments and to reduce the amount of IAV infection in human lung epithelial cells. Our bioinformatics analysis revealed a group of six crRNAs that can target 91% of sequenced coronaviruses, as well as a group of 22 crRNAs able to target all sequenced coronaviruses. Through the use of crRNA pools targeting different regions of the same virus or different strains of coronavirus, this system could possibly buffer against viral evolution and escape as well as be used to protect against future related pathogenic viruses. While there are remaining hurdles to overcome before this strategy can be used clinically, PAC-MAN has the potential to become a new antiviral strategy.",

Our analysis found regions with high conservation between 47 SARS-CoV-2 strains, as well as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genomes (Figure 2\nA).

We also wanted to create a robust set of crRNAs to guard against loss of targeting activity by mutational escape.",

In contrast to SARS-CoV-2, which has only a single, continuous RNA genome, the IAV genome is contained in eight negative-sense RNA segments, in which each plays an important role in packaging the viral RNA into budding virions (Breen et al., 2016, Zhou et al., 2009). Previous work has shown that IAV can be inhibited using Cas13b in A549 and MDCK cells at a low MOI by targeting somewhat conserved regions (up to 2 bases with <95% allele frequency per crRNA) (Freije et al., 2019).

To do this, we transfected a pool of six crRNAs targeting a given IAV genome segment. Two days after crRNA transfection, the Cas13d A549 cells were challenged with PR8-mNeon, a strain of H1N1 IAV (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) engineered to express the mNeonGreen gene, a fluorescent reporter protein (hereafter referred to as PR8-mNeon) at an MOI of 2.5 or 5.0 (Harding et al., 2017, Heaton et al., 2017, Shaner et al., 2013). At approximately 18 h post-challenge, the cells were analyzed for IAV infection through flow cytometry and microscopy. We examined the percentage of cells that were mNeon positive for each segment-targeting crRNA pool and calculated the fold-change compared to cells transfected with a pool of non-targeting crRNAs). Notably, our study used high MOIs (2.5 or 5) compared to previous Cas13 work that used an MOI of 0.1 or 0.01 (Bawage et al., 2018, Freije et al., 2019). A high MOI is required to get an appropriate dynamic range to detect inhibition of IAV by flow cytometry and allows for the evaluation of crRNA robustness under stringent high-titer infection conditions.",

Additionally, the crRNA pool targeting segment 4 (S4), which encodes the hemagglutinin protein, also showed moderate but consistent inhibition. We further confirmed Cas13d-mediated inhibitory effects on S4 and S6 at a lower MOI of 0.5. We saw strong inhibition of IAV (59% and 78%) targeting S4 and S6, respectively (Figure S4C).

Thus, the design of a strategy that could broadly target and prevent viral threats, including all coronavirus strains that currently reside in animals, would be an invaluable resource. We asked whether it is possible to design a minimal number of crRNAs that could target a majority of known coronaviruses found in both humans and animals. In contrast to previous Cas13 antiviral work (Freije et al., 2019), which focused on conservation across different strains for the same species of virus, we sought to target as many strains as possible with a minimal set of crRNAs to create an even broader level of protection against a given family of viruses.",

There are several attractive delivery options that could be employed for the in vivo expression of PAC-MAN components. Cas13d and its cognate crRNAs could be delivered in RNA form within chemical polymers or lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (Hendel et al., 2015, McKinlay et al., 2017, Sago et al., 2018, Xu et al., 2019). DNA-based liposomal delivery strategies, such as lipitoids or the recently developed HEDGES platform, are also attractive (Handumrongkul et al., 2019, Huang et al., 1998). Another strategy would be to deliver a ribonucleoprotein complex containing the Cas13d protein assembled with crRNAs (Amirkhanov and Stepanov, 2019, Xu et al., 2019). Other work successfully used engineered amphiphilic peptides to deliver Cas9-guide RNA complexes to airway epithelia, which provides a promising approach for delivering PAC-MAN Cas13d complexes (Krishnamurthy et al., 2019). In addition, recent advances in gene therapy delivery strategies optimized for cystic fibrosis that can deliver mRNA or plasmid DNA, such as self-assembled peptide-poloxamine nanoparticles, may also be an option (Guan et al., 2019). We anticipate that one of the above-mentioned strategies can potentially be administered to patients or healthy populations via a nebulizer system or nasal spray as an antiviral strategy.",

For instance, PAC-MAN acts in a cell-autonomous manner, meaning that only cells that express Cas13d and crRNAs are directly protected against the targeted viruses. For PAC-MAN to be effective in patients, it needs to be able to be sufficiently expressed in a certain percentage of cells, the range of which would need to be determined experimentally. In addition, our own work has shown that SARS-CoV-2 sequence cleavage efficiency is sensitive to crRNA expression (Figure S3B). The ability to tune the levels of Cas13d and its cognate crRNAs in the cell may be important to achieving efficient viral inhibition. As another consideration, viral genomes may be less susceptible to inhibition due to the secondary structure of the RNA genome or coating with protective proteins. To address this, high-throughput screening of crRNAs may help identify highly effective crRNAs targeting live SARS-CoV-2. With optimization and further testing, these limitations may prove surmountable.",

The potential for pan-coronavirus protection using CRISPR-Cas13d offers an alternative and complementary approach over traditional pharmaceuticals or vaccines. Traditional vaccines rely on priming the immune system through exposure to viral proteins or peptides often derived from surface proteins that exhibit a high rate of mutation, which increases the chances of viral evasion of the host immune response (Carrat and Flahault, 2007). In contrast, here, we have demonstrated a genetic strategy that is able to target highly conserved regions, which would be expected to make it much less likely for the virus to escape inhibition through mutation. In addition, the ability of Cas13d to process its own crRNAs from a crRNA array means that multiple crRNAs targeting different regions (e.g., Figure 3E, and PAC-MAN-T6 in Figure 5A) could be delivered simultaneously (Konermann et al., 2018), further reducing the chances of viral escape. As a further advantage, we demonstrate a potential pan-coronavirus strategy to target not only viruses that circulate in humans, but also those that are found in animal reservoirs. If the crRNAs targeting these viruses can be tested and validated before they ever infect humans, we can greatly accelerate the development of countermeasures for future emergent threats.",

To characterize the specificity of 22-nt crRNAs, we ensured that crRNA do not target any sequences in the human transcriptome.

A hash table was used to map each crRNA candidate to the number of Coronavirinae genomes that it targets with a perfect match. A greedy algorithm was used to identify a minimal set of covering crRNAs. In each iteration, the crRNAs were sorted in descending order by the number of genomes targeted. The crRNA that targeted the most genomes was added to the minimal set of crRNAs, and all of the genomes it targeted were removed from the hash table values. If multiple crRNAs were tied for targeting the most genomes, the crRNAs were ranked by the length and quantity of stretches of repeated nucleotides, and the lowest ranking crRNA (i.e., the one with the fewest, shortest stretches of repeated nucleotides) was added to the set of minimal crRNAs. Using this approach, a set of 22 crRNAs were identified that were able to target all 3,051 Coronavirinae virus genomes (including 47 SARS-CoV-2).
