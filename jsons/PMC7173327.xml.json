            "text": "RNA viruses utilize their genomes not only as templates to produce more viral RNA progeny during replication, but for many other processes, such as translation, regulation of replication, encapsidation and movement from cell to cell. The folding of viral RNAs in biologically relevant conformation is important because the RNA can be trapped in one of many incorrect/nonfunctional structures (Russell, 2008). However, RNA-binding proteins, such as helicases, RNA chaperones and cofactors, which facilitate conformational transitions of RNA, thus preventing the deleterious effect of RNA misfolding, have been proposed to play auxiliary roles in most steps during the viral infection process. Unlike larger RNA viruses, small plus-strand (+)RNA viruses with genomes less than 6000 nt do not code for RNA helicases (Koonin and Dolja, 1993). This prompted discussions if these small RNA viruses might not need helicases with robust unwinding functions for their replication or, alternatively, they might recruit RNA helicases(s) from the host. Another alternative possibility is that these RNA viruses might code for RNA chaperones, which are also capable of unwinding/destabilizing RNA structures (Cristofari and Darlix, 2002, Zuniga et al., 2009). Accordingly, viral-coded RNA chaperones have been shown to participate in the replication of picornaviruses, coronaviruses, flaviviruses and hepatitis delta virus (DeStefano and Titilope, 2006, Huang and Wu, 1998, Ivanyi-Nagy et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2003, Zuniga et al., 2010), or affect the packaging of coronaviruses, hepatitis C virus, retroviruses and minus-stranded RNA viruses (Cristofari et al., 2004, Cruceanu et al., 2006, Ivanyi-Nagy et al., 2006, Levin et al., 2005, Mir and Panganiban, 2006a, Mir and Panganiban, 2006b, Rein et al., 1998, Zuniga et al., 2007). Host-coded RNA chaperones have also been shown to affect calicivirus and viroid RNA replication (Daros and Flores, 2002, Karakasiliotis et al., 2006). The unique feature of RNA chaperones is that they do not require rNTPs for destabilizing RNA structures, but instead, they bind cooperatively to the RNA and leads to structural changes in the RNA. Thus, RNA chaperones will profoundly affect the folding process, interactions between RNAs and the accessibility of the RNA to other proteins (Russell, 2008, Zuniga et al., 2009).",

            "text": "One group of small plus-stranded RNA viruses, which does not code for RNA helicases, is tombusviruses. These viruses, including Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and Cucumber necrosis virus (CNV), code for an essential RNA-binding protein, termed p33, which is known to affect many steps during the infection process. For example, an essential function of p33 is to bind a C\u00b7C mismatch within an internal cis-acting stem-loop element that leads to selective recruitment of the viral RNA into replication (Monkewich et al., 2005, Pogany et al., 2005). p33 is also involved in the formation of spherule-like structures on the cytoplasmic interface of peroxisomal membranes, which represent the site of viral RNA replication (McCartney et al., 2005, Navarro et al., 2006, Panavas et al., 2005). Its role in viral pathogenesis has also been documented (Burgyan et al., 2000). In addition to the RNA-binding domain, p33 also contains two short p33:p33/p92pol interaction domains that are likely important for the assembly of the viral replicase and for RNA-binding, too (Panaviene et al., 2003, Pogany et al., 2005, Rajendran and Nagy, 2004). Phosphorylation close to the RNA-binding domain is thought to regulate the function of p33 during replication (Shapka et al., 2005, Stork et al., 2005). Overall, the essential p33 seems to be the master regulator of the tombusvirus replication process (Nagy, 2008, Nagy and Pogany, 2006, Nagy and Pogany, 2008).",

            "text": "Depending on the protein and RNA concentrations, mutations or the composition of the buffer, the tombusvirus p33 auxiliary protein has been shown to bind to the viral RNA either specifically or non-specifically (Pogany et al., 2005, Rajendran and Nagy, 2003). The specific interaction between p33 and the viral RNA is required for the recruitment of the TBSV (+)RNA to the membrane-bound replicase complex (Monkewich et al., 2005, Pogany et al., 2005). However, after the selective (+)RNA recruitment, the function of p33 could be different within the viral replicase complex, where p33 is present in high amount, reaching ~ 10\u201320-fold excess over the p92pol (Rajendran and Nagy, 2006, Serva and Nagy, 2006). The high local concentration of p33 within the replicase complex could facilitate non-specific binding of p33 to the viral RNA in a cooperative manner (Rajendran and Nagy, 2003), possibly allowing p33 to function as an RNA chaperone within the replicase complex. Therefore, based on cooperative RNA-binding ability of p33, we speculated that p33 might be able to perform many functions during infection by acting as an RNA chaperone that modifies the structure of the viral RNA to allow the participation of the viral RNA in different ribonucleoprotein complexes. To test this hypothesis, we performed biochemical experiments with purified recombinant p33 using in vitro assays. The purified p33 was shown to efficiently unwind short ssDNA/ssRNA duplexes, render double-stranded (ds)RNA templates sensitive to S1 nuclease, and stimulate self-cleavage by a ribozyme in vitro. We have demonstrated that p33 can promote initiation of RNA synthesis by up to 5-fold by a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in vitro. Based on these data, we propose a role for the RNA chaperone activity of p33 during tombusvirus replication.",

A 21-nt ssDNA oligo was 5\u2032 end labeled and annealed with the unlabeled full-length DI-72(\u2212)RNA, followed by the addition of purified TBSV p33 (Fig. 1B). We have found that 45\u201375% of ssDNA/ssRNA duplex was separated by p33 when present at high concentration (Fig. 1C, lane 3 and 1D, lane 6) in the absence of ATP. On the other hand, the N-terminally truncated TCV p88 RdRp, termed p88C, lacking the p33 similarity domain (Fig. 1A) did not show unwinding activity at a detectable level (Fig. 1C, lane 4), even at the highest concentration (Figs. 1D\u2013E). Since p88C is an RNA-binding protein and it can efficiently use DI-72(\u2212)RNA as a template (Cheng et al., 2005, Rajendran and Nagy, 2003, Rajendran et al., 2002), the lack of unwinding activity by p88C shows that RNA-binding to the template by an RNA-binding protein alone is not sufficient for strand separation in this assay. This is further supported by the lack of RNA chaperone activity by the N-terminally truncated p33, termed p33C (supplementary Fig. S1A\u2013C), which has strong RNA-binding capacity (Pogany et al., 2005, Rajendran and Nagy, 2003).",

However, the strand separation activity of p33 was much weaker than that of Ded1p DEAD-box RNA helicase, which was capable of complete separation of the ssDNA/ssRNA duplex (Fig. 1E, lanes 10\u201311). As expected, ATP stimulated the unwinding activity of Ded1p helicase (Fig. 1E, lane 10 versus Fig. 1D, lane 10), while ATP had no major effect on the strand separation activity of p33 (Fig. 1C, lane 3 and Fig. 1D, lanes 5\u20136 versus 1E, lanes 5\u20136) or p88 (1D, lanes 2\u20133 versus 1E, lanes 3\u20134).

This property of the RNA chaperones are due to refolding of the ribozyme sequence trapped in non-active conformations. To test the effect of p33 on ribozyme activity, we used the self-cleaving ribozyme of satellite Tobacco ringspot virus (Buzayan et al., 1986, Panavas and Nagy, 2003) in the presence of recombinant p33 (Fig. 3A). We have found that the purified p33 stimulated the ribozyme activity by ~ 4-fold, reducing the amount of uncleaved RNA and increasing the amount of self-cleaved RNAs (Fig. 3B, lane 3 versus lane 1).

We have chosen a heterologous RdRp derived from the closely related TCV for these studies since the TBSV or other tombusvirus p92pol RdRp is not active in vitro (Fig. 1). Since the full-length p88 RdRp protein of TCV functions as a weak RNA chaperone by itself (Fig. 1), we used the N-terminally-truncated p88C, which lacks RNA chaperone activity in vitro (Fig. 1), yet it is a highly active RdRp on ssRNA templates in vitro (Panavas et al., 2006, Rajendran et al., 2002). Altogether, a major advantage of using this heterologous system is that the tombusvirus p33 does not interact directly with TCV p88C (Rajendran and Nagy, 2004), thus making it unlikely that any stimulatory effect of p33 on p88C RdRp activity would be due to direct enhancement of RdRp activity via protein\u2013protein interaction (i.e., due to p33 acting like a transcription factor). Rather, the most probable way for p33 to affect the RdRp activity of p88C is to alter the structure of the RNA template via the RNA chaperone activity of p33.",

This enhancement is not due to stabilization of p88C by p33 because the activity of p88C on template dsDI-72(5\u2032\u039469) with an unbase-paired ssRNA tail including the cPR promoter was decreased by the addition of p33 (Fig. 5B, lanes 11\u201320).

The easiest interpretation of these data is that p33, due to its RNA chaperone activity, facilitates the initiation step for p88C RdRp by opening up the stable secondary structure within the cPR sequence in the dsRNA template, which is then used more efficiently by p88C that lacks RNA chaperone activity.",

To test if the chaperone activity of p33 could promote initiation on the (+)RNA template, we used DI-72(+) in our standard p88C RdRp assay in the presence of various amounts of recombinant p33. The RdRp assay revealed that p33 enhanced initiation on the (+)RNA template by ~ 2-fold (Fig. 6B), suggesting that p33 can facilitate opening up the base-pairs formed between the silencer and promoter, thus likely facilitating the loading of the viral RdRp on the (+)RNA template. However, the RNA chaperone activity of p33 is rather inefficient on the DI-72(+)RNA, thus it is possible that host factors, such as elongation factor 1A, which is recruited for tombusvirus replication, might also be involved in minus-strand initiation (Li et al., 2009).",

            "text": "A large group of small RNA viruses codes for auxiliary replication proteins that lack helicase/ATPase motifs. Among these is the essential p33 replication protein of tombusviruses, which has essential functions in RNA replication (Nagy and Pogany, 2006, White and Nagy, 2004). The ability of p33 to bind to the viral RNA is critical during tombusvirus replication and it also affects viral RNA recombination (Jaag et al., 2007, Panaviene et al., 2003, Panaviene and Nagy, 2003). Interestingly, p33 can bind to the viral RNA in two different fashions. The first type of RNA-binding by p33 is specific to a region in the plus-stranded TBSV RNA termed RII(+)-SL with a signature C\u00b7C mismatch (also termed p33 recognition element) (Monkewich et al., 2005, Pogany et al., 2005). This specific p33-RNA interaction requires small amount of p33, likely in the form of p33 dimer (Pogany et al., 2005). The above specific p33-TBSV (+)RNA interaction is critical for the selective recognition of the TBSV RNA and TBSV replication both in vivo (Monkewich et al., 2005, Pogany et al., 2005) and in vitro in a cell-free extract prepared from yeast (Pogany and Nagy, 2008, Pogany et al., 2008). The second type of RNA-binding is non-specific binding of p33 to ssRNA and ssDNA, and to a lesser extent to dsRNA (Rajendran and Nagy, 2003). This non-specific nucleic acid binding by p33 requires high concentration of p33 and occurs in a cooperative manner (Rajendran and Nagy, 2003). We envision that the non-specific RNA-binding activity of p33 is important within the assembled, membrane-bound tombusvirus replicase complex, which contains large amount of p33 and only the selectively recruited TBSV (+)RNA in addition to p92pol and host factors (Nagy, 2008, Nagy and Pogany, 2010, Serva and Nagy, 2006). Within this context, the RNA chaperone activity of p33 could be important for tombusvirus replication (see below).",

Further evidence for the RNA chaperone activity of the purified p33 is the requirement for the RNA-binding regions in p33 for RNA chaperone activity (Fig. 5C), suggesting that p33 must interact with the RNA template in order to function as a chaperone.",

The use of the heterologous p88C RdRp with the TBSV p33 [these proteins do not interact in vitro (Rajendran and Nagy, 2004)] in the above assays makes it unlikely that the stimulatory effect of p33 on TCV p88C RdRp activity using dsRNA templates is due to activation/stimulation of p88C RdRp via protein\u2013protein interaction.

This leads to unwinding (unfolding) of the bound segment of the RNA, which then can refold to a new conformation (Tompa and Csermely, 2004). To predict if p33 replication protein contains naturally disordered regions, we used PONDR VL-XT (Bracken et al., 2004, Romero et al., 1997, Romero et al., 2004). As shown in Fig. 7\n, the p33 replication proteins of five tombusviruses were predicted to contain a long and a shorter naturally disordered regions. These disordered regions contain two separate RNA-binding sequences (supplementary Fig. S1) (Panaviene et al., 2003, Rajendran and Nagy, 2003). Altogether, the presence of conserved naturally disordered regions in the p33 replication proteins further support the model that p33 functions as an RNA chaperone.",

Since p33 could not separate the dsRNA strands in the 621 bp long dsDI-72 RNA (not shown), we propose that p33 has a weak RNA chaperone activity, which might only be enough to open up dsRNA form from the end carrying the AU-rich stretch (within the plus-strand initiation promoter, Fig. 5) or the short silencer\u2013promoter structure (Figs. 6A and B). Indeed, providing a weaker dsRNA structure in dsDI72(5\u2032m3\u20138) (Fig. 5D), which has a \u201cRNA-bubble structure\u201d (Panavas et al., 2006), led to 5-fold enhanced RdRp activity by the TCV p88C due to the RNA chaperoning activity of p33. It is plausible that p88C cannot unwind the dsRNA regions due to lacking RNA chaperone activity (Fig. 1) and that results in inefficient loading of the RdRp on the dsRNA template. However, p33 might help opening up the dsRNA structure from the \u201cweaker\u201d AU-rich end, followed by loading the RdRp and then plus-strand synthesis (Fig. 8\n). Indeed, we have shown previously that both the tombusvirus replicase and p88 RdRp can only open up the \u201cleft-side\u201d of the dsRNA carrying the AU-rich stretch. Thus, our in vitro data indicate that the primary function of p33 as an RNA chaperone is to facilitate initiation of RNA synthesis by making the promoter regions accessible to the viral RdRp. Unwinding of additional internal RNA structures might be accomplished by the viral RdRp during RNA synthesis as demonstrated earlier (Panavas et al., 2006). Interestingly, binding of p33 or p33C to ssRNA regions actually inhibited RdRp activity (Fig. 5B, lanes 11\u201320 and S1C). This suggests that p33 and especially p33C bound strongly to the ssRNA might hinder RdRp activity. Based on this and other data, we propose that the RNA chaperone activity of p33 affects plus-strand synthesis and possibly also contributes to minus-strand synthesis via facilitating initiation (Fig. 8). Future in vitro assembly approaches should help to address this and related questions.",

We predict that the RNA chaperone function of p33 replication protein is involved in opening the closed silencer\u2013promoter structure, which then leads to minus-strand synthesis by the tombusvirus replicase (Step 1) However, the RNA chaperone activity of p33 is rather inefficient on the (+)RNA template, thus it is possible that host factors, such as elongation factor 1A, which is recruited for tombusvirus replication, might also be involved in minus-strand initiation. More importantly, p33 is likely involved in opening up the AU-rich terminus of the putative dsRNA replication intermediate (Step 2). We propose that binding of p33 to dsRNA could facilitate loading of the replicase to the open AU-rich end in the dsRNA replication intermediate, followed by initiation of plus-strand synthesis (bottom). It is likely that binding of p33 could stabilize the open structure within the AU-rich stretch in the cPR promoter as shown. After initiation, the tombusvirus replicase can efficiently unwind the remaining part of the dsRNA template during RNA synthesis as demonstrated earlier (Panavas et al., 2006).",
