Carbapenem antibiotic are regarded as the most effective treatment. However numbers of authors suggest that alternatives antibiotics (i.e. noncarbapenems) could be used in ESBL-PE infections.

The median SOFA Score at first day of antibiotic therapy and ICU admission were 7 (4-11) and 7 (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) respectively. The most frequent site of infection were respiratory tract (45%), urinary tract (20%) and abdominal (17%). The most frequent isolated species were: Escherichia coli (43%), Klebsiella sp (37%) and Enterobacter sp (18%). Respectively 50, 23 and 27% patients had septic shock, severe sepsis and sepsis according to Bone criteria. Among ESBL-PE, 98.6% were carbapenem and 46.5 were BLBI sensitive. Among the whole population, 47 (48%) patients received a carbapenems as ET. 66 (68%) received a DT with carbapenems and 31 (32%) patients received an alternative DT. The most frequent reasons for maintaining carbapenems as DT were: Antibiotic susceptibility tests (38% of cases), severity level (33% of cases) immunosuppression (8% of cases). The Median length of ICU stay after infection was respectively 12 (6-27) and 11 (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) days for carbapenems and alternatives DT (p = 0.1). The D28 mortality was 24% for patients with carbapenems DT and 24% for patients with alternatives DT (p = 0.02). Surprisingly, there were no differences between the 2 groups (carbapenems vs alternatives) in term of severity. Conclusion Alternatives are frequently used for ESBL-PE infections in ICU.

However, in French Guyana, there is no data on the epidemiology of colonization and infection caused by extended spectrum B-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE). We conducted this study to investigate the prevalence of colonization with ESBL-PE and subsequent ICU acquired infection in French Guiana. Introduction The implementation of hemofiltration (HF) as a renal replacement therapy in septic shock patients requires the supply of large quantities of replacement solutions. These solutions are either industrially prepared in autoclaved expensive plastic bags (conventional hemofiltration, CHF) or continuously provided in unlimited amounts at the dialysis machine directly from the water treatment plant to form the replacing solutions (on-line hemofiltration, OLHF).The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of on-line hemofiltration compared to conventional hemofiltration in septic shock patients.",

A decisional tree was built to modelize the impact of AT on the consumption of hemofiltration devices and blood products. The decisional tree took into account the probability of membrane thrombosis with and without AT and the probability of transfusion after membrane thrombosis. Costs were obtained from the pharmacy of the institution (AT, hemofiltration devices) and from the literature (blood products). Results During 2011, 77 days of hemofiltration were performed, with the use of 45 doses of AT (23,202\u20ac) and 76 hemofiltration devices (11,632\u20ac) . During 2012, 76 (\u22121%) days of hemofiltration were performed, with the use of 5 (\u221289%) doses of AT (2578\u20ac) and 85 (+10%) hemofiltration devices (13,443\u20ac) . The mean cost of 1 day of hemofiltration decreased from 449\u20ac to 211\u20ac with the diminution of the use of AT. According to the decisional tree, AT was almost never cost-effective. The only circumstances associated with a benefit for the use of AT was the association of a probability of thrombosis with AT inferior to 0.1, of a probability of thrombosis without AT equal 1, of a probability of transfusion after thrombosis equal 1 and a cost of transfusion of 424\u20ac. In these extremely favorable circumstances, AT could decrease the daily cost of hemofiltration of 2.22-19.30\u20ac. Discussion The model has several limits: the losses of utility related to transfusion and to interruption of hemofiltration due to thrombosis were not taken into account; the cost of AT measurement was not estimated; the work load of changing a membrane and of transfusion after membrane thrombosis was not analyzed. Conclusion Our results suggest that anti-thrombin is not costeffective to reduce the costs of hemofiltration related to membrane thrombosis.",

It requires the circuit anticoagulation, this could be done by a regional citrate method. Today, this is a recommended approach for the everyday care, even if the technique isn't widespread yet [1] . The ionized calcemia dosing through the filter (\"post-filter\" ionized-calcemia) is used to monitor the technique efficacy, with a target of 0.25-0.35 mmol/L showing a good filter anticoagulation. The objective of our study was the assessment of efficacy and safety of our regional citrate anticoagulation protocol, with a less restrictive post-filter ionized calcemia target (0.3-0.6 mmol/L). The main goal was the analysis of the circuit lifespan, considering a lifespan above 24 h, as well as the search of some clinical and biological factors affecting the technique efficacy. Moreover, we analyzed the side effects incidence of the protocol (hypernatremia, metabolic alcalosis), and their consequences. The study received the scientific ethical agreement of University Hospital of Toulouse, and is registered with number 18-0214. Patients and methods 57 patients, admitted to one of the two University Hospital ICUs of Toulouse, needing a continuous RRT method, without any need for systemic heparin anticoagulation, and without severe hepatocellular failure, were included in the study. 103 filters included over a 1-year period were analyzed. Results Results show a mean filter lifespan of 48 h, with a lifespan above 24 h for 85.4% of all filters. Coagulation was the cessation reason for 29.1% of filters, most of them before 24 h of the filter use. A value of post-filter ionized calcemia at day 1 below 0.54 mmol/L was the main factor influencing a filter lifespan above 24 h. An age older than 51 and a SAPS II severity score below 80 were other factors conditioning a filter lifespan of more than 24 h. Side effects of citrate were rare and didn't have any clinical impact among our patients. Discussion These results suggest that citrate used for anticoagulation in RRT could have an additional anti inflammatory effect through the induced hypocalcemia, as well as an energetic gain which could lead to a renal protection against ischemia-reperfusion mechanism [2] . Moreover, these results call into question the need of post-filter ionized calcemia dosing for the monitoring of citrate anticoagulation efficacy, since the method safety is monitored by the total-to-ionized calcium ratio. Conclusion During continuous RRT in ICU, a regional citrate anticoagulation protocol with a non-restrictive post-filter ionized calcemia target seems to be efficient and could reduce side effects. These results need to be confirmed with a randomised control study.",

            "text": "Introduction Continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) is used to treat acute kidney injury in critically ill patients. To optimize its efficiency, CVVH requires effective anticoagulation. Systemic anticoagulation with standard heparin, the most used, can lead to major bleeding complications. Hemofilters that are able to adsorb heparin molecules on their surface such as AN69ST and oXiris membranes represent an alternative. The objective of this study was to compare these two types of filters in terms of duration, efficiency, dysfunctions and cost. Materials and methods From October 2012 to May 2014, we conducted a retrospective, observational, and non-interventional study. All patients admitted in the intensive care unit needing CVVH were included. The primary endpoint was the filter lifespan: AN69ST versus oXiris. The secondary endpoint was the filter efficiency (urea reduction ratio: URR). The main analysis did not consider the anticoagulation type. We conducted a subgroup analysis taking into account the use or not of an anticoagulation. Results 181 sessions in 93 patients were carried out using 386 filters representing 10,706 h of treatment. The mean AN69ST filter lifespan was 27 \u00b1 20 h and 28 \u00b1 22 h for oXiris filters (p > 0.05). There is no significant difference in terms of duration between the two filters. The subgroup analysis taking into consideration the use or not of anticoagulation did not show any difference either. The mean URR was 48 \u00b1 23% in the AN69ST group and 44 \u00b1 25% in the oXiris group (p > 0.05). Concerning the dysfunctions, there were no significant difference between the two filters. One hundred and seventy-six AN69ST filters were used for a total cost of 24,288 euros. Two hundred and ten oXiris filters were used for a total cost of 39,060 euros. Conclusion The AN69ST and oXiris lifespans are not significantly different. They were as efficient in terms of blood epuration and had as many dysfunctions. The use of an oXiris filter rather than an AN69ST to extend the circuit's lifespan in the same clinical conditions is not justified considering the extra cost generated.",

Sex-ratio (M/F) was 1.8. Mean APACHE(II) score was 24 \u00b1 9. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 10 \u00b1 15 days. Thirty patients (34.9%) developed VAP. ICU-mortality was significantly higher in the VAP (+) group (90 vs 55.4%; p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified two independent factors predicting ICU mortality: Shock on admission (OR = 22.7, CI 95% [5.1-101.2], p < 0.001) and VAP (OR = 5.7, CI 95% [1.2-28.1], p = 0.033).

Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, by side effects, misuse, underuse or overuse are very often involved.

Nevertheless, the in-hospital mortality is high compared to the average mortality in our ICU over the same period (20%). The prognosis is often not as poor as initially perceived by physicians. The indication for ICU treatment in our study was mostly justified; in the setting of consistent patient care and good clinical practice. It remains therefore appropriate to discuss every single ICU admission of elderly patients without any restriction related to age. Thus, the ongoing cluster-randomized trial of ICU admissions for the elderly patients (ICE-CUB 2 study) is deeply awaited to confirm or not these results [1] .",

All women who delivered vaginally and showed HPP including the suspected cause was uterine atony were included. The severe PPH was defined as bleeding that required invasive surgical treatment (hysterectomy, arterial ligation), a transfusion, a transfer to an intensive care unit or death of the patient. The quality of care was evaluated using objective criteria defined by a delay of diagnosis and care and mortality. Results Among the 466 women who delivered vaginally during the study period, 23 had a PPH, link with uterine atony alleged at diagnosis, 18 of which presented signs of severity. In 41% of cases, the delay in diagnosis of PPH was less than 30 min; 70% of women received oxytocin within 10 min after diagnosis. The tranexanique acid was used in 1 case. The examination of the cervix, uterine exploration and uterine massage was performed in 67, 99 and 97%, respectively. The failure of first line treatment involved 24% of patients. Among them, the time between the diagnosis of PPH and administration of blood derivatives was greater than 1 h in a third of cases. The administration of oxytocin delay exceeds 10 min multiplied by 2.5 the risk of severe PPH. However we had 2 deaths in our series. Discussion In our study the optimal period of care was not adequate, obtaining blood derivatives in our institution remains among the factors aggravating Among the main risk factors for PPH, uterine atony was the main source of complication. Bleeding postpartum aggravated in our two patients has led to the deaths from late diagnosis and care that was not optimal.

Patients and methods It is a retrospective, monocentric study, performed in a Tunisian intensive care unit (ICU) over a period of 10 years. We including all patients admitted in ICU for AECOPD. Parameters collected were demographic features, comorbidities, regular treatment, dyspnea assessed by the MRC scale, initial clinical severity reflected by SAPS II and APACHE II scores, modalities and ICU admission deadlines, initial arterial blood gas analysis, management of patients in the ICU (ventilation modalities, prescription of antibiotics, use of vasoactive drugs) and their outcomes (incidence of nosocomial infections and their sites, length of stay and ICU mortality). Results A total of 512 patients, which represents 17.5% of all hospitalizations, with mean age of 72 years (IQR: 66-77) were admitted for AECOPD during the study period. The mean SAPS II and APACHE II were respectively 32 (IQR: 24-45) and 18 (IQR: 14-24). Of these, 60% were ventilated with NIV whose overall failure rate was 48% with a significant decrease between the beginning and the end of the study (94 vs 31% p = 0.001). Sixty-four percent of patients received antibiotics at admission. The prescription rate of antibiotics has decreased significantly over the years from 82 to 36%. The incidence of nosocomial infections was 18%. It remained steady between 11 and 27%. Their sites were pulmonary in 83% of cases. ICU mortality was 16%. In multivariate analysis, ICU admission deadlines, NIV failure and the use of vasoactive drugs were identified as factors associated with mortality. Conclusion Our study showed the importance of AECOPD in the activity of our ICU. The management of these patients has evolved over the years, which was reflected by the significant decrease in the prescription of antibiotics and the enhancement of NIV success rate. This result could be attributed to the combination of several factors: precocious management of patients, experience of the healthcare team and the use of efficient ventilators. ICU admission deadlines, NIV failure and the use of vasoactive drugs were identified as factors associated with mortality.",

Results Thirty-six patients were included over the 6 months' study period. Sixty percent of the patients were men with an average age of 38 Two hundred and fifty-one days represents the total number of days of oxygen therapy divided into 142 days of invasive ventilation, 15 days of noninvasive ventilation and 94 days of oxygen mask. The use of pressurized oxygen was necessary 19 times over the 251 days of oxygen therapy which represents 7.5% of the total time. The causes of its use were in ten cases (52.6%) criteria of severe ARDS, in six cases an emergency intubation and in three cases a transfer.

Results During the study period, 194 patients were hospitalized in our ICU and the diagnosis of hyperglycemia (>8 mmol/l) was admitted in 93 patients (48%). The comparison between patients who developed hyperglycemia and those free hyperglycemia group showed that, the patients of the first group were significantly older (p < 0.001). Additionally, hyperglycemic patients had more medical history including history of diabetes (p < 0.001), a higher SAPS II (p < 0.05), a more significant frequency of active infections (p < 0.05). Moreover, the presence of hyperglycemia was associated with shock (p < 0.05) and respiratory distress (p < 0.05).

A number of markers have been developed for the diagnosis of the IRA but costs remain high not allowing their routine use. The measurement of resistance index with the renal Doppler could be a solution for the diagnosis of aggression and also of the etiology. The elevation of creatinine was seen later within 48 h after the IR >90. Discussion In our series the resistance index has a value of early diagnosis of renal prognosis aggression in the occurrence and development of renal failure. Renal doppler associated with a strictly applied standardized protocol achieves the two goals of monitoring who aid in the diagnosis and guide treatment. Although the recommendations of experts to this tool provides that it should probably not use the resistance index measured by renal doppler to diagnose or treat an IRA (Grade 2) [2] . Identifying the cause of kidney aggression is a prerequisite before any therapeutic action. Hypovolemia and soda hydro overload are the causes principales.

PE were started at an average of 1.6 days after foetal extraction, and with an average of 5 sessions. Patients of the PE group had significantly lower nadir of hemoglobin but also lower hemoglobin level at day 2 and day 5. Nadir of platelets count was also lower and level remain lower at days 1, 2, 3 and 5. Acute kidney injury (using Kdigo classification) was more frequent with a higher rate of dialysis in ICU, in the PE group (4/5 (80%) vs 3/33 (9%) p = 0.0022) with a more frequent need for dialysis at the exit of ICU. Proteinuria was significantly higher in the PE group (862.8 mg/mmol vs 308.41 mg/mmol, p = 0.0134). ADAMTS13 dosage was done only in patients with PE. We find a diminution of ADAMTS13 activity (before PE) with an average of 53% [40-70] in this group. There was no death, and adverse effects were not significantly different. Discussion This study shows that PE was used when diagnosis was uncertain in the most severe form of PP-TMA. Low hemoglobin, low platelets, acute kidney injury and high level of proteinuria are the main factors associated with the decision to begin PE. This technique was safe and not associated with major adverse events. Several studies show that there are physiopathological crossovers between diseases associated with PP-TMA, for example low ADAMTS13 activity in HELLP or mutation in alternative complement pathway which induced HELLP. Moreover, studies and case reports show a benefit of PE in HELLP syndrome. Our study did not find significant difference in adverse events (maybe due to a lack of power), but this is another argument to discuss PE in the management of PP-TMA in severe patients. The main limits of our study are that none of the patients who had a plasmatic exchange had a diagnosis of PTT and that diagnosis tests were not performed in all patients with PP-TMA (complements level, ADAMTS13\u2026). Conclusion PP-TMA treated with PE has lower hemoglobin, lower platelets, higher rate of kidney injury and proteinuria than those treated without PE. No difference were found for adverse events.",

We aim to assess its performance to detect lung macrophage recruitment in an experimental highvolume VILI model.

PET/CT acquisitions were performed before (T1) and after 4 h of high-volume ventilation (T2), and image-derived measurements were realized on the whole lungs, and regionally on 6 distinct lung regions (divided along the anteroposterior and the cephalocaudal axes). 11C-PK11195lung uptake was estimated using the Standardized Uptake Value (SUV), normalized to the CT-derived tissue fraction in the region of interest (ROI).

Conclusion Thank-you letters provide both encouraging and informative messages for ICU teams about relational care for patients and families notably the indivisibility of the families and their critically ill loved ones. The relatives' experience of the ICU appears strongly influenced by the caring relationship in the way they express an authentic revelation of their own humanity and altruistic thoughts. The thematic content of thank-you letters questions determinants and fundamental values at stake in the patient-relatives-caregivers relationship.",

Changing behavior has been gradual, while the law offered the patient the freedom to consent to care and then of expressing their wishes regarding the therapeutic intensity they would benefit, in critical situations where consent would not be possible, through advance directives (AD) [1] . Their use is of paramount interest for intensivist in many critical situations. Unfortunately, the use of AD remains marginal because of the unfamiliarity of patients with their use and an appropriation default by clinicians [2] . The aim of our study was to investigate the perspective of the coming family physician generation on advances directives. Patients and methods Population of interest was general practitioner fellow (GPF) from class of 2012 to 2014. We built an online questionnaire survey about knowledge and the place they want to give to AD in their forthcoming daily clinical activity. This questionnaire was sent to GPF emails obtained by universities, unions and via the official mailing lists of different regionals classes provided by the first contacted. Descriptive analysis of quantitative data was expressed as mean and standard deviation, qualitative data in number and percentage. The comparison of continuous variables was performed by the Student t-test and the comparison of categorical variables by a Chi2 test. Analyzes were conducted on BiostaTGV website and Microsoft Excel \u00ae . Results 2310 GPF answered the survey, mainly from Ile de France (n = 218), Toulouse (n = 199) and Lille (n = 169). For GPF the majority of patients do not know the AD (81.6%) and 54% think that those who know do not know how to use it. 88.4% of GPF think writing AD by patients requires better information.",

The number of poisonings has significantly increased since this new indication. Clinical presentation of poisoning mainly includes sedation, hypotonia, respiratory depression and seizures. To characterize the neurorespiratory toxicity of this molecule at high doses, we aimed at investigating alterations in Sprague-Dawley rat ventilation and brain electrical activity after baclofen administration and studied their reversal by GABA-receptor antagonists. Materials and methods Rat ventilation was investigated using plethysmography and arterial blood gas analysis while brain electrical activity was studied using EEG with one implanted frontal electrode. Three baclofen doses were used including 43.5 mg/kg (30% lethal dose-50%), 72.5 mg/kg (50%) and 116 mg/kg (80%). Baclofen concentrations were obtained using HPLC-MSMS assay. We modeled baclofen pharmacokinetics and analyzed the doses/effects and effects/concentrations relationships. Results Baclofen induced early-onset and prolonged dosedependent sedation (p = 0.0002), hypothermia (p = 0.004), EEG and respiratory depression (0.001) characterized by significant increase in the inspiratory (p = 0.0001) and expiratory times (p = 0.02). Significant increase in PaCO 2 and decrease in arterial pH and PaO 2 were observed at 116 mg/kg (p = 0.001), peaking at 240 min. EEG showed signal slowing, burst-suppression aspects and spikes peaking at 5-6 h post-injection without normalization at the end of the experiment at 24 h. We did reverse baclofen-induced decrease in tidal volume with saclofen (a GABA-B receptor antagonist) and interestingly no alteration of baclofen-induced respiratory depression was observed with flumazenil (a GABA-A receptor antagonist). Pharmacokinetic parameters of baclofen were obtained at the three doses and were dose-dependent.

First hypothesis was meningitis receiving uncomplete dosage regimen of antibiotics. Thereafter owing to apparent loss of consciousness with abnormal eyes movements, non-tonico-clonic seizures were considered meanwhile. The ratio of individuals less 5 y-o to those equal to and greater was 33/67%. The male to female ratio was 46/53%. The mean duration of hospitalisation was 3.4 \u00b1 0.8 days (extremes 1-10 days).

The definitive diagnosis made on pictures and videos of children and adults and was facio-troncular dystonia resulting from drug-induced adverse effect. Four urine samples were collected in children and sent to a toxicological laboratory in France. All urine samples were positive for haloperidol meanwhile the other causes of facio-troncular dystonia were excluded, including other neuroleptics, metoclopramide, antidepressants, amodiaquine, anti-histaminic drugs, anti-epileptics, and cocaine. From January to August 2015, 1021 hospitalisations were recorded in 925 patients.

This outbreak resulted from counterfeature of pills sold as diazepam. Toxicological analysis revealed one pill contained about 10 mg of haloperidol. FTDS induced by haloperidol does not result from a drug overdose but is an adverse drug reaction (ADR) occurring in about 20% of patients treated with haloperidol. Nine-hundred and twenty-five individuals were admitted in MSF structures for 1021 FTDS. The ratio of individuals less than 5 y-o and equal to or greater of age was 33/67%, including 35 (3.4%) of children less than 1 y-o. Initial treatment was based on diazepam which relieved FTDS but resulted in long-lasting sedation, preventing given any drug by the oral route. Owing to the definitive diagnosis, a shift to the use of a more specific antidote was chosen. Biperiden was selected as existing in the intravenous and oral form in the Swiss pharmacopea. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Ministery of Health of the Republic Democratic du Congo. Patients and methods As a whole, biperiden was used in 223 cases (84% of the total). Treated children presented with severe dystonia as evidenced by inability to cooperate and to swallow. Verbal informed consent was obtained from relatives. The dosage regimen to treat drug-induced dystonic syndrome in the Swiss pharmacopea is as follows: for parenteral use in children, intravenously or intramuscularly: 0.040 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/m 2 BSA every 30, according to response and tolerance; a maximum of four doses per day should be used. The internal MSF recommendations for biperiden use in children were 0.01-0.05 mg/kg of body weight that might be repeated four times a day. Initially, biperiden administration was administered under medical supervision by the MSF referent at the scene. Results There was no pediatric preparation of biperiden. Accordingly, the adult preparation was used in children. The preparation contained 5 mg of biperiden in one milliter of solvent. The initial planned dose for children of 1 y-o and less and those up to 5 y-o were 1 and 2 mg, respectively. The 5 mg (1 ml) of biperiden was diluted in 4 ml of saline resulting in a final dilution of 1 mg/ml. Six children were treated according this dosage regimen. However, the one 1 mg dose was either of limited efficacy while being associated in others of signs suggestive of ADR, including agitation, heart rate greater than 160 b/ min, the upper limit for children aged of 1 y-o and less. Two children greater than 1 y-o presented severe abnormal behavior resulting in an attempt at escape. Owing to question about safety, the dosage regimen was changed, as follows: 5 mg (1 ml) of biperiden was diluted with 9 ml of saline resulting in a final dilution of 0.5 mg/ml. An initial dose of 0.5 mg was administered intravenously as a bolus dose. The effects were looked for over 15 min. In the absence of improvement in facial dystonia, a second bolus dose of 0.5 mg was administered, a third dose could be considered 15 min later if the FTDS did not resume. The cumulative initial dose should not be greater than 2 mg. In addition to the reversal of facial dystonia, the therapeutic effect of biperiden included the return of swallowing to normal allowing to give further doses of biperiden by the oral route for three days. The first oral dose was administered no less than 12 h after the last initial dose at a dose equal to the efficient initial cumulative dose. The following doses were halved every 12 h. No ADR related to biperiden were reported using this dosage regimen. The mean duration of hospitalisation was 3.4 \u00b1 0.8 days.",

Most of our patients (91%) attended the emergency department of Zaghouan with a non-medical transportation. It was a suicide attempt in most cases (62%) and an accidental poisoning in 32% of patients. The most frequent cause of poisoning in our study was organophosphorus pesticide (n = 24; 75%). The second cause was alpha-chloralose poisoning with seven cases (22%). One patient ingested accidentally an anticoagulant rodenticide. Most of patients had ingested (oral route) the rat poison (n = 23; 78%). Clinical examination found normal vital signs in ten cases (31%). Nine patients (28%) had a shock, eight patients (25%) had an acute metabolic disorder and five patients (16%) had acute respiratory failure or were comatose. All patients enrolled in the study were admitted in the ICU for a period of clinical observation of 24 h. Stomach pumping (gastric lavage) was performed in 30 patients (93%). An antidote which was atropine was needed in twelve patients. Three patients (9%) who ingested alpha-chloralose needed intubation and mechanical ventilation. All patients had a good outcome and were discharged from ICU and from hospital. The mean ICU length of stay was 2 \u00b1 3 days. Conclusion This is the first study of acute poisoning with rodenticides admitted in the new ICU. The results of our study were similar to those published in recent literature.

We conducted a study to determine postoperative complications and morbidity-mortality risk factors in this subgroup of patients. Results Sixty-two patients were included: 25 with out-of-hospital refractory cardiac arrest and 37 with in-hospital refractory arrest. The initial rhythms was shockable rhythm in 25 (40%) cases. At ECLS initiation, the mean no flow was 0.8 \u00b1 3.9 min and mean low flow (time between the time of refractory cardiac arrest and time at which an ECLS flow was provided) was 71 \u00b1 37 min. The mean ECLS flow rate was 4.17 \u00b1 1.31 L/min. Initial blood test results were: arterial pH = 7.04 \u00b1 0.20 and plasma lactate = 12.8 \u00b1 5.9 mmol/L.

OHCA in Adolescents occurred more often on public roads (30%) or in public places (15%) and were more often traumatic (46%) than those in children and adults. Respiratory causes were more frequent in children (27%) than in adolescents (18%) and adults patients (18%). The proportion of shockable rhythm increased with age (3, 7 and 10% for children, adolescents and adults respectively). Survival at D30 was greater in adolescents (12%) than in children (7%) and adults (8%) (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02 respectively). In the 3 studied groups, initial shockable rhythm was a survival factor at D30 (respectively OR 18 [11.39-17.48 ] for children, adolescents and adults). Other risk factors are described in Table 11 . Conclusion Adolescents had better survival at D30 than the 2 others groups. Adolescents and adults had shockable rhythm more often than children. Moreover, respiratory failure was less frequent in adolescent and adults patients compared to children. Puberty seems to be a good limit to differentiate pediatric patients with OHCA.",

Introduction Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an effective alternative to endotracheal mechanical ventilation (MV) in the management of acute respiratory failure (ARF) patients. Nevertheless, it can be still difficult to assess its real feasibility, application and outcome in daily clinical practice. Therefore, we report our clinical experience with routine use of NIV since the last national recommendations (2006). Our aims were to evaluate the clinical efficacy and outcome of NIV, and to identify predictive factors for NIV failure based on a daily use. Patients and methods We conducted an observational retrospective single-center cohort study by reviewing all medical records from January 2006 to December 2013 in our 22-bed medical intensive care unit (ICU). Eligible patients were those having received NIV during their ICU stay. Two groups were defined according to the indication of NIV: NIV for hypoxemic or hypercapnic ARF (ARF-NIV), and NIV used in the post-extubation period for weaning, prevention or treatment of post-extubation ARF (post-extubation NIV).The main evaluation criteria were the incidence of NIV use, success/failure rate of NIV and risk factors for NIV failure in each group. NIV failure was defined as the need for stopping NIV whatever the reason (intubation, intolerance, death) within 3 days after its initiation. (2; 9), and was longer in the post-extubation NIV group (11 days (6; 19) ) than in the ARF-NIV (5 days (3; 9) for hypoxemic ARF, 4 (2; 6) for hypercapnic) (p < 0.001). The overall ICU mortality was 11.0% (15.8% in hypoxemic group, 8.1% in hypercapnic group, and 6.9% in post-extubation NIV group) (p = 0.0005). In multivariate analysis, the main risk factors for ARF-NIV failure were: SAPS II on admission (p < 0.0001), absence of cardiologic history (p = 0.0274) and the cause of ARF (p = 0.0016) with a higher failure rate for pulmonary infections than acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (OR 2.94, p = 0.0004). For post-extubation NIV, the only independent risk factor for failure was normocapnia before NIV initiation (p = 0.0011). Conclusion Our large longitudinal study demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of NIV applied in daily clinical practice. Provided it is performed in a suitable environment by an experienced team, NIV should be considered as a first-line ventilatory treatment in various etiologies of ARF and a very useful ventilatory support in the postextubation period. Nevertheless, risk factors for NIV failure should be known by ICU clinicians, hypoxemic ARF remaining the more difficult indication to manage with NIV. 1 R\u00e9animation m\u00e9dicale, H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; 2 Service de biostatistique et information m\u00e9dicale, H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; 3 R\u00e9animation, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France; 4 R\u00e9animation Introduction Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is the leading cause for ICU admission in immunocompromised patients. In these patients, oxygenation strategy is of major interest to avoid the need for mechanical ventilation (MV), which is associated with high mortality rates. In that setting, use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and oxygen therapy with High Flow Nasal cannula (HFNC) could be interesting alone or in association, but data about initial ventilation strategy in immunocompromised patients are controversial.",

A recent study showed that patients treated with high-flow nasal cannulae oxygen therapy (HFNC) had lower intubation and mortality rates than those treated by the association of HFNC with NIV (1). High tidal volumes (VT) delivewred with NIV may be associated with an increased risk of intubation (2) . We aimed to identify risk factors associated to intubation, in hypoxemic patients with acute respiratory failure and especially the role of VT under NIV. Patients and methods This is an ancillary study from a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial including patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (FLORALI-study). We focused on only patients with moderate or severe hypoxemia (PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio \u2264200 mmHg) and we excluded those with mild hypoxemia. The criteria for intubation were predetermined including worsened or persisted respiratory failure, impairment of neurologic status and hemodynamic instability. Results After adjustment on the oxygenation strategy, the two factors independently associated with intubation were the presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates at admission (OR 2.

Thrombocytopenia, either defined by platelet count below 150 G/L or by a significant relative 20-40-percent decrease in platelet count is a potent poor prognostic factor in sepsis. Besides their role in hemostasis, platelets also carry various immune and inflammatory functions that are likely to impact on host defense against infections. We aimed to assess whether changes in the platelet count induced by sepsis is associated with the development of subsequent nosocomial infections. Patients and methods Patients were obtained from two prospective studies about immuno monitoring of dendritic cells and innate-like lymphocytes in critically ill septic patients (1, 2) . Adult patients with severe sepsis and septic shock were included. Exclusion criteria were any immunosuppressive condition (hematological malignancy, HIV infection at any stage, bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, daily corticosteroid therapy >0.5 mg/kg prednisone-equivalent, chemotherapy or any other immunosuppressive treatments), pregnancy, do-not-resuscitate orders on admission. In addition patients who died or who received platelet transfusion during the first week after ICU admission were also excluded. Platelet counts were collected on the day of sepsis diagnosis (D1) and then on D3, D5 and D7. The relative variation in platelet count at day n compared to day 1 was calculated as follows: (count at day n \u2212 count at day 1) \u00d7 100/ (count at day 1 between between D1 and D3, between D1 and D5 and between D1 and D7 were also similar between patients with and without ICUacquired infections (Fig. 12 ). Discussion In this preliminary study from selected cohorts of nonimmunocompromised patients, sepsis resulted in mild alterations in platelet counts, making it unlikely to become associated with the development of nosocomial infections. It would be relevant to address this question in larger cohorts of non-selected patients, as well as the impact of platelet transfusions in this setting.",

It has been shown that the RAI also occurs during cardiogenic shock (2) . Septic cardiomyopathy occurs in a significant proportion of septic shock patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of RAI on septic cardiomyopathy. Patients and methods Prospective observational study conducted in the intensive care in one university hospital in France. Patients meeting the criteria for septic shock without prior corticosteroid therapy and without chronic heart disease were included. Total blood cortisol levels were assessed immediately before (T0) a short corticotropin stimulation test (0.25 mg iv of tetracosactrin) and 30 and 60 min afterward. \u0394max was defined as the difference between the maximal value after the test and T0. RAI was defined as an inappropriate adrenal response with \u0394max < 9 \u00b5g/dl and septic cardiomyopathy as the appearance of cardiac systolic dysfunction (left ventricle ejection fraction <45%) within the first 3 days of septic shock. We performed a multivariable analysis using backward stepwise logistic regression to identify independent predictors of septic cardiomyopathy. Discussion Although the definition of RAI is not consensual, a threshold of \u0394max at 9 \u00b5g/dl has been widely used in septic shock, with or without the use of T0 (1). The usefulness of substitutive doses of steroids in septic shock is controversial, but many authors assume this treatment has a potential in reversing overt vasoplegia. Our data suggest an implication of RAI in septic cardiomyopathy. Conclusion We found RAI to be an independent predictor of septic cardiomyopathy. These findings may suggest a new role for substitutive doses of steroids in the hemodynamic management of septic shock.",

Introduction Guidelines about the moderate hypokalemia treatment (between 2.5 mmol/l and 2.9 mmol/l) are based on experts estimations, and non-specific ones for patients in the intensive care units (ICU). The aim of this study was to evaluate the correction of the hypokalemia in an ICU and the compliance of recommendations. Materials and methods An observational epidemiological, retrospective and monocentric trial has been realized during a period of 13 months (from January 2015 to February 2016). The study population included hospitalized patients in the ICU who have shown a first moderate hypokalemia episode, all cause considered. Patients who have presented an acute renal failure with a KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) score of three the day of their inclusion were excluded. The main primary study endpoint was percent correction of the serum potassium after 24 h. The secondary study endpoints were the incidence rate of moderate hypokalemia and the efficacy about the hypokalemia correction in accordance with the achieved treatment consistent or not with recommendations. Results 140 patients had at least one episode of hypokalemia. The incidence rate of the hypokalemia first episode was 1.8%. The study population included 106 patients. IGS2 score was 47.1 (\u00b1 16). 48 patients required mechanical ventilation at the inclusion. The serum potassium was greater than or equal to 3.5 mmol/l after 24 h about 34 patients (32.1%) (corrected group). At 24 h one patient had a serum potassium higher than 5 mmol/l. The average total potassium was respectively 72. infusion of potassium and 7 (6.6%) patients have been a management compatible with the most common recommendations (input potassium chloride of 100 mmol, use of the enteral administration and lack of continuous intravenous infusion). The percent correction of the hypokalemia after 24 h was respectively of 2/7 (28.6%) in the group in which recommendations had been respected and of 32/99 (32.3%) in the other one (p = 1.00). Discussion In our knowledge there are no previous studies that have specifically focused on the correction of the moderate hypokalemia in critically ill patients. In our study the incidence rate of the moderate hypokalemia was lower than data from the literature because we have only considered the first episode of the hypokalemia [1] . Among patients without contraindication to the enteral administration, this one was used in less than half of the cases. 62% of these patients received potassium with a continuous intravenous infusion and only 7 patients received medical care conform to the guidelines. The medium potassium quantity provided was very lower to the guidelines. Only 32% of the patients have been corrected after 24 h without any difference in the medium potassium quantity which has been provided in relation to the uncorrected group. Conclusion Only 32.1% of moderate hypokalemia in ICU are corrected after 24 h. The intravenous way is considerably used (in 72% of cases) with a poor return. A wide-ranging study is necessary to determine the best correction modes.",

Biological profile is pathognomonic with marked hemoconcentration and paradoxal hypoproteinemia. Hypovolemic shock is the classical feature of severe SCLS attacks.

(64%) mechanical ventilation, 6 (43%) renal replacement therapy, 5 (36%) veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 1 (9%) intra-aortic balloon pump and 1 (9%) an IMPELLA. Compartment syndrome occurred in 5 (45%) patients and 4 (36%) died in ICU. We then compared the 11 patients with myocardial involvement to the 28 without Clinical and biological manifestations were similar in between groups. However, chest pain (54 vs 11%, p = 0.008), dyspnea (82 vs 39%, p = 0.03) and respiratory failure (54 vs 18%, p = 0.044) were more frequent in patients with myocardial involvement than in others.

However, ECLS deplore a high mortality rate in the first days raising important ethic and economic consequences. In this context, continuation of support should be reassessed precociously. The aim of this study was the research of prognostic factors of 30-days mortality, 24 h after ECLS implantation for CS or CA. Materials and methods All patients undergoing ECLS in our tertiary center during a 2-year period were prospectively included. The ECLS were managed with a multidisciplinary protocol based on consensus. Clinico-biological data were collected just before and 24 h after ECLS implantation. These data were compared between survivors and deceased at 1 month. , CPC score was respectively 1 for 6 patients, 2 for 2, 4 for 1. At 12 months, CPC score changed only for the 2 patients with a CPC score at 2 (one died after another suicide attempt, one changed his CPC score to 3). In the group without CA (n = 88), 79 had normal neurological status at 6 months and 78 at 12 months (one patient died because of a cancer). Among these patients, 96% returned at home and 77% returned to work. 16 (18%) patients re-attempted suicide in the year. The major risk factor of mortality is the presence of a cardiac arrest on hanging site. All the other factors found to be related to mortality are well known risk factors in cardiac arrest of other origin. In univariate analysis, risk factors of neurological sequelae at 6 months were a cardiac arrest on hanging site (p = 0.045) an elevated diastolic blood pressure (87 vs 70 mmHg; p = 0.04), a lower initial Glasgow score (4 vs 5; p = 0.04), and an elevated blood glucose (1.39 vs 1.13 g/L p < 0.001) at admission in ICU. Discussion Our cohort of self-hanging patients can be divided in two parts: a) patients with CA in the pre-hospital period with a high mortality and a good neurological recovery in 2/3 surviving patient, but with a small group; b) patients without CA with a very low mortality and a very good neurological recovery. These results seem to be better than in the most important cohort [1] published until now in self-hanging patients without CA and not treated by HBOT (mortality at 9.5% and 3.5% of poor neurological recovery). Conclusion Patients surviving a self-attempted hanging who have not presented CA and treated by HBOT have mainly a good neurological outcome. Randomized control study should be undertaken to confirm HBOT effectiveness in that indication.",

A standardized clinical neurological evaluation including the RASS score, the GCS score, the Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) score and brainstem reflexes was coupled to an intermittent EEG. EEG was recorded as soon as possible within the first 72 h after VA-ECMO cannulation. EEG characteristics were analyzed by a neurophysiologist who was blinded to the patient's condition. A severely altered EEG pattern was defined as a predominant delta frequency, discontinuous, unreactive and/or an isoelectric background. The primary endpoint was poor neurological outcome, defined as the composite of death or acute brain injury on neuroimaging within 28 days. Data are presented as median (interquartile range) or number (percentage). False-positive rates (FPRs, corresponding to 1-specificity) of poor neurological outcome were calculated for each significant predictor, using an exact binomial 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Sixty-nine (age 58 (50-67) years) patients with a SOFA score of 14 (13-17) were included. Main indications for ECMO were: post cardiac surgery (n = 25, 36%), terminal dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 12, 17%), and acute myocardial infarction (n = 11, 16%). Cardiac arrest before ECMO cannulation was noted in 20 (29%) patients. EEG was recorded 1 (1-2) days after VA-ECMO cannulation and 62 (90%) patients were sedated at time of EEG. At day 28, 46 (67%) had a poor outcome (n = 37 deaths and n = 9 patients alive with acute brain injury). In univariate analysis, a lower RASS score (p = 0.003), a lower FOUR score (p = 0.001), a lower score on the motor component of the Glasgow coma scale (p = 0.001), and a lack of cough reflex (p = 0.033) at the time of EEG were significantly associated with a poor outcome. A severely impaired EEG pattern or presence of a discontinuous background activity were also associated with a poor outcome (p = 0.015 and p = 0.002, respectively). Indicators of poor neurologic outcome are presented in the Table 19 . Among all parameters, a discontinuous background activity was the only variable that constantly predicted poor outcome (false-positive poor outcome prediction rate of 0%, 95% CI 0-15%). Conclusion Early intermittent EEG has a strong prognostic value for sedated patients on VA-ECMO. Presence of a discontinuous EEG background activity seems to be more accurate than clinical alterations to predict a bad neurologic outcome at 28 days.",

EEG is the most widely used prognostic tool to support a clinical examination and is accessible in most hospitals. It is recommended for both prognostication and ruling out subclinical seizures. There is no high-level evidence for predicting poor prognosis using EEG because of the wide variety of classification systems used and the interrater variability.

All patients aged of more than 18 year-old admitted for a resuscitated cardiac arrest between November 2012 and July 2014 who underwent therapeutic hypothermia and a full multimodal prognostic evaluation including a EEG were included in the study. Outcome was classified according to the Cerebral Performance Category Score measured at day 28. Unfavorable outcome was defined as death (CPC 5), persistent vegetative state (CPC 4), or severe neurological disability (CPC 3). Favorable outcome was defined as moderate neurological disability (CPC 2), or no disability (CPC 1). EEG was performed in all patients still comatose after rewarming between 48 and 72 h after admission and after discontinuation of sedation. EEG interpretation was made by 2 independent senior neurophysiologists, blind to the outcome. EEG features are based on the latest ACNS classification. For each EEG feature, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) for predicting an unfavorable outcome were calculated. Results During the study period, 122 cardiac arrest were admitted of which 48 patients went through a full neurologic evaluation and were finally included in the study. According to neurological outcome, 19% had a favorable evolution, and 81% had an unfavorable outcome. The presence of burst suppression, and epileptiform activity was constantly associated with an unfavorable prognostic with a 100% specificity and 0% false positive. A non-reactive EEG is strongly associated with an unfavorable evolution with a 89% specificity and 3% false positive. Other features including periodic or rhythmic patterns and low voltage were inconstantly associated with unfavorable outcome. Kappa score for all EEG feature was slight or fair and always under 0.4. Discussion This study allowed us to identify a homogenous cohort of comatose patient after cardiac arrest who underwent therapeutic hypothermia. We identified simple EEG features based on the new classification of the ACNS constantly associated with unfavorable outcome. These features must be known by intensivists to better integrate EEG in the multimodal evaluation of neurological prognostic. There is important interrater variability that must lead to caution and to always use multimodal approach to prognostic an unfavorable outcome. Conclusion Bedside EEG is an excellent tool for predicting outcome of post-anoxic coma through simple EEG features. Burst suppression, epileptiform activity and non-reactive EEG are strongly associated to neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. However, the interrater variability emphasize the need of being well trained for the standardized methods of evaluating EEG parameters.",

We have studied the relative value of static filling volume and pressure to predict the fluid responsiveness, according to systolic cardiac function in children during acute circulatory failure. Patients and methods Patients under 8 years old with an acute circulatory failure of two intensive care units during a 1 year period of inclusion were analyzed. An exhaustive cardiac echography was performed initially (indexed End-diastolic volume (EDVi) and E/e' from transmitral and tissue Doppler were recorded), and the stroke volume index (SVI) was measured before and after a fluid challenge (a 10 ml/ kg of crystalloid over 10 min Results Twenty-five children with acute circulatory failure were included. Fluid responsiveness occurred in 6 of the 13 fluid loading events with low LVEF, and in 6 of the 12 fluid loading events with normal LVEF. Pressure approach: For low and normal LVEF, the AUC-ROC for fluid responsiveness was respectively 0.83 (CI 0.56-1)/0.73 (0.39-1) for a E/e' .The best thresholds of E/e' in low LVEF was 7.9 with a sensitivity of 87 (CI 62-100) % and a specificity of 67 (CI 33-100) %. For low and normal LVEF AUC ROC was respectively 0.6 (CI 0.21-0.99)/0.52 (CI 0.14-0.9) for the PVC. Volume approach: For low and normal LVEF, the AUC-ROC for fluid responsiveness was respectively 0.69 (CI 37-1) and 0.74 (0.4-1). The best thresholds in normal LVEF was an EDVi below 29 ml/m2 wit a Specificity of 83 (CI 50-100) and a sensitivity of 71 (CI 42-100) %. Discussion Our study shows a variation of the diagnostic value of E/e' and EDVi according to the left ventricular systolic function. Therefore, the systolic function should be taken into account to analysed the E/e' and EDVi value. Few preload dependency markers are validated in Children and none for children in spontaneous ventilation (2) . Our study suffers from a lack of power that calls into question the validity of our results. Another limitation is that both approaches with volume and pressure are not very discriminant as it is known for static value in adults. Our study illustrates that, on a pressure-volume curve, when the cardiac inotropism is reduced, the filling of the Left ventricle is moved to the up and right of the curvilinear diastolic function curve. Therefore, pressure variations are larger than volume variations. These values should be monitored on a larger scale to define their exact diagnostic value. Conclusion Static PVC value is a low preload-dependency surrogate. When LVEF is low a pressure evaluation based approach seems more accurate. When LVEF is normal a volume evaluation based approach seems informative as predicted by the slope of the end diastolic pressure volume curve. Those both static approaches remain of poor diagnosis accuracy.",

Fourteen infants (9 boys) with median age 33 days [firstthird quartiles 25-58] with severe bronchiolitis requiring CPAP were included after written informed consent. Children were investigated in PP and SP each applied for 1 h in a random order with a washout period of 10 min between them. Level of CPAP was set at 7 cmH 2 O in both conditions. Oesophageal pressure probe was inserted orally (CTO-2 pressure transducer, Gaeltec, Scotland) to measure oesophageal pressure. Flow and airway pressure (Pmo in Fig. 15 ) were simultanuously recorded using a Neurovent data acquisition system (Neurovent Inc, Toronto, Canada). One hundred breaths were analyzed in each condition, in which work of breathing was estimated from oesophageal pressure-time product (PTPes) and oesophageal swings (Fig. 15 ). Data were expressed as median (first-third quartiles) and compared by using the Wilcoxon two-sample paired sign test. A p-value below 0.05 was considered significant. . The eDTB contains data from ventilated patients (invasively and non-invasively) and details concerning ionotropic and sedative treatment during PICU courses. Discussion As far as we know, this eDTB is currently the only one as exhaustive available in PICU worldwide. After almost 3 years of multidisciplinary collaboration, we are able to collect many useful physiological, therapeutic and medical data in an ongoing eDTB. Although many concerns remain concerning data validation, organisation and exploitation, this eDTB already contribute to the development of clinical decision support systems and virtual patient validation and we create international collaborations to further develop these tools. Three research protocols using the database are ongoing including: validation of a neuromonitoring clinical decision support system, validation of a cardio-respiratory simulator, developement and validation of the automatic diagnosis of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and development of SpO2 forecast using artificial neuronal network. Conclusion Thanks to informatics and electronic devices improvement, data gathering in intensive care units has empowered. We hope that our work in PICU will encourage other teams on the way of data gathering, in order to build an international PICU eDTB in a close future.",

Children admitted in emergency room with severe trauma and moderate to severe TBI (Glasgow coma scale \u226412) from June 2014 to March 2016 were included. Pre-hospital and hospital data regarding primary care, equipment, medications and secondary cerebral insults control (i.e. blood pressure, oxygenation, CO 2 level, temperature, glycemia) were collected from medical files. Two pediatric transport team experts assessed the quality of pre-hospital care, based on two major endpoints. Results Twenty-nine files were analyzed. Median ISS was 34 . All the children had been referred directly from the trauma scene to the pediatric trauma center. They were all intubated in the prehospital setting, 4 (13.7%) presented with SpO2 < 90% before or at emergency room admission, and 17 (58.6%) presented with a pCO2 >45 mmHg at admission. At least one peripheral catheter was inserted in all the children. Mean total fluid bolus was 26.9 mL/kg (\u00b1 14). Nor-epinephrine was administered in 16 (55%) children. Mean blood pressure was below age threshold in 18 (62%) children during transport or at admission. An intracranial hypertension treatment (apart from sedation) was delivered in 17 (55%) children before admission. Body temperature was monitored in 10 patients and 17 were hypothermic at emergency room admission. Experts concluded on sub-optimal care in 17 children: major endpoint was \"respiratory care\", \"hemodynamic care\" and \"neurologic care\" in 13, 12 and 9 patients respectively. Discussion On this small series, we showed pre-hospital sub-optimal care regarding secondary cerebral insults control, especially regarding CO 2 level, blood pressure and body temperature. Our results will help to design new care improvement strategies (e.g. sedation, fluid bolus and ventilation optimization, early use of vasoactive drugs, systematic body temperature monitoring\u2026). Conclusion Data on pre-hospital secondary cerebral insults care are rare in the pediatric setting. Based on our results, we aim to improve quality of care of children presenting with traumatic brain injury, and to reduce its morbidity and mortality.",

The clinical, etiological, para clinical, and scalable were studied and transcribed on a standard electronic form.All patients had a brain CT. Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) was possible in 02 patients for lack of availability of the technical facilities during the study. Results Ten cases were selected. The mean age was 64 months (1 month to 15 years), 66% are male, 2 patients had a history of CHD like tetralogy of Fallot and complicated bronchiolitis myocarditis, one patient had a history of petechial purpura, 1 other was a factor 7 deficiency, headache history was noted in 02 patients, and 04 patients with no particular antecedent was found.

O1child arrived brain dead, 03 patients had generalized tonic-clonic seizures which yielded after taking a benzodiazepine (Diazepam) and phenobarbital (like gardenal). Cerebral CT was performed in all cases and could we revealed the nature of the stroke hemorrhagic in 07 cases and ischemic stroke in 03 cases. Two patients have benefited from an MRI that found a thrombosis of the artery internal carotid right Sylvian. Besides symptomatic treatment, treatment was initiated based on the type of stroke, 03 patients received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at 0.1 ml/kg in addition to symptomatic treatment, 02 patients received vitamin K. Four patients died in an array of autonomic disorders and evolved favorably and six patients were transferred to a pediatric unit. The average length of stay in ICU was 5.5 days (2-10 days). Discussion The mortality rate is important since no specialized center for children, and difficulty especially in the diagnostic imaging field while Suspected stroke should be confirmed by imaging and the diagnostic delay. Which is due to a poor assessment of the initial situation in half of the cases by the parents, the other half by the Swiss magazine consult\u00e9.une doctor showed that in a study in 42% of children with stroke, this diagnosis was not primarily discussed and that in 11% of cases the cause of the stroke was poorly evaluated [1] . Heart disease certainly represent the second most important risk factor. A collaboration of a team must be multidisciplinary, death has affected mostly older children whose age is between 11 and 15 years, who have a hemorrhagic stroke against by infants who have an ischemic stroke have evolved and oriented they exceed the acute phase to pediatric services for further investigation and monitoring. Conclusion The child may also be having a stroke, which usually reaches the elderly.

The main objective of this study was to compare the mortality and morbidity of children with severe intracranial hypertension after severe head trauma (TC) or due to vascular cause after decompressive craniectomy (DC) or medical therapy alone. The secondary objective was to identify the initial severity factors associated with higher mortality. Patients and methods A retrospective study was performed with data collected from patients aged under 18 years-old admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit for severe intracranial hypertension of traumatic or vascular cause, between January 2000 and January 2016. They were divided into 2 groups: patients who received medical therapy alone and those treated with decompressive craniectomy after optimal medical management. Results A total of 83 children were included. Among them, 17 were treated with DC (6 HTIC of vascular cause and 11 HTIC of traumatic cause), and 66 were supported by medical means only (6 HTIC of vascular cause and 60 HTIC of traumatic cause). In the population \"traumatic intracranial hypertension\", we note that children in the \"DC\" subgroup are more often in mydriasis upon arrival (p = 0.017) than in the subgroup treated medically. In this same population, children in the \"DC\" subgroup received higher doses of MIDA-ZOLAM (p = 0.015), of MANNITOL (p = 0.0041) and hypertonic saline (p = 0.0006) than in the other subgroup. In the population \"vascular intracranial hypertension\" the two subgroups were comparable. In the case of traumatic intracranial hypertension, mortality rate in the \"DC\" subgroup was 54.5% against 13.34% for children treated medically (p = 0.0015); \"DC\" children had more metabolic complications such as hypernatremia than \"not DC\" children, p = 0.043. Mortality rate in the \u00abvascular intracranial hypertension\u00bb group was 0% for children treated with decompressive craniectomy, and 83.3% for children treated medically alone (p = 0.015). Patients treated surgically in the \u00abvascular intracranial hypertension\u00bb group had longer overall stays (p = 0.009) and longer ICU stays (p = 0.016). POPC Score (Pediatric Overall Performance Category) upon discharge for children with intracranial hypertension of traumatic cause treated with decompressive craniectomy was 4.91 \u00b1 1.37 against 3.75 \u00b1 1.31 among children treated medically, p = 0.08. In \"DC\" children with intracranial hypertension of vascular cause, POPC upon hospital discharge was 3.66 \u00b1 0.51 against 5.66 \u00b1 0.81 among non-operated children, p = 0.007. The schooling rate was higher among children treated medically for intracranial hypertension of traumatic cause, p = 0.012. The severity factors related with higher mortality identified in the population \"traumatic intracranial hypertension\" were mydriasis upon admission, a PIM 2 score higher and a lower temperature (<35.5\u00b0); the latter being the only factor identified for HTIC of vascular cause. In the case of traumatic intracranial hypertension, ICP monitoring in survivors was 40.35% against 28.6% in children died, with no significant difference. In the population \"vascular intracranial hypertension\", all the patients who died had not been monitoring PIC. Discussion The severity factors related with higher mortality identified in the population \"traumatic intracranial hypertension\" were mydriasis upon admission, a PIM 2 score higher and a lower temperature (<35.5\u00b0); the latter being the only factor identified for HTIC of vascular cause. Other studies have related other severity factors as initial Glasgow scale, tardive decompressive craniectomy. Conclusion Decompressive craniectomy doesn't seem to improve the mortality rate or the outcome in patients with hypertension of traumatic cause in our study but the DC traumatic subgroup was more serious than the subgroup treated medically. In children with refractory intracranial hypertension of vascular cause DC significantly improves survival and outcome. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of decompressive craniectomy and its timing in the therapeutic management of refractory intracranial hypertension.",

There was no significant difference between 2 groups regarding aetiology of brain death nor administration of catecholamines. Having a cardiopulmonary arrest during intensive care unit stay was associated with a significant risk of presenting a MD (p = 0.034). Having a MD had no consequences on organ retrieval in general (p = 0.25), but was significantly associated with a decrease in heart retrieval opportunities (p = 0.036). The cause of heart grafts refusal was a poor ventricular function in 50% of cases (3 cases out of 6). The cause for non-retrieval was parental refusal in one-third of cases. Evolution of the cardiac grafts was favorable in 16 cases on 18, one transplanted patient died (from a non-cardiac cause) and 1 patient was lost to follow up. Conclusion MD in paediatric brain-dead patients has direct consequences on heart retrieval and transplantation, and otherwise, organ shortage is a major ongoing problem. A better transplant management regarding hemodynamics (with the use of a protocol) could increase the number of heart transplants, especially in small children, and reduce mortality rate in national waiting list.",

Its early use significantly reduces mortality (1). However, the studies do not strongly demonstrate its prognostic impact in pediatric ARDS. The aim of this study was to describe the prone positioning practices in the French-speaking pediatric intensive care units (PICU). Patients and methods This survey was conducted by email questionnaire to pediatric intensivists belonging to the French Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the French-speaking Group of Pediatric Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine. It was conducted From February to May 2016. The survey was addressed to doctors, nurses, physiotherapists practicing in PICU. It included 29 questions about indications, contraindications, techniques and medical devices used, and complications. Results One hundred and three persons answered (69 doctors and 33 nurses) which work in 28 french hospitals and 1 canadian hospital. Sixty-eight percent of interviewed persons have more than 5 years experience and 57% of them treat each year more than 10 children ARDS. Only 10% of the PICU have a PP medical protocol. Fifty percent of interviewed persons frequently use PP for the medical care of ARDS and 30% systematically use it. Thirty-six percent begin PP at the early phase of ARDS during conventional ventilation, while 42% before the introduction of unconventional ventilatory strategies (OHF); only 12% use it after the respiratory failure unless unconventional ventilatory strategies. Seventy-three percent report that PP is used with prolonged periods (>12 h/day), 22% with short periods (<12 h/day) and 14% with very long periods (>20 h/day). Regarding the weaning criteria, most of interviewed persons seem to use multiple and combinated criteria: 51% use hypoxemia severity parameters (PaO 2 /FiO 2 , PaO 2 , SaO 2 ), 39% use the oxygen level (FiO 2 ) and 38% use the mechanical ventilation parameters (PEEP, P max, P plate). Finally, despite a low level of scientific evidence in children, 87% of the persons gave a strong recommendation for PP as standard care in severe pediatric ARDS. See Fig. 16 .",

The timing of the PP beginning can be different according to children, early and prior to use of the conventional ventilation strategy in most cases. The duration of PP seems more consensual. Most of the centers use extended periods longer than 12 h/day. These results are close to Gu\u00e9rin et al. advocating a duration >16 h/day. Finally, the weaning is a great issue and depends on multiple criteria. In Guerin et al.

No study has validated PP weaning criteria during pediatric ARDS. Conclusion The prone positioning is a strategy commonly used in pediatric intensive care units for the severe pediatric ARDS. The criterias of implementation and timing are variable, as well as the weaning criterias. More pediatric multicenter randomized studies will be necessary to confirm the benefits of PP in pediatric ARDS and to define clear weaning criteria.",

            "text": "Introduction Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) recipients have profound defects in every immunity compartments that can lead to severe opportunistic infections (OI). 20% of HSCT patients require admission to the ICU because of diverse infectious or non-infectious complications with dismal outcomes. OI specific course in this population has not been described previously and the management of these infections may be a concern. The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors, management and outcomes of IO in HSCT recipients admitted to the ICU. Patients and methods This was a retrospective (2007-2016) single center study of patients admitted to ICU after an allogeneic HSCT. Patients provided written informed consent according to Helsinki declaration. Data regarding the transplant, infections and life sustaining therapy use were analyzed. OI were considered if present at the time or during ICU admission. Results Hundred and ninety-four patients (Pt) were included. Median age was 43 [28; 58] years, 63.2% were males. Reason for transplantation was acute leukemia in 84 (42%) Pt and the hematological condition was still in complete remission at ICU admission in 83% of patients. 78 (41%) and 53 (28%) had received a myeloablative conditioning regimen and anti-thymoglobulin serum respectively. 40% had acute graft versus host disease over grade 2 at ICU admission. OI was documented in 38 patients (20%). An invasive fungal infection (IFI) was found in 19 Pt owing to 3 mucormucosis, 1 trichosporon septicemia and 15 invasive aspergillosis (5 possible, 9 probable and 1 proven according to EORTC criteria). Serum Galactomannane antigen was positive in 10 (67%). Median time from transplantation and ICU admission to IFI diagnosis was respectively 86 [18; 529] and \u22123 [\u22128; 0] days. Lung was involved in 90% and patients with aspergillosis were admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure in 71% (vs. 33% for others p = 0.2). They did not required invasive ventilation more frequently (36 vs. 31% p = 0.8). 32 and 10% required vasopressors and renal replacement therapy with no difference as compared to others. Median ICU length was 3 [2; 6] days. Demographic, stem cell source, and donor type were not associated with IFI occurrence in this population. However 15/19 had received a total body irradiation (78 vs. 47% p = 0.01). IFI occurrence was not associated with ICU or Day 90 mortality (33 vs. 26% p = 0.7 and 53 vs. 41% p = 0.3 respectively). A viral infection was found in 17 Pt owing to 11 CMV, 1 adenovirus, 1 HSV and 1 VRS infections. Analyses were focused on CMV reactivation. Median time from transplantation and ICU admission to CMV reactivation was respectively 111 [50; 151] and \u221223 [\u221238; \u221210] days. Reactivation was mainly positive blood PCR but 1 pt had CMV colitis. A preemptive treatment was started on the same day in median and lasts 34 [21; 71] days. Patients with CMV reactivation had more frequently multiple organ failure (50 vs. 22% p = 0.06) and higher ICU admission SOFA score (7 [5; 12] vs. 6 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] p = 0.05). They trend to have higher admission creatinine serum level (132 [72; 157] vs. 81 [60; 120] umol/L, p = 0.2) and more frequently required emergency renal replacement therapy (36 vs. 7% p = 0.01) mechanical ventilation (64 vs. 30% p = 0.04) and vasopressors (73 vs. 37% p = 0.02). Median ICU length was 4 [2; 11] days and comparable to others. Demographic, stem cell source, conditioning regimen and donor type were not associated with CMV occurrence. CMV reactivation was not significantly associated with ICU or Day 90 mortality (36 vs. 26% p = 0.5 and 60 vs. 41% p = 0.3 respectively). Conclusion OI was found in 20% of allogeneic HSCT recipients admitted to the ICU. IFI were mainly responsible for respiratory distress and CMV associated to multiple organ failure. Non-invasive diagnostic tests were positives in a majority of these patients. In this cohort, IO treatment was started quickly after the diagnostic and we did not find an association with mortality. Intensivists should always consider OI in their diagnostic panel in this specific population.",

            "text": "Introduction Over the last two decades, targeted therapies in patients with solid tumors have both increased their length of survival and significantly altered their immune functions. However, data on opportunistic infections in this setting remain scarce. In this systematic review, we sought to identify published cases of opportunistic infections in patients with solid tumors, with a special interest on clinical findings, trends over time and outcomes. Materials and methods We performed a search of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) on PubMed using the words pneumonia pneumocystis (PCP), invasive aspergillosis (IA), histoplasma, mucor, geotrichum, cryptococcus, coccidioidomycosis combined with the MeSH term neoplasms (breast, lung, ovarian, urologic gastrointestinal, digestive system, abdominal, brain, carcinoid tumor, sarcoma, testicular, seminoma). We identify published cases of opportunistic infections in non HIV patients with solid tumors between 01/01/1966 and 05/01/2016 included. Results Regarding Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, 94 cases could be identified. There were 32 men and 62 women, aged of 57.5 (19-80) years. Underlying tumors were chiefly brain neoplasms (n = 31, 33%), lung neoplasms (n = 24, 26%) and breast neoplasms (n = 16, 17%). At the time of Pneumocystis pneumonia onset, 52 patients (55%) had a history of chemotherapy, 58 (62%) had received long term or high dose steroids, and 21 (22%) had an history of biotherapy targeting the malignancy. Of note, 18 patients (19%) had received only chemotherapy, 17 (18%) had received steroids alone, 4 (4%) everolimus therapy alone and 3 (3%) received none of these treatments. Regarding invasive aspergillosis 64 cases could be identified. Mean age was 66.7 (37-82) and 46 (72%) were men. Solid tumors associated with invasive aspergillosis were primarily lung neoplasms (n = 31, 48%) and brain neoplasms (n = 24, 38%). At aspergillosis onset, 38 (59%) patients had a history of chemotherapy, 29 (45%) were receiving long term or high dose steroids and 3 (5%) had received targeted therapy. Fourteen (22%) patients had received only chemotherapy, 2 (3%) only steroids, and 1 (1.5%) had received targeted therapy alone. For both infection, there was a trend for a higher number of reported cases throughout the studied period. Conclusion This systematic review provides objective data showing that an increased proportion of patients with solid tumors present with opportunistic infections. We are convinced that it is a clinically relevant but still neglected problem. Selected oncologic population may be becoming eligible for antimicrobial prophylaxis against Pneumocystis or Aspergillus.",

Patients were included only if they are non-immunocompromised according to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). Invasive aspergillosis was defined as an association of microbiological evidence, a radiological imaging and a clinical context. Results Eighteen patients (13 males) were identified during the study period. The median of IGS II was 60.5 (interquartile range (IRQ), 49.25-78.75). Ninety-four percent was under mechanical ventilation. Fourteen (78%) patients were suffering from liver failure. Among liver failure, twelve (86%) were beforehand suffering from cirrhosis. The median MELD score was 42 (interquartile range (IRQ), 30-53). Sixty-four percent of aspergillosis were due to Aspergillosis fumigatus. Hundred percent were pulmonary aspergillosis. Fifty-six percent of aspergillosis were associated with bacterial pneumonia. The mortality rate at the date of the latest news (an average of 2 years) was seventytwo percent. Discussion Invasive aspergillosis is not exceptional in the non-immunocompromised patient especially in patient developing liver failure. An active research of colonization/infection with aspergillus in these patients remain to be discussed. Conclusion Invasive aspergillosis in ICU has a poor prognosis. The liver failure seems to be the most important risk factor in non-immunocompromised patients according EORCT criteria.",

This makes respiratory system elastance (Ers) not reflecting lung elastance (El). Little is known about the changes of Ecw, El and lung resistance (Rl) when moving the patient from the SP to the PP via the lateral position (LP). The goal of present study was to measure Ecw, El and Rl in ARDS patients in SP, LP and PP during the proning procedure. Patients and methods It was a prospective, single-center, controlled study. ARDS patients intubated, sedated and paralyzed with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio < 150 mmHg, PEEP \u2265 5 cmH 2 0 and an indication of PP were included. Mechanical ventilation was delivered in volume controlled mode with constant flow inflation and end-inspiratory pause 0.100 s included into the inspiratory time. Ventilator settings were unaltered during the procedure. An esophageal balloon catheter (Nutrivent device) was used for esophageal pressure (Pes) measurement. Pressure at the airway opening (Pao) and airflow were measured by Fleish 2 pneumotachograph proximal to endotracheal tube and upstream Heat and Moisture exchanger. Pao, Pes and airflow were continuously measured during 30 min in SP, then during 1 min in LP and 30 min in PP. The side for the lateralization was that selected by routine practice (in the opposite side from central venous line). Ers and resistance of the respiratory system (Rrs) were obtained by fitting flow and Pao signals breath by breath to the first order equation. Ecw and resistance of the chest wall (Rcw) were similarly obtained by fitting flow and Pes signals breath by breath to the first order equation pertaining to the chest wall. El and lung resistance (Rl) were obtained by subtracting Ers and Rrs from Ecw and Rcw, respectively. Our ethical committee approved the protocol. Data are shown as median (first and third quartiles). Comparisons between positions were made by using paired-t-test. Results Twenty-nine patients, 19 males, of 68 (62-74) years, SAPS 2 45 (34-55) and SOFA score 7 (3-9) were included 1 (0-2) days after ARDS criteria were met. The ARDS severity was moderate in 25 cases (86%) and severe in 4 (14%). Tidal volume averaged 5.9 (5.6-6) ml/kg predicted body weight, PEEP 10 (10-10) cmH 2 O, FiO 2 60 (50-70) %, PaO 2 /FiO 2 122 (108-139) mmHg. The cause of ARDS was pulmonary in 21 cases (72%), extra pulmonary in 3 (10%) and undetermined in 6 (18%). Lateral positioning was on the right side in 14 (48.3%) and on the left side in 15 patients (51.7%). The results are shown in the Table 21 . Conclusion During prone positioning in ARDS patients, as compared to SP we observed a higher RL in LP and an increased Ecw in PP.",

Patients and methods Prospective randomized control study in moderate to severe ARDS patients within the first 48 h of the onset of ARDS. All patients were monitored by an esophageal catheter and followed during 48 h. Moderate ARDS patients were randomized in two groups according to the systematic administration of a 48 h continuous infusion of cisatracurium besylate or not (control group). The severe ARDS patients group received a 48 h continuous infusion of cisatracurium besylate. The evolution during the 48 h of the study of the oxygenation and the respiratory mechanics including inspiratory and expiratory transpulmonary pressures and driving pressure were assessed and compared. Delta transpulmonary pressure (\u2206PL) was defined as inspiratory PL minus expiratory PL. Results Thirty patients were included, 24 in the moderate ARDS group and 6 in the severe ARDS group. NMBA infusion was associated with an improvement in oxygenation both the moderate and the severe ARDS patients group accompanied by a decrease in both the plateau pressure and the total positive end expiratory pressure. The mean inspiratory and expiratory PL were higher in the moderate ARDS patients group receiving NMBA as compared with the control group (Fig. 17) . In contrast, there was no modification of both the driving pressure and the \u2206PL related to NMBA administration. Conclusion NMBA could exert beneficial effects in moderate ARDS patients through higher observed inspiratory and expiratory transpulmonary pressures.",

The use of PP in patients with severe ARDS associated with brain injury is at high risk of intracranial hypertension. The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of PP on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in patients with ARDS and acute neurological condition requiring monitoring of ICP. Patients and methods It is a retrospective descriptive study including sixteen patients with acute brain injury (subarachnoid hemorrhage, severe head trauma, and hemorrhagic stroke) and continuous monitoring of ICP who developed a severe ARDS during ICU stay from January 2012 to December 2015 and for which PP was performed. 29 PP sessions were analyzed. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, blood oxygenation, PIC and PPC were studied in supine, before PP and after PP. The study was approved by FICS ethic comity. Results A significant increase in PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was observed in PP, from 112 \u00b1 34 to 200 \u00b1 84 (p < 0.01). In PP, the ICP was increased 11 \u00b1 1.1-17 \u00b1 1.3 mmHg (p < 0.05) while the CPP was stable 74 \u00b1 2 versus 76 \u00b1 2 mmHg (NS). Median duration of PP session was 16 h (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Increasing of ICP during PP required medical treatment in 8 sessions (27%). PP session was interrupted in 6 sessions (20%). In subgroup of patients who respond to PP in terms of oxygenation, the increase of ICP was lower than in non-responders (43 vs 118%) (p < 0.05). CPP was not modified whatever the nature of the response to PP (76 \u00b1 15-77 \u00b1 11 in non-responders and from 73 \u00b1 10 to 76 \u00b1 10 in responders (NS)) (Fig. 18 ). Discussion Our study shows an improvement of oxygenation during PP in severe ARDS patient with acute brain injury. We observe a constant increment of PIC during PP sessions. The increment of ICP is less in responders to PP. Significant increased ICP requiring an enhancement in the medical treatment was observed in 30% of the cases, and lead in most cases to a discontinuation of the session. Our data underlined the absolute necessity to monitor ICP during PP session in patients with acute brain injury and ARDS, even if ICP is controlled previously in supine. Only 3 prospective (1, 2) and one retrospective studies evaluate the effects of PP on ICP in patients with acute brain injury and acute respiratory failure (ARF). They results are similar to ours. In all these studies, the severity of ARF was often not well specified. Roth and al.",

Approximately 8 kg of waste is produced per patient per day with 45% of infectious waste and 55% of general waste. These results were linked with a bad distribution of garbage bags in the rooms (130 L of infectious waste versus 50 L of general waste). Secondly, we have improved our way to sort and consume and we have created recycling dies without compromising patient safety. All these measures have not increased workload. Changing bags in the rooms (20 L of infectious waste and 2 bags of 50 L of general waste) allowed to reach the normal goals of 2 sectors with a net benefit estimated at 4500 euros per year. The medical broken glass containing drugs was thrown into plastic containers of 5 L for infectious waste to prevent the risk of cuts. By creating a specific die intended to the general waste, we could quantify the production of this glass to 10 kg per week and to spare the use and the incineration of 350 containers of 5 L per year (global economy of 1000 euros). Plastic packaging represented an important proportion of the cremated waste. We have created 3 sectors of recycling including the polypropylene (80-200 kg per month), the polyethylene colorless and colored polyethylene. This plastic is sold to be recycled without additional cost for the hospital. The linerboards was cremated. We have created a recycling die (50 kg per month). This sector was subsequently extended to the entire hospital structure, particularly the pharmacy that produces 12 containers of 400 L per month. They are now sold without additional cost. Many unnecessary plastic waste is generated daily. We have removed using mild soap plastic bottles of 30 ml by using the same mild soap in pump of 500 ml (economy of 1000 euros). The use of 100 L plastic bags for the transitional deposit of linen has been deleted (economy of 450 euros). Concerning the paper: 100% of the impressions were made in simplex. Printers were parametrized on both sides by default allowing the economy of 60 reams per year (30,000 sheets), several thousand liters of water and the reduction of CO 2 emissions. Discussion Recycling is only one component of the sustainable development in health. Other avenues that could be considered to improve ICU sustainability would include examining water use (for linen), electricity use (reducing non-essential use at night\u2026). Beyond these actions, we need to encourage our suppliers to turn to sustainable and recyclable packages to reduce the use of polluting and depletable fossil fuels such as oil. But also to develop with them circular economies where waste is returned to them to be reused. Conclusion We must ask the question also resuscitate our tons of waste. Our ICU produce large quantities of waste (over 2 tons per year per bed). However, a significant proportion, especially plastic, is recyclable with a significant environmental and financial benefit. Waste management also requires an optimal and rational use of supplies because \"the best waste is that which is not produced\" and that excess is not a guarantee of quality.",

Semi quantitative evaluation of mtDAMP content was tested by qPCR, with specific markers of mtDNA (cytochrome B (cytb), NADPH oxidase (ND4)). Intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg of mtDAMPs was used as experimental model in wild type and RAGE KO mice, as previously described [1] . The mtDAMPs were also administrated after ex vivo DNAse preparation. Endothelial function was assessed with a Mulvany-Halpern style myograph, 4 h after mtDAMP administrations on aorta (conductive vessel) and on 2d division of mesenteric artery (resistive vessel). Endothelial-dependent relaxation was studied by cumulative expositions of the vessels to acetylcholine (1.10-10-1.10-5 M). Endothelial-independent relaxation was studied by sodium nitroprussiate exposition. Results The mtDAMPs preparation contains a high quantity of mtDNA with a 1/cycle threshold (Ct) ratio of 0.062 for cytb expression. Intraperitoneal administrations of mtDAMPs induced a decrease of endothelial-dependent relaxation mainly on conductive vessel (p = 0.0079, n = 5 per group) and to a lesser extent on resistive vessel (p = 0.22, n = 5 per group). RAGE-KO mice were protected from mtDAMPs-induced aorta dysfunction (p = 0.53, n = 5 per group). The ex vivo exposition of mtDAMPs to a DNAse preparation decreased mtDNA content in mtDAMPs solution with a 1/Ct ratio of 0.038 for cytb expression. Eventually, the pretreatment of mtDAMPs with a DNAse preparation prevented the mtDAMPs-induced aorta dysfunction (p = 0.85, n = 5). Discussion More than prognostic markers, mtDAMPs particularly mtDNA seems implicated in endothelial dysfunction in critically ill patient. New evidence suggest RAGE interaction in endosomal TLR9 pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant response to mtDNA [2] . Also in sepsis, physiological clearance of circulating DNA might be impaired, this results comfort the possibility of therapeutic regulation of free circulating mtDNA to prevent septic organ dysfunction related to mtDAMPs accumulations. Conclusion Exogenous mtDAMPs can induce endothelial dysfunction in mice. The mtDNA-RAGE axis is a key component of the signaling pathway involved in this dysfunction.",

However, these parameters have several limits. Venous to arterial carbon dioxide difference inversely related to cardiac index. Consequently, fluid administration would be beneficial if carbon dioxide gap increases. Objective To investigate whether carbon dioxide gap predicts fluid responsiveness in patients with acute circulatory failure. Patients and methods We conducted a prospective study in the medical intensive care unit of Hospital Taher Sfar at Mahdia, between March 2013 and April 2016. Patients with circulatory failure and who required mechanical ventilation were included. We measured the variation of cardiac index between baseline and after volume expansion of 500 ml of saline fluid. The PiCCO2 was used to measure cardiac index. Response to fluid challenge was defined as a 15% increase in cardiac index. Before and after fluid administration, we recorded carbon dioxide difference and hemodynamic parameters. Results Among 68 included patients, 33 (49%) were responders. The causes of acute circulatory failure were septic shock (n = 45), cardiogenic shock (n = 11), and Hypovolemia (n = 12). Carbone dioxide gap was significantly higher in responders group (8 \u00b1 7 vs 4 \u00b1 4 mmHg, p = 0.019). The area under the ROC curve for carbon dioxide gap was 0. 68 (95% CI 0.55-0.80). The best cutoff value was 6 mmHg (Sensibility = 46%, specificity = 80%, positive predictive value = 52% and negative predictive value = 60%). The area under the ROC curve for delta carbon dioxide was 0.54 (95% CI 0.4-0.68).

Sepsis-associated myocardial dysfunction promote the occurrence of SVA by constituting an arrythmogenic substrate or under the effect of inotropic drugs. The aim of this study is to assess the incidence and prognostic impact of SVA in patients with septic shock. Patients and methods We retrospectively studied all patients with new onset SVA suffering from septic shock in non cardiac surgical ICU. Myocardial dysfunction was evaluated by transthoracic echography (TTE) after an adequate cardiac resuscitation using intravenous fluids expansion and adjunctive vasoactive agents. SVA was detected by the electrocardiogram scope. During the study period clinical and biologic characteristics, hemodynamic tolerance (vasopressors doses, arterial pressure changes), current treatment (such as corticoid), duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of vasopressor requirement and hospital mortality were collected. Results Sixty patients were included in the study. The SVA occurred in 28 patients, with an incidence of 46%. The median time to onset was 2 days. Cardioversion was performed for 15 patients with an effectiveness of 80%. Clinical and biological characteristics were similar between the groups with and without SVA: SAPS 2 and SOFA score at the beginning of septic shock, the existence of ARDS and cardiac biomarkers (NT-proBNP, troponin). However, renal failure and the use of corticoid in septic shock were more frequent in the group with SVA. The maximum doses of vasopressor agent were not significantly different between the groups with or without SVA. Myocardial dysfunction in sepsis defined by the left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 45% (or the need for inotropic drug for LVEF > 45%) was not associated with the occurrence of SVA (+SVA group: n = 8; \u2212SVA group: n = 6; p: 0.57). SVA was poorly-tolerated, observed by a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure and a significant increase in norepinephrine doses within 1 h of the start of SVA. The occurrence of SVA was associated with longer duration of use of vasopressor agent and a longer duration stay in ICU (+SVA group: 21 days, \u2212SVA group: 14 days; p = 0.03). There was no difference in duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital mortality between the two groups. Conclusion The occurrence of SVA is common in septic shock, poorly tolerated hemodynamically and associated with longer duration stay in the ICU and vasopressor need. Sepsis myocardial dysfunction isn't necessarily associated to the occurrence of SVA.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the long term hemodynamic response to prone position in a larger series of ARDS patients. Patients and methods Single center retrospective observational study performed on ARDS patients hospitalized in a medical ICU between July 2012 and March 2016. Patients included were adults fulfilling the Berlin definition for ARDS, undergoing at least one prone position session, under hemodynamic monitoring by the Picco \u00ae device, with availability of hemodynamic measurements performed before (T1), at the end (T2), and after the prone position session (T3). Prone position sessions were excluded if they were performed >7 days after ARDS onset. The following variables were recorded: demographic, SAPSII, ARDS severity and risk factor, SOFA score and cumulative fluid balance at PP onset, delay between ARDS session and PP session, hemodynamic, arterial blood gas, ventilatory settings, plateau pressure, catecholamine dose and additional treatments. Statistical analyses were performed using prone position session as statistical unit and mixed models taking into account both multiple prone position sessions by patient and multiple measurements during a prone position session. p < 0.05 was chosen for statistical significance. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Results 85 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria over the study period, totalizing 149 prone position sessions (2 \u00b1 1 sessions per patient). Patients' age was 65 \u00b1 11 y, 67% were male, 75% fulfilled the criteria for severe ARDS, and SAPSII at ICU admission was 64 \u00b1 17. ARDS risk factors were pneumonia in 63 (74%), aspiration pneumonia in 26 (31%), and sepsis in 7 (8%) patients. Duration of prone position sessions was 16 \u00b1 3 h. Hemodynamic measurements were performed in PP 13 \u00b1 3 h after PP session onset. At session onset, SOFA score was 15 \u00b1 4, and cumulated fluid balance was 2.5 \u00b1 7.1 L. Vasopressor were used in 87%, inhaled nitric oxide in 22%, and neuromuscular blocking agents in 91% of the sessions. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters before, during and after the prone position sessions are reported in Table 24 . Cardiac index increased by at least 15%, decreased by at least 15% or remained stable in 35 (24%), 36 (34%), and 78 (52%) of the sessions, respectively. As compared to both other groups, PP sessions with significant increase in cardiac index had the following significant differences at T1 by univariate analysis: lower cardiac index, lower global end-diastolic volume, lower cardiac function index, and lower vasopressor dose. Multivariate analysis is under investigation. Conclusion Prone position is associated with an increase in global end-diastolic volume, reversible after return in supine position that may explain the positive effect of PP on cardiac index observed in \u00bc of the PP sessions. Introduction Make sure that our patient have a good circulatory condition is a daily challenge for the intensivist. One of the therapeutics is fluid and one of his purpose is to increase venous return and then cardiac output. In order to examine that, There are several tools as the transthoracic echocardiogram wich allows the visualisation and the study of the respiratory variability from the inferior vena cava (IVC). Unfortunately there are some situations where the IVC visualisation is difficult (obesity, gut surgery, emphysema). The IVC is easily seen by a transhepatic ultrasound in her retrohepatic section. We make the hypothesis that the shape of the IVC could be predictive of fluid responsiveness.",

We performed a echocardiogram and we take two measures of the ICV: major axis and minor axis, the ICV is measured avec the sus hepatic vena. A elastometry index (EI) is determined which is the ratio of minor axis to minor axis. The fluid challenge is 250 ml of isotonic saline then we perform a new echocardiogram. A Tag is written on the patient to take the same ultrasound slice. We retain one increase of 15% of the cardiac index (IC) as a success of the filling. We exclude the presenting patients A right cardiac insufficiency, an arrhythmia and/or a HTAP. The statistical analysis is realized with the software R. Results Between August, 2015 and January, 2016 we included 49 patients. The average age is of 59 years (24-81), IGS2 of 48 (20-84), Ejectionnal Fraction of 48% 35-75) and the S wave tricuspid is 14 (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . The causes of the filling were an oliguria (31%), a low blood pressure (20%), a low cardiac output (30%), a hyperlactat\u00e9mia (9%) and an other cause in 10% of the cases. We find a positive correlation between the EI and the increase of the IC, also for the area of the VCI and the respiratory variations of the VCI (p0.05) the other variables are not predictive (BP, E/e' , E/A). The data are summarized in the picture 1. ROC curves has been established ( Only 16% of the journals studied required authors to use STARD. A high Impact factor and the year of the study were the items associated with a better SQS the presence of a conflict of interest was associated with a lower SQS in univariate analysis. A higher impact factor (> 5), was the only independent factors statistically significantly (p = 0.037) associated with higher SQS in a multivariate regression model. Discussion Our study showed that the SQS were very low. Assessment of a study depends on quality of reporting. Blindness and participant sampling are the cornerstone to evaluate such bias as spectrum, verification, review and selection bias of a study, and were unfortunately scarcely reported compared to existing data in diagnosis accuracy reporting. One of the limitation is the 5 years sample of the study. We have planned to continue the analysis for a 10-year review starting just after the 2003 STARD publication. Conclusion Our study showed that several items remain poorly reported. We recommend systematic use of STARD criteria in the elaboration and reporting of future studies that evaluates the preload dependence.",

Often ascribed to high plasmatic levels of ammonia, encephalopathy could also be induced by drugs or infection, due to altered blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. This latter setting is often underdiagnosed and encephalopathy related to hyperammonemia (so called hepatic encephalopathy-HE) being pointed out as the culpit of all neurological symptoms in cirrhotic patients. Quinolones and betalactamins were recently found in the cerebrospinal fluid of HE patients and it has been shown that the expression of efflux pumps, responsible for drugs passing through the BBB, was altered in animal models of HE. The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of neurological impairment, i.e. encephalopathy, in cirrhotic patients hospitalized in Discussion Overall, we reported a higher rate of lumbar puncture than those reporting in others studies concerning status epilepticus. Furthermore the rate of 16% of pleocytosis directly linked to status epilepticus is slightly higher than in most studies. Unfortunately we didn't realize a second lumbar puncture to assess the pleocytosis normalization during the days following the first lumbar puncture. The pathophysiological hypothesis of this phenomenon may be that prolonged/repeated seizures during status epilepticus would induce a blood-brain barrier dysfunction thereby favoring a cerebrospinal pleocytosis. Conclusion In our study, 16% of status epilepticus without infectious or neoplastic origin had a cerebrospinal pleocytosis directly linked to status epilepticus. This pleocytosis was significantly associated with myoclonic seizures and blood leukocytosis. These data may help to interpretation of cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis during status epilepticus.",

            "text": "Introduction Protected specimen brush (PSB) is considered to be one of the standard methods for the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). To our knowledge, there is no study assessing effect of prior antibiotherapy on direct examination, bacteriological culture and concordance of direct microscopy and culture. Patients and methods All consecutive episodes of suspected VAP were retrospectively evaluated between January 2014 and December 2014 in a 20-bed intensive care unit. Patient's characteristics and preexisting conditions were abstracted from the medical charts. After assessment of VAP probability using the clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS), PSB were performed in patients with a CPIS of 6 or more. Based on antibiotic treatment in patients when bacteriological specimens were obtained, two groups were defined: no antibiotic group and antibiotic treatment started before PSB group. Two independent bacteriologists retrospectively reviewed direct examination and culture of PSB to assess bacteriological concordance, defined as non-concordant when direct examination and culture were different, concordant when direct examination and culture were similar and partially concordant when either direct examination or culture were comparable but with other microorganisms lacking in one or the other method. Results During this 12-months period, among 73 mechanically ventilated patients, 116 episodes of suspected VAP with PSB were evaluated. We found 60% of PSB (n = 70) performed without antibiotic treatment and 40% of PSB (n = 46) performed under antibiotherapy. We found no significant differences in patient's demographics, characteristics, and severity between both groups. Patients received antibiotics for the following reasons: aspiration pneumonia (n = 12), peritonitis (n = 8), VAP (n = 7), community-acquired pneumonia (n = 4), septic shock of unknown origin (n = 4), pyelonephritis (n = 3), meningitis (n = 2), acute pancreatitis (n = 2) and others (n = 4). The median duration of mechanical ventilation in the antibiotic receiving group and in the group without antibiotics was 7.5 days (IQR; 5-12 days) and 9 days (IQR: 5-22), respectively. When PSB was performed under antibiotic treatment, direct examination was positive in 26% (n = 12), culture was positive in 28% (n = 13) and those methods were concordant, non concordant and partially concordant in 93% (n = 43), 4% (n = 2) and 3% (n = 1), respectively. On the other hand, when PSB was performed without antibiotics, direct examination was positive in 65% (n = 46), culture was positive in 62% (n = 43) and those methods were concordant, non concordant and partially concordant in 71% (n = 50), 18% (n = 12) and 11% (n = 8), respectively. In univariate analysis, we found a significantly higher proportion of negative direct examination and negative culture in the antibiotic group (p > 0.001). Moreover, these methods were significantly more frequently concordant (p = 0.01), with a higher rate of both negative microscopic exam and culture when compared to the no antibiotic group (76%, n = 33 vs 38%, n = 18). Surprisingly, among the 13 patients previously treated with antibiotics with positive culture, 38% (n = 5) of the microorganisms showed antibiotics sensitivity. Discussion Whether prior antibiotic treatment may induce false negative of false positive treatment is a well-recognized phenomenon, the precise effect of antibiotics on direct examination and quantitative culture is not well assessed in VAP. Moreover, despite recent development of clinico-radiological score, diagnosis of VAP remains difficult, with no gold-standard. Therefore, bacteriological guided therapy is of particular importance. We found PSB realization under antibiotic treatment is associated with a lower rate of positive direct examination and culture and suggest performing these bacteriological samples without antibiotherapy. Some authors have suggested lowering the diagnostic threshold point of this bacteriological technique in order to preserve its accuracy. However, we can postulate that microorganisms responsible of superinfection in mechanically ventilated patients treated with antibiotics may be resistant and therefore the PSB could be positive. Conclusion In patients with a high pre-test probability of ventilatoracquired pneumonia, recent introduction of antibiotics significantly reduced the diagnostic accuracy of protected brush specimen by reducing rates of positive direct examination and culture. Further studies should evaluate if antibiotic discontinuation may revert this effect. Ann. Intensive Care 2017, 7(Suppl 1):7",

The incidence density decreased from 33.74 to 18.05 VAP per 1000 ventilator days between observational and interventional period, but the all-cause mortality was almost equal in the 2 groups (88.6 vs. 86%).

            "text": "Introduction With an increasing incidence and high mortality rates, sepsis is a public health issue. There is growing evidence that sepsis induces long lasting alterations of transcriptional programs through epigenetic mechanisms that may lead to protracted inflammation, organ failure, sepsis-induced immune suppression (SIIS), secondary infections and death. We hypothesized that epigenetic changes contribute to the pathophysiology of SIIS. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibition with trichostatin A (TSA) in a double-hit murine model of SIIS and secondary pneumonia. Materials and methods C57BL/6 mice were treated with TSA (2 mg/ kg ip) or saline serum (CTL) 30 min before induction of sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Surviving mice underwent intratracheal instillation of 1.5 \u00d7 10 6 CFU of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8 days after CLP. We evaluated the effect of TSA on survival and cellular responses to the primary and secondary infections. Cellular responses in the blood, spleen and BAL were assessed by flow cytometry after CLP (Days 1, 3 & 8) and after pneumonia (4 & 12 h). We also studied lymphocyte apoptosis and dendritic cells (DC) expression of CD40, CD86, and MHCII. Bacterial clearance was assessed in the BAL and in the blood 4 and 12 h after pneumonia. Continuous variables represented as mean \u00b1 SD were compared using Student t test. Kaplan-Meier curves were compared by the log rank test. P < 0.05 indicated statistically significant differences. Results Whereas treatment with TSA did not change survival after CLP, TSA improved survival after tracheal instillation of P. aeruginosa (P = 0.009, Fig. 22 ). TSA-treated mice had significantly higher absolute DC, T and B-lymphocytes counts with reduced lymphocyte apoptosis after CLP. Four hours after secondary pneumonia, TSA-treated mice had significantly higher DC counts and improved bacterial clearance in the BAL, with reduced systemic dissemination of P. aeruginosa. Conclusion HDAC inhibition with TSA improves survival in our murine model of secondary pneumonia, improves bacterial clearance and attenuate cellular features of SIIS. These results suggest that sepsisinduced epigenetic changes contribute to the advent of SIIS. Comprehensive characterization of epigenetic changes associated with SIIS might allow us to identify new therapeutic targets to reprogram immune cells in sepsis and avoid SIIS. length of ICU stay was 16 \u00b1 14 days. 47 patients acquired 58 NIs (36.2% BSI, 20.5% pneumonia, 10.3% CRI and 10.3% UTI. There was no bacteriological documentation of NI in 22.5% of cases. NIs occured 4 days post burns. The most three isolated pathogens were: Acinetobacter spp. (31%), P. aeruginosa (22.5%) and extended spectrum betalactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (17%). The most frequently administered antibiotics were polymyxin/carbapenem/teicoplanin combination (21%), polymyxin/carbapenem combination (15%) and carbapenem/tigecycline combination (15%). In our study, mortality rate was 50%. Conclusion Nosocomial infection occured in 24.7% of cases in burn patients, caused by Acinetobacter spp, P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae BLSE. So, eradication of infection in burn patients require effective surveillance and infection control in order to reduce mortality rates, length of hospitalization and associated costs.",

Although the attributable mortality of ventilator associated pneumonia remains debated, the recurrence of these infections is always associated with a significant morbidity (2) . Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-sensitive (SAMS) is one of the most frequently germs involved in ICU pneumonia especially in trauma patients. The aim of the study was to establish the risk factors associated with microbiological treatment failure of pneumonia, caused by SAMS. Materials and methods we retrospectively identified 185 patients who developed a first episode of ventilator associated pneumonia caused by SAMS during a 6 years-period (2009-2014). The primary end point was the microbiological treatment failure defined as a second episode of pneumonia caused by SAMS corresponding to either a persistent or a recurrence of the pneumonia (Fig. 23) . The primary aim of the study was to identify factors associated with a treatment failure, the secondary objective was to identify factors associated with the occurrence of second episode (i.e. persistent, recurrence, superinfection and/or relapse of pneumonia caused by any bacteria) during or after treatment of the first episode caused by SAMS. Definition of outcomes was based after analysis of current concepts available in the literature. Factors associated with primary and secondary objectives in univariate analysis (p-value < 0.20), or clinically relevant ones, were entered in a multivariate logistic regression. The final selection was performed using the stepwise selection based on the Akaike criterion. Results Fifty-nine patients (33.3%) developed a second episode of pneumonia and among them, 30 (16.6%) were considered as a microbiological failure. In a multivariate analysis, the association of oropharyngeal flora (FOP) with the SAMS (OR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.33-11.11; p = 0.011) and the need of emergency surgery (OR, 5.26; 95% CI, 1.39-35.2; p = 0.035) were predictive of a microbiological failure. Empirical antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.15-4.51; p = 0.017) and performing emergency surgery (OR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.34-9.65; p = .011) were predictors of a second episode of pneumonia caused by any bacteria. Conclusion In this retrospective, monocentric study, the co presence of orophryngeal flora and the need of emergency surgery were associated with microbiological failure of pneumonia caused by SAMS in ICU.",

Proportional Assisted Ventilation (PAV) is a ventilatory mode that adjusts the level of ventilator assistance to the activity of respiratory muscles estimated by an algorithm. To date, PAV has been mostly studied in patients without severe dyspnea or asynchrony. We hypothesized that, compared to pressure support ventilation (PSV), PAV will prevent severe dyspnea or asynchrony. Patients and methods Were included ICU mechanically ventilated patient exhibiting severe dyspnea or asynchrony with PSV. Three conditions were successively studied: 1) PSV on inclusion (Baseline), 2) PSV after optimisation of ventilator settings in order to minimize dyspnoea and asynchrony (Optimisation), and 3) PAV. Ten-minutes recording were performed with each condition. The intensity of dyspnea was assessed by the Visual Analogic State (VAS, only in patients able to communicate) and by the Intensive Care Respiratory Distress Operating Scale (IC-RDOS) for all the patients. The electrical activity (EMG) of extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscles was measured. The  Fig. 24 Bayesian NMA with random effect prevalence of asynchrony was quantified by the visual inspection of the airway flow and pressure traces. Results 34 patients were included, 74% male, aged 66 [58-78] years, SAPS2 57 [39-66], mechanically ventilated for 6 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] days. The tidal volume (Tv) was higher in the Optimisation and PAV than in the Basal condition (Table 27 ). The respiratory rate(RR) was lower with PAV than in the other conditions. The dyspnea-VAS was lower with Optimisation and PAV than with the Basal conditions. The IC-RDOS was lower with PAV than with the two other conditions. The asynchrony index was lower with PAV than with the two other conditions. Parasternal EMG activity was lower with PAV and Optimisation (Fig. 25) . Conclusion In ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation with PSV and exhibiting severe dyspnea or asynchrony, the optimisation of ventilator settings with PSV and the PAV mode decrease in the simiar way the severity of dyspnea and the prevalence of patient-ventilator asynchrony.",

However, performing arterial blood gases at the end of SBT is not routinely recommended whereas EtCO2may be routinely monitored during a low pressure support SBT. The aim of this prospective observational study was to determine the clinical usefulness of EtCO2 to predict extubation failure. Patients and methods We recorded clinical data and EtCO2 during a successful 1 h low level pressure support SBT (at the beginning, after 5 min and at the end of the trial). Patients ventilated through tracheostomy and unplanned extubations were excluded. Extubation failure was defined as death or the need for reintubation within 72 h (1) after extubation; this delay was prolonged to 7 days (2) in case of noninvasive ventilation after extubation, which was systematic in older patients or those with cardiorespiratory disease, as per our weaning protocol. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent variables associated with extubation failure. Results One hundred and fifteen ventilated patients were enrolled in our study from July 2015 to June 2016. The median age of these patients was 63 [52-75] years, their median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II was 48 [38-61] points and 42.5% (n = 49) were female. Seventeen (15%) patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Reintubation rate was 15% (n = 18). EtCO2 at other time points as well as its changes during the SBT were also similar between groups. The three variables predicting extubation failure in the multivariable logistic regression model were a past medical history of cirrhosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome before weaning and lower minute ventilation at the end of SBT. Conclusion EtCO2 during a successful SBT seems useless to predict outcome of extubation.",

However, most of the studies assessing predictive factors of extubation failure did not separate airway from weaning failure. We aimed to describe incidence of extubation failure in critically ill patients, separating for the first time airway from weaning failure, in a prospective multicenter observational study. Patients and methods A prospective, observational, multicenter study was conducted in 26 French ICUs. All adult patients consecutively extubated in ICU were included. An ethics committee approved the study design (code UF: 9242, register: 2013-A01402-43). The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (identifier no.NCT 02450669). Clinical parameters were prospectively assessed before, during and after extubation procedure. Extubation failure was defined as the need to reintubate less than 48 h after extubation. Extubation failure could be due to airway failure, weaning failure or mixed airway and weaning failure. Results From December 2013 to May 2015, 1514 intubation-procedures were studied in 1465 patients from 26 centers. 49 patients (3.2%) were intubated twice. The median number of intubation-procedures included by center was 27 . The flow chart of the study is shown in Fig. 26 . Incidence of extubation failure was 10.4% (157 of 1514 intubation-procedures). Incidence of airway failure, weaning failure and mixed failure were respectively 4.6% (70 of 1514), 5.2% (78 of 1514) and 0.6% (9 of 1514).",

The etiology of cirrhosis was alcoholic (n = 6) or post-HCV (n = 1). The reasons of ACLF were acute alcoholic hepatitis (n = 2), variceal bleeding (n = 2) and sepsis (n = 3). Prior to TPE, the mean scores of SOFA, CLIF-SOFA, CLIF-OF, MELD and Child-Pugh were respectively 9.4, 12, 11.7, 37.6 and C12.5.

TPE worth to be Fig. 26 Flow chart of the FREE-REA study Introduction Extubation is a key moment for the patient on his way to recovery. Extubation failure concerns 10-20% of ICU patients and is closely linked to nosocomial pneumonia. The practice concerning enteral feeding interruption at time of extubation has not been investigated. Fasting before extubation may prevent aspiration and development of nosocomial pneumonia. Thus, fasting and gastric content suctioning before extubation may be reasonably considered as a mean to reduce this burden. Fasting before extubation may prevent aspiration and development of nosocomial pneumonia. Thus, fasting and gastric content suctioning before extubation may be reasonably considered as a mean to reduce this burden. However, fasting, as recommended before elective general anesthesia is likely to be ineffective in the setting of extubation in the ICU, due to patients' gastroparesis and prolonged gastric stasis. Beyond the potentially unnecessary burden in terms of paramedical workload, fasting may have some side effects such as caloric deficit, hypoglycemia, or delayed extubation. Given the current lack of objective data concerning the clinical practice of feeding/fasting and gastric tube suctioning before extubation in the ICU, we undertook this descriptive study to assess current practice. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study in eleven intensive care units in the west of France over a 1 month timespan. All patients extubated were included and data about enteral feeding during the peri-extubation period as well as extubation failure and nosocomial that pneumonia occured within 7 days were recorded. Data observed in the eleven participating centers were completed with a short email survey concerning declarative practice performed among 43 intensive care units. Results During the study period, 162 patients were included. Overall, 25 patients (15%) failed extubation and needed reintubation within the 7 days following planned extubation. Pneumonia was significantly more frequent reintubated patients than the other (36 vs. 4%, p < 0.01). Hundred patients (62%) received enteral feeding at the time of extubation. Compared to patients who did not receive enteral feeding, those patients had a higher disease severity (SAPSII score 50, [41; 63] vs. 45 [35; 52], p < 0.01; longer duration of mechanical ventilation 7 [4; 13] vs. 1.5 [1; 3] days, p < 0.01). Accordingly, those patients had a higher rate of extubation failure (21 vs. 7%, p = 0.01) and pneumonia (13 vs. 3%, p = 0.05). Among the 100 patients receiving enteral feeding, fasting was implemented before extubation for 64 patients (64%). Similarly, the incidence of pneumonia was not different between groups (n = 9 (14%) vs. n = 4 (11%), p = 0.76). After extubation, the fasting patients experienced a longer delay until feeding resumption as compared to non-fasting patients (21 h [6; 42] vs. 8 [5; 22] ), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Overall gastric content suctioning before extubation was not commonly performed; before extubation: 30% of the fasting patients and 26% of the non fasting patients. Among the 11 participating centers, while some centers imposed a fasting period before extubation to all their patients, some did it infrequently. However, no center never imposed fasting, illustrating between and within center heterogeneity. This heterogeneity was confirmed on the larger scale declarative email survey (88% response rate amont 43 units) which showed that only 44% of the units had a written standardized operational procedure for extubation. Survey respondents reported to practice fasting before extubation \"Always\", \"Frequently\" and \"Never or Rarely\" in respectively 71, 21 and 8% of cases. Conclusion Both practices, fasting as well as pursued nutrition until extubation are commonly performed in ICUs, with little standardization of practice. Safety seems equivalent, as no clinically significant difference in terms of reintubation rate and pneumonia were observed. Thus, the equipoise condition appears met to undertake a trial evaluating feeding strategies in the peri-extubation period.",

Patients were censored after 28 days of follow-up. Choice among collinear variables was performed considering clinical relevance, rate of missing variables and reproducibility of definitions. Results were given as hazard ratio (HR) for Cox models and subdistribution hazard ratios (sHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The impact on duration of stay was estimated by a multivariate Poisson regression. P values less than 0.05 were considered as significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC). Results During the study period, 16,734 patients were included in the database and 1075 met inclusion criteria. Among them, 622 received no nutrition; 28 received enteral nutrition, 74 received parenteral nutrition only, and 351 received oral nutrition only. Overall, 86 patients developed ICU-acquired pneumonia (8%), 158 required invasive mechanical ventilation (14.7%) and 161 died before day-28 (15%). Median length of stay was 6 days [4; 9]. After adjustment for confounders, type of nutrition support was associated with an increase day-28 mortality (P = 0.02). Compared to oral nutrition, enteral nutrition was associated with an increase day-28 mortality [sHR 2.91, 95% CI 1.44-5.89; P = 0.003] whereas parenteral nutrition and no nutrition did not influence this outcome. The type of nutrition was not associated with the occurrence of ICU-acquired pneumonia (P = 0.18). However, patients who received enteral nutrition experienced more frequently ICU-acquired pneumonia [sHR = 3.00, 95% CI 1.08-8.37; P = 0.036] as compared to oral nutrition patients. Ventilator free days within the 28 days were negatively associated with the type of nutrition (P < 0.0001). Compared to oral nutrition, parenteral and enteral nutrition were negatively associated with ventilator free days within the 28 days [RR per day = 1.48, 95% CI 1.22-1.78; P < 0.0001 and RR per day = 1.77, 95% CI 1.37-2.30; P < 0.0001]. Delta PaCO 2 measured between the first 2 days was not associated with any type of nutrition. Conclusion More than half the patients receiving NIV were fasting within the first two NIV days. Oral nutrition was prescribed for onethird of them and was well tolerated. Lack of feeding or underfeeding had no impact on mortality and ventilator free days within the 28 days. However, enteral nutrition was associated with an increased occurrence of ICU-aquired pneumonia and a higher mortality rate. was high, caloric debt during temporary ECLS was low in comparison with previous results [1] . Overnutrition was frequent in the NEC group and would justify implementation of nutrition protocol. Incidence of GI intolerance remains frequent and could justify systematic used of motility agents with introduction of EN. Conclusion Enteral nutrition in patients treated with temporary extracorporeal life support is feasible and may be improve with systematic motility agents and implementation of nutritional protocol.",

Lymphocytes are essential agents of innate and adaptive immune responses during infections or inflammation processes. Lymphopenia has been associated with immune dysfunction during septic shock, and it has been shown that low absolute lymphocyte count was predictive of postoperative sepsis (2) . Furthermore, impaired lymphocyte function probably occurs after CPB. Thus, we investigated mechanisms involved in postoperative lymphopenia and impaired lymphocyte function after CPB. The aims of this study were: 1) To describe a potential relationship between lymphopenia and occurrence of postoperative infections. 2) To demonstrate that CPB induces lymphocytes apoptosis. 3) To demonstrate that CPB impaired lymphocyte function (ability to proliferate). 4) To demonstrate that IL-10, PD-L1 (programmed cell death 1 ligand 1) and Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) could be interesting targets to restore lymphocyte ability to proliferate after CPB.

We have included 32 patients with candidemia and 54 controls (27 matched hospitalized controls and 27 healthy subjects). The sera of cases were gathered before (almost 5 days before), during and after the isolation of yeasts from blood culture, defined as day 0 (D0). Quantitative analysis of 28 cytokines by Luminex \u00ae technology and of (1,3)-\u03b2-d-glucans by Fungitell \u00ae test were performed on 132 samples. The amplitude of Th profile response was expressed by summing the amount of the most relevant cytokines for Th1, Th2 and Th17 profiles, in pg/ mL. For each patient, the highest level of response was considered as 100%. Results are expressed for the population by means of the results. We then performed univariate analysis (Fischer exact test for qualitative variables, Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon test for quantitative variables, Spearman for correlation; GraphPad Prism V6 software) and a multidimensional analysis by principal component analysis (PCA; IgorPro software). Results Patients with candidemia exhibited an increase in proinflammatory cytokines (IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 and IL-12), in comparison with the anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) before D0 (p = 0.034) in univariate analysis. The ratio between mean values reverses at D2 and D3 (p = 0.02) and the increase of Th2 response level from D0 to D4 is correlated to the decrease of Th1 response (r = \u22120.885; p = 0.033) in univariate analysis and PCA. A pro-inflammatory response (Th1) is associated with a reduced mortality (RR = 0.58 [0.34; 0.98]) and with a lower \u03b2-D-glucans levels (p < 0.0001). Discussion We describe here a dynamic cytokine profiles in response to candidemia. Pro-inflammatory response predominates before D0 and reverses after. This is contradictory to the postulate that an antiinflammatory background could predispose to invasive candidiasis in ICU patients and exhibiting a \"Post-infectious immune suppression conditions\". But the relative deficiency in Th1 response compared to simultaneous anti-inflammatory cytokines secretion observed after CBI is in accordance with experimental data, suggesting the modulation of the immune response by Candida. The link between cytokinic profile and mortality can also raise the hypothesis of an influence by genetic factors on the regulation and direction of the immune response and so, the existence of a high-risk population.",

These data will be paralleled to genetic background and to circulating Candida derived molecules to precise the relative part of the host and the pathogen in this complex interaction. Introduction Lung ultrasound is widely used in intensive care, ermergency and pneumology medicine, for assessing acute respiratory pathologies. It is noninvasive, radiation free and rapidly available at the patient's bedside and provides an excellent accuracy. So, lung ultrasound may be an interesting tool for the physiotherapist as it allows to assess with more accuracy the patient improving the chest physiotherapy indication and monitoring (1) .",

This case report highlights the lung ultrasound interest in chest physiotherapy in patient with lung consolidation. Patients and methods This was a case report written following the recommendations of the CARE guideline (2). The case was a 68-years-old female patient, non intubated, hospitalized in a respiratory ICU. She was hypoxemic (PaO 2 = 59 mmHg and SaO 2 = 89%), with dyspnoea at rest and an increasing radiological opacity at the right lung base. Hypoxemia was the indication for physiotherapist referral. At the clinical examination, the physiotherapist's findings were: decreased mobility, dullness and abolished vesicular sound at the base of right hemithorax. This clinical examination and chest x-rays analysis allowed the physiotherapist to propose several clinical hypotheses: pleural effusion, obstructive atelectasis or pneumonia. The chest physiotherapy treatment differs according to the type of lung deficiencies. For example, the physiotherapist must to refer the patient to the medical staff in case of pleural effusion or may implement hyperinflation technique in case of obstructive atelectasis. Determining the nature of lung deficiencies is essential to provide the more suitable therapeutic strategy. So, the physiotherapist decided to perform a lung ultrasound examination to retain the more likely hypothesis. Results Ultrasound examination performed by the physiotherapist highlighted the presence of a lung consolidation at the infero-lateral and posterior parts of the right lung with a pneumonia pattern: presence of tissue-like sign, shred sign, dynamic air bronchogram and fluid bronchogram. The medical staff implemented antibiotic treatment. The ultrasound findings guided the physiotherapist to choose chest physiotherapy technique improving the alveolar recruitment: nearly prone position (left side down) and continuous positive airway pressure during 45 min. The patient response to the treatment was monitored by ultrasound and showed a decrease of the lung consolidation size and apparition of B lines, meaning a gain of lung aeration. These findings were associated with SpO 2 improvement but without decrease of dyspnoea. Discussion Lung ultrasound allowed the physiotherapist to precise the nature of the radiological lung opacity. As it is more accurate than clinical examination or chest x-ray, this suggests a more suitable choice of chest physiotherapy techniques than conventional clinical decision-making process. Ultrasound findings suggested a positive response to the chest physiotherapy treatment. The apparition of re-aeration signs (B lines, decreased consolidation size) showed a short-term efficacy of the chest physiotherapy treatment. This allowed the physiotherapist to continue the treatment during 1 week and obtain a substantial clinical improvement. Conclusion The use of lung ultrasound in the clinical decision-making process may help the physiotherapist to choose with more accuracy the therapeutic strategy. Moreover, it allows to monitor the treatment in real-time and assess the patient's response. The use of this tool may allow the physiotherapist to determine the optimal indications for chest physiotherapy and thus avoid unnecessary or inappropriate treatments.",

            "text": "Introduction Critical illness together with immobilization have deleterious effects on patients outcome, especially in the presence of sepsis. Increased muscle catabolism and membrane inexcitability reduce muscular mass and impair function within the first days after sepsis onset (1). Early mobilization could potentially limit muscle wasting and functional impairment in this population. The purpose of this study was to test whether exercise during the early phase of sepsis is safe and beneficial and to which extent it can limit skeletal muscle protein catabolism and preserve function. Patients and methods Adult patients admitted with the diagnosis of severe sepsis were included and randomly allocated to two groups; 1) Control group (Ctrl-G): manual passive/active manual mobilization twice a day or 2) Experimental group (Exp-G): additional two times 30 min of passive/active cycling exercise. Both groups benefited from a reduced sedation, adjusted nutritional intake and bed to chair transfer as soon as possible. Skeletal muscle biopsy and electrophysiological testing were realized at day-1 and day-7. Muscle histology, biochemical and molecular analyses of anabolic/catabolic and inflammatory signalling pathways were performed. A group of four healthy subjects was used to obtain non pathological values. Hemodynamic parameters and patients perception were collected during each session. Results Twenty-one patients were included, however 3 died before the second muscle biopsy. Ten patients in Ctrl-G and nine in Exp-G were finally analysed. Muscle fibre cross sectional area (\u00b5m 2 ) was significantly preserved by exercise (relative changes were Ctrl-G: \u221245 \u00b1 41% vs Exp-G:12 \u00b1 19%, p = 0.001). Markers of catabolic systems were highly increased during sepsis compared to healthy subjects and reduced in both groups 7 days after admission. However the reduction in mRNA (relative change) tended to be more important in Exp-G: MURF-1 (Ctrl-G: \u221231 \u00b1 67% vs Exp-G: \u221263 \u00b1 45%, p = 0.15), MAFbx (Ctrl-G: \u22127 \u00b1 138% vs Exp-G: \u221256 \u00b1 37%, p = 0.23), LC3b (Ctrl-G: 5 \u00b1 47% vs Exp-G: \u221221 \u00b1 18%, p = 0.18) and Bnip3 (Ctrl-G: 27 \u00b1 198% vs Exp-G: \u221259 \u00b1 23%, p = 0.02). Anabolic and inflammatory markers were not affected by exercise. Electrophysiological testing, including direct muscular stimulation, was abnormal on Day-1 in 10 of 13 evaluated patients. Since only a limited number of patients could be reassessed a second time, comparison between groups was not possible.",

Patients admitted in adult ICU of Marie Lannelongue hospital, France, who were mechanically ventilated for at least 3 days were included. Exclusion criteria were cerebral or spinal injury, pelvic or lower limb fracture. Patients were assessed each day for temporary contraindications for mobilization out of bed (RASS score <\u22122 or >1; hemodynamic instability; a continuous intravenous dose of epinephrine/ . No significant difference was observed in terms of MRC score or in terms of pts with or without weakness (MRC > 48) at ICU or hospital discharge. However, the number of pts with weakness was significantly higher in the group before Tilt mobilization, suggesting a more rapid improvement in the tilt group. The ICU and hospital lengths of stay were not different between groups. Discussion The prevalence of muscle weakness in our population is high before mobilization (90.6%, 95% CI 85.2-95.6), is still 48.6% at ICU discharge but represents only ~ 1% at hospital discharge. This low hospital discharge prevalence is probably related to the early and intense physiotherapy in both groups, which may explain our inability to demonstrate superiority of the addition of tilt table positioning, although a faster recovery is suggested. Conclusion Training sessions using a tilt table, in addition to early and intense physiotherapy did not improve muscle strength evaluated using MRC score in surgical ICU patients with muscle weakness.",

Among those, pneumonia is of particular interest, as pregnancy impairs the ventilatory function, and blunts the immune response. In addition, pneumonia might increase fetal morbimortality. We, therefore, sought to investigate the epidemiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) occurring during pregnancy or postpartum (until 6 weeks postpartum) requiring ICU or intermediate care unit admission. Patients and methods We conducted a retrospective multicenter observational study in 41 Paris and suburban area ICUs participating in the CUBREA database (January 2005-December 2014). Women were identified through the ICD-10 database with an obstetric code (O00-O99 or Z35-Z39) and an acute respiratory failure (J96) or pneumonia code (J10-J22",

The FDO2 fluctuations according to the value of the MV are greater with the NOC to 4 L/min. In clinical situation, NOC is less used than the NC. Compared to the NC, NOC is an alternative to increase the FDO2 with the same OFR. NOC Introduction Nasal Cannula (NC) is an option to deliver oxygen therapy. According to American Thoracic Society (ATS), standard NC delivers a fractional delivered oxygen (FDO2) of 24-40% at supply oxygen flows ranging from 1 to 5 L/min. An equation was proposed by ATS to predict oxygen delivery: FDO2 = 20% + (4 * O2 L/min). Moreover, for ATS, FDO2 is also influenced by respiratory frequency (Rf ), tidal volume (Vt) and ratio Ti/Ttot. However, the equation of ATS does not take into account these parameters. Our hypothesis is that these parameters can significantly affect the FDO2. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Rf, Vt and Ti/Ttot on FDO2. IFR) obtained with settings range from 18 to 48 L/min. OFR was analyzed by a thermal mass flow meter Vogtlyn \u2122 Red Y. FDO2 and MV measurements were made using a iWorx \u00ae acquisition system (GA207 gas analyzer) and LabScribe II \u00ae software. Conclusion IFR and OFR are the main determinants of FDO2.

The aim of our study was to determine independent factors of hospital death in this specific population. Patients and methods This two-center retrospective study included all consecutive patients who were admitted to the ICU between January 2000 and December 2015 for a complicated AMI. Exclusion criteria were an inaugural cardiac arrest revealing AMI, a peri-operative AMI, and patients transferred to the ICU after emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for AMI. Patients with ventricular arrhythmias responsible for transient circulatory arrest during their management, with rapid recovery of normal consciousness were studied. In each patient, comorbidities, SAPS2 score, SOFA score upon ICU admission, and AMI complications including cardiogenic shock, transient circulatory arrest, pulmonary edema and mechanical complications (i.e., ruptured papillary muscle, ventricular septal defect, tamponade) were recorded. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine independent factors of hospital death. Results Among 358 patients admitted to the ICU with complicated AMI, 91 were excluded for inaugural cardiac arrest with sustained coma requiring therapeutic hypothermia (n = 60), emergency CABG for AMI (n = 17), or AMI after surgery (n = 43). Finally, 267 patients (1.4% of all admissions) were studied (180 men; mean age: 67 \u00b1 12 years; SAPS2: 57 \u00b1 21; SOFA: 8 \u00b1 4), 82% of them being ventilated. AMI complications were: cardiogenic shock (n = 191), pulmonary edema (n = 124), transient circulatory arrest (n = 60), and mechanical complication (n = 29). Prompt coronary angiography was performed in 215 patients (81%) and angioplasty in 167 of them (78%). Coronary angiography was not performed in 52 patients for hemodynamic instability preventing patient transportation (n = 40) or expired time of potential revascularization (n = 12). Only two of these patients had cardiogenic shock. Hospital mortality reached 46% (n = 122). Non survivors were older, had higher severity scores, were more frequently under mechanical ventilation and catecholamines, had lower ejection fraction (27 \u00b1 13 vs 37 \u00b1 12%: p = 0.0004), and exhibited higher lactate (8.1 \u00b1 5.1 vs 4.6 \u00b1 3.3 mmol/l: p = 0.0001) and creatinine levels (178 \u00b1 122 \u00b5mol/l vs 136 \u00b1 103 \u00b5mol/l: p = 0.0027) than survivors.

Advanced cooling methods of TTM seem the most effective. This prospective, monocentric, observational, open clinical study aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of a new esophageal device to perform TTM in such patients. Patients and methods The Esophageal Cooling Device (ECD \u00ae , Advanced Cooling Therapy, USA) is a semi-invasive multichambered silicone heat exchanger device, placed in the esophagus to provide highly efficient heat transfer, replacing the usual standard gastric tube. ECD is connected to a heat exchanger console Medi-therm III \u00ae (Gamida, France) performing the temperature's automatic feedback control. Main inclusion criteria were: OHCA from presumed cardiac cause needing TTM, delay between CA and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) <60 min, delay between ROSC and inclusion <240 min. Main exclusion criteria were: known esophageal disease, unstable ROSC and hemodynamic condition, severe cardiac conductive disorder requiring pacing. After achieving sustained ROSC and performing coronarography \u00b1 CT-scan, ECD was inserted as soon as possible. A target temperature (TT) of 33 \u00b0C was maintained for at least 24 h followed by a controlled rewarming (rate <0.5 \u00b0C/h). No cold fluids had to be used during TTM. Normothermia was maintained during the first 3 days after CA. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed systematically after removal of ECD.Results18 patients were enrolled in the study and 17 completed the study (median [IQR 25-75], age: 60yo [54-65], SAPSII: 69 [61-75], time to ROSC: 20 min [14-30], shockable rhythm 53%). Time to reach the TT was 15 h [10-17], with a mean cooling rate to reach TT of 0.26 \u00b0C/h [0.19-0.36]. The average time spend in the 32-34 \u00b0C-target range was 26 h [21-28]. All patients reached the 32-34 \u00b0C-target range (3 patients did not reach 33 \u00b0C). The temperature deviation out of the 33 \u00b0C-TT during the maintenance phase was 0.1 \u00b0C [0.03-0.20]. Five patients (36%) presented an episode of minor deviation (0.5\u00b0-1 \u00b0C), and one patient (6%) a deviation >1 \u00b0C versus the TT. Rewarming time was 16 h [12-20] and the mean rewarming rate was 0.20 \u00b0C/h [0.18-0.22].",

No data exists on how to improve teaching and evaluating the potential impact of stress. Main objective of our study was to validate stress measurement parameters during two simulated intubation conditions. Materials and methods 26 physicians were recruited (10 juniors/16 seniors) and equipped with various biometric sensors. All simulation sequences were videorecorded and physicians also weared eye-tracking glasses. Salivar cortisol measurements were performed after each sequence. Two situations were randomly tested, one in standard and easy intubation conditions, one under difficult conditions presumed to induce stress (monitoring alarms, mannikin lying on the floor, difficult intubation). Autoevaluations of video recordings and mental workload (MWL) were performed retrospectively. Results Few differences were depicted in-between junior and seniors. Physiological parameters modifications and a heart rate variability decrease were observed under the difficult intubation conditions (SDNN for juniors = 41.2 \u00b1 20.9 vs 29.7 \u00b1 12.4 ms; p = 0.015). Stress was demonstrated to increase MWL (Nasa-TLX = 39 \u00b1 18 vs. 63 \u00b1 15; p = 0.001), frustration being its determinant component (p = 0.033)(Fig. 11). Video-recordings depicted significant stress occurence under the difficult conditions, whatever the operator's experience. Conclusion Stress is an important component of success during intubation.",

For now it is just a static index but an ovo\u00efd vena cava (EI: 0.85) may be predicative of fluid responsiveness. The strangely big size of the VCI can be attributed to a deformation of the in-depth image because of the probe but this should not modify in theory the report of EI. It is a question in the future of testing this parameter at the spontaneous breathing patient, study his variability with respiration and strengthening its external validity.IntroductionThe Standards for the Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) statement was developed in 2003 to improve the quality of reporting of diagnosis studies (1). STARD is a list of 25 essential items, it was updated in 2015(2). Fluid responsiveness evaluation is a cornerstone of hemodynamic management of patient with circulatory failure. Numerous studies have evaluated tools for assessing fluid responsiveness. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the quality of reporting of studies assessing fluid responsiveness, using the STARD criteria. Materials and methods We used MEDLINE via PubMed to search all publication of studies assessing the ability to predict or diagnose fluid responsiveness in a perioperative or circulatory failure context between the 1st of January 2004 and the 1st of January 2014. We have presented herein the last 5 years (2010-2014). Paediatric studies, publication with no abstract available or in another language than English, review, meta-analysis, and journals with impact factor less than 2 were excluded. We have checked these studies for all the 25 STARD criteria. The rating methodology of each item was discussed and double checked (GI and MJL). The 2003 and 2015 STARD quality score (SQS) was the integer of the present item. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to find out if some characteristic of the studies were linked with a better SQS. Following items were studied: year of publication, positive or negative study, location of study, expert team, funding source, conflict of interest, the use of a new device, instruction to the author including STARD statement, impact factor of the journal. Every covariate associated with a p-value lower than 0.20 in the univariate analysis were used in the multivariate analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with R software. All the test were two-sided, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsAfter a double screening (GI, MJL) of 430 articles (2010-2014), 97 were selected, then 46 were excluded because of an IF < 2. Fifty-one studies were selected and reviewed. The mean 2003 overall quality score was 11.85 on a scale of 0-25, whereas the mean 2015 overall quality score was 15.34 on a scale of 0-30. The 2003 SQS remained stable between 2010 and 2014 (p = 0.173). Correlation between 2003and 2015 SQS was good (r = 0.83; p < 0.001).

Patients and methods Between February 2015 and September 2016, all cirrhotic patients admitted in ICU were prospectively included. We collected patient's clinical and biological parameters, especially ammonia levels, all the ongoing treatments, and seeked for the presence of evolutive infection defined as an infection considered as clinically relevant. Cirrhotic patients having encephalopathy and ammonia levels above 75 \u03bcmol/L were considered as having HE. We performed univariate and multivariate analysis to estimate the association between ammonia level, infection or drugs intake and the presence of encephalopathy. Results 202 cirrhotic patients were included, they were 58 \u00b1 11 yearsold, 71% were men. Etiology of cirrhosis was as followed: alcohol 40%) had evolutive infection and the following drugs were found: furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, betablockers, lactulose, rifaximine, betalactamins, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), quinolones, benzodiazepines, morphine derivatives, insulin, anti-epileptic drugs, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. In univariate analysis, patients with encephalopathy had significantly higher Child and MELD scores, higher ammonia, bilirubin and leukocytes levels, more evolutive infections, and received more frequently PPIs, lactulose and quinolones as compared to those who had no encephalopathy. Patients with encephalopathy took also more frequently an association of agonist of efflux pumps (e.g. PPIs, betalactamins or quinolones) (p = 0.0005). In the group of patients displaying low ammonia levels (less than 75 \u03bcmol/L), encephalopathy was significantly increased in patients having infection (p < 0.0001), taking quinolones (p = 0.0086), PPIs (p = 0.0196), and betalactamins (p = 0.0438) whereas ursodeoxycholic acid treatment had a protective effect (p = 0.0299). Multivariate analysis showed that high ammonia levels (p < 0.0001), presence of infection (p < 0.0001), and taking quinolones (p = 0.0403) were independently associated with the presence of encephalopathy. Conclusion These results highlight the involvement of drugs in the physiopathology of neurological impairment in cirrhotic patients. Several drugs that were implicated can modify the activity of efflux pumps expressed on the BBB. Besides HE, cirrhotic patients are susceptible to develop drugs-induced encephalopathy regardless of ammonia level, underlying the necessity to carefully assess every treatment indication, given their potential neurotoxicity.Introduction Little is known about the causes, clinical course and longterm outcome of prolonged hypoglycemic encephalopathy. We investigated functional long-term prognosis and identify prognosis factors of patients admitted in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with prolonged neurological manifestations related to obvious hypoglycemia. Patients and methods This was a retrospective study conducted in patients hospitalized from July 1, 2004, to July 1, 2014, in 9 polyvalent intensive care units in French university and general hospitals. Participants were adults admitted to the ICU with a Glasgow Coma Score <8 due to hypoglycemia <0.5 g/l and persistent consciousness disorders after normalizing blood glucose levels. Patients with possible other causes of consciousness disorders, previous cognitive disorders, hypothermia <35 \u00b0C or circulatory arrest within 24 h after ICU admission, were excluded. Follow-up phone call was used to determine the functional outcome using modified Rankin Scale at 1-year minimum (mRS) with mRS 0-3 defining good and mRS 4-6 poor outcomes. Results Forty-nine patients were included. Median age was 55 years. Causes of hypoglycemia were various, mainly including insulin or oral antidiabetic drugs abuse (65%) and neuroendocrine carcinoma (16%). Twenty (41%) patients died in the ICU, and a total of thirty-one (63%) patients had a poor outcome at 1-year follow-up. Twenty-two (45%) patients underwent therapeutic limitation, primarily due to no hope expected for improvement (86%). Among survivors with poor outcome at ICU discharge (n = 15), one died 10 months later and six improved their outcome at 1-year follow-up with a median decrease in mRS of \u22122 [IQR \u22122.5 to \u22121.75], including five patients who finally reached the good outcome group. Among the patients with good outcome on ICU discharge, one died, seven further improved their outcome at 1 year with a median decrease in mRS of \u22122 [IQR \u22122.0 to \u22121.0], whereas one patient deteriorated while remaining in the good outcome group (from mRS 1-2). On multivariate analysis, only low mRS prior to ICU admission (OR 2.6; 95% CI = 1.1-6.3; P = .03) and normal brain imaging (OR 7.1; 95% CI 1.1-44; P = .03) were significantly predictive of outcome. All patients (n = 15) who stayed hypoglycemic 480 min or more evolved poorly. Conclusion Poor outcome was observed in about 60% of this population of prolonged hypoglycemic encephalopathy. Some patients can recover satisfactorily over time though we did not identify any robust factor of good outcome. The lumbar puncture is an important tool of the etiologic investigations during status epilepticus. Scarce data are available regarding cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis directly induced by seizures. We aimed to describe the cerebrospinal fluid characteristics of the patients admitted to the intensive care unit for status epilepticus, and to report the clinical, biological and radiological data of these patients. Furthermore, to determine whether status epilepticus per se increases the cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, we specifically studied cerebrospinal fluid parameters after status epilepticus in adult patients after exclusion of the cases of status epilepticus induced by acute infection or neoplastic disease of the central nervous system. Patients and methods This monocentric retrospective study(2005- 2012)  included patients of more than 18 years old admitted to the intensive care unit for status epilepticus and who had a lumbar puncture. Status epilepticus was defined by a single seizure lasting more than 5 min or multiple seizures without neurological recovery in between. A cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis was defined by a cerebrospinal fluid cell count of more than 4/mm 3 . We analyzed demographic, medical, biological data and outcomes at 3 months and 1 year. The groups were compared using univariate and multivariate analysis. Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis was considered directly linked to seizures when etiologic investigations identified causes of status epilepticus which were not known to induce cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. Results Among 191 patients admitted to the intensive care unit for status epilepticus, 124 (65%) had a lumbar puncture and were included. Eight of them had a cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis of infectious or neoplastic origin. Among the 116 remaining patients, 97 (84% = group B2) had normal cerebrospinal fluid parameters, and 19 (16% = group B1) had a cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis considered as directly linked to seizures, with a median [Q1-Q3] cerebrospinal fluid cell count of 8/mm3[7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. No other cerebrospinal fluid parameters changes were observed in the two groups, unless a slight increase in the cerebrospinal fluid lactate (mmol/l), but without significant difference between the two groups (3.1 [2.7-3.4] group B1 vs 2.9 [2.5-3.5] group B2). In the multivariate analysis, only myoclonic status epilepticus (OR 55.1; CI 95% 6.02-1103.88; p = 0.001) and leukocytosis at the admission (OR 1.1 per 103/mm3 increment; CI95% 1.01-1.21; p = 0.01) were associated to pleocytosis directly linked to status epilepticus. The intensive care unit mortality was significantly increased in patients with pleocytosis directly linked to status epilepticus (5 (26%) vs 7 (7%), p = 0.02), but hospital mortality was not significantly different between the 2 groups.",

Electroencephalograms were prospectively classified by electrophysiologist according to the Synek score and NSE were performed within H48-72 post cardiac arrest. Results Among 162 cardiac arrest survivors, 70 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received sedation with midazolam and sufentanil and mild therapeutic hypothermia for 24 h. Forty-eight were classified as poor outcome (CPC \u2265 3) and 22 as good outcome (CPC 1-2).

These measures are often gathered in groups of 3 or 5 under the term of \"ventilator-bundle. \" The effectiveness of these \"bundles\" was poorly evaluated in African environment. Objective To establish a VAP prevention program and assess its impact on morbidity and mortality of patients under mechanical ventilation in our service. Patients and methods Prospective, mono centric, quasi-experimental before-after study. It took place in the intensive care unit of the University Clinics of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This service is equipped with 8 beds and a respirator for two beds. The observational period (phase1) was carried out from February 1st to December 31st, 2014 and the intervention period (phase2) from February 15st, 2015 to February 15st, 2016. All consecutive patients intubated and mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h were included. Five preventive measures were held: hand hygiene, the elevation of the head of the bed at 30\u00b0-45\u00b0, the daily lifting of sedation, oral decontamination with chlorhexidine and control cuff pressure of the endotracheal tube. Compliance with this bundle was assessed by direct observation without the knowledge of caregivers. The diagnosis of \"VAP\" was held before a clinically modified sore (m CPIS) >6. The main outcomes were the incidence of VAP and mortality. The protocol for this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Public Health of the University of Kinshasa, under the approval number: ESP/EC/015/2015.Introduction Nosocomial infections (NI) are common in burn patients due to the loss of the first line of defense against microbial invasion, immunocompromising effects of burn injury, and invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The objective of this study was to identify the incidence of nosocomial infection (NI), the pathogens and their antibacterial patterns, and prognosis of these burn patients. Patients and methods A retrospective study was conducted in a 20 bed intensive burn care unit during 6 months. Patients were eligible for the study, if they met the following criteria: total burn surface area (TBSA) > 10%, length of ICU stay \u226548 h, and infected in accordance with the criteria of the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) and the criteria of the SFETB [1][2]. In this study, NIs were classified into four main groups: pneumonias, bloodstream infections (BSI), catheter related infections (CRI), and urinary tract infections (UTI). For included patients, skin levy, blood cultures, urine and sputum cultures were drawn during fever or clinical features of sepsis. Results During the 6-month study period, 190 patients were admitted to the ICU, 47 patients were included (24.7%). 32 were male and 15 female. The mean age was 41 \u00b1 19 yr. The mean TBSA was 41 \u00b1 24%. 63% were admitted from another hospital. Burn injuries were due to domestic accidents in 53% and self immolation in 25%. The mean ",

The fungal cell wall component (1,3)-betad-glucan (BG) is a biomarker for fungal infection but its utility remains uncertain. This prospective study was designed to review our experience in IFD and to evaluate the impact of BG in the diagnosis of IFD. Patients and methods From January 2013 to May 2016, 271 liver transplantation were performed in our institution. Serum samples were tested for BG (Fungitell; Cape Cod Inc., USA) least weekly between liver transplantation and their discharge from hospital. IFD was defined as proposed by the European Organization for research and treatment of Cancer/mycoses study group. Results Nineteen patients (7%) were diagnosed with IFD including 13 cases of Candidiasis infection (CI) in eleven out of 271 patients, 8 invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (including one who had previously CI) and one case of septic arthritis of the hip caused by Scedosporium spp. IFD was associated with significantly high mortality (log-rank p = 0.003). The area under the ROC curves, for BG to predict IFD, was 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.83). Using a cutoff of 139 pg/ml, the most discriminative cut-off point from the ROC curve, The sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) values of BG for overall IFD was 68% (95% CI, 59-77), 79% (95% CI, 76-78), 24% (95% CI, 19-30) and 96% (95% CI, 95-97). Conclusion Based on its high NPV, BG value appears to be a good biomarker to rule out the diagnosis of IFD when the value is below 139 pg/ml. A single point BG may guide the investigation and the decision to start antifungal therapy in patients at risk for IFD.",

            "text": "Introduction Systemic rheumatic diseases (SRD) are autoimmune diseases that are rare but cause substantial morbidity and mortality. SRDs chiefly affect the lungs, however, data on critically ill patients with SRD admitted for ARF are scarce. Patients and methods Retrospective cohort conducted in 10 French ICUs (2009 . The major comorbidities were cardiovascular (49%), tobacco exposure (25%), chronic kidney disease (18%) and neoplasia (15%). Two-thirds of patients were on systemic corticosteroids at admission, the median dose of 10 (IQR) mg per day. SRD diagnosis was made in the ICU in 11.5% of patients. Clinically or microbiologically documented bacterial pneumonia was the leading ARF etiology (40.9%). In 32% of cases, ARF was related to an opportunistic infection (mainly Aspergillus (n = 8) and Pneumocystis (n = 7)). Others ARF etiologies included specific lung involvement (23.2%) and cardiac pulmonary edema (20.7%). SOFA on day one was 5 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Associated organ dysfunctions were mainly hemodynamic (42%) and renal (45%). Mechanical ventilation was needed in 68% of patients (non invasive only in 17.3% or invasive in 82.7%), 40% needed vasopressors, and 30% renal replacement therapy. Systemic corticosteroids were started in 20% of patients and 23% of patients received pulse steroids. Cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange were required in 10 and 11% of patients, respectively. Length of ICU stay was 7 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] days. ICU-acquired infection occurs in 25% of cases. In total, 59 patients (24.9%) died throughout the ICU stay. ARF etiology was not associated with mortality. By multivariate analysis, shock on admission (OR 6.25 [2.71-14 .40], p < 0.001) and the use of invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 5.06 [1.84-13 .94], p = 0.02) were independently associated with mortality, whereas non-invasive ventilation was associated with decreased mortality (OR 0.31 [0.12-0.81], p = 0.02). By considering among the connective tissue diseases, the groups of myositis and scleroderma (n = 61), these diseases were associated with a trend for a higher mortality (OR 2.08 [0.95-4.55], p = 0.06). Conclusion In patients with SRD, ARF is associated with a high case fatality, primarily when mechanical ventilation is needed. Particular attention must be given to specific SRD-sub groups for which pulmonary flare may require intensive immunosuppression.",

We sought to assess how ICU nurses actually rank their involvement and perceive this process. Materials and methods We conducted a cross sectional survey using a web-based questionnaire between June and September 2016. Results Of the 38 ICUs invited to participate, 22 (58%) agreed. A total of 541 ICU participants completed the survey of whom 73% were nurses and 26% assistant nurses. Median age was 31 (Inter Quartile Range 27-38) years and 84% were female. Median work experience was 7 (4-12) years and time in the ICU was 5 (3-8) years. Eighty-five percent of the participants have been involved at least once in a multidisciplinary end-of-life discussion. Less than half of the participants reported a good (4%) or partial (44%) knowledge of the current end-of-life legal framework. The decision to start a discussion about Withdraw Life-Sustaining Therapy (WLST) was initiated by a senior intensivist in 83% of the cases, by a nurse in 5% and an assistant nurse in 0.6%. This decision was approved by 97% of the participants. The decision-making process was considered to be initiated at the right time for 49% of the participants, too late for 48%, and too early for 3%. The discussion occurred mostly in the afternoon (38%) or during the medical staff (22%), in a dedicated place in 63% of the cases. A median of 7 (5-10) health-care professionals attended the WLST discussion. Half the respondents reported being reluctant to talk during the discussions and 11% never expressed their own opinion. Indeed, although the length of the discussion was 30 (15-45) minutes, participants estimated to talk during only 3 (1-5) minutes. The following reasons were mentioned by the participants to explain these facts: having cared for the patient for too short time (62%), lack of medical knowledge (35%), decision of WLST already taken by the medical staff (31%), their opinion not really taken into account (19%), reluctant to talk during meetings in general (18%), consider that the discussion is limited to a medical expertise (15%), limited professional experience (14%), and fear to express a different opinion (12%). Nevertheless, 84% of the participants were partially (76%) or totally (8%) satisfied by the way the decision making process was conducted, 81% considered that collegiality was applied, and 93% agreed with the final decisions.Conclusion ICU nurses rank favorably multidisciplinary WLST discussions. Nevertheless their involvement in the discussion remains limited. Beyond factors related to work organization and professional experience, efforts should be made to recognize their role and value, and to encourage them to share their own opinions with the other members of the ICU team.",

MV duration is associated with an increased risk of ventilator associated events, even though its specific impact on mortality has never been clearly demonstrated (1). Automated closed loop systems might help the weaning process. A recently published meta-analysis has reported a reduction in MV duration when using an automated weaning mode as compared to non-automated mode (2) . However, the different automated modes have not been compared to each other. The objective of this network meta-analysis was to compare the performance of the three major automated weaning modes, i.e. the Automode\u00b0, the Smartcare\u00b0 and the Adaptative Support Ventilation (ASV\u00b0) for MV weaning in critically ill and postoperative adult patients.",

The three modes of automated modes included in the study were ASV\u00b0, Smartcare\u00b0 and Automode\u00b0. The primary outcome was the duration of MV weaning, defined as the time between randomization and a successful extubation. We also planned subgroup analyses in the ICU and the post-operative populations. The quality of the studies was assessed independently by two blinded investigators, using the evaluation recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. A network Bayesian meta-analysis using random effect models and based on aggregate data from the included studies was performed using the gemtc package (R project, Vienna). This trial was declared in PROS-PERO in August 2015 (CRD42015024742). Results Search of databased identified 776 articles; 233 were screened for eligibility after removal of duplicates. Abstract analysis led to the exclusion of 191 articles with a final full text analysis of 42 randomised control trials. Ultimately, 15 trials were included in the analysis, representing 1424 ventilated patients. Nine studies included patients in the post-operative period while six were conducted in ICU. The automated mode was ASV\u00b0 (A) in 9 studies, Smartcare\u00b0 (C) in 4 studies and Auto-mode\u00b0 (B) in 2 studies. All studies reported the duration of MV weaning as defined in our protocol. In all studies, the control group was standard care with a weaning process driven either by nurses or physicians. In 12 studies (75%) a written weaning protocol was used in the control group. All ICU studies used sedation protocols based on sedation scores, none of them including systematic daily sedation interruption. Each one of the automated application was associated with a significant reduction in the duration of MV as compared to the control. When comparing all different modes using the network meta-analysis framework, ASV\u00b0 appeared to be the best automated mode when it pertains to reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation weaning (Fig. 24) . Subgroup analysis showed similar results in the post-operative and the ICU populations. Conclusion Compared to standard weaning practice, the 3 major automated weaning modes significantly reduced the duration of MV weaning in critically ill and post-operative adult patients. ASV\u00b0 was associated with the most significant effect when compared to the two other automated modes (Smartcare\u00b0, Automode\u00b0). Further physiological respiratory studies would help to understand the underlying mechanisms accounting for the superiority of ASV.",

Ultrasound measurements of diaphragm thickness (Tdi), excursion (EXdi) and thickening fraction (TFdi) have been proposed as estimators of diaphragm function, but have never been compared to phrenic nerve stimulation. Our aim was to describe the relationship between Tdi, EXdi, TFdi and diaphragm function evaluated using the change in endotracheal pressure after phrenic nerve stimulation (Ptr,stim), and to compare their prognostic value. Patients and methods Ptr,stim and ultrasound variables were measured in mechanically ventilated (MV) patients <24 h after intubation (\"initiation of MV\", under assist-control ventilation, ACV) and at the time of switch to pressure-support ventilation (\"switch to PSV\"). Diaphragm dysfunction was defined as Ptr,stim <11 cmH 2 O. Results 112 patients were included. At initiation of MV, Ptr,stim was not correlated to Tdi (rho = \u22120\u00b713, p = 0\u00b728), EXdi (rho = 0\u00b710, p = 0\u00b766) or TFdi (rho = \u22120\u00b703, p = 0\u00b780). At switch to PSV, TFdi and EXdi were correlated to Ptr,stim, (rho = 0\u00b787, p < 0.001 and 0\u00b745, p = 0\u00b7001, respectively), but Tdi was not (rho = \u22120\u00b709, p = 0\u00b745). At switch to PSV, a TFdi <29% could reliably identify diaphragm dysfunction (sensitivity and specificity of 85 and 88%, respectively), but Tdi and EXdi could not. This value was associated with increased duration of ICU stay and MV, and mortality. Conclusion Under ACV, neither Tdi, EXdi nor TFdi were related to Ptr,stim. Under PSV, TFdi was strongly correlated to diaphragm strength and, when decreased, was associated with poorer outcome.",

Enteral nutrition (EN) is suspect to increase risk of gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance and intestinal ischemia. So, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is often preferred. The purpose of this study is to describe the nutrition practices for critically ill patients receiving ECLS and identify opportunities for improving nutrition therapy in this population. Patients and methods Retrospective analysis of patients requiring ECMO-VA or ECMO-VV between 2010 and 2014 in the cardiac surgery intensive care unit of the University Hospital of Nantes. Nutritional support was daily monitored with parenteral intake (glucose, lipid and propofol, protein and albumin, parenteral nutrition) and enteral nutrition until ECLS weaning. Two groups were compared during ECLS period: no enteral nutrition delivered (none or TPN) (ANEC, n = 73) and at least once enteral nutrition delivered (NEC, n = 50) including EN alone and supplemental parenteral nutrition (SPN). Primary outcome was incidence of GI intolerance and risk factors. Secondary outcomes were nutritional adequacy (calculated as overall of calories and protein delivered divided by the theoretical amount requirements: 20 kcal/kg/d and 1.2 g/kg/d) and clinical outcome. Data are reported as median (25th and 75th percentiles) or number (%), and analyzed with student's t test for continuous variables and \u03c72 test for categorical variables.

            "text": "None.Introduction Refeeding syndrome (RS) is a potentially lethal condition that remains underdiagnosed. It is characterized by severe electrolyte and fluid shifts associated with metabolic abnormalities in malnourished patients undergoing refeeding orally, enterally, or parenterally. Clinical criteria have been proposed for determination of its risk and reported in the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) Clinical Guidelines. Hypophosphoremia (hP) is a prominent feature of the RS and seems to be the earliest abnormality. Phosphorus is a vital component of nucleic acids, enzyme systems, and various metabolic pathways. Objective To determine the incidence of refeeding hypophosphoremia (RH) < 0.9 mmol/L, and severe RH < 0.6 mmol/L in a medical critical care unit. Patients and methods Monocentric, retrospective and observational study with patients from FRench-speAking icu Nutritional Survey study FRANS. Critically ill adults (more than 18 yo) were enrolled if they were hospitalized for more than 3 days during a 3-month period and had an artificial nutritional support. Refeeding hypophosphoremia is defined by the occurrence of hypophosphoremia after refeeding. We studied the incidence of HR, risk factors, and prognosis. Results 34 patients were enrolled between 03/01/2015 and 05/31/2015. RH appears in 73.5% and severe RH < 0.6 mmol/L in 35.3% (Fig. 28) . There is no correlation between RS risk factors and RH in our study. Logistic regression did not permit to identify neither risk factor nor prognostic modification. There is a lack in phosphoremia measuring (27.6%), and overfeeding during the first 3 days occurs in 29.4%. Discussion We define that an hypophosphoremia appearing after refeeding is a refeeding hypophosphoremia, and we do not consider others etiologies, such as mechanical ventilation, alkalosis, sepsis, alcoholism, malabsorptive states, poor intake, some medication. Our cohort is too small to find some possible correlations with risk factors or prognosis. Conclusion Refeeding hypophosphoremia is common in our population. Hypophosphoremia is not an independent predictor of ICU or in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients. The knowledge of the SRI requires the follow-up of the phosphoremia during nutrition after critical illness in particular in the undernourished patients.",

Introduction To determine the possible relationship between 10 days cumulated proteins (10 days CPD) and energy deficits (10 days CED) observed in ventilated patients and ICU length of stay, duration of ventilator support, incidence of infections and 28 days mortality. Patients and methods Mixed medical or surgical ventilated for at least 2 days adult patients from 5 ICUs from CHU Li\u00e8ge Belgium were enrolled into the study. They were fed by enteral route with a target of 25 kcal and 1.25 g of proteins by corrected kg of bodyweight and by day. If 50% of the target was not reached on day seven, parenteral nutrition was added with the same target. CED and CPD were calculated for 10 days, taking into account all the sources of nutrition, and was defined as the difference between the amount of energy or protein intake and the target. Results From 10/12/2014 till 30/5/2015, 99 patients were followed. Data from 62 patients could be cumulated on the first 10 days. There were 45 males, mean BMI was 26.9 \u00b1 6.3; SAPS II score on day 1 was 51.3 \u00b1 15.8, SOFA score at day 1 was 9.1 \u00b1 3.5. They were ventilated for a median of 18 days (IQR 13-26), median ICU length of stay was 27 days (IQR 19-35). Mean SOFA max calculated for the first 10 days was 12.1 \u00b1 4.2 and the 28 day mortality was 32.3%. On day 5, only 42% reached the target of 25 kcal/kg and 27% the target of 1.25 g of protein/kg. Mean 10 days CED was \u22125555.2 \u00b1 4639.9 kcal and mean 10 days CPD was \u2212350.8 \u00b1 252.3 g. There was a significant negative relationship between both deficits and the SOFA max (p = 0.0064 for CED and p = 0.0053 for CPD). However, there were no correlations between any of the deficits and ICU length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, occurrence of infections and 28 days mortality. Discussion Saps II level, SOFA max level, ICU length of stay, all these parameters emphasize the high severity of this cohort of patients. It could indeed been thought that it is in this group of critically ill patients that the impact of nutrition could be easily demonstrated. Clear relationships between SOFAmax on day 10 and the 10 days CED and CPD could be seen. However, both the deficit and the level of organ dysfunctions could be cause or consequence. Unlike previous studies, usually performed in less severely ill patients, we did not find any relationship between CED or CPD and patient's outcome. Conclusion Contrary to some recent studies, we found no relationship between CED and CPE and outcome of patients. Future studies are needed.",

Hence, several studies in critically ill cancer patients failed to demonstrate the impact of neutropenia on outcome [1] . This lack of statistical association might however, reflect a lack of statistical power. A previous meta-analysis of aggregated data suggested 11% (95% CI 9-14%) raw increase in mortality in neutropenic patients. The available data were, however insufficient to allow adjustment with confounders [2] . The aim of this study was to assess the influence of neutropenia on mortality of critically ill cancer patients using individual data obtained from studies identified by our systematic review. Secondary objectives were to assess the influence of neutropenia on mortality of critically ill patients while taking into account underlying malignancy, use of G-CSF or changes related to period of admission. Patients and methods This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA statements. Public-domain databases including PubMed and the Cochrane database were searched by using predefined keywords. The research was restricted to articles published in English and studies focusing on critically ill adult patients from May 2005 to May 2015. The methods and objectives of this systematic review were reported in the PROSPERO database (CRD42015026347). Selected manuscripts' authors were then contacted to obtained part of their dataset. Mortality was defined as either hospital or day-28 mortality. This preliminary analysis reports results from the whole dataset before and after adjustment using logistic regression. Period of admission and use of G-CSF were then assessed and were a pre-planned analysis. Results Our initial search yielded 1528 citations and 131 studies were retained for further analysis. Overall, 9 studies were excluded for redundancy with other included studies, 5 as containing only neutropenic patients, and two as containing only palliative patients. Finally 30 datasets (26%) containing sufficient data to allow comparison were obtained from authors. Overall, 7356 patients were included in this study, including 1666 patients with neutropenia at ICU admission. Median age was of 60 years (IQR 49-69). Median SAPSII score at ICU admission was 42 (IQR 28-57).

Initial serum PCT and when available at day 3 and day 5 were recorded. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Serum PCT was considered as decreasing when the decrease was \u226525% at day 3 and/or \u226550% at day 5. Mortality rates in the ICU and at day-90 were also studied. Results Fifty-four patients were included in the study. At diagnosis, PCT levels were significantly different between the \"Infection disease\" group and the \"No infection disease\" group (p = 0.002). There was no difference between the \"Infection disease\" group and the \"Unknown\" group (p = 0.052). For the diagnosis of bacterial infection, best initial serum PCT threshold was 0.65 ng per milliliter. For that threshold, sensitivity was 94.6% and specificity was 78.6%. PCT area under the ROC curve was 0.93 [CI 95% = 0.855-1]. Youden's J statistic was 0.73. PCT levels weren't different between groups according to the presence of neutropenia or in case of inaugural disease. There was a significant difference in PCT values between groups according to the SOFA score (p = 0.027), but not the SAPS2 score. Mortality rate in the ICU and at day-90 were significantly lower for the patients with decreasing PCT (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). When comparing serum PCT and CRP predictive values, PCT was significantly a better marker of bacterial infection (Fig. 30 ). Discussion We found that serum PCT, with a threshold of 0.66 ng/ mL, is a reliable marker of bacterial infection disease in patients with aggressive hematological malignancy admitted to the ICU. Our study confirms the results of a previous study in unselected immunocompromised patients admitted to the ICU, showing a 100% sensitivity, a 63% specificity and an area under ROC curve of 0.851 [0.78-0.92] for a threshold of 0.5 ng/mL (1).

CCI is a iatrogenic process, reflecting the efficacy of modern life support technologies(1), and encompasses multiple organ failure, need for prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV), organ support, and palsy due to polineuromyopathy. The transition from acute to CCI is gradual: definitions are based on duration of MV, with cut-offs of 7, 14 or 21 consecutive days of MV for \u22656 h/day. CCI patients may come from either medical or surgical ICU; their health status fluctuates between improvements and deteriorations implying recurrent transitions between different levels of care (1) .The risk of death is reported to be as high as 50%. Despite a relatively young age (65 years on average), functional status of CCI patients discharged is seriously impaired, thus CCI patients require long-term rehabilitation. AIM: To estimate the frequency of CCI Syndrome in Careggi, a large academic, tertiary care hospital; to describe the clinical course of CCI patients through discharge, and their functional status at discharge. Patients and methods Administrative data on admission, transfer, death and discharge of all CCI patients, consecutively admitted in one of the 56 ICU beds at Careggi Hospital from January 1 to December 31, 2014, were collected. CCI was defined with the cut off of \u226521 days of ICU stay, representing the index event (IE) without contribution of previous or subsequent hospitalization in other hospitals. Reasons for admission were grouped into the 4 broad categories of medical causes, surgery, major trauma and cardio-respiratory arrest. Patients discharged were evaluated in daily living, cognitive status, and mobility using Barthel Index. Results We identified 123 subjects who developed CCI (71 males; age 61.7 \u00b1 1.5 years, mean \u00b1 SEM); 36 of them came from an external ICU, 87 began their CCI course within Careggi hospital (60 from the Emergency Room, 27 from a regular ward). Average duration of the IE was 36.1 \u00b1 2.1 days. These sample developed accumulative length of ICU stay of 4440 days, corresponding to a 22% ICU bed occupation over the theoretical total of 20,440. When days of subintensive care and regular ward were separately added, 5500 days of highly specialized care and 6266 days of total acute hospital stay were reached. Surgical patients had longer hospitalizations (p = 0.009).CCI patients confirmed to be highly erratic: a total of 302 transitions across different services were recorded in the 123 patients, with a maximum of 9 in 6 of them. Mean age was comparable between the 27 patients who died (22%) and the remaining 95 who were discharged alive (66.9 \u00b1 2.5 vs. 60.3 \u00b1 1.7 years; p = 0.058).Fourteen subjects continued their ICU stay out of hospital. Only 6, whose age was lower (37.7 \u00b1 3.7 years), were discharged home; half of the participants (n = 68, 55.2%) were admitted to a residential rehabilitation facility. Younger subjects scored better in the domains of self care (p = 0.018) and cognitive status (p = 0.008) but not in the domain of mobility, including walking ability: 45 patients required maximal assistance in performing activities of daily living and transfers, other 12 required medium/maximal assistance, with no statistical difference between DG group. Conclusion CCI is a relevant clinical condition that need to be assessed and possibly prevented, as it causes severe morbidity, long-term functional impairment and exceeding healthcare costs.",

            "text": "None.Introduction Patients with high flow nasal cannula may benefit from combined aerosol therapy. Clinical efficacy depends on pulmonary deposition which is related to the type of nebulizer. All new nebulizers or delivery methods require rigorous evaluation. The aim of this study was to compare lung deposition between two nebulizers (jet nebulizer vs vibrating-mesh nebulizer) through high flow nasal cannula in healthy subjects. Patients and methods Aerosol delivery of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid labelled with technetium-99m (99mTc-DTPA, 4 mCi/4 mL) to the lungs using a vibrating-mesh nebulizer (Aerogen Solo \u00ae , Aerogen Ltd., Galway, Ireland) and a constant-output jet nebulizer (Opti-Mist Plus Nebulizer \u00ae , ConvaTec, Bridgewater, NJ) through high flow nasal cannula (Optiflow \u00ae , Fisher & Paykel, New Zealand) was compared in 6 healthy subjects. Flow rate was set at 30 L/min through the heated humidified circuit. Pulmonary and extrapulmonary deposition were measured by single photon emission computed tomography combined with a low dose CT-scan (SPECT-CT) and by planar scintigraphy. Results Lung deposition was only 3.3 \u00b1 1.3 and 1.2 \u00b1 0.8% of the nominal dose with the vibrating-mesh nebulizer and the jet nebulizer, respectively (p < 0.05). Dose lost in the high flow circuit, humidification chamber and nasal cannula was higher with the vibrating-mesh nebulizer as compared to the jet nebulizer (75.2 \u00b1 8.2 vs 45.0 \u00b1 6.2% of the nominal dose, p = 0.001). Expressed as percentage of emitted dose, lung deposition was similar with both nebulizers. Conclusion This study demonstrated that aerosol delivery through HFNC is poor in the specific conditions of the study despite the higher efficiency of the vibrating-mesh nebulizer as compared to the jet nebulizer. Placing the nebulizer on the HFNC circuit at 30 L/min induces high aerosol loss on the circuit and the oropharynx. ",
