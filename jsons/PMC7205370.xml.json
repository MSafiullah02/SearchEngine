            "text": "On April 4, 2020, the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China instituted a nationwide day of remembrance for the over 3300 patients, nurses, and doctors\u2014who have perished (within China) as a result of the global viral pandemic known as Covid-19 (Collier 2020). As the virus begins to subside, and the government readies the dismantling of its \u2018lockdown\u2019 brand of aggressive social distancing, this display of collective mourning represents a moment of somber reflection\u2014not only in grief for recently departed loved ones, but also in respect to the many fallen heroes\u2014\u2018martyrs\u2019 who in sacrificing everything helped contain the spread of Covid-19 to its epicenter in Wuhan (Connelly 2020). However, while new studies are highlighting how China was able to successfully \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 (Lee 2020), many countries, like the USA, Italy, and Spain, continue to suffer tremendous losses as their governments fail to act decisively under the full weight of Covid-19 (Trofimov 2020; Peters et al. 2020b). While China has gone to great lengths to fill the gap in leadership left by the US\u2019 retreat into an \u2018America First\u2019 foreign policy (The White House 2018) marked by protectionism, anti-globalism, and national populism (Miller-Idriss 2019; Peters 2019a), it has also allowed itself to get caught-up in a battle of disinformation with the USA going tit-for-tat with the Trump administration\u2019s \u2018alternative-facts-based\u2019 propaganda machine (Finnegan 2020). This unsightly bickering has unfortunately allowed Trump\u2019s brand of anti-globalist post-truth populism to hold sway over the inclusive cosmopolitan aims of Chinese internationalism (Green 2020a, b).",

Specifically, it remains unclear whether the current climate of global risk-cum-openness and co(labor)ation can transform the prevailing Kantian flat universalism towards an ethos of community. In the following excerpt, Peters weighs the perils of essentializing universalism against the need for a social ontology based in global ethics:In every case that purports a universalism, we must subject it to severe intellectual tests and make sure that it is not simply the cultural projection of the dominant power. This is an ethical and political obligation of all thinkers, especially those of the \u2018imperial\u2019 west. On the other hand, I am interested in the evolutionary rationality that develops as a form of globalism which moves us closer to a set of values that might provide a global ethics of the environment and of the other (Peters and Jandri\u0107 2018a: 271).Thusly, this article outlines a framework for the critical social ontology\u2014ethos of community, which according to Peters (2020a, b)\u2014is needed to unite the global community in the fight against Covid-19.",

This ethical imperative turned \u2018moral opportunity\u2019 may be highlighted by China\u2019s current mobilization around the fight against Covid-19. In its development of a heretofore unprecedented form of \u2018risk community/cosmopolitan solidarity\u2019 (Beck 2013), China has effectively seized the moral opportunity provided by the current moment of crisis-cum-openness as highlighted by Beck and Grande (2010). Specifically, China has contributed both material resources such as testing kits, masks, monetary donations, and medical personnel (Moritsugu 2020; Kuo 2020), as well as cognitive resources such as open-source scientific research relating to testing, prevention, and the development of a Covid-19 vaccine (Peters et al. 2020). However, these efforts have been labeled by some as merely an attempt by China to make up for a \u2018botched initial response\u2019\u2014the censorship of doctors, which made the spread far worse than it might have been (Fuchs 2020). While this critique may very well hold water, the USA and China both have been spreading unfounded conspiracy theories as part of a \u2018weaponization\u2019 (Peters et al. 2020) of Covid-19 for political ends\u2014resulting in a climate of anti-Chinese racism and xenophobia in the US and an increased anti-foreign nationalist sentiment in China (Fuchs 2020; Kuo and Davidson 2020).",

Moreover, the concept of \u2018the postdigital\u2019 reflects a contemporary human relationship to a digital paradigm that has lost its early sheen of openness, democracy and user-friendliness to a haze of bias, discrimination and inequality (Jandri\u0107 et al. 2018). Notwithstanding, in the postdigital age, this problematic notion of crowd wisdom may still yet warrant a hopeful association with the notion of collective intelligence. Specifically, this hopefulness is rooted to an understanding that technology has created new networks of research, sharing, and collaboration, based in the logic that solutions to global problems are better solved through the democratic engagement of people who are well-informed and therefore less-biased in their collective group-thought (Peters and Jandri\u0107 2018b).",

These instances of competition are clearly witnessed within the USA and China\u2019s continued jockeying over global leadership positioning. Moreover, as the global death toll continues to rise, the USA and China compete over who has contributed more to the global fight against Covid-19, who is the more responsible leader, and finally, who represents the better \u2018partner\u2019 in the global response to Covid-19 (Finnegan 2020). Embedded within this digital \u2018clash of civilizations\u2019 discourse, played out over tweets by government officials who claim \u2018#truth\u2019 as they retweet unverifiable conspiracy theories to the masses (Mu 2020), lies the very analog desire to cement the boundaries between us and them. This belies the notion that as technology and globalization continue to transnationalize and deterritorialize our increasingly mobile identities, social, cultural, and political identities continue to represent retrenched forms of group identity that separate us from them (Delanty 2006a; Green 2020a, b, forthcoming 2020c).",

This notion is brought home by the recent declaration by US Senator Martha McSally, who in a pantomime of 1950\u2019s red scare McCarthyism, readily evoked the specter of communism when referring to official Chinese health experts. Specifically, when questioned by Fox News regarding China\u2019s release of official Covid-19 figures, the Senator stated, \u2018I never trusted a Communist\u2019 (Calicchio 2020). Once again, within the postdigital framework of Peters\u2019 (2020a, b) ethos of community, this viral pandemic represents a \u2018moral opportunity\u2019 for people to find themselves within the struggle and sacrifice for the greater good. However, this pandemic has also highlighted the mortal dangers inherent to a form of decentralized, non-hierarchical, and peer-governed \u2018digital socialism\u2019 (peer production, collective intelligence) which has enabled and contributed to the legitimation of racist/xenophobic discourses and narratives created within the current era of post-truth populism (Burke and Carolissen 2018; Peters 2020b). Post-truth populism can be best described as follows:So (sic) post-truth populism is a form of authoritarian politics in which \u2018folksy or fiery leaders\u2019 make appeals to emotion and personal belief, eschewing objective fact, all in the name of \u2018ordinary people\u2019. In concert with racism and xenophobia, it is often used to gin up fear and hatred of the racialized \u2018other\u2019 (Burke and Carolissen 2018).The political economy of viral modernity, which allowed Trump\u2019s victory in 2016, a victory of mendacity over veritas, values consumerism over empirical evidence while utilizing a logic that is concerned primarily with emotionally charged group-think rather than a traditional concern for ethics (Besley et al. 2018). Moreover, Mumford highlights how the continued progress of technology represents a dialectic process of democratic/authoritarian interaction which prompts users and social groups to innovate both \u2018democratic technics\u2019\u2014as digital openness and collaboration, as well as \u2018authoritarian technics\u2019\u2014as the pursuzt of social, political, and economic authority (May 2008). While democratic technics have the potential to democratize the postdigital economy, by enabling new forms of technological openness, institutions and governments have increasingly utilized authoritarian technics to surveil, propagandize and suppress free speech (Peters 2020a, b).",

However, while China and its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) remain on the forefront of cosmopolitan hospitality (Green 2020a, b, forthcoming 2020c), its utilization of authoritarian technics, i.e., digital authoritarianism, as a means of surveillance, censorship and political repression, has quickly become a model for the non-democratic world (Feldstein 2020).

Communitarians have argued that the notion of a Kantian ethical community represents nothing more than an atomistic, ethicized \u2018aloof harmony of separate individual wills \u2026abstracted from human society\u2019 (Moore 1992). While this may be the case, Moore (1992) believes that a less pessimistic interpretation of Kant\u2019s kingdom of ends highlights a notion of the ethical community as replete with idealized postulates such as unity, harmony, communal intention, interest in other members, internal bonds, reciprocity, and communal identity. Moreover, these ethical postulates represent a moral task or obligation towards action\u2014positioning the ethical community as a legitimate object of human hope and striving (Moore 1992). In searching for an ethical universalism founded in both a community of inquiry and ethic of criticism, Peters (2013) outlines a critical social ontology which is able to both diagnose the pathologies of modern society while illuminating and enhancing a common interest based in co(labor)ative/collective-intentional ends\u2014a mutual freedom from the reification of cognitive capitalism\u2019s power/domination-based hierarchical ends (Thompson 2017).",

(Giroux 2018)Giroux\u2019s argument rests in the positioning of education as a democratic sphere for the development of discourses and pedagogical practices to enhance the capacities of critical, knowledgeable, and informed young people as agents of hope and possibility (Giroux 2018). Within the postdigital climate of ideologically bounded and increasingly retrenched forms of identity politics, education stands as a means for the creation of critical communities of ethical criticism. In other words, an education founded in a community of ethical critique provides a framework for a system of postdigital collective education.",

            "text": "Within Peters\u2019 search for a theory of viral post-truth ethical universalism, conceptualized by the ethos of community framework, lies the notion of radical openness \u2018a state of mind which entails a willingness to surrender preconceptions of how the world should be in order to adapt to an ever-changing environment\u2019 (Codd and Craighead 2018). Inherent to this notion of radical openness is the understanding that the prerequisite for a healthy world necessitates the formulation of an ethos of community built upon empathy (Peters 2020a, b). The empathy inherent to radical openness is also present within the notion of cosmopolitan empathy, wherein the practice of \u2018exclusive differentiation is cast aside in favor a \u2018logic of inclusive oppositions\u2019\u2019\u2014a cosmopolitan vision which extends our capacity to perceive, in a more sensitive way, the lives of others as both different from our own yet equally fated together within the crises of second modernity (Beck 2006; Beck and Grande 2010; Bielsa and Hermans 2016). Furthermore, central to the notion of empathy is the concept of \u2018shared feelings\u2019 as a challenge to epistemological individualism, reflected by Schmid\u2019s central claim that plural self-awareness can clarify a sense of us into an understanding of ours\u2014an experiential fusion of the plural self (Zahavi 2018). Schmid\u2019s phenomenal fusion of shared experience/consciousness allows for interpersonal difference, though not between subjects, but rather as different parts of a unified whole (Zahavi 2018). The individually felt yet collectively experienced phenomenon of \u2018shared feeling\u2019 is further elaborated within this excerpt:In the case of shared feelings\u2014shared grief, worries, and joys\u2014there is a sense in which it is simply not the case that \u2018I can\u2019t really know how you feel\u2019, because my feeling is your feeling, or rather: my feeling isn\u2019t really mine, and yours isn\u2019t yours, but ours. Shared feelings are conscious experiences whose subjective aspect is not singular (\u2018for me\u2019), but plural (\u2018for us\u2019): it is plural self-awareness of a shared affective concern (Schmid 2014).Finally, as reflected by the title of his latest work, \u2018Love and social distancing in the time of Covid-19\u2019 (Peters 2020b), it is clear that Peters\u2019 ethos of community connotes a radical openness of self that reflects not just cognitive understanding or emotional empathy but a concern for the Kantian notion of love and respect as the foundational moral laws which govern humanity (Wagoner 1997). For Peters (2020b), individualistic acts of selfishness and competitiveness, i.e., trips to the beach, and the hoarding of toilet paper, etc., represent an irrational form of romantic \u2018lovesickness.\u2019 In lieu of the fleeting pleasures inherent to selfish acts of romantic love, individual sacrifice and collective rationality (exhibited by those who practice social distancing and hand washing) represents a practice of moral love based in virtuous filial dedication to those 70+ who are most at risk (Peters 2020a, b). This form of sacrificial moral love highlights man\u2019s ability to rise above himself for the benefit of the collective good, highlighting how love and respect can affect a harmonious symbiosis between the self and other as us. Lastly, the concept of mutual love and respect inherent to radical openness within an ethos of community can be expressed as follows: \u2018These two concerns\u2014for self and other\u2014are not competing; in fact, they are intertwined harmoniously. Our individual progress benefits the world and others, and our care for the world and others opens our own minds and hearts.\u2019 (Kongtrul 2018: 2).",

Within a knowledge cultures founded in a sociopolitical economy of knowledge socialism, the value of knowledge lies both in its relation to the greater good, as well as its ability to create far-reaching benefits for both producer and consumer (Peters 2019b). Within this framework, the ethos of community is reflected by a harmonized relationship between the self and other. The ethos of community reflects an alternative rationalization of progress within overlapping and intimately fated cosmopolitan modernities, where global risk communities promote a form of postdigital education grounded in the constant search for democratic, ethical, and self-reflexive collective intelligence towards securing the greater good.",
