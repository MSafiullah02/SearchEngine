By 28 contrast, in the field of functional urology, given the absence 29 of a formalised concept of disease-related \"prognosis\", 30 clear-cut decisions are more difficult to make. This area 31 covers a wide spectrum of clinical situations, sometimes 32 viewed as purely benign conditions or quality-of-life issues. 33 While widespread postponement of such cases is a safe 34 decision during the initial dramatic surge of the pandemic, 35 the reality is more complex. In the short term, recommen-36 dations for surgery and routine care probably need to be 37 amended with specific guidance to maintain the level of 38 care and satisfy patient needs. \"Rescheduling\" cannot be the 39 universal answer to this upcoming challenge. Before an 40 evidence-based rationale becomes available to modify our 41 approaches for benign urological diseases, our community 42 will have to rely on common sense to sort out specific 43 emergencies, smartly adapt their practice to a continuously 44 changing situation, and anticipate the future. 45 For nonurgent situations, office visits should be replaced 46 by telemedicine, via either video or telephone consultation 47 [6] (for patients aged >70 yr or unable to connect and 48 patients with chronic diseases); in France, these consulta-49 tions are fully reimbursed by the national health insurance 50 scheme. Medical options for lower urinary tract symptoms 51 must be systematically considered and/or optimised with 52 appropriate patient information. Self-administered trans-53 cutaneous tibial nerve stimulation is preferable to the 54 percutaneous approach if available. Pelvic-floor muscle 55 training should be postponed to respect social distancing 56 and confinement; coping, education, and motivation 57 programmes should be encouraged. 58 Planned surgical procedures for relief of benign prostatic 59 obstruction can be postponed. In the case of acute urinary 60 retention or severe/complicated obstruction, a urethral or 61 suprapubic catheter can be placed and changed regularly in 62 the community setting. Intermittent catheterisation should 63 be systematically considered if education remains possible. 64 In selected cases, office-based endoscopic techniques 65 performed under local anaesthetic (Urolift, Rezum, I-Tind) 66 may also be discussed as alternative options.",

Urologists should 69 therefore screen their patient list to check for \"red flags\" 70 requiring rapid appropriate investigations such as endos-71 copy. Surgical management using botulinum toxin A 72 injection (BTX-A) or sacral nerve stimulation should be are challenging cases not only 83 because of the therapeutic setting but also because of their 84 potential susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. While 85 neurogenic bladder itself has not yet been identified as a 86 risk factor for COVID-19 infection, the numerous comorbid-87 ities (especially cardiac and pulmonary diseases) associated 88 with neurological diseases make these patients de facto at 89 risk of complications. Moreover, systemic therapies (eg, for 90 treatment of multiple sclerosis) may mean that these 91 patients are even more vulnerable. 92 From a urological point of view, the aim of neurogenic 93 bladder management is to prevent renal failure and 94 infections. Some high-risk situations have been identified, 95 including maximum detrusor pressure >30 cm H 2 O, blad-96 der compliance <15 ml/cm H 2 O, autonomic dysreflexia, 97 recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and recent changes 98 in the upper urinary tract [7]. In these cases it may be 99 advisable to maintain intradetrusor BTX-A injections as 100 scheduled, under local anaesthesia if possible. 101 Major reconstructive surgeries, including augmentation 102 cystoplasty, cystectomy, and continent and incontinent 103 diversions, are being postponed because they require 104 intensive postoperative care. However, some situations 105 warrant a discussion about balancing the risks and benefits, 106 especially in the case of threatening infectious lesions (eg, 107 ongoing complicated perineal infections, urethrocutaneous 108 fistulae complicating a sacroperineal pressure ulcer, sym-109 physitis, recurrent severe UTIs). These conditions, although 110 rare, require surgical management without delay in a frail 111 population to avoid severe complications or death [8]. The 112 essential step in treatment is to dry the perineum by 113 performing a noncontinent urinary diversion. Concomitant 114 cystectomy may be delayed to minimise surgical morbidity 115 and avoid any need for intensive care.116 Finally, multidisciplinary meetings should be held using 117 virtual meeting software and teleconferences to avoid 118 overwhelming situations after confinement, especially in 119",

Therefore, we have to carefully monitor 124 patients to provide the usual standard of care for their 125 conditions after resolution of the crisis. It is essential to 126 maintain traceability for all information exchanged on 127 patients during the whole period and make this available for 128 future analyses of possible direct or indirect consequences. 129 To face the post-epidemic phase, which is predicted to last 130 for a few months after confinement, we have to anticipate 131 ways in which to progressively resume our activities to 132 avoid overwhelming the system with complicated cases, 133 rescheduled procedures, and new patients. In this reflec-134 tion, the outpatient setting may provide unique solutions in 135 the care pathway.
