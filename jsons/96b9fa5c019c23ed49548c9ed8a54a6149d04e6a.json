These flexible recommendations allow surgical residency programs the opportunity to maintain a rigorous educational experience despite the limitations imposed by COVID-19. As our surgical field unites to face this crisis, we are presented with a golden opportunity to embrace systemic change by developing and delivering collaborative educational content, forever leaving behind the limitations imposed by institutional silos.",

Prior studies in dual-coding learning theory have demonstrated when educational content is presented to both pathways concurrently, as in VBE, learners have a higher likelihood of recall. 4 This platform is particularly useful for operative case preparation, especially in the setting of a pandemic where limited surgical cases are proceeding. While individual residency programs may choose to create their own VBE modules, this is often labor intensive, cost prohibitive, and can feel daunting. Instead, pre-existing operative video libraries could be utilized to supplement resident education. Two examples of peerreviewed libraries with VBE operative content include the Journal of Medical Insight (JOMI) and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Online Video Library.

For lectures delivered through an online platform, it is important to select clearly defined learning objectives for each session as opposed to covering vast amounts of material during the designated session.
