They demonstrate that the clone, 3I14, can successfully bind and neutralize both group 1 and 2 influenza viruses by binding in the HA stem region and preventing maturation of the HA molecule. This antibody improved survival and reduced weight loss in mice infected with H7N7, H7N9, H3N2 and H5N1 virus subtypes. An in-vitro reporter assay suggests that 3I14 can interact with Fcgamma receptor IIIa and activate FcR-bearing reporter cells in the presence of \"target\" cells expressing HA. This is consistent with a potential role for 3I14 in mediating ADCC, which has been suggested to be the mechanism by which influenza bnAbs provide protection in vivo. The investigators show through sequencing of BCRs from the cloned memory B cells and germline cells that the heavy chain of the 3I14 antibody is encoded by IGHV3-30, that the CDR3 region includes a relatively long loop, and that the antibody has undergone an intermediate level of somatic mutation that involves both heavy and light chains. Finally, they use crystal structures of HA with modeled 3I14 to show that binding of HA likely involves both the heavy and light chains. Structural analysis also allows the investigators to predict residues that would increase H5N1 binding; indeed, they show that altering these residues results in an increase in binding affinity to H5N1 HAs. This is a comprehensive study of a novel bnAb derived from memory B cells and provides important insights into the mechanisms by which bnAbs against influenza can be generated in vivo. Interestingly, the sequence analysis show that H5 HA binding was likely acquired during somatic hypermutation, underscoring the important role of this process in driving bnAb ontogeny.",

How do the authors explain that an antibody targeting an epitope \"shared\" with previously described broadly neutralizing antibodies behaves so poorly? \u2022 The authors claim that mAb 3I14 mediates Fc-dependent viral clearance, but fail to provide compelling data to support this hypothesis. Firstly, there is no evidence that mAb 3I14 allows for virus clearance. Lung titers should be assessed to prove that administration of this mAb lowers virus titers. Secondly, ADCC is only one mechanism of Fc-dependent engagement. The authors should include a positive control (CR9114, etc) in this assay and provide fold-induction results for the Promega kit, as described by the manufacturer. If the authors want to clearly prove that this mAb relies on Fc-dependent viral clearance, they should clone the variable regions into a mouse IgG2a backbone and a mouse IgG2a D265A backbones (Dillilo et al. 2012). This would allow for the direct comparison of a functional Fc region and a dysfunctional Fc region (abrogates Fc engagement). \u2022 The methodology for reverting back to germline needs to be described in more detail. Sup. Fig. 2 shows that 3I14 GL is based on VH3-30*18, IGHD3-22*01 and IGHJ4*02. However, R108S, F109G, V110Y, W111Y and V112Y are not included in 3I14 GL. This needs to be addressed.
