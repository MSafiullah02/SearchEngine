During starvation-induced autophagy, cytoplasm is nonselectively engulfed into double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes), whose content is digested upon fusion with lysosomes. This process has been adapted for host defense, where invading pathogens are selectively targeted by autophagy (Deretic, 2012; Levine et al., 2011; Randow et al., 2013). Selective antimicrobial autophagy relies on cargo receptors that simultaneously detect pathogen-associated \u201ceat me\u201d signals and bind to members of the ATG8/LC3 family of ubiquitin-related proteins residing on autophagosomal membranes (Boyle and Randow, 2013; Thurston et al., 2009; 2012; Wild et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2009). Binding partners of LC3/ATG8 family members typically contain an LC3-interacting region (LIR). LIRs form intermolecular \u03b2 sheets with LC3/ATG8 family members by virtue of a consensus W/FxxI/L motif, often preceded by acidic residues (Johansen and Lamark, 2011).",

In addition, viral proteins subvert host physiology by encoding short linear motifs (SLiMs) that mimic host protein interaction interfaces, but which require little coding capacity (Davey et al., 2011).

M2 is a tetrameric integral membrane protein, made from a spliced transcript (Holsinger et al., 1994; Lamb et al., 1985). M2 comprises a 25 amino acid N-terminal ectodomain, a transmembrane \u03b1 helix and a 50 amino acid cytoplasmic domain. This cytoplasmic tail contains a membrane-proximal amphipathic \u03b1 helix and a membrane-distal region of unknown structure (Schnell and Chou, 2008; Sharma et al., 2010; Stouffer et al., 2008). M2 has multiple important roles in the virus life cycle. During viral entry its ion channel activity is required to trigger disassembly in response to lowered endosomal pH, and its cytoplasmic tail contributes to virus assembly, budding, and morphogenesis (Rossman and Lamb, 2011).",

Human cell lines, stably transduced with GFP-LC3, were infected with IAV strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (Figure 1A and Figure S1 available online). In uninfected cells, GFP-LC3 was distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm. Following infection, LC3 accumulated in the perinuclear region, as previously described (Gannag\u00e9 et al., 2009). In addition, GFP-LC3 strikingly relocalized to the cell periphery. To investigate the subcellular localization of LC3 in infected cells, we stained nonpermeabilized cells with wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA) to label extracellular glycans. In uninfected cells, there was little colocalization of GFP-LC3 and WGA, while in infected cells GFP-LC3 and WGA colocalized at the plasma membrane, but not on perinuclear autophagosomes (Figure 1B). To verify the presence of LC3 at the plasma membrane and examine the subcellular distribution of autophagosomes in IAV-infected cells, we performed immunoelectron microscopy (Kabeya et al., 2000). As expected, in both mock and IAV-infected cells, LC3 was present in double-membrane vesicles corresponding to autophagosomes (Figure 1C). Infected but not uninfected cells also demonstrated staining of the plasma membrane, both at sites of active viral budding and in areas where less budding was taking place (Figure 1C). LC3 G120A, a mutant that cannot be lipidated, did not localize to autophagosomes or the plasma membrane. Taken together, these data demonstrate that IAV directs LC3 to the plasma membrane, an unusual and unexpected destination.",

In contrast to wild-type (WT) IAV, infection with a virus deficient in M2 (V7-T9; named here \u0394M2) due to mutation of the M2 splice donor site (Hutchinson et al., 2008; Wise et al., 2012) did not relocalize LC3 to the plasma membrane or induce its perinuclear accumulation (Figure 2B).

To identify potential LIRs in M2, we used JPRED to predict secondary structures in its cytosolic tail. One \u03b1-helix and one \u03b2 strand were predicted (Figure 3A). The predicted \u03b2 strand contains a FVSI motif that matches the consensus LIR motif (Johansen and Lamark, 2011). Among biochemically proven LIR motifs, the M2 FVSI motif most closely corresponds to those found in optineurin and ATG13, which both contain FVxI as their hydrophobic core (Alemu et al., 2012; Wild et al., 2011) (Figure 3B). Preceding the putative M2 LIR motif are three acidic residues, another typical feature of LC3/ATG8 binding proteins.",

WT M2 and the naturally occurring variant S93N bound LC3, whereas M2\u0394LIR, M2 F91S, M2 V92S, and M2 I94S failed to bind (Figure 3D). M2 and the LIR-containing p62 compete for binding to LC3, indicating that M2 binds the same site as the classical p62 LIR (Figure S2A). To determine the monomeric binding affinity of the interaction, a fluorescently labeled peptide corresponding to the last 13 amino acids of M2 and purified LC3 protein were used in fluorescence anisotropy equilibrium measurements. A dissociation constant (KD) of 9.5 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcM was determined (Figure 3E). In vivo this interaction would be enhanced by the tetrameric nature of M2, and reduced dimensionality imposed by the presence of both proteins in membranes. To test whether M2 bound LC3 in vivo in a LIR-dependent manner, we performed GFP-trap pull-down experiments in GFP-LC3-expressing cells infected with WT, \u0394M2, or M2 F91S IAV. WT M2, but not the M2 LIR mutant F91S, coprecipitated with LC3 (Figure 3F). We conclude that the M2 cytosolic tail contains a conserved LIR motif capable of directly interacting with LC3 in infected cells.",

Both phenomena depended on M2. However, plasma membrane relocalization of LC3 occurred efficiently only in cells infected with viruses encoding functional M2 LIR motifs (WT or M2 S93N), but not in those infected with viruses encoding LIR motifs unable to bind LC3 (M2 F91S and I94S) (Figure 3H). This phenomenon was not due to a delay in replication of mutant viruses (Figure S2C). In contrast, the proportion of cells accumulating perinuclear autophagosomes was not significantly different between WT and LIR mutants (Figure 3I). LC3 unable to become lipidated (LC3 G120A) did not redistribute to either the perinuclear region or plasma membrane in IAV-infected cells (Figures 3H and 3I). Thus, while IAV M2 causes both the accumulation of autophagosomes and the relocalization of LC3 to the plasma membrane, these functions are separable, since the M2 LIR motif is required for the relocalization of LC3 to the plasma membrane, but not its perinuclear accumulation.",

IAV can bud in both a spherical and a filamentous fashion, depending on the genetic background of the virus and the host-cell type (Bourmakina and Garc\u00eda-Sastre, 2003; Elleman and Barclay, 2004; Roberts and Compans, 1998). Most human-pathogenic isolates of IAV form up to 10 \u03bcm long filamentous particles that require extensive membrane resources. Since M2 influences filament formation (Iwatsuki-Horimoto et al., 2006; Roberts and Compans, 1998; Rossman et al., 2010), we hypothesized that accumulation of LC3 at the plasma membrane might represent the virus mobilizing lipid resources for budding. Accordingly, we introduced the M2 LIR mutations into a filamentous strain of IAV, PR8-MUd (Noton et al., 2007). PR8-MUd produces a profusion of micrometer-length filaments arrayed in parallel bundles. While the M2 S93N LIR variant resembled WT virus, cells infected with the M2 F91S or I94S virus encoding nonfunctional LIRs produced fewer filaments with a lower tendency to form bundles (Figure 4A). Confocal microscopy, which biases toward detection of long filament bundles (Simpson-Holley et al., 2002), revealed a large difference in the propensity of cells infected with WT or F91S PR8 MUd to project filament bundles away from the cell surface (Figure 4B). Consistent with a role for autophagy in filamentous budding, both depletion of ATG16L1 and LIR motif mutation reduced the formation of filament bundles (Figure S4). We conclude that the M2 LIR motif is required for normal filamentous budding of IAV.",

This LIR is required for the generation of stable virions, which correlates with the M2 LIR-dependent recruitment of the autophagosomal marker LC3 to the plasma membrane of infected cells. In contrast, the M2 LIR is not required for the induction of autophagy per se, since viruses bearing a mutant M2 LIR enhanced the proportion of lipidated LC3 in infected cells similar to WT IAV. In contrast, viruses lacking M2 scarcely stimulated LC3-II accumulation. We therefore propose a model whereby M2 subverts autophagy by two different means: (1) via a LIR-independent mechanism that, in accordance with a previous report (Gannag\u00e9 et al., 2009), is not dependent on the M2 cytosolic domain containing the LIR motif, and (2) via the LIR motif identified here, which redirects LC3 to the plasma membrane. The two activities may not be independent, since M2 may stimulate autophagy via beclin-1 (Gannag\u00e9 et al., 2010) and utilize its LIR motif to transport lipids to the plasma membrane. This mobilization of resources via the autophagy machinery may be important to prevent the depletion of the plasma membrane due to budding virus particles.",

Although the plasma membrane can contribute to autophagosome biogenesis (Ravikumar et al., 2010), this occurs early in the process and is therefore unlikely to correspond to the IAV-mediated recruitment of LC3 to the plasma membrane reported here. Two distinct mechanisms might target LC3 to the plasma membrane: LC3 may become directly conjugated to the plasma membrane, a scenario that can be demonstrated experimentally but for which no physiological equivalent is known (Fujita et al., 2008), or it may occur by the union of LC3-positive vesicles with the plasma membrane. The only other known physiological instance of LC3 localizing to the plasma membrane occurs in osteoclasts during lysosomal secretion (DeSelm et al., 2011). Our electron micrographs revealed autophagosomes close to the plasma membrane, consistent with the idea that the LC3 at the plasma membrane results from fusion of vesicles. If true, this mechanism suggests that the primary biological purpose of the M2 LIR motif is to deliver appropriate membrane resources for the generation of virus particles. On this account, the M2 protein would ensure both the availability of new transport vesicles by manipulating autophagy downstream of FIP200, and the correct delivery of that lipid resource to the plasma membrane via the LIR motif.",

This is consistent with the LIR motif predominantly restoring the depleted plasma membrane of host cells as virus particles bud, rather than contributing directly to the viral membrane. Cells produce up to 104 IAV particles (M\u00f6hler et al., 2005). Even if only 1,000 spherical virus particles were produced, their surface corresponds to a substantial fraction (\u223c20%) of the apical plasma membrane. The far greater amount of membrane required to produce a filamentous virion suggests that, as seen here, LIR function is of particular importance in supporting filament formation. Given that many other RNA viruses (especially respiratory pathogens) produce filamentous particles (B\u00e4chi and Howe, 1973; von Magnus, 1953; Yao and Compans, 2000), it may be that other enveloped viruses have also evolved mechanisms to mobilize lipid resources from host cells via autophagy.",

Ultrastructural studies of viruses lacking the M2 C terminus (and thus the LIR motif) showed that even spherical virions had decreased structural integrity (Sugita et al., 2011).
