We did not, however, completely halt the services to some patients who need to visit the dermatology outpatient department during the 2019-nCoV outbreak. At the same time, to meet the medical requirements and reduce the flow of patients to the skin clinic, we began free online and telephone consultation by providing free dermatology consultations. The dermatology outpatient department in West China Hospital was scheduled to run on January 28, 2020, mainly for critical care patients. Patients who had made an advanced appointment for obtaining medical service but chose not to visit received a full refund of registration fees.",

At the entrance of the building, anyone with a fever (body temperature $37.38C), travel history to Wuhan in last 2 weeks, clear contact with residents in Wuhan in last 2 weeks, or contact with people with a fever would be directly sent to the fever clinic for screening. These individuals are considered to have been exposed and are quarantined for 2 weeks, and potential exposures are also asked to quarantine themselves for 2 weeks at home.",
