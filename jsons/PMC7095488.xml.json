Mice expressing a tamoxifen-dependent lacZ gene under the control of the Krt5 promoter12 (Tg (KRT5-CreERT2) ROSA26-lsl-lacZ)13 were treated with tamoxifen before intratracheal delivery of H1N1 influenza virus (Fig. 1c; Extended Data Fig. 1b). At 0 dpi, lacZ activity was not detectable in whole-mount lung and yet Krt5+ cells were evident in distal lung as clusters of peribronchiolar Krt5+p63+ cells were observed in one of three to four consecutive sections of lung. Approximately 50% of these cells expressed Escherichia coli-specific \u03b2-galactosidase (7 clusters of p63+ cells were observed in 25 slides with a total of 39 p63+ cells, of which 19 were \u03b2-galactosidase positive; Fig. 1c). No labelling of other cell types in the lung was observed. In addition, colonies of distal airway stem cells (DASC) with long-term self-renewal (passage 4) were generated7,14,15 from three 0 dpi mice and stained with antibodies to Krt5 and \u03b2-galactosidase. All 256 colonies stained with anti-Krt5 antibodies and 132 co-expressed \u03b2-galactosidase (Fig. 1c; Extended data Fig. 1c). At 9 dpi, lacZ activity was subtle and restricted to the airways (Fig. 1c), consistent with our previous observations that at 9 dpi, p63+Krt5+ cells had accumulated within mouse bronchioles with no evidence of migration to interstitial regions7. By 15 dpi, however, the lacZ signal was significantly more robust and included broader regions of interstitial lung (Fig. 1c; Extended Data Fig. 1d). At 60 dpi, the lacZ signal was distributed along the conducting airways and the surrounding interstitial regions, suggesting a progressive process (Fig. 1c). Importantly, no lacZ activity was detected in the lungs of tamoxifen-treated mice in the absence of infection, indicating that the robust signal we observed was in response to lung damage (Extended data Fig. 1e). Histological analysis of the lacZ-positive regions of lung from infected mice revealed broad interstitial areas of staining corresponding to alveoli and that 72 \u00b1 7% of 1,051 lineage-labelled cells expressed type I (1H8+ and Pdpn+) or type II (SPC+) pneumocyte markers with the remainder being secretory cells in the bronchioles (n = 3 mice; Fig. 1d; Extended Data Fig. 1d, f).",

Consistently, DASCp63/Krt5 from the Krt6a\u2013DTR mice were found to co-express DTR and Krt6a in vivo and in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 2c, d). To test this ablation model in vivo, we infected the Krt6\u2013DTR mice with influenza virus and injected diphtheria toxin at 8 dpi (Fig. 2a). By 15 dpi, exposure to toxin resulted in a rapid loss of interstitial clusters of Krt5+Krt6+ cells (Fig. 2b, c), indicating that we had generated a highly efficient ablation model. Compared to wild-type controls, Krt6\u2013DTR mice lost 90% of Krt5+ cells and over 99% of Krt6+ cells following diphtheria toxin treatment (Fig. 2c).",

Focal infiltrates of leukocytes appearing as haematoxylin-eosin staining densities form at about 10\u201315 dpi in wild-type mice and are typically resolved over the next 15\u201345 days7 (Fig. 2d, e). However, in diphtheria-toxin-treated Krt6\u2013DTR mice, these densities fail to resolve over time (Fig. 2d, e). The persistent damage in DASCp63/Krt5-ablated lungs is also evident by whole-lung genome expression analyses (Extended Data Fig. 3a, false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.001). Histological comparisons of the persistent densities at 30 dpi revealed the possible basis for this difference. Although wild-type lungs at 30 dpi still display some lung densities, nearly all of these densities were negative for the CD45 leukocyte marker and instead possess unusual networks of Pdpn+ type I pneumocytes (Fig. 2f; Extended Data Fig. 3b). These networks of type I pneumocytes lacked markers of type II pneumocytes (Extended Data Fig. 4). Interestingly, these networks stain positive for other type I pneumocyte markers (Aqp5) but not all (for example, Hopx; Extended Data Fig. 4), suggesting the possibility that the type I pneumocytes in these networks are undergoing a maturation process. Remarkably, similar alveoli-like structures formed by type I pneumocytes lacking type II pneumocytes in anatomical analyses of mice recovering from infection by the NWS influenza A virus were reported nearly 40 years ago18. In contrast to the type I pneumocytes networks in persistent densities of wild-type mice, DASCp63/Krt5-ablated mice showed no such alveolar networks at 30 dpi (Fig. 2f) and instead maintained persistent infiltration of leukocytes evidenced by anti-CD45 staining (Extended Data Fig. 3b).",

Using pulse oximetry19 to assess peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), we found that the normal 95% SpO2 values plummeted to approximately 70% in normal and DASCp63/Krt5-ablated mice eight days following infection. However, the normal mice recovered to 90% SpO2 by 40 dpi, whereas the DASCp63/Krt5-ablated mice only reached SpO2 values approaching 75% saturation (Fig. 2g). Consistent with this apparent decline in pulmonary function, the persistent densities in the 30 dpi Krt6\u2013DTR lung showed staining for smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA; Extended Data Fig. 5), a marker of myofibroblasts known to be associated with a pre-fibrotic state of the lung20. These same interstitial regions showed weak but detectable staining with Masson\u2019s trichrome blue, a marker of fibrosis (Extended Data Fig. 5). Correspondingly, whole-genome expression profiles of wild-type and DASCp63/Krt5-ablated lungs indicated the persistence of inflammatory gene expression and a relative decrease in gene expression linked to vasculature development in the DASCp63/Krt5-ablated lungs at 30 dpi (Fig. 2h; Extended Data Fig. 5). Moreover, the DASCp63/Krt5-ablated mice showed the presence of pre-fibrosis gene signature21,22 including vimentin, FSP1 and collagen genes (Fig. 2h). Together these data suggest that the ablation of DASCp63/Krt5 arising during acute injury results in a failure of the regenerative process with structural and functional consequences for the lung.",

This is reflected in the abundant Krt5+ cells in proximal lung (Fig. 3a) and the intermittent, peri-bronchiolar clusters seen in one of every three to four sections of distal lung (Fig. 3a, arrows). Consistently, 100-fold fewer DASCp63/Krt5 colonies arise from cell suspensions of distal lung than tracheobronchiolar stem cell (TBSCp63/Krt5) colonies from proximal lung (Extended data Fig. 6a). Regardless, both DASCp63/Krt5 and TBSCp63/Krt5 can be cloned and propagated as single-cell-derived pedigrees7 that show very different fates upon differentiation. In air\u2013liquid interface (ALI) cultures24, TBSCs yield a stratified epithelium with Krt5+ basal cells and apical ciliated and secretory cells typical of proximal airway, while DASCs yield a monolayer of differentiated cells expressing Pdpn (Fig. 3b; Extended Data Fig. 6b). In three-dimensional Matrigel cultures, DASCs form unilaminar, alveolar-like spheres composed of cells expressing type I (Pdpn and Aqp5) and type II (SPC) pneumocyte markers (Fig. 3c). The very minor variation in gene expression between TBSCs and DASCs (less than 1% with fold change > 1.5, P < 0.05; Fig. 3d) transforms to major differences between TBSCs differentiated in air\u2013liquid interface (TBSC-ALI) with DASCs in Matrigel (DASC-MAT), consistent with their divergent fates (Fig. 3e). To further probe the differential fates of TBSC-ALI and DASC-MAT, we used laser-capture microdissection (LCM) to generate gene expression profiles of normal tracheal and alveolar epithelium and compared with those of TBSC-ALI and DASC-MAT (Fig. 3f). Gene-set enrichment analysis revealed a strong coincidence in gene expression patterns between in vitro-differentiated TBSCs and DASCs and their in vivo counterparts (FDR q value < 0.001), including many genes not previously identified as differential markers though confirmed by publically available antibody data sets24 (Fig. 3g).",

We delivered one million TBSClacZ or DASClacZ to syngeneic mice five days after influenza virus infection (Fig. 4a). At 40 dpi (35 days post-transplantation), DASClacZ were distributed in interstitial regions emanating from airways (Fig. 4b). At 90 dpi, DASClacZ showed a more homogenous pattern in interstitial spaces compared to 40 dpi (Fig. 4b). Significantly, mock-infected lungs, or mock-transplanted, infected lungs, showed no incorporation of DASClacZ at 35 days post-transplantation (Fig. 4b: Extended data Fig. 7b). As with the lineage-tracing experiments, we used E. coli-specific \u03b2-galactosidase antibodies to mark the transplanted cells in 90 dpi lungs and observed that at least 40% of the cells in alveolar region express pneumocytes markers (Pdpn, 1H8 and SPC) and at least 80% of the \u03b2-galactosidase-positive cells in bronchiolar region express secretory cell marker CC10 (mouse number n = 3; Fig. 4c; Extended data Fig. 7c). Gene expression analysis of the lacZ-positive regions of these lungs using laser-capture microdissection revealed a typical alveoli gene signature very different from that of immature DASCs or of damaged lung (Fig. 4d). Together these findings demonstrate that single-cell-derived pedigree lines of DASCs can readily incorporate into damaged lung during the process of lung regeneration and give rise to multiple epithelial cell types of bronchioles and alveoli. In contrast, transplanted TBSClacZ appeared confined to major airways (Fig. 4e). Parallel transplantations with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labelled DASC (Fig. 4f) yielded similar patterns of co-labelling of lineage and type I and type II pneumocyte markers at 40 dpi seen with transplanted DASClacZ (Fig. 4f). Significantly, a fraction of these transplanted DASCGFP or their progeny continue to express the proliferation marker Ki67 even up to 60 dpi (Extended data Fig. 8), suggesting their high viability and extended contribution to the regenerative process. Lastly, morphometric analyses of diphtheria-toxin-treated, virally infected Krt6\u2013DTR mice indicate that transplantation of DASCs results in a significant reduction of interstitial densities at 40 dpi (Extended data Fig. 9).",

Thus DASCp63/Krt5 act in an emergent, conditional manner that is generally distinct from that of type II pneumocytes25,26,27,28,29, progenitor cells of limited self-renewal capacity that participate in highly focal, homeostatic lung repair.

Retrieval and linearization of a selected section of this mBAC resulted in the targeting construct, which was electroporated into V6.4 B6.129 hybrid embryonic stem cells to be selected with G418. Single colonies screened by Southern blot analysis of PacI digests detected by a 5\u2032 external probe (hybridizing unmodified Krt6a genomic DNA) revealed fragment size differences due to the introduced PacI site. Wild-type alleles with endogenous PacI sites returned 35.9 kb fragments, while a recombination event returned a shorter 14.7 kb. Floxed NeoR probes provided further verification for a single specific insertion. Successfully engineered embryonic stem cells were microinjected into blastocysts to generate chimaeras, which were similarly tested for germline transmission via backcrosses to C57BL/6. Progeny from crosses with FVB/N-Tg(ACTB-cre)2Mrt/J (Jackson Laboratory, USA) were screened for stable transmission of Krt6a\u2013DTR alleles Cre-mediated excision of Floxed NeoR as indicated by a reduced 12.9 kb PacI digest fragment.",

The dissociated cells were washed with wash buffer, passed through a 40-\u03bcm cell strainer, counted and plated onto irradiated 3T3 feeder cells as described7,14,15.

These colonies have been passaged up to 12 months with no observable phenotypic or chromosome count changes. To compare gene expression in immature TBSCs and DASCs, whole genome expression microarrays were performed on passage 7 (P7) cells. Figure 3c is a scatterplot comparison of the TBSC and DASC whole transcriptome data.
