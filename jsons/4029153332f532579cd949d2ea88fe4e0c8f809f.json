Now suppose that isolation alone can stop the spread of disease (i.e., R I < 1), so that the expected total number of infections occurring in the absence of quarantine will approach a constant value as time passes. Quarantine might nevertheless still be useful in this context by reducing the number of infections that occur before the outbreak ends.

The notation in the first set of parentheses in equation 1 represents the percentage of infections that quarantine can be expected to avert. Figure 2a plots equation 1 with I 0 \u00bc 1 for different values of the product qq. This represents the number of cases averted by quarantine for each initially infected individual. Even if quarantine is extremely effective (i.e., qq \u00bc 1), which requires that all asymptomatic individuals be identified and placed into quarantine (i.e., q \u00bc 1) and that an individual generates no new infections once quarantined (i.e., q \u00bc 1), quarantine still has only a marginal effect on the expected number of infections averted over a wide range in R I (which, recall, is the expected number of infections generated by an infected person if isolation alone is used). For example, if the reproduction number is R I \u00bc 0.5, then quarantine is predicted to prevent only one extra infection for each individual that was initially infected. The number of infections averted becomes significant, only when the effectiveness of isolation decreases to the point where it is no longer able to stop the spread of disease (i.e., only when R I approaches one). Also note that, because of the form of equation 1, its predictions are relatively insensitive to error in the estimates of R I unless R I is close to one (figure 2). Part of the reason that the expected number of infections averted is very small stems from the fact that, unless the reproduction number, R I , is close to one, very few infections will occur even if isolation alone is used. This can be better illustrated by plotting the percentage of infections that are averted by quarantine (i.e., the first factor in equation 1). Figure 2b illustrates how this increases to 100 percent when the effectiveness of isolation decreases (i.e., when R I increases). We can also see that, if most infections are generated by symptomatic individuals and if quarantine does little in terms of increasing the efficiency of isolation procedures (so that q ( 1), then quarantine will have very little effect on the number of cases averted or on the percentage averted.

The above results give an expectation of the number of infections averted by quarantine, but how likely is it that, by chance, the number might be greater than this? This question is more difficult to answer but, subject to some mild assumptions, one can derive a conservative estimate that applies for any distribution of infections generated by each infected individual, p 1 (\u00c1) or p QI (\u00c1) (Web appendix 2). Figure 3 plots a conservative 80th-percentile upper bound on the number of infections averted through the use of quarantine, for the best-case scenario in which the probability of quarantining an infected individual is one (i.e., q \u00bc 1). There is at least an 80 percent probability that the actual number of infections averted through the use of perfect quarantine in any given outbreak lies below these upper bounds. These results are very general and further strengthen the finding that quarantine is unlikely to have a significant impact unless isolation alone is relatively ineffective (i.e., R I is large). Furthermore, these analytical results appear to be quite conservative when judged against results from a fully stochastic simulation (Web appendix 3).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 612, "end": 620, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "Further insight can be gained from the above results by examining the case where there is very little asymptomatic transmission (q is small). This appears to be true for several diseases (table 1; Web appendix 4), including SARS (1, 4, 9, 20) . To apply the results to SARS, we require an estimate for the reproduction number when isolation alone is being used. There are currently no direct estimates of this parameter available, but we can estimate it indirectly by using the component parameter estimates of Gumel et al. (14) . Bearing in mind the uncertainty in such estimates, we obtain a potential range of values from R I \u00bc 0.28 to R I \u00bc 0.46. Taking R I \u00bc 0.5 as a conservative estimate, the results given by the bold curve in figure 3 (for which q \u00bc 0.05) suggest that there is a probability of at least 80 percent that the use of perfect quarantine for SARS (i.e., q \u00bc 1) would reduce the number of cases by no more than approximately 2.6 cases for each initially infected person (assuming that the values r I \u00bc 0.5 and r QI \u00bc 0.25 of figure 3 are reasonable for SARS). This is a very conservative upper bound on the expected outcome, however, and therefore, unless the variance in the number of infections generated by individuals is much larger than those used to generate figure 3, the use of quarantine is predicted to have very little effect. As a result, investing limited resources in ensuring that isolation is very effective (e.g., quick removal of symptomatic people from the population; extremely secure isolation facilities to prevent transmission by such individuals) is likely to be a much more valuable control strategy for SARS than the use of mass quarantine.
