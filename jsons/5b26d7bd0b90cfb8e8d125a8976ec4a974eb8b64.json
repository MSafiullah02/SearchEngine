When Caco-2 cells were infected with BCV, a titer of 5.5 \u00d7 10 6 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.)/mL was found in the culture supernatant at 5 days postinfection. Two clones, Caco-2/CA1 and Caco-2/CA2, were then isolated by monitoring alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cell proliferation activities. The ALP activity level of CA1 cells was significantly higher than that of CA2 cells, while the level of cell proliferation activity of CA1 was significantly lower than that of CA2. When CA1 and CA2 cells were infected with BCV at confluence, virus hemagglutination (HA) was detected in the culture supernatant at 5 days postinfection for CA1 cells and at 8 days postinfection for CA2 cells. Thus, BCV propagation was substantially delayed in CA2 cells, suggesting that a cellular factor(s) that appears at the differentiation stage may control BCV propagation. BCVsusceptible CA1 and CA2 cells showing different levels of ALP activity would be useful for further experiments to elucidate the mechanism of BCV propagation.",

The pellet was resuspended in distilled water, and ALP activity was measured according to the method described by Garen and Levinthal (1960) with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. A protein assay was conducted with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).

Interestingly, Caco-2 cells have been shown to have high susceptibility to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In the case of SARS-CoV, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 has been identified as a receptor (Li et al. 2003) and has been found to be the determinant of host cell restriction (Mossel et al. 2005) . Although further studies are needed, it is possible that expression of cellular factors, including the BCV receptor, is responsible for BCV propagation in ",
