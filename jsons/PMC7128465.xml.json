The additive effect of stimulating more than one TLR does not only increase the sensitivity of microglia during infections, yet may also entail interactions among exogenous and endogenous agonists of TLRs.

We transfected HL60 cells with a minimal IL-8 promoter containing different disrupted transcription factor binding sites, namely NFkB, AP-1 and the putative CRE with a luciferase reporter. However, LPS and LTA induced the same signal height both in cells with normal and mutated CRE, indicating this is a nonfunctional element, while NFkB and AP-1 were confirmed as essential elements. Moreover, cAMP elevation in human whole blood led to an increase in LPS-induced IL-8 release but a decrease in LTA-induced IL-8 release. This indicated that the strong LTA-induced IL-8 release was dependent on a different parameter, so we characterised this induction more closely. IL-8 mRNA expression peaked at 4 h in LPS-stimulated whole blood but continued to rise until 24 h in LTA-stimulated blood. In line, IL-8 protein levels induced by LTA became significantly higher than those induced by LPS only at time points after 8 h following stimulation and peaked at 28 h (stimuli 10 /4g/mL: LPS, 64 \u00b1 17 ng/mL IL-8 vs. LTA, 205 \u00b1 47 ng/mL IL-8, P < 0.01, n = 16).

To study the ability of these viruses to induce host cytokine and chemokine gene expression we infected human lung epithelial A549 cells with influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2 strains), influenza B and Sendai viruses, isolated total cellular RNA and analysed host cell cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression by Northern blotting and RT-PCR. Influenza A and influenza B virus infection lead to a relative weak induction of interferon (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and IFN-like genes, IL-28 (IFN-\u03bb2/3) and IL-29 (IFN-\u03bb1). The expression of IRF-3 and IRF-7 activating kinase, IKKe was also weakly induced by influenza viruses. In similar experimental conditions Sendai virus infection activated the expression of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IL-28, IL-29 and IKKe genes very well. Similarly, while Sendai virus readily induced TNF-\u03b1, CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL5 (RANTES), CXCL8 (IL-8) and CXCL10 (IP-10) gene expression, influenza A and influenza B virus-induced expression of these genes was either lacking (TNF-\u03b1) or occurred at a relatively low level. Pretreatment of A549 cells with IFN-\u03b1 lead to a dramatic increase in influenza A virus-induced IFN, IL-28, IL-29 and chemokine gene expression. This induction correlated with enhanced expression of virus-activated signalling molecules, TLR-3, IKKe and IRF-7. The results indicate that in human lung epithelial cells influenza A and B viruses are relative poor inducers of type I IFN, IL-28, IL-29 and chemokine genes, but their ability to induce these genes can be fully restored by pretreatment of cells with type I IFNs.",

In this study we sought to investigate the role of different pattern recognition receptors to inflammatory pathway triggered by P. aeruginosa. To this end, we have treated human monocytes with P. aeruginosa purified LPS (5 ng-50 \u03bcg/mL), Slime (5\u20135 \u03bcg/mL), or viable bacteria (10 bacteria/monocyte) in the presence of blocking antibodies specific for TLR4 (5\u20132 \u03bcg/mL), TLR2 (5\u201325 \u03bcg/mL), and Mannose receptor (5\u201325 \u03bcg/mL) and measured TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 production for 2\u201324 h. An isotype matching, nonspecific antibody was used as negative control. TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 induction was inhibited by 80\u201390% in the presence of anti-Mannose receptor and anti-TLR2 blocking antibodies, whereas blocking of TLR4 caused a less prominent inhibition (40%). Comparable levels of inhibition were obtained when monocytes were stimulated by P. aeruginosa Slime-GLP or whole viable bacteria. P. aeruginosa LPS caused a weak proinflammatory cytokine induction not amenable to blocking of TLR2, TLR4 or mannose receptor. Our results suggest that TLR2 or mannose receptor-mediated pathway could be a specific target for inhibition of inflammatory responses triggered by P. aeruginosa.\n",

We have previously shown that P. aeruginosa GLP is the most potent stimulant compared with homologous LPS, for TNF-\u03b1 production and NF-k\u03b2 activation in human monocytes. In this study, using fresh human monocytes stimulated for 15 min-6 h with P. aeruginosa LPS (5 ng/mL-50 \u03bcg/mL) or GLP (10\u201350 \u03bcg/mL), we show that secretion of TNF-\u03b1 induced by P. aeruginosa GLP and LPS was paralleled by phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK's) ERK1/2, p38 and the stress-activated protein kinases c-jun N-terminal kinases 1 and 2 (JNK). Phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 correlated with an increase of activity. TNF-\u03b1 levels were significantly reduced by (60\u201380%) and by (80\u201395%) when inhibitors of ERK1/2, PD98059 (50uM), or p38, SB203580 (10 \u03bcM) respectively, were added in the culture 1 h before stimulation. Combination of both inhibitors almost abolished TNF-\u03b1 induction. P. aeruginosa GLP differed from the homologous LPS only regarding the strength of p38 and ERK1/2 activation, with GLP leading to a stronger activation of p38 and ERK1/2. No differences were observed at the level of JNK activation between LPS and GLP. Involvement of TLR-2 and TLR-4 for phosphorylation of p38 was shown by employing specific blocking anti-human TLR-2 (10 \u03bcg/mL) and TLR-4 (10 \u03bcg/mL) antibodies. Activation of p38 induced by P. aeruginosa GLP was dramatically reduced in the presence of anti-TLR2 antibody and to a lesser degree in the presence of anti-TLR4, whereas the LPS induced stimulation was inhibited only in the presence of anti-TLR4. Our results suggest that P. aeruginosa GLP stimulates the MAP kinase pathway more effectively than the homologous LPS, probably by using different combination of TLRs.",

            "text": "\nCoxiella burnetii, an obligate intracellular parasite of eucaryotic cells, is the aetiological agent of Q fever. The disease is a widespread zoonosis and is endemic throughout the world. In humans, the acute form of Q fever is characterised as a flue-like illness or atypical pneumonia, or less frequently as granulomatous hepatitits with a significant incidence of neurologic complications. Persistent infections may lead to chronic form of the disease, which may be associated with endocarditis. Human infection is aquired most often by inhalation of contaminated aerosols, or less frequently, by drinking infected milk, infection through skin trauma, sexual contact or mother to fetus transmission. Upon serial laboratory passages in embryonated hen eggs, C. burnetii undergoes a virulent (phase I) to low-virulent (phase II) variation, which is accompanied by noticeable modifications in both composition and structure of the cell outer-membrane components. During the acute Q fever, antibodies against the phase II antigen are detected earlier and at higher titres than those against the phase I antigen. In contrast, titres to phase I antigen are higher during the chronic form of the disease. We have found that the phase I antibodies are mostly directed against the O-specific chain of the C. burnetii smooth-form lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A remarkable decrease in the serological activity of the LPS was observed when two unusual sugars virenose (Vir) and dihydrohydroxystreptose (Strep) were selectively removed from its O-specific chain. This indicates that most phase I antibodies are directed against the epitopes containing terminal Vir and Strep. Thus, our results may suggest that Vir and Strep are involved in the immunobiology of the disease. Mild acid treatment of the C. burnetii phase I cells resulted in a considerable degradation of the LPS and exposure of the surface proteins exhibiting a high-immune response to the phase II antibodies. ID SDS-PAGE revealed the most intense silver-stained proteins at about 29 and 60 kDa. The subsequent, initial proteomic studies have identified the latter protein as the Chaperonin 60 kDa (GroEL protein, heat shock protein B). This protein is localised in cytoplasm of several bacteria but a significant fraction of it is also associated with their cell envelopes. Most likely, the protein has a dual association also in C. burnetii as it is immunogenic. Further peptide mass fingerprinting is in progress.",

Colonisation requires Yersinia outer proteins (YOPS), which are virulence factors that are translocated into mammalian cells by a type III secretion system where they inhibit cellular functions. Competition studies in mice coinfected with wild type (WT) Yersinia and single yop deletion mutants (yopE, yopH, yopO) demonstrated that these Yops are important in colonization of the GI, MLN and PP. Previous work demonstrated that YopE, YopH and YopO have antiphagocytic activity in cultured cells. As phagocytes are an early defence used by the host to fight bacterial infection, we tested whether YopE, YopH and/or YopO target phagocytes in mice.",

The ratio of WT to mutant bacteria recovered from GI, MLN and PP tissues was quantified and compared with the ratio from WT mice. If a higher number of a yop mutant is recovered in the deficient mice compared with the nondeficient mice, then the mutant yop strain is more susceptible to phagocytes in the tissue studied.

Biofilm phenotypes have different susceptibility profiles. The Minimum Biofilm Eradication Concentration (MBEC) was measured on biofilm grown on pegs of the polystyrene plate.

All isolates were ica-positive and showed the phenotypic ability to form biofilm. As the control, five ica-negative, biofilm-negative strains were used. For the antibiotic testing, the plates of polystyrene with 96 pegs that fit into standard microtitre plates were used. The pegs of the plates were coated with poly-L-lysine and transferred into microtitre plate with a fresh overnight culture of staphylococcal strains to enable primary adhesion. For the quantification of attached cells sonification was used. After 18 h of biofilm formation the plates were transferred into microtitre plates containing logarithmic dilutions of antibiotics (penicillin, oxacillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, co-trimoxazole, erythromycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, teicoplanin and vancomycin). After overnight cultivation the plates were transferred into colorimetric medium, which indicates metabolic activity of surviving cells. The changes of the medium were detected spectrophotometrically. The MBEC was determined as the minimal concentration of antibiotics that eradicates the bacteria and so inhibits their metabolic activity. Results and conclusions: All the tested strains showed drastically higher resistance to all the above-mentioned antibiotics when tested in biofilm form. All antibiotics exceeded maximal concentrations achievable in human plasma. That explains why the treatment of these infections with normal dosage of antibiotics often fails. The study was supported by the grant IGA 6818\u20133 of the Ministry of Health and grant 0463-2003 FRVS.",

ESBL production was identified in 79% of the strains. Appropriate treatment consisted of meropenem (71%), temocillin (22%, given only for UI) and cefepime (6%) combined with aminoglycosides in 43 episodes (37%).

ICU-acquired Gram-negative infections were detected in 128 patients during the study period. Overall 163 Gram-negative infections were diagnosed. Of the 128 patients, 42 had IR Gram-negative infections and 86 had IS Gram-negative infections. Overall 173 Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical specimens of the infected patients.

IR Gram-negative bacteria were most frequently recovered from surgical site cultures (30.8%). However, IS Gram-negative bacteria were most frequently recovered from urine cultures (49.7%). According to the univariate analysis, hospital stay before ICU admission, hospitalisation period before ICU, length of ICU stay, surgical ICU stay, surgical operation, previous antibiotic use and previous administration of imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, fourth generation cephalosporin, aminoglycoside and glycopeptide were significant risk factors for IR infections (P < 0.05).

The broad spectrum including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. together with low rates of resistance and favourable pharmacokinetic properties make cefepime a drug of choice for initial empiric treatment of severe nosocomial infections.

The basic data processing is automated and uses a statistical model for early detection of unusually increased rates of the indicators monitored, based on a general linear model for left censored data. Direct standardization and weighting for the size of the monitored population are also used. In accordance with the European Commission decision on case definitions for reporting communicable diseases to the Community network one more change was made to the system.

Symptomatic UTI is manifest in two syndromes: One is acute pyelonephritis generally perceived as being a kidney infection, the second is cystitis, which is generally perceived to be a bladder infection. A recently defined category of potentially diarrheagenic E. coli is cell-detaching strains, which were originally defined by their capacity to detach tissue culture cells from solid supports in adherence assays. However, epidemiological studies have found that these strains are not really associated with diarrhoea, and their significance remains unknown. In this report, we describe the identification of urinary E. coli strains (isolated from patients with UTIs) capable of detaching HEp-2 cells monolayers and characterise these strains in detail. Serotyping revealed that most of the strains belonged to serotypes associated with extraintestinal disease, 06 was the most prevalent serogroup. Fifteen of 40 E. coli isolates from UTIs had the ability to detach HEp-2 cells in the adherence assay. The culture supernatant of these cell-detaching bacteria (concentrated 10-folds) caused the same detaching effect and contain several secreted proteins. Two of them were identified as Sat (Secreted autotransporter toxin), and haemolysin. Some other protein bands appears on the gel after SDS-PAGE electrophoresis of the supernatant, the most prominent and consistent of these secreted proteins had apparent molecular masses of 176, 120\u2013122, 110, 36\u201338 and 25 kDa. Western blot analysis shows that most of these proteins were recognised by secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) antibodies isolated from milk from Mexican women. The strong sIgA response to these secreted proteins obtained in this study indicates that such antigens stimulate intestinal or urinary-tract responses and may elicit protective immunity against uropathogenic disease.",

An alcohol-based disinfectant should be used to disinfect the rubber stopper of a blood culture bottle.

All children were febrile and neutropenic (granulocytes <100 cells/ml) by the time bloodcultures got positive. Two patients had undergone bonemarrow transplantation shortly before onset of bacteraemia (3 and 4 days). Six of the eight children had mucositis as possible source of bacteraemia. In all but one case, F. nucleatum readily grew on anaerobic cultures. In one case, growth failed, and F. nucleatum was identified by 16S rRNA PCR followed by sequence analysis directly from the bloodculture bottle. The patients were treated either with ceftazidime plus metronidazol or with meropenem for 5\u201314 days. All patients recovered, but one child had three recurrent bacteraemias due to F. nucleatum. Endocarditis was ruled out by a transthoracic echocardiography, but the port-a-cath was not removed. Another persistent focus such as an abscess or an infected thrombus was not found. Susceptibility data are available from seven of the 10 isolates. All strains were susceptible to metronidazol, amoxiclav, and clindamycin.

Not only specific microorganisms but also the infectious burden, defined as the number of pathogens to which a patient is exposed, has been associated with atherosclerosis. In this study, the infectious burden, determined directly \u2013 by identification of viable pathogens in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMCs \u2013 and indirectly \u2013 by serum antibodies detection \u2013 is correlated to the inflammatory and atherosclerotic status in haemodialysis (HD) patients, a population at high risk for cardiovascular disease. The viable forms of four microorganisms (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Herpes Virus I and II and Cytomegalovirus) were identified in patients' PBMCs by cell cultures and subsequent polymerase chain reaction. Serum IgG against the above pathogens and Helicobacter pylori were also determined. Inflammation was assessed by C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), three pro-, one anti-inflammatory cytokines and four adhesion molecules measurement. Atherosclerosis was defined by a scoring system using medical history data. The number of viable pathogens identified in PBMCs, in the 122 HD patients included in the study, were 0 in 22.1% of them, one in 33.6%, two in 43.4% and three in one patient. The number of IgG antibodies determined was one in 6.6% of the patients, two in 32%, three in 48.4% and four in 13.1% of them. Seropositivity wasn't significantly different between patients with or without the respective viable pathogen identified in PBMCs. Atherosclerosis was present in 40.2% of the patients and CRP, SAA as well as Interleukin-6 were increased in these patients. Neither inflammatory indexes nor atherosclerosis were significantly different in patients with a higher number of viable pathogens detected in PBMCs or in those with higher number of antibodies. The direct infectious burden determination (the number of viable pathogens in PBMCs) doesn't coincide with the serum (by IgG detection) infectious burden.

Prophylaxis of infections was carried out with aerosolised pentamidine, oral acyclovir and with unspecific gamma globulin. On day 20, the patient developed episodes of hypothermia, profuse sweating and shivering as well as confusion and abdominal pain. Routine blood analysis revealed no abnormalities except for a severe hyponatremia (Na 111 mEq/1), hypoosmolarity and a high cyclosporine concentration. A magnetic resonance of the brain showed bilateral lesions involving amygdala and hippocampus while the corpus callosum was present. An electroencephalogram showed diffuse slow waves. The lumbar puncture demonstrated: mononuclear pleocytosis (44 cells/ul), a high protein level (103 mg/dl) with normal glucose level (71 mg/dl). Viral studies were negative except for HHV-6 DNA, which was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid by PCR. With the diagnosis of HHV-6 encephalitis, foscarnet was started. As the symptoms of our patients were similar to those of Shapiros Syndrome, clonidine was added to foscarnet. After combined therapy was initiated control cerebrospinal fluid HHV-6 DNA PCRs were negative and a remission of the symptoms was observed. Five months after transplant the patient died.

            "text": "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the most common, fatal and transmissible neurodegenerative disease, most important in a group of human prion diseases. Effective therapy is not available. CJD occurs as sporadic (the cause unknown), genetic (with CJD-specific mutation of the prion gene) and iatrogenic, caused by transmission of the infectious agent by contaminated tissue or instruments. The first iatrogenic CJD reported in 1974 was caused by corneal transplantation. Subsequent experimental studies demonstrated infectivity in corneas of animals inoculated with CJD agent. At present there is no specific method for definite diagnosis of CJD intra vitam, therefore asymptomatic carriers of CJD-specific mutations are excluded from a tissue donation. Slovakia is characterised by exceptionally high percentage (75%) of genetic CJD patients with CJD-specific mutation E200K, and by a \u2018genetic CJD risk group\u2019, represented by asymptomatic carriers of this mutation. About 59% of these long-term observed carriers have been found to develop the disease. This experience as well as an increasing number of corneal transplantations initiated introduction of preventive genetic testing of all corneal donors. The testing started in April 2001. Since then 608 donors have been tested. DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood. Mutation E200K and polymorphism at codon 129 of the prion gene, indicating susceptibility to iatrogenic CJD, were tested in all donors. Since donors are a randomly arisen group representing the general population, results on 129 polymorphisms correlate with data for normal controls. Obtained distribution of codon 129 polymorphism demonstrated that majority of donors are homozygots, either methionine (48.4%) or valine (8.6%), indicating high susceptibility to CJD. These data are not in agreement with preponderance of heterozygots, reported previously by other authors or observed by us, but obtained in significantly smaller tested groups. Presented results suggest an urgent need to reevaluate the generally accepted indicators of genetic susceptibility to prion diseases. Concerning the tested genetic CJD risk, unexpectedly, two out of the 608 DNA examined were positive for mutation E200K. Carriers of CJD-specific mutation, present in a relatively small group of donors, justify the preventive measure introduced exclusively in Slovakia.",

A T451A and a E481G mutation was found in the PBP2b sequences in 65% and 86% of the PenI/R isolates, respectively.

The analysis of the pbp2x genes revealed a T338A alteration in the STMK motif in 71% of the isolates. Three isolates also had a Q552E change located near the KSG box.

The outer membrane and LPS profiles were analysed by SDS-PAGE and visualised by Coomassie blue and silver staining, respectively.

Efflux activity was examined by comparing the level of resistance in pre- and post-adapted strains in the presence of the efflux inhibitor, reserpine.

New ESBLs have emerged rapidly because of the overuse of antibiotics. A new SHV-derived extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (temporarily designated as SHV-52) conferring high-level resistance to ceftazidime but not cefotaxime was identified from an island-wide surveillance in 1998. Escherichia coli TSARI 981223, which is resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin, cephaloridine, Cefpodoxime and ceftazidime while being sensitive to cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, imipenem and the first-generation cephem cefazolin was isolated from the urine of a patient treated with beta-lactam antibiotics. Resistance to beta-lactams was transferred by conjugation from E. coli TSARI 981223 to E. coli JP995, and the transferred plasmid was about 50 kbp. The pi of this enzyme was 8.2. The ceftazidime resistant gene was cloned from the transferred plasmid. The sequence of the gene was determined, and open reading frame of the gene was found to consist of 861 bases (The GenBank accession number is AY223863). Comparison of SHV-52 with other SHV beta-lactamases suggests that the substitution of arginine for leucine-169 is important for the substrate specificity. Characterisation of the enzyme by molecular biological and enzymological methods will provide us information of the extension of substrate specificity. The three-dimensional model of the enzyme will provide critical information in modelling and developing new antibiotics in the future.",

Tuberculin test had a weal of 9 mm. Staining for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and culture of the discharge were both negative. Chest radiograph was normal. Contrast enhanced CT showed an enlarged left PG with filling defects and a mass extending to the parapharyngal region. Histopathological examination revealed a florid granulomatous process with areas of necrosis. Staining for AFB was negative but tissue was not cultured for Mycobacteria. Paraffin sections' PCR was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and TB parotitis was diagnosed.

The diagnosis of CTB remains troublesome, because of the difficulty of detecting mycobacteria in skin lesions by conventional laboratory methods. Lupus vulgaris (LV), the commonest of all forms of CTB can affect earlobes as well as the other parts of the body. In this article, we present a 20-year-old male patient with LV of left earlobe. In the initial period, Pyodermia was the misdiagnosis and the patient was treated superfluously with antibiotics for four years, elsewhere. The definitive diagnosis of the disease was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mycobacteria could not be seen or isolated by stained smears and conventional and radiometric culture methods from the skin biopsy specimens. The lesion was treated successfully with antituberculous chemotherapy (ATBC). PCR is a reliable and a very rapid method for establishing or confirming the diagnosis of CTB as seen in our patient.",

We set up an ELISPOT assay for IEN-gamma whose novelty consists of two multiepitopic peptides from ESAT-6 protein, selected by computational analysis, that allows the discrimination between latent and active TB and the monitoring of the efficacy of anti-TB therapy (Vincenti et al., Mol Med 2003; Carrara et al., Clin Infec Dis, in press). It is important to find new strategies to increase the sensitivity of the diagnostic assays. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the performance of this assay based on ELISPOT against other technical assays used in immunology laboratories, such as ELISA on cell culture supernatants, ELISA on plasma from whole blood cultures, proliferation assay evaluated by thymidine incorporation, intracellular cytokine staining evaluated by FACS. PBMC or whole blood from patients with active TB microbiologically confirmed (positive culture from biological fluids and/or PCR from biopsies specimens) were seeded in the presence or absence of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 proteins, their selected peptides, PPD, recall antigens, mitogens and their own controls. The results were obtained within one day by the ELISA on plasma or by FACS analysis, within 2 days by ELISPOT, and 5 days by proliferation assay or ELISA on cell supernatants. We found that the sensitivity of the ELISPOT assay was significantly higher compared with the proliferation assay (P < 0.05, to ELISA on cell culture supernatants and to FACS analysis although not statistically significant. However, a similar sensitivity was found between the results obtained by ELISPOT assay and ELISA on plasma from whole blood cultures. On the other hand, FACS analysis allowed the identification of the single cells involved in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific responses. In conclusion, immune-diagnostic assays based on the response to ESAT-6 and CFP10 selected peptides obtained by ELISPOT or ELISA performed on plasma from whole blood are comparable, whereas a sub-optimal sensitivity is found with proliferation assay, FACS analysis and ELISA on cell culture supernatants.",

PCR results were compared with previous clinical cultures if available. Mycobacterial DNA was shown in 12 of 51 materials (24%). M. tuberculosis was found seven times (14%). The other samples contained M. fortuitum (4 times) and M. avium, respectively. Clinical culture of two more patients showed M. tuberculosis. Three samples containing mycobacterial DNA, which showed reactivity with genus probe pMyc5a but not with one of the specific species probes, were determined by sequence analysis.

The currently used 16S rRNA PCR combined with reversed line blot can only determine to species level if specific probes, which show a variable amount of disturbing cross reactivity, are added. Sequential analysis of hypervariable regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene can determine more mycobacteria to the species level without time-consuming subculturing. The aim of the study is to develop an identification method of mycobacteria by sequence analysis of hypervariable regions of PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal RNA gene. The amplified region has a length of about 590 base pairs. Sixty positive cultures of mycobacteria (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. avium, M. intracellulare, M. kansasii, M. chelonae, M. malmoense, M. scrofulaceum, M. marinum and M. gordonnae) collected during the last 10 years were analysed, including various strains which could not be determined previously. The 16S rRNA genes sequence was compared with the public RIDOM database of mycobacteria available on the Internet. Results of the sequence analysis excellently matched with reversed line blot and biochemical methods. Cross reactivity in reversed line blot could be explained by probe and strain sequence homology and one strain previously considered as M. tuberculosis by mistake was now correctly identified as Mycobacterium holsaticum. We conclude that sequence analysis of mycobacteria is a reliable technique that is applicable for routine use in our laboratory.",

Furthermore, he was given medical treatment according to this diagnosis consisting of corticosteroids. We planned to investigate tuberculosis in this patient whose complaints increased despite the steroid therapy. For the diagnosis, colonoscopy was performed at first and multiple ulcers were seen in the cecum, transverse colon and ascending colon; ileocecal valve was infiltrated. Regarding diffuse involvement of Crohn's disease, upper GIS endoscopy was performed in order to see the oral cavity, oesophagus, stomach and duodenum. As a result, the oesophagus was found to be normal; edema in the epiglottic area and pangastritis were observed. Colonic biopsies indicated granulomas and were positive for acid-fast bacilli. Acid-fast bacilli were also positive in the sputum. In addition to that, chest x-ray and thorax CT showed bilateral infiltrates in both pulmonary apices. PCR test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive all for biopsy, sputum and stool. According to the diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis, anti-tuberculous therapy (INH + Rifampin + Pyrazinamide + Streptomycine) was started and a good response was observed at the end of two weeks. Later on, the diagnosis was absolutely confirmed by the cultures. Tuberculosis should be added in differential diagnosis in the patients suspected of Crohn's disease particularly before starting immunosuppressive therapy.",

Bigger family groups were evident at a 65% similarity index and further studies could confirm the opinion that transmission rates might be higher and should be calculated differently. The fact that no W-Beijing strains were found could be due to high unemployment and therefore low migration of patients between study areas. The findings of this study indicate the need for continuous resistance monitoring, molecular epidemiological surveillance and active contact tracing as part of the Free State Tuberculosis Control Program.",

Two independent matched cohort studies were performed. Matching was (1:2-ratio) based on severity of underlying disease and acute illness (APACHE II score and admission diagnosis) and length of ICU stay prior to the onset of the candidemia. As expected, mortality can be derived from APACHE II. This matching procedure results in an equal prognosis for cases and control subjects. Attributable mortality is determined by subtracting the hospital mortality rate of the controls from that of the candidemic cases.",

Microbial samples were taken from surfaces before and after disinfection with UVC (33\u201347 min) and chloramine (5%, 1 h exposure) using standard contact plates (20 cm2). The UVC-distribution in the isolation units was monitored at 165 positions. The output on the floor varied between 0.08 and 3.2 W/m2, with an average (\u00b1SD) of 2.2 \u00b1 0.5 W/m2 in the patient room, 2.0 \u00b1 0.7 W/m2 in the sluice and 1.4 \u00b1 0.5 W/m2 in the bath/decontamination room. On other places, the values varied from 0.08 to 6.82 W/m2. The units were UVC-disinfected for 33\u201347 min, corresponding to doses ranging from 160 J/m2 in shadowed area to 19 230 J/m2 at the highest exposed site. According to published UVC-dosimetry, the survival of bacteria and bacterial spores are reduced by 90% with doses ranging from 4\u2013120 J/m2 and 100\u2013365 J/m2, respectively. Thus, UVC doses used in this study should be high enough to inactivate most bacterial organisms, including spores, even on surfaces not directly exposed to UVC. UVC-disinfection significantly reduced the bacteria on surfaces directly or indirectly exposed to UVC to a very low number (from c. 30 to 1\u20132 cfu/plate), as did 5% chloramine disinfection (from c. 30 to 1\u20132 cfu/plate) alone; P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively. Since cleaning before disinfection may be a risk for the staff in isolation units, disinfection with UVC- or chemicals should always be performed first. The presence of completely shadowed areas in the isolation unit (the bed rail, lockers, mattresses etc.) still needs disinfection by chemicals before cleaning. Therefore, UVC may not be used alone, but is a good additive to chemical disinfection, to lower the biological burden of infectious agents in isolation units for high-risk infectious patients.",

The rate increased during ICU rebuilding when housed in a temporary facility, indicating failures in infection control as a factor in increased infection rates. Transfer to a new facility resulted in reduced MRAB, but burn severity and duration of ICU stay continue to be a predictor for individual patient MRAB infection. From July 2000 to September 2002 there were 52 MRAB bacteraemias. In 56%, bacteraemia (and cannula tip infection) was the first indicator of MRAB colonisation. After the Bali bombing in October 2002, eight victims were admitted to ICU. On admission, 7/8 were colonised with MRAB, with 12 different susceptibility phenotypes demonstrable, including isolates susceptible only to polymyxin. All differed to MRAB clone A. Some of these strain types have now supplanted the original clone A, as dominant MRAB epidemic strains. Genetic relatedness typing presentation and performance is being planned. There has been a resultant increase in demand for polymyxin use for suspected MRAB infection. Environmental swabs have yielded variable results.

It is thus likely that an increasing prevalence of HCV infection is also found in pregnant women. To assess the frequency of HCV infection in the metropolitan area of Helsinki selected anti-HCV antibody testing was carried out for pregnant women during the years 1991\u20131999. Altogether 145 mothers were identified among 44 680 mothers. The frequency of anti-HCV positivity rose from 0.13% in 1991 to 0.43\u20130.53 in 1997\u20131999. In early 1990s only 20% of mothers knew about their seropositivity, whereas by the end of the follow-up period almost 70% of mothers knew about their HCV infection already before the pregnancy. Intravenous drug abuse was the major risk factor (71% of cases) for contracting the disease. In 90% of the mothers chronic HCV infection was well under control and in this population the mean serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values decreased towards the end of the pregnancy. However, 10% of anti-HCV Ab positive mothers developed intrahepatic cholestasis (odds ratio 16.4) as characterised by itching and elevated serum bile acid levels. The corresponding value in the control pregnancies was only 0.7%. Anti-HCV Ab positive mothers were younger, delivered earlier and gave birth to babies with smaller birth weight as compared with control deliveries. To have a more comprehensive view of the problem of HCV infection during pregnancy randomly selected serum specimens from the Finnish maternity cohort were tested. 2000\u20135000 serum specimens were tested in selected cohorts (1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000). In 1985, the prevalence was 0.19% and it steadily role to 0.42% in 2000. In the metropolitan area of Helsinki the prevalence was higher being 0.68% and 0.70 in 1997 and 2002, respectively. Our study indicates that there is an increasing problem of HCV infection in pregnant women in Finland. Although most women cope well with their disease during pregnancy there is a subpopulation of mothers who develop cholestasis and their liver status should thus be followed-up carefully. Testing of all mothers for serum anti-HCV antibodies is recommended.",

We have studied the epidemiological characteristics of the infection by HCV in an area about 311 720 people, detecting 314 carriers (prevalence of 1007 by 100 000 inhabitants). The average age is of 41 years old (range 13\u201379), corresponding the majority to men (76.8%), with an average age of 39.8 years old, lower than the women (44.6). The global genotypical distribution shows the group 1 as the most frequent (64%), following of the 3 (21%) and the 4 (11%), although the genotype changes based on other parameters like the co-infection with HIV. Among HIV+ the most frequent is the 1a (30.8%), following 3a (23.1%), 1b (21.2%), 4c/4d (16.1%), etc. In the other side among population HIV \u2013 the most frequent is 1b (50.1%), following of 3a (19.2%), 1a (16.5%), 4c/4d (5.1%), etc. Other genotypes have been in a proportion far below. Globally, in the distribution by sex, 1b emphasises the predominance of the genotype 1b (47.9% in women and 32.8% in men), following of 1a with similar numbers (21.9 and 23.7%). It is only showed significant differences in the genotype 3a in relation to sex, since it is detected in 9.6% of women and 24.1% of men; in four position is 4c/4d with percentage next to 10% in both groups. In relation to the route of infection, the parenteral one was the most frequent (76.6%) mainly in HIV (79.7%), to which is added 3.9% whose route could by sexual, in addition to the previous one. The rest of transmission routes were inferior to 5%. When studying the years since the infection was acquired, we have observed that between the no-HIV group the incidence had not varied, whereas in HIV+ it decreased. With these results we observed the existence of a high prevalence of HCV in our sanitary area, fundamentally in men, related to infection by HIV in half of the cases, mainly parenteral acquisition (with tendency to the diminution in the HIV carriers) showing great predominance the genotype 1, varying in the different populations.",

However, 19 different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified: four SNPs in Gauthier strain, 18 in Samoan D and 19 SNPs in CDC-2. Twelve (of 19) SNPs cause amino acid changes. Characteristic pattern of SNPs for each strain allowed PCR specific detection of these sequence changes. We developed PCR diagnostics to distinguish pallidum strains from pertenue strains and to unambiguously detect pertenue strains.

            "text": "\nLeptospira is a genus of spirochetal bacteria and the causative agent of leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease with a global distribution. The extensive serovar diversity has been attributed to differences in the structure and composition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Much work has focused on the role of leptospiral LPS in immunity. Preparations of leptospiral LPS can elicit protective in immunity, but this immunity is generally serovar-specific. Among the many antigens isolated from pathogenic Leptospira, glycolipoprotein (GLP) is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease inducing lymphocyte and monocyte activation. The focus of research on protective antigens and better serodiagnostic strategies has shifted toward conserved antigens, which may be able to stimulate heterologous immunity. The identification of leptospiral antigens expressed during infection has potentially important implications for the development of new serodiagnostic and immunoprotective strategies. In this work, we study candidate antigens for serodiagnosis using the ELISA-dotblot reactivity of sera from patients with leptospirosis confirmed by microscopic agglutination test (MAT). ELISA-dotblot analysis was performed using sera from patients with leptospirosis and sera from patients with other diseases as negative control. GLP is identified as a candidate antigen for serodiagnosis of leptospirosis. Seven-day-old culture of Leptospira interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae was used for preparing the antigen. Serum samples were assayed by ELISA-dotblot using our antigenic preparation and by a microscopic agglutination test (MAT) using 19 serovars. The antigen prepared had aproximately 220 \u03bcg/mL of GLP. IgG antibodies didn't show reactivity in all positive sera by MAT. However, on the basis of IgM response, all positive sera by MAT were found to react with GLP. None of the controls were positive. These preliminary observations demonstrate that GLP is a newly identified antigen which is recognised by sera from patients with leptospirosis. These data provide tools to understand the pathogenesis of leptospirosis and the identification of candidate antigens for serodiagnosis and immunoprotection.",

The bottles were cultured using two instruments after they were stored at room temperature and at 35\u00b0C incubators for 0, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. Five sets (60 pairs) of each bacteria were studied for each temperature. All the positive and negative cultures (after 5 days) were recorded and subcultures were performed. None of the cultures were false negative in the first 12 h of delay except two strains (S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae) in BA, after preincubation at 35\u00b0C. At 24 h of delay, false negativity was 14/60 for BD (E. coli 4, A. baumannii 3, E. faecalis 4 S. pneumoniae 3), 8/60 for BA (S. pneumoniae 8). False negative results were from bottles preincubated at 35\u00b0 C in BD. At 48 h of delay, false negativity rate was 34/70 for BD (E. coli 10, B. fragilis 10, E. faecalis 6, S. pneumoniae 5, A. baumannii 2, H. influenzae 1), 15/70 for BA (S. pneumoniae 9, A. baumannii 3, B. fragilis 3). For delayed preincubation (24\u201348 h) false negativity was more common in BD especially for storage at 35\u00b0C. BA had difficulty to detect S. pneumoniae starting from 24 h preincubation. Failures to detect microbial growth is noticed after 24 h for both systems.

Evidence of the family character of this infection additionally underlines the importance of the diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection especially its concealed, latent forms with asymptomatic course among adults and children as well. Considering the persistence of C. trachomatis infection in the organism and knowing that the most accurate method for the diagnosis of this infection in clinical specimens from all sites is the tissue culture technique employing cicloheximide treated McCoy cells, so called \u2018golden standard\u2019 we decided to investigate the cytomorphological peculiarities of C. trachomatis in the cultures of peripheral blood leucocytes of patients with urogenital chlamydiosis. For this aim the peripheral blood leucocytes of 14 patients infected only by C. trachomatis infection were studied using the original method of culturing. The diagnosis of C. trachomatis was confirmed by direct fluorescent-antibody technique. In vitro morphological inclusions specific for C. trachomatis were revealed in the cytoplasm of monocytes-macrophages, segmented neutrophils and even in lymphocytes, especially among children. In all cells these inclusions appeared to be PAS-positive cytochemically stained on glycogen. The use of peripheral blood leucocyte culture enabled us to diagnose the infection of C. trachomatis for the first time in 24 patients. Among them were two children at the age of 3 and 6 years and four patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, who applied to us for the estimation of immune reactivity of organism according to the amount of macrophage-lymphocyte rosette formation in vitro (Georgia Patent N 1296). In these cases the diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection was confirmed by direct or indirect immunofluorescent assays. According to our studies the macrophage-lymphocyte rosette formation was significantly decreased in 85% of patients with urogenital chlamydiosis composing 12\u201325% instead of 37.2 \u00b1 2.5% (observed in healthy donors), pointing to the decreasing of the functional activity of immunocompetent cells.

On physical examination, there was only a 10 cm length, superficial incision surrounding erythema area with purulent discharge on left parietal localisation. Other physical examination findings were normal. The full blood count showed a minor leucocytosis (14 000/mm3). The lesion was debrided and resutured. Culture was taken from the lesion. The patient was given empirical antimicrobial therapy with intravenous cefazolin 3 g/day and a protective dressing on the affected region. On the third day from admission and the start of the therapy, wound culture became positive for S. putrefaciens. The identification of the isolate was performed using mini API instrument with ID32 E (bioMerieux sa, Marcy-I'Etoile, France). The microorganism was sensitive to ceftazidime, cefepime, cefoperazone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem and aztreonam. The treatment was changed to ciprofloxacin (500 mg bid, p.o.). He responded well to the treatment. He was discharged on the fifth day, still on treatment with ciprofloxacin, which was definitely withdrawn 10 days later.",

No risk factor (tobacco consumption, diabetes mellitus, use of corticosteroids, viral infection) was present. When an antibiotic treatment was prescribed before the onset of the C, it was in adequation with the French guidelines. The C were noted after a pan sinusitis (involvement of all sinuses) in the majority of the cases, or after a frontal or sphenoid sinusitis. The responsible pathogens were identified in 53% of the cases, mainly Streptococcus spp., with or without combination to anaerobic bacteria. In the meningitis cases, S. pneumoniae was the main causative pathogen. The medical treatments prescribed were in accordance with the recommended standards. Conversely, the surgical management was more heterogeneous. Cure was obtained in 60% of the cases with a mortality rate of 2%. Sequels, essentially ocular, were not rare.

S. lugdunensis was isolated as a sole agent in 81% of cases. All but three cases have been confirmed as infections. Soft tissue abscesses (26) and skin infections (19) are predominant (48% of the overall). The other types of infection are: septicaemia (11), urinary-tract infections (eight), bone and joint infections (seven), surgical wound infections (five), prosthetic material infections (five), endocarditis (one), i.v. catheter-related infections (one), miscellaneous (five). The infection is nosocomially acquired in 31% of cases and associated with foreign device in 21%, mainly orthopaedic prosthetic material (nine cases). 28% of the isolates are \u03b2-lactamase positive and 2% are methicillin-resistant.",

Our survey was conducted to evaluate the frequency of true S. lugdunensis infections, and clinical data were collected and analysed in this aim. The preliminary results confirm the wide range of clinical patterns and emphasise the predominance of skin and soft tissue infections. Further investigations are actually conducted (i) to review the patients medical records by and independant physician, (ii) to search for virulence factors in the strains collected.",

In such circumstances, imipenem-cilastatin (I-C) is often the only remaining therapeutic option. We report our experience with the prolonged administration of high-doses of I-C in the treatment of osteo-articular infections with bacteria resistant to other \u03b2-lactam agents (or fourth generation cephalosporins in 14 cases). Our retrospective study over 7 years included 29 patients with septic arthritis (n = 3) continuous osteitis (n = 6), septic nonunion (n = 12) and prosthetic joint infections (n = 8). Treatment included an extensive surgical debridement and postoperative combination antibiotherapy with intravenous I-C and aminoside (54%) and/or fluoroquinolones (46%) and/or phosphomycin (29%). Associated microorganisms requiring yet additionnai antimicrobial agents were associated in 17 (59%) cases. I-C was maintained for an average of 46 days (extremes 21\u201390), at an average dose of 3.8 g/day (extremes 2\u20136). The bacteria warranting I-C were cephalosporinase hyperproducing Enterobacter cloacae (38%), extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamases producing enterobacteria (31%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21%) and/or Acinetobacter baumanii (21%). Early outcome was favourable in 24 patients (82%). Two patients relapsed with the bacteria requiring I-C, failure and two failed to negate succion fluid cultures: one was discharged with no change in his condition, one agreed to a leg amputation and the third died of candidemic septic shock while still bacteriologically positive. Repeated secondary colonisation and infection with yeasts led to a monitoring of yeast load, per os amphotericin B and immediate treatment of urinary colonisation prevented further systemic candidal infections. No other tolerance incidents were noted. Acquired resistance occurred only once in a P. aeruginosa isolate while imipenem-cilastatin was chosen to cover an ESBL producing Escherichia coli. Secondary treatment with ceftazidime was then successful in eradicating P. aeruginosa. I-C has been widely used for the treatment of mixed flora infections as a wide spectrum antibiotic. We report good tolerance of high posology long-term administration in documented osteoarticular indications if yeast colonisation is properly monitored, and eradication rates are comparable with those reported in infections with susceptible bacteria.",

Southern blot hybridisation and sequence analysis demonstrated that in STEC of serotypes 073:H18, 091:H21, and OH3:H21 cdt is located on the chromosome and is closely related to cdt-V from STEC O157:H-. In contrast, in STEC 0153:H18, cdt is on a large plasmid and is identical to cdt-III from necrotoxigenic E. coli. cdt-I, cdt-II and cdt-IV alleles were not identified. Supernatants of each of 17 cdt-positive STEC progressively distended and subsequently disintegrated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. No CDT activity was detected by the CHO assay in any of the remaining 323 STEC strains that were PCR-negative for cdt-I, cdt-II, cdt-III, cdt-IV and cdt-V suggesting that no additional cdt allele undetectable by the PCR approaches used occurred among the STEC strains investigated. Our data demonstrate that two different cdt alleles with different genomic locations encode biologically active CDT in STEC of particular non-O157 serotypes. Among eae-negative STEC, cdt was associated with disease (haemolytic uraemic syndrome or diarrhea) vs. asymptomatic infection (P = 0.003) suggesting that CDT might contribute to the pathogenicity of these organisms.",

The mutant prevention concentration (MPC) has been defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic to inhibit the emergence of mutants from 1010 CFU. Previous workers have hypothesised that the MPC as determined in vitro should minimise the emergence of resistance in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate the mutant prevention concentrations of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin in vitro against a panel of Salmonella enterica. The panel included the following types: (i) fully antibiotic sensitive strains, (ii) laboratory generated MAR phenotype mutants (cyclohexane resistant and c. fourfold increase in resistance to unrelated antibiotics such as, \u03b2-lactams, chloramphenicol quinolones and tetracycline), (iii) wild type MAR phenotype strains, (iv) gyrA mutants and (v) gyrA mutants with the MAR phenotype of Salmonella enteritidis (n = 5) and Typhimurium (n = 5). Methods. MICs were determined by the BSAC agar dilution method. MPCs were determined by applying 1010 CFU of respective strains to serially diluted antibiotic containing plates that were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 and 48 h. The MPC was recorded as the lowest concentration of antibiotic to prevent the emergence of any mutants at 24 h. Results. The MICs, MPCs and MPC/MIC ratios for ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin for the different groups of Salmonella are shown in Table 1. All MPC/MIC ratios for strains excluding MAR phenotype mutants without mutations in gyrA were in the range 2\u201316. The MPC/MIC ratios for the MAR phenotype mutants without mutation in gyrA were in the range 2\u201364.",

In the presented study the effect of subinhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) (1/4, 1/8, 1/16 of the MICs) of five quinolone antibiotics (enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin) on two P. shigelloides strains (H-human, W-surface water) was studied. It has been known that sub-MICs of antibiotics do not kill bacteria however they may have impact on their pathogenic potential.",

The strains after effect of some quinolones changed surface hydrophobicity towards the hydrophilic state. Motility of the strains treated with quinolones was in the majority of cases enhanced. Only ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin at 1/8 and 1/16 of the MICs in strain H and norfloxacin at 1/4 of the MIC in strain W reduced motility. Lipolytic activity of antibiotic treated strains was only slightly modified. Quinolones increased sensitivity of P. shigelloides to hydrogen peroxide with the exception of enoxacin and ofloxacin at all sub-MICs in strain H and norfloxacin (all sub-MICs) and ciprofloxacin (one sub-MIC) in strain W. The tested strains did not possess short chained acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs) and quinolones did not evoke their production.",
