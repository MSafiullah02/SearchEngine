Among these infections, whooping cough (pertussis) is particularly severe, with the WHO reporting more than 16 million cases of pertussis and around 195 000 deaths worldwide in 2008, 95% of which were in LMC [1]. Pertussis is caused by Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis). It is potentially preventable by vaccination and is characterized by a series of early symptoms which may be easily misdiagnosed as a common cold, followed by a series of paroxysmal symptoms at 1 or 2 weeks of evolution, which may include coughing, whooping sounds, vomiting among others that might result in death [2].",

This re-emergence of pertussis may be related to different causes, including less effectivity of the current acellular pertussis vaccine with respect to the whole cell vaccine [4], [5], the selection of variants of B. pertussis not covered by the vaccine [5], [6], as well as the underestimated role of other Bordetella species, as such as Bordetella holmesii\n[7]. Following these trends, in the last years an increasing number of cases, mainly in rural areas, has been described in Peru [8].",

In this line Achromobacter xylosoxidans (A. xylosoxidans) has been described as a cause of different infections, mainly bacteremia in immunosuppressed patients, but has also been related to respiratory diseases, including infections in patients with cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis and pleural emphysema, among others [10], [12], [13], [14], [15].
