            "text": "The majority of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are community-acquired and are the single most common cause of physician office visits and among the most common causes of hospitalizations [10, 68, 146, 182, 194]. The morbidity and mortality associated with RTIs are significant and the financial and social burden high due to lost time at work and school. Viral infections cause between 65 \u2013 80 % of respiratory tract diseases with mixed viral infections present in 5\u201320 % of viral RTIs in adults and as high as 62 % in studies of children \u2265 6 years of age [66, 80, 132, 172, 182, 194]. In Europe and in the USA the incidence of pneumonia due to a bacterial pathogen is 1\u201310 cases per 10,000 inhabitants, depending on various factors such as age. The differentiation of viral from bacterial RTIs can be assisted considering the rate of onset of illness, patient age, symptoms, radiographic changes, biomarkers, response to treatment, and the presence of documented viral epidemics in the community. However, the scope of clinical symptoms can significantly overlap among the respiratory pathogens, and the severity of disease can vary depending on patient age, underlying disease, and immune status, thereby leading to inaccurate presumptions about disease etiology.",

In health care settings, the identification of a viral RTI prompts the initiation of appropriate infection control measures, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality associated with nosocomial transmission [19, 39, 40, 62, 126, 155, 217, 219].",

This chapter focuses on the clinical utility, advantages, and disadvantages of these tests. Unfortunately, no FDA-cleared assays are available for the detection of the majority of bacterial and fungal pathogens associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-associated pneumonia (HAP), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). New promising technologies for the detection of bacterial agents of pneumonia currently in development or US FDA clinical trials are briefly reviewed. Although sensitive, accurate fungal diagnostics is an area of importance, the development of new diagnostic assays has been significantly delayed. Hence, for the detection of the vast majority of the nonviral pathogens, laboratory developed tests (LDTs) are the mainstay of molecular testing and will not be discussed. The importance of new rapid diagnostics for CAP, VAP, and HAP has been highlighted by a workshop conducted in November 2009 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the FDA, the proceedings of which have been published in a special supplement of Clinical Infectious Diseases [102].

Overall, viruses are the most common cause of URTIs and the second most common etiologic cause of CAP (behind Streptococcus pneumoniae), ranging from 13 \u2013 50 % of diagnosed cases [10, 146, 132, 172, 182, 194]. CAP in children is predominately of viral etiology, with the majority of the infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, 4 (PIV) [99, 194]. Influenza A (FluA) and influenza B (FluB), adenovirus (ADV), and the coronaviruses (CoVs) are additional causes of CAP in children. RTIs in non-immune compromised hospitalized children (especially < 5 years of age), are mainly due to infection with one or multiple viruses without a secondary bacterial infection. Viral CAP decreases in frequency in healthy young and middle-aged adults to about one-third of the cases, with influenza, HRV, and CoV being the most common agents. Viral CAP rates substantially increase among the elderly, often complicated by secondary bacterial infection. The most common viral causes of CAP in the elderly are influenza and RSV; however, HMPV, PIVs, CoVs, and HRV cause both URTIs and LRTIs [66, 194].\n",

The \u201cclassic\u201d influenza season begins generally in late October and wanes during April. HMPV prevalence tends to rise as RSV season wanes in February and peaks in the spring, PIV-1 and PIV-4 are most prevalent in the summer through fall, while PIV-3 prevails in the spring and PIV-2 in the fall. Virus prevalence also can be patient population driven (e.g., pediatric, adult, geriatric, outpatient, or inpatient). For example, RSV and HMPV are primarily found in children < 5 years of age, but can cause severe disease in all age groups [64, 65, 94, 97].

Risk factors for contracting Legionellosis include smoking, immunosuppression, age \u2265 65, chronic lung disease such as emphysema, diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, or contact with environmental systems such as air conditioning cooling towers, evaporative condensers, whirlpools, and hot spring baths.",

Pertussis-like illness can be attributed to Bordetella parapertussis, Bordetella holmseii, and rarely Bordetella bronchioseptica infections. Overall, Bordetella infections have increased dramatically over the last 10 years due to waning immunity, incomplete antibody response to vaccination with acellular vaccines, or lack of vaccination. Recent epidemics have occurred between 2010 and 2014. In 2010, more than 27,000 cases were reported, of which over 9,000 occurred in California. Nationwide by 2013 more than 28,000 cases were reported to the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/surv-reporting.html). The highest incidence was noted in infants < 1 year of age, but a significant amount of disease occurred among children aged 7\u201310 years. One large outbreak of pertussis-like illness in Ohio from 2010 to 2011 was attributed to both B. pertussis (68 % of the cases) and B. holmseii (29 % of the cases) [190]. Outbreaks of pertussis continue, highlighting the need for primary vaccination and the administration of \u201cTdap\u201d booster immunizations.",

Overall, the specificities of RADTs are good [21, 39, 45, 61, 75, 79, 125, 199]; however, the specificity for the detection of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 was significantly lower than previously reported [197, 198].

Traditional culture will identify ADV, enterovirus (EV), HMPV, FluA, FluB, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, RSV, and HRV, plus additional viruses associated with lower RTIs in immunocompromised patients, including CMV, HSV-1, HSV-2, varicella zoster virus (VZV). Often laboratories do not specifically screen for HRV by culture, although HRV is the most common respiratory virus detected and has been shown to cause significant and serious disease in young, elderly, immunosuppressed patients, as well as patients with underlying chronic lung disease such as COPD and asthma [83]. In addition, many additional important viruses (229E-CoV, OC43-CoV, NL63-CoV, HKU-1-CoV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), PIV-4, and potentially HBoV) that cause both URTIs and LRTIs are not routinely identified by traditional culture [83, 105, 200]. Finally, due to time-to-virus-detection by traditional culture (generally 3\u20137 days for most respiratory viruses and 3\u20134 weeks for slow-growing viruses such as CMV), results are usually not available within a time frame (48 h) that could affect patient management (i.e., initiate appropriate antiviral therapy and/or discontinue inappropriate antibiotic therapy). In summary, RADTs, DFAs, and rapid cell culture may provide results within a clinically relevant time frame but with limited pathogen scope and reduced sensitivity compared to NAATs. In addition, RADTs, DFAs, and rapid/traditional cell culture rarely detect more than one virus from a single sample.",

Often culture of respiratory specimens is not ordered on hospitalized patients and rarely performed in the outpatient setting. A gram stain result can be available within a few hours but results do not always correlate with culture [10]. Culture and antibiotic susceptibility results are usually available in 2\u20135 days after sample collection, and detection rates for pathogens are relatively low. A meta-analysis that evaluated 122 reports on CAP for the time period of 1966\u20131995 showed that a bacterial pathogen was only identified in 18 % of the samples tested [68]. A urinary antigen test for S. pneumoniae offers a substantial improvement over culture, with a sensitivity of 82 % and a specificity of 97 % in bacteremic adults [209, 210]. However, in non-bacteremic adults and in children, both the sensitivity and specificity are lower [210]. False-positive S. pneumoniae antigen tests have been reported relating to antibiotic interference. Legionella spp. are identified by growth on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar [158]. The sensitivity of Legionella culture can vary significantly from <10\u201380 % and DFA sensitivity from 25\u201370 % [158]. A urinary antigen test for L. pneumophila improves detection but is suboptimal since detection is limited to serogroup 1. For L. pneumophila serogroup 1 the sensitivity of the test varies from 70 \u2013 100 %. Most laboratories do not culture for Mycoplasma or Chlamydophila [140].",

However, due to a delay in the development of detectable IgM or IgG antibodies for certain pathogens (e.g., L. pneumophila, C. pneumoniae, B. pertussis), usefulness for diagnosis in a clinically relevant time frame is very limited [17, 151, 158, 221]. Shortcomings of serological testing include the timing of the serum samples, difficulty in obtaining appropriately paired serum samples, and the high background of IgG antibody prevalence in some adult populations [140]. Serologic diagnosis can be misinterpreted due to prior immunization or infections, such as in the case of influenza, and require demonstration of a significant rise in antibody titers from initial to convalescent samples. Finally, persons with immune suppression may not develop antibodies or they may be of an insufficient level for detection, limiting the functionality of serology for monitoring vaccine response and for epidemiology studies to determine prevalence rates.",

            "text": "The superior ability of NAATs to rapidly and accurately detect both known and novel pathogens was best exemplified during the chaos of the 2009 FluA H1N1 pandemic [18, 39, 79, 197, 198]. Fortunately, at the start of the pandemic two NAATs were FDA-cleared for the detection of influenza viruses, the Prodesse PROFLU+ (Hologic, San Diego, CA) for the detection and differentiation of FluA and FluB ([124]; and one highly multiplexed NAAT: the Luminex xTAG RVP Respiratory Virus Panel (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada) [113, 114, 143]. The xTAG assay enabled laboratories to detect FluA(H1N1)pdm09 and differentiate the seasonal FluA H1N1 (FluA-H1) and seasonal FluA H3N2 (FluA-H3), but also identify many other circulating viruses [79, 78]. As shown in Fig. 52.2, the number of samples positive for a respiratory virus increased dramatically with the use of the highly multiplexed xTAG RVP assay (64 %) compared to traditional test methods, including RADTS (17 %), DFA (18 %), and rapid cell culture (31 %) [79]. Interestingly, mixed viral infections containing up to four viral pathogens were identified in hospitalized patients [79]. Similarly, other studies have shown that when broad test panels are used more than one virus will be identified in 3\u201330 % of respiratory samples [8, 166]. Although the significance of mixed viral infections needs to be more clearly defined, the clinical impact needs to be considered as potentially severe in patients with comorbidities, immunosuppression, or other critical illnesses. During respiratory virus seasons with high influenza rates, patients with the same pathogen often are placed in hospital rooms together (cohorting) due to limited private rooms [19, 39, 40, 62, 126, 155, 165, 217, 219]. The consequences of a second viral infection in an already seriously ill hospitalized patient could be substantial, indicating that comprehensive test panels are essential in this setting.\n",

Viral respiratory pathogens are particularly suited for detection using NAATs since the number of targets is relatively limited and the detection of a respiratory virus is generally considered diagnostic, although asymptomatic carriage of certain respiratory viruses has been reported in several studies [2, 14, 104, 181]. For the majority of viral and atypical bacterial respiratory pathogens, NAATs offer enhanced sensitivity over culture, RADTs and DFAs (see Tables 52.2 and 52.3 for references), and the specificity varies with the target and assay design but is generally very high. NAATs also are suited for detection of respiratory pathogens that are not routinely or easily cultured (e.g., C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, HBoV, HMPV, and PIV-4), for pathogens dangerous to culture (e.g., SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), and for pathogens where the time-to-detection by traditional testing is often too delayed to impact patient care (e.g., influenza and CMV by cell culture).\n\n",

Conversely the identification of the viral pathogen can lead to the administration of an appropriate antiviral. For example, during the early weeks of the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, four different influenza viruses were circulating with varying antiviral susceptibility patterns. According to surveillance data provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, GA), FluA-H1 strains demonstrated >99 % resistance to the first line therapeutic oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor, and susceptibility to adamantine, FluA-H3 was oseltamivir-susceptible and >99 % adamantine-resistant, FluA(H1N1)pdm09 was oseltamivir-susceptible and >99 % adamantine-resistant; FluB was oseltamivir-susceptible and adamantine-resistant. Therefore, the identification of what specific strain of influenza virus was causing the infection of specific patients was essential to ensure proper drug selection, especially in high-risk or critically ill patients. Additionally, the more appropriate use of influenza antivirals can be achieved when an accurate, rapid diagnosis is made. Recent studies demonstrated that rapid testing permitted the timely administration of oseltamivir [229] and allowed for a more rapid discontinuation of treatment in persons without documented influenza [191]. Finally, new viral therapeutic agents for respiratory viruses other than influenza are in development and/or in clinical trials [171, 233]. Proper administration of these new agents will depend on the laboratory providing accurate tests that detect a broad range of viral pathogens [189].",

Therefore, rapid diagnostic tests are needed to identify infected patients upon admission, thereby preventing nosocomial transmission by facilitating isolation and appropriate cohorting decisions [165, 206]. Studies have documented significant nosocomial transmission of ADV, influenza, RSV, HMPV, PIV, and HRV in hospital units, chronic care facilities, and pediatric units [19, 40, 62, 126, 155, 217, 219, 232]. During the height of RSV season, when prevalence can be >50 %, high numbers of hospital admissions often require the cohorting of RSV-positive children due to a lack of private rooms. However, limiting diagnostic testing to RSV alone in a cohorting scenario could put other seriously ill children at risk for acquisition of a second viral infection with other pathogens such as HMPV or HRV [80]. The rapid identification of health care facility-acquired Legionella infection is essential so that the environment source can be identified and eradicated, thus preventing further transmission. In addition, PCR techniques are used to proactively routinely screen potential environmental sources.",

NP flocked synthetic swabs should be used in lieu of traditional synthetic NP swabs since flocked NP swabs yield a greater recovery of viral pathogens, with sensitivity comparable to NP wash specimens [1, 48, 95].

This is particularly important for respiratory samples that can be highly viscous and contain inhibitory substances and enzymes that destroy the target NAs. Some sample types may require a pretreatment with proteinase K or a similar enzyme. Highly efficient commercial NA extraction systems ensure sufficient NA recovery and the removal of inhibitory substances that could result in inefficient or no amplification of the target NAs. Presently, the majority of NA extraction systems use a chaotropic agent to lyse viral particles or bacterial cells, silica particles or a membrane to capture the released NAs, and a series of wash steps to remove inhibitory substances. NAs are generally eluted in either RNase/DNase free water or a stabilizing buffer such as EDTA-Tris. Although NA extraction can be performed manually using for example spin columns, the majority of laboratories currently use automated platforms that can extract as few as one sample at a time or more than 96 samples in microwell plate formats. Many NAATs have been FDA-cleared with specific extraction platforms or methods and laboratories should be aware that the substitution of another extraction platform or method constitutes a major change in the assay protocol. From a regulatory perspective, if the extraction procedure is modified or changed then the entire test is now considered an LDT. Laboratories must be compliant with all applicable state and federal CLIA standards, and may choose to comply with the College of American Pathologists regulations to meet state or federal regulatory requirements.",

In addition, the assay will detect 18 genes associated with the major categories of antibiotic resistance. Time-to-results is approximately 4\u20135 h. The assay serves as a preliminary screen to be followed by culture and traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Preliminary studies demonstrated that the assay detected more pathogens than routine culture.

            "text": "Overall, NAATs for respiratory viral and the atypical bacterial pathogens are highly sensitive (85 \u2013 100 %) and very specific (>95 %) when samples are collected shortly after the onset of clinical symptoms (see references in Tables 52.2 and 52.3). Assays can detect mixed infections [79] and a broad range of viral types within a family [34]. Performance results from clinical trials for FDA clearance and from investigator-initiated studies need to be reviewed carefully when evaluating an assay because many factors can affect the overall results, such as patient population and age, testing conditions, specimen collection factors, storage time from sample collection to testing, and comparator method used in the analysis. Similarly, results obtained in different studies can vary significantly for assays and targets, depending on the study design (see references in Tables 52.2 and 52.3). Numerous studies have demonstrated that not all targets within a particular assay are detected with the same sensitivity. NAATs also have certain limitations. Due to the complexity of primer and probe designs and interactions, highly multiplexed NAATs can sometimes be less sensitive than individual NAATs [70, 166, 167]. Reduced analytical sensitivity, however, does not always correlate with reduced clinical sensitivity since viral quantity in clinical samples, depending on the virus and timing of sample collection, are often much higher than the limit of detection of the assays. NAATs often are less sensitive for viruses with multiple serotypes, such as ADV [37, 74, 113, 133]. Decreased performance for the detection of ADV can be clinically significant, particularly when testing samples from immunosuppressed patients (e.g., transplant patients) for whom ADV infection has a high mortality rate if not treated. For high-risk patients, laboratories may elect to supplement testing with either a more sensitive, broadly reactive ADV-specific assay or with cell culture [25, 62, 148, 173]. Many of the assays cannot distinguish between HRV and EV due to the fact that the assays target the 5\u2032 UTR which is genetically similar for the two viruses [113]. The performance of the assays, in particular for RNA viruses, also may be affected by sequence mutations that occur over time. These mutations can result in primer/probe mismatches that decrease assay sensitivity, result in a total lack of target amplification and detection, or result in cross reactivity [153]. Any modifications to the assays to accommodate such genetic changes would have to be cleared by the FDA. In highly multiplexed assays, revalidation can require extensive assessment of all target interactions, thus making changes extremely difficult.",

Therefore, the assays are not specific for B. pertussis and alternative targets must be tested to differentiate the three species and also to detect B. parapertussis [89, 190, 216, 225]. Additionally, pseudo-outbreaks of pertussis have been described, indicating that great caution must be used not only in performing the NAAT but also in the collection of test samples, particularly in areas where vaccine is administered. Finally, due to the short time of localization of the atypical bacterial pathogens to the URT, the detection of these pathogens may require a combination of various sample types and various test methods, including NAATs, serology, and antigen testing, to provide the most sensitive results.",

            "text": "The advantages of NAATs compared with traditional testing methods include improved sensitivity, not needing a viable organism for detection, broader scope of pathogens identified, and the ability to detect mixed infections. These same advantages can also raise issues with the interpretation of results. Until recently the detection of any respiratory virus had been considered significant. Several studies have shown that respiratory viruses can be detected in asymptomatic patients [2, 14, 104, 181]. One study found that NAATs identified a virus in 83 % of specimens from symptomatic children, but also detected a virus in 42 % of specimens from children without symptoms [2]. Another study demonstrated similar colonization with CoV (7.6 %) in symptomatic hospitalized children versus (7.1 %) in an asymptomatic outpatient control population. The overall prevalence of CoV or the types of CoV was not significantly higher among hospitalized children than controls. Respiratory viruses in NP swabs were identified from both asymptomatic and symptomatic solid organ transplant recipients early after transplantation [14]. The data suggest that due to the high prevalence of positive results in children and immunocompromised patients without symptoms, results should be interpreted cautiously, and in the context of clinical presentation, radiographic findings, and other laboratory tests. Additionally, clinicians must be aware that NAATs will detect nucleic acids lingering from a previous infection and that samples submitted for assessment of therapeutic response may remain positive for days to weeks after treatment due to the presence of nonviable organisms and not due to treatment failure. In these situations culture or quantitative NAATs (see Future Directions below) may provide the best option. With the increased use of highly multiplexed respiratory virus assays, a variety of mixed viral infections are detected and the clinical importance of each virus is not always evident. Nonviable virus from a previous infection may be detected, making it impossible to determine which or if all viruses contribute to the current illness. Test reports need to explain what viruses are included in the NAAT panel, sensitivity and specificity of the test, and that a negative result does not preclude infection with a specific pathogen due to many factors that can lead to decreased assay sensitivity.",

Are quantitative assays necessary or can assay cut off values be established at clinically relevant thresholds? (2) How many pathogens need to be included in a screening test? The detection of the broad scope of potential gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens is limited by multiplexing capabilities. Should these assays detect at a minimum those pathogens with the highest clinical impact or those difficult to treat? (3) How can we detect a broad range of resistance mechanisms, some of which do not have genetic markers (such as porin down-regulation in Pseudomonas spp.)? (4) Can we trust a positive result to direct antibiotic therapy? (5) Can we trust a negative result when there is the possibility of the presence of unknown resistance mechanisms?

For example, how do we interpret a result positive for a specific resistance gene when we do not detect the organism in which it would reside? (7) Will this type of testing provide actionable results, i.e., will this change clinical practice?

Controls should be tested in accordance with regulatory requirements as outlined by CLIA, CAP, and state or other federal regulatory agencies, and in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Ideally all controls should go through the same process as the patient sample. ICs are best added at the NA extraction step to ensure efficient recovery of NAs. ICs added after extraction will just confirm the amplification efficiency and an external extraction control must be used unless the extraction method has demonstrated negligible inhibition (generally <1 %) for the sample types tested. During amplification and detection, the IC is essential to demonstrate a lack of amplification failure or decreased efficiency. External positive and negative controls (not provided in the kit) must be used to verify each new lot and/or shipment of reagents. Each analyte of the multiplex must be verified individually in either a single reaction or as a component of a pooled control. Daily positive (individual or pooled) and negative controls must be run thereafter if batch testing is performed. Rotating controls after lot/shipment validation is acceptable. Tests using a single unit cartridge/pouch that contain a procedural control (IC or process control) do not require external controls to be run with each individual cartridge/pouch once the performance of the procedural control has been verified. External positive controls for each analyte and negative controls are only required for verification of each new lot/shipment or at a minimum once per month.",

Quantitative detection of viral respiratory pathogens can help to assess the dynamics of viral proliferation, better understand viral pathogenesis, and permits a means to evaluate the significance of coinfections. Since NAATs detect both viable and nonviable virus, monitoring patients for treatment response with qualitative testing provides little information as tests may remain positive for days even with successful therapy. Quantitative tests that demonstrate a decline in viral load during therapy more accurately assess patient response (Fig. 52.3a) and the failure to see a decline (Fig. 52.3b) would potentially indicate earlier a need to consider alternative therapies. This information is especially important for critically ill patients and immunosuppressed patients. Finally, viral load assays provide important information in the assessment of new antiviral agents in FDA clinical trials. Future assay development should consider quantification of the viral targets.\n",

            "text": "Antiviral resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors can be assessed both phenotypically and genotypically [84, 161, 187]. Neuraminidase inhibition assays detect decreases in susceptibility by determining the 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC50). However, these assays require growth of the virus and the presence of quasi-species can lead to unreliable results. Alternatively, genotypic assays are easier and identify known resistance mutations. However, newly identified mutations require phenotypic confirmation. Although no molecular assays are FDA-cleared for influenza resistance testing, several methods are used including traditional Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, PCR genotyping assays, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) [84, 161]. Pyrosequencing is currently the method of choice since the method is fast, has a high throughput, is sensitive (can detect a mutation if present in 10 % of the population), can assess multiple known mutations (e.g., H275Y mutation found in resistant H1N1-2009 strains) as well as unknown mutations and polymorphisms [52\u201354]. NGS has the added advantage of generating longer sequence lengths and has identified new genetic mutations associated with neuraminidase resistance. Laboratories should consider offering resistance testing in seasons where circulating strains may have varying resistance patterns (for example, H1N1 in 2007\u20132008 that demonstrated variable oseltamivir susceptibility), especially for patients at high risk to develop severe disease (e.g., pregnant or immunosuppressed) [38]. In addition, screening for resistance is indicated in seriously ill patients who continue to shed virus and are not clinically improving after prolonged antiviral therapy.",

Already NGS is used to detect and identify respiratory pathogens, resistance and pathogenicity markers, genetically characterize viruses, explore the respiratory microbiome, and understand the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens [169].
