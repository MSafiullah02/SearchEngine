This paper evaluates the uptake of the public health message in a WNv hot spot (2002) in order to assess the determinants of the likelihood of undertaking personal protective behaviours to reduce the risk of illness from WNv.",

[4] [5] [6] As of 2005, there were 2,470 human cases of WNv infection reported to CDC for 2004. 5 In Canada, 1,335 human cases were reported in 2003. 6 In Canada, the increase in human cases has coincided with the spread of the disease westward across the country. In 2002, the Province of Ontario in central Canada contained over 90% of confirmed f human cases; one year later, the majority of human cases were confirmed in the western Prairie provinces. 7 The virus is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. Culex pipiens, an urban-dwelling mosquito, is an important vector that breeds in underground standing water found in city drains and catch basins. During a long, hot summer, these water sources become even richer in the rotting organic material that Culex needs for survival; concomitantly, these climatic conditions can also lead to a decline in mosquito predators (e.g., frogs).",

Survey data are used to explore attitudes, risk perceptions, and prevention behaviours undertaken. Adams et al. 10 used survey data to explore knowledge, attitudes and behaviours around West Nile virus in Connecticut, where an outbreak had occurred in 2002. The majority (77%) of these respondents (n=1791) sometimes or always used at least one PPB, while only 15% never used any PPBs. These reported levels of risk reduction must be contextualized, however, by the fact that this area had a 15-year track record of public health messaging because of Lyme disease. In contrast, the present study was performed soon after the first introduction of WN virus into Canada, in a region where public health messaging about protection against insects was novel.",

With respect to the determinants of these behaviours, Adams et al. 10 discovered a similar picture: using insect repellent was significantly associated with being less than 50 years old, being worried about getting WNv, and spending time outdoors in the evening. Using 2+ PPBs was associated with being female and being worried about getting WNv. Herrington, 15 in a national US survey of 1,750 adults, found that the most robust predictor of behavioural action to prevent mosquito bites was worry about being bitten by an infected mosquito (OR 7.3; 95% CI = 4.3-12.2).",

There are several potential explanations for this. First, the data are based on self-report and could be biased toward a socially-desirable response. Second, 73% of respondents reported receiving their WN virus information from the media, yet the media has been criticized for lack of accurate reporting of environmental health risk issues in general 16 and WN virus in particular. 17 Third, the message was not delivered clearly and/or not well understood. This seems unlikely, though, as indicated by the relatively high socio-economic status of the study population as well as the fact that indeed 78% reported at least one PPB. Fourth, the risk was simply not seen as such by the general population. Given the high levels of awareness and concern, however, this explanation is not likely.",

Pour lutter contre le VNO, les professionnels de la sant\u00e9 publique recommandent diverses mesures de protection individuelle qui r\u00e9duisent le risque de morsures de moustiques (porter des v\u00eatements de protection, s'enduire d'insecticide lorsqu'on est dehors au lever ou au coucher du soleil) ou qui \u00e9liminent les g\u00eetes \u00e0 larves de moustiques (emp\u00eacher la formation d'eaux stagnantes, nettoyer p\u00e9riodiquement les goutti\u00e8res). Nous \u00e9valuons ici l'acceptation du message de sant\u00e9 publique dans une zone sensible au VNO (2002) afin d'\u00e9valuer les d\u00e9terminants de la probabilit\u00e9 de prendre des mesures de protection individuelle pour r\u00e9duire le risque de contracter le VNO. M\u00e9thode : Une enqu\u00eate t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique a \u00e9t\u00e9 administr\u00e9e \u00e0 un \u00e9chantillon al\u00e9atoire d'adultes (n=1 650) vivant dans les r\u00e9gions de tri d'acheminement L6L et L6K d'Oakville (Ontario), au Canada.",

And the experience has much to teach us about emerging health threats. The takehome message from public and other health officials is consistent: public education is key. 3, 12, 19 And further, not only is it important to disseminate the message, it is essential to evaluate its uptake to ensure the message is heeded.",
