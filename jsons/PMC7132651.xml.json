The following terms were utilized as keyword searches: infection control, infection prevention, disaster, mass casualties, bioterrorism, pandemic, disaster planning, and emergency management. Only English language articles in peer-reviewed journals were utilized; articles that described hospital, community, or noninfection prevention professional preparedness were excluded unless they addressed some aspect of the IP's role in emergency management. Seven hundred eighty-four references were identified and reviewed for relevance; most were eliminated based on the title or journal (nonpeer reviewed or did not meet inclusion criteria) alone. Three hundred sixty-six references were screened by reading the abstract. Of those screened, 21 articles were deemed relevant and were analyzed in their entirety. In addition, 13 Internet sources were used.",

The preparedness phase involves all of the measures taken to prepare for an emergency, such as developing an emergency management plan and educating the workforce. The response phase occurs after disaster strikes when the plan developed in the preparedness phase is implemented. The recovery phase of the emergency management model consists of the interventions needed to return a facility and/or community to its predisaster baseline as soon as possible. Other mass casualty incident-related topics with which IPs must be familiar include surge capacity, responding agencies' roles in emergency management, incident command system, environmental concerns in the physical plant, occupational health during disasters, and prioritizing limited resources that may affect infection transmission.6\n",

Infection prevention-related aspects of the emergency management plan are only a small piece of the overall plan, but these issues require IP input to guide decision making. Various researchers have outlined strategies for assessing emergency management plans,43, 44, 45 including an appendix in the APIC Bioterrorism Readiness Planning Suggestions document.9 However, these assessment guides address all components of an emergency management plan, most of which do not require input from an IP. Examples would include information on how the hospital will address implementation activities required for adoption of the National Incident Management System (NIMS), development and evaluation of the emergency management plan, implementation of a staff education program related to emergency management, and set-up of an emergency operations center at the facility.43, 44, 45 IPs would only be expected to address components of the facility emergency management plan that pertain to preventing or controlling the spread of disease, although IPs should be familiar with the findings from their facility and community hazard vulnerability assessments.11, 12, 13 Some components of an emergency management plan that require IP input have been outlined, including surveillance, triage, patient placement, and isolation.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 25, 26, 32, 38, 39 Although a comprehensive list of topics that require IP input have not been delineated in the literature, some issues that may affect infection transmission during disasters are listed in Table 1\n. It is important that every health care facility have an IP as a member of the emergency management planning team to consult on issues that affect infection transmission in the health care setting during mass casualty events.9, 10, 12, 13, 27, 29, 31, 37, 39\n",

Examples of resources that may have an impact on infectious disease spread include personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene products, antiinfective therapy, environmental decontamination products, patient linens, and isolation rooms/areas.9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 39 It is anticipated that resources will be limited or unavailable during a mass casualty event, especially one involving an infectious agent such as a bioterrorism attack or a pandemic. Health care emergency management planning teams will need to make difficult decisions regarding how to allocate scare resources, and the potential infectious disease implications of these decisions must be taken into account.11, 12, 13, 16, 29, 39 IP input will be vital in developing prioritization plans for therapy, prophylaxis, and vaccination when doses are limited9, 11, 12, 13, 26, 39; allocation of PPE when resources are insufficient or unavailable6, 11, 12, 13, 16, 26, 29, 37, 39; and safe patient placement when isolation rooms are depleted.6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 25, 35, 37, 38, 39\n",

Community disaster planners will need infection prevention guidance when setting up and running alternative care sites and shelters for displaced individuals.6, 14, 28 Alternative care sites are needed for all events involving mass casualties in which the affected community needs to deliver medical care outside the traditional health care system.6, 14, 28, 40, 45 Alternative care sites may consist of a hotel, closed hospital, converted warehouse, school, sports arena, convention center, or any building or space that is adapted for providing medical care.46 Community shelters are buildings/areas used to house displaced individuals during a mass casualty incident and can range from a small evacuation center to a large sports arena.39 The level of medical treatment provided at alternative care sites and community shelters will vary by the community and the size/scope of the event. Because health care staff and/or volunteers will deliver medical care at these sites, the risk of infection transmission exists. Therefore, it is essential that both alternative care sites and shelters have an infection prevention program to prevent the spread of infectious organisms.6, 14, 28 This will require having IPs involved in community emergency management planning before an event and perhaps serving as a consultant during a mass casualty incident if resources allow.",

In addition to hospitals, it is important that long-term care, home health, alternative care sites, and community shelters have infection control coverage.14, 17, 19, 39, 40 Because of limited resources during a disaster, infection prevention coverage in nonhospital settings may need to be assigned to an infection prevention designee.6, 28, 39 If an infection prevention designee is to be used, this individual or group of workers should receive training in infection prevention principles and practice before a disaster. In addition, an IP should be involved or consulted when setting up the infection prevention program for all health care settings to ensure that appropriate standards are implemented, even if an infection prevention designee will be responsible for managing the program during a disaster.39 Identifying IP coverage and/or infection prevention designee(s) for nonhospital settings should be coordinated with local health care facilities and public health communicable disease officials who may be aware of additional local/regional resources to assist.39\n",

Rapid notification of the IP during any type of disaster is vital so that proper assessments can be made concerning the potential infectious disease implications of the event.

Tough decisions need to be made regarding how to allocate limited numbers of ventilators or medications, where contagious patients will be housed if all isolation rooms are full, and which staff will be given PPE if stocks become depleted. Some of these decisions will have infectious disease implications and require IP input to determine the best course of action. Facility disaster planning teams and ethics committees will be responsible for development of crisis standards of care. IP's responsibility in this process is to consult with these teams and committees to create the most protective crisis standards of care possible in relation to preventing the spread of infectious organisms in health care settings. To this end, IPs should be involved in all policy development decisions that have potential infectious disease implications. Examples of such decisions include which staff will care for potentially infectious patients, how and when to cohort potentially contagious patients, prioritization plans for limited supplies of antiinfective therapy for staff, what to do when hand hygiene or environmental decontamination supplies become insufficient, and how PPE will be allocated or reused if resources become depleted. Researchers and national organizations have begun work in this area, such as the development of guidelines on how to safely reuse respiratory protection when resources become insufficient or unavailable,16 but more needs to be done.",

IPs should also be involved in developing protocols related to staff immunization, including seasonal influenza, smallpox, and other vaccines.10, 37 Another occupational health emergency management policy with which IPs should be involved is the development of protocols for designating staff limited to work with infected patients.13, 16, 25, 29, 39 This process includes both patient and health care worker cohorting procedures to decrease the risk of infection spread and maximize staff resources.29\n",

Syndromic surveillance systems are often regional or state-wide programs managed by public health authorities, and all health care facilities may be mandated to collect the same indicators.10 IPs may not need to help design these programs but should participate if requested.

As mentioned previously, limited resources may necessitate the use of crisis standards of care for patient management. In addition, some patient management issues are unique to infectious disease disasters. One patient management issue that is unique to infectious disease disasters is quarantine. Quarantine would only be needed for the most potentially severe infectious diseases, such as smallpox and SARS, and may not be implemented at all.12 If quarantine were implemented, it would likely be in the form of a community- or home-based system. However, hospital-based quarantines have been implemented in the past and remain a possibility for future infectious disease disasters.10, 49 Patient decontamination to remove biologic particles is another patient management issue that is unique to infectious disease disasters. For most mass casualty incidents, patient decontamination will not be necessary or will only be needed to remove chemical or other toxic agents; these issues do not require IP input. Patient decontamination to remove biologic particles is an infection prevention issue because these contaminates can lead to secondary disease spread if they are not removed in a timely and appropriate manner. IPs need to aid health care facility and community disaster planners develop protocols for when and how patient decontamination to remove biologic particles should be performed.11, 12, 13, 39 Patient decontamination to remove biologic particles is only needed after an announced bioterrorism attack occurs and then only if the event is known within 12 to 24 hours after the exposure.11\n",

Competencies for hospital-based health care workers related to infection prevention have been developed54 but do not currently exist for other worker groups. These competencies should be used for education development for hospital-based health care workers and may serve as a starting point for creating training for other worker groups. Competency domains for hospital-based health care workers include basic microbiology, modes/mechanisms of infection transmission, standard and transmission-based precautions, occupational health, patient safety, critical thinking, and emergency preparedness.54 Within the emergency preparedness domain, additional education topics have been identified. Education topics that IPs need to cover when developing training materials for staff, patients, and visitors are outlined in Table 4\n. Examples of such topics include how and when to perform hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, isolation precautions, PPE use, safely reuse respiratory protection, and screening procedures. Most of these topics are applicable for routine practice; differences between day-to-day activities and disaster situations need to be incorporated into the training. For instance, routine PPE use and procedures for safely reusing respiratory protection when resources are insufficient or depleted because of a disaster need to be included in staff education.16 In addition, educational material needs to be targeted to each group. Previous research indicates that there are discipline-specific competencies related to infection prevention.54 IPs should take these differences into account when education is created for various groups of individuals. During response to a mass casualty incident, all responding staff will require some level of training that is specific to the event. Whenever possible, IPs should have \u201cjust in time\u201d training materials on hand to distribute during disaster response.6\n",
