It acts not only as a principal site for posttranslational modifications, folding, oligomerization of the newly synthesized membrane and secretory proteins, but also as a major signal transduction compartment in the cell. Perturbations in the ER homeostasis will initiate an ER stress response pathway, which is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human (Harding et al., 2002, Kaufman et al., 2002). ER stress may be divided into two classes: unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-overload response (EOR). The former is represented by a marked increase in ER-localized proteins such as glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78/BiP) or 94 (Grp94). The latter is characterized by activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway.",

We have shown that Tula virus-induced apoptosis is caspase-mediated and can be blocked by a broad caspase peptide inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (Li et al., 2004). In that study, we observed that activated caspase-8 started to appear on the fourth day post-infection (p.i.). However, the questions remained, how does caspase-8 get activated and where do the signals come from. Taking into account the prominent role of ER in the replication of Tula virus, we tested several known players that are associated with ER stress. Caspase-12 is known as an ER-resident caspase that may cooperate with caspase-8 during ER stress (Lamkanfi et al., 2004, Nakagawa et al., 2000). Therefore, we thought that caspase-12 is another likely candidate to activate the Tula hantavirus-induced caspase cascade. Fig. 1\nshows that caspase-12 was cleaved evidently from the inactive pro-enzyme to the active one starting on the third day p.i., which was at least 1 day earlier than the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. This indicates that caspase-12 might be the initiator caspase responsible for transduction of the death signal from the ER.",

            "text": "It is known that activation of the JNK pathway is required for apoptosis in certain circumstances (Takeda et al., 2003). In response to ER stress, the JNK pathway is activated through the complex of IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1 (Nishitoh et al., 2002). In view of the pivotal role of JNK in apoptosis and ER stress, we were prompted to investigate its role in the model of Tula virus-induced cell death. In Vero E6 cells the endogenous expression of JNK (1 and 2) is relatively high (Fig. 2A, lower). Tula virus infection led to apparent phosphorylation of JNK1, and to a much less extent also JNK2 on the fifth day p.i., as also confirmed by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) treatment (Fig. 2A, upper), but the level of the non-phosphorylated form of JNKs remained almost unchanged. We further analyzed a major downstream substrate of JNK, c-jun. Interestingly, we noticed that the endogenous level of c-jun was undetectable in mock-treated control Vero E6 cells. However, as the infection proceeded, both forms of c-jun, the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated, were dramatically increased (Fig. 2B). This can be explained by that phosphorylated JNK1 stabilizes c-jun after a stress. In contrast, JNK2 destabilizes c-jun protein for degradation under the non-stimulating conditions (Ronai, 2004, Sabapathy et al., 2004). Furthermore, the importance of activation of JNK pathway on induction of apoptosis was confirmed by the observation of reduced PARP cleavage after adding JNK inhibitor II (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that activation of the JNK pathway may contribute significantly to the Tula virus-induced apoptosis in Vero E6 cells.",

            "text": "BAP31, a ubiquitously expressed integral ER-membrane protein, regulates apoptosis through association with Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or pro-caspase-8. NH2-terminal membrane embedded fragment p20 is a cleavage product of BAP31 by activated caspase-8 in response to extrinsic apoptotic stimuli via death receptor such as TNF-R1. Prolonged expression of p20 fragment alone is enough to induce caspase activation and apoptosis through mitochondria-mediated pathway (Breckenridge et al., 2003, Ng and Shore, 1998, Ng et al., 1997). It is interesting to point out that in the kidney, BAP31 staining was prominent in the proximal tubules while glomeruli were BAP31-negative (Manley and Lennon, 2001). The clinical findings in HFRS and HPS patients suggest that tubuli are the most affected region in the kidney. Here we sought to evaluate the role of BAP31 in the Tula virus-infected Vero E6 cells. Both the full-length and p20 fragment of BAP31 were down-regulated and readily detectable by mouse monoclonal antibody (8DIIE) and rabbit polyclonal antibody throughout the time course of Tula virus infection (Fig. 4\n). In addition, a novel protein band migrating at about 10 kDa was recognized by the rabbit polyclonal antibody against BAP31. It is worthwhile to note that the time course of appearance of this band correlated well with the activation of caspase-8, as already shown in Fig. 1. So, these results indicate that the dramatic change of BAP31 protein may play a critical role in Tula virus-induced apoptosis.",

To test this hypothesis, we sought for the evidence on ER stress by analyzing the Tula virus-infected Vero E6 cell lysates that were collected at different time points. In Fig. 5A, we demonstrate that Tula hantavirus infection induced the production of Grp78/BiP protein more specifically than other stress factors like Grp94, protein disulfide bond isomerase (PDI), calreticulin, or the cytosolic chaperone HSP70. Grp78/BiP started to increase on the third day and reached its peak on the seventh day p.i. This correlated with the progressive viral replication shown by immunoblot against the nucleocapsid protein of Tula virus (Fig. 5A). Grp78/BiP is generally considered an ER-stress marker protein that is regulated at the transcriptional level. As expected, Grp78/BiP mRNA was elevated following infection shown by conventional RT-PCR (Fig. 5B) and real-time PCR (Fig. 5C). In addition, to rule out additional factors other than virus replication itself for the sustained ER-chaperone induction, we used UV-inactivated virus, as well as ribavirin and interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1), efficient antiviral agents against hantaviruses in vitro and in vivo (Severson et al., 2003). In the absence of viral replication with UV radiation, we could not see the induction of Grp78/BiP (data not shown). Similarly, decreasing viral replication by treatment of Vero E6 cells with either ribavirin or IFN-\u03b1 reduced the level of BiP/Grp78 (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data suggest that progressive replication is required for Tula virus-induced ER stress and that Tula virus-infection induces up-regulation of Grp78/BiP in Vero E6 cells.",

To some extent, this has limited our efforts to understand molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of HFRS and HPS. We sought to approach this issue by utilizing a recently discovered model on Tula virus-induced apoptosis of Vero E6 cells (Li et al., 2004). We now show that the replication of Tula virus is able to induce ER-stress response marked by the increased expression of ER-located chaperone Grp78/BiP. Multiple downstream apoptotic signaling pathways are subsequently activated and ultimately lead to death of all infected Vero E6 cells by apoptosis. Here, a model is suggested in Fig. 6\nto summarize the Tula virus-induced ER stress-signaling pathway. We propose that misfolding hantavirus glycoproteins lead to ER stress. Its seems possible that the programs downstream of ER stress may involve pathways operating not only in initiation and execution of apoptosis, but also in a proinflammatory response.",

            "text": "ER-stress signaling is initiated from ER lumen by unfolded or misfolded proteins. Generally speaking, protein misfolding is a fact of life (Kopito, 2000). This may be especially true for many enveloped RNA viruses for which the ER serves as the primary site of replication. In order to maximize production of viral proteins, viruses must demand coordinated ER function, but they also have to cope with the ER-stress response of host cells. Envelope glycoproteins encoded by Flaviviridae such as Japanese encephalitis virus, HCV, and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) can accumulate to huge amounts in the lumen of ER (Jordan et al., 2002, Su et al., 2002, Tardif et al., 2002). It has been shown that overexpression of enveloped viral components alone in cultured cells is enough to induce ER stress-mediated apoptosis (Kalkeri et al., 2001, Liberman et al., 1999). Moreover, HCV envelope proteins exist as high molecular weight aggregates that are not recognized by conformation-specific antibodies, suggesting that they exist in nonnative conformations (Choukhi et al., 1999). Currently, at least three lines of evidence indicate that there may exist a significant amount of misfolded Gn protein of hantavirus within infected cells. Firstly, it has been noticed for a long time that the Gn protein of hantavirus tends to aggregate into a high molecular weight complex which is prominent in SDS-containing buffer (Ruusala et al., 1992, Spiropoulou et al., 2003, Vapalahti et al., 1996). Secondly, mature Gn and Gc proteins surprisingly remain in the high mannose type of glycosylation and associate with the ER chaperones calnexin and calreticulin, an implication of the failure in passing quality control (Shi and Elliott, 2004). Since Gn is hardly found on the plasma membrane, these findings suggest the possibility that a significant portion of misfolded Gn protein is retained on the way from ER, ER\u2013Golgi intermediate, to cis\u2013Golgi (Shi et al., 2004). It has also been suggested that even the misfolded protein can move to ER\u2013Golgi intermediate and to cis\u2013Golgi and recycle back to ER in complex with Grp78/BiP (Hammond and Helenius, 1994). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the maturation of hantavirus might be regulated by signals emanated from the ER lumen where unfolded or unassembled viral glycoproteins are present.",

For example, caspase-12 has recently been linked with inflammatory and innate immune response to endotoxins (Saleh et al., 2004); it is well known that JNK activation of transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) through phosphorylation of c-jun is required for expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, and IFN-\u03b3 (Bennett et al., 2001, Foletta et al., 1998), in which TNF-\u03b1 is an important mediator in HFRS (Linderholm et al., 1996, Temonen et al., 1996); Gadd153/chop is directly responsible for up-regulation of IL-6 (Hattori et al., 2003), which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HFRS and HPS (Linderholm et al., 1996, M\u00e4kel\u00e4 et al., 2004). Our observation of the induction of Gadd153/chop by Tula virus infection may provide a cellular mechanism for IL-6 production. Further studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between hantavirus and maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In summary, we think that our present findings in this report should provide new approaches to understand the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of hantavirus infections.",
