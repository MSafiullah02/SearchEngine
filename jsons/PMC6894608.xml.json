Around the world, the diversity, and frequency, of infectious outbreaks is rising over time [1,2], with an estimated 10 000 viruses with zoonotic potential that are emerging at a slow but accelerating pace [3,4]. Intensifying pathways of contact between wildlife reservoirs and humans, and the rapid spread of new pathogens among human populations around the globe are considered major drivers in this accelerating process [5,6]. Changes in climate and land use, as well as food insecurity and geopolitical conflict, are expected to exacerbate feedbacks between socio-ecological change and emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). In the face of these threats, the long-standing need to anticipate disease emergence events remains an elusive challenge for public health research [7]. Given the rise in global infectious disease outbreak events [2], understanding the factors which promote outbreak and emergence events is a primary public health concern.",

Different classes of emerging pathogens (e.g. new pathogens versus drug-resistant strains of familiar ones; vector-borne and/or zoonotically transmitted diseases) follow different spatial risk patterns at a global scale [1]. In part, this can be explained by the non-random distribution of host groups that disproportionately contribute to zoonotic emergence events, like bats and rodents [9,10], and are likely to continue to do so [11\u201313]. However, additional factors are strongly associated with the distribution of emerging infection risk; notably human population density, land cover and land use change [8], as well as a broader array of social, cultural and economic factors [14\u201318].",

However, with increasing global connectivity, both pathogens and the free-living organisms that host them are spreading around the world at an accelerating rate, and consequently, aspects of the spatial structure of pathogen diversity are becoming less pronounced. One study examining a global pathogen\u2013country network showed that modularity is decreasing while connectance is increasing over time: pathogen ranges are on average expanding, and over time, geographically separate regions are facing more similar threats [21,22]. This biotic homogenization has critical implications for public health, as known diseases can become unfamiliar problems in novel locations, or can re-emerge in landscapes from which they were previously eradicated.",

Some recent work has examined the predictability of disease outbreak dynamics as it relates to pathogen characteristics like R0 [23], but this has been studied less in spatial frameworks, and often focuses on more common outbreak events than attempting to forecast emergence events. Some forecasting approaches exist that use dozens of layers ranging from human mobility to healthcare access [24,25], but for a newly emerging disease, it may be hard to gather these mechanistic predictors, let alone anticipate which will be relevant. As an alternative method, a recent study by Murray et al. delineated biogeographic regions based on the popular GIDEON dataset and proposed prediction based on the principle that countries that currently share more pathogens should be more likely targets during a pathogen\u2019s future outbreaks [20]. This \u2018co-zone\u2019 concept shows promise as a simple way of applying ecological concepts to disease forecasting, especially if data on community structure can be built into models designed with machine learning to be explicitly predictive.",

We use a similarity-based approach combined with a regression approach previously used for species distribution modelling called plug-and-play, in order to forecast country -pathogen associations through time. Unlike more mechanistic approaches that simulate pathogen spread by human mobility, our model does not explicitly consider country or pathogen identity and further does not use the information on spatial structure, or trait information of countries or pathogens. Instead, the model ranks the \u2018suitability\u2019 of links (an unscaled measure of link likelihood) based only on the dissimilarity of pathogens\u2019 distribution and countries\u2019 pathogen community. The approach therefore lets us test the baseline predictability of the network, including how many training years are needed to make accurate predictions, and how far into the future predictions are accurate (the forecast horizon [26]).",

While both may be driven by genetic shifts in pathogens or changing land use patterns enhancing transmission risk, re-emergence events are more likely to be related to weakened healthcare infrastructure, prematurely terminated eradication campaigns [27,28] or low detection of long-term persistence of environmental pathogen reservoirs (e.g. anthrax spores in the soil and permafrost; [29,30]).",

Diseases of zoonotic origin (i.e. with animal hosts) and with vector-borne transmission might be harder to predict due to hidden constraints on their distribution and more complicated outbreak dynamics than directly transmitted pathogens have. On the other hand, commonalities between species that share vectors or reservoir hosts might lead to similarities in distributions (a common notion in pathogen biogeography, as in how dengue models were frequently used in the early days of the Zika pandemic, given the shared vector Aedes aegypti; [31,32]). In this case, the community-based prediction could be more powerful for zoonotic and vector-borne diseases. Differential frequency of zoonotic and vector-borne transmission might also make different pathogen classes (viruses, bacteria, fungi and macroparasites) more or less predictable, as might different dispersal ability on a global scale, with respiratory viruses usually presumed to spread the fastest, and macroparasites generally treated as the most dispersal-limited. Understanding how the role of community structure changes for these different pathogens can help contextualize and tailor the methods we use to predict them.",

Lastly, emergence events were considered as the first record of a pathogen within a country. Given the scope of our data, a pathogen that emerged earlier than 1990, but appeared after would still be classified as an emergence event, as we only considered the 26-year period after 1990. We hypothesized that outbreaks and re-emergences should be more predictable than emergences; outbreak events occur repeatedly, providing not only ample data for model training but also a clear tendency of a pathogen to occur in a country. By contrast, emergence events are determined by many unique drivers [8], which may not be shared across any two given emergence events, and which we may need mechanistic predictors to capture.",

For every year and each combination of C and P, we have dissimilarity values for each country and pathogen, the product of their dissimilarities and the year of sampling (figure 1). The model functions by relating the probability density of these variables when a link is present (f1) between country and pathogen to the overall density of the features for all possible country\u2013pathogen pairs (f). In essence, the relationship between f1 and f (i.e. q = f1/f) represents the suitability of the country\u2013pathogen pair given the dissimilarity and year values made conditional upon all possible country\u2013pathogen pairs. That is, the dissimilarity and year values inform a measure akin to the potential for an outbreak event of a given pathogen to occur in a given country (i.e. the suitability for the event to occur). We estimate these suitability values (q) by separately estimating f1 and f using the non-parametric kernel density estimator npudens from the np R package [38].

A more compelling explanation is that this year was an anomalous result; transmission mode did not influence accuracy when hindcasting/forecasting (electronic supplementary material, figure S5) or when models were trained along a rolling window (figure 4), though there was notable year-to-year variation in the latter.",

The model was able to capture pathogen outbreak and re-emergence potential well, suggesting that, at least at broad spatial scales, pathogen outbreak and re-emergence events are both recurrent and predictable (and that community assembly is structured and predictive of outbreak potential). However, our model generally failed to forecast pathogen emergence events. This is largely unsurprising, as predicting when and where the next major public health threat will emerge is an incredibly difficult task which remains unsolved despite having received decades of attention [1,7,8]. However, the failure of community information to anticipate local emergences is still disappointing, especially given that biogeographic \u2018co-zones\u2019 could be useful strategic tools in the absence of knowledge about a newly described pathogen [17]. It remains possible that other formulations might be more successful (e.g. restricting the pathogen\u2013country matrix to a particular subset of closely related pathogens) or that community structure might improve model performance alongside more mechanistic predictors.",

In the 2016 model breakdown, bacteria were the most predictable while viruses were disproportionately unpredictable, as were zoonotic and vector-borne pathogens.

While pandemic spread may be predictable using detailed information on climate, human movement and local environmental suitability [7,42,43], our approach lacks these mechanistic predictors and is sensitive to these black swan events. This can be seen in reduced model performance during the 2009 flu pandemic, including for pathogens with no relationship to flu, although viruses and vector-borne pathogens are more severely affected (electronic supplementary material). So while the model benefits from pathogen community data, rare and widespread events can strongly reduce model accuracy.

This is in large part due to how time is used in the model: though year is a covariate, the model itself is not temporally explicit, meaning that the model can predict a certain link following on previous years, but it would be erroneous to interpret that as a forecast for a given point in time. However, the tool can be used to investigate pathogen outbreak and emergence potential under different pathogen range expansion scenarios. That is, by simulating pathogen spread into new geographical locations, the model could be used to identify potential pathogens that may also shift their geographical ranges. Since the method is based on dissimilarity of countries and pathogen distributions, it is possible to examine the expected outcome as pathogen distributions become more (or less) homogeneous, or countries become more (or less) dissimilar in their pathogen communities. Finally, the sensitivity of the model to pathogen shifts, transients or imperfect detection are all things that can be tested using simulation approaches and may provide further insight into our ability to forecast outbreak and emergence events.",

Our results show how a simple model considering the entire pathogen community captures important global geographical variation in outbreak potential, but as a stand-alone tool, still struggles to predict when a pathogen will first arrive in a new region. For this definition of emergence (and this dataset), we suggest this indicates an outer bound of predictive capacity based only on community structure; however, community data could be very easily leveraged alongside other socio-ecological predictors to forecast disease emergence as an ecosystem process rather than a single-species one.
