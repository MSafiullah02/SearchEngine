President Donald Trump declared a national emergency along with 50 governors declaring state emergencies. Social distancing and self-quarantine were advocated to flatten the epidemic curve in the hope of moderating the effects the virus may have had on the healthcare system, morbidity, and mortality. This directive caused grade schools, universities, parks, and any non-essential business to close. Some cities such as San Francisco have gone so far to make it a misdemeanor offense to leave home for non-essential purposes. These measures were put into place to prompt self-quarantine. The influence of self-quarantine on factors that impact weight change and obesity-related behaviors in adults is unknown.",

For example, a quick search of the term \"quarantine 15\" on Instagram and Facebook yields over 15,000 results. In addition to the lay population, researchers have suggested that self-quarantine may provoke depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and lifestyle behaviors that could provoke obesity in adults (6, 7) . Indeed, self-quarantine guidelines may provoke behaviors associated with weight gain and obesity. For example, although outdoor physical activity was still encouraged in some areas, it could be hypothesized that TV and screen time would increase during selfquarantine. Increased screen time in adults is a risk factor for obesity (8) . Additionally, mice placed in private housing gained more fat when compared to mice housed in groups (9) . In humans, social isolation has shown to be linked to increased leptin levels (10) .",

For example, researchers in 2013 (24) randomized 90 women into one of two weight loss groups. Both groups were assigned to a hypocaloric diet consisting of 1400 calories with similar macronutrient profiles. The only difference between the groups was that one consumed half of their daily caloric allotment for breakfast while the other consumed half for dinner. By the end of 12 weeks, the group that ate most of their calories for breakfast lost approximately 13 more pounds than the group that ate bigger dinners.

It is plausible that the decreased sleep and increased snacking after dinner go hand in hand to provoke weight gain. Indeed, the majority of sleep research points to the fact that decreasing sleep duration promotes obesity because of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f increased opportunities to eat (25, 26) . It is feasible that participants who reported less sleep ate more during the evening hours when they are awake. Lastly, hours spent in physical activity per week was another predictor of weight gain. Prior research supports this find as it is well established that exercise produces weight loss in a dose-response fashion (27) .",

Our findings collaborate with this review that sedentary time may not be a predictor of weight gain in adults.",

Indeed, at the time of data collection and manuscript preparation, stringent self-quarantine practices are still being practiced.

Currently, it is unknown if gained weight during quarantine will be lost after self-quarantine measures are reduced. Whether one is looking at weight gain in children over summer or in adults over the holidays, data suggests that those who gain weight during those times periods more than likely will not lose the gained weight (2, 29) . Thus, those who gained weight during self-quarantine may not return to pre-pandemic weight.",
