            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis and ranks as the second leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, after the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [1]. Although TB incidence and mortality rates have fallen globally, the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB continues to threaten decades of progress in global TB control. MDR-TB, with an estimated 450,000 incident cases in 2012, is defined as resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most powerful first-line anti-TB drugs. XDR-TB strains, which accounts for 9% of MDR-TB cases, are further generated when MDR-TB strains develop additional resistance to a fluoroquinolone and a second line injectable agent [2]. In addition, efforts to tackle MDR-TB are complicated by TB/HIV coinfections, which dramatically reduce host immunity and increase individuals' susceptibility to TB infection and reinfection, including with drug-resistant strains [3]. Malabsorption of anti-TB drugs, particularly rifampicin, in TB/HIV patients may also predispose them to acquisition of drug resistance [4]. Progress towards early diagnosis and the development of shorter, less toxic and more efficacious treatment regimens in MDR-TB is clearly a priority in the global management of TB.",

            "text": "Cationic host defense peptides (HDPs) are a diverse group of molecules produced by the innate immune system in response to infectious agents. They have recently been identified as a potential new class of anti-infectives for drug development, given their broad-spectrum activity through both direct bactericidal and adjunctive immunomodulatory actions [5]. The direct anti-microbial mechanism of HDPs is largely attributed to their ability to fold into amphiphilic structures with hydrophobic and cationic domains, facilitating physical interactions with the negatively charged bacterial cell membrane and in some cases, bacterial cell penetration to act on intracellular targets, leading to the disruption of membrane integrity and cellular processes, respectively [6]. Their aggregate actions on several components essential to bacterial cell survival thus make development of drug resistance much less likely [7], [8]. Rational design of directly anti-microbial peptides based on structure-function relationships has thus been widely employed to produce candidates with greater bactericidal efficiency, although often at the expense of safety, which may explain why most peptides are used topically in clinical trials. The adjunctive immunomodulatory actions of HDPs, on the other hand, have been demonstrated in animal models to be important for pathogen clearance via the regulation of chemotactic activities of dendritic and T-cells, and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to enhanced leukocyte recruitment to the site of infection [9]. Given their pleiotropic targets and effects and the lack of clear structural requirements for immunomodulation, rational design of immunomodulatory HDPs is relatively more challenging and lags behind the development of microbial HDPs. Nonetheless, immunomodulation is recognized as a highly effective strategy to combat MDR infections especially in immunocompromised patients, as the target of action is the immune system rather than the pathogen itself.",

            "text": "In the present study, we explored synthetic modifications of a clinically used immunomodulator, thymopentin (TP-5), to confer cationicity to mimic the dual immunomodulatory and anti-microbial effects of HDP. TP-5 is a synthetic pentapeptide consisting of five amino acids, Arg-Lys-Asp-Val-Tyr, that correspond to the 32\u201336 amino acid sequence of the thymus hormone thymopoietin Refs. [10], [11]. TP-5 reproduces the immunomodulatory activity of thymopoietin, which is responsible for thymocyte differentiation and maturation [10], [11]. Besides inducing the phenotypic differentiation of T precursor cells in vitro, TP-5 can regulate the expression of CD4 and CD8 cell surface markers on human thymocytes [11], [12]. With its ability to boost T-cell mediated immune response, TP-5 has been used in the clinical treatment of primary immunodeficiencies such as Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) [13], [14], [15], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [16], rheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. By conjugating TP-5 with six arginine amino acid residues at either the N- or C-termini, we obtained cationic peptide candidates that were evaluated for anti-mycobacterial activity by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), killing efficiency and time-kill measurements in drug-susceptible and drug\u2013resistant Mycobacterium smegmatis. Synergistic interactions were also determined by co-treatment of M. smegmatis with rifampicin and peptides via the chequerboard assay. A preliminary evaluation of the anti-microbial mechanism of the peptides was carried out using confocal and scanning electron microscopy and via their ability to induce leakage of an encapsulated fluorophore from large unilamellar vesicles composed of negatively charged phospholipids. Lastly, to confirm the retention of immunomodulatory activity in the modified peptides, we performed ELISA assays for the induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cells.",

Furthermore, peptide consisting of six or more arginine entered cells far more effectively than peptides of equal length containing lysine, ornithine or histidine. However, peptides of fewer than six amino acids were ineffective [33], [34]. Therefore, we engineered a short peptide composed of six arginine residues alone (RR-6) and this short peptide was capable of inducing pronounced growth inhibition of both rifampicin (RIF)-susceptible and RIF-resistant M. smegmatis with an MIC value of 125 mg/L (Table 1\n, Fig. S1). RIF-resistant M. smegmatis was developed by multiple treatments of drug-susceptible M. smegmatis with rifampicin at a sub-MIC concentration ((\u215b of MIC) and the MIC concentration of rifampicin increased from 7.81 mg/L to 500 mg/L (Fig. S2). As expected, TP-5 itself could not inhibit bacterial growthup to the highest concentration used (1000 mg/L). However, upon addition of six arginine residues at either C- or N-terminus of TP-5, the modified peptides, RR-11 and RY-11, became active against M. smegmatis at MIC similar to RR-6. In addition, killing efficiencies greater than 99.99% were achieved at respective MICs, suggesting a bactericidal effect of the peptides against RIF-susceptible and RIF-resistant M. smegmatis (Fig. S3). This effect was further validated using in vitro time-kill assays to analyze the fractional cell survival upon RR-11 peptide treatment at none, \u00bd\u00d7 MIC, MIC and 2\u00d7 MIC over 72 h Fig. 1\nshows that RR-11 was bactericidal (defined as \u22653 log10 decrease in the initial inoculum [35]) at 48 h at both MIC and 2\u00d7 MIC.

In contrast to the control group incubated with PBS alone, FITC-dextran gained entry into M. smegmatis readily after 10 min incubation with RR-11 to give a fluorescent signal, which becomes more intense with a longer incubation. The entry of the FITC dye indicated that the microbial cell membrane was damaged after the treatment with RR-11. These observations were supported by SEM visualization of cell lysis, which demonstrated the change of surface morphology in M. smegmatis from a rod-shaped structure with smooth surface to a flaccid and shrunken structure with distorted surfaces after 2 h incubation with RR-11 (250 mg/L) (Fig. 4\n).",

            "text": "Cationic peptides are considered as promising antibiotic candidates based on the fact that these peptides are less likely to develop drug resistance and have broad spectrum of activity. However, in spite of the advantages, the clinical usage is limited due to drawbacks such as poor potency, specificity and in vivo stability [36]. To overcome the shortcomings and translate laboratory discovery to the clinic, synergistic effect between peptides and traditional antibiotics can be applied as synergy can reduce the dose of each drug in combination, prevent drug resistance and result in greater antibacterial effect than the sum of the effects due to single agent [37], [38]. Rifampicin has been reported to act synergistically when administered in conjunction with anti-microbial peptides, possibly as a consequence of the peptide-mediated membrane disruption, which in turn enhances uptake of the drug [36], [39], [40]. To determine the interactions between RY-11 and rifampicin, synergy studies were performed using the chequerboard assays. Fig. 6\nshows that the minimum effective concentrations for each agent to be used in combination to achieve synergy in inhibiting the growth of M. smegmatis was \u00bc\u00d7 MIC of RY-11 and \u00bc\u00d7 MIC of rifampicin. The calculated FICI value was 0.5. Time-kill studies were performed to validate the synergistic effect. Fig. 7\nshows that rifampicin and RY-11 used alone as a single agent at \u00bc\u00d7 MIC could not inhibit the growth of M. smegmatis, while their combination successfully inhibited the bacterial growth. Synergy was defined as \u22652 log10 decrease in CFU/ml by the drug combination when compared to its most active constituent [35]. Synergistic activity was observed for combination group at 48 h and 72 h, confirmed by the reduction in viable colony counts of >2 log10 as compared to the single most active constituent.",

Fig. 8\nshows that after repeated treatments of rifampicin at \u215b\u00d7 MIC concentration, M. smegmatis became resistant to rifampicin as early as passage 2 and the MIC against M. smegmatis rose dramatically by approximately 30 fold by passage 10. In contrast, RR-11 and RY-11 remained equally active from passage 1 to 10, as demonstrated by the maintenance of MIC value throughout.

Hence, to address the retention of biological activity of TP-5 in the modified peptides RR-11 and RY-11, ELISA assays were performed to measure and compare the level of TNF-\u03b1 released after peptide treatment in RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells. The amount of TNF-\u03b1 released did not differ between the peptides although the levels were comparable to that released in response to LPS stimulation of the macrophages (p > 0.05) (Fig. 9\n). These levels were significantly higher than when the peptides were absent in the cell media (p < 0.001). Our results show that despite the structural modifications, the biological activity of TP-5 remained unperturbed in RR-11 and RY-11. Notably, it has been reported that TNF-\u03b1 is essential in controlling TB infection [42]. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients who were also latently infected with M. tuberculosis, the approach to counteract the increased serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 with TNF-\u03b1-neutralizing agents such as infliximab has led to TB reactivation [43], [44]. The ability to induce TNF-\u03b1 production specifically in our modified peptides may thus complement their anti-mycobacterial actions for a more effective therapeutic management of TB.",

Mechanistic investigations using dye leakage assays and microscopy reveal that the modified peptides function via membranolytic actions, which may account for their synergistic actions with the first-line anti-TB drug rifampicin. Despite the structural modifications, hemolysis hence toxicity is kept low and the biological activity of TP-5 is well retained as indicated by its ability to stimulate TNF-\u03b1 production in macrophages.
