We propose a method to enhance processing large amounts of collected samples. The method is based on mixing samples in testing tubes in a specific configuration, as opposed to testing single samples in each tube, and accounting for natural virus amounts in infected patients from variation of positiveness in test tubes. To illustrate the efficiency of the suggested method we carry out numerical tests for actual scenarios under various tests. Applying the proposed method enhances the number of tests by order of magnitudes, where all positives are identified with no false negatives, and the effective testing time can be reduced drastically even when the uncertainty in the test is relatively high.",

For example in the UK 25,000 tests were carried out in the period since January 2020 and up until March 11, 2020, which is equivalent to the number of tests carried out in South Korea in two and half days according to the World Health Organization. Thus, while in some countries there is a (front-end) problem of sample collection, in other countries the main concern is in processing the collected samples (backend problem). Here we are concerned with the back-end problem, namely processing a large amounts of collected samples.",

In this work, we propose an advanced testing method where samples from each patient are mixed in multiple tubes in a unique configuration, then variation of test \"positiveness\" of each tube are employed in order to calculate all possible positives. The first part of the method is by itself powerful when the percentage of infected patients is extremely low, as long as proper mixing is done -keeping in mind the dilution threshold (due to mixing) required for identifying the disease. However, as the percentage of the infected increases it becomes much more challenging to determine positives without performing new tests. To this end, an accurate quantitative approach (the second part of the proposed method) can be employed to determine all positives without risking having false negatives. For this part to be effective, an accurate method for quantification of PCR is required 5 . The proposed method takes into account the uncertainty (error) in the test. Even when the uncertainty increases (i.e. for less accurate tests), all positives are still obtained with no false negatives, though false positives start to arise as well. The mathematical model of the proposed method is presented in the following section.",

Note that this can be the case only when elements inR are identical, within the test uncertainty \u2206R.

Unfortunately, current technology is associated with a degree of uncertainty that requires optimising the solution using other factors such as tube set size m, and subset l. The smaller the percentage of infected patients, the higher the percentage of negatives identified (figure 1). As the uncertainty increases, the size of subset l becomes important. Having a smaller l size results in a higher percentage of negatives, though the size of the group n becomessmaller (figure 2 and eq.(1)). When m and l increase the length of\u03b4 becomes larger, which requires solving for a greater combination of possible solutions. If the uncertainty in the tests is large, finding a solution and determining the positives is not always possible, though if solutions are found we always determine all positives, even if there are false positives. For example, for 252,000 patients, we performed 100 independent tests with 10 tubes each, and allowed each patient samples to be distributed to 5 tubes (see right subplot of figure 2, bluecross curve), even at high uncertainty of 32.77 ng (14.9% error), we were able to determine all positives in 90 tests out of 100 tests that were carried out. Thus, all positives from 226,800 patients were determined. In the remaining 8 tests, no solution was found and thus there is no risk for false negatives, in any of the tests. However, in this case we are only able to determine, on average 67.67% of all negatives in all 100 tests (see left subplot of figure 2, blue-cross curve). If a more accurate test is applicable, say with an uncertainty of 2.048 ng ( 1% error), %99.6 of all negatives are identified in all 100 tests. Note that in figure 2 the percentage of positives is variable and selected randomly to mimic an actual scenario were we don't know the percentage of infected patients a priori.Although attention was focused here on enhancing lab tests for COVID-19, in particular, and epidemics in general, we believe that the proposed method can be equally implemented in a variety of lab tests. In fact, once the solutions vector \u03b4 is obtained one could structure back quantities in each of the infected samples, i.e. r = R T \u03b4.
