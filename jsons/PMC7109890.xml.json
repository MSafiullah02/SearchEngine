Beetles were extracted from litter or manure by sieving samples through 2.8 and 2.0 mm screens. They were transported to the laboratory and reared in covered plastic chambers (27.5 long \u00d7 17.5 wide \u00d7 17.5 cm deep, Penn Plax Large Animal Carrier, Garden City, NY) with wood shavings. The beetles were maintained at 28 \u00b1 1\u00b0C under reverse L:D (14:10 h) photoperiod. Water and chick starter feed were provided, and rolled cardboard was added to serve as shelter and pupation sites. To get the uniform age seventh instar lesser mealworms for bioassays, \u223c5,000 sixth instars (7 mm in length, according to Wilson and Miner 1969) were separated from field-collected beetles and placed in plastic chambers. Chick starter feed and water were provided weekly to these larvae. After 7 d, the chambers were checked regularly for cast skins to confirm that larvae had molted to the seventh instar (8 mm in length, Wilson and Miner 1969). The newly molted seventh instars (light colored exoskeleton) were removed for bioassays. For uniform aged adults, a piece of rolled corrugated cardboard (30 cm2) was placed in each plastic rearing chamber that contained \u223c5,000 seventh instars. Chambers were checked weekly to confirm molting, and pupae were collected and allowed to eclose into adults. The newly emerged adults were removed, and held in groups of 100 per petri dish (150 mm diameter). The adult exoskeleton was allowed to completely harden over a 5 d period (Hopkins et al. 1992), during which these adults were provided feed (1 g finely ground chicken feed) and water (daily moistened 2 cm2 cotton ball).",

The area under each GC peak for each volatile peak from an injected CDV sample was related to the area for ethyl caprate peak in the sample. The area under the ethyl caprate peak in each sample was adjusted with a calibration curve to quantify the natural ratios of compounds in each sample. Eight compounds were identified from GC/MS analysis of CDV, including: 2-methyl-propanoic acid, 2, 3-butanediol, butanoic acid, 2-pentanone, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-chlorocyclohexanol, pentanoic acid, and dodecanal (Table 1).",

Pheromone lure doses ranging from 1 to 100 \u03bcg were tested to determine responses of lesser mealworm adults and larvae. Because 20 \u03bcg of pheromone lure was found to be more attractive in preliminary bioassays, this amount of pheromone lure, or individual components of pheromone lure was used in subsequent bioassays.

An 8 h period was shown to allow optimal insect dispersal in preliminary bioassay tests. Bioassays were conducted for 8 h in complete darkness at 28\u00b0C and 50 \u00b1 10% relative humidity (RH). One hundred and fifty test beetles were used in each replicate and four replicates were used for each treatment. Beetles were starved for 12 h before the bioassays. Beetles were placed under an inverted glass funnel (5 cm diameter at widest point) at the center of the arena for 8 h before release to allow for acclimation to the experimental conditions. These acclimated beetles were released at the down-wind end of the arena at 1 h after the dark cycle began, and their distribution recorded after 8 h. The treatment cup positions were reversed after each replicate to eliminate any positional cues. Two testing arenas 2.5 cm apart were used simultaneously.

After bird removal, all the houses remained vacant for 2 wk before a new flock of broilers was introduced. There were always high numbers of beetles in the poultry houses for two reasons: 1) beetle-infested litter is normally removed from the poultry houses to surrounding pasture fields during the summer when the outside temperatures are suitable for larval development, adult emergence and adult flight, and 2) poultry houses are only treated with insecticides during the flock-free period (2 wk) when the heat inside poultry house is turned off and majority of beetles are either hiding in building structures or hiding deep inside the litter layer. These beetles do not come in contact with insecticides. Savage (1992) speculated that if litter applied is 0.4 km from the poultry house, and the beetle dispersal is random, \u224860,000 beetles for every one million applied to the field would return to the poultry house.

These numbers were based on a 1 d trap catch before starting the experiment. The building was 99 \u00d7 14 m wide with the long axis orientated east to west and was managed to produce six or 8 wk-old broiler chickens, but it did not contain birds at the start of this study. Two automatic feeder lines ran the length of the house, 2 m out from the wall. The floor of the house was covered with used pine wood-shaving litter \u22488 cm deep. Plastic trays (56 \u00d7 34 cm) containing chick feed were placed 2 d before chicks were introduced inside the house. They were used to supplement the automatic feeders so that newly hatched chicks had optimal feed access during the first 10 d of a production cycle. The trays were located in three parallel lines. One row of trays was located under feed spouts on either side of the permanent feeder pans. The remaining two rows were on either side of the feed line beneath each automatic feeder line and the tray spacing was 1 m. The beetle traps were placed parallel to the feeder lines or feeder pans and were spaced \u22481 m apart. The experiment was a randomized complete block (RCB) design with four blocks: one and two on the north side of the house and three and four on the south side (Fig. 1). Each block consisted of two treatments randomly assigned within each block: six traps with pheromone-treated septa; and six traps with untreated (control) septa. Trapping was conducted over three consecutive days from 20 to 23 August 2008. The house temperature was 28\u00b0C when the traps were initially placed and baited in the afternoon. The beetles were collected from the traps after 24 h and trap baits were replaced. By then, propane heaters raised the house temperature to 34\u00b0C (the rearing temperature of the young birds). After the second 24 h period, trapped beetles were again removed and baits replaced. At this time, 10,000 1-d-old chicks were released into the facility, and once again, beetles were collected from the traps after 24 h. Thus, the beetle response to the treated septa was monitored for 1 and 2 d before chick introduction and for 1 d afterward, and the time period of the study included a defined temperature change. Chicks were free to roam inside the poultry house. Chicken droppings had been observed all over on the floor in poultry house. However, more droppings were present near feeder lines.",

Similar studies were done to assess pheromone performance in laboratory pitfall bioassays for the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Phillips and Burkholder 1981), the sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) (Mikolajczak et al. 1984), the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky and the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum Herbst (Phillips et al. 1993). In the current study, adults and larvae were strongly attracted to a dose of 20\u201330 \u03bcg synthetic lesser mealworm pheromone lure in laboratory pitfall bioassays. Lesser mealworm adults can perceive pheromones at lower doses, and were also more attracted than the larvae to higher doses of 50 and 100 \u03bcg. Our laboratory and field results confirm the larval attraction to adult pheromones. It is not known whether larvae of lesser mealworm produce compounds similar to adult emitted volatile profiles or not. Both adults and larvae feed on chicken feed and poultry manure (Pfeiffer and Axtell 1980). The larvae may have adapted and evolved the behavioral responses to male-produced aggregation pheromones for exploiting food resources and shelter occupied by adults.",

The very low attraction of limonene and linalool to lesser mealworm adults and larvae suggest that either they are nonattractive or attractive at a narrow range of concentrations in the laboratory two-choice pitfall bioassays. Limonene is a monoterpene that is found to be repellent against mealybugs and whiteflies (Hollingsworth 2005), and cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus (Canestrini) (Ferrarini et al. 2008). Linalool repelled 93% more mosquitoes than the unprotected control (Muller et al. 2009). The attractiveness of limonene and linalool needs to be assessed in dose-dependent response of lesser mealworm in laboratory pitfall bioassays. These compounds should be excluded if found nonattractive or repellent.",

Pheromones are usually perceived at minute quantities and elicit strong behavioral and antennal responses. While multiple chemicals and correct blends can be critical for pheromone activity, kairomone activity in general is even more dependent on multiple compounds and correct ratios, and kairomones frequently require more material for activity (Witzgall et al. 2008, Trona et al. 2010). The concentration of CDV (kairomone) used was half that of the pheromone lure in the laboratory pitfall bioassays. Therefore, the low concentration of CDV might have accounted for the low attractiveness of CDV to adults and larvae as compared with fresh CD. The low concentration of CDV might not have released the correct natural ratios of different volatile components. Testing CDV at higher doses might have produced a more pronounced response. The fresh CD might have released the volatile profiles in ratios more similar to those released in the poultry house, and also the larvae and adults perceived the CD volatiles as they do in their natural habitat.",

Adults were more attracted to the combination of pheromone lure and fresh CD than the larvae, whereas, larvae were more attracted to fresh CD alone than adults. These results were in agreement with other pest insects that exhibit increased attraction to host volatiles. Human urine and chicken feces increased lure attraction to fruit flies (Anostrepha spp.) in a commercial mango orchard in Veracruz, Mexico (Pinero et al. 2003). Scarab dung beetles were most attracted to swine and opossum feces in laboratory bioassays (Fincher et al. 1970). Odors from fresh chicken feces in water elicited upwind flight of host-seeking female Culex quinquefasciatus Say mosquitoes in a two-choice olfactometer (Cooperband et al. 2008).",

The presence of chicks affected distribution of beetles, and their droppings strongly competed with the pheromone lure. Nevertheless, a consistent effect of the pheromone over time was observed in low, moderate, and high-infestation houses for adults and larvae. The pheromone effect was consistent over space in moderate and high lesser mealworm infestation houses for adults, and the high lesser mealworm infestation house for larvae. The low larval population or clumped aggregations in the house (Strother and Steelman 2001) might be the reason for the variable attractiveness of pheromone over space for adults in a low infestation house, and for larvae in low and moderate infestation houses.",

Bray et al. (2010) demonstrated the practical application of pheromones in experimental chicken sheds, where the addition of the synthetic pheromone (\u00b1)-9-methylgermacrene-B resulted in greater numbers of male and female sand fly, Lutzomyia longipalpis Lutz & Neiva being caught and killed with sprayed insecticide, compared with pheromone-free controls.",
