Among 102 diarrhoeic faecal samples of sucking (n \u00bc 50) and weaned (n \u00bc 52) piglets from 31 different farms in Korea, five samples (4.9%) were detected positive by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but nine (8.8%) by nested-PCR.

Vesicular lesions, reproductive failure in swine and marine animals, and haemorrhagic diseases in rabbit have also been reported.

Porcine enteric calicivirus (PECV) was first reported in the USA and later also found in the UK, Hungary, Japan and Korea (Saif et al., 1980; Nagy et al., 1996; Sugieda et al., 1998; Park et al., 2000) . Sequence analysis revealed similarities between the PECV found in the USA and SVs from the UK, while NVs, detected from four caecal contents of pigs in Japan, were closely related to HuCV. The latter finding has raised public health concerns regarding the potential of crossspecies transmission, and swine as a possible host for HuCV (Sugieda et al., 1998) . Moreover, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has also detected enteric caliciviruses in foods, water, sewage and fomites. Thus HuCV has been suggested as the leading cause of food and waterborne viral gastroenteritis in humans (Mead et al., 1999; Schaub and Oshiro, 2000) . RT-PCR amplification of PECV RNA from stool specimens has been described. However, there are no reports of diagnosing PECV in Korea (Guo et al., 2001) . This is the first report of the molecular epidemiology of PECV outbreaks in Korea, which covers a 2-year period (2001) (2002) .",

They possess a single-stranded, plus-sense genomic RNA, which is 7.4-7.7 kb in size and encodes a single structural capsid protein of 58-80 kDa. The capsid protein is a polyprotein that contains motifs indicative of a putative 2C helicase, 3C-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D (RDRP), and a small basic protein of unknown function (Guo et al., 1999) . The RDRP protein of PECV is conserved among calicivirus strains (Guo et al., 1999) . As in SVs, the PECV capsid proteins are divided into three distinguished regions. The N-terminal region 1 (aa 1711-1984 for PECV) is highly conserved and shows higher amino acid sequence identities with those of SVs than with those of other caliciviruses. Region 2 (aa 1985-2132 for PECV) is hypervariable, and corresponds to regions C-E in feline calicivirus and to SMSV1 and SMSV4 (Neill, 1992; Liu et al., 1995; Guo et al., 1999) . The C-terminal region 3 is conserved but to a lesser extent than region 1. The capsid diversity among caliciviruses of the same genogroup or genus is mainly determined by the variability within region 2. This region may contain the multiple serotype-specific determinants recognized by monoclonal antibodies . Region 3 has conserved amino acid residues and a few antigenic epitopes but shows some variability Guo et al., 1999) .",

Primers of nested-PCR for the RDRP region were designed according to the published sequence of the RNA polymerase region of the Cowden strain. The sequence of these primers is as follows: primer nR (5\u00a2-GAGTGTCTGTTGGCTCAATG-3\u00a2, 4771-4752); primer nF (5\u00a2-CTCCTATGCTGAGGACA-CAC-3\u00a2, 4392-4411).

The extraction of single-stranded RNA was repeated twice with TRI, and combined aqueous phases from the first and second extractions. One-step RT-PCR assay was performed with modifications as described previously (Guo et al., 2001) . As a negative control, one-step RT-PCR and nested PCR were also performed with the extract of viral nucleic acid from Korean Field Isolate (KPEDV-9) of PEDV, and Miller strain of TGEV, cultured on vero and swine testicular cells (provided by Choong Ang Animal Disease Laboratory Ltd, Seoul, Korea) respectively. To increase the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR, 5 ll of diluted RT-PCR products (1 : 100) were added to a tube containing 45 ll of the PCR mixture (final dilution 1 : 1000). If the predicted band was absent by RT-PCR, 5 ll of undiluted RT-PCR product were subject to nested PCR. The first PCR product of double distilled water with all the necessary components was used as a negative control for nested PCR.",

The three specimens (10702, 10802 and 15802) of nested-PCR products (380 bp), directly sequenced for a part of the RDRP region of PECV, shared 100% of the nucleotide sequence investigated, suggesting the same original source for viruses in these faecal samples. However, the nucleotide sequences of the nested-PCR products from two other specimens (8402 and 6802) were to 99.4% and 92.6% identical with the above three (10702, 10802 and 15802). This finding suggested that the two viruses with the less sequence identities originated from different sources. In addition, Korean PECVs had high nucleotide (90.1-92.6%) and amino acid (98.3-99.1%) identities in a part of the putative RNA polymerase region, but low nucleotide (82.3-83.4%) and amino acid (85.2-86.3%) identities in a part of the capsid region, in comparison with those of the Cowden strain of tissue culture-adapted (TC) PECV and wild-type (WT) PECV. The Cowden strain PECV has higher overall amino acid sequence identity in the predicted RDRP protein with SVs rather than with vesiviruses, lagoviruses and NVs (Guo et al., 1999) . Similarly, the Korean PECV has a higher overall amino acid sequence identity (73%) with SVs than with vesiviruses (46.2-52.5%), lagoviruses (50.4%) or NVs (30.8-36.4%) (Fig. 1) .",

The other nested-PCR products (15802, 8402 and 6802), directly sequenced for a part of the capsid region of PECV, shared 99.8%, 99.8% and 85.5% nucleotide sequence identities, respectively, with the two specimens (10702 and 10802). In addition, the four specimens (8402, 10702, 10802 and 15802) of nested PCR products differ in their TAA nucleotide insertion from TC PECV, WT PECV and 6802. Due to this finding, Korean PECVs are classified into two groups when compared with the TC PECV and WT PECV regarding differences in the hypervariable capsid region. The nucleotide and amino acid changes between Korean PECV and that of the Cowden PECV may reflect Korea's different environmental condition, including climate and growing systems. The amplicons shared only limited amino acid sequence identities with a part of the capsid region of vesiviruses (20.5-21.6%), lagoviruses (15.8-23.4%) and NVs (18.0-24.9%). Moreover, these amplicons shared low amino acid identities with those of SVs (22.1-23.9%) (Fig. 1) . The reduced virulence could probably be due to the result of a potential change in tissue tropism or binding that may be related to the amino acid substitutions in the hypervariable capsid region. Thus, the amino acid changes in the capsid hypervariable region may be associated with both the cell culture adaptation and the attenuation of the virulence of the TC PECV in piglets. ",

NVs were detected in four caecal contents (0.09%) of 1117 clinically normal pigs slaughtered in Japan. In this study, SVs have been identified via sequence analysis as the type of caliciviruses that can cause porcine viral enteritis in Korea. Although there are no cases reported on the prevalence of SVs in Japan (Sugieda et al., 1998) , viruses were detected in nine of the collected faecal samples of 102 diarrhoeic pigs located at different pig farms in Korea. Among the 60 faecal samples without a history of diarrhoea, there were no positive samples by TEM and RT-PCR. These results conclude that SVs are associated with diarrhoea in piglets. Genetic analysis revealed that the TC Cowden PECV has one distant and three clustered amino acid substitutions in the capsid region, and two amino acid changes in the RNA polymerase region, when compared with the WT PECV (Guo et al., 1999) . All the Korean PECVs, which had been naturally transmitted, are more closely related to WT PECV than TC PECV.",

Moreover, most of the breeding pigs were imported from the USA and Europe where this type of enteric virus is omnipresent. In addition, the Korean PECV was closely related to HuCV from UK and USA. PECV is the only virus, among caliciviruses to cause gastrointestinal diseases that is presently being exploited in an in vitro model system (Chang et al., 2005) .
