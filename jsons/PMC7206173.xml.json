Existing HAR techniques are either video- or sensor-based. In particular, sensor-based HAR aims at inferring human activities from a set of sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer), which generate data streams over time. This approach is generally known to have several advantages over video-based HAR including: ease of deployment, low cost and less invasive from a privacy perspective [7].",

Traditional machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest are employed to project the feature vector to activity labels [2]. The performance of these methods normally depends on the effectiveness of the extracted features where are heuristic, task-independent, and not specially designed for HAR [12]. Since designing powerful task-specific features require significant domain knowledge, and are labour intensive and time consuming, recent research introduces deep learning methods, which have exceptional data representation ability to expedite feature extraction. These works utilize deep neural networks, such as Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) [5, 16] and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) [8, 11], as feature extractors to learn the representation of the input sensory segments automatically, and then map the representation to labels using another neural network (normally a basic fully-connected layer).",

Considering the sensitivity of neural networks to noise, the biases in the representations further prevent neural network-based classifiers from making correct activity classification. In addition, subject variances inherently exist in HAR, where people tend to perform activities that are heavily influenced by personal characteristics, such as gender, height, weight, and strength. For example, men usually perform activities at a larger magnitude than women. Such divergence introduces deviations to the representations among subjects and thus prevent the model from getting accurate classification for new subjects (haven\u2019t appeared in the training set).",

Therefore, using a distance metric which can infer the type of an input segment from labels of the most similar prototype is likely to make the classification module less susceptible to the preciseness of the data representations (compared to neural network based classification). 3) Training Stage: the subject variance can be explicitly modeled and minimized in the training stage to enhance the generalization ability of the approach.",

We also introduce a cross-subject training strategy to train the module for minimizing the deviation caused by subject-variance.We conduct extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets under a strict subject-independent setting and demonstrate the superior performance of our model in new subjects. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by at least 3%.\n",

            "text": "The recent work in HAR has moved towards designing deep learning models for more accurate recognition, given the exceptional representation ability of deep learning techniques. Most deep learning-based HAR methods focus on capturing the temporal correlations in the sensory streams. Jian Bo et al. [16] tackle the problem with convolutional neural networks, in which the convolution and pooling filters are designed along the temporal dimensions to process the readings of all sensors. Their work can capture long-term temporal correlation by stacking multiple CNN layers. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez et al. [12] further extend this model to DeepConvLSTM by integrating LSTM after CNN layers. The proposed DeepConvLSTM framework contains four CNN layers and two LSTM layers to capture the short-term and long-term temporal correlations, separately. One drawback of the DeepConvLSTM is that it potentially assumes the signals in all time steps are relevant and contribute equally to the target activity, which may not true. Murahari et al. [11] propose to solve the problem by integrating the temporal attention module to DeepConvLSTM. The attention module aligns the output vector at the last time step with other vectors at earlier steps to learn a relative importance score for each previous time step. Different from these methods, Guan et al. [8] propose to achieve more robust data representation ability with the ensemble method. They employ the Epoch-wise Bagging scheme in the training procedure and select multiple LSTMs in different training epochs as basic learners to form a powerful model. However, these methods neglect the spatial correlations among the different sensors, which cannot represent the sensory data precisely. Besides, they directly classify the learned representations to activity type with basic NN-based classifier, which could lead to misguided result due to the learning deviation and subject variances in the representations.",

Besides, it is more light-weight and easy-to-train compared to LSTM-based approaches [8, 11, 12].\n",

Different from the general HAR process, which first learns a representation for the input segment and then maps the representation to the corresponding activity with classifiers, DCAM first learns a representation for the input segment and a latent prototype representation (a vector) for each class together. The prototypes are used to represent the embedding of each class. Then, DCAM recognizes the segment representation by comparing its similarity with the prototypes, which follows the same idea with the nearest neighbour methods. For clarity, we denote the data used to learning the prototypes as the support set and the segments to be recognized as queries (see Fig. 2). In the training period, both support set and queries come from the training dataset. In the testing phase, we extract the support set from the training dataset and the queries from the testing dataset to avoid the information leakage.\n",

Then, a distance-based classification model is introduced, which classify the segments by comparing their similarity to the learned prototypes of each class in the representation space. Comparing to the NN-based classification module, the distance-based classification model is less susceptible to the bias in the segment representations.
