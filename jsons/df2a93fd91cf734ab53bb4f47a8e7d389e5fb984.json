Because of this, finding effective therapy and prophylactic strategies has become a maximum priority (1). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has shown to be active against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro by inhibiting several steps of the viral replication cycle, including some of the earliest ones, as the fusion to cell membrane (2) . For this reason, and despite the in vivo effectivity of HCQ is still a matter of controversy (3, 4) , using this drug has been proposed as a rational strategy for postexposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (5) . Indeed, at least nine clinical trials aimed to test this hypothesis are currently ongoing (6) .",

Data on this issue may provide us with worthy information on the potential of HCQ therapy as a prophylactic strategy, which may help to better design clinical trials. Because of this, in this study we aimed to compare the incidence of COVID-19 in Spanish patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases treated with HCQ and without HCQ therapy, during seven weeks in the pandemic.",

In these patients, we evaluated the cases diagnosed with COVID-19 from February 27 th to April 16 th . In this period, 182816 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in Spain (7). To evaluate the number of COVID-19 cases among the study patients, we searched for episodes of attendance to hospitals because of COVID-19 related symptoms in the shared electronic medical record of the hospitals of the Andalusian Health Service. COVID-19 was defined according to the Spanish Health Ministry criteria (8), as: 1) Confirmed: SARS-CoV-2 PCR in nasopharynx swab, serum antibody or antigen turned out to be positive. 2) Likely: serious acute respiratory infection, with symptoms and chest X-Ray signs consistent with COVID-19, but without microbiological confirmation. 3) Possible: mild acute respiratory infection during the study period,where microbiological studies were not carried out.In the statistical analysis, continuous variables were compared by the Mann-Whitney U test and the categorical ones by the Fisher test. For the main rates, percentages and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated. Statistical analyses were conducted using the package STATA 16.0 StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA.",
