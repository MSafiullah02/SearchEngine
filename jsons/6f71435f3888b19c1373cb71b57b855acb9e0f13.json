It requests tasks basing on the defined rules. The robot/atr uses user intents captured by the robot hardware (e.g. microphone), and the operator /atr uses an application that is used for robot supervision. 5) Task Harmoniser Agent: receives task requests from the Task Requester Agents and schedules Dynamic Agents basing on a specified algorithm (e.g. priorities). The problem of Dynamic Agents scheduling was introduced in [8] . It communicates with RAPP Store Agent in order to download a proper task files implementing a Dynamic Agent.

TIAGo is equipped with a built-in microphone [21] , but it is mounted inside the robot's body, close to the head's motor. Stiff mounting of the microphone causes a high level of rumble noises during the movement, which made it almost impossible to recognise speech. To counteract this problem mounting was changed to soft sponge, but limited space inside the robot made it hard to eliminate all noises. Next problem was the long cable connecting the microphone with audio interface. This analogue cable is long and runs parallel to a bundle of high-current power cables, which induces high level of non-uniform noise. Another problem was a low dynamic range of the device. When the amplification was set too low, commands spoken from the bigger distance were ignored. Too high amplification, on the other hand, makes the noises even worse and effects with signal clipping when the user is near the robot.",

Our testing environment is rather big (almost a 100 m 2 single room). There are also some places, where the high closets stand on the line-of-sight between the robot and the operator. In order to analyse the effect of the room shape and existing obstacles on the audio recognition accuracy word-spotting accuracy test was carried. During the experiment, the robot was static and different operators were trying to trigger the robot using the keyword from 12 different places (Fig. 8) . Each of the 5 users said the keyword 10 times in each spot. Keyword spotting was running on both internal and external microphone to compare the results. Robot Fig. 8 .

For example, the kitchen (spot 1) is separated from the robot with the closets. Structure elements (pillars) also can interfere direct path from the operator to the robot (spot 7). As the effective robot behaviours triggering is crucial, adding alternative resources for this purpose was a natural decision. It was achieved by utilising smart-home infrastructure and expanding it with a buttons. That kind of arrangement guarantees successful human-robot interaction.",

Such robots should communicate with patients in various ways to achieve reliable service of e.g. people that can not operate with hands or have problems with speaking.
