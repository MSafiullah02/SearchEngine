            "text": "Infectious diseases of animals, especially viral, often cause great losses in the domestic animal industries. Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute and highly contagious respiratory disease of chickens, and is still a major health problem in the chicken industry. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an enveloped coronavirus containing an unsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, is one of the primary causes of respiratory disease in domestic fowl. Infection with IBV reduces the performance of broilers and causes drops in egg production and egg quality (Bijlenga et al., 2004, Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003, Cavanagh, 2003). There are problems with vaccines against infectious bronchitis applied in the field. Live attenuated vaccine may spread to unvaccinated flocks (Farsang et al., 2002); inactivated vaccine does not elicit an immune response against coronavirus (Yang et al., 2004, Stohlman et al., 1992), and severe side effects and long-lasting local response may occurs after inoculation.",

However, chemical adjuvants (e.g. aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)3), aluminium phosphate (AlPO4), and mineral oil) commonly cause side effects, such as strong local reaction and carcinogenesis. Sometimes a chemical adjuvant may fail to enhance the immunogenicity of a weakly antigenic vaccine (Xie, 1995, Gong and Wu, 1996, Sun, 1998). Therefore, there is a need to assess an immunopotentiator that is both safe and efficacious.",

Recent pharmacological studies have shown that SNH and houttuyfonate have similar pharmacological properties, with a variety of biological functions, in addition to antibacterial, diuretic, antitussive, but also play a strong role in immune regulation. In addition SNH is safer and has fewer side effects than houttuyfonate (Jiang et al., 2006, Zhu et al., 2008a, Zhu et al., 2008b, Yuan et al., 2004b). However, its application in the poultry industry has seldom been reported. In this study, with chicken IBV H120 strain live attenuated vaccine in chickens, by measuring peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation and serum cytokines and antibody titers, the humoral and cellular immunity induced with SNH was researched. The results indicated SNH could enhance immune function in a dose-dependent manner. The results show that SNH played an important role in protecting against challenge by virulent virus.",

IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 are prototype Th1 and Th2 cytokines, respectively, whose antagonistic actions against each other have been widely reported (Mosman and Sad, 1996). They reciprocally regulate not only Th1 and Th2 cell survival and subsequent differentiation, but also activation and differentiation of B cells as well as monocytes (Constant and Bottomly, 1997, Snapper and Paul, 1987, Cao et al., 1989). Specific target molecules that are counter-regulated by IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 play important roles in mediating Th1 or Th2 immune responses. Serum levels of the two cytokines increased, and this effect shows a certain degree of dose\u2013effect relationship, especially obvious with the 200 mg/L dose. Therefore it was important to determine the appropriate dose of SNH to take advantage of the body\u2019s immune system. At the same time, T lymphocyte-mediated cellular immunity was also researched. The results show that SNH can significantly enhance the immune function of chicken cells by promoting lymphocyte proliferation. So, SNH improved cellular immunity in comparison with PBS or IL-2.",
