            "text": "Intestinal transplantation (ITx) represents the physiologic alternative to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for patients suffering from life-threatening complications of irreversible intestinal failure. The number of transplants performed worldwide has been increasing for several years until recently (Fig. 4.1) [1]. ITx has recently become a valid therapeutic option with a graft survival rate between 80 % and 90 % at 1 year, in experienced centers [1]. These results have been achieved due to a combination of several factors: better understanding of the pathophysiology of intestinal graft, improved immunosuppression techniques, more efficient strategies for the monitoring of the bowel graft, as well as control of infectious complications and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) . In fact, this procedure is associated with a relatively high rate of complications, such as infections, acute rejection, graft versus host disease (GVHD), and PTLD, if compared to the transplantation of other organs [2\u20135]. These complications may be, at least in part, the consequence of the peculiarity of this graft, which contains gut-associated lymphoid tissue and potentially pathogenic enteric flora. Furthermore, in these patients, the existing disease and the relative malnutrition could predispose them to infectious complications. Additionally, other factors associated with the procedure, such as laparotomy, preservation injury, abnormal motility, and lymphatic disruption, could all be implicated in the development of complications.",

Differently to what occurred in liver and kidney transplantation , the use of living donors for ITx has been limited mostly because deceased intestinal donors are available. However, optimal deceased intestinal donors are not common either. In fact, despite the fact that the number of patients waiting for ITx is limited, the time spent on the waiting list increased compared to previous years for all candidates on the waiting list. In 2011, 41.7 % of patients listed waited less than 1 year for ITx, while 25.1 % waited between 1 and 2 years, and 33.2 % waited for more than 2 years [6]. Despite the fact that mortality on the waiting list has decreased in the US in recent years compared to the past, it is still reported to be up to 20 % per year on the waiting list [6, 7]. All this suggests that despite the fact that many cadaver donors are available, they are often not utilized because they are not adequate to satisfy the need of patients waiting for ITx.",

In fact, the use of intestinal grafts from living donors, when compared to cadaver donors, offers important advantages with low risks, and these are summarized in Table 4.1.",

LD-ITx also would allow transplantation in developing countries where TPN and deceased donor are not easily available. Furthermore, because LD-ITx is an elective procedure, it can be performed when the donor and the recipient conditions are optimal, and the donor bowel preparation can be easily performed, leading to a decreased risk of infectious complications. In an analysis of 50 pediatric ITx recipients, it has been shown that the length of graft preservation was the most significant factor in inducing bacterial translocation [11, 12]. This phenomenon can contribute to the high rate of infections seen during the early posttransplant period also considering that this coincides with the timing of maximum amount of immunosuppression given to the patient.",

Deceased donors are often subject to either cardiac arrest or resuscitation, to prolonged periods of hypotension, or use of vasopressors. All these could result in splanchnic hypoperfusion, which can trigger ischemia/reperfusion injury even before the intestine is procured from the donor. Cold preservation of the graft can be also extended due to the distance between procurement and transplant centers. This can further increase such injury considering that specific preservation solutions designed for intestinal grafts are not yet available. The use of living donors can obviate these problems, since the donor is a healthy individual, hemodynamically stable, and with consequent normal intestinal perfusion. Furthermore, the short cold ischemic time prior to revascularization also improves graft quality, virtually eliminating ischemia/reperfusion injury, and may reduce the rate of posttransplant infections [12].",

            "text": "Another not negligible benefit of LD-ITx is immunologic [8, 9]. A living donor is often a relative of the recipient due to the strong emotional involvement that justifies the donation. Living related donors have a closer distribution of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) with the recipient that could contribute to an immunologic advantage. This is supported by the experience of HLA-matched transplants performed between homozygote twins [13]. This point might be challenged since in recent times, a significant decreased rate of rejection has been also observed using HLA-unmatched deceased donors [1, 14]. However, this improvement has been accomplished using more potent immunosuppression and induction therapy with polyclonal antibodies. However, a similarly low rate of rejection is seen using living related HLA-matched donors using a less potent immunosuppressive regimen [8, 9, 15]. An additional benefit can be offered performing LD-ITx at an earlier stage of the disease, since long-term TPN and indwelling venous catheters can be associated with priming of the immune system, as recently suggested [16\u201318].",

The potential risk can be hypothetically calculated, using a parallelism with general surgery-related data of small bowel resection; about 3\u20135 % of the donors could develop a small bowel obstruction [19\u201324]. In large series, the mortality rate for patients with small bowel obstruction is approximately 2 % for the lifetime of the patient [25].

Crossmatch should be negative, and among multiple donor candidates, the one with the best HLA match should be preferred and should be directed to continue the workup. The cornerstone of success is the identical or compatible HLA. For this reason, it is preferred that living donors be relatives of the recipients. The donor can also be unrelated to the recipient but should have a compatible HLA and close emotional relationship. This condition and the absence of any financial interest or coercion for donation are of paramount importance in LD-ITx, just like any other type of live organ donation.

Eight additional arteries usually originate from the ileal branch of the ileocolic artery [32]. These intestinal vessels branch a few centimeters from the border of the intestine to form arterial arcades connecting the intestinal arteries with one another. Proximally, a single set of arcades is present; distally, there are usually several sets of arcades. These arches form the primary interconnections of the arterial supply. From arches and arcades, the vasa recta arise and pass without cross-communication to enter the intestinal wall. A complete channel may also exist from the posteroinferior pancreaticoduodenal artery that is parallel to the intestine and joins the marginal artery of Drummond of the colon. The terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, and right colon receive blood supply also from the right colic artery and ileocolic artery, often sharing a common origin, connected by the marginal artery of Drummond to the terminal branches of the SMA (Fig. 4.6). In 5 % of the population, blood supply to these structures is guaranteed only by the ileocolic artery, as the marginal artery is incomplete (Fig. 4.7).

This vessel can be transected below the takeoff of the right colic artery to avoid hypoperfusion of the terminal ileum, and the preservation of the ileocecal valve in the donor (Fig. 4.8). At this level, this artery is commonly single, but could also consist of two or more branches. Additionally, despite the fact that both jejunum and ileum have the ability to adapt following intestinal resection, the ileum has the advantage of allowing structural and functional adaptation [33, 34].",

In each individual case, the entire small bowel should be measured from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve, using a sterile surgical tape. Once the length of the entire small bowel is determined in a particular patient under a specific anesthetic agent, a final determination of the segment to be removed is made. Although it is relatively easy to determine when an intestinal segment is too short, the long-term impact to the donor of the resection of a longer segment is unknown. Deltz reported a transplant of a 60-cm segment of distal jejunum and proximal ileum, whereas, Morris used a similarly long segment of distal ileum, ileocecal valve, and a portion of the cecum [44, 45]. Despite these early successes, a length of 60-cm small bowel has been generally inadequate to provide a TPN-free condition [44], and resection of the ileum, ileocecal valve, and cecum can have a negative impact on the function of the remaining donor bowel (e.g., increased transit time and vitamin B12 deficiency) [45].",

It is clear that the ileocecal valve and terminal ileum should be preserved in the donor, and that the segment of intestine to be removed should be the ileum. Only 20\u201330 % of the total length of the small intestine should be resected to minimize risk to the donor, as no data are available to determine the ideal length of the intestine to preserve. The successful use of ileal segments between 150 and up to 200 cm of length has been reported, with no sign of long-term complications in the donors [15]. Generally, the expectation is that the adaptation of the residual intestine will take place, compensating for the segment removed, and reestablishing a completely normal functional condition.

The line of dissection of the mesentery starts from the marks on the ileum and is directed toward the previously dissected and looped blood vessels. Once all the dissection is performed, the intestinal segment is still vascularized through a triangle of mesentery containing the distal superior mesenteric vessels (Fig. 4.13). Once the recipient is ready in the adjacent operating room, the intestine is transacted using a gastrointestinal anastomosis (GIA) stapler. Adequate blood supply to the proximal and the distal stumps of the ileum is confirmed when it is transected by GIA stapler (Fig. 4.14). The ileocolic vessels are clamped and transacted, and the vasculature of the intestinal segment is flushed using 4\u2103 cold preservation solution on the back table. As the graft is transported to the recipient operating room for transplantation, the vascular stumps in the donor are ligated using nonabsorbable monofilament stick ties. The proximal and distal segments of the ileum are re-anastomosed primarily using either a GIA or a manual technique. To avoid intraperitoneal spillage of intestinal content, the intestine is clamped using linen-shod noncrushing Doyen clamps closed at one to two clicks. If the manual technique is used, our preference is to use an absorbable monofilament for the mucosal layer and a nonabsorbable monofilament for the sero-muscular layer using Lambert or Cushing stitches. A side-to-side technique is preferred to minimize the risk of stenosis. The mesenteric defect should be closed carefully. The abdomen is then closed using absorbable monofilament for the fascia and subcuticular for skin closure; the surgical drain is not necessary.",

These can go from the presence of the entire dysfunctional intestine in patients with pseudo-obstruction, to the ultra-short gut syndrome with only a portion of the duodenum intact. In all cases, the anatomy should be well identified pretransplantation to plan the best surgical approach. The goal of the operation is to reestablish intestinal continuity by transplanting the segment of ileum recovered from the donor. The proximal and distal (if present) segments of intestine in the recipient should be always preserved and used for the anastomosis.

In this case, the presence of diffuse intra-abdominal adhesions requires a long and careful dissection to identify vascular and intestinal structures and anomalies. For this reason, we start the recipient operation first and initiate the procedure in the donor in the adjacent operating room only when the recipient anatomy is identified. A midline incision from the xiphoid process to the pubis is used. The operation is carried out to identify the aorta, vena cava, and the proximal and distal intestinal stumps. Once this is accomplished, the graft is removed from the donor and is transported in the recipient operating room. The previously dissected aorta and vena cava are used for the anastomoses. The vena cava is clamped in its infrarenal portion with a Satinsky vascular clamp. The ileocolic vein is anastomosed end to side with running nonabsorbable monofilament. The mesenteric artery is anastomosed end to side to the aorta after this vessel is also clamped using a vascular clamp. In this case, a running or interrupted anastomosis is performed, depending on the size of the vessel using nonabsorbable monofilament. If the vascular pedicle consists of multiple arteries, these are anastomosed individually. Once the vascular anastomoses have been completed, the intestinal graft is reperfused (Fig. 4.16). The proximity of the vena cava and aorta allows anastomosis without tension, as the vascular pedicle of the graft can be short. However, an alternative vascular approach, for example, using the portal vein, could also be utilized.",

Often, this is the duodenum or the proximal jejunum. Care should be taken not to shorten the native intestine unless pseudo-obstruction or motility disorder is present. The intestine is anastomosed using a hand-sewn technique side to side along its anti-mesenteric border. Our preference is to use absorbable monofilament for the mucosal layer and a nonabsorbable monofilament for the seromuscular layer using Lambert or Cushing stitches. The same is done for the distal portion of the graft if a segment of colon is available. To avoid intraperitoneal spillage of the intestinal content, the intestine is clamped using linen-shod noncrushing Doyen clamps closed at one to two clicks. A temporary loop ileostomy is constructed and is maintained for 6 months. This is used for endoscopy, feces sample collection, and the evaluation of the graft mucosa visible in the stoma. Construction of the loop ileostomy is performed after the intestinal anastomoses have been completed, and intestinal continuity is reestablished. At this point, a site in the lower quadrant is identified to perform the ileostomy without tension, depending on the length of the mesenteric vessels, the anatomy of the recipient, and the intestinal reconstruction performed. This is performed excising a 2-cm diameter circle of skin followed by a 2-cm incision of the fascia. The muscle fibers are spread and the tips of two fingers should be easily introduced into the opening. The loop should be gently exteriorized using a Babcock clamp, and a rod is introduced in a small opening of the mesentery to keep the loop in position. The anterior wall of the ileum is opened slightly more than 50 % of its circumference. The proximal stoma is larger and is kept cephalad. The ileostomy is matured with mucocutaneous fixation using interrupted sutures. Sutures are also used to secure the graft to the peritoneum to prevent herniation, and to help in identifying the proximal and distal end of the ileostomy for future endoscopy.",

In previous reports, center volume had no effect on graft survival, but this may reflect the small number of procedures performed worldwide. There was no difference in graft survival or patient survival when comparing LD-ITx and ITx.

Certainly, removal of a kidney from a living person donor was partially justified by the fact that kidneys are paired organs, but what about intestine? To remove an organ from a living donor, as is the case in LD-ITx , ethical problems can arise; the first is the hurdle of the ancient medical maxim, \u201cdo not harm,\u201d taking in account that \u201ceven identical twins do not require a living donor\u201d [71]. Father Bert Cunningham anticipated its possibility with a thesis on the morality of organic transplantation. He considered the living donor a model of virtue for the reason that \u201cthere exist an ordination of men to one another and as a consequence, an order of their members to one another, thus we contend that men are ordinate to society as a part to the whole and, as such, are in some way ordinate to one another\u201d [72].

            "text": "Kidney transplantation became a routine operation, and we know that we can live well with one kidney; therefore, it does not raise particular ethical problems anymore. However, LD-ITx is a novelty in the field of transplant surgery. We believe that Daube gave a correct formulation of the ethical problem presented by LD-ITX. He suggested that more than consent is required. A medical judgment of relative risks to donor and recipient, a high degree of caution and concern for the donor, and the absence of alternatives \u201cplace on the transplanting surgeon a far greater responsibility\u201d [74]. This is exactly what informed consent, or conscious consent, as we prefer to call it, means [75]. We must consider three actors involved in the setting: the doctor, the recipient, and the donor. The doctor has the technical knowledge, and then he can act in the way marked out by Daube. The recipient is at risk of dying if the donor does not give a segment of its gut. Therefore, the point of view of the recipient is completely in favor of transplant. Certainly, the long-term mortality among recipients is high, but the all or nothing perspectives compel us to do good for the patient. Therefore, the only perspective that can give rise to an ethical question is the particular condition of the donor. As the donor is a healthy person, the operation could represent a sort of mutilation. However, in the perspective given by Cunningham and considering the rule \u201cdo not harm\u201d as a relativistic norm, where the imperative is beneficence, also for the others, we have the duty to consider living donor transplantation as an important tool in the field of surgery. All the existing data summarized in the chapter lean on the side of transplant. First of all, there are some problems, as the chapter pointed out, with deceased donors, taking into account that they are often subject to either cardiac arrest or resuscitation. Using living donors, we can obviate to these problems. Furthermore, LD-ITx can be performed and the recipient conditions are optimal and the donor bowel preparation can be easily performed, lessening the risk of infection complications. Not least, often a living donor is a relative of the recipient. This fact is not marginal, representing an unquestionable immunologic advantage. Furthermore, we have to consider that optimal deceased intestinal donors are not common, the waiting list is increasing, and the mortality for all candidates on the waiting list is reported to be up to 20 %. Besides, LD-ITx would improve the possibility to obtain transplant in developing countries, where TNP and deceased donors are not easily available. Considering that the principle of beneficence compels us to do what is best for the patient, LD-ITx represents the best treatment for patients. Finally, but not in order of importance, we must consider the risks to the donor, which include early surgical complications, such as small bowel obstruction, diarrhea, weight loss, and vascular thrombosis. These seem to be acceptable risks compared with the benefit to the recipient, which are going to be resolved in a short period of time. We must consider that with a careful and appropriate surgical technique , these risks can be still further reduced. Unfortunately, we do not have long-term follow-up of these patients. This fact could be a dilemma from an ethical point of view, but we have a lot of data from patients who opted for intestinal obstruction or abdominal infarction. Despite the fact that they had even wider resections, the long-term effects are acceptable. In light of these reasons, we believe that the LD-ITx represents a valid and ethical alternative to ITx from a deceased donor.",
