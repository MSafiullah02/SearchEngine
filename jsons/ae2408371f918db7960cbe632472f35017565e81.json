We examine the effect of control scenarios targeted at particular groups, such as school closures or social distancing by older people. Although we currently lack detailed empirical data about contact and infection rates between different age groups and groups with different levels of healthcare access within New Zealand, these scenarios illustrate how such evidence could be used to inform specific interventions. We find that an increase in the transmission rates amongst children as a result of reopening schools is, on its own, unlikely to significantly increase the number of cases. However, if this is accompanied by a change in adult behaviour, for example increased contact rates among parents, it could have a much bigger effect. We also find that there is a risk of undetected outbreaks occurring in communities that have low access to healthcare and that are socially isolated from more privileged communities. The greater the inequity and the greater the degree of social segregation, the longer it will take before any outbreaks are detected. Well-established evidence for health inequities, particularly in accessing primary healthcare and testing, indicates that M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples are at higher risk of undetected outbreaks in Aotearoa New Zealand. This highlights the importance of ensuring that community needs for access to healthcare, including early proactive testing, rapid contact tracing, and the ability to isolate, are being met equitably. Finally, these scenarios illustrate how information concerning contact and infection rates across different demographic groups may be useful in informing specific policy interventions.",

Despite its government's early claims to have contained the spread of COVID-19, a large secondary outbreak emerged in Singapore's migrant worker community in April (Singapore Ministry of Health, 2020) . These communities are housed in crowded dormitory precincts where self-isolation is difficult (TWC2, 2020) and report high levels of job insecurity, which creates structural disincentives to reporting illness and to enact self-isolation (HOME 2020). The experiences of migrant workers in Singapore, which include overcrowded housing, and lack of access to primary healthcare or sick leave, are an indicator of the importance of equitable epidemic control measures that account for the lived experiences of all.",

We estimate contact rates between broad age classes qualitatively from available data and test the sensitivity of the model to changes in the structure of the contact rates. The model is formulated in a mathematically general way that allows it to be applied to any number of population groups. This will be useful when combined with robust NZspecific data on contact rates between fine-grained groups at varying Alert Levels and epidemiological properties of COVID-19 within these groups. In this work, we use this model to explore two scenarios: the first is an agestructured model that splits the population into three groups based on age, which we use to investigate the effects of school closures, while the second splits the population into two communities in the presence of healthcare inequities.",

Within each group, individuals are assumed be homogeneous, with the exception of their individual reproduction number, which is heterogeneous and randomly distributed with a group-specific mean (see below). \uf0b7 Infected individuals fall into two categories: (i) those who show clinical symptoms at some point during their infection; and (ii) those who are asymptomatic or subclincal for the duration of their infection. Each new infection is randomly assigned as subclinical with probability and clinical with probability 1 \u2212 , independent of who infected them. This categorisation applies for the full duration of the infectious period, i.e. the clinical category includes pre-symptomatic individuals who later go on to develop clinical symptoms. The probability of being subclinical may vary between groups. \uf0b7 The average reproduction number of subclinical individuals in any group was assumed to be 50% of the average reproduction number of clinical individuals that group. This reflects lower infectiousness of subclincal cases (Davies et al., 2020a) . \uf0b7 In the absence of case isolation measures (see below), each infected individual causes a randomly generated number ~( ) of new infections. \uf0b7 As well as population heterogeneity across the different groups, individual heterogeneity in transmission rates was included by setting = for clinical individuals in group and = for subclinical individuals in group , where is a gamma distributed random variable with mean 1 and variance 2 (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005) . \uf0b7 The time between an individual becoming infected and infecting another individual, the generation time , is Weibull distributed with mean 5.0 days and standard deviation of 1.9 days (Ferretti 2020) . The infection times of all secondary infections from individual are independent, identically distributed random variables from this distribution (see Figure 1 ). An alternative log normal distribution and a Gamma distribution were investigated (Nishiura et al., 2020) .

During this period, their infectiousness is as shown by the blue curve in Figure 1 . Once they develop more serious symptoms, they are isolated and their infectiousness reduces to = 65% (Davies et al., 2020a) of the value it would have without isolation (green curve in Figure 1 ). This represents a control policy of requiring symptomatic individuals to self-isolate. \uf0b7 In the model, individuals with subclinical infections are not isolated. \uf0b7 Clinical individuals have a probability of detection . Cases that are not detected do not get isolated and are not included in the data but, unlike subclinical individuals, are fully infectious. \uf0b7 All individuals are assumed to be no longer infectious 30 days after being infected. This is an upper limit for computational convenience; in practice, individuals have very low infectiousness after about 12 days because of the shape of the generation time distribution (Fig. 1 ). \uf0b7 The time between infection and isolation the sum of two random variables 1 and 2 . 1 represents the time from infection to onset of symptoms and has a gamma distribution with mean 5.5 days and shape parameter 5.8 (Lauer et al., 2020) . 2 is taken from New Zealand case data (see below). \uf0b7 The model does not explicitly include a latent period. However, the shape of the Weibull generation time distribution ( Figure 1 ) captures this effect, giving a low probability of a short generation time between infections. \uf0b7 The model is simulated using a time step of = 1 day.

We have tested the sensitivity of model results to variations in some of the model parameters whose values are uncertain or context-dependent. These include the proportion and relative infectiousness of subclinical cases, the heterogeneity in individual reproduction numbers, the mean generation time, and the values in the contact matrix. Any change in parameters that results in a change in the overall population reproduction number causes a corresponding change in the trajectory of case numbers. However, if the value of is fixed, the model is robust to these parameters and the qualitative results described in the scenarios above are not affected. Increasing heterogeneity in individual reproduction numbers increases variation between independent stochastic realisations and increases the probability of ultimate extinction (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005) . This is important in scenarios that consider elimination of the virus as a potential outcome, but this was not the primary focus of our work here. Increasing mean generation times slows the spread of the virus and, if the model were then calibrated against empirical case data, this would require a larger value of 0 (and by implication greater relative reduction in 0 at each Alert Level). However, the distinction between short generation time and low 0 versus longer generation time and higher 0 is not crucial in scenarios where there is no significant herd immunity. Model results are insensitive to moderate changes in the contact matrix but will change slightly if very extreme values are used.",

It is also consistent with projections for age-stratified contact rates for New Zealand (Prem 2017) aggregated into coarser age groups.

We also keep the first row of the contact matrix the same as at Levels 1 and 2 (see Table 2 ). This means that a higher proportion of secondary infections originating from children are in other children. We see that relaxation of control for children has only a small effect on the total number of cases and the overall population effective reproduction number is still less than 1 (Table 1) . However, the light blue line shows the effect of opening schools with an associated increase in adult, i.e. parental, interaction. Here, the average reproduction number for adults is also set to the higher level under Alert level 3 (Table 1 ) and the adult row of the contact matrix reverts back to the Level 1-2 values (Table 1 ).

Although we lack detailed data on contact and transmission rates between some groups at varying Alert Levels, we have made a number of assumptions that allow us to explore the potential effects of omitting these in the original model. In particular, we have looked at two sets of scenarios where age and healthcare access are likely to be important and which would not be well described by a homogeneous population model. Firstly, we considered school closures, where it is important to capture differences in infection and contact rates in adults and school pupils. Secondly, we looked at a scenario where socio-economic and healthcare inequities lead to a large secondary outbreak in a high-risk community, much like that which occurred in migrant worker communities Singapore. The effective reproduction numbers for these scenarios are shown in There are some important caveats to this work. While we have endeavoured to consider scenarios that are consistent with existing evidence, for the most part the current evidence base is currently too thin to draw firm conclusions, particularly around school closures. Nonetheless, it is anticipated that better information on contact rates for various groups in New Zealand will be available soon. This study illustrates how such information will allow us to better understand the risk factors for specific communities in New Zealand and how specific control measures might reduce the impact on these communities.",

The New Zealand government has an obligation under Te Tiriti o Waitangi to deliver equitable health outcomes for M\u0101ori and other population groups (Waitangi Tribunal 2019). Our study highlights the potentially heightened risks of COVID-19 for M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples and communities, which experience inequities in health and healthcare access that not only increase the risks of infection but may also magnify the impacts of the disease. Furthermore, the scenarios we modelled show that the combination of unequitable access to health care combined with relatively low rates of contact with other more privileged sectors of the population are the biggest risk factors for undetected transmission. As such, the evidence suggests that urban Pacific communities are likely to be at high risk, as well as remote communities, including rural M\u0101ori communities. The government has a responsibility to work with these communities to ensure that their healthcare needs are being met by its COVID-19 response.",

A report from the United Kingdom suggests that ethnic minority groups are at significantly higher risk from COVID-19 (ICNARC 2020).
