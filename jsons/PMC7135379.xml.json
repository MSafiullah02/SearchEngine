With advances in immunosuppressive therapy, improved post-transplant renal function and reduced corticosteroid dose are reported to have led to a decrease in the incidence of ONFH [1], [2], [3], [4]. However, according to recent screening studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this incidence ranged from 3.8% to 25.5% [3], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], inferring that ONFH remains a significant complication among renal allograft recipients.",

Decreases in the doses of steroids and calcineurin inhibitors have also been reported [15] and indications for RT have therefore been expanded to include higher-risk patients with older age and increased human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch. However, the impact of basiliximab administration on the incidence of post-transplant ONFH has not yet been determined, and few MRI screening studies have been conducted since its introduction [3].",

            "text": "Improvements in post-transplant renal function and reductions in corticosteroid dose may have led to a decrease in the incidence of ONFH [1], [2], [3], [4]. Renal graft function after RT has been improving with advances in immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine A [2], [17] and tacrolimus [12], [13], [14]. Several other immunosuppressive agents including sirolimus, everolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and basiliximab have been introduced in combination with cyclosporine A or tacrolimus and have also improved postoperative renal function [18]. In contrast, few reports have been published about the influence of these new immunosuppressive agents on the incidence of ONFH after RT. Basiliximab, an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody, is a very strong immunosuppressive agent that exerts its effects through competitive interleukin-2 antagonism [19]. When administered as an induction therapy during the early postoperative period, in conjunction with one or more conventional immunosuppressive drugs, decreases in the incidences of acute transplant rejection and DGF and improvements in survival of the transplanted kidney have been reported [12], [13], [14], [15]. Decreases in steroid and calcineurin inhibitor doses have also been reported [15], [20], [21]. These marked changes in immunosuppressive treatments and postoperative renal function may have reduced the incidence of ONFH. The proportion of ONFH patients receiving steroid treatment for renal transplantation has reportedly decreased recently according to the multicenter hospital-based sentinel monitoring system for ONFH in Japan [22], although the reasons for these decreases in the proportion of ONFH patients receiving renal transplantation remain unclear. In addition, only a small number of reports since 2001 have described MRI screening for ONFH after RT, and the impact of the introduction of basiliximab on the post-transplant incidence of ONFH has yet to be determined. We therefore investigated the incidence of ONFH since the advent of regular basiliximab use and found that postoperative renal graft function had improved, and the MPSL dose and incidence of DGF as risk factors for ONFH had decreased. In addition, the incidence of ONFH had decreased. Basiliximab seems likely to indirectly reduce the incidence of ONFH by reducing the incidence of DGF and allowing reductions in MPSL administration.",

First, the number of renal transplant recipients with use of basiliximab might be too small to evaluate its effect on the incidence of ONFH. The number of patients included in previous MRI screening studies ranged from 26 to 150 [3], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], so the number of patients in the present study is comparable with the numbers in those studies. Second, MRI screening was not performed before RT, so we could not be sure that ONFH had not been present prior to transplantation. Nevertheless, because the incidence of ONFH in our study was lower than that in any previous study evaluated using MRI, the incidence was presumed to have also been low even before transplantation. Third, the timing of MRI screening was earlier compared to other MRI screening studies. This might be one reason the incidence of ONFH at our institute was lower than described in other reports performed during a similar period. We did not encounter any symptomatic cases with ONFH in which MRI had been negative at 3 months after RT, so we considered that the incidence of ONFH occurring after 3 months after RT was unlikely to have been particularly high.",

To date, cumulative steroid dose as of 2 weeks postoperatively has been reported as the shortest-term risk factor for ONFH [24]. The risk factors for ONFH after RT in the present study were in accordance with past findings. This result suggests that ONFH occurs mostly within the first 2 weeks after RT, suggesting the importance of controlling postoperative graft function and reducing cumulative MPSL administration in the first 2 weeks after RT using immunosuppressive agents that are appropriate for the prevention of ONFH.",

No evidence of a significant correlation between cumulative corticosteroid dose and incidence of ONFH has yet been provided [26], [27]. In renal transplant recipients, daily steroid dose is gradually tapered according to the immunosuppressive regimen, so reflecting an overall picture of steroid treatment using a mean value for daily steroid dose is difficult. In addition, duration of steroid treatment and overall cumulative steroid dose vary widely among renal recipients, and steroid administration after onset of ONFH might be included in the regression analysis. We therefore focused on the correlation between steroid administration including oral steroid administration and pulsed steroid therapy in the 8 weeks after renal transplantation and onset of ONFH at 3 months.",

Since the introduction of basiliximab, immunosuppressive therapy has changed markedly and renal graft control has also been enhanced, which may have led to decreases in the incidence of ONFH.",
