The ability to detect febrile illness in a community would be valuable in public health surveillance if surveillance could be performed routinely, with sufficient accuracy, and at low cost. For example, an increase in the number or percentage of patients with fever compared to a baseline number could alert public health officials to an outbreak of a known or new disease or to a terroristic threat.",

Knowledge of the fever status of patients would be particularly helpful when combined with other information about their symptoms or clinical characteristics. For example, knowing the presence of fever is crucial in determining whether a patient has Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [20], [21], [22]. However, to our knowledge no one has measured the accuracy at which fever status can be determined automatically from routinely collected data.",

Applying text processing techniques to the field of biosurveillance is a fairly new area of research in medical informatics that has focused on processing free-text chief complaints recorded in the emergency department [26], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. In this study, we evaluated the performance of three free-text processing algorithms to detect fever from triage chief complaints (Keyword CC and CoCo) and from the text of the patient\u2019s emergency department report (Keyword HP).",

First, it is possible that some febrile patients presenting to the ED do not yet complain of fever but are experiencing other constitutional symptoms that typically occur with a fever. Second, because chief complaints are short phrases that are designed to represent the most pertinent symptoms rather than to give a complete description of a patient\u2019s clinical condition, even when a patient reports fever to the triage nurse, a word indicating fever may not be included in the chief complaint. The CoCo algorithm represents a potentially more sensitive algorithm for detecting patients with a fever even though fever is not indicated in the chief complaint.

The reason CoCo did not accurately classify these patients as having a constitutional syndrome\u2014in spite of CoCo\u2019s being trained to classify chief complaints with fever as constitutional\u2014involves the current method CoCo uses for determining the best syndromic classification when multiple classifications exist. Currently, CoCo selects the single syndromic classification with the highest probability. Thus, chief complaints such as rash/fever, nausea/vomiting/fever, or fever and headaches were classified as rash, gastrointestinal, and neurological, respectively, because the posterior probabilities for those syndromes were higher than the probabilities for constitutional syndrome.",
