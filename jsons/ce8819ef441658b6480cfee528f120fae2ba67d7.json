Thus far, there is no approved therapeutic drug, specifically targeting this emerging virus. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a panel of human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). These antibodies were selected from a phage display library constructed using peripheral circulatory lymphocytes collected from patients at the acute phase of the disease. These neutralizing antibodies are shown to recognize distinct epitopes on the viral spike RBD, therefore they represent a promising basis for the design of efficient combined post-exposure therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The S2 subunit mediates the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, essential for viral entry into the cell. The receptor interaction site on S1 is considered the main target for efficient neutralization of cell infection and therefore a prime candidate for therapeutic antibody development [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .

Consequently, the selected mAbs, were classified on the basis of their epitope specificity determined by BLI epitope binning. In this assay, each individual antibody was biotinylated, immobilized to a streptavidin sensor, loaded with RBD and then challenged with each of the other antibodies.

CR3022 IgG was immobilized to the BLI sensor, loaded with RBD and further challenged with each of the selected mAbs. Group I mAbs were found to compete with the CR3022 as evidenced by the lack of interaction with the mAb-RBD complex ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The remaining five tested mAbs did bind the RBD in the presence of the CR3022 antibody.

Streptavidin-coated biosensors were loaded with biotinylated antibody (1-5 \u00b5g/ml) to reach 0.7-1 nm wavelength shift followed by a wash. The sensors were then reacted for 300 seconds with increasing concentrations of RBD (association phase) and then transferred to buffer-containing wells for another 600 seconds (dissociation phase). Binding and dissociation were measured as changes over time in light interference after subtraction of parallel measurements from unloaded biosensors. Sensorgrams were fitted with a 1:1 binding model using the Octet data analysis software 8.1 (Fortebio, USA, 2015), and the presented values are an average of several repeated measurements. For the binning experiments of antibodies pairs, antibody-loaded sensors were incubated with a fixed RBD concentration (300 nM), washed and incubated with the non-labeled antibody counterpart.
