Functional variants were selected by binding to p53, and disruption of the binding then screened for by a guanidine library based on the batzelladine alkaloids. One of the simpler library members was capable of effective binding to the allelome and less likely to be inactive upon protein mutation. Significance: The anthracene tagged reagent was used in enantioselective crotylations. Afterwards, the product was captured onto a supported maleimide resin, and oxidative cleavage released an aldehyde for further iterative crotylation.",
