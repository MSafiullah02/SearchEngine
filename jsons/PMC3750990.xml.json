Many human pathogens of major medical and economic importance belong to these virus families. For instance, the family Picornaviridae includes enterovirus (enterovirus, EV; coxsackievirus, CV; poliovirus, PV), human rhinovirus (HRV), and hepatitis A virus (HAV).1, 2 Non-polio enteroviruses are responsible for 10\u201315 million symptomatic infections in the US each year,3 while HRV is the major causative agent of upper respiratory tract infections.4 In the Coronaviridae family, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoA) is a recognized global threat to public health.5 Noroviruses belong to the Norovirus genus of the Caliciviridae family and are highly contagious human pathogens that are the most common cause of food borne and water borne acute viral gastroenteritis.6 Thus, norovirus infection constitutes an important public health problem. There are currently no vaccines (except for poliovirus) or specific antiviral agents for combating infections caused by the aforementioned viruses; thus, there is an urgent and unmet need for the discovery and development of broad spectrum small-molecule therapeutics and prophylactics for these important pathogens.7, 8, 9, 10\n",

Likewise, the \u223c30 kb genome of SARS-CoV comprises both nonstructural and structural regions. Two polyproteins (designated as pp1a and pp1ab) encoded by the viral genome undergo proteolytic processing by two proteases: a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3C-like protease, 3CLpro) and a papain-like protease (PLpro), to generate functionally active proteins. Finally, the 7\u20138 kb RNA genome of noroviruses encodes a polyprotein that is processed by a 3C-like protease (3CLpro) to generate mature proteins.11 Although there is high genetic diversity among these viruses, 3Cpro and 3CLpro are highly conserved, as well as essential for virus replication.",

Cyclization was subsequently accomplished using click chemistry.32, 33, 34, 35 Thus, fragment 2 was synthesized by coupling (L) Boc-protected propargyl glycine with (L) leucine methyl ester using EDCI/HOBt/DIEA/DMF to yield the dipeptidyl ester which was subsequently treated with dry HCl in dioxane to remove the N-terminal Boc protecting group. Reaction with benzylchloroformate yielded the Cbz-protected ester which was hydrolyzed with LiOH in aqueous THF to yield the corresponding acid 2. EDCI-mediated coupling of commercially available (L) Boc-Glu-OCH3 with NH2(CH2)nN3 (n\n = 3), followed by removal of the Boc group, yielded fragment 4.36 The amino alkyl azide was conveniently synthesized by converting BocNH(CH2)nOH to the mesylate via treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine, followed by reaction with sodium azide in DMF and removal of the protective group. Coupling of fragment 2 with 4 using standard coupling conditions yielded acyclic precursor 5 which was treated with Cu(I)Br/DBU in dichloromethane to furnish compound 6 in 45% yield. Compound 6 was treated with lithium borohydride to yield alcohol 7 (84% yield) which, upon Dess\u2013Martin periodinane oxidation,37 and subsequent purification gave macrocyclic aldehyde 8 (Scheme 1, structure (I), n\n = 3, R = isobutyl, X = CHO), as a white solid.38 The inhibitory activity of aldehyde 8 was evaluated in vitro as previously described.16, 39, 40, 41, 42 Compound 8 displayed inhibitory activity against NV 3CLpro (IC50 5.1 \u03bcM), enterovirus (CVB3 Nancy strain) 3Cpro (1.8 \u03bcM), and SARS-CoV 3CLpro (IC50 15.5 \u03bcM).",

Thus, the receptor structures were prepared from the following protein data bank (PDB) crystal structures: (A) NV 3CLpro from 2IPH,17 (B) CV 3C pro from 3ZZB,43 and (C) SARS-CoV 3CLpro from 2ZU5.44 These three receptor models were chosen by virtue of having cocrystallized ligands that each displayed the following three features consistent with the likely binding mode of inhibitor 8: (i) a covalent attachment to the catalytically active cysteine (analogous to the terminal aldehyde in inhibitor 8), (ii) branched alkyl, as per isobutyl group in 8, and (iii) aryl (phenylalanine or Cbz), as per Cbz in 8. This permitted the intelligent prepositioning of inhibitor 8 into each of the three protease receptors, which was accomplished in pymol\n45 via manual docking. pymol was then used to produce a computational framework for refining the docked conformation as follows: a ligand\u2013receptor complex was generated by protonating the preliminary receptor\u2013ligand complex (according to physiological pH with anionic aspartate and glutamate residues, and cationic lysine and arginine residues), then retaining only the ligand plus all complete residues with at least one atom located within no more than 6.0 \u00c5 from any ligand atom. The resulting complex models were then permitted to undergo 1000 molecular mechanics optimization steps in Avogadro46 using the MMFF94 force field and electrostatic charge model.47 The resulting complexes were then rendered in pymol. The computational studies indicate that inhibitor 8 is capable of nestling snugly in the active site of the 3C and 3CL proteases.",
