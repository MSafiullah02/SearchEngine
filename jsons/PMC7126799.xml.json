The presence of diverse bioactive molecules in these plants makes them a rich source of medicine (Kothari et al., 2010, Tiwari et al., 2015). It has been reported in the literature that about 80% of the world's population, mainly the developing countries depend on plants to meet their primary health care (Akinsulire et al., 2007). Plants possess primary and secondary metabolites. Primary metabolites are peptides, carbohydrates or sugar, lipids that are directly used in their synthesized form by plants whereas secondary metabolites are synthesized from primary metabolites (Tiwari et al., 2016). Plant secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, terpenes etc, have shown to have different properties (Mors et al., 2000, Tiwari et al., 2016).",

Hence novel antibacterial compounds are urgently needed with new bacterial targets. Different approaches have been tried (Solanki and Tiwari, 2018, Tiwari et al., 2017a, Tiwari et al., 2017b, Tiwari et al., 2018a, Tiwari et al., 2018c, Tiwari and Tiwari, 2015;) but few of them got the positive result. Some plant active compounds destabilize the structure of various target proteins, resulting in the death of disease-causing bacteria (Cowan, 1999, Ernawati et al., 2013, Tyagi et al., 2015) while some active phytochemical compounds alter the affinity of bacterial toxin or cell to the receptor of the host cell (Rafsanjany et al., 2015). Traditional herbal medicines can also act as a potential antiviral and antifungal agents that provide molecules with drug-like properties and incredible structural diversity (Rajbhandari et al., 2009). Active phytoconstituents can work either at the cellular or molecular level. Plant-derived molecules should target biochemical features of invading pathogens, which are not possessed by the normal host cell (Samy and Gopalakrishnakone, 2010, Zhang et al., 2012).",

The plant consists of multiple compounds like glycosides, alkaloids, terpenoids, etc which are known to exert therapeutic effects (Kothari et al., 2010). Therefore, it is imperative to review the impact of herbal-active compounds on the conformation stability and expression of the proteins. In the present review, we have presented various herbal active compounds that stabilize and destabilize proteins associated with different diseases. We have also reviewed molecules that alter the expression of the various proteins related to pathogenesis. Hence, a detailed understanding of this topic might result in the development of novel drugs or new herbal active compounds. Here, we have highlighted various phytoconstituents that can alter the stability and expression of proteins involved in the prokaryotic systems, proteins that alter during neurodegenerative diseases, proteins that have an essential role and involved in cell signalling. Understanding these alterations in the stability and expression of such proteins might leads to therapeutics to control conformation and expression associated with pathological or diseased conditions.",

Curcumin correlates with its ability to bind to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a potential ligand. Binding of curcumin promotes expression of cathelicidin, an antimicrobial peptide and kills the bacteria. Cathelicidin is a small peptide with some structural similarities with other antimicrobial proteins, such as defensin. Curcumin also increases mRNA expression of cAMP, which in turn increases cathelicidin level in tissues thereby curing infections caused by Salmonella typhi. Moreover, curcumin also exhibits antibacterial activity against a number of pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus by damaging their bacterial membrane (Tyagi et al., 2015). FtsZ is a prokaryotic homolog of eukaryotic cytoskeletal protein tubulin and polymerizes to form a Z-ring at the mid-cell, which orchestrates cell division in bacteria. This compound strongly inhibits the formation of cytokinetic Z-ring in B. subtilis without detectably affecting the segregation and organization of the nucleoids. Assembly dynamics of FtsZ protofilaments play a significant role in the formation and functioning of Z-ring. Curcumin inhibits the assembly of FtsZ protofilaments, and also increases GTPase activity of FtsZ, thereby affecting bacterial proliferation and finally death (Rai et al., 2008).",

The heat-labile enterotoxin is the major virulence factor of ETEC. GM1 cell surface receptor is the docking site for cholera toxin and enterotoxin of E. coli (Arlt et al., 2013). GM1 is the \"prototype\u201d ganglioside that has one sialic acid residue. LT (heat-labile enterotoxin) consists of one \u2018A\u2019 subunit for catalytic activity and five \u2018B\u2019 subunits for binding to the receptor. Binding of B-subunit (LT-B) of the toxin to GM1 of the intestinal cell surface induces a conformational change in the toxin. This is followed by translocation of A-subunit (LT-A) into cells. Inside intestinal cells, LT-A catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of stimulatory GTP-binding protein that results in increased intracellular levels of cyclic-AMP. The elevated levels of c-AMP in the cells result in massive loss of fluid and ions from cells leading to diarrhea. Zingerone binds at the binding sites of GM1 receptor and disrupting the interaction, hence A-subunit cannot be transported, finally curing diarrhea (Chen et al., 2007).",

MATE family efflux pump, use proton motive force (PMF) energy for export, and loss of the PMF inactivates pump activity and resulting in the enhanced accumulation of substrates. This accumulation increases susceptibility to the agents commonly recognized and effluxed by the transporter. The N. gonorrhoeae NorM transporter is homologous to efflux pump of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and YdhE of E. coli, when expressed in the E. coli; it enhances the efflux of various antibiotics. When berberine exposed to recombinant E. coli with NorM or YdhE as the transgene, both transporters enhanced antibiotics accumulation in the cell through a mechanism requiring the proton motive force. Hence, it can be said that these transporters bind to berberine with dissociation constants in the micro-molar range and destabilize the efflux pumps, therefore, showing a strong role in drug therapy (Long et al., 2008).",

It was found that protective effect of VA is associated with decreased reactive oxygen species levels is downstream apoptotic signaling pathways (i.e decrease in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio) that prevent proteolysis of PARP by caspases, thereby protect from neurodegenerative diseases (Kim et al., 2011).",

Heat shock proteins (HSP), are highly conserved proteins and play a significant role in protecting cells from adverse environmental, chemical, and physical stresses. HSP-70 and HSP-90 are two identified HSPs that can be used as targets for the treatment of cancer. HSP-70 is the significant stress-inducible HSP, which renders cells resistant to several chemotherapeutic drugs. Increased level of HSP-70 in the cancerous cell has shown to confer resistance to apoptosis (Phillips et al., 2007). Triptolide possibly interacts with the regulatory elements caspase-3 which are responsible for elevated expression of HSP-70 in cancer cells that may be different from that involved in the overexpression of HSP-70 during the heat shock response. It decreases the mRNA level of HSP-70 that increases the cyt-C release and in turn induces apoptosis. Similarly, HSP-90 is a highly abundant molecular chaperone in the stress response; include trans-membrane tyrosine kinases metastable signaling proteins, mutated signaling proteins, chimeric signaling proteins, cell cycle regulators and steroid receptors (Phillips et al., 2007). Similarly, epigallocatechin-3-gallate [(\u2212)-EGCG], the most abundant polyphenoliccatechin, shows chemoprevention and anticancer activities. This molecule binds to the C-terminus of HSP-90 at the region of amino acids 538\u2013728 on Hsp-90. Binding of EGCG to HSP-90 impairs the association of HSP-90 with its co-chaperones (HSP-70 and p-23), thereby inducing degradation of HSP-90 client proteins, resulting in anti-proliferative effect in pancreatic cancer cells (Li et al., 2009).",

These active compounds can also bind or block the site responsible for binding of the pathogenic element.
