As an example, the Intelligence Hazard Mitigation Team identified two sites for priority attention.

Each of these occurrences receive different levels of funding.1 On the positive side, Marin County actively included mitigation into recovery efforts. They created landslide-protection zones and required that prospective home buyers receive mandatory notification of stability problems.1\n",

When Hurricane Gilbert struck, there occurred not only the destruction from the hurricane but also subsequent significant flooding and landslides. Many Jamaicans lived in highly vulnerable locations.

In a small local disaster, volunteer organizations such as the Red Cross and private insurers may be enough to aid victims. When a disaster overwhelms the recovery forces of a community, that community can turn to the state government, and ultimately to FEMA, for resources. Within the first 48 hours of a disaster, an assessment team should provide an initial assessment of the damage. This includes identifying immediate needs such as food, shelter, and infrastructure. A preliminary damage assessment by the local government will determine whether federal aid may be needed and should be requested. Once the immediate needs are identified, and if federal aid is requested, a second, more in-depth survey should be done by FEMA. This second survey should include asking the plans of the displaced citizens: Do they plan to move, or rebuild in the same spot? Public infrastructure, sewers, and storm drains should be examined. What about the town? What was there before the disaster? What currently exists? Were there any existing plans for expansion of the area that could be used for rebuilding? What are opportunities looking at the long term?10\n",

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.11 In 2000 there were 45 major disaster declarations made in 31 states and the District of Columbia.12 These disasters ranged from tornadoes to wildfires to winter storms. Initial response resources include food, water, emergency generators, and the mobilization of specialized teams (e.g., search and rescue, medical assistance, damage assessment, and communications). For more long-term relief, there are loans and grants to repair or replace housing and personal property, roads, and public buildings. There is also assistance for mitigation opportunities, counseling, and legal services. These services are outlined in the Federal Response Plan (FRP), which describes the policies and plans of 25 federal departments and the U.S. Red Cross.11 The FRP can be implemented in conjunction with other specialized groups including plans for telecommunications support, the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan, and the Terrorism Incident Annex.11 In addition to the FRP, some federal agencies have the authority to provide disaster aid even when the magnitude is not sufficient for the president to declare a federal disaster, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Small Business Association (SBA). The FRP employs a multiagency operations structure based on the Incident Command System (ICS). (See Chapter 30, The Incident Command System.) Disaster Field Offices under the Department of Homeland Security may be created along with a national emergency response team. Recovery efforts are the responsibility of logistics and administration teams within the disaster field offices.",

It is often the most costly element of recovery, and typically the cost is shared with the state in a 75%/25% split.6\n3.Hazard mitigation grant program10: These grants are used by the federal, state, and local governments to incorporate mitigation into the recovery process. Actions may include acquisition of homes, public education, and retrofitting structures to better resist subsequent disasters such as floods and hurricanes. Cost will be shared between federal and state resources.6\n\n",

This is referred to as \u201ctop down\u201d theory.9 In addition to not providing the optimal care, this may impede the self-sufficiency of these disaster-struck areas. Assumptions may be made, including the following: (1) the victims are a burden; (2) the host government is weak and cannot manage alone; (3) foreign aid organizations don't require accountability; (4) aid for the victims reflect the defined needs of the victims (when, in fact, the aid reflects the projected need by the donor).9 An example of this last point was when Hurricane Hugo struck Montserrat in 1989. Ninety-eight percent of all homes were affected, 50% severely and 20% completely destroyed.9 The Peace Corps brought in large numbers of prefabricated housing to replace all the destroyed homes. Although they were able to help a lot of people numerically, the homes they provided had two-sided pitched roofs instead of the typical Caribbean four-sided roofs that were better able to withstand tropical winds. They also did not have an interior design to allow for cross ventilation. The early recipients of the homes reported this finding to the Peace Corps, but the Peace Corps was unable to change the design. Though well intentioned, the Peace Corps was predominantly meeting the need projected by the donors instead of the actual needs of the victims.9\n",

In Jamaica, after Hurricane Gilbert, the primary housing aid program was the Building Stamp Programme, which was set up by the Jamaican government, the World Bank, Canada, Germany, Japan, OPEC, and the United States. Homeowners were issued building stamps based on the extent of damages and financial need. These stamps would then be redeemed only at building supply stores who were members of the Jamaican Hardware Merchants Association for building materials, including zinc sheets, nails, and lumber. Squatters and renters were not eligible for stamps and were left without any recourse for finding aid. People who were not at home during the time of the survey were not listed as needing aid.9 Additionally, it was found that the stamps were distributed unequally. As a result, many needy people were left without any support.",

Studies have shown that many community plans focus primarily on the emergency period and do not give adequate attention to recovery and reconstruction. If there is a plan, it often exists on paper only and in the case of an actual disaster it is not used. In fact, many officials are not aware that a plan exists.4 These flaws lead to chaotic implementation of an ad hoc recovery. The community lacks the ability to work together and thus fragments and cannot unify to control its own affairs. As a result, the redevelopment is likely to be inadequate to fulfill the needs of the community. If there is aid from government and nongovernmental groups, they are sometimes uncoordinated, either duplicating actions, leaving areas without any aid,4 or giving aid that is inadequate for the needs of the area. In Saragossa, Texas, a small isolated community that was devastated by a tornado in 1987, there was no local government in place at all. When a disaster advisory board was created, it was done without any input from the local inhabitants. The outcome was that the Saragossans considered themselves worse off 2 years after the tornado than they had been beforehand, both because of the quality of the rebuilt neighborhoods and because they felt they were looked on as helpless and ungrateful.2\n",

When a plan is in place before a disaster, it allows for a strong horizontal network. Then, when a useful vertical element is added, the results can work wonders. By 1975 recurrent floods had repeatedly decimated the town of Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin. Each time they rebuilt. At one point they added a dam, and they planned for a levee but were unable because of financial restrictions. They decided they would take the funds allocated for the levee and use it to plan for town relocation. Although federal funds were slow in coming, they did create a plan. In 1978, when the largest flood in the history of the area occurred, they were ready with a fully written strategy. When they were granted funds for reconstruction, they put their plan into effect. Not only did they relocate out of the flood plain to prevent reoccurrence of this destruction, but they decided to create a town that was 75% solar powered.5 Because they had had the luxury of time in the planning stage, they had asked each business owner where they wanted to be located and how they wanted their business to be built. As a result, the town became not only exactly what the community wanted, but its creation instilled a great sense of pride and satisfaction in its citizens, thus creating a happier community as well.",
