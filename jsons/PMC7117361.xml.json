Experimental infections with PED virus isolates have indicated that the virus is a primary etiologic agent of diarrhea in pigs (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980, Debouck et al., 1981, Coussement et al., 1982). The principal features of PED are watery diarrhea, dehydration and high mortality in suckling pigs.",

Further outbreaks occurred between late 1993 and 1996 (Sueyoshi et al., 1995, Tsuda, 1997). In an acute outbreak of PED in 1996, more than the 39,000 suckling pigs died (Tsuda, 1997).",

However, attempts at isolating PED virus in porcine cell cultures in the presence or absence of trypsin have been unsuccessful until now. Previous reports suggested that porcine cell cultures were damaged by trypsin, which then might not be able to support virus replication (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988). In the present study, collagen-coated plates were used; cells cultured on collagen-coated plates are more resistant to trypsin (data not shown). This might be the main reason for the successful isolation of PED virus in porcine cell cultures in the present study. This method may be suitable for cell culture in medium containing trypsin or other proteinases.",

In the present study, however, severe diarrhea was only observed in 2- and 7-day old pigs. The difference in the clinical signs between field cases and the present examination may reflect differences in the infectious dose, the susceptibility of pigs, the environmental conditions or the virulence of the strains. The majority of herd outbreaks of PED occur during the colder months, especially between January and April (Tsuda, 1997). In TGE virus infection, (Shimizu et al., 1978, Shimizu and Shimizu, 1979) showed that a high ambient temperature resulted in increased disease resistance, while a low ambient temperature or temperature changes caused a dramatic enhancement in clinical signs. In the present study, 2\u201312-week old pigs were kept at 23\u201324\u00b0C throughout the study. Consequently, a stable comfortable ambient temperature might induce resistance to clinical disease after PED virus infection.",
