            "text": "Respiratory viruses including; influenza virus types A and B (Flu A/B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), adenovirus (AdV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus (hCoV), human bocavirus (hBoV) and human parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2 and 3 (hPIV1-3), have been singly or jointly detected from patients suffering from respiratory diseases [2], [3], [4], [5]. Incidence studies have indicated that 15-38% of respiratory infections develop into acute lower respiratory infections (ARIs) with severe signs and symptoms including wheezing, bronchiolitis, croup, high fever and pneumonia with subsequent increases in hospitalization to a general ward (GW), admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or mortality [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. A number of factors have been attributed to the severity of respiratory viral disease including; underlying chronic diseases such as chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, chronic liver disease, chronic heart disease, chronic renal disease; and other factors such as immunodeficiency, old age, young age, pregnancy, viral genome mutations [11], [12], [13], [14]. There are suggestions that the presence of more than one type of virus in the respiratory specimen may also affect the clinical presentation of respiratory tract infection [15], [16], [17], [18]. However, the relationship between co-infection and severity of illness remains unclear. This review investigates the relation between co-infection in general and co-infection between influenza and other respiratory viruses and clinical outcome.",

Some viral co-infections of low severity influence the estimates of co-infection patterns, this resulted in bias of severe illness towards the null, when crude analysis is applied. Infact it could also be possible that the variations in Cilla et al., [21] and Venter et al., [29] and also between Martin et al., [20] and Drews et al., [25] were also partly due to bias towards the null.

However all the 3 studies used RT-PCR for identification of viruses. The difference in their findings could therefore be either because of the variability in the number and types of viruses they investigated, or due to the age differences of recruited patients. Boivin et al., [23] recruited patients infected with Flu A/B, RSV A/B, AdV, hMPV and PIV1-4, to which Singleton et al., [28] and Do et al., [31] also included hCoV. This observation suggests that in children <3 years, coronaviruses cause disease of different severity than in teens.

There is insufficient evidence in support of an association or lack of association between influenza A virus and other respiratory viruses\u2019 co-infection and severity of disease outcome. Thus whilst Boivin et al., [23] reported a statistically significant association between co-infection and increased risk of bronchiolitis (OR: 4.69, 95% CI: 1.38 \u2013 15.95, p = 0.01), Singleton et al., [28] found it was protective (OR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.18 \u2013 0.99, p = 0.05) despite the two studies having recruited children < 3 years old and used RT-PCR for virus identification. On the other hand, Camargo et al., [35] and Singleton et al., [28] found that co-infection was actually protective against admission to ICU, however this was also not statistically significant. There is therefore a need for a larger well designed study investigating the impact of co-infection on the outcome of influenza disease.",

The crude analysis adopted by many authors could have introduced bias towards the null i.e. some viral co-infections of low severity influenced the estimates of co-infection patterns towards the null when crude analysis was applied. Future studies should employ stratified analysis on the effect of co-infections on disease outcome where effects of specific pairs of viruses e.g. Flu A/RSV, RSV/hMPV or RSV/AdV are investigated so as to elucidate the type of virus pairs which increase or decrease disease severity. The variations could also be because of the differences in the co-infection patterns because of the differences in types of viruses that circulated in different seasons and years the different studies were conducted; Influenza A viruses, RSV, hMPV and AdV follow seasonal patterns, with higher virus activity in winters and minimal activity in summers, RV circulate all year round whereas hPIV1-4 are predominantly in summer, and the studies included here spanned over different time periods.",

Respiratory virus proteins are detected by host cell tall like receptors; TL2, TLR4 and TLR6; TLR3 TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 and by the protein kinase RNA - activated (PKR), the melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MAD-5), the retinoic inducible gene I (RIG-I) and the 2\u2019,5\u2019-Oligoadenylate synthetase (2\u2019,5\u2019-OAS1&2) which in turn triggers host production of cytokines including; tumour necrosis factor (TNF), type 1 proinflammatory cytokines; interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1), and interferon-beta (IFN-\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-18 (IL-18) [11], [45], [46], which counteract virus infection. Depending on the type of virus, infection may lead to cytokine storm resulting into severe disease characterised by organ failure. Casalegno et al., [46] and other researcher [47], [48] suggested that rhinoviruses interfered with circulation of other viruses, and some studies [15], [18] indicated that co-infections with rhinoviruses resulted in low risk. However the precise mechanisms in co-infections that may affect virulence are not well understood and more research is needed to understand the biomedical processes in respiratory virus co-infections and the co-infection patterns that may increase or decrease virulence.",

It is possible that patients could have presented with different signs and symptoms. The use of proxies for measuring disease severity e.g. hospitalisation or death, other than signs and symptoms, could avoid these problems. It is possible that some of the co-infections indicated by different studies were nosocomial infections, however, in all the included studies, ascertainment of disease status was performed during the time of hospitalisation or during the first consultation, ruling out the possibility of nosocomial infections. Also the possibilities of publication and study selection bias should be born in mind. Conversely, we employed a standard search strategy, making sure that we are able to capture all the possible studies covering the subject under study. The search was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE and WEB of Science, databases which summarise publication in a wide variety of medical journals. We also manually searched studies of good quality to include in the review and in this way hope to have eliminated any study selection or publication bias.",
