The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiological behavior of HMPV in Mexico. This retrospective study was conducted over a nine-year period and used 7283 influenza-negative respiratory samples from hospitalized and deceased patients who presented Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). The samples were processed with the help of qualitative multiplex RT-PCR for simultaneous detection of 14 respiratory viruses (xTAG \u00ae RVP FAST v2). 40.8% of the samples were positive for respiratory viruses, mainly rhinovirus/enterovirus (47.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (15.9%), HMPV (11.1%) and parainfluenza virus (8.9%). Other respiratory viruses and co-infections accounted for 16.5%. HMPV infects all age groups, but the most affected group was infants between 29 days and 9 years of age (65.6%) and adults who are 40 years and older (25.7%). HMPV circulates every year from November to April, and the highest circulation was observed in late winter. The results of this study aim to raise awareness among clinicians about the high epidemiological impact of HMPV in young children and older individuals in order to reduce the economic burden in terms of health care costs.",

Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are the most common viral agents associated with ARIs, accounting for around 70% of all ARIs [1] . All these viral pathogens are associated with acute lower respiratory infections and create a substantial burden of disease, particularly in young children (<5 years), older individuals (\u226565 years) and immune-compromised patients. HMPV has been detected in 4-16% of hospitalizations of children suffering from ARIs. Serologic surveys revealed that primary HMPV infection is common, as antibodies were detected in over 90% of individuals between 5 and 10 years of age [2, 3] . A total of 57.4% (190/331) of the positive samples of HMPV were pharyngeal swab, 39% (129/331) were nasopharyngeal swab, 3.3% (11/331) were bronchioalveolar washes and 0.3% (1/331) were biopsies. 89% of the HMPV positive samples (297/331) were taken during the first five days of the onset of symptoms, and 10.3% (34/331) were taken six to 10 days after the onset of symptoms. In females, there were 55% of positive cases of HMPV, while this was 45% in males.",

Each population of Luminex microspheres detects a highly specific viral target or analysis control by means of a specific anti-tag/tag hybridization. After incubation of the RT-PCR products with the microsphere mixture, the Luminex instrument classifies and reads the hybridization/detection reactions. A medium fluorescence intensity (MFI) signal is generated for each population of microspheres (viral target or analysis control).
