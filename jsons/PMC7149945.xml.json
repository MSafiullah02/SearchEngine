There are a number of viruses known to cause respiratory infections. The most notable of these are influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, adenovirus, human coronavirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The emergence of novel viral respiratory pathogens with high mortality rates, such as influenza A (H5N1) and SARS-CoV, has brought new focus on the virology laboratory's role in diagnosis. This chapter describes the application of molecular diagnostic methods designed to detect a large number of these viruses, often more rapidly and with a higher degree of sensitivity than conventional methods.

Antibody detection is often of limited use as most serologic assays rely on the comparison of acute and convalescent sera, preventing rapid diagnosis. Rapid enzyme immunoassays (EIA) are commercially available for influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These tests are primarily used at outpatient sites and emergency departments due to their rapid turn-around time; however, they suffer from limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Over the past few decades, diagnosis of the most common respiratory viruses has typically involved the direct examination of respiratory specimens using fluorescent antibodies (FA) and the inoculation of those samples into various cell lines growing in tubes and more recently in shell vials. Tube cultures allow one to observe the cell layers over a period of several days or weeks for cytopathic effect (CPE), reflecting viral growth. Many common respiratory viral pathogens exhibit typical CPE patterns, allowing presumptive identification. Confirmation of viral identity may be made using FA staining of the cell layer. Sometimes ancillary tests, such as hemadsorption, are necessary for detection and identification. Shell vial cultures (SVC) can allow much more rapid detection. SVCs are made up of dram vials containing a coverslip with a monolayer of cells covered by culture medium. Respiratory samples are inoculated into the vial, which is then centrifuged to hasten viral attachment to the cell layer. Results from SVCs are usually available in 1 to 2 days. FA is even faster (3\u201318 hours) but suffers from a loss in sensitivity compared to culture-based methods. These techniques are all quite labor-intensive and require highly trained staff to perform. Tube culture methods remain the most sensitive, but even with prolonged incubation they may miss many infections.",

Other amplification methods will be presented, such as isothermal methods of nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The potential advantages of these methods come with significant challenges, however, as there may be a need for effective simultaneous detection of an increasingly broad spectrum of respiratory viral pathogens. If one is looking to replace FA and culture, this equates to a minimum of seven or eight individual PCR tests. Adding in newly described agents of potential clinical significance increases this number to between 15 and 20. The challenge of developing, validating, and implementing such a broad array of simultaneous molecular tests is great, and the cost may well be prohibitive.",

Again, this apparent solution creates another set of challenges. As the number of reactants (primers, probes, targets, and internal controls) in a multiplex reaction increases, it becomes more difficult to optimize the assay and maintain sensitivity and specificity. Technical boundaries are also present. The number of individual targets that can be detected in a single reaction is limited by the number of reporter molecules that can be distinguished by detection instrumentation. To adapt for this limitation, many laboratory-developed assays (LDAs) for respiratory viruses consist of a series of PCR reactions. The series may be composed of three or four separate PCR assays, each having two or three targets per reaction vessel. Another approach may be the use of newer technologies to broaden the number of targets that may be detected following end-point amplification. Some of these methods will be discussed in the following sections.",

Specimens for diagnosis of upper respiratory virus infections include nasopharyngeal aspirates or nasopharyngeal washes, nasopharyngeal swabs, and throat swabs. For the collection of swab specimens, commercially available swabs made of rayon, Dacron, polyester, and nylon are acceptable for use. Calcium alginate-tipped swabs are toxic to some viruses, and swabs with wooden handles can contain toxins and formaldehydes that may inhibit the detection of viruses. Recently, flocked swabs (Abu-Diab et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2008) have been used for the collection of large numbers of epithelial cells from the lining of the nasopharynx. The flocked swab tips are made with perpendicular nylon fibers that act like a soft brush to dislodge epithelial cells. Several commercially available media are suitable for the transport of respiratory samples. Transport medium is necessary to prevent drying of the sample, to maintain viability of the virus, and to inhibit the growth of microbial contaminants. While viral transport media, such as M4 (Remel, Lenexa, KS), require transport at 4\u00b0C, transport media have become available that allow room-temperature storage prior to use as well as transport for up to 24 hours after specimen collection\u2014for example, M4-RT (Remel, Lenexa, KS) and universal transport medium room temperature (UTM-RT) (Copan, Italia, Brescia, Italy) (Barger et al., 2005).",

A large number of respiratory epithelial cells can be obtained by proper collection of nasopharyngeal washes and aspirates, and this method is recommended for hospitalized patients, where an accurate diagnosis is critical for appropriate antiviral therapy and infection control measures. The detection of RSV, in particular, has been shown to improve with the collection of washes and aspirates rather than swabs (Sung et al., 2008). Recent studies in children have suggested that the use of flocked swabs transported in a viral transport medium provides an increase in specimen quality over other collection swabs with comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal aspirates (Abu-Diab et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2008). Walsh et al. (2008) showed there was no significant difference in sensitivity between nasopharyngeal aspirates transported in a viral transport medium and nasopharyngeal samples on flocked swabs in viral transport media. The less invasive flocked swab specimens would be an attractive alternative to nasopharyngeal aspirates, particularly in outpatient settings. Throat swabs are not a recommended specimen for molecular testing. However, molecular techniques have shown increased sensitivity in this specimen type over that seen with culture and antigen detection (Fiebelkorn and Nolte, 2004).",

CoV viral loads are greater in the lower respiratory tract during this early period of infection, but collection of these types of samples may create aerosols, which can be dangerous to medical staff. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), during the first week of infection, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens and plasma/serum should all be tested.

Both DNA and RNA are degraded enzymatically by DNA- and RNA-specific nucleases (DNases and RNases), so proper handling of the sample is the first step for ensuring the isolation of high-quality nucleic acid. This is especially important when purifying RNA because of the inherent instability of the RNA molecule and the ubiquitous presence of RNases in the environment. The most common sources of RNase contamination are bacteria and molds, which can be introduced into the sample by contact with skin or contaminated laboratory surfaces. Gloves should be worn while handling samples and reagents, and all processing should be done using aseptic technique in a biological safety cabinet that is bleached and rinsed with alcohol before and after use. RNase-free reagents and plastic ware should be used. Unpreserved samples should be processed promptly upon receipt in the laboratory or frozen at \u201370\u00b0C (Walsh et al., 2008).

Because of the number of manual steps as well as the hazardous chemicals involved, these procedures are of limited use in the clinical laboratory. In 1999, Boom and colleagues reported an extraction method based on reversible binding of nucleic acid molecules onto silica in the presence of chaotropic salts (for example, guanidine thiocyanate). This method removes endogenous nucleases and PCR inhibitors and purifies nucleic acid from various types of clinical samples (Boom et al., 1999). Most commercially available extraction kits and automated extraction platforms are based on this method. Silica can be coated onto membrane filters or magnetic particles. Plastic columns containing silica-impregnated filters are one commonly adopted design. After an initial cell lysis and protein digestion step, the specimen is passed through the filter, which binds the nucleic acid, while residual proteins, polysaccharides, and other impurities present in the solution are removed by washing with buffers. Similar methods are based on the principle of adsorption of nucleic acid to silica-coated magnetic particles. After cell lysis and the addition of magnetic silica beads, the specimen is placed near a magnetic field. Nucleic acid is retained on the beads during the wash steps. Depending on the extraction protocol, the salt concentration and pH of the final wash buffer are adjusted to selectively elute DNA, RNA, or total nucleic acid (Qiagen, 1998). Ideally, an evaluation of the protocol should be performed for each virus and sample type that will be tested. Physical properties of the virus (for example, RNA vs. DNA, or enveloped vs. non-enveloped) as well as variations in the sample type, such as numbers of cells, viral load, and presence of mucus or other inhibitors must be considered when choosing an extraction protocol (Petrich et al., 2006).",

RNA viral nucleic acid targets must first be reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) before beginning the PCR process, a method commonly referred to as reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The PCR process is complex, and each constituent of the amplification reaction influences the efficiency and success of the outcome. Factors such as concentration of primers, template, dNTPs, and magnesium (Mg2+), the type of polymerase used, template G + C content, and cycling parameters must all be balanced for optimal performance.

TaqMan probes are labeled with a fluorescent reporter molecule on the 5\u2032 end and a quencher molecule at the 3\u2032 end. If the target is present, the quenched probe hybridizes with the target, and DNA polymerase (having 5\u2032 exonuclease activity) then digests the probe.

Molecular beacon probes also contain a fluorescent reporter and a quencher molecule, but the probe is constructed so that a secondary hairpin-loop structure is formed. Due to the secondary structure, the fluorescent reporter and quencher molecules are brought in close proximity, resulting in the quenching of fluorescence. If target is present, the probe\u2019s secondary structure is relaxed as the probe hybridizes to the target.

Target-specific primers (TSP) containing an xTAG universal tag sequence are added and hybridize with complementary target amplicons, if present.

A two-tube multiplex PCR reaction with molecular beacon probes was designed to detect seven viruses (influenza A, influenza B, RSV, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and 4) (Templeton et al., 2004). Respiratory samples (n = 358) were tested by conventional culture and this multiplex PCR assay. Nineteen percent of the samples were positive by conventional methods, while 24% were positive by PCR. The additional PCR-positive samples were confirmed by other PCR assays. The mean crossing threshold (Ct) value of the culture-negative/PCR-positive samples was 38, indicating a lower viral load than in concordant samples, which had a mean Ct of 26 (P < 0.001). Also , two dual infections were detected by PCR, but not by culture (Templeton et al, 2004). Hymas and Hillyard (2009) used a real-time PCR method to detect multiple respiratory viruses (influenza A, influenza B, and RSV), with commercial RUO reagents and a modified TaqMan method. In this system, the TaqMan probe (still with a 5\u2032 reporter molecule and a 3\u2032 quencher) also has a minor groove binding (MGB) moiety on the 5\u2032 end. Once a DNA\u2013probe hybrid is produced, the MGB moiety tucks into the minor groove. This conformation stabilizes the duplex and protects the probe from the hydrolysis process that normally occurs with TaqMan probes. With these modified TaqMan hybridization probes, the products are not hydrolyzed and are therefore available for melt curve analysis (Hymas and Hillyard, 2009). A melting temperature is the temperature at which half the population of a nucleic acid sequence is single-stranded. In melt curve analysis, the resulting melting temperatures can be specific for individual amplicon sequences. Temperatures in the referenced study were 60.4\u00b0C, 66.7\u00b0C, and 69.4\u00b0C, for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV, respectively. The results of this modified TaqMan probe and melt curve analysis showed 99% concordance with 95 samples positive by culture, FA, or an RT-PCR. The real-time PCR method using modified MGB TaqMan hybridization probes had an improved sensitivity due to its detection of seven positive samples not detected by the other three methods. The presence of the seven additional positive viruses was confirmed by other PCR assays. Lee et al. (2007) selected 101 adult respiratory samples that had been positive for either human rhinovirus (HRV), RSV, parainfluenza (PIV), influenza (InfV), or adenovirus (ADV) by conventional virological methods. The samples were reanalyzed using a commercial RUO system for multiplex PCR and another commercial RUO system for detection. The commercial systems used isoC, isoG, and microsphere flow cytometry to target eight viruses (HRV, RSV, PIV, InfV, ADV, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and enterovirus). Overall sensitivity and specificity for the method were 94% and 99%, respectively. Additionally, 103 nasal secretions from symptomatic children were analyzed by the RUO system and compared to culture and FA. Conventional methods detected virus in 23.3% of the samples. Multiplexed PCR detected virus in 71.8% of the samples. Four of the positive samples were found to have two viruses by PCR (Lee et al., 2007). In yet another study, RT-PCR with low-density arrays was used to amplify influenza A RNA, and transcripts were reacted to oligonucleotides fixed to glass slides. The accuracy of the method was 72% (Townsend et al., 2006).",

Neither of these two isothermal methods requires cycling between different temperatures for primer annealing and template elongation, rendering the use of thermal cyclers unnecessary. These methods are also characteristically more rapid than those requiring thermal cycling. In a study using the NASBA method, over 700 clinical respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal aspirates, swabs, sputa, bronchoalveolar lavages, and endotracheal aspirates) were assayed for RSV A and B using conventional FA, culture, an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), and NASBA. NASBA outperformed the other methods by detecting RSV in 29.9% of the samples versus culture (8%). FA was performed on approximately 500 samples with a 23.1% positive rate (Deiman et al., 2007). A NASBA assay for SARS-CoV showed equivalent sensitivity when compared to a real-time RT-PCR assay. NASBA had a potential advantage in terms of throughput, taking 1 hour less time to complete than RT-PCR (Keightley et al., 2005).",

Several investigators have used LAMP for detection of respiratory viral pathogens. Imai et al. (2007) used LAMP technology to detect influenza H5N1 with a reported sensitivity 10-fold higher than that reached with RT-PCR. Sensitivity of LAMP was unchanged whether using end-point fluorescent detection or real-time turbidimetric detection. CoV has been detected using the LAMP method with three sets of primers and real-time turbidimetric detection and has been reported to be 100 times more sensitive than a end-point qualitative RT-PCR followed by gel electrophoresis (Hong et al., 2004). Overall performance was comparable when detection of CoV using LAMP was compared with a quantitative real-time PCR assay (qRT-PCR), with sensitivities of 78% (qRT-PCR) and 71% (LAMP). While sensitivities were similar in samples submitted after 4 days of symptoms onset, for those samples (n = 15) taken early (1\u20133 days after onset), the detection rate was 95% for qRT-PCR and 60% for LAMP. Although this study suggested that qRT-PCR was the more sensitive method for early detection of SARS, LAMP may be more practical from a cost and complexity standpoint (no thermal cyclers, no fluorescent probes or real-time instrumentation needs), thereby suggesting its value for laboratories in resource-limited areas (Poon et al., 2005).",

The sensitivity of real-time PCR was highest (98% for RSV, 94% for influenza) (Liao et al., 2009). A comparison of the Luminex assay (RVP) with an LDA included 1,530 FA-negative respiratory samples. Forty-two percent (42%) of the samples were positive using the LDA versus 45% using RVP. However, of the viruses detected by LDA and undetected by RVP, 51% were adenovirus (n = 26); 27.5% were RSV (n = 14) and, with rare exception, were at low concentration. Additionally, the reduced detection of adenovirus may have been due to the varied serotype distribution seen in this particular geographical location and patient population (Pabbaraju et al., 2008). Other researchers have reported sensitivity of 100% with adenovirus using RVP (Mahoney et al., 2007). Commercial reagents for the detection of respiratory viruses are becoming more numerous.

It is important to include in these costs the expenses related to performance verification studies, prior to test implementation. Performance characteristics of FDA-cleared kits, other commercial reagents, as well as LDAs must be verified by each clinical laboratory before placing an assay into clinical service. LDAs typically require a more extensive, more costly validation process for the clinical laboratory than commercially produced tests. While the cost of a molecular assay can vary widely, ongoing reagent costs per test in a molecular LDA are usually less than with a molecular commercial assay. When calculating the total cost per assay, the labor involved in producing, aliquoting, labeling, and verifying the performance quality of the assay reagents before placing them into service, as well as troubleshooting the large number of variables in a multiplexed assay, can be extensive and should be included in the cost per test calculation. At the same time, packaging of commercial kits/reagents can be misleading. The actual cost per test can be substantially elevated over the vendor\u2019s proposed cost once the expense of performing the quality control required by regulatory agencies is included. Packaging configuration will increase the cost per test if the laboratory\u2019s test volume does not allow for optimal use of reagents. Also of note, patents exist for some genetic targets and royalties or licensing fees have to be paid for performing many molecular diagnostic tests. Such fees are often included in the cost of commercial kits, but they must be paid separately when using LDAs. Perhaps the preferred way to use these new multiplexed molecular methods at this time is in algorithms using both conventional and molecular methods.

In a multiplexed reaction with two or three targets, running a positive control for each target might not add a significant amount to the overall cost of an assay. However, in highly multiplexed reactions with the number of targets in the double digits, the cost can be greatly increased. If controls are not supplied in a kit, laboratories must obtain or produce their own. The availability of commercial controls is limited. Viral particles may be purchased, extracted, and diluted to a concentration that is detectable with the assay. If the laboratory has the capability of manufacturing oligonucleotides or plasmids containing the target sequence, those may also be used as controls. However, in both cases, laboratory personnel would be working with very high levels of targets, and unless a very high level of containment is practiced, the risk of assay contamination is high. To reduce cost, some laboratories test only new lots of reagents with all targets. If the reagents successfully detect all intended targets, then while these reagents are in service, the positive target controls may be rotated as a single positive target control in each assay. If a laboratory desires or is required to run a positive target control in each run, cocktails of the positive target controls can be made so that multiple targets can be run in a single tube. The number of targets per tube would have to be determined empirically in the laboratory\u2019s specific assay. If the laboratory is performing an FDA-cleared assay, the package insert should be read carefully to see if this type of control cocktail is allowed.

Patient samples may have varying levels of inhibitors present. Therefore, during assay validation, laboratories should establish a maximum acceptable IPC Ct that indicates there are no significant inhibitors in the reaction. If, after performing an assay for respiratory viruses, positive and negative controls are acceptable, a sample is negative for the viruses tested, but its IPC failed, the problem could be either that the extraction of that particular sample was inadequate or that sample contains inhibitors. If inhibitors are truly the cause of the IPC failure, this may be remedied by dilution of the sample and re-extraction. If a sample is positive for one of the targeted viruses and its IPC failed, this may be the result of a high viral load that outcompeted the IPC target for dNTPs or other reaction components.

Multiplexed molecular methods have been implemented for routine use in many clinical laboratories because of the methods' sensitivity, speed (more rapid than culture), ability to detect viruses that are difficult or impossible to culture, and ability to detect multiple viruses simultaneously. These assays are of high complexity and require a capital expenditure that may not be feasible for all laboratories. A testing algorithm that incorporates several methods may be the best strategy, but it is vital to consult all end-user groups, including medical staff, nursing, and administration, before implementation. The algorithm design would depend on the type of institution, patient demographics, how the information is going to be used for patient care, viral prevalence or seasonality in the area, whether detection of multiple viruses is important, how many viruses should be targeted, assay turn-around time, and if isolates are required for susceptibility testing. One such algorithm might be that more rapid but less sensitive antigen detection tests would be used first. This might be particularly useful in geographical regions with a high prevalence of the viruses detected by these tests. Positive results using these rapid tests would be reported and testing of those samples would stop. Samples with negative results would be tested with more sensitive assays, such as FA. Samples negative by FA would be tested by molecular diagnostics. Another algorithm might have FA as the first line of testing. Some laboratories might opt to run a multiplexed assay for those viruses considered treatable, of high clinical impact, or of high seasonal prevalence (such as influenza and RSV), while other laboratories might use a highly multiplexed assay that targets all available respiratory viral targets.",

Cell cultures are being phased out in many clinical laboratories but will remain important in order to cultivate viruses for vaccine development, analyze viruses for antigenic drift, performing susceptibility testing, and discover emerging pathogens.",

            "text": "Respiratory infections are very common. They are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality and are costly in terms of lost time from work, inappropriate use of antibiotics, and lengthy hospital stays. Laboratory detection of causative agents can influence treatment and allow appropriate infection control measures, potentially saving time and money, promoting quicker recovery for the patient, and lowering the risk of nosocomial transmission of the organism. Molecular testing may be the most sensitive method of detecting respiratory viruses. These methods have been shown to detect multiple viruses in a single sample more often than any of the other methods described and, in addition, can detect viruses that are difficult or impossible to grow. The detection of nonviable organisms may provide additional insight into disease but provides its own challenges in terms of determining clinical significance of positive results. Like many areas of clinical medicine and microbiology, the increasing use of molecular diagnostics for detection of respiratory viruses raises many new questions for the laboratory and the clinical diagnostician, but also promises many benefits as these methods become increasingly available for routine use.",

Excess nucleotides and primers are removed using shrimp alkaline phosphatase and exonuclease I. (2) Viral-specific primers with a universal tag sequence linked to their 5\u2032 end are added to the reaction. Hybridization takes place between complementary sequences. Primers are extended by target-specific primer extension (TSPE). The extension product contains biotin-dCTP. (3) Color-coded microspheres are added to the reaction. Each color of bead has an anti-tag sequence on its surface that binds a specific viral target. (4) Strepavidin\u2013phycoerythrin is added. Strepavidin binds biotin; phycoerythrin emits fluorescence. The beads are passed single-file through a flow cytometer detection chamber. The instrument uses two lasers: one spectrally classifies each bead, and the other detects any fluorescence that is associated with each bead.",
