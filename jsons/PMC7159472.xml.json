The age of the child remained related to both responses, even after adjusting for the number of respiratory infections (P = 0.05 for T lymphocytes, P = 0.09 for IL\u20104; Table 1).

This study is the first to show an age\u2010related nasal immune maturation in 0\u20132\u2010year\u2010old children, with number of Th2\u2010driving (IL\u20104) and regulatory (IL\u201010) cytokine\u2010positive cells decreasing with age. Interestingly, the percentages of nasal macrophages and T lymphocytes attracted to the nose during URTI were low until the age of 6 months, but increased rapidly thereafter with the age of the child. In 2\u2010year\u2010old children, the number of macrophages and T lymphocytes from control children and from the group of children with URTI were comparable with those in adult patients with a common cold, as reported in our previous study (20). This indicates that recruitment of inflammatory cells to the nose is in full potential at the age of 2 years. An assessment of whether the age\u2010related increase in the number of T lymphocytes in nasal brush samples is due to an increase of a particular type of T lymphocytes was not possible, but memory T lymphocytes are likely candidates. While children show high percentages of na\u00efve T lymphocytes (approximately 82%) and only few memory T lymphocytes (approximately 16%) in peripheral blood, adult T lymphocytes show the opposite phenotype (approximately 48% na\u00efve, 49% memory) (21).",

This could explain the age\u2010related increase in effector cell responses observed during URTI. Indeed, in our study, an age\u2010related decrease in Th2\u2010driving (IL\u20104) cytokine\u2010positive cells was observed in the noses of children. It is difficult to relate our in vivo data to known in vitro data obtained from cord blood and peripheral blood samples. Prescott and colleagues found an age\u2010related decrease in the expression of Th2 cytokine IL\u20104 mRNA in allergen\u2010stimulated cord blood and peripheral\u2010blood mononuclear cells in 0\u201318\u2010month\u2010old children (22). However, others found an age\u2010related increase in Th2 cytokine responses during the first year of life when peripheral blood cells were activated polyclonally or with allergen (9, 23).",

            "text": "In the present study also, the number of nasal IL\u201010\u2010positive cells decreased with age. These high IL\u201010 responses in the nose of infants are in line with studies showing a high expression of IL\u201010 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of infants compared with adults (24). The role of IL\u201010 in immune maturation is complex. IL\u201010 can inhibit the production of Th1\u2010driving cytokine IL\u201012 by dendritic cells (25), and therefore a decrease in the number of nasal IL\u201010\u2010positive cells with age would allow an age\u2010related increase in nasal IL\u201012 responses. This in turn would stimulate Th1 cytokine production, as IL\u201012 is a key factor for Th1 differentiation (26). Recently it has become clear that IL\u201010 can inhibit many more cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20102, IL\u20105, IL\u20106, IL\u201018) and therefore IL\u201010 is nowadays regarded as an important regulatory cytokine (27). In this quality high expression of IL\u201010 in infancy may induce tolerance in early life and may regulate a balanced Th1 and Th2 maturation. This regulatory role of IL\u201010 in immune maturation has already been suggested by van den Biggelaar et al. (28), who found that high production of IL\u201010 during helminth infection was inversely related to the development of Th2\u2010mediated allergic disease in children.",

Although this does not preclude an increase in protein production. Lower production of IL\u201012 protein by LPS\u2010stimulated neonatal DCs has been observed by comparison with adult DCs (29). Recently, Upham et al. (30) showed that protein production of IL\u201012p70 increased gradually from infancy to adulthood after stimulation of peripheral and cordblood cells. Unfortunately, our approach did not allow us to determine whether levels of IL\u201012 protein expression rather than cell number are upregulated.",

This concurs with findings from in vitro studies where polyclonally stimulated cord blood T lymphocytes from both groups of children did not differ in the production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines (31). However, the absence of a difference between children with positive or negative FHA could also stem from the relative small number of children included in the study. This small sample size also did not allow us the study the same children for 2 years both during and outside an URTI episode. Differences in cytokine production have been observed between children that do and do not develop allergic disease. Van der Velden et al. (11) showed that protein levels of Th2 cytokines (IL\u20104) produced by polyclonally stimulated blood lymphocytes increased from birth to 12 months of age in children with a high genetic risk for allergy who developed allergic disease at 2 years of age, whereas cytokine levels did not change in children who remained healthy. However, as none of our children had developed atopic dermatitis at the age of 2 years and a proper diagnosis of asthma and allergic rhinitis cannot be made in these young children, we were not able to verify these observations in our study. A follow\u2010up study on the development of allergic disease at the age of 6 years will help us address this question.",

This is partly supported by the present study as macrophage responses during URTI were more strongly related to the increasing number of respiratory tract infections than to the age of the child. However, our data on the development of nasal IL\u20104 and T\u2010lymphocyte responses show that these responses were more strongly related to the age of the child. At present, we are not able to distinguish between a strict age\u2010related or infection\u2010related immune maturation and it may well be that both factors are important for a correct maturation. We have necessarily restricted ourselves to viral infections in our study and not evaluated possible effects of bacterial infections or colon colonisation. Given our results, a larger study seems called for that encompasses these factors.",

Neither the incidence of respiratory infections nor the nasal macrophage and T lymphocyte response upon URTI differed, indicating that both groups of children are equally susceptible to respiratory infections. This is in agreement with studies showing that a parental history of allergic disease is a risk factor for lower respiratory tract infections, but not for URTI (32). The design of our study also allowed an analysis of potential differences on the effect of upper vs lower respiratory tract infections on immune maturation. This would be interesting, as we have previously shown a strong nasal IL\u201018 response in RSV\u2010induced lower respiratory tract infection in children, where such a response is absent during a RSV\u2010induced URTI (33).",
