In the RDV method, viral genome sequences are obtained without sub-cloning into plasmid vectors. Nucleic acid sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Dengue virus were successfully detected in culture supernatants from virus-infected cells by RDV ver1.0, which is our original method for detecting RNA viral genomes (Mizutani et al., 2007, Kihara et al., 2007). To increase sensitivity over RDV ver1.0, the sequence-independent amplification step was improved. By using the improved method, RDV ver2.0, avian paramyxovirus was detected in the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs (Sakai et al., 2007). A new adenovirus was successfully detected in the culture supernatant of primary kidney cells originating from a fruit bat using this RDV method (RDV-D) (Maeda et al., 2008). RDV methods have the potential to become standard methods for the detection of both known as well as newly emerging unknown viruses in humans and animals.",

Therefore, very large numbers of combinations of primer sets (44\n \u00d7 44\n = 65,536 sets) are theoretically necessary to detect all the viral genomes in a sequence-independent manner (Mizutani et al., 2007). To avoid this level of complexity, we conventionally used the primer sets fixed the 5\u2032 end of two nucleotides in the four variable nucleotide region to AG for the forward primer or GG for the reverse primer. However, we found that some viral species are difficult to detect using the limited combinations of primer sets. For example, the Yokose virus (YOKV) was isolated from a bat in Japan in 1971, and it was found to be an Entebbe bat virus, genus Flavivirus, in the family Flaviviridae. Although the full genome sequence has been published recently (AB114858), little is yet known about the characteristics of the virus (Tajima et al., 2005). We attempted to detect the YOKV sequence in the culture supernatant from virus-infected Vero cells using the procedure of RDV ver1.0 and ver2.0, but this failed. Therefore, in this study, we further improved the RDV method to detect more virus species, in particular by modifying the adaptor ligation step, to reduce the candidates of PCR primer sets for direct sequencing. This RDV ver3.0 was able to detect over 100 cDNA fragments of YOKV.",

The S1\u2013S16 forward primers and N1\u2013N16 reverse primers were used in the second cDNA amplification step for direct sequencing (Fig. 2B). Using the RDV ver3.0, we successfully identified West Nile virus and Dengue virus type 2, which were used in previous our study (Mizutani et al., 2007) (data not shown). The RDV ver3.0 method was performed using extracted RNA from the culture supernatant obtained from YOKV-infected Vero cells. The 256 PCR products were processed by agarose gel electrophoresis. A total of 141 fragments were sequenced by the direct sequencing method, but sequences of 10 fragments were not obtained. One hundred eighteen exhibited high degrees of homology with the nucleic acid sequence of YOKV. Twenty-two DNA fragments were identified as mammal ribosomal RNAs (data not shown). The locations of the PCR fragments found in the YOKV genome are shown in Fig. 3\n. From the complete nucleotide sequences of YOKV, there are 10 cDNA fragments over 150 bp with HaeIII- and Sau3AI-digested ends (Fig. 3 column A), which are expected to be detected using RDV ver3.0, and eight fragments were detected (Table 1\nand Fig. 3 column B). Nine were obtained as partial digested viral cDNA fragments by HaeIII or Sau3AI (Fig. 3 column C). In addition, we found two or three ligated viral cDNA fragments (Fig. 3 column D) and cDNA fragments not containing recognition sequences of restriction enzymes at the ends (Fig. 3 column E).

            "text": "After direct sequencing, we found that viral DNA fragments could be amplified by PCR with a primer set in which one of two variable nucleotides in forward or reverse primers are matched to the target fragment. We obtained amplicons containing two or three ligated DNA fragments and also obtained viral DNA fragments partially digested with HaeIII or Sau3AI (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3, many DNA fragments, covering a diverse range of viral nucleotide sequences, were detected. This suggests that the sequenced fragments detected by RDV ver3.0 can be used for the design of primers to determine complete viral nucleotide sequences for long PCR when unknown viruses are detected.",
