Results For this purpose, the FMDV VP1 gene (SPVP1) was optimized and synthesized based on the codon bias of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), and then incorporated in the plasmid pNZ8148. L. lactis NZ9000 containing the pNZ8148-SPVP1 recombinant plasmid was used as an oral delivery vehicle to induce anti-FMDV mucosal and systemic immune responses in mice. After confirmation that the SPVP1 protein was expressed successfully in the recombinant L. latic, the mice were orally challenged with NZ9000-pNZ8148, NZ9000-pNZ8148-SPVP1, phosphate-buffered saline as a mock infection group, or with inactivated vaccine as a positive group. Mice immunized with NZ9000-pNZ8148-SPVP1 produced high levels of mucosal secretory IgA (sIgA), antigenspecific serum IgG, IgA, and neutralizing antibodies, and developed stronger cell-mediated immune reactions and significant T spleen lymphocyte proliferation. Furthermore, the recombinant group generated much higher levels of IFN-c, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 than the other groups. Conclusions Potent immune responses were successfully elicited in mice with FMDV VP1 delivered through L. lactis.",

            "text": "Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) is generally regarded as safe with potent effects and conveys important immunostimulant properties to both human and animals, which makes it an interesting and effective mucosal vaccination strategy. The Nisin Controlled gene Expression (NICE) system of L. lactis, developed 25 years ago, is a potent and strictly regulated protein production system depending on the auto-regulation mechanism of the bactericin nisin. Currently, this gene expression system has been widely used to express exogenous proteins in Gram-positive bacteria (Mierau and Kleerebezem 2005) . Far beyond the original role in food preservation and production, L. lactis in combination with the easy-to-operate and tightly regulated NICE system has various applications, especially the expression of pathogenic antigens (Ags) for safe immunization through mucosal surfaces and production of cytokines pharmaceutical products for medical treatments. Parenteral vaccination can stimulate an effective immune response, but generally cannot effectively activate mucosal responses and fails to protect the host from pathogens invading via the mucosa. However, mucosal vaccines especially lactococci vaccines, are capable of inducing both potent mucosal immunity and systemic responses to protect against mucosal invasion. FMDV infection takes place mainly through mucosal membranes and, thus, can be blocked by mucosal immunity with vaccines designed to induce specific mucosal responses at mucosal membranes to disrupt the virion transmission (Ogra et al. 2001) . Therefore, in this study, a new recombinant L. lactis strain (NZ9000) was made to express the VP1 gene from a FMDV A strain with a signal peptide sequence (SPusp45) (Dieye et al. 2001) . The aims of this research were to investigate the immunological impact of the plasmid pNZ8148 encoding FMDV-SPVP1 capsid protein through oral vaccination in a mouse model.",

Then, 50 lL of FMDV, adjusted to 200 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 )/100 lL, were added to the plates containing serially diluted serum. The mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, and then 100 lL of BHK cells (10 6 cells/ mL) were plated to the wells followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 5 days under 5% CO 2 . Finally, the cytopathic effect (CPE) of each serum dilution was measured by microscopy. The supernatant was removed followed by addition of 50 lL of stationary liquid (10% formaldehyde). After incubation for 30 min, the plates were stained with 10% formaldehyde containing 0.05% methylene blue solution for 30 min. The neutralizing Ab titers were calculated in this study, based on the Reed and Muench method, as the log 10 of the reciprocal of the final serum dilution that neutralized 100 TCID 50 of virus in 50% of the wells.",

            "text": "Since the early 1990s, FMD has been the primary sanitary barrier to the profitability of livestock products. Although many types of vaccines have been designed and applied to prevent FMDV infection, there have been some disadvantages, such as insufficient stability and reversion to virulence. It is worth mentioning that many commercial inactivated vaccines are able to induce high levels of neutralizing Abs providing protection against homologous serotypes, but yet fail to prevent the virus from infecting the host via the mucosa. Meanwhile, vaccines designed on basis of mucosal immunity have been shown to successfully trigger mucosal immune responses to prevent viruses from establishing mucosal sites to continue replication and dissemination (Yigang and Yijing 2008) , and more importantly, they can also elicit systemic IgG Abs as well as Ag-specific mucosal sIgA Abs. Consequently, the use of mucosal vaccines could be a much more promising approach applied in a similar way as current licensed parenteral vaccines (Fujkuyama et al. 2012) . FMDV generally infects animals via mucosal surfaces, which offers an attractive option for mucosal immunization with specific vaccine Ags for protection against infection. Sufficient data are now available to support the use of mucosal immunization to induce both mucosal and systemic responses to protect animals against FMDV. A previous study indicated that intranasal delivery of cationic poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles loaded with different FMDV DNA vaccine formulations encoding IL-6-enhanced protective immunity prevented infection from aerosolized FMDV (Wang et al. 2011) . Another publication showed that intranasal delivery of Chi-PLGA-DNA nanoparticles with FMDV Ags also decreased disease severity and virus excretion as well as delayed the onset of clinical symptoms with high levels of systemic, mucosal and cell-mediated immunity (Pan et al. 2014 ). Many available approaches using L. lactis to deliver exogenous vaccines Ags have been shown to efficiently stimulate mucosal responses. Oral administration of lactococci expressing viral antigens in situ has a number of advantages, including safety, convenience, fewer proteases, and no endotoxin prompting adverse reactions (Bermudez-Humaran 2009; Bermudez-Humaran et al. 2011) . Besides, L. lactis has been used to deliver many recombinant Ags, which can provoke the host mucosal and systemic responses with better protection. Some food-grade live vaccines have been developed and found to convey protective effects to animals under laboratory conditions, thereby providing a new direction for oral vaccines (expression of severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus nucleocapsid protein, production, and targeting of the Brucella abortus Ag, while a mucosal vaccine made from live, recombinant L. lactis protected mice). However, although lactococci have many potential advantages as carriers of live vaccines, no study has yet to investigate oral immunization with L. lactis for prevention against FMDV. Over the last several decades, the VP1 coding sequence has been partially or completely applied in vaccine design for the large-scale preparation of recombinant proteins in different expression systems, including E. coli, yeasts, baculovirus, plants, and mammalian cells (Chai et al. 2013; Jung et al. 2013; Lentz et al. 2010; Li et al. 2008; Parida et al. 2006; Shi et al. 2006 ) and thus FMDV VP1 was chosen for mucosal vaccine design in this study. The VP1 protein is the primary Ag inducing neutralizing Ab responses and plays a vital role in the assembly of FMDV particles (Yin et al. 2014) . Here, the sequence of VP1 was optimized according to the pool and codon used by L. lactis, by decreasing the GC content from 55.29-35.18%, without altering the protein sequence and optimizing unfavorable GC peaks, which could improve translational performance (Jiang et al. 2014 ). The signal peptide SPusp45, located at the N terminus of the VP1 gene, is a secreted extracellular protein of L. Lactis, and is usually used to direct extracellular secretion of any protein of interest. In addition, the NICE system was applied to express the FMDV-SPVP1 protein and strain NZ9000 was chosen to carry the pNZ8148 plasmid. Expression of the VP1 sequence by pNZ8148 without the signal peptide SPusp45 failed, while the fusion protein was only successfully expressed by fusing SPusp45 downstream of the VP1 sequence. Due to this signal peptide, both intracellular and extracellular expression of VP1 can be detected with immunoreactive bands.",

Likewise, mucosal vaccines can induce sIgA and IgA Abs in the adaptive immune defense of mucosa. The results of the present study also showed that high levels of specific IgA and sIgA were observed in serum, lungs, and intestinal tract, indicating the important roles of IgA and sIgA responses in preventing FMDV. Although, IgG Ab emerges later that IgA and sIgA, the levels were much higher and lasted longer. These data suggested that mucosal responses induced by recombinant L. lactis were interactive with systemic responses. Although the inactivated vaccine group had the highest serum levels of IgG Ab, there was a very slight or no increase of IgA and sIgA in the mucosal samples, as high IgG concentrations occurred on day 20 after the first vaccination.",

The results obviously showed that oral administration of SPVP1 proteins is able to trigger both mucosal and systemic responses. Although this mucosal VP1 protein-based vaccine contributed to a detectable FMDV-specific IgG and IgA responses, as a result of VP1 gene frequent mutations, it was not possible to produce a both stable and effective immune response of the host. At present, many groups are exploring alternative genes containing effective immuno-dominant epitopes with fewer mutations. For instance, VP2 is thought to carry immuno-dominant epitopes and has essential immunological characteristics for the design of FMDV vaccines (Xue et al. 2012) . Ongoing studies by our group are also exploring the immune effects of other FMDV gene segments, such as P12A3C in combination IFN-c expressed by lactic acid bacteria via mucosal routes in mice, guinea pigs, and swine. However, those studies are still in preliminary stages, thus further data are needed from different animal models, especially large animals, and different immunization routes are required to compare and optimize immunization programs, such as comparisons with the intranasal and oral immunizations, the co-expression of larger fragments and cytokines, the optimal dose of therapeutic protein delivered in situ, and the best period of life for vaccination.",
