Ferrets are often presented with a nonspecific history of chronic diarrhea and cachexia, which usually corresponds to a significant diagnostic challenge (\nTable 1).",

Unfortunately, and for obvious reasons, full-thickness biopsies cannot be harvested through a gastroscopy procedure. For certain GI disease conditions a full-thickness tissue sample is required for a definitive diagnosis. When lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates are identified in the GI tract of ferrets, the etiologic agent is rarely identified.1 In a review of 9 ferret cases in which lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates were identified, spiral-shaped bacteria consistent with Helicobacter sp. was diagnosed in 1 animal whereas the other cases were characterized with moderate to severe lymphoplasmacytic gastritis and duodenitis. One case was described as having an eosinophilic infiltrate of the gastric mucosa.",

Protein digestibility in ferrets is limited compared with cats.6, 7 Therefore, ferrets require food items that contain highly digestible animal protein (35% to 55% of dry matter; e.g., whole prey rat contains 55% protein).7 Recommended medical management for eosinophilic gastroenteritis cases includes immunosuppressive therapy using prednisone (2 mg/kg, once a day), cyclosporine (4 mg/kg, twice a day), or azathioprine (0.9 mg/kg, once every 2 days).1, 5, 8\n",

Immunohistochemistry is an invaluable tool to identify rare GI tumors and help one establish a more accurate prognosis for the patient.14 In a survey of 20 ferrets diagnosed with lymphoma, 45% were of GI origin.10 Digestive tract lymphomas are typically of T-cell origin and predominantly high-grade immunoblastic neoplasias involving the mesenteric lymph node.10 In another study evaluating 29 ferrets affected by lymphoma, the median survival time for a T-cell lymphoma was 5 months (range 0.5 to 14) compared with 8.4 months (range 2.0 to 19.0) for B-cell lymphoma.11 Chemotherapy has been proposed as a treatment option but further studies are needed to assess the therapeutic efficacy and adverse side effects, as well as quality of life during the treatment period.11\n",

Less common signs associated with FRSCV include hindlimb paresis, seizures, respiratory signs, bruxism, icterus, erythema of the skin, colored urine, and rectal prolapse. Ultrasonography may be beneficial when trying to diagnose FRSCV.23 Serology to detect antibodies to ferret coronavirus, immunohistochemistry staining, PCR, and specific reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) have all been described as diagnostic tests to detect FRSCV in ferrets, but all have serious flaws in the ability to detect this disease.24, 25, 26, 27 Necropsy findings from ferrets that die from FRSCV include polyadenomegaly and white nodules on the serosal surface, grossly resembling the dry form of FIP in cats. Histologically, pyogranulomatous infiltrates are commonly observed in the lymph nodes and the nodules of FRSCV infected ferrets (\nFig. 4A and B).",

Two studies reported l-Lactate mean values in normal rabbits from 7.3 (\u00b12.9) mmol/L (65.7 mg/dL \u00b1 26.1 mg/dL) to 5.1 (\u00b12.1) mmol/L (45.9 mg/dL \u00b1 18.9 mg/dL), which are higher than physiologic values in carnivores (2.4 mmol/L; 21.6 mg/dL).46, 47 However, it remains unclear whether high lactate values have any clinical significance in obstructed rabbits and further studies are necessary to verify this hypothesis.",

            "text": "A novel astrovirus was described in rabbits after screening animals with enteritis complex.60 Astroviruses were first discovered in 1975 using electron microscopy to investigate an unusual cluster of human diarrhea cases.61 Astroviruses are small icosahedral virus with a diameter of 28 to 35 nm. They have a characteristic 5- or 6-pointed star-like surface structure when viewed by electron microscopy. The astrovirus has an RNA genome within a nonenveloped icosahedral capsid and has been isolated from lambs,62 calves,63 red deer,64 cats,65 mice,66 mink,67 bats,68 turkeys,69 and chickens.70 The epidemiology of astrovirus infection in rabbits is still unknown, but in human medicine, it has been determined that the immunocompromised are most susceptible to the disease.61 This virus has been isolated in rabbits presenting with enterocolitis or enteritis complex. Clinical signs in rabbits from which astrovirus has been isolated are diarrhea, dehydration, abdominal distension, and hyperthermia. Astrovirus has also been isolated from animals without diarrhea, which suggest a subclinical disease state. Currently it is unknown if this virus can act as primary agent of enteritis in rabbits. Histopathologically, macroscopic lesions of astrovirus infected tissue are noted by the presence of hemorrhagic foci within the tissue of the small intestine. Microscopically the villi are shortened and thickened, with dilatation of the intestinal lamina propria and capillaries. In mice and mink, the recommended control and preventive measures are based on environmental disinfection (i.e., cleaning the environment, separation of the affected from noninfected animals).63, 66 Antibiotic therapy for both infected and exposed animals may reduce the occurrence of concurrent secondary bacterial infections, thereby improving the patient\u2019s prognosis.",

Ten species of intestinal coccidia, all members of the genus Eimeria, are reported to infect domestic rabbits.71 The Eimeria species described in this article are considered species specific for the rabbit, and exposure is through fecal-oral transmission. Adult carriers often serve as a source of infection for newborn rabbits. Rabbits at 2 to 3 months of age appear to be most susceptible to the pathogenicity of intestinal coccidiosis.72, 73 The number of young animals affected in rabbit colonies can vary, with some cases reaching 100%.71 The most important species of intestinal coccidia as it relates to overall rabbit health are Eimeria perforans, Eimeria magna, and Eimeria media, with E. perforans being the most common and the least pathogenic species for laboratory rabbits.71, 74 In 1 pet rabbit research study, E. magna was identified as the dominant coccidia species (60%), along with E. media (30%) and Eimeria intestinalis (10%).75\nE. intestinalis is generally considered the most pathogenic, E. magna moderately pathogenic with important subclinical effects, and E. media relatively nonpathogenic to rabbits.75\n",
