In 1985 a calicivirus was isolated from the feces of a 4-year-old dog with bloody diarrhea and central nervous system disturbance in Tennessee, USA. The virus was found to replicate in experimentally infected dogs and to elicit seroconversion, although disease was not reproduced. Also, the virus was antigenically unrelated to FCV and antibodies against the virus were identified in 76% of the canine sera collected.31 However, it was not characterized molecularly and its taxonomic status remains uncertain. In 1990, another calicivirus was identified in Japan in a 2-month-old pup with intermittent watery diarrhea.32 The virus, strain 48, was found to be antigenically and genetically unrelated to FCV and was tentatively proposed as a \u201ctrue\u201d canine calicivirus (CaCV) and included in the Vesivirus genus.33, 34 Antibodies to CaCV 48 have been detected in 57% of dogs in Japan35 and in 36.5% of dogs in Korea.36\n",

That mixed infections can elicit mechanisms of synergism, as observed between coronaviruses and parvoviruses,48, 49 cannot be ruled out. Interestingly, the frequency of detection of NoV has been found to differ significantly between symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs in a 1-year survey in Portugal.44 Interpretation of these findings is not clear, as several factors can influence the course of NoV infection. As canine NoVs appear to display a number of capsid genotypes, there could be differences in the biological properties (eg, virulence, ability to bind to canine cellular receptors, and so on) among the various NoV strains. In addition, mechanisms of genetic resistance could alter the outcome of NoV infection in some canine breeds, thus confounding the picture. Experimental human infection studies with the prototype Norwalk virus (GI.1) showed that the study participants were repeatedly susceptible or resistant to symptomatic infection following repeated virus challenge.50 Subsequent studies have revealed that human NoVs recognize histoblood group antigens (HBGAs) as receptors or co-receptors. HGBAs are complex carbohydrates present on the surface of red blood cells and mucosal epithelia, or free in biological fluids such as milk and saliva. HGBAs are synthesized under the control of highly polymorphic ABO, Lewis, and secretor gene families. Different NoV genotypes variously recognize these antigens, and the recognition patterns have been found to correlate with susceptibility to infection and illness.51, 52, 53, 54 The global spread and predominance of pandemic GII.4 NoV variants have been related to the broad range of recognized HBGA types.51 Similar mechanisms appear to influence genetic resistance of pigs to NoV infection under experimental conditions.55\n",

            "text": "Dogs are regarded as vectors of viral, bacterial, or parasitic zoonosis,63 but the risks linked to transmission of enteric viruses are almost ignored. However, several pieces of evidences indicate that enteric viruses may have a zoonotic potential: (1) infection of young children by rotavirus strains of canine and feline origin has been documented repeatedly64; (2) having dogs in or near a home has been recognized as a risk factor for acquisition of IgA antibodies specific for NoV in infants in a seroepidemiologic study conducted in rural Mexico65; and (3) a calicivirus gastroenteritis outbreak occurred in a nursing home in Exeter, UK, in 1983 and was found to be epidemiologically linked to the household dog. Acute gastroenteric disease in the dog occurred 24 hours before the human index case and antibodies specific for the human caliciviruses were identified in the dog, thus suggesting a possible association.66 (4) Also, under experimental conditions, NoVs have been found to be able to cross the host species barriers. A GII.4 human NoV was able to infect and induce diarrhea in gnotobiotic piglets and calves,11, 10 thus indicating that heterologous infections can occur. (5) In addition, NoV strains genetically similar to the canine virus Bari/91/07/ITA (88.9% nucleotides and 98.9% amino acid identities in a short fragment spanning the 5\u2032 end of ORF2) have been detected in oysters destined for raw consumption in Japan (strains Yamaguchi/C34/03/JAP, Yamaguchi/24B/02/JAP, and Yamaguchi/24C/02/JAP67). This could indicate that canine-like GVI NoVs are common in some geographic settings and that they can contaminate the coastal areas and accumulate at detectable levels in bivalve molluscs destined for raw consumption. Contamination of shellfish by animal (porcine and bovine) enteric caliciviruses, alone or in conjunction with human viruses, has been demonstrated in 22% of oysters in United States.68 However, while the impact of sewage pollution on the water environment by livestock may be relevant, especially in the areas of high livestock production, it is difficult to explain the presence of canine-like NoVs in oysters. A possible explanation for this is that similar viruses are harbored in other animal species or in settled human populations. (6) Finally, human GIV (Alphatron-like) NoVs are genetically much more related to animal GIV NoVs (GIV.2) than to GI and GII human NoVs, suggesting points of intersection during their evolution. The modalities of this intersection are uncertain but likely they were favored by the strict social interactions between humans and pets.",
