Four different approaches can be used for cytokine removal: direct haemoperfusion using a neutro-macroporous sorbent; plasma adsorption on a resin after plasma separation from whole blood; CKRT with hollow fibre filters with adsorptive properties; and high-dose CKRT with medium cut-off (MCO) or high cut-off (HCO) membranes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 107, "end": 108, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 192, "end": 193, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cytokine damage"}, {"text": "Cytokine removal is mainly carried out using a neutro-macroporous sorbent.

In another Chinese cohort 5 of 41 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, the prevalence of ARDS was 27% and that of AKI was 7%. IL-6 concentration was similar between patients who were admitted to the ICU (39%) and those who did not receive ICU care, whereas the plasma concentration of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was higher in patients who were admitted to the ICU. An excessively high concentration of anti-inflammatory mediators might be harmful as it could predispose the patient to a state of relative immunosuppression.

For example, CRS cardiomyopathy and acute viral myocarditis can both contribute to renal vein congestion, hypotension and renal hypoperfusion, leading to a reduction in glomerular filtration rate. ECMO provides support to both the heart and the lungs and can be used in conjunction with CKRT. It is advisable to connect the CKRT circuit directly to the ECMO apparatus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Organ crosstalk"}, {"text": "Fluid expansion may lead to positive fluid balance in patients with shock. Such expansion has a detrimental effect in ARDS, as it increases alveolar-capillary leakage, and in AKI, as it worsens renal vein congestion, leading to renal compartment syndrome. We speculate that a similar clinical picture occurs in patients with COVID-19; however, fluid balance status was not reported in the recent publications. Rhabdomyolysis, metabolic acidosis and hyperkalaemia can also occur in patients with COVID-19 and are almost always associated with haemodynamic instability. Our team encourages the use of CKRT in these patients, preferentially with MCO or ECMO provides support to both the heart and the lungs and can be used in conjunction with CKRT C o m m e n t HCO membranes. Of note, compared with HCO membranes, MCO membranes have higher pore density and more uniformity in pore size distribution in the range that enables effective and selective removal of middle molecules such as myoglobin (17 kDa), IL-6 (21 kDa) and IL-10 (18 kDa). Importantly, intrinsic characteristics such as tridimensional configuration, hydrophilicity, protein binding and electrical charge are equally as important as pore size in determining the clearance of solutes while minimizing albumin loss. Superimposed infections can occur in patients during a long ICU stay. When metabolized by enzymes in the blood, lipopolysaccharide expressed in the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria becomes endotoxin, which can cause septic shock. In the Chinese cohort of 1,099 patients mentioned above, septic shock was present in 11 of 173 (6.4%) patients with severe COVID-19 (ReF. 2 ). We assume that septic AKI may occur in such patients and act synergistically with other mechanisms of kidney damage. In patients with suspected or confirmed Gram-negative bacterial infections and an endotoxin activity assay result of 0.6-0.9, the use of haemoperfusion with a cartridge containing polystyrene fibres functionalized with polymyxin-B provides effective endotoxin adsorption 10 . The functionalized surface has sites that bind to the endotoxin, reducing its plasma concentration. Haemoperfusion should be used for 2 hours a day for 2 subsequent days. The recommendation for use of anticoagulation during cytokine adsorption also applies to endotoxin adsorption and we suggest a blood flow of around 100-120 ml/min. CKRT filters with acrylonitrile and sodium methallyl sulfonate plus polyethyleneimine also have adsorptive capacity for endotoxins. Daily changes of all CKRT filters are recommended irrespective of their composition.
