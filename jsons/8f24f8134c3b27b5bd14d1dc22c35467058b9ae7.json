While there are clear cases of elective surgery (benign cranial cosmetic defect) and emergency surgery (hemorrhage, fracture, trauma, etc.), there is an unchartered middle ground in pediatric neurosurgery. Children, unlike adults, have dynamic anatomy and are still developing neural networks. Delaying seemingly elective surgery can affect a child's already vulnerable health state by further impacting their neurocognitive development, neurologic functioning, and potential long-term health states. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that \"elective\" pediatric neurosurgery should be risk-stratified, and multi-institutional informed guidelines established.",

While there has been some centralized effort in adult surgery to standardize and stratify low vs. high acuity [1] , this has not yet occurred for pediatric neurosurgery. Given these new restrictions, many fields of medicine have made some general recommendations including head and neck surgery [2] , anesthesia [3] , cardiac electrophysiology [4] , and colorectal surgery [5] . While some recommendations apply to neurosurgery, particularly endoscopic sinonasal and skull base recommendations [2] , no manuscripts exist to systematically stratify risk associated with delay in common pediatric neurosurgical procedures.",

Urgent cases that present an immediate threat to the patient's life or neurologic well-being (e.g., shunt malfunction, acute hematoma evacuation, tumor with hydrocephalus, empyema, spinal cord compression) are straightforward and undergo prompt surgical intervention. Elective surgery is readily defined as cases that offer a negligible or minimal threat of harm to the patient if surgery is delayed for several months. Examples might include skull dermoids/epidermoids, prophylactic spinal lipoma untethering operations, and some craniofacial procedures. These are similarly less challenging in the current environment. However, there are a large number of procedures which are less straightforward in which lack of prompt surgery, while not emergent, may result in neurologic harm to the patient. Delaying all \"elective\" surgeries in this population poses health-related risks, and a review of best available evidence on harm imposed by delaying these operations is warranted.",

            "text": "Supporting evidence Low-grade neoplasms characteristically show slow, linear growth with a minimal risk of rapid decline from mass effect [6] . For pilocytic astrocytomas, the greatest risk is likely the development of a cystic component that may show focal accelerated growth [7] . Other lesions such as craniopharyngiomas show highly variable growth patterns and often have a cystic component that may expand more rapidly to cause mass effect or obstruction [8] . Another important consideration in predicting potential risk for focal mass effect is the degree of surrounding edema elicited by the tumor. This risk also correlates with tumor histology [9] . Low-grade tumors such as pilocytic astrocytomas, glioneuronal tumors (DNT, ganglioglioma, etc.) and grade I gliomas typically offer a low risk for acutely developing edema [10] . High-grade pediatric lesions such as PNTs, embryonal tumors, choroid plexus carcinomas, or high-grade gliomas (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme) harbor substantially greater risk for edema and secondary rapid increase in mass effect [10] . Similarly, the incidence of hemorrhage into a tumor recurrence is predominantly determined by histologic diagnosis [11] . The pediatric brain tumors with the highest risk for hemorrhage include high-grade embryonal neoplasms of infancy [12] , glioblastoma [13] , and mixed malignant germ cell tumors [14] . As such, the prior histology of a recurrent lesion is the principle determinant of the acute risk for a sudden decline from hemorrhage or sudden edema. For example, Donofrio et al. [15] noted thin-walled, small, and closely packed vascularization in pediatric patients with cerebellar hemorrhage from pilocytic astrocytomas 10]. White et al. [16] characterized three distinct histological subtypes which correlated with hemorrhagic events in pilocytic astrocytomas [16] . Specifically, thick-walled hyalinized vessels with glomeruloid structures of vascular endothelial hyperplasia with ectatic vessels serve as a nidus for bleeds [16] . Multiple studies in the literature outline the relationship between histologic features and intratumor hemorrhage [15, [17] [18] [19] [20] . Pagano et al. [21] describe recurrent hemorrhage of pilocytic astrocytomas and stressed the importance of VEGF for aberrant neov a s c u l a r i z a t i o n a n d h y p e r p e r m e a b i l i t y [ 2 1 ] . Immunohistochemistry is now being better understood through genetic markers. As described by Phoenix et al. [41] , medulloblastoma genotype highly dictates the vascular environment and hemorrhagic tendencies of tumors [22] . Most recently, Ishi et al. demonstrated the association of FGFR1 mutation with hemorrhagic events in low-grade pediatric gliomas [23] .",

When patients are asymptomatic, the clinical course is benign overall [25, 26] . However, neurologic deficits arising secondary to syringomyelia may not be reversible with surgery. A recent practice preference survey by Rocque et al. [27] of the membership of the American Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery (ASPN) demonstrated a strong preference for using presence of a syrinx regardless of symptoms in the setting of Chiari I malformation as a threshold for surgery [27] . Most surgical series have reported a 60-85% incidence of syrinx with CIM but larger radiographic series show that only 10-15% of patients with a C1M have a syrinx [28, 29] . This suggests that patients with syrinxes are selected in surgical series.",

Wetjen and Oldfield [37] studied 29 patients who underwent posterior fossa decompression for C1M and found a median time of 3.6 months (95%CI = 3.0-6.5 months) [37] . Experienced Chiari surgeons typically advocate MRI imaging follow-up in 6-12 months. (3) Surgical decompression has a consistently good but variable impact on syrinx. Tubbs et al. [29] found that only 4 out of 285 patients with syrinx demonstrated progression after posterior fossa decompression and cranioplasty [29] . Zhang and colleagues [38] demonstrated that 60% of patients who underwent posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty showed a reduction in size. Less is written or available on the time course of syrinx change and the common time point for observations is 6 months. A large meta-analysis by Durham and Fjeld-Olenec [39] that compared techniques of C1M decompression (decompression alone vs. decompression with duraplasty) demonstrated 56-87% syrinx resolution with operative decompression [39] . However, small numbers of syrinxes associated with Chiari I decrease in size over time without operative intervention and some syrinxes do not change after posterior fossa. (4) Recovery of neurologic symptoms from a Chiari related syrinx is typically incomplete and permanent. The presence of a syrinx then represents a non-predictable risk factor for irreversible neurologic dysfunction from intrinsic chronic stress and injury to the spinal cord. Sudden decline is very rare but can occur especially from minor injury [28, [31] [32] [33] [34] .",

Approximately one-third of patients with epilepsy will demonstrate MRE. These patients are candidates for surgical intervention and the overwhelming majority can be evaluated and operated upon electively. However, an increased percentage of children have catastrophic epilepsy which is characterized by highly resistant and threatening generalized seizures. These often culminate in repeated episodes of status epilepticus and raise the risk for sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Children with congenital or acquired s t r u c t u r a l a n o m a l i e s o f t h e b r a i n s u c h a s hemimegalencephaly, holohemispheric dysplasias, hemispheric atrophy, and cystic encephalomalacia (often due to perinatal infarcts/ischemia) are more frequently found to have catastrophic epilepsy than those patients with more normal MRI findings. Syndromic epilepsies such as Lennox-Gastaut and Rasmussen's encephalitis are highly resistant and associated with progressively severe and difficult to control disease. Similarly recurring episodes of status epilepticus, Epilepsia partialis continua, or electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) threaten the child's safety and neurologic development. Children with malignant, threatening patterns such as these warrant an assertive, proactive approach to control and localization of their seizures. When accompanied by a structural change, these epilepsies are typically focal in onset and are amenable to surgical resection. Due to the acute risk and lack of other effective strategies, surgery for these cases is often considered urgent and is justifiable and appropriate to proceed to surgery in an environment in which elective cases are suspended.",

Additionally, binary logistic regression demonstrated that younger children (less than 3 years of age) were 2.76 times more likely to achieve a seizure-free outcome compared with older children (4 to 17 years of age) [40] . Furthermore, developmental outcome as assessed by Loddenkemper et al.

Finally, Pelliccia et al.

Another study using the KID database showed delayed repair of craniosynostosis to be associated with longer length of stay (LOS) and increased cost [48] . In a sample of 3246 patients with an average age of 181 days, LOS directly impact mean charge and total cost [48] .

In the syndromic cases, the characteristic brachycephaly requires bi-frontal orbital advancement or distraction. The skull characteristically can be molded and reossification occurs readily until about the age of 2 years. After this, the bone is thicker, more brittle, and does not contour as readily. Consequently, there is likely limited harm in delaying syndromic cases inside of 2 years of age.

Symptoms usually consist of pain in the back, buttocks, and legs and variable but progressive loss of neurologic function in the legs and bladder [49] . Prevailing wisdom in pediatric neurosurgery is that once function is lost, it is typically not regained.

Intervention for asymptomatic tethered cord is largely prophylactic and is variably controversial depending on the underlying tethering lesion. For example, split cord malformations have a high incidence of inducing progressive neurologic decline unless repaired whereas the natural history of a low-lying spinal conus medullaris is less well established and there is significant controversy surrounding prophylactic untethering.",

[51] describe a similar relationship in a cohort of 97 pediatric patients. Fifty-six patients presented before the age of 6 months, and 35 of these patients were neurologically intact [51] . However, of the 41 patients presenting after the age of 6 months, only 12 patients were neurologically intact [51] . Surgery should be performed prior to the onset of neurologic deficits. As demonstrated by Kanev et al. [52] in a cohort of 42 patients presenting with neurologic deficit, 0/42 (0%) of patients regained bladder or bowel function post-operatively [52] . A logarithmic model developed by Kanev et al. using data from two series [51, 52] demonstrates that all patients would develop neurological deficits over time by 12 years of age [53] . While these studies do not provide definitive evidence of a danger with delay, they do suggest that prevention of deficit or worsening of deficits might be more successful with earlier surgery.",

The need for social distancing and preservation, or limited availability, of personal protective equipment has resulted in widespread curtailment of elective operative procedures. During this time, it is essential to establish an informed hierarchy of need for pediatric neurosurgical cases. Many pediatric neurosurgery cases are urgent and must proceed. Examples include shunt obstructions, infections, post-traumatic hematomas, and myelomeningocele closures. Other cases are clearly elective and results are not likely impacted by limited delays. However, there exist a significant number of pediatric neurosurgical cases for which the impact of time delay in intervention is unknown. Some cases appear elective but review of published experience demonstrates that poorer outcomes or higher risk accompanies delay. An informed hierarchy of need incorporates the potential increase into adverse outcomes associated with delay as well as the imminent threat to the patient in the short term. The cases selected for this report are not comprehensive but are representative of a substantial component of elective pediatric neurosurgical practice. Within these cases, there are multiple examples of how a delay in performing surgery during an optimal eligibility window is associated with more adverse effects over the life span.",

However, an effort that exhaustive is outside the scope of this manuscript's purpose of creating awareness on delay of common pediatric neurosurgical procedures. For the sake of completeness, some basic recommendations can be made regarding the procedures listed. For example, craniosynostosis repair should not exceed 4 months to prevent open surgery. Total obstetrical brachial plexus repair should be performed by 3 months of age to prevent neurologic deficit. Additionally, asymptomatic tethered cord and Chiari I malformation with syrinx should not be postponed longer than 6 months as the purpose of surgery is symptom prophylaxis. Lesional epilepsy represents a more complex disease process and a case-by-case evaluation is necessary depending on seizure burden, medication use, and concurrent tumor. As the referenced literature demonstrates, there are clear transition points in childhood (1 year of age and 3 years of age) that represent important checkpoints for intervention.",
