As an alternative to parenteral application, the patient-friendly delivery of active peptides by mucosal routes of entry is of major interest. Peroral dosing, the most common route of application for the systemic delivery of drugs, is limited for most peptides due to extensive metabolism and poor mucosal permeability [20]. Nasal drug delivery has been proposed as the most feasible alternative to parenteral injections due to the high permeability of the nasal epithelium, the avoidance of first-pass metabolism and a convenient administration route. A number of peptide and protein drugs restricted to oral administrations have been intensively investigated for systemic medication through nasal administrations [39]. However, nasal TP 5 delivery, as a potentially useful administration route, has not been reported according to our knowledge.",

Nasal delivery TP 5 may encounter the same situation although the molecular weight of TP 5 (M\nw\n = 679.8) is relatively low. Among the approaches explored so far in order to optimize the transport of the peptide molecules across mucosal barriers, the use of penetration enhancers or mucosal enzyme inhibitor represents a challenging but promising strategy. Therefore, the several TP 5 preparations for intranasal administrations were formulated by incorporating the five absorption enhancers, including sodium deoxycholate (SDch), sodium carprylate (SCa), polyoxyethylene lauryl ether (Brij 35), chitosan and bacitracin, respectively. Furthermore, TP 5 solution was administered intravenously and intranasally for evaluation of the effect of nasal delivery.",

The test principle is as follows: superoxide anions (O2\n\u2212) are generated by a xanthine oxidase (XOD) system and oxidize hydroxylamine forming the product of nitrite. This product is stained with the kit reagent, thereby showing purple color. Absorbance of the stained solution is assayed at 550 nm using a spectrophotometer (752-type, Shanghai, China). When SOD is present in the sample, superoxide anion concentration is lowered through specific inhibition, thus lowering the colorimetric signal. Consequently, SOD activity is obtained after calculation. For each assay, a volume of 15 \u03bcl plasma sample was used. All the processing and assay validation met the requirements of the kit instruction. One unit of SOD activity is defined as that amount of enzyme required to inhibit the reduction of SOD by 50% under the specified conditions.",

The degradation products, both TP4 and TP3, are shown to exert similar immunomodulatory activities to TP5 affecting both humoral and cellular responses [13], [27].

Our pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that three penetration enhancers including sodium deoxycholate (SDch), polyoxyethylene lauryl ether (Brij 35), and chitosan significantly improve the absorption extent of FITC-TP 5 via nasal mucosa. Sodium deoxycholate was thought as a potential absorption enhancer for drug delivery [21], and the enhanced absorption of FITC-TP 5 by sodium deoxycholate may be caused by the interaction mechanism that bile sodium was reported to able to disrupt lipid bilayers by intercalating between the phospholipids and forming mixed micelles [40], [41]. The nasal promoting effect of Brij 35 may be related to the changed mucosal permeability [15]. Chitosan is a cationic polysaccharide widely employed as an absorption enhancer [19], [12]. The ability of chitosan to work as an absorption enhancer was proven on Caco-2 cells, which serve as a model of intestinal epithelium [4], [8], [14], [31], as well as in \u2018in vitro\u2019 experiments on nasal and buccal mucosae of animals [25], [30]. The enhanced drug absorption by chitosan may be derived from the effect of calcium on adherent junctions rather than direct effect on tight junctions [19] while calcium ions are essential for the cells to maintain intercellular contacts. The removal of extracellular calcium in cultured epithelial cell lines or in vivo mucosae may result in the opening of tight junctions and prevent the formation of new tight junctions. This mechanism may be also true for the FITC-TP 5.",

Previous studies demonstrated that the absorption promoting effect of sodium caprylate on insulin was in part associated with the chelating ability for calcium ions and the inhibitory action on leucine aminopeptidase activity [24]. In the present study, the immunomodulating activity of FITC labeled TP 5 was remained as the same as that of TP 5 (data from Chinese Peptide Company). Therefore, the increased absorption of FITC-TP 5 by sodium caprylate may be associated with the similar mechanism. Bacitracin is a protease inhibitor, which was proven to be more compatible with nasal cilia [28]. Incorporating bacitracin into a nasal formulation may be beneficial for the absorption of FITC-TP 5 due to the inhibition of TP 5 degradation by the proteases. The present results indicate that the absorption of FITC-TP 5 is slight increased as compared with the blank control (in absence of any enhancer) although it does not reach such an extent as expected. Among the five enhancers, Brij 35 seems to be the most significant factor for enhancing the absorption.",

The lymphatic drainage from the local nasal mucosa and NALT drains into the cervical lymph nodes and then to the systemic lymphatic system. Furthermore, peptides administered intranasally rapidly reach the brain through multiple pathways, consisting of olfactory neuronal, extraneuronal olfactory epithelial, trigeminal nerve and neuronal pathways [22], [35]. Previous investigation showed that the intranasal administration of interferon (IFN) beta-1b led to a significant delivery throughout the rat central nervous system (CNS) and cervical lymph nodes, but a relatively low delivery to peripheral organs [29]. Therefore, intranasally administered peptides such as thymopentin are very likely to end up in the central nervous system. This can be good or bad. For treating multiple sclerosis (MS), intranasal administration of IFN beta-1b may offer a non-invasive approach and produces beneficial effects of tyrosine phosphorylation of IFN receptor in the CNS. For exerting immunomodulating effect, however, TP 5 targeted to the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue may be more beneficial because the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), a mucosal inductive site for the upper respiratory tract, is important for the development of mucosal immunity. In the present study, the measured FITC-TP 5 after administration via nasal cavity is most likely absorbed through the pathway of the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). However, it is unclear that how much amount of TP 5 was delivered to the brain and what will happen after the TP 5 reaching the CNS. Thus these issues deserve further investigations.",

Sodium deoxycholate and Brij 35 cause apparently injury to nasal mucosal cilia, indicating these two enhancers would not be suitable for nasal delivery. The pharmacodynamic investigations suggest that all the TP 5 formulations with or without an enhancer improve the immnuomudulating efficacy in the immunosuppression rats. On an overall evaluation, intranasal TP 5 alone, TP 5 with chitosan, or TP 5 with bacitracin formulation may be suitable for the future clinical application.",
