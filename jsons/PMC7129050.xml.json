Viral infection can induce expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in cells and in animals. NO inhibits the replication of a variety of viruses (9, 30, 7, 8, 26, 1, 33, 65). We and others have previously shown that NO inhibits the replication of Coxsackievirus and other Picornaviruses (33, 42, 50, 15, 21, 68, 69). Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection induces iNOS expression in macrophages in mice, and CVB3 replicates more rapidly to higher titers and causes more tissue damage in mice lacking iNOS, compared to infections of wild-type mice. Exogenous NO inhibits replication of Coxsackievirus and poliovirus in vitro, reducing viral RNA and protein synthesis. Thus, iNOS and NO are important components of the immune response to CVB3 infection. However, the viral targets of NO are unknown.",

NO inhibits proteolysis of the viral protein precursor 2ABC, delaying and reducing the amount of the cleavage products 2BC and 2C detected by immunoblotting (Figure 2A).

First, HeLa cells were infected with CVB3, and then cell culture inserts were added that contained RAW 264.7 macrophages, activated or not with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-\u03b3. The macrophages were separated from the infected HeLa cells by a 0.4 \u03bcM pore size membrane, which would allow the passage of NO from macrophages to infected cells. The NOS inhibitor nitro-arginine-methyl-ester (NAME) was added to some cocultures of infected HeLa cells and activated macrophages, in order to confirm that any antiviral effect of activated macrophages was a result of NO, and not some other mechanism. Cells were harvested 5 hr after infection, and the cleavage of the viral polyprotein 2ABC was measured by immunoblotting as above.",

Infected HeLa cells alone (lane 2) contain three prominent polypeptides recognized by the antibody to 2C (as well as another band also found in noninfected cells [lane 1]). These three polypeptides are 2ABC and its two proteolytic products 2BC and 2C. Resting macrophages (lane 3) do not affect the intensity of the three viral polypeptides. However, macrophages activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) (lane 4) release a soluble mediator that diffuses across the 4 \u03bcM pores and inhibits the processing of 2ABC into 2BC and 2C. This soluble mediator may be NO, since increasing concentrations of the NOS inhibitor NAME are associated with decreasing amounts of NO and also with increasing proteolytic processing of the viral polypeptide (lanes 5\u20137). (LPS or IFN alone have no effect upon viral replication in HeLa cells [Figure 2C].) Thus, NO synthesized by activated macrophages can diffuse into infected cells and inhibit the viral proteases that process the viral polyproteins.",

The protease 2Apro cleaves the viral polyprotein at the boundary between the structural proteins and the nonstructural proteins, VP1 and 2A, producing two polyproteins. The protease 3Cpro is thought to cleave the resulting polyproteins into ten viral polypeptides, including the cleavage of 2BC into 2B and 2C (27, 22, 51). The protease 3Cpro is a critical component of the Picornavirus life cycle: mutation of any of the three amino acids in the active site of 3Cpro inactivates the protease and abolishes viral replication (27, 22, 51). One of the residues of the catalytic site of 3Cpro is cysteine at amino acid position 147, and since NO can nitrosylate cysteine residues (61, 62, 60), we hypothesized that NO inhibits the CVB3 3Cpro.",

The effect of NO upon protease activity was determined by adding NO donors and luciferase to either wild-type or mutant protease. NO reduces wild-type 3Cpro activity, and DTT restores wild-type protease activity (Figure 6). However, NO has no effect upon mutant C147S3Cpro activity, nor does DTT change mutant protease activity.

This protease is critical to the life cycle of Picornaviruses. Nitrosylation of cysteine residues is one mechanism by which NO can directly modify a polypeptide, and NO in theory can reduce the activity of an enzyme if its catalytic site includes a cysteine residue (62, 63, 60). For example, NO inhibits activity of the cysteine protease caspase-3 (31, 40, 47, 52). Although proteins capable of being nitrosylated at a cysteine residue contain a consensus nitrosylation motif, the 3Cpro lacks this sequence (Stamler et al. 1997). Coxsackievirus may have a selective advantage if its viral protease lacks a nitrosylation consensus sequence, decreasing cysteine reactivity to NO. The other protease of Coxsackievirus, 2Apro, is also a cysteine protease, and may be a target of NO as well.",

NO inactivation of 3Cpro could explain this reduction in both viral RNA and viral protein levels, given the characteristics of the Coxsackievirus life cycle. After Coxsackievirus enters the cell, viral RNA is translated into a large polyprotein. The 3Cpro excises itself from the polyprotein and cleaves the polyprotein into its components, including 3Dpol. This RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3Dpol then replicates the viral genome. Thus, 3Cpro processing acts upstream of viral RNA synthesis and is necessary to generate 3Dpol. Therefore, nitrosylation and inactivation of 3Cpro would be expected to block not only viral protein processing but also viral RNA synthesis.",

For example, NO could affect the RNA polymerase activity of 3Dpol. Although 3Dpol lacks the typical molecular targets of NO, cysteine residues or iron in its active site, NO could affect its activity by other mechanisms. It is also possible that NO could inactivate host proteins necessary for viral replication. The lack of effect of NO upon viral replication when NO is added to cells prior to infection argues against this possibility (Figure 1). Nonetheless, NO can affect a variety of host proteins; however, the net effect of NO upon host processes either harmful or beneficial to viral replication is unknown.",

These proteases fall into several categories based on their active site residues, including cysteine proteases, serine proteases, and aspartic proteases (35, 24, 4). NO can inhibit the replication of other viruses that encode cysteine proteases, such as members of the Picornavirus family and the Coronavirus family (45, 56). In contrast, NO does not inhibit the replication of some viruses that encode serine proteases, such as alphaviruses. However, NO also inhibits the replication of some viruses that do not encode cysteine proteases, implying that there exist other viral targets of NO. For example, the EBV transcription factor Zta and ribonucleotide reductase may be targets of NO (46, 49). Nonetheless, to our knowledge there are no viruses that have cysteine proteases that are resistant to NO.",

Furthermore, inhibitors of cysteine proteases also reduce the virulence of Streptococcus pyogenes, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Schistosoma mansoni, Naegleria fowler, and Plasmodium flaciparum. (28, 29, 3, 6, 18, 53, 67, 37, 43, 20). (For example, the malaria parasite uses its cysteine protease falcipain to degrade hemoglobin for use as a source of amino acids, and cysteine protease inhibitors block the ability of the parasite to infect erythrocytes and to replicate [18, 10].) It is striking that NO inhibits the replication of all of these parasites (45, 14, 44, 56). NO production may thus be a general mechanism by which the host defends itself against infection by viruses and other pathogens whose life cycle depends upon cysteine proteases.",
