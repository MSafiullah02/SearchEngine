Humans routinely use chemicals and can be exposed to them in everyday accidents. Although they are widely used, the impact of many chemicals on human health is still unknown. With increasing concern about the safety of chemicals, human exposure has emerged as an important issue such as humidifier disinfectants. Given the widespread use of chemicals, there are many risks associated with chemical accidents and diseases. Chemical incidents reported worldwide between 1970 and 1998 resulted in leaks, fires, and explosions involving more than 100,000 casualties [2, 3]. Since chemicals are stored in huge quantities, the magnitude and extent of damage when a chemical accident occurs can be significant [2].",

In this context, the \u201cadverse outcome pathway (AOP)\u201d is a biological pathway that disturbs homeostasis, which causes toxicity. The description of toxicity begins with chemical characterization and explains the interaction between them. Target tests to identify impacts at critical stages of the pathway and dose\u2013response extrapolation to estimate human exposure are required. Predicting ecosystem impacts requires additional population-based modeling. This is a conceptual framework for organizing existing biological information, and AOP consists of molecular initiative event (MIE), key events (KEs), and adverse outcome (AO). This independent element represents a biological response and is associated with major event relationships. The AOP concept provides instinctive risk identification to help assess the carcinogenicity of chemicals. This highlights the application of the AOP concept and the effective application of cancer prevention by predicting the carcinogenicity of chemicals [5].",

An adverse outcome (AO) is a particular type of KE, representing an endpoint of biological disturbances due to MIE.

Establishing the mode of action (MoA) hypothesis is based on causality criteria, considerations of coherence, specificity of relationships, coherent time relationships, dose\u2013response relationships, biological validity, coherence of evidence, and alternative explanations [7\u20139]. The WoE is the concept of providing evidence that meets information requirements using information from independent sources [10]. One AOP should have one MIE and one AO, but there is no limit to the number of intermediate KEs, and each KE can be included in a different AOP. Adverse outcome pathways describe the sequence of causality in biological responses to chemicals at various levels [11\u201313]. Any type of information related to a biological response (e.g., in vivo and in vitro test results, electronic data, biomarkers, etc.) may be applied to the AOP [8]. Thus, AOP is a dynamic technology that allows existing information to be more accurately changed as the technology used to monitor biological responses evolves [14]. Because AOP is expressed in a simple flowchart, it is easy to instinctively understand the side effects of chemicals, and the concept of AOP is not a sudden occurrence, but an evolution of existing concepts related to toxic mechanisms [11, 15].",

Early IPCS techniques set out some basic principles of pathway-based techniques, and MoA is defined as a series of key events along biological pathways from initial chemical interactions to toxicological consequences. One MoA was studied at a time, recognizing that MoA does not have to be complete to be useful; a chemical can have more than one MoA and may therefore be associated with multiple possibilities, each of which can be critical to toxicity studies. To establish a model for defining \u201ckey events\u201d as possible pathway steps and to systematically establish causal relationships between key events, the MoA must ensure the importance of setting quantitative parameters. In this regard, the MoA is distinguished from the mechanism of action, the latter being a more detailed description of pathways involving molecular interactions [16]. The MoA has generally been updated to accommodate insights into the pathway-based approach to risk assessment, where MoA and AOP are conceptually similar, but MoA does not necessarily imply toxic expression (e.g., effect as drugs) [16].",

Of the many reports in the burgeoning field of predictive toxicology, the US NRC\u2019s \u201c21st Century Toxicity Testing: Vision and Strategy\u201d attracted considerable attention and discussed the need for a paradigm shift in the assessment of the hazards and risks of chemicals [4, 11, 17\u201321]. The NRC report plans to change the current way of conducting toxicological tests, which are based on animal phenotypes, with techniques that are increasingly dependent on understanding the molecular mechanisms of toxicity in human cells and tissues. The transition to more mechanistic hazard assessment is the \u201chigh-throughput screening (HTS) and high-content screening (HCS)\u201d in mammalian (especially human) cell lines and/or tissue cultures. This implies the use of in vitro tests based on various calculations for data analysis and interactions between toxicity and molecular targets, side effects, and outcomes. The general premise of AOP technology means that there are sufficient events to explain biological pathways and to predict toxic pathways at different levels of biological tissue (cells, tissues/organs, organisms, populations). A basic understanding of molecular interactions and effects should be able to predict the side effects of organisms and populations.",

[11] adverse outcome pathway is a \u201ccausal, mechanical, inferential, or correlated relationship.\u201d It is a flexible technology that can include infrastructure-based connections, and the information on which they are based can include both mechanisms and MoA in vitro, in vivo, or computational systems. Adverse outcome pathway describes an MIE that occurs at the onset of chemical exposure, beginning with the interaction between the biomolecule (e.g., proteins, receptors, etc.) and the molecule and subsequently health in cells and in humans. All types of information can be integrated from the molecular level to the individual level to predict hazard consequences and provide biological arguments (or a set of hypotheses), including individual toxicity levels for hazards or environmental hazards. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the European Commission (EC) joint research centers have developed a chemical knowledge-based toxicity pathway (AOP-KB), and the AOP-KB has attracted the interest and participation of stakeholders, including government, academia, and industry, in that it provides a point of contact with academic research achievements that can be directly linked to government chemical regulation. The concept of AOP is useful for developing predictive toxicity tools, and even short-term imperfect AOPs can show the relationship between chemicals and risk. The certainty of interpretation between existing and new information can be increased, and it can be used as an integrated test strategy to maximize that certainty [22].",

Given the complexity of the ACD, a single alternative cannot replace LLNA, but integrated testing strategies (ITS) can be used to gather important information about molecular mechanisms related to skin sensitivity and to understand the molecular process of the ACD. A systematic review of in vivo studies has been carried out, and an ACD molecular map is prepared. Also, limited comparisons of toxic genomes in humans and mice have revealed similarities, although additional data are needed to identify subtle differences. For insight into the molecular mechanisms represented by various in vitro systems, comparative analysis with in vitro toxicogenomic data can be used to compare new molecular in vitro methods, in addition to mathematical predictability. In addition, new classifications by in silico, in chemico, and in vitro methods can be complemented by immobilizing AOP and ACD molecular maps, thus laying the foundation for developing test strategies that accurately reflect key events of skin sensitivity [28]. Many of these case studies have shown ways to inform AOP development in chemical hazard assessment [29]. AOP technology provides a means of organizing and sharing knowledge of the mechanisms of chemical toxicity, including quantitative structure\u2013activity relationships (QSAR) based on chemical and computational, in vitro, and integrated testing strategies, including toxicologically relevant readings. It comprises an explanatory method or integrated approaches to testing and assessment (IATA) that can be used as the basis for predictive techniques.

AOP can be used to reasonably combine mechanical knowledge related to toxicity by nanomaterials to fill data gaps and develop toxicological testing strategies, captured by AOPs selected for chemical-induced toxicity.

Cost-effective in vitro assays that can be further classified according to the degree of toxicity that may occur are being developed [52]. At the same time, biomarkers for developing preclinical endpoints that indicate the risk of death associated with a future disease or impaired lung function can also be derived from AOP [53\u201356]. In many studies, it is important to determine whether subsequent events, such as increased ROS levels compared to fresh air, include AOP-based EGFR activation and downstream signaling. AOP is a key combination of appropriate in vitro models and tests. It can provide a framework for the systematic assessment of events (KE). In addition, such AOP-based in vitro testing may ultimately be useful in knowing the dangers of chemicals and reducing their use [11, 57\u201361].",

Ultimately, studies published before genetic and epigenetic data are used to assess occupational health, and the development of occupational exposure levels (OELs) should demonstrate that these changes affect occupational exposure and toxic expression [63]; the use of computational biology and toxicogenic pathways will increasingly focus on consistent physiological changes between similar groups of toxic substances [64, 65].",

Also, new models can be developed using data collected from other sources, and the US EPA Center for computational toxicology (https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/) is a convenient platform to accommodate available models and their predictions [71]. It is important to carefully assess the variability associated with in vivo data that rely on developing new models to quantify the uncertainty associated with model prediction, and best practice protocols are being developed in in silico methods involving various endpoints [76].
