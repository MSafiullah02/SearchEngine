End\u2010tidal partial carbon dioxide pressure provides a reliable non\u2010invasive estimate of PaCO2,\n24\n and a low end\u2010tidal partial carbon dioxide pressure value would indicate a high degree of alveolar V/Q mismatching.\n15\n A marked increase in end\u2010tidal partial carbon dioxide pressure was noted in girls from 6 months to 15 months after the acute episode, but there was no further significant increase at 36 months. This finding supports the hypothesis that improved oxygenation of blood in the lungs plays a role in the documented improvement in aerobic capacity among girls. Furthermore, it would suggest that recovery of any pulmonary deficit due to SARS coronavirus infection had been established and was complete by 15 months.

            "text": "Peak oxygen pulse is a surrogate marker for cardiac function, and provides an indication of stroke volume and arteriovenous difference.\n15\n Peak oxygen pulse was significantly reduced at 6 months in children recovering from SARS, as compared with healthy control subjects,\n11\n whereas peak oxygen pulse values increased markedly at 36 months. Lin et al. demonstrated that peak oxygen pulse increased with increasing age in both girls and boys.\n25\n It is possible that pronounced deconditioning as a result of SARS resulted in a decline in stroke volume, and the low peak oxygen pulse at 6 and 15 months also supported this. Increases in peak oxygen pulse at 36 months may be the result of cardiac remodelling in response to the resumption of normal activities of daily living; however, in a study of adult SARS survivors who had a more severe disease course, stroke volume remained unaffected.\n26\n Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the improved peak oxygen pulse at 36 months in both boys and girls was more likely due to normal growth and development, rather than being associated with recovery from SARS. Arteriovenous difference is dependent on the availability of Hb, on oxygenation of blood in the lung and on the extraction of oxygen in the periphery.\n15\n Based on the fact that (i) patient Hb levels were within the normal range,\n27\n (ii) all patients achieved their target peak heart rate during the maximal exercise test, (iii) none of the patients had received a prolonged course of corticosteroid treatment, and (iv) normalization of breathing efficiency and oxygenation of blood in the lungs were established by 15 months, it is unlikely that increases in peak oxygen pulse could be explained by improvement in arteriovenous oxygen difference.",

Individuals with low aerobic capacity may experience limitation in sustaining more demanding activities, as peak VO2 is strongly correlated with time spent performing high\u2010intensity leisure\u2010time physical activities.\n28\n Aerobic capacity also contributes to cardiac workload and is associated with the growth of the heart during childhood and adolescence.\n29\n If aerobic capacity is persistently suboptimal in this group of patients, it is possible that the development of the heart would be hindered in these younger patients, as a result of insufficient cardiac workload stimulation of the left ventricle. Low aerobic capacity is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n30\n It may, therefore, be beneficial for patients to participate in a well\u2010structured moderate\u2010to\u2010high intensity exercise training program aimed at improving peak VO2. In adult SARS patients, aerobic capacity was shown to improve significantly after a 6\u2010week supervised exercise program.\n31\n\n",

Aerobic capacity was poorer at 6 months in patients who did not return for reassessment than in those who did return. A lack of motivation, and difficulty in sustaining a relatively high\u2010intensity workload during the previous exercise test, may have deterred some patients from returning for reassessment. Second, detailed assessments of physical activity were not performed for these patients. Changes in conditioning and in the habitual physical activity of these patients during the study period may also have contributed to changes in aerobic capacity at 36 months. However, to our knowledge, none of the patients participated in any routine exercise training during the study period. It is likely that the activity patterns of these patients were similar to those of other Hong Kong youngsters, which have been shown to be low.\n32\n, \n33\n Third, no comprehensive direct assessments of cardiac function were made. However, it is unlikely that there was any significant cardiac impairment as all subjects were normal at clinical examination and were able to achieve the maximum heart rates predicted for their age during peak exercise. Lastly, the reference values reported by Armstrong and Welsman\n14\n were used as local normal reference values for peak exercise tests were unavailable. McManus et al.\n21\n have shown that absolute peak VO2 values were considerably lower in younger Chinese girls and boys than in similarly aged Caucasian children; however, by adolescence, the values were comparable to the predicted values for children of corresponding ages, as reported by Armstrong and Welsman. Therefore, the effects of using normal reference values determined for a different racial group should have been minimal.",
