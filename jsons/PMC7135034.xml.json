Although it took nearly a century for the Canadian confederation, established in 1867, to achieve UHC, over these past 50 years, from a global perspective, Canada's universal health-care system is viewed as being among the world's best. With this in mind, The Lancet's Series on Canada1, 2 provides an opportune analysis of the legacy of Canada's leadership on health, and the challenges and demands ahead.",

With 12 years until the SDG end line of 2030, the prospects of achieving the world's UHC targets are daunting to say the least. Just as Tommy Douglas broke through a century of health injustice in Saskatchewan more than 50 years ago, similar breakthrough leadership from Canada to help accelerate progress on the global stage is needed now.",

The most egregious inequity in health in 2018 relates to the unequal chances of survival for mothers giving birth: why should women in Chad be at a 100 times greater risk of death giving birth than women in Canada? Unfortunately, this inequity is but a tragic indication of a much deeper problem, with a slew of further health injustices linked to lack of access to basic determinants of health, poor quality services, absence of trained providers, and pernicious payment systems that constrain women's and families' abilities to lead healthy and full lives.",

Just as Canadian leadership was instrumental in harnessing the best research to enhance global food security through the formation of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research in the 1970s,9 a comparably collaborative and ambitious initiative focused on harnessing innovation to accelerate UHC would re-assert Canada's leadership through knowledge and evidence.",
