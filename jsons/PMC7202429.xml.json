A recent study showed a significant reduction in 14 day, but not 28 day, mortality rates between patients who received IFN-\u03b12a with ribavirin and those who received standard supportive care.10 Recent in vitro data demonstrated superiority of IFN-\u03b2 over IFN-\u03b12b and IFN-\u03b12a, with IC50 values of 1.37, 21.4 and 160.8 U/mL, respectively.11 This could have major implications for MERS-CoV treatment. In the absence of effective treatment, more data on the use of different types of IFNs to treat MERS-CoV infections are crucial. Moreover, data are needed to identify patients at highest risk of mortality. We aimed to explore the association of plasma MERS-CoV RT\u2013PCR with mortality and to assess and compare the efficacy of IFN-\u03b12a or IFN-\u03b21a with ribavirin to treat MERS-CoV pneumonia.",

Additionally, the absence of fever in 5/32 patients with MERS-CoV pneumonia questions the validity of the WHO and CDC definitions of probable MERS-CoV infections, which include fever.12,13 These patients' inability to mount a fever could signal an impaired immune response, and they represent a high-risk group, evidenced by their poor outcome. Therefore, absence of fever should not preclude testing for MERS-CoV once suspected. Six healthcare workers were infected with MERS-CoV; the absence of mortality among them is probably related to the lack of risk factors in these patients. They were all <50 years of age and none had impaired renal function. The observed high number of initial negative NP swabs may be related to poor collection technique. However, lower viral loads in NP swabs compared with sputum and tracheal aspirate samples on quantitative RT\u2013PCR testing remains the most likely explanation.16 Therefore, negative NP swabs should not rule out MERS-CoV infections without testing lower respiratory tract samples. Finally, determining the duration of viral shedding in survivors of MERS-CoV infections has valuable implications for infection control.",
