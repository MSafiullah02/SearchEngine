The enormous and plentiful Tweet data has been proven to be a reliable and real-time source of information in various important analytic tasks (Ghani et al., 2019) . Note that the characteristics of Tweets are generally different from those of traditional written text such as Wikipedia and news articles, due to the typical short length of Tweets and frequent use of informal grammar as well as irregular vocabulary e.g. abbreviations, typographical errors and hashtags (Eisenstein, 2013; Han et al., 2013) . Thus this might lead to a challenge in applying existing language models pretrained on large-scale conventional text corpora with formal grammar and regular vocabulary to handle text analytic tasks on Tweet data.",

For the TWEEBANK-V2, WNUT16 and WNUT17 datasets, we use their own available training/validation/test split. The SemEval2017-Task4A and SemEval2018-Task3A datasets are provided with training and test sets only (i.e. there is not a standard split for validation), thus we sample 10% of the training set for validation and use the remaining 90% for training. We apply a \"soft\" normalization strategy to all of the experimental datasets by translating word tokens of user mentions and web/url links into special tokens @USER and HTTPURL, respectively, and converting emotion icon tokens into corresponding strings. We also use a \"hard\" strategy by further applying lexical normalization dictionaries (Aramaki, 2010; Liu et al., 2012; Han et al., 2012) to normalize word tokens in Tweets.",

Thus this confirms the effectiveness of a large-scale and domain-specific pre-trained language model for English Tweets. In future work, we will release a \"large\" version of BERTweet, which likely performs better than RoBERTa large and XLM-R large on all three evaluation tasks.",

We demonstrate the usefulness of our BERTweet by showing that BERTweet outperforms its baselines RoBERTa base and XLM-R base and helps produce better performances than the previous SOTA models for three downstream Tweet NLP tasks of POS tagging, NER, and text classification. By publicly releasing BERTweet, we hope that it can foster future research and applications of Tweet analytic tasks.",
