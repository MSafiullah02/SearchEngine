            "text": "Puppy and kitten losses within the first few months of life are a common but unavoidable problem. Postmortem examinations provide essential information for preventative strategies and should be pursued aggressively. This is particularly important when losses occur in the preweaning period, and contributing factors should be eliminated before the next breeding cycle. Postmortem examinations are also an important part of quality assurance and quality control programs of veterinary clinics and provide great opportunities for continued education when faced with the unexpected or unexplained death of a patient or a patient's death despite diagnosis-based treatment. Postmortem examinations address the owner's concern about littermates and other pets in the household, the future of the breeding program, and the owner's health. Results from a postmortem examination can also provide consolation, particularly after the difficult decision to have a pet euthanized.",

            "text": "A postmortem examination is actually a series of examinations. The gross examination during the necropsy of the animal is followed by the microscopic examination of fixed tissues (histopathology). Often additional tests on fresh tissues like microbiology (bacteriology, virology, parasitology, mycology, and serology) and/or toxicology (chemical analysis of tissues for toxins, minerals, and heavy metals) are necessary to determine the specific etiology of an identified disease process. These additional tests can be requested at time of necropsy, or samples may be collected and saved for testing at a later time, for example, when histopathology results are available and allow a focused approach to further testing to minimize expenses.",

The quick succession of developmental phases is associated with a rapid change of commonly encountered diseases to which the diagnostic approach has to be tailored. The perinatal puppy or kitten is commonly worked up as an abortion with a simplified gross examination and emphasis on histopathology and microbiological testing. In contrast, animals older than 1 day of age require a thorough and complete necropsy because gross findings determine the menu of additional tests to be performed. Before weaning, health concerns extend to littermates, the dam, and often the breeding program in general. After weaning, the problem is usually viewed as that of an individual animal and rarely of the household.",

In puppies, most deaths occur before rather than after weaning, which amount to more than 20% and less than 5% of all puppy deaths in the first year of life, respectively. More than 50% of the preweaning puppy losses occur during the first week of life. Common causes in this age group are stillbirth (incidence of 2.2% to 4.6%), trauma, failure to thrive, or congenital anomalies resulting in death or euthanasia. In puppies older than 1 week, respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases are the most common primary issues identified on postmortem examination, followed by malnutrition. In kittens, 50% of neonatal mortalities are the result of stillbirth (incidence of 4.3% to 10.1%), and an additional 25% occur in kittens less than 1 week of age. Approximately 15% of all litters have at least one kitten with one or more congenital anomalies (nearly 10% of kittens born alive). Based on histopathological examination, more than half of the kitten deaths up to 4 months of age are caused by infectious diseases, with the majority having a viral etiology. Before weaning, feline herpesvirus 1 and feline calicivirus are the main causes; after weaning, it is feline parvovirus followed by feline infectious peritonitis (corona)virus.",

This underlines the fact that a thorough gross examination and collection of a complete set of samples for histopathology and microbiology are imperative to successful postmortem diagnostics.

There is no one best necropsy protocol. Regardless of the approach, consistency is what matters most. Recognition of lesions, especially absence or displacement of organs, is greatly facilitated by a standardized approach. Suggestions for necropsy procedures with emphasis on the pediatric patient are provided in Box 31-3\n.BOX 31-3Necropsy techniqueA necropsy entails three basic tasks:1.External examination2.Exenteration of organs3.Examination of internal organs and body parts\nA list with the structures examined during a complete necropsy is given in Figure 31-9. For a more detailed necropsy protocol, see the suggested reading at the end of the chapter.Laying out the Animal and Opening of Thorax and Abdomen\n1.Place body with head facing left and tail facing right, and examine externally. Dorsal recumbency works best.2.Make a midline skin incision from chin to pubic area (avoid umbilicus and penis), and then partially skin the trunk to expose rib cage and abdominal wall.3.Transect connections of limbs to trunk in axillary and inguinal regions without cutting limbs off, and disarticulate hip joints.4.Cut through abdominal wall along midline caudal to sternum, push organs down, and pull body wall up to extend cut to pelvic aperture. Check for fluid.5.Along rib arch, extend cut through body wall bilaterally to the vertebral column. Check position of diaphragm, then cut it off along rib arch.6.Use scissors, poultry shears, or branch cutter to bilaterally cut ribs from renal area to thoracic inlet; lift sternum and ribs off by separating mediastinum from sternum. Check for fluid.7.Take samples for culture; in case of abortion/stillbirth, also for histopathology (see Figures 31-7 and 31-8).\nThoracic Cavity and Plug\n1.\nCarefully check position of all thoracic organs for completeness and position, especially for anomalies of the large vessels (once the plug is removed, these are extremely difficult to reconstruct).2.Cut bilaterally along medial aspect of mandible, and between soft and hard palate, and disarticulate hyoid bones to reflect tongue, pharynx, and larynx.3.Continue to pull tongue out and to right, and separate trachea and esophagus from neck. Continue to pull on plug to remove it out of the thoracic cavity and transect aorta, vena cava caudalis, and esophagus at the diaphragm.4.With scissors, open pericardium (leave heart attached to lungs!). Beginning in right ventricle, cut with scissors along septum up into atrium and then pulmonary artery. Start in left ventricle, cut up along septum into left atrium and (under septal leaflet of atrioventricular valve) into aorta transecting pulmonary artery above valves.5.If heart is less than 3 cm from base to apex, bisect with scalpel along long axis from apex to base perpendicular to septum to open (half) ventricles, and fix heart whole.6.Open entire length of esophagus with scissors, then larynx and trachea all the way into bronchi.7.Take samples for histopathology and additional testing (see Figures 31-7 and 31-8).\nAbdominal Cavity\n1.Before moving anything, carefully check all organs for position and completeness. Carefully examine umbilicus, umbilical arteries, vein (all the way up to liver), and urachus.2.Separate omentum with spleen from stomach and pancreas.3.Find distal colon, transect, and separate guts from mesentery as close as possible to its intestinal insertion. This will permit laying out intestines in long straight lines, which facilitates rapid opening along entire length. Be careful at the transverse colon to not cut off cecum and pancreas.4.Pull liver back from diaphragm, and transect esophagus, aorta, and caudal vena cava; lift out liver, stomach, pancreas, and guts by transecting remaining connections. Secure adrenal glands cranial to kidneys (if they are not there, check dorsal margin of liver).5.To check patency of bile duct, open duodenum and squeeze gall bladder to extrude bile. Remove liver from other organs.6.Open stomach along greater curvature from cardia to pylorus and intestines with scissors (as if cutting fabric) along mesenteric insertion to preserve Peyer's patches.7.Take samples for histopathology and additional testing (see Figures 31-7 and 31-8).\nPelvic Cavity\n1.Remove muscles from ventral aspect of pelvis, find obturator foramina, and nip cranial and caudal bony bridges (pubis and ischium).2.Free pelvic floor and lift off.3.Using caudal aperture as guideline, cut perineum around external genitalia and anus.4.Peel kidneys away from body wall.5.Pull rectum, genital, and lower urinary tract out of pelvic cavity, and lift out with kidneys attached. Open kidneys sagittally from cortex to pelvis, and peel capsule back.6.With scissors, open urinary bladder and extend cut down urethra (careful: os penis!).7.Open rectum.8.Bisect testes and epididymides or ovaries with knife.9.If large enough open uterus with scissors.10.Take samples for histopathology (see Figures 31-7 and 31-8).\nBone Marrow\n1.Free femur from surrounding muscles, and disarticulate at hip and knee.2.Scrub remaining muscle off the bone with back of knife blade.3.Place bone perpendicular across edge of table, and smash shaft with back of knife. Open induced spiral fracture by breaking shaft.4.Roll bone marrow cylinder out on glass slide for cytology.5.Fix in formalin for histopathology by immersing bone half.\nCentral Nervous SystemThis is a bit time consuming but essential if the animal showed nervous signs.Brain:\n1.Move head slightly up and down to locate atlantooccipital joint, disarticulate from ventral aspect, and transect spinal cord.2.Skin head from occiput to cranial of eyes.3.As long as bones are soft, use scissors to open skull from occipital foramen to a line connecting the caudal canthus of both eyes, and peel off crania. Otherwise, use Stryker saw, hacksaw, or meat cleaver to generate same trapezoid cut, and lift off crania.4.Cut dura mater with scissors to expose brain, and turn head upside down. Gravity will pull brain away from base of skull.5.Transect cranial nerves and olfactory bulbs with scissors, and let brain slide out into palm of hand.6.\nSamples for microbiology may include\n: small pieces of brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex; cerebrospinal fluid; swab from ventricle and/or meninges.7.\nPlace brain in tenfold volume of formalin to fix for histopathology.\n8.Check tympanic bullae at base of skull by nipping open with bone cutter.9.Sagittally cut through nose to open nasal cavity, and remove septum. Alternatively, cut nose transversely behind canine teeth.10.Enucleate eyes if examination is desired, and fix whole.\nSpinal Cord:\n1.Cut off limbs, rib, and pelvis.2.Flesh out vertebral column.3.With bone cutters, cut dorsal arch on each side of vertebrae, and reflect dorsally and back to remove. Once spinal cord is completely exposed, grasp dura mater with forceps, and gently lift out by cutting nerves and attachments as needed with scissors (leave nerve rootlets and ganglia attached).4.Open dura mater dorsally along entire length, and fix spinal cord (ideally flat) in large tub with formalin.\nTissue Identification (e.g., Left versus Right)Label paper towel or tongue depressor with pencil or permanent marker, and place tissue (mucosa facing up) on it.

The age and clinical presentation of the animal and the necropsy findings determine the most appropriate panel of samples for a diagnostic workup. The sampling checklist provided covers three scenarios frequently encountered in the pediatric patient: respiratory, gastrointestinal, and systemic (infectious) diseases. Submission of a complete set of tissue samples for histopathology is highly recommended for all disease processes. Many laboratories charge a standard fee for histopathology on necropsies regardless of the number of tissues included; subsequently, the more the better for yielding a diagnosis at no additional expense for the client. Tissue samples collected for histopathology should be no thicker than 5 mm ( inch). Samples of the heart include longitudinal sections taken from the left and right ventricle, ideally the papillary muscles, and a thin cross-section through the septum. In case of organs with multiple anatomic subunits like the kidney, adrenal gland, or testis, it is important to obtain a sample that includes all components (in the case of the kidney, these are cortex, medulla, and pelvis). Collection of multiple samples is also recommended for multilobar organs like the liver and lungs. In the case of paired organs, a sample from each side is helpful. Hollow organs like the stomach, intestines, and urinary bladder are opened up to expose the mucosa to the fixative. Hollow organs with a diameter of less than 3 mm, like the intestines of neonatal patients or ureters, can be gently filled with formalin using a syringe and needle and left unopened. The nervous system and special senses should be fixed intact. After enucleation, it is best to gently inject formalin into the posterior chamber of the globe to speed up fixation. Bone marrow cores may be fixed in formalin for histopathology and/or rolled out on glass slides and air dried for cytology. Wrapping of samples smaller than 5 mm in diameter in a paper towel reduces the risk of loss during processing. Identification of individual samples can be accomplished by submission in separate, labeled containers or wrapped in a paper towel clearly labeled with pencil, roller ball, or permanent marker and added to the remaining fixed samples.",
