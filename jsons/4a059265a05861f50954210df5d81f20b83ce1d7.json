Abstract The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a huge threaten to global health, which raise urgent demand of developing efficient therapeutic strategy. The aim of the present study is to dissect the chemical composition and the pharmacological mechanism of Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QFPD), a clinically used Chinese medicine for treating COVID-19 patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis by liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (MS), a total of 129 compounds of QFPD were putatively identified. We also constructed molecular networking of mass spectrometry data to classify these compounds into 14 main clusters, in which exhibited specific patterns of flavonoids (45%), glycosides (15%), carboxylic acids (10%), and saponins (5%). The target network model of QFPD, established by predicting and collecting the targets of identified compounds, indicated a pivotal role of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSG) in the therapeutic efficacy of QFPD. Supportively, through transcriptomic analysis of gene expression after MXSG administration in rat model of LPS-induced pneumonia, the thrombin and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway were suggested to be essential pathways for MXSG mediated anti-inflammatory effects.",

Meanwhile, 36.2% of patients had thrombocytopenia, and 33.7% of patients had leukopenia [6] . The reduction of white blood cells and platelets in the bloodstream may be a result of the overmobilization and aggregation of immune cells in the lesion area for inflammation control. The occurrence of immune cells detachment from blood vessels increases the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f risk of excessive immune response and directly leads to cytokine storms [7] .

The results suggested that at different pathological stages (both class of mild, moderate, severe, and critical, or their divided categories), the targets that change during the pathological process are different. We then deduplicated, merged the target genes of the same class, and exhibited the results in the form of Venn diagrams (Fig. 6B ). There are 233 targets in all four stages, and 376 targets appear in three stages, suggesting that in the pathological process of COVID-19, many biological processes may be shared (Supplementary Material 3) . At the same time, in the transition phase, that is, mild phase to moderate phase, moderate phase to severe phase, severe phase to critical phase, the number of common targets appeared is relatively large, 77 between the mild and the moderate, 124 between the moderate and the severe, and between 82 the severe and the critical. To further find the regular of these targets, we merged, with no repetition, all the targets and then enriched these genes by GO and pathway (using the Reactome database) method. As a result, we found that targets were enriched in the regulation of a variety of biological processes and participated in the immune response process; the corresponding molecular functions of these genes were the docking, catalysis and molecular activity regulation of proteins; meanwhile, the positions of these targets correspond to subcellular organelles and cell membrane (Fig. 6C) . This result was similar to the target network results of Qingfei Paidu Decoction, suggesting that Qingfei Paidu Decoction could be used as a promising formula to intervene in the pathological process of COVID-19. Moreover, we enriched the results of the biological process J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f from GO and the results of pathways from Reactome database, and discover the immune regulation cells was the core physiological and pathological process of the pathological process of COVID-19 (Fig. 6D) , which indicated that controlling the level of the immune response during the disease process was one of the crucial intervention to treating COVID-19.",

As a result, we found that a total of 24 genes are promising target genes of QFPD for COVID-19 (Figure 7) . Among the genes interfered by QFPD, six genes are reported as disease-related genes; 3 genes are target genes related to drug therapy, 12 genes are both disease-related genes and target genes, and 3 genes are background genes. When dissecting the compound-target relationships in the context of Toll-like receptor pathway, it is interesting to find out MH and GC, which belongs to Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction, chiefly regulated the similar targets of QFPD.

In this present study, LC-MS results suggested that the compatibility of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction increase the dissolution of ephedrine while reducing the dissolution of glycyrrhizic acid. As one of the primary material foundations of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction, ephedrine has an anti-platelet aggregation effect [48] .

First, we used the symptoms and their synonyms in the7 th edition of COVID-19 treatment guidelines as search terms and entered them into SymMap. According to the symptom-drug-compound-target cycle, the database returns the target information corresponding to the symptoms. According to the classification of syndrome types in the 7 th edition of COVID-19 treatment guidelines, we merged all collected targets and then performed enrichment analysis on targets through the DAVID database. After the enrichment analysis, we visualized the enriched results through the Enhancement Map and Annotation in Cytoscape (ver.3.7.2). Enrichment Map results only include those that contain more than 20 pathways or progresses.",

We also analyzed its chemical composition in parallel to the same LC-MS condition and investigated the synergistic effects on the content of main components, when different herbs were co-decocted and decocted individually (Figure 8A). Based on the result of element analysis, it was found that the concentration of Manganese (Mn) and Nickel (Ni) arrived ppb level in the decoction after Gypsum fibrosum (SSG) was extracted for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the first 30 min.

Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction significantly reduced the pulmonary inflammation response in vivo observed through pathological results (Supplementary Figure S3 A-E). The HE results showed that Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction attenuated the LPS-induced inflammation in lung tissue.The transcriptome of lung tissue results also showed that it was primarily related to complement and coagulation cascades, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, antigen processing and presentation, cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and IL-17 signaling pathway. These signaling pathways are closely related to the regulatory mechanism of the immune system (Supplementary Fig. S5). Vital proteins in these pathways, such as F12, F13b, F9, AT3, etc., were mainly concentrated in the blood coagulation system. These proteins were involved in the conversion of zymogen to serine protease, and eventually form thrombin, which is responsible for converting soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin clot, affecting the regulation of innate immunity. The results suggested that the thrombin system might be one of the essential ways for Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction to interfere with infection.Besides, compared with the hormone and antibiotic groups, Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction has higher safety. Safety evaluation based on HE staining, organ index, and intestinal flora were presented in SupplementaryFigure S4",

LPS stimulation is Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated response, while the combination of Poly(I:C) and Pam3CKS4 represents activation of TLR2 and TLR3. As shown in Figure 9, both LPS or combination of Poly(I:C) and Pam3CKS4 stimulation significantly elevated the cytokine IL-6 levels in RAW264.7 cells. Glycyrrhizic acid (5 \u00b5M) significantly reduced the IL-6 release of macrophage after activation with both LPS (Figure 9B) and Poly(I:C)/ Pam3CKS4 (Figure 9C), suggesting that glycyrrhizic acid may exerts moderate anti-inflammatory effects through Toll-like receptor pathways Discussion COVID-19 has brought an enormous threat to human security.

These cytokines may further induce the inflammation storm in COVID-19 [41], which is one of the most critical signs of the severe and critical condition of COVID-19, and the leading cause of patients death. Interestingly, based on the results of network pharmacology, QFPD may also regulate the downstream positions except for the Toll-like receptor 4, like PI3K, AKT, and CASP8, without interfering Toll-like receptor 2/3. Similarly, Qingfei Paidu Decoction also affects the INF-\u03b1 response induced by viral DNA or RNA invasion.
