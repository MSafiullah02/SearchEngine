The aim of this strategy is to free up inpatient beds, anesthesiology staff, health care personnel, personal protective equipment, cleaning supplies, and operating rooms (ORs) that may become intensive care units (ICUs). Moreover, a reduction in elective surgery lowers the need for ICU postoperative care of critical patients, leaving space for COVID-19 patients requiring ventilators. This strategy helps to address the COVID-19 crisis by increasing health system availability to prepare and respond to the epidemic without becoming overwhelmed.",

Any patient fulfilling any criteria for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and requiring urgent endourological surgery should be managed in a dedicated OR with a negative pressure environment and separate access from the other ORs; the same anesthesia machine must only be used for COVID-19 cases [1]. For hospitals in which a dedicated OR is not available, all postoperative cleaning protocols should adhere to institutional central disease control instructions. Access to the OR should be strictly limited to surgeons, anesthetists, and the nursing team. All training activity in the center should be suspended. Health workers must still follow occupational health and safety procedures according to the protocols provided by each hospital.",

In the current pandemic scenario, it is advisable to take extra effort to avoid the latter because of the high risk of inadvertent removal and likely long delay to subsequent surgical lithotripsy. Whenever possible, the ureteral stent or nephrostomy tube should be placed under local anesthesia, sparing a ventilator [7]. Careful review of the waiting list for stone patients can identify those at low risk for whom a procedure can be postponed. Once identified, it is advisable that the surgeon should personally inform these patients that this was a medical decision based on patient history and ongoing medical emergencies and not an administrative one.",

In some cases, infection associated with urinary stents can lead to significant morbidity such as acute pyelonephritis, bacteremia, urosepsis, and even death [8]. Therefore, this subset of patients should be considered with some priority in order to avoid an extended delay. The stent indwelling time should be a factor considered in the prioritization process, keeping in mind that the majority of ureteral stents can be left in place for up to 6\u201312 mo. At present, even though the evidence is insufficient to support antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with indwelling stents, given the likely delays in surgery, at least some pulse antibiotic therapy could be considered to reduce the risk of urosepsis and consequent requirement for a mechanical ventilator [9].",
