Previous studies of a shorter duration have reported HCoV detection rates with larger variations from 1% to 15% [15, 19\u201321]. We also found that the control group had a detection rate of similar magnitude (10.2%), as has been reported before [21, 23]. This finding may question whether HCoVs are the causal pathogen of RTIs when HCoVs are detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates. Another prominent finding was the high viral codetection rates in more than two-thirds of the infected children, as well as in the controls. Previously, somewhat lower codetection rates have been reported [10, 17, 18, 22, 30], but our finding might simply reflect the high number of virus types analyzed in our study. In the current study, children with RTIs were more likely to have a codetection of RSV and other viruses known for their potential to cause severe RTIs, whereas controls more often had a codetection of less-pathogenic viruses. This finding might also question whether HCoV caused the RTIs in this study. However, we made 3 observations on the basis of genomic loads estimations, which support that HCoV causes RTIs among hospitalized children. First, assuming that a high genomic load more than a low genomic load usually indicates an active infection, we found that children with RTIs were more likely to have a high HCoV genomic load than the controls. Second, children with a single HCoV infection were more likely to have a higher genomic load (67%) compared to those with a codetection of rhinovirus and other less-pathogenic viruses (41.8%), and those with codetections of RSV and other viruses with the potential to cause severe RTIs (24.3%). van der Hoek et al have published similar findings for HCoV subtype NL63 [16]. Finally, a high genomic load of HCoV was independently associated with RTIs in multiple logistic regression analyses, adjusted for severe viral codetections and other confounder variables.",
