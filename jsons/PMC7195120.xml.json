With a high prevalence of diabetes, it is important to understand the special aspects of COVID-19 infection in people with diabetes. This becomes even more important, as most parts of the world are seeing restrictions on mobility of patients in order to contain the pandemic. Recently our group has published an article highlighting special considerations in the management of diabetes in today\u2019s times with COVID-19 pandemic [2]. Much more data from various parts of world has accumulated since then about the association between diabetes and COVID-19, management of diabetes in those with COVID-19 infection, and innovative strategies for medical consultation in view of limited access to healthcare facilities for patients with chronic diseases.",

The levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) > 9% have been linked to a 60% increased risk of hospitalization and pneumonia-related severity during bacterial infection [3]. Past viral pandemics have witnessed the association of diabetes to increased morbidity and mortality. Diabetes was considered as independent risk factor for complications and death during 2002\u20132003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) [4]. Similarly, the presence of diabetes tripled the risk of hospitalization and quadrupled the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission during Influenza A (H1N1) infection outbreak in 2009 [5]. During the 2012 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), diabetes was prevalent in nearly 50% of population and the odds ratio (OR) for severe or critical MERS-CoV ranged from 7.2 to 15.7 in diabetic cohort [6] as compared to overall population. Mortality rate in patients with MERS who had diabetes was 35% [7,8].",

In the pooled data from the 10 Chinese studies (n = 2209) on characteristics of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, Singh et al. [9] have reported a prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and CVD in 21%, 11%, and 7% patients, respectively. Similarly, in a meta-analysis of 8 trials that included 46,248 COVID-19 patients, Yang et al. [10] reported a prevalence of 17%, 8%, and 5% for hypertension, diabetes and CVD respectively, in patients with COVID-19. Epidemiology Working Group of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that investigated 20, 982 patients of COVID-19 have shown that hypertension, diabetes and CVD were associated in nearly 13%, 5% and 4% of patients respectively [11]. In contrast, an Italian study by Onder et al. found diabetes in nearly 36%, while CVD was associated in nearly 43% of 355 patients admitted with COVID-19 [12]. Similarly, in a small study of 24 patients from United States, Bhatraju et al. [13] reported diabetes to be associated with 58.0% patient with COVID-19. While the study from the COVID-19 surveillance group of Italy (n = 481) has shown that 34% patients with COVID-19 had diabetes who died, the COVID-19 response team from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA reported a prevalence of 11% from the data of 7162 COVID-19 patients [14,15].

Wang et al. [20] in a study of 138 patients reported that 72% patients of COVID-19 with comorbidities including diabetes required admission in ICU, compared to 37% of patients without comorbidities. In an analysis of 201 patients with COVID-19, Wu et al. [24] found that diabetic patients had a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.34 (95% CI, 1.35 to 4.05; p = 0.002) for acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS). However, in the meta-analysis of 8 studies (n = 46,248) by Yang et al. [10] the odds ratio (OR) of severe COVID-19 was not significantly higher in patients with diabetes (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 0.89 to 4.82), unlike hypertension (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.46 to 3.83) and CVD (OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.88 to 6.22). Another metanalysis of 9 studies from China (n = 1936) by Chen et al. [28] found a significant correlation between COVID-19 severity and diabetes (OR, 2.67, 95% CI; 1.91 to 3.74; p < 0.01).

Based on these findings and acknowledging the higher morbidities and mortality associated with comorbidities, researchers have recently proposed that the course of treatment and prognosis of COVID-19 should be stratified based on the absence or presence of co-morbidities in to type A, B and C. While Type A represents COVID-19 patients with pneumonia with no comorbidities, Type B denotes COVID-19 pneumonia with comorbidities; and Type C denotes COVID-19 pneumonia with multi-organ dysfunction [30].",

In one study in patients with tuberculosis, patients treated with metformin had better survival than those who did not receive metformin [42]. In a median 6.2 years of follow up of 5266 patients with diabetes, Mendy et al. [43] showed that metformin was significantly associated with a decreased risk of mortality in patients with chronic lower respiratory diseases (HR: 0.30, 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.93), even after the adjustment for multiple confounding factors. In a study of 4321 patients with a follow up of 2-year period, Ho et al.

Thiazolidinediones (TZD) seen to increase the risk of pneumonia in a study when compared to sulfonylureas [45]. Experimental studies suggest that pioglitazone reduces steatohepatitis by increasing the ACE-2 expression in liver tissues [46]. This purported increase in ACE-2 expression and its relation to COVID-19 has led some researchers to propose avoiding TZD in patients with diabetes and COVID-19. Experimental studies also suggest that liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist increases the ACE-2 expression in lungs in type 1 diabetic rat and improves right ventricular hypertrophy [47]. Implications of these findings in the current context of COVID-19 and its relation to anti-diabetic drugs is not yet fully clear.",

The relationship of coronavirus to this cellular type-II transmembrane protein DPP4 (CD26) has generated a great interest recently. DPP4 serves as the receptor for MERS-CoV, in the same way as ACE-2 is the receptor for SARS CoV and SARS CoV2 [49,50]. Experimental studies have suggested that certain polymorphisms of DPP-4 are associated with reduced chance of MERS-CoV infection [51]. This finding might explain the perplexing absence of MERS-CoV cases in Africa, despite the presence of virus in camels, presumably because of frequent presence of protective polymorphisms of DPP-4 in Africans [51]. Moreover, this has generated an immense interest whether use of DPP4 inhibitors (DPP4i) can reduce the viral entry of MERS-CoV. In one in vitro study, sitagliptin, vildagliptin and saxagliptin could not block the coronavirus viral entry into cells [52].",

Moreover, a possible interaction of DPP4 and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) pathways seems to be plausible, although not completely studied. Interestingly, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I-III cleaves the Angiotensin II (1\u20138) to Angiotensin III (2\u20138) and IV (3\u20138) which has cascading favorable effect through Angiotensin-4 (AT-4) receptors. Similarly, various endo- and oligo-peptidase cleaves Angiotensin I (1-10) directly to Angiotensin (1\u20137) which has a very favorable cascading effect. This suggest that a plausible interaction of non-specific DPP-4i with ACE-2 is theoretically possible, and therefore, this area needs a future research.",

However, the adjustment of infusion rates would necessitate visit to the patient and increase exposure to the medical personnel. There is a need to explore alternate insulin administration strategies. One of these is use of subcutaneous short acting insulin analogues, an approach which has been used successfully in mild to moderate diabetic ketoacidosis; however, its safety in critically ill patients is less clear [62,63]. Secondly, single dose of basal insulin has been attempted in critically ill patients as in one study from Thailand. This could be an attractive option as it would reduce contact with the patient considerably [64] but needs more research especially in critically sick patients. Finally, insulin pump or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) could be an option and some models have the advantage of altering the insulin rates remotely via Bluetooth [65]. Fully automated closed-loop glucose control has been tried in critical illness and if feasible, could be useful in treating patients with COVID-19 [66].",

This could be a concern in people with diabetes who are at already elevated risk of infections because of many other factors. However, there is no evidence to support this hypothesis currently. In a retrospective analysis of 112 COVID-19 hospitalised patients with cardiovascular disease in Wuhan, there was no significant difference in the proportion of ACEI/ARB medication between non-survivors and survivors [72].
