The pathogen 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is now named SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is highly infectious. As of Apr. 9, 2020, over 80 000 confirmed cases had been reported, with an estimated mortality rate of 4.0% (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020) . Person-toperson transmission and familial clustering have been reported (Chan et al., 2020; Nishiura et al., 2020; Phan et al., 2020) . However, there is no evidence of fetal intrauterine infection in pregnant women who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in their third trimester (Chen et al., 2020) . It is unclear whether breastfeeding transmits the virus from previously infected and recovered mothers to their babies. Here we report the clinical course of a pregnant woman with COVID-19. In order to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to newborns through breastfeeding, we measured viral RNA in the patient's breastmilk samples at different time points after delivery.",

Tests for influenza virus type A/B, parainfluenza type I/II/III, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus were all negative. The chest computed tomography images revealed diffuse bilateral lung infiltrates. The patient received the antiviral lopinavir-ritonavir. On the third day of hospitalization, she underwent an emergency delivery by cesarean section due to a decrease in the fetal heart rate to 110 beats/min. At this time, RT-PCR testing of her sputum for SARS-CoV-2 was still positive. She delivered a baby boy with Apgar scores of 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 min post-delivery, respectively. Caution was taken during delivery to avoid contact, droplet, and airborne transmissions of the virus. At delivery, RT-PCR tests of maternal serum, urine, stool, cord blood, amniotic fluid, and placenta were negative for SARS-CoV-2. An oropharyngeal swab from the newborn baby was obtained immediately after birth, and the result revealed that the infant was negative for SARS-CoV-2. The baby was then sent to a negative-pressure isolation room in the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China), and the subsequent tests of oropharyngeal swabs, blood, stool, and urine remained negative for SARS-CoV-2. Beginning on the fourth day of hospitalization, repeated RT-PCR analyses of the mother's sputum and breastmilk were consistently negative for SARS-CoV-2. On Feb. 19, 2020, based on the current expert consensus (Xu et al., 2020) , the patient was discharged. A two-week quarantine was then required, and follow-up was needed.",

No viral RNA was detected in her breastmilk by RT-PCR, although antibodies to SARS-CoV were positive. Stockman et al. (2004) also reported a case of a pregnant woman with SARS. This woman contracted SARS-CoV in her first trimester. After recovering from SARS, she underwent a cesarean section at 36 weeks' gestation, and her infant was also not infected. Three days after delivery, since SARS-CoV was not detected in the specimens collected at delivery, she breastfed her baby (Schneider et al., 2004) . Chen et al. (2020) studied nine pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 in their third trimester. All patients underwent a cesarean section, and all nine newborns tested negative for the virus.
