First, limited demand-related information, such as the severity of injuries and the number of casualties, challenges distribution-related decision making. In particular, the incubation period results in a time delay in demand (Li et al., 1999, Zhang and Ma, 2003). Second, a disease can spread quickly from one area to another and can even become a large-scale epidemic. Infection, recovery, and mortality rates typically vary across areas because of different physical conditions of individuals, as well as habits, customs and medical services provided by the hospitals in each area (Brauer and van den Driessche, 2001, Capaldi et al., 2012). Third, the substitutability of medical relief is imperfect, unlike other forms of relief such as food. A specific medicine cannot be perfectly substituted by another medicine (Mete and Zabinsky, 2010).",

Emergency medical logistics differs from general emergency logistics in that the former involves many challenges that increase the complexity and difficulty of solving logistical problems.(2)This work applies a novel methodology to forecast the demand of multiple urgent medical reliefs and to distribute these reliefs to multiple epidemic areas. The physical and psychological situations of those affected are considered. The modified SEIR model contributes to forecasting by considering not only physical factors, such as the differences in the infection conditions of survivors and the spatial interaction relationships among epidemic areas, but also the psychological demand of exposed and undiagnosed individuals. In the distribution model, psychological fragility is formulated and discussed in detail, unlike in previous studies. The relationship between emergency medical logistics and the psychological effects on affected people is highlighted as well.(3)This work conducts a case study using real data and a continuation study with experimental data to demonstrate the applicability of the three proposed models. These models are then compared. Observations are provided and their implements are discussed on this basis.\n",

            "text": "Although some studies try to combine medical rescue with emergency logistics (Sheu and Pan, 2014), only a few studies exist on emergency medical logistics for public health emergencies despite its importance and particularity. Only bioterror response logistics, a special case in emergency medical logistics, has been discussed (Kaplan et al., 2003, Craft et al., 2005, Liu and Zhao, 2011). These studies have aided in understanding the problems of evaluating existing proposals for logistics, distributing antibiotics, and providing hospital care after a bioterror attack. Methods such as atmospheric release models, dose\u2013response models, disease progression models and epidemic diffusion models have been used. However, these studies have made limited contribution to medical logistics for public health emergencies. First, a terrorist attack has only two most feared biological agents, namely, smallpox and anthrax (Craft et al., 2005), but other public health emergencies may be aroused by other diseases that are less understood. Second, a terrorist attack focuses on only one or several cities, whereas other public health emergencies may occur in large areas at the same time. Except for the distinctiveness of bioterrorism, these studies ignored the differences in the infection conditions and survivor psychology. In practice, vulnerable groups, such as children and the elderly, face different infection, recovery, and mortality rates. Moreover, the psychological suffering of affected people in a bioterror attack is usually more serious than physical pain.",

The approaches adopted in business logistics forecast are based on historical values, which can be collected easily during business processes. By contrast, emergency medical logistics lacks historical data. Gaur et al. (2007) discussed demand uncertainty in business logistics, but demand history was unavailable. Based on the characteristics of the predictions of emergency resource demand, Sheu (2010) presented a dynamic model of relief-demand management for emergency logistics operations under imperfect information conditions in large natural disasters. Mete and Zabinsky (2010) proposed forecasting and optimization approaches to problems on medical storage and distribution for a wide variety of disaster types and magnitudes. Hasan and Ukkusuri (2011) developed a novel model to understand the cascade of the warning information flow in social networks during the hurricane evacuations. Fajardo and Gardner (2013) used a bi-linear integer program to model diseases spreading through direct human interaction on a social-contact network. Ekici et al. (2014) created an interesting approach to demand forecasting based on the characteristics of disease epidemics. They also developed a SEIR model with a spatial component among communities, age-based structure, heterogeneous mixing, and night/day differentiation to plan food distribution. Few studies have forecast demand in this way (Wang and Wang, 2008, Liu and Zhao, 2011), even though scholars have conducted much research on preventing and controlling epidemics, as well as identifying their characteristics and models.",

Most models, including the susceptible-infectious, susceptible-infectious-removed, susceptible-infectious-susceptible, susceptible-infectious-removed-susceptible, susceptible-exposed-infectious, and SEIR model, are suitable for studying the general laws of all epidemics. In particular, SEIR model, which considers incubation period, has drawn considerable attention. In the real world, there is some duration between the time that a person is infected and the time that he/she starts infecting others. SEIR model divided the people in epidemic areas into four classes: susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered. The model describes the transition among these classes with differential equations. Basic reproduction number is an important concept in epidemic model. It determines the global dynamics and the outcome of disease. If it is less than or equal to 1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally stable and the disease always dies out; otherwise, there exists a unique positive endemic equilibrium and the disease persists at an endemic equilibrium state if it initially exists (Hethcote and Tudor, 1980, Greenhalgh, 1992, Li and Muldowney, 1995, Li et al., 1999, Zhang and Ma, 2003).",

The first type of exploration covers studies that consider an ecosystem where two disease-affected populations thrive and epidemics can spread among these populations (Han et al., 2001, Chaudhuri et al., 2012). In these studies, the two populations compete for survival resource or have a predator\u2013prey relation. The second type involves age-structured models (Cha et al., 1998, Li and Song, 2011) that are unable to describe the vulnerable people because they can be distinguished not only by age but also by other characteristics, such as gender. Therefore, demand forecasting based on these models, including standard models and previous multi-class models, may forecast demand that differs markedly from the real demand of emergency logistics.",

Ben-Tal et al. (2011) applied robust optimization for dynamic evacuation traffic-flow problems with time-dependent uncertainty on demand. Liu and Ye (2014) proposed a sequential approach for humanitarian logistics in natural disasters based on the Bayesian group information updates. Allahviranloo et al. (2014) proposed three new formulations to account for different optimization strategies under uncertain demand or utility level: reliable, robust, and fuzzy selective vehicle routing problems. And they developed three parallel genetic algorithms and a classic genetic algorithm. Stochastic programming is also an appropriate tool for making emergency logistics decisions and has been applied to different cases of emergency management (Barbaroso and Arda, 2004, Beraldi et al., 2004, Chang et al., 2007, Zhan et al., 2014).

            "text": "Despite remarkable advances in emergency logistics modeling, the relationship between relief distribution and psychological utility or psychological cost for those affected has barely been assessed or formulated, although characterizing this relationship may improve the rationality of models. Disasters have negative psychological effects on affected people and can even manifest as a major depressive episode, acute stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. Hu and Sheu (2013) developed a multi-objective linear programming model to minimize total reverse logistical costs, corresponding environmental and operational risks, and psychological trauma experienced by local residents while they waited for medical treatment and removal of debris. Rooted in survival psychology and cognition theories, Sheu (2014) proposes a emergency logistics operational model that aims at disaster relief-service distribution to maximize survivor resilience. In Hu et al. (2014), a mixed-integer linear program is constructed for multi-step evacuation and temporary resettlement under minimization of panic-induced psychological penalty cost, psychological intervention cost, and costs associated with transportation and building shelters. Negative psychological effects of widespread disease epidemics are usually more significant. For the public, the psychological effect of an epidemic may be greater than the danger to physical health (Cheng and Tang, 2004). Maunder et al. (2003) examined the psychological and the occupational effects of SARS in a large hospital in Canada in 2003. Their study showed that patients with SARS reported fear, loneliness, boredom and anger and worried about the adverse effects of quarantine and their contagiousness on family members and friends. The patients experienced anxiety about fever and the effects of insomnia. Healthy people were also adversely affected by the fear of contagion and infecting their family, friends, and colleagues. Other studies on SARS have reported similar findings (Wang and Luo, 2003, Cheng and Cheung, 2005, Leung et al., 2005). These studies have identified approaches that can alleviate psychological suffering, such as symmetric information, on-time treatment, effective prophylactic methods, and social support. Most approaches have been considered part of medical logistics.",

Dctors and medical experts can generally estimate the expected values of these parameters shortly after a new disease is recognized in a region. In this study, they are obtained from several medical reports and statistics (National Health and Family Planning Commission of P.R. China, 2004; Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention; Kamps and Hoffmann, 2003). (3) Infection rates are set with two methods. First, these rates can be obtained by fitting the forecasting curve with observations given epidemic areas with adequate infectious cases. In this study, the infection rates in Guangzhou (j\n = 1) and Zhongshan (j\n = 5) are set in this manner. The objective function of fitting is to minimize \u2211k=1Nobsk-estk2/\u2211k=1Nobsk2+\u2211k=1Nestk2, where obsk refers to the kth observed value and estk refers to the kth estimated value.

As a result, the average infection rate decrease slightly although the total distributed amount does not increase.(2)The total amount of treatment reliefs distributed increases when survivor psychology is considered. In the process, psychological fragility declines significantly.(3)The amount of reliefs distributed increase for epidemic areas with a large input population that originates from severely infected areas when the spatial interaction relationships among epidemic areas are considered. In this case, additional prophylactic reliefs are sent to Shenzhen (j\n = 6) to avoid the spread of SARS. The reason for this outcome is that this area has a large input population coming from Guangzhou (j\n = 1) and Zhongshan (j\n = 5). These areas are the most severely. Moreover, the number of residents in Shenzhen (j\n = 6) is small. Guangzhou (j\n = 1) is less affected although the input from Zhongshan (j\n = 5) to this area (j\n = 1) is larger given that Guangzhou (j\n = 1) has much more residents.(4)The amount of prophylactic reliefs distributed increases for epidemic areas with low diagnosis rates when survivor psychology is considered. In this case, the diagnosis rate of Heyuan (j\n = 4) is the lowest and many infectious people have not realized that they are infected. Infectious but undiagnosed individuals share a physical state with those who have been diagnosed, but their psychological characteristics differ. Therefore, more prophylactic relief is sent to Heyuan (j\n = 4) in Extended Model 2 than in Extended Model 1.(5)The number of distribution paths that report long transportation times decreases when survivor psychology is considered. A long distribution time increases psychological fragility. In this case, the distribution paths from EMRC 4 to Guangzhou (j\n = 1) and to Jiangmen (j\n = 3) are avoided in Extended Model 2, unlike in the other two models. In a case of emergency medical logistics following a large-scale disaster, the effect of survivor psychology on path selection is strengthened because destroyed infrastructure may increase transportation time.\n",

Moreover, the total amount of treatment reliefs distributed increases when survivor psychology is considered, thus reducing psychological fragility considerably.(2)All four situations show the results similar to those in the third observation made by analyzing real data. That is, more prophylactic reliefs are distributed to epidemic areas with large input populations that originate from severely infected areas when the spatial interaction relationships among such areas are considered.(3)Situations 2 and 4 display results similar to those in the fourth observation made by analyzing real data. More prophylactic reliefs are sent to areas with low diagnosis rates when survivor psychology is considered. However, Situations 1 and 3 fail to provide strong evidence for these changes. The effect of the variation in prophylactic relief on physical and psychological fragility is insignificant in these situations given the low infection rate.(4)In all four experimental situations, distribution paths that report long transportation times are avoided when survivor psychology is considered, as in the analysis with real data.\n",

Aside from inducing health threats and economic losses, public health emergencies also have negative psychological effects on both patients and healthy people. Affected people may feel helplessness, sorrow, panic, anxiety, and fear. Such individuals may even develop mental illnesses. Widespread serious psychological problems may also threaten economic order and public security. Numerical results show that the consideration of survivor psychology significantly reduces the psychological fragility of affected people and that it hardly affects the physical fragility. Aside from highlighting survivor psychology, this work also indicates the benefits of considering the spatial interaction relationships among epidemic areas, especially in response to public health emergencies with high infection rates in areas with high population density.",

Additional treatment reliefs generally help improve psychological states. Conversely, prophylactic reliefs are significant to epidemics with long incubation periods. Such reliefs do not exert physical effects on exposed people, and such individuals cannot infect others. However, psychological effects remain. Similarly, the psychological suffering of infectious but undiagnosed people is affected by prophylactic rather than treatment reliefs. Therefore, additional prophylactic but not treatment reliefs are sent to areas with low diagnosis rates. The increase in diagnosis rate lowers the demand for prophylactic reliefs and the corresponding logistics capacity.",

Furthermore, survivor psychology is discussed on the basis of providing the public with transparent information. However, emergency logistics may influence affected people in different ways as a result of imperfect information. Therefore, additional research must be conducted to explain this issue.
