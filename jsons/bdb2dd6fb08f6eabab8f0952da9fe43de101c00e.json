It is believed to be related to an initial cluster of pneumonia cases associated with a seafood and fresh meat market in Wuhan, China, [2] . Current case rates at the time of writing are close to one million with close to 60,000 deaths. The genomic relationships to other coronaviruses were quickly examined by Lu et al. to shed light on the origins, epidemiology, and receptor binding of the virus [2] . On January 17th , 2019, the Wuhan isolate Genbank entry MN908947.3 replaced MN908947.2, and MN908947.3 probably represents an adequate stable description of the sequence for research into that strain isolate, and was immediately investigated by the present author [3, 4] . Originally, it was seen by authorities as a coronavirus outbreak but not as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). However, its genomic relationships examined in refs [3, 4] also showed many fairly close correlations with the genomes of SARS-CoV in the previous human (but not pandemic) outbreaks and in pigs, bats and civets, and the emphasis was on finding subsequences that are well conserved across coronavirus strains and species. The earliest patients suffering from what is now called COVID-19 had overall 99\u00b798% genome sequence identity to the above Wuhan isolate, so that one may reasonably say that it is the origin of COVID-19, and its virus SARS-Cov-2 [2] . The earlier Wuhan isolates also related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, China, but differed more from SARS-CoV (at about 79%) and MERS-CoV (at about 50%) [2] . The Wuhan and related isolates revealed a coronavirus that resides in the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus [2] , and although genetically distinct from its predecessor SARS-CoV it appeared to have similar external binding proteins, meaning here the spike glycoprotein discussed extensively in the present paper. See Section 1.3 below for introduction to this protein, which also discusses some further early identified genomic correlations.

It might also present challenges for tertiary prevention, which seeks to remedy a persistent level of infection, or to prevent recurrence even to essentially the same strain, as discussed in Section 1.2. A main problem of concern, and a point of the present paper, is the likely appearance of new strains with resistance to vaccines and therapeutic agents. At the time of writing, confirmed cases double globally every 6 days, and undetected cases are expected to be much higher (the current plateauing of reported cases in China offers a glimpse that this this should attenuate soon, but estimates of how and when are varied). With a significant portion of humanity already infected, there is enhanced probability of successful \"escape mutations\" in the genome of the virus.

They include SARS-CoV (2002, Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus), and MERS-CoV (2012, Betacoronavirus, subgenus Merbecovirus). Although the idea that SARS-CoV-2 was distinct from SARS-CoV was originally discouraged, distinction is here a matter of degree.

The KRSFIEDLLFNKV protein subsequence was seen as a potential Achilles' heel because it is exposed or potentially exposable, being required for proteolytic activation cleavage, and importantly is also a well-conserved feature on the surface of the virus [3, 4] . Being well conserved suggests that mutations are much less easily \"accepted\", meaning that the virus is less likely to survive more than one or two generations. As discussed below, the conservation is in a region of protein on the virus surface concerned with at least one step of lung cell entry, interesting because coronaviruses seem to be able readily adjust to alternative means of entry, possibly hinting at additional roles for the subsequence. Whether or not that is the case, the above motif seems a likely primary target for synthetic vaccines and a basis for drug discovery, and was proposed as such [3, 4] . It is a motif that was found to be quite well conserved even in more distantly related coronaviruses [3, 4] , and the present paper also explores how far that seems to extend. It includes the common cold coronaviruses. Another potential subsequence of interest popular with researchers is also examined (the ACE2 binding domain discussed below), but the above remains popular with the present author because of its relatively high degree of conservation. present authors' opinion, however, it relates to a specter that recently haunted COVID-19 vaccine research, and which might still cause some concerns. This is the question of why there is no significant immunity acquired by the body to prevent recurrence of common cold, of which up to roughly 30% of cases are believed to be due to coronaviruses. Fortunately, at time of final writing of this paper, news reports indicate that neutralizing antibodies can be found in patients who have had COVID-19. However, with the risks of escape mutations of the virus in mind, it remains worthwhile considering whether the subsequence KRSFIEDLLFNKV, again, found to be well conserved [3, 4] across many coronaviruses [3, 4] , is still present in common cold coronavirus. This is in order to force better immune response by targeting using synthetic or cloned vaccines with this epitope. Most common cold strains fall into one of two coronavirus serotypes: OC43-like and 229E-like, which are the main examples discussed below. While the common cold is generally considered as mainly an upper respiratory tract infection and a mundane inconvenience, common human coronaviruses Betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, as well as Alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E, also cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in children and the elderly.

At the time of the current project, only the three dimensional structures of the SARS-CoV spike proteins of the earlier SARS outbreak was known (e.g. ref [8] ), which has only 75%-81% sequence match to SARS-CoV-2 [3] . Note that it is customary to write SARS-CoV rather than SARS-CoV-1. RNA viruses mutate with high frequency but so far the differences in spike proteins in emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants are much less. At the time of the study in late February and early March 2020, the amino acid residue sequences of the spike proteins of COVID-19 isolates from different states and countries, such as California, Brazil, Taiwan, and India, remain identical or almost so. For example, with respect to the original Wuhan isolate [2] , phenylalanine (F) is replaced by cysteine (C) as residue 797 in a Swedish isolate, and alanine (A) is replaced by valine (V) as residue 990 in an Indian isolate. As of 21 st March 2020, largest variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genome as a whole show 99.9% nucleotide sequence match, which for a genome of 29,858 RNA bases, suggests approximately 30 base changes, and of the order of 5 in the spike glycoprotein gene of 3821 nucleotides. That then suggests roughly 1 to 3 amino acid differences in the spike protein of current (March 2020) SARS-CoV-2 variants, consistent with the above more specific observations of isolates from California etc. A single amino acid change can, of course, sometimes have significant effect, e.g. on the aggressive character of a coronavirus, and so be considered as creating a new strain. Some new strains are being reported at the time of writing, but to the author's knowledge none of them are spike protein variations, and more specifically none are as yet in the KRSFIEDLLFNKV subsequence. The left hand side of Fig. 1 shows the SARS-CoV (previous SARS) S1 spike glycoprotein within the trimer that makes up the spike. The right hand side shows SARS-CoV-2, the SARS of current concern. All human SARS coronaviruses (and indeed the spike proteins of many other related coronaviruses) appear similar in overall conformation, and the variations seen in experimental structures are probably more to do with crystallization or other preparation methods, particularly regarding solvent details and ligands. SARS-CoV, on the left, has been well studied and still serves as the reference model. In order to fuse with and infect cells, the spike protein needs to be in an open state; presumably the closed state makes it less vulnerable to antibodies. On the left, Fig. 1 also shows the approximate positions of the cleavage points superimposed on the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 5XLR for SARS-CoV. Reading from the N-terminus of S1, the important functional elements of SARS coronaviruses deduced from SARS-CoV studies [5, 6] and applicable to SARS-CoV-2 are the S1 Nterminal domain (S1-NTD), the S1 C-terminal domain (S1-CTD), the S1/S2 site as the first protease cleavage site as a loop between a pleated sheet and a-helix, the fusion peptide (FP) associated with a highly disordered loop between two a-helices which contains the second cleavage site S2', and a heptad repeat (HR). The Arginine (R) in the conserved motif KRSFIEDLLFNKV that was of interest in the previous study [2] is the cleavage point in S2'.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 406, "end": 409, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 465, "end": 468, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 981, "end": 984, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3031, "end": 3034, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3035, "end": 3037, "text": "6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3493, "end": 3496, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2030, "end": 2036, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2774, "end": 2780, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "The Spike Glycoprotein."}, {"text": "Recall that the KRSFIEDLLFNKV subsequence associated with S2' is potentially important, not least because it must be exposed or exposable (because it permits proteolytic cleavage) and therefore the site cannot be well shielded. The experimental three dimensional structures of coronavirus spike proteins do not for the most part reveal the large amount of glycosylation that protects most of the spike protein surface. Possibly the major problem, however, is not so much in the selection of accessible surface regions as a basis for design entry inhibitor and vaccine design [8, 9] but that the coronavirus readily escapes from such agents by mutation, including in the spike protein [10, 11] . This is the further importance of being a highly conserved motif, i.e. a subsequence that does not readily change from strain to strain except for a conservative sidechain replacement in more remote strains. Of course, as one carries the study forward to more distantly related viruses, one expects the motif to differ at some stage, and this is investigated later below. In contrast, nonetheless, the PIGAG motif \"associate with the S1/S2 cleavage site disappears in coronaviruses that are not too distantly related [3, 4] . As noted above, a high degree of conservation of KRSFIEDLLFNKV in the face of genetic indicates that it is in some way important to the virus, presumably for the proteolytic activation cleavage, and/or initial binding to lung cells, but there could be other interactions with other proteins, i.e. to reduce an inflammatory response, as discussed later below.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 575, "end": 578, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 579, "end": 581, "text": "9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 684, "end": 688, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 689, "end": 692, "text": "11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1212, "end": 1215, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1216, "end": 1218, "text": "4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Spike Glycoprotein."}, {"text": "Agents.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Review of Strategies for Design of Synthetic Vaccines and Pharmaceutical"}, {"text": "Modern computer-driven strategies, and the kind of chemical products that they help produce, differ substantially from the earlier and more familiar approaches in which the computer played little if any role. In large part this is due to the invention of automatable peptide synthesis by Merrifield in 1963, who used solid phase peptide synthesis based on crosslinked polystyrene beads [12] . Traditional vaccines are purely biological, being composed of dead or attenuated strains of pathogen (meaning mainly, viruses and bacteria). In contrast, a synthetic vaccine is a vaccine consisting mainly of synthetic peptides but also sometimes carbohydrates, often linked to a carrier protein to render it immunogenic. Such vaccines produced via chemical synthesis are safer because they do not involve cell-derived material or biological processes for production. Their purity can be controlled as in the case of classical drugs. The world's first synthetic vaccine was created in 1982 from diphtheria toxin by Louis Chedid (scientist) from the Pasteur Institute and Michael Sela from the Weizmann Institute. In 1986, Manuel Elkin Patarroyo created SPf66, the first version of a synthetic vaccine for Malaria. Primarily applications so far have been veterinary. Many early vaccines used dead samples of foot and mouth disease virus to inoculate animals, but they caused real outbreaks. Scientists discovered that a vaccine could be made using only a single key protein from the virus, and later also found that loops from the surface proteins could be cloned or used in cloned or synthetic constructs. Novartis Vaccine and Diagnostics, among other companies, developed a synthetic approach that very rapidly generates vaccine viruses from amino acid sequence data in order to be able to administer vaccinations early in a pandemic outbreak.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 386, "end": 390, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Review of Strategies for Design of Synthetic Vaccines and Pharmaceutical"}, {"text": "Traditional vaccines have so far remained the popular choice, but during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, they only became available in large quantities after the peak of human infections. This was a learning experience for vaccine companies. Creating vaccines synthetically would be currently more expensive but has the ability to increase the speed of production and to retune and fine tune the solution to combat new variations in pathogens. This is all especially important in the event of a pandemic. Synthetic vaccines are also considered to be safer by researchers than vaccines grown from e.g. eggs or from bacterial cultures (in the latter case there may even be other viruses present). Cloned proteins can however reflect the same desirable principles; regions of pathogen amino acid sequence acting as epitopes (see below) can be presented as loops at the surface of a cloned protein. The general idea is that synthetic vaccines are freer of contaminants and focus on the essential features of the required immune response. They can also be developed in a more logical step by step approach. For example, sometimes diagnostics are considered as a useful early step on the way to a vaccine, since they are only required to raise antibodies in animals such as sheep for diagnostic kit production, not to be safe in humans and also raise immune system memory and a cellular as well as antibody response.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Review of Strategies for Design of Synthetic Vaccines and Pharmaceutical"}, {"text": "Synthetic vaccines also have the advantage that they can be seen as cartridge vaccines, meaning that they contain bits and pieces that can readily be replaced by others to update the vaccine in order to combat new strains of pathogen. A synthetic vaccine thus has several functional components, looking somewhat like a Swiss Army Knife under the electron microscope. The key component reproduces the essential features of a pathogen protein that the immune system sees. It is an epitope that typically means a patch of some 5 to 20 amino acid residues. Reproduced as a short peptide, epitopes can be considered as haptens. Haptens are substances with a low molecular weight such as peptides, small proteins and drug molecules that are generally not immunogenic and require the aid of a carrier protein to stimulate a response from the immune system in the form of antibody production. There are two main types of epitope, B and T, discussed in Theory Section 2. A synthetic vaccine consists of T-epitopes as haptens (for cell response and immune system memory), molecular adjuvant (e.g. muramyl dipeptide), and possibly excitatory or anti-inhibitory peptides. B-epitopes are good for raising antibodies in e.g. sheep to use in diagnostics/biosensors, all attached to, or cloned into, a carrier protein. The latter must be safe but at the same time sufficiently different from any human protein to avoid autoimmune disease. Used extensively as a carrier protein in the production of antibodies for research, biotechnology and therapeutic applications, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) is the most widely employed carrier protein, and least for studies using laboratory animals. For humans the food and drug authorities may have other preferences for carrier protein, but KLH illustrates the desired features. Its large size and numerous epitopes generate a substantial immune response, and abundance of lysine residues for coupling haptens allows a high hapten:carrier protein ratio, increasing the likelihood of generating hapten-specific antibodies. Because KLH is derived from the limpet, a gastropod, it is phylogenetically distant from mammalian proteins, thus reducing false positives in immunologically-based research techniques in mammalian model organisms, and clinically avoiding autoimmune effects. So far, the food and drug authorities do not seem to have favored synthetic vaccines for human use, but this may be more to do with the peptides themselves than the carrier proteins available. The earlier methods of peptide synthesis did not achieve high levels of purity. However, this has changed and quite elaborate peptides as well as proteins can be made, facilitated by making peptide synthesizers run fast to avoid the slower side reactions, and by methods that join shorter synthetic peptides into longer chains [43] [44] [45] [46] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2828, "end": 2832, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2833, "end": 2837, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2838, "end": 2842, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2843, "end": 2847, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Review of Strategies for Design of Synthetic Vaccines and Pharmaceutical"}, {"text": "One of the original motivations for the present study was to capture experience and design strategies from vaccine, diagnostic and antagonist design [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .

However, the author's reticence has been largely based on cost, including cost in changing traditional production strategy, and in the reservations of food and drug authorities, but fairly recently all that appears to be changing. THPdb (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/thpdb/) includes an example of a manually curated repository of peptides and related molecules approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Over some 70 peptide drugs are approved in the US and other major markets, and those in pipelines and in or approaching clinical trials may now be exceeding 200 entries. As natural compounds, peptide drugs are typically less toxic than more traditional chemical candidates. Although D-amino acids are not natural features of ribosomal production of peptides and proteins, human metabolism can handle them. They occur in gut microbes and ingested material and in human proteins they form spontaneously in a kind of aging process from some amino acids in situ in protein sequences (e.g. L to D-aspartate). Diverse D-amino acids such as D-serine, D-aspartate, D-alanine, and D-cysteine are found as free amino acids and small peptides as well as in some proteins, and quite commonly in mammals. They are often found having playing important roles in the nervous system. For example, N-Methyl-Daspartate (NMDA) receptors are associated with learning and memory and D-Serine, Daspartate, and D-alanine bind to those receptors. Hydrogen sulfide generated from Dcysteine reduces disulfide bonds in receptors and potentiates their activity. Peptides made of D-amino acids resist not only normal proteolytic degradation but also resist an immune response (unless attached to a carry protein) [44, 46] . They persist some 4-6 days in the body, which is an ideal time period for pharmaceutical action, and are ultimately degraded to safe products (probably mainly in the peroxisomes and by enzymes in the kidneys) [44, 46] .

In most cases, the spatial locations of hydrogen atoms are deduced rather than seen in experimental protein and peptide three dimensional structures. This is likely to impact considerations of docking ligands to protein targets. In the present author's opinion, this provides a beneficial possibility for retroinverso designs [3] made by reversing the sequence and using D-amino acids that has the unfortunate or complicating effect of interchanging the C=O and N-H groups in the backbone of the synthetic peptide [3] . The beneficial possibility is that, for example, a repulsive C=O\u2026O=C electrostatic interaction between a synthetic peptide and the spike protein could be ameliorated in the manner C=O\u2026H\u2026O=C where the H is a water, serine or threonine hydrogen atom, or by C=O\u2026H-O-H\u2026O=C, albeit that in practice the water molecule likely lies more to the side of the O..O interaction vector. Somewhat similar considerations apply to any N-H\u2026H-N interactions that can ameliorated by the lone pair orbitals of an oxygen atom. Both could also involve tautomerization and/or rearrangement of internal hydrogen bonding networks (e.g. in the manner \u2026O-H\u2026O-H\u2026. to \u2026H-O..H-O\u2026). Today, to take care of such matters, researchers consider docking of ligand to protein and high grade molecular dynamics simulations of the overall solute-solvent system by molecular dynamics, at least as the final refinement step [50] , but even the awareness that the above compensations and others can take place can make it worthwhile to synthesize and test a proposal. Somewhat similarly, design of peptide synthetic vaccines and diagnostics can make direct use of peptides duplicating sequence motifs in the pathogen protein found by bioinformatics and relatively simple computational tools. After that, researchers often go straight to synthesis and experimental immunological testing of the constructs rather than using complex simulations [51] [52] [53] . Epitope predictions for SARS-CoV-2 (simply meaning the choice of amino acid residue subsequences to synthesize for synthetic vaccines, but also for peptidomimetic antagonists) have been made by several authors (e.g. ref [54] ).

Studies specifically investigating human protein binding and activation of previously known SARS viruses have for some years been carried out by several groups (e.g. [54] [55] [56] [57] ). It seems reasonably well agreed that angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) is responsible for binding the SARS associated with the 2002 outbreak, combined with a proteolytic cleavage to activate the spike protein, for which type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) is the current popular candidate [3] .

The origin of the general problem for a more detailed conformational chemistry approach is that diversity of genome and means of infecting cells are readily generated in nature in the case of different virus hosts, virus strains, and species jumps, and it is long established that the binding shows variation in the receptors used that correspond to viral groups. There have been alternative proposed candidates for initial binding receptors, e.g. carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), and various dipeptidyl peptidases. Highly virulent coronaviruses that form syncytia between cells can even spread in a receptor-independent fashion. Even when an initial binding receptor such as ACE2 is identified for a coronavirus, initial uncertainty or enduring complexity for the rest of the entry process may be the norm. Many other human proteases present in the lung seem capable of cleaving various sites on the spike protein and which could cause its activation. For example, a variety of proteases such as trypsin, tryptase Clara, mini-plasmin, human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), and TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease, serine 2) are known to cleave the glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A viruses as prerequisite for the fusion between viral and host cell membranes and viral cell entry. Human airway trypsin like protease (HAT), TMPRSS3, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS6 have also all been considered by SARS researchers at various stages. Other human proteins that might have similar involvement to the above in the SARS-CoV-2 case, and that are also affected by the same antagonists against the SARS-Cov-2 targets in the preceding paragraph, have also attracted the attention of researchers. The trypsin-like serine protease hepsin which has a fairly broad action and which is significantly inhibited by a diverse set of ligands, a particular example of one such binding is represented by protein data bank entry 5ce1. Even intracellular proteases could be released on cell damage resulting from the first wave of lung infection or from other disease or tissue trauma. Some variants and strains may use other, as yet unknown, proteins, or sugars, to assist entry. It is also plausible the spike protein might be activated by other proteases on exit from the epithelial lung cells, so allowing it efficiently to infect other cells. The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 also has the so-called furin cleavage sequence (PRRARS or PRRARS), which is an extension to the so-called PIGAG motif of ref [3] . Consistent with the present author's preferred choice of KRSFIEDLLFNKV motif, coronaviruses with high sequence homology (such as that isolated from a bat in Yunnan in 2013), lack the furin cleavage sequence. Nonetheless, because furin proteases are abundant in the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein might be cleaved on exit from cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2763, "end": 2766, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Human Protein Targets for Design of Therapeutics against COVID-19."}, {"text": "Even if the means of binding, activation and entry is well established for a viral strain, recall that a single RNA base difference resulting in a single amino acid residue difference could alter all that, and there also appear to be several other possibilities that the virus can exploit in parallel.

Pharmaceutical chemists have long used evidence and hunches to deduce a pharmacophore, i.e. an abstract description of recurrent molecular features that are necessary for molecular recognition of the ligand by the protein [3] . A pharmacophore ultimately implies at least a schematic model of the interfacial surface between ligand and protein, but in practice, a pharmacophore tends to be either considered from the perception of the ligand (one compares similar inhibitors etc.) or from the perception of the binding site (one compares positions of key residues in the binding site). The choice depends on the quality of each kind of data, but could involve both. Historically, drug design was frequently based only on indirect deduction of binding site features using the chemical features of the ligands which successfully inhibit (or in a few instances excite) a response. This is essentially the use of Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR). In effect the perception of the binding site was indirect and typically based on the chemist's expertise and hunches, and so often extremely \"fuzzy\". Subsequent elucidation of many protein structures with clear pictures of their binding sites led to a crisper physical perspective, exemplified by a study [50] that included many ligand molecules in the present investigation, and so faced some similar issues.

In such circumstances, the conservation of the KRSFIEDLLFNKV motif might be considered suspicious. The activation cleavage is at the arginine (R) and workers tend to conclude that this site is more essential for action than S1/S2, and mutation of the arginine (R) specifically inhibits trypsindependent fusion in both cell-cell fusion and laboratory assays. But also, with the arginine retained, many other proteases can active the spike protein as above, and others can do so in laboratory conditions. Because of the conservation, one might therefore hold the seemingly reasonable hypothesis that this site is not also susceptible to cleavage and activation by other extracellular proteolytic enzymes, but also doing something else. Whether or not this is so, all this complexity makes detailed interaction models of spike protein binding and activation difficult, and while the \"best bet\" for ranking the choices of target protein may currently seem obvious, making a reasonable, currently conventional, choice which is actually an incorrect assumption can delay productive research into therapeutic agents. In the case of the hunt for prevention and cure of virus diseases, and particularly COVID-19, there seems to be increased justification for a \"fuzzier\" set-theoretic picture of a pharmacophore as an ensemble of different binding sites, or of ligands in a ligand-oriented perspective, as follows. Many of these, and perhaps all, suggest that even if one is using an incorrect picture of the mechanisms of entry and replication, even using the \"wrong\" or less important protein target, one might achieve some success. In brief summary, the justifications for the ensemble pharmacophore in the coronavirus case, i.e. the contributions to \"fuzziness\", include parsimony, that proteins and parts of proteins sometimes have more than one function [12] encouraged by limited numbers of accessible sites (due to e.g. glycosylation) and exemplified by parallel alternative mechanisms of cell entry, multiple methods of drug action, escape from scientific defense measures by virus mutation, polymorphism of human proteins involved, different expression levels of human proteins involved, and the potential problem of the \"specter of vaccine development\" (concerns about missing the appropriate region of the virus that allows common cold viruses to escape the appropriate immune response). To the above may be of course added the fact that even if an experimental researcher is convinced of the value a specific protein as appropriate target, the picture for the computational chemist is a fuzzy one. The system itself, real and simulated, is to be seen as a statistical mechanical ensemble of multiple states, sampled over the population of molecules and across their conformational behavior in time. Not least, protein binding sites are often partially disordered before binding, and in any case there may be several binding modes. Picking the right one can be difficult because there is a fine balance between solvent and conformational entropy, and entropy is notoriously hard to compute [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2141, "end": 2145, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3383, "end": 3387, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Pharmacophore Approach."}, {"text": "Given this argued uncertainty as to the nature of the target protein and its binding site, a broader initial net as an ensemble pharmacophore can help. Docking approaches are continually being improved by researchers, and recently include ways of combining features that could ultimately relate to different protein binding sites. While many authors of these studies include the word \"ensemble\" in their discussion of pharmacophores, they appeared to be significantly different to the particular means of combining multiple pharmacophores that was explored here. However, the present author has had his attention drawn to some that are rather similar and the approach of Kumar [33] appears to particularly akin, especially in regard to distributions of expected values and use of weighting. Kumar's description [33] thus suffices, and briefly stated, it explores the ability of an ensemble of selected protein-ligand complexes to populate pharmacophore space in the ligand binding site, assesses the importance of pharmacophore features using Poisson statistical and information-theoretic entropy calculations, and generates the pharmacophore models with high probabilities. A scoring function then combines all the resultant high-scoring pharmacophore models. There is one significant operational difference between Kumar's approach and that used here. Recall that in the more traditional docking approach, it is the ligand as candidate drug that is typically seen as the variable and constantly changing and in many studies \"evolving\" the ligand chemistry with the pharmacophore is the basis of drug design [29] [30] [31] [32] .

This seems less efficient from the point of view of designing candidates, and not even as smart as the older single, non-probabilistic pharmacophore approaches [29] [30] [31] [32] .

Similar molecules, and importantly emodin itself, are also inhibitors of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, an example of a steroid binding enzyme [62] . It is normally anchored within the endoplasmic reticulum through an Nterminal transmembrane domain. Its involvement as a protein target is here based on a chemical justification. A biological justification might be that this enzyme is involved in the inflammation response which a coronavirus might also benefit by inhibiting. If so, the goal is not, of course, to help the virus by inhibiting at the same target which it would also gain by inhibiting, but rather to inhibit protein targets more crucial to it, i.e. for cell entry and possibly replication which are even more crucial to the virus. Some inhibition of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 might even be a desirable thing because excessive or prolonged inflammation (including in response to pathogens) is well known to be potentially damaging to the host. An excessive inappropriate immune response may also include the basis of allergic reactions and even of autoimmune diseases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 767, "end": 771, "text": "[59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 772, "end": 775, "text": "60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 850, "end": 853, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 854, "end": 857, "text": "61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1017, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A More Controversial Selection of a Representative Protein as"}, {"text": "A pragmatic reason for this choice of protein as pharmacophore is that was also one of those protein-ligand interaction systems that have been well studied by the present author and collaborators [50] .

By the term \"epitope\" in this paper is meant \"continuous epitope\", though several smaller epitopes may be joined to represent a discontinuous epitope in which conformation and relative position in space can sometimes be important. While a synthetic construct implies the use of synthetic chemistry typically combined with a judicious carrier protein to which the peptide is linked chemically, constructs can also be obtained by cloning, using protein engineering principles [12] . The terms B-epitope and T-epitope relate to the traditional picture of a bone marrow B or thymus T response. B cell epitopes occur at the surface of the protein against which an immune system response is required. They are recognized by B cell receptors or antibodies in their native structure, and are concerned with the bone marrow response and antibody production. T epitopes may be buried inside protein structures and released by proteolysis, and are traditionally considered as concerned with a cellular response and immune system memory, i.e. active immunity. Continuous B cell epitope prediction is very similar to T cell epitope prediction. The focus is on B-epitopes here, though a Bepitope can also be (or overlap with) a T-epitope especially if it has a significant content of hydrophobic residues. Prediction of these has traditionally been based has mainly been based on the amino acid properties such as hydrophilicity, charge, exposed surface area and secondary structure.

Biodegradability per se of peptides is not the main concern, since including D-amino acids in the design prevents proteolysis. In preliminary docking and simulation studies, the peptides do bind to 11\u03b2hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, but less strongly and with several binding modes [3] . This weaker binding is not in itself a contraindication of the idea that these peptides bind at the same site as the more rigid non-peptide molecules, because it is an expected consequence of the much greater flexibility of peptides compared with molecules with, for example, multiple aromatic ring scaffolds. Conventional wisdom (e.g. ref [12] ) frequently uses the rule-of-thumb that the total change in intramolecular (bond rotational) entropy of a peptide ligand is roughly T\u2206S Total = 1.5 kcal\u22c5mol \u22121 per residue at 300 K, corresponding approximately to a 12-fold reduction in conformational freedom per residue on binding. Because van der Wall's and hydrogen bonding tend to be very roughly equivalent for peptides in water and in well bound forms, the water entropy effects known as hydrophobic effects (along with electrostatic forces) play an important role in determining the balance of energies and final outcome. KRSFIEDLLFNKV would thus cost about +19.5 kcal/mole entropic contribution to bind rigidly, primarily compensated by hydrophobic contacts at up to about -1.7 kcal/mole in going from an aqueous to a non-polar environment, i.e. -22.1 kcal/mole for a 13 residue peptide or analogue of KRSFIEDLLFNKV. That example would not favor binding, but the proper calculation is in the details which of should show balance that favors good binding if that is found to be the case experimentally. Despite the above comments, the flexibility of peptides does provide more opportunities to fit a specific binding site, i.e. they can show some accommodation and they are more tolerant to imperfections in the design process.

They are somewhat unorthodox by focusing on heuristics to handle the multiple energy minimum problem, but the end effect is probably similar to that of long runs using high grade molecular dynamics calculations, given opportunities for calibration [50] . Epitope predictions lie in more traditional \"one dimensional\" bioinformatics, and in this paper and the previous paper depended on predictions using a GOR4 secondary structure prediction of \u03b1-helix (h), extended chain or \u03b2-sheet (e), and coil or loop (c). The reason for this and the particular use of GOR4 is discussed in ref [3] , but briefly, it is in part because sections predicted by runs of c tend to be immunogenic even if they are incorrect as structure predictions [3] . However, charged residues in \u03b1-helices and \u03b2sheets are believed to be occasionally B-epitopes, and short sections extended chain can effectively imply loops.

These can be recognized irrespective of the peptides, or in the context of the adjacent amino acid residues. Conformation and exposure of B-peptide epitopes of glycoproteins may be modulated by glycosylation because of intramolecular carbohydrate-protein interactions. The beneficial versus undesirable effects of glycosylation in synthetic vaccines is also a complex matter. Glycosylation may be essential for reactivity with the antibody, but conversely it may in effect inactivate the capabilities of a section of amino acid sequence to function as a B-epitope, which seems to be a very good reason for giving the glycosylation motif a strong negative rather than positive score. Unfortunately this will depend on the structure of the antigenic site and antibody fine specificity, and the recognition mechanisms involved are not fully clear.

However, the appearance of the COVID-19 KRSFIEDLLFNKV motif does appear in common cold coronaviruses and with typically at most two relatively conservative substitutions. That is in the sense of preserving hydrophobic sidechain as discussed above in Methods Section 3. The conservative aspartate (D) and asparagine (N) replacement is also fairly common in the motif in the sequences examined. An example shown below is a Clustal Omega alignment of the COVID-19 virus spike protein original Wuhan Seafood Market isolate (GenBank entry MN908947.3) with spike proteins representatives members of the two major common cold coronaviruses strains 229E and OC43 (GenBank Entries NP_073551.1 and AIV41987.1).

In the sequence (not shown) of HCoV-HKU1 which is often associated with more serious cases of cold-like diseases the above motif is still noticeable as RSFFEDLLFDKV in which the isoleucine (I) is replaced by phenylalanine (F). The \"A for F\" modified motif RSAIEDLLFDKV is also found in the coronaviruses of dogs, cats, rodents, pigs, rabbits, camels, ferret badgers, raccoon dogs, amongst others. All of these might be eaten by humans in certain countries and notably they are, for the most part, species that live in close proximity to humans. The \"PIGAG\" motif does not show up in the above alignment, as is also the case in many other distantly related coronaviruses [3, 4] . However there is a subsequence PIGTNYRSCESTT in the HCoV-HKU1 spike protein that appears to relate to PIGAGICASYQTQ in the COVID-19 virus (recall that HCoV-HKU1 is a common cold virus, albeit usually associated with more severe, lower respiratory tract cases). In contrast, not only does the KRSFIEDLLFNKV motif stand out as potentially important to the COVID-9 virus by virtue of such comparisons, but also a match with that motif is almost the only continuous stretch of amino acid residues in most alignments like that above.

The most noticeable variation is the occasional substitution of the cleavage point arginine (R) by a G.

In that respect, there is a lack of charged residues (acidic and basic sidechains) in the extended chain of the spike glycoprotein in structure 6VW1, although an aspartic acid (D) replaces the serine (S) in some strains, arginine (R) replaces asparagine (N) in others, and so on (e.g. see BLASTp alignments later below).

As even Fig. 2 suffice to makes clear, however, the extended chain, like any so-called extended chain in proteins in practice, is essentially a visible helix of larger pitch, resembling a very stretched-out \u03b1-helix, and is itself slightly supercoiled to wrap around the ACE2 \u03b1-helix.

While the above regarding ACE2 binding must be kept in mind for antagonist development, as noted above the motif is not well conserved, and so could be prone to development of escape mutations, i.e. acquired resistance to vaccines and therapeutic antagonists. Because of the dominant theme of an ACE2 \u03b1-helix interacting with an extended chain loop of the spike glycoprotein, the structure of the interaction region is fairly easy to deduce for various SARS strains, and there was as yet no obvious strongly recurrent theme of significant conserved residues that are discontinuous (i.e. not together in the same subsequence) that could be interacting closely with ACE2.

RT (where R is the gas constant and T the absolute temperature) is 0.593 at 298 o K, i.e. circa 0.6 at biological temperatures, so 1 kcal/mole is not significant above thermal noise. Free energies of 2, 3, 4, and 5 correspond to binding association constants of 5, 148, 786, and 4160. The above free energies are usually expressed as negative, for the perspective from the associated system. Considering that absolute values are much less reliable than relative values in this field, one might conservatively consider a binding energy of -3.5 kcal/mole as worthy justification for keeping a compound on a list, if one does not wish to reject prematurely, and this seems reasonable if one still has in mind the refutation principle. This includes the mental picture that a model pharmacophore such as 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 has a fairly large cavity which does not provide strong steric inhibition to the candidate ligands, but new evidence might show that a large ligand such as a steroid might be too big to fit the real target which the experimental data is describing.

It should be stated, nonetheless, that any case for any common evolutionary relationship between this dehydrogenase and the spike protein binding receptor ACE2 would be, at best, marginal. 11\u03b2hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 has 292 residues and ACE2 has 613. There is a 24% identity match of amino acid residues in the region of best possible match of the dehydrogenase. There is also further 19% conservative substitution (CLUSTAL ':', i.e. conservation between groups of strongly similar properties with a score greater than .5 on the PAM 250 matrix). If taken alone, this would provide some basis for further exploring a relationship. Admittedly, the conventional rule of thumb is that any two sequences are considered homologous if they are more than 30% exact amino acid residue matches, and strictly speaking this should apply over their entire lengths (this is discussed in Chapter 8 of ref [12] and a brief review of standard tools is given in refs [2] and [38] ). Nonetheless, caution is required because the 30% exact match criterion is well known to miss many easily detected homologs and 15-20% is sometime found supported by evidence of evolutionary and functional relationship. For example, alignments between common cold and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins already discussed above are in this range, but there is every good reason to believe a common ancestry, there is an overall conformational similarity, and essential features of some sequence motifs are preserved. There is some sense of comparable fold motifs with ACE2 comprising two 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 folds.

The most substantial data base of results that can reasonably be considered final is in large part from the original studies [50] . There carbenoxolone was automatically evolved (by automatic editing of its chemical structure) under the combined selective pressure of improve binding to 11\u03b2hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 while avoiding significant match with compounds covered by all US patents [50] , and subsequent docking and high grade molecular dynamic simulations were carried out on IBM's Blue Gene [50] .

In such a case involving minor variations as sidechains on the original steroid core, the way to make initial fit to using carbenoxolone as guide is obvious. However, the flat view of a steroid is misleading. The steroid ring system can \"buckle\" in various cis-trans combinations of bonds in the rings, and the longer sidechain conformations preferred on the basis of intramolecular energy are perhaps not obvious. Although the rotation barriers for most of the transitions are clearly above the thermal energy (kT) energy conformations (0.6 kcal/mole), the associated energy demands for buckling of parts of the steroid ring system of variously and roughly 2.5 to 5.0 kcal/mole are less that the ligand-receptor binding the associated energy demands are below the gain in energy from ligand-receptor binding to the protein target.

These compounds are also shown more clearly from the chemist's perspective in two dimensional formula format, later below. Fig. 4 shows one of early analogues of carbenoxolone (the thioketone derivative cboS1 discussed later below) in the 11\u03b2hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 steroid binding site. The particular interest in this compound is as follows. Since in the original study [50] KRUNCH judged this as the strongest binder at -16.8 kcal/mole, this compound was frequently used as a starting template for initial docking configurations when using KRUNCH. This is even though (a) it is probably an unlikely choice for a chemist to use in practice because of likely oligimerization of the thioketone groups, and even though (b) Corphos (also known as Cortisol 21-phosphate, Cortisol, phosphate, Hydrocortisone-21-phosphate or 21-Hydrocortisonephosphoric acid) was the strongest at -16.8 kcal mole when using instead the AMBER force field for molecular dynamics on IBM's Blue Gene [50] . The thioketone still retained a reasonable binding energy of -16.3 kcal/mole in the latter study, however, i.e. effectively the same binding strength within the state of the art. Fig.  4 does not of itself give details of any ligand-protein interactions (but see discussion in refs [3, 49] ), although it does illustrate the tightest of fit. That is, except to the lower right of the thioketone ring of the ligand, which does appear to relate to genuine opportunities for additional groups to be added to carbenoxolone at that position. Carbenoxolone and initial closely related derivatives derived in that study [50] are shown in Fig. 4 , binding in the range, -17 to -14 kcal/mole. Accuracy and limited realism of such methods does not really justify more precise statements on binding energy, and the classification of binding below is as strong, medium, and weak, but see ref [50] for more detail on some of the compounds. Authors variously consider binding energies -5 to -9 as a safe requirement for significant binding, but again this is subject to considerations of accuracy and almost all agree that it is only the relative values that are significant. Note that while they are often interpreteted as estimates of binding free energy, the entropy component, particularly of the aqueous solvent and solute-solvent intercations, is difficult to estimate. Experimental binding values of ligands in general in biological systems typically range from -4 to -16 kcal/mole, though over 95% lie in the range -7 to -13 kcal/mole.

Fig. 7 shows some weaker binding results using Krunch [50] . Great caution is required in drawing conclusions from the compounds in Fig. 3 . Camostat is definitely of interest as an inhibitor of the ACE2 protein to which the spike protein initially binds for cell entry and does seem effective in blocking entry [74] , and similarly hepsin results are of related interest, e.g. as it is a potential alternative entry point. The ACE inhibitors also looked initially interesting by virtue of certain similarities to the other potential ligands, and of course because of their binding in this theoretical study, but most of the traditional ACE inhibitors are commonly viewed as not inhibiting ACE 2. Taking a drug such as Valsartan that acts on ACE might up-regulate ACE2, so facilitating virus entry, [75] but emerging information is revealing a complicated picture: see Discussion and Conclusions. There are possible explanations that would still allow for competing with spike protein binding, but these seem somewhat unlikely. Most probably, the binding is sufficiently weak that the normal substrate, and also the spike protein, displace it. Aromatic group interactions may be important here [76] . Organic Compounds Binding the Pharmacophore. Weak Binders. Selected known drugs or proposals (caution: use of ACE inhibitors might be counterproductive, see text). The estimated binding energy is in the range -5 to -7 kcal/mole. Some consideration has been given to prediction of ligand binding site motifs, but so far these have proven essentially negative as regards interesting results that might shed any further light on the above, although some clues may well have been missed. Binding sites are often comprised of conserved residues that are not contiguous (continuous in a sequence), which will require further and more detailed study, although subsequences of 2 to 6 amino acid residues in length are worthy of a quick preliminary study because they are commonly involved in ligand interactions. The matches involved in here as judged by BLASTp and Clustal Omega are not statistically significant, but one might think of weak matches as ligand binding site predictions in much the same way that one thinks of epitope predictions. In much of the present paper, the structure of emodin, carbenoxolone and related compounds have involved discussion of aromatic rings and hence phenylananine (F), tyrosine (Y) and tryptophan (W) and more generally amino acid residues with hydrophobic character. Very polar subsequences are also strong binders of charged ligands, or have a role for charged molecules or inorganic ions in some way. As far as such subsequences in the coronavirus spike protein are concerned, very polar charge-pattern motifs such DRETS and DREDS are common in ligand binding some of the molecules that may be of interest as antagonizing SARS entry, activation or replication in some way, in the present author's experience. Specifically, motifs like this were of initial interest in the present project because SARS-CoV) nonstructural proteins have zinc finger motifs, and RET and especially RED are common in PROSITE motifs at https://prosite.expasy.org/cgibin/prosite/prosite_search_full.pl, including zinc-finger motifs. This is not considered directly relevant to the spike protein but, for example respectively in GenBank entry AIA62240.1 and DREDS and DRETS align with SRLDKV in three-way Clustal Omega alignment with SRLDK of the original Wuhan spike protein sequence MN908947.3 and DRLDT of NP_073551.1 spike protein. However, these and many similar alignments also illustrate considerable sequence variation, and the weak matches are not close in the sequence to the subsequences of interest neither for coronavirus spike protein nor human proteins of potential discussed above. As far as ACE2 is concerned, the closes match with DRETS and DREGS is DRKKPS, but this weak match again lays well away from regions of current interest, e.g. in the sequence from the region that interacts with the spike glycoprotein.

As regards ACE2, its mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs. Studying SARS entry into human cells, Hamming et al. [78] considered their most remarkable finding to be the substantial surface expression of ACE2 protein not only on lung alveolar epithelial cells but also enterocytes of the small intestine, as in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organ studied (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain). There is the attractive prospect that several many herbal remedies considered as laxatives interact with ACE2 and inhibit SARS-CoVid-2 entry. Recall that emodin is an antagonist of both ACE2 [59] [60] [61] and 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 [62] . In the past, 11\u03b2hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 has been considered to be distributed mainly in the human liver, with no detectable levels in the intestine or kidney, mostly membranebound and retained in the liver microsomal fraction [79] . This was not however the finding of Bruley et al. 80] . They found it to be highly expressed in glucocorticoid target tissues including liver and notably the lung, and modest levels in the brain. It was also found in modest levels in adipose tissue where it is of medical interest that selective increase expression occurs in obese humans and rodents and is likely to be of pathogenic importance in the metabolic syndrome [80] .

It is well known that some COVID-19 patients complain of stomach upsets and diarrhea. To recapitulate the essential themes in terms of action in the alimentary tract, recall again that emodin had earlier been shown by several groups of researchers (e.g. ref [79] ) to inhibit SARS-CoV entry into cells (apparently initially by binding ACE2), and emodin is taken as a herbal laxative. Licorice has, conversely, been sometimes taken as a soother for alimentary disorders, and carbenoxolone has been used commercially in the past specifically to treat peptic ulcers. Intriguingly, carbenoxolone is also known to influence the renin-angiotensin system involving ACE2, so at least there appears to be a connection in terms of networks of physiological control. As noted above, while traditionally 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 has been thought of as a liver enzyme, many researchers have indicated that both ACE2 and the dehydrogenase are available in both lung and intestinal tract (e.g. refs [78] [79] [80] ). This all hints also that some of the other laxatives that work in a similar stimulatory way might block viral entry on ACE2 and perhaps other targets, and should be explored. Of course, absolutely nothing should be done by patients without physician direction, because dosages are difficult matters (not least in herbal products) and there are potentially serious side effects on such as salt balance and blood pressure, and some might cause birth defects, all potentially worse than COVID-19 would be, for most people. But more worryingly still, the situation is not settled, and physicians and patients could take action in the wrong direction. Gurwitz [81] has emphasized that the picture is even more complex. He examined reports from China suggesting that a mechanism of production of lung injury during the viral infection may be due to excess free angiotensin-II, which might be displaced from ACE2 by the SARS virus particles. If so, then increasing the amount of ACE-2 could be desirable and administering angiotensin receptor antagonists could beneficially upregulate the production of ACE-2.

It remains that this motif is one of very few subsequences that still recognizable when moving on to rather distantly related coronaviruses such as those of the common cold.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "[KR](G?)S[AILF][AILF]ED[IL]LF[ANDS]KV"}, {"text": "One feature of both Figs. 5 to 7 is of course the constant appearance of aromatic rings, and this is also noticeable in many of the studies of antagonist's against SARS virus binding and activation. Of course, the aromatic (i.e. benzene) ring makes copious appearance in many pharmaceutical agents in any event, because they provide rigid scaffolds for added groups supported by many long-established recipes for synthesis. The compounds in Figs. 5 to 7 should be distinguished from those such as Lopinavar, Ritonar, Promazine and particularly Niclosamide that have been explored for SARS viruses in the past, because these are targeted by drug designers against the SARS virus own protease required for maturation of the assembling virus. Nonetheless, some of these do have a visual similarity to the compounds in Fig. 3 , particularly Niclosamide (which is normally a medication used to treat tapeworm infestation). Also, in the present case, prevalence of aromatic rings in Figs 1 to 3 is hardly surprising, since carbenoxolone and derivatives shown in Fig. 1 were the starting point for their evolution or selection from the ZINC data base. Nonetheless, there is, in principle, nothing to constrain the evolution to aromatic chemistry [50] and later unpublished studies did produce molecules departing from aromatic chemistry.

The answer is: perhaps. There seems to be a need to have one aromatic ring present in the motif, and no match with a coronavirus in GeneBank was detected by the author by BLAST-p using queries with no phenylalanine (F), e.g. RSAIEDLLLDKV, RSAIEDLLIDKV, RSAIEDLLADKV, RSAIEDLLMDKV, RSAIEDLLWDKV, and RSAIEDLLYDKV as queries, though as also noted above, the search has not been exhaustive. It would not be too contradictory to any of the current main hypotheses if some examples were found.

One very relevant report in the same month of writing the present paper emphasizes that the use of protein and other fragments to characterize binding pocket and determine the strengths of ligand-protein interactions is common in both a computational and experimental approach, and that aromatic interactions are both strong and need special attention [76] . Because of resonance and the special nature of the \u03c0 orbitals, the strength of stacking is best calculated using high level quantum mechanical approaches, not empirical force fields [76] . However, as these calculations are performed in vacuum, solvation properties are neglected, and this led to the proposal of a Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory (GIST) to describe the properties of individual heteroaromatics and complexes; this gave good correlation for the estimated desolvation penalty and the experimental binding free energy, and prediction of binding sites [76] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 543, "end": 547, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 732, "end": 736, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1123, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Comments on Potential Therapeutic Antagonists."}, {"text": "A main conclusion is that peptide KRSFIEDLLFNKV remains of special interest as well conserved across coronaviruses.

M. Dirac in human and animal medicine in accordance with the charter of The Dirac Foundation , to emphasize the advantages and simplicity of the basic form of the Hyperbolic Dirac Net, to encourage its use, and to propose at least some of the principles of the associated Q-UEL, a universal exchange language for medicine, as a basis for a standard for interoperability. These mathematical and engineering principles are used, amongst many others in an integrated way, in the algorithms and internal architectural features of the BioIngine.com, a distributed system developed by Ingine Inc. Cleveland, Ohio, for the mining of, and inference from, Very Big Data for commercial purposes. Immediately prior to joining IBM in 1998 he was hired as Principal Scientist at MDL Information Systems in California to help put together the technology for the multimillion sale of a bioinformatics system to the holding company forming Craig Venter's Celera Genomics that produced the first draft of the human genome. Prior to that, he was CSO of Gryphon Sciences (later Gryphon Pharmaceuticals) in South San Francisco, California, a bio-nanotechnology ultrastructural chemistry start-up largely held and then acquired by SmithKline Beecham. Before moving to the US, Barry was the scientific founder of Proteus International plc in the UK, designing and leading the development of the PROMETHEUS Expert System and its underlying GLOBAL Expert System, bioinformatics and simulation language for drug, vaccine, and diagnostic discovery. It sold for the equivalent of $9.4 million to the pharmaceutical industry in the mid-1990s. At Proteus, he also led the team that used the above Expert System to invent and patent several diagnostics and vaccines including the Mad Cow disease diagnostic subsequently marketed worldwide by Abbott. He has some 300 scientific publications including some 50 patents and two books: \"The Engines of Hippocrates. From the Dawn of Medicine to Medical and Pharmaceutical Informatics\" Robson and Baek, 2009, Wiley, 600 pages)\" and \"Introduction to Proteins and Protein Engineering\" (B. Robson and J. Garnier, 1984 Garnier, , 1988 , Elsevier, 700 pages). He has contributed to several reports to governments including Panels of the National Innovation Initiative including \"Innovate America\" Published by The Council on Competitiveness, Washington D.C. (2004) as a whitepaper to the President of the United States. For five years, Barry was a Nature \"News and Views\" Correspondent on biomolecules.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2595, "end": 2608, "text": "Garnier, 1984", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2609, "end": 2624, "text": "Garnier, , 1988", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}]}
