The 2014\u20132016 outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa resulted in over 11 000 deaths, many of whom were health workers. In fact, in 2015, the Lancet reported that \u2018by May 2015, 0.02% of Guinea's population had died due to Ebola, compared with 1.45% of the country's doctors, nurses, and midwives. In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the differences are more dramatic, with 0.11% and 0.06% of the general population killed by Ebola versus 8.07% of the health\u2010care workers in Liberia, and 6.85% in Sierra Leone\u2019. (Evans et al. 2015). At that time, ICN called on governments to create safe workplaces and, along with the European Federation of Nurses Associations, called for full protection of the nursing workforce. Likewise, the SARS outbreak in 2003 also raised concerns about protection of healthcare workers. Globally, 20 per cent of confirmed SARS cases were healthcare workers. In Canada, healthcare workers made up 43 per cent of SARS cases. (Branswell 2013)",

This means more than just supporting the structure of team\u2010based, person\u2010centred care, which allows the most appropriately prepared provider to deliver services based on a patient's needs and preferences, at the right time and in the right place. It means ensuring our nursing staff is appropriately trained to administer heath care in safe and supportive work environments which will not result in damage to the health of the professional administering the care. It also means countries must invest in pandemic preparedness where nurses are part of the planning to ensure systems include immunization as well as worker protections for any outbreaks.",
