The digital has indeed become 'the master narrative of our world' (Fuller and Jandri\u0107 2019: 215 ); yet, the biological is more important than ever. Social media have evolved from toys for spending pastime to our essential communication lifelines; digital payments exceed cash flow (Agarwal 2020) . Digital devices track people's movements, strongly reminiscing dystopian science fiction movies from the past (Torbet 2020) , reviving 'disciplinary diagrams' of surveillance and control (Foucault in Peters et al. 2020) . However, these newly minted postdigital reconfigurations between the digital and the physical sphere are far from cast in stone. 'Dialogue through postdigital conversations offers the possibly to unlearn in order to relearn, together; this is hope.' (Jandri\u0107 et al. 2018: 173) .",

Together with crowdfunding initiatives to raise money for healthcare equipment in hospitals and vulnerable collectives, there are many creative and supportive initiatives which promote free, open culture, and worldwide solidarity. On April 8, members of ultra-right-wing parties organized YouTube demonstrations, calling for government's immediate dismissal after the end of the state of emergency; their claim was supported by estimated 450.000 people (Portillo 2020) . One day later, the Union of Actors and Actresses complained to the Ministry of Culture about their lack of support to cultural sector and organized a cultural strike by symbolic network 'blackout': participants agreed to neither share nor consume cultural content from 23:59 on Thursday April 9 until 23:59 on Saturday April 11 (Archyde 2020; Spain News 2020).",

When we become aware of interdependence that defines us as human beings, world solidarity emerges. Free sharing of information and research data, which characterizes the pandemic, is a historically unprecedented move towards openness of information and knowledge. Sharing, and especially its breathtaking speed-inherent to virality-is essential for world's quick and efficient response to the pandemic (Peters et al. 2020 ). Yet, this interdependence, which unites and frees us, also has its dark side. We are simultaneously dealing with virulent behavior in the organic world (Jandri\u0107 2020) , and with 'viral modernity' that illustrates the 'role of information and forms of bioinformation in the social world' (Peters et al. 2020: 3) .",

Conspiracy theories that incriminate, stereotype or bias, are used across the ideological spectrum. Companies monetize global panic and endanger public safety by increasing prices of necessary products (World Health Organization 2020b).

Covid-19 is a practical case in the point for the well-known theoretical idea: in order to build a solidary, social, and ecological future, we need a fundamentally different kind of economics (Mair 2020) . In order to mitigate impacts of the coronavirus, Spain could be the first country in Europe introducing Universal Basic Income on a long-term basis (Ng 2020) . The general secretary of the government argues that such a measure would imply that households deprived of income as a result of this crisis would receive financial aid (see Mason 2020) . Alongside other measures, such as pausing mortgage payments (Togoh 2020) , Universal Basic Income could be a decisive policy for economic recovery after the lockdown. Despite public requests, similar Universal Basic Income initiative has been rejected in the UK, whose government believes that its investments in welfare state are sufficient (Ng 2020) .",

Thus, claims Chomsky (in Polychroniou 2020) , shortage of ventilators and other medical supplies is merely a manifestation of the perversions of the neoliberal system. We critique value judgments and political decisions which lack solidarity and empathy, but many of us are not aware that politics also resides in our gaze.

While this is a nice gesture which should not be under-valued, there are more than 42,000 people living in overcrowded camps and about 10% of them are minors (The Associated Press 2020). These people live under unbearable conditions, and waves of anti-migrant violence deprive them from their last glimpses of human dignity: clothing and food (Fallon and Grant 2020) . With restrictive migration measures promoted throughout Europe, they need to choose between returning to an almost certain death and trying to survive at the gates of what they see as a dignified and humane future. From this perspective, solidarity implies much more than humanitarian aid; it requires a recognition that we are all equal, and that our struggles are common. According to Paulo Freire, 'the true generosity consists precisely in fighting to destroy the causes which nourish false charity. False charity constrains the fearful and subdued, the \"rejects of life\", to extend their trembling hands.' (Freire 1970: 45) .",

As academics and educators, we have an important responsibility: instead of returning to old 'normality,' we need to create a new reality where true interdependence is recognized and solidarity remains true to its essence.
