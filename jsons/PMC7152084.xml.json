From Odysseus\u2019s story to Achilles, the actual word (term) that provoked and transformed Hector to a rage and frenzy, \u201clyssa,\u201d is closely linked to the word \u201clykos\u201d or \u201cwolf\u201d and is used to invoke images and feelings of an animal\u2019s anger, madness, and wolfish rage.1 Lyssavirus is a genus of RNA viruses in the family Rhabdoviridae, order Mononegavirales. Lyssaviruses are bullet-shaped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses and the causative agents of the ancient zoonosis rabies. Africa is the likely home to the ancestors of taxa residing within the genus Lyssavirus, family Rhabdoviridae. Diverse lyssaviruses are envisioned as coevolving with bats, as the ultimate reservoirs, over seemingly millions of years (Fig. 5.1\n).2\n",

Many people still believe today that rabies treatment requires 20 or more shots into the stomach by some monstrously long needle. While in fact, today\u2019s treatment regimen is typically only four vaccinations (five for immunocompromised individuals) in the arm, plus a dose of humane rabies immune globulin (HRIG). This myth is but one of a long list of questions, untruths, or exaggerations about the disease known as rabies.\u2022Is there a way to vaccinate wildlife using a recombinant vaccine dropped from aircraft?3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\n\u2022Can scientists actually determine the origin of a rabies virus variant by way of genetic testing and methodologies?3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\n\u2022Are there special government laboratories that conduct specialized rabies testing?3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\n\u2022Can international public health teams actually halt and remove a moving viral epizootic outbreak in a geographical area?3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\n\u2022Is there a relationship between rabies and zombies?15\n\n",

There are many untruths to unpack with respect to the prevalence of rabies. Learn more in the following accounts:\u2022Many people believe that rabies infections only occur in poor, third-world countries. However, the truth is that rabies or rabies-like viruses are present on nearly every continent, with the exception of Antarctica. Numerous and diverse variants of lyssaviruses are found in a wide variety of animal species throughout the world, all of which may cause fatal human rabies. Rabies virus is by far the most common lyssavirus infection of humans. In the United States, only Hawaii is rabies free. Interestingly, in Hawaii and other rabies-free areas that are often islands, there are very strict laws and restrictions on the transport of animals from rabies-endemic states or countries to rabies-free geographic locations. In the United States, rabies as a disease is most prevalent along the East Coast (raccoon and bat rabies virus variants) from Florida to Maine and in Southern Arizona (Arizona gray fox) along the Mexican border. Rabies is also prevalent in Texas with south central skunk and bat rabies virus variants predominating.\n",

There may be a need to plan for preexposure vaccinations (e.g., rabies, yellow fever, etc.) or medications (e.g., malaria, antibiotics) to take on their travels.16\n\u2022A frequent belief is that this disease kills many people in the United States. However, approximately 95% of human deaths from the disease occur in Africa and Asia, where access to health-care facilities and treatment protocols is limited. The estimated annual figure of almost 59,000 rabies fatalities in humans is probably an underestimate. Almost all cases of rabies in humans worldwide result from bites from infected dogs.17, 18 Rabies cases in humans in the United States are rare, with only one to three cases reported annually. Forty three cases of rabies in humans have been reported in the United States and its territories from January 2003 through November 2018 (Table 5.1). Almost all of the cases are attributed to bat rabies with 11 of the total cases contracted outside of the United States and its territories. Of the 43 rabies cases, there were three survivors (40 deaths). For 2018, there have been three cases, with the most recent case (death) being a 74-year-old male from Utah from bat rabies (not included in Table 1).19\n\u2022All warm-blooded animals can contract rabies, particularly mammals. A viral disease of the central nervous system, rabies transmits between animals, including humans, when saliva containing the virus enters an opening in the skin. Usually, the rabies virus enters through the bite of a rabid animal, but transmission can also occur when infected saliva enters through mucous membranes or a break in the skin. Viral familial relatives can be found with invertebrates and plants (distant hosts), but warm-blooded vertebrates are the hosts for the rabies virus. Among warm-blooded vertebrates, birds are susceptible to infection, but rabies predominates naturally among various mammalian populations. Only rare accounts occur in nonmammalian hosts, but in the Mammalia family, rabies cases have occurred from the armadillo to the zebra. Rabies is a significant disease of domestic and wild mammals alike, yet its zoonotic aspect is the cause of major historical infamy.2\n\n",

The following are a few of the common ones:\u2022On a given warm summer evening in areas of Texas just as dark approaches, bats start swooping in their feeding mode of eating insects, which is an ecologic and biologic benefit. This could initiate a warning from some folks about \u201cbats getting tangled in your hair,\u201d leading to being exposed to rabies. Of course, bats are not attracted to a person\u2019s head of hair and do not try to \u201cnest\u201d there, but if a bat did get tangled in someone\u2019s hair, they would receive PEP if the bat could not be tested as its too close a contact to rule out a bite occurring. However, contributing to this misconception could be media and historical writings with respect to vampire lore surrounding bats.1 Additionally, there were even popular television series like The Andy Griffith Show that had an episode with Barney Fife discussing bats in caves and their potential for laying \u201ctheir eggs\u201d in a person\u2019s hair (Fig. 5.2\n).24\n\u2022Can I get rabies if I handle blood, feces, or urine? The simple answer is no in this scenario. Rabies is not transmitted through the blood, urine, or feces of an infected animal, nor is it spread airborne through the open environment. Saliva provides the primary transmission medium when the animal is in the infectious stage of rabies. For the rabies virus to get to the salivary glands, it has to travel first from the site of entry (usually a bite wound) through the animal\u2019s nervous system, then to the brain. This is what causes most rabid animals to exhibit abnormal behaviors, depending on what part of the brain is infected. Finally, the virus travels to the salivary glands during the terminal stage of rabies. It is this later stage of rabies when an animal is most infectious because the virus is in the saliva.21, 22, 25\n\n",

            "text": "It should not be a surprise that humans have a longstanding and deep-seated fear of diseases with animal origins, or as science calls them, zoonotic diseases. A majority of new diseases are zoonotic. For example, swine flu, West Nile virus, anthrax, severe acute respiratory syndrome, tuberculosis, influenza, Ebola, nipah, powassan, and plague represent diseases from a wide range of eras. It is not a far reach to realize that the collective conscience of the general public has been swayed and biased by diseases with animal origins.1 So, along with that understanding comes an almost guttural need to find ways to treat or cure those diseases. This is where some of the earliest misconceptions for treating rabies originate in our history. Let us examine some of those treatments that seem to perpetuate in time regardless of the modern advances in medicine.\u2022In many of the earliest recordings of the disease, the treatments centered on the wound. This makes sense when you consider that humans from early in history understood that the origin of rabies manifested in humans after a canid bite, often while the animal was drooling copious amounts of saliva (frothing at the mouth). Without listing every single early thought on treatment of these wounds, the common thread is to \u201cbleed and cauterize (burn) the wound.\u201d For example, in early traditional Indian medicine, there is acknowledgment of the fatality of hydrophobia (fear of water in rabies patients) and a prescription of treatment for it\u2014bleeding and cauterization of the wound. The process involved cauterizing the wound with clarified butter, which the patient is then asked to drink.1 It is accepted even today that after an animal bite, it is wise to let it bleed, followed by rigorous washing and flushing of the wound with soap and water. However, simply closing the wound or cauterizing it will not cure one from rabies.\u2022Interestingly, the very pathogenesis of rabies in how it takes the central nervous system hostage to spread its deadly virions is now being studied to treat and possibly cure disease in brain cancer patients. The rabies virus, which kills tens of thousands of people a year, has a rare ability to enter nerve cells and use them as a conduit to infect brain tissue. Now, scientists are trying to mimic this strategy to ferry tumor-killing nanoparticles into brain tumors. In laymen\u2019s terms, this means using viruses to carry tiny cancer killing agents to the tumor. So far, the approach has been shown to work only in mice. If successful in people, these nanoparticles could one day help doctors send treatment directly to tumors without harming healthy cells.26\n\u2022Alarmingly, homeopathic and neuropathic treatments have gained some traction in the world in a variety of applications for mild to deadly diseases. Rabies is not immune to these \u201ctreatments.\u201d While there is truth that some modern day medicines and drugs come from nature (e.g., penicillin is derived from the fungus Penicillium), in most instances it does not replace peer-reviewed and sound clinical trial-based medical treatments or procedures. Homeopathy principles roughly state that substances that produce similar symptoms of a particular ailment can cure said ailment (\u201clike cures like\u201d) and that diluting a substance increases its potency (\u201claw of infinitesimals\u201d), which brings to mind the \u201chair of the dog\u201d remedy for some hangover sufferers. Recently, there was a report in which diluted saliva from a rabid dog was used to \u201ctreat\u201d a 4-year-old boy for aggressive behavior. The first question that comes to mind is \u201cwhere did the United Kingdom homeopathic pharmacy obtain rabid dog saliva?\u201d Regardless, the rabid dog treatment, called lyssinum (aka lyssin or hydrophobinum), is one of more than 8500 homeopathic products approved by Health Canada. There is cause for concern, including those at the US Food and Drug Administration, that such homeopathic products can be harmful and/or delay actual medical interventions and treatments. The homeopath who administered the treatment admitted that \u201cthere is no common consensus about how the remedies work\u201d and continued to claim that it was effective and safe, plus added that the saliva was diluted to the point that it would not contain any trace of rabies virus. Most rabies experts would have concerns about this treatment.27\n\u2022In an earlier section of this chapter, it was mentioned that some individuals (including some in health care or other biological science majors or backgrounds) incorrectly believe that rabies treatment requires 20 or more shots into the stomach by some monstrously long needle. Actually, almost all modern treatment regimens for rabies include four key features:\u2022Generous cleaning and lavage of the bite wound with soap or topical antiseptic and warm water.\u2022Avoidance of wound repair. Closed bite wounds from dogs (or other animals) often become bacterially infected with early closure. The recommendation is to use very few sutures early and wait 7\u201314 days to more definitively close the wound.2 Additionally, tetanus immunization boosters are indicated.\u2022Human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) is essential for bridging immunity until the response to rabies vaccination occurs 10\u201314 days later. The HRIG is most effective when infiltrated in the wound and not intramuscularly (IM) remote from the bite wound.\u2022Rabies vaccine should be a modern cell-based, inactivated vaccine. Rabies vaccine is effective when given intradermally or IM, although only the latter route is licensed in the United States. The WHO recommends several schemata for rabies immunization. In the United States, only four doses (from the original five) are now recommended (0, 3, 7, and 14 days) because an immune response is invariably present by day 14.28 However, a fifth dose is still recommended on day 28 for individuals who are immunocompromised.2\n\n\n",
