            "text": "Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) cause a wide spectrum of diseases of the respiratory, ocular and gastrointestinal tracts. HAdVs are classified within the family Adenoviridae, genus Mastadenovirus, and are further divided into seven species (A\u2013G) and over 50 recognized types (Harrach et al., 2012). Clinical symptoms, disease severity and epidemiological patterns of infection are often determined by virus species or type. Species C HAdVs (serotypes 1, 2, 5 and 6) are globally endemic and infect most people early in life (Schmitz et al., 1983). Approximately half of all HAdVs identified in a three year study of clinically severe infections among U.S. civilians were species C (Gray et al., 2007). Uniquely, species C viruses can establish infections of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues where they can persist without clinical evidence for life (Garnett et al., 2002). Infections of immunocompetent persons with these viruses are most often subclinical or lead to mild acute respiratory illnesses. However, immunosuppressed persons are at risk for severe disseminate life-threatening disease from primary infection or virus reactivation (Ison, 2006, Walls et al., 2003, Echavarr\u00eda, 2008) as are immunologically naive newborns (Abzug and Levin, 1991, Cassir et al., 2014).",

            "text": "HAdVs were traditionally typed by neutralization and/or hemagglutination inhibition using type-specific hyperimmune animal antisera. A variety of molecular methods have since replaced immunotyping, including genome restriction analysis (Adrian et al., 1986), PCR-coupled microarrays (Lin et al., 2004); PCR-fragment length analysis (Adhikary et al., 2004, Ebner et al., 2006), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Blyn et al., 2008), partial sequencing of specific target genes (Lu and Erdman, 2006, McCarthy et al., 2009) and more recently, full genome sequencing using next generation molecular methods (Torres et al., 2010). However, these methods are often complex and time consuming, and are not optimally designed for viral load determinations, important for monitoring HAdV disease progression and therapeutic efficacy. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) has been proposed as a rapid, sensitive and widely available technology for detection and identification of HAdVs more suited for the clinical diagnostic setting (Heim et al., 2003, Metzgar et al., 2010). We recently introduced type-specific qPCR assays for identification HAdVs most often associated with outbreaks of acute respiratory disease (species B types 3, 7, 11, 14, 16 and 21; species E type 4) to facilitate rapid public health response (Lu et al., 2013). In this study, we describe the development and validation of qPCR assays for the endemic species C HAdVs.",

HAdV was detected in all samples and correctly identified to type by the respective qPCR assay. However, 2 different HAdV types were found in 10 clinical specimens [HAdV-1 (CT, 30.1)/-2 (CT, 31.8); HAdV-1 (CT, 29.0)/-5 (CT, 36.4); HAdV-2 (CT, 32.5)/-1 (CT, 40.4); HAdV-2 (CT, 34.0)/-5 (CT, 39.9); HAdV-2 (CT, 32.5)/-5 (CT, 38.3); HAdV-2 (CT, 35.2)/-5 (CT, 37.1); HAdV-5 (CT, 25.6)/-1 (CT, 32.9); HAdV-5 (CT, 35.3)/-1 (CT, 37.2); HAdV-5 (CT, 31.0)/-1 (CT, 38.0); HAdV-5 (CT, 19.2)/-1 (CT, 37.9)] and 3 HAdV types were found in one specimen [HAdV-2 (CT, 37.6)/-1 (CT, 40.0)/-5(CT, 40.2)]. All qPCR findings were confirmed by sequencing the respective qPCR amplicons. In most cases, only the predominant type (type with the lower CT value) was identified by our routine method of generic PCR and partial hexon gene sequencing (Lu and Erdman, 2005).",

In this study, we expanded this assay panel to include type-specific qPCR assays for the endemic species C viruses. Species C HAdVs can cause severe disseminate life-threatening disease in immunecompromised patients, particularly in the transplant recipients. Rapid and quantitative detection and identification of the endemic species C HAdVs among newborn and transplant recipients with severe disseminated diseases would help guide therapeutic intervention. Four species C HAdVs assays proved sensitive and specific and allowed quantitative assessment of viral loads based on standard curve analysis using quantified HPRs.",

(Kroes et al., 2007) has shown the sequential emergence of multiple HAdVs after pediatric stem cell transplantation making simultaneous detection of HAdVs coinfections especially challenging. Our type-specific qPCR assays will prove useful for type identification and management of mixed HAdV infections in immunocompromised persons and may facilitate future studies to better define the full complexity of HAdV infections in this population.",

Furthermore, since our qPCR assays target short sequences in the HAdV hexon gene, novel or hexon/fiber recombinant viruses would not be recognized.
