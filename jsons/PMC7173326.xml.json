In particular, emerging viral infections including the pandemic and avian influenza viruses, and the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, are associated with mortality rates ranging from 10\u201360% (Chan et al., 2015, Cheng et al., 2007, Cheng et al., 2012, To et al., 2013a). Early recognition and treatment of CAP improve outcome (Li et al., 2010, Musher and Thorner, 2014). The diagnosis of CAP depends on compatible symptoms and signs, together with new pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging (Musher and Thorner, 2014). However, distinguishing CAP from other pulmonary pathologies can be difficult (Wunderink and Waterer, 2014). Some patients with CAP may not have obvious respiratory symptoms. Non-CAP causes of pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph can mimic those due to CAP. Therefore, alternative modalities of diagnosing CAP are important.",

Using metabolomic analysis, we have previously identified 5 metabolites which could distinguish patients with bacteremia from those without bacteremia (To, et al., 2015). In a small study involving 11 children with severe pneumonia, plasma and urine metabolites were found to be significantly different from healthy community controls (Laiakis, et al., 2010). Plasma metabolites were able to discriminate between patients with tuberculosis and healthy controls (Frediani, et al., 2014). Urine metabolites were found to be different between patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and those with other causes of pneumonia (Slupsky, et al., 2009). Metabolic profiles may also predict the prognosis of patients with CAP (Seymour, et al., 2013).",

CAP cases were hospitalized adult patients 18 years or above with radiological evidence of consolidation within 48 hours of admission and at least one of the following symptoms (cough with or without sputum production, dyspnea, tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain) plus one auscultatory finding or one sign of infection (core body temperature >38 \u00b0C, shivers, leukocyte count >10,000 cells/\u03bcL or <4000 cells/\u03bcL (Muller, et al., 2010). Non-CAP controls were hospitalized adult patients not fulfilling the inclusion criteria for cases, and these included 3 subgroups: the non-infection subgroup consisted of patients without any clinical evidence of infection; the extrapulmonary infection subgroup consisted of patients with infection outside the respiratory tract; and the non-CAP respiratory tract infection subgroup consisted of patients with respiratory tract infections but without radiological evidence of pneumonia. Patients were excluded if they were aged <18 years or had radiological evidence of consolidation occurring >2 days after hospital admission, their clinical records were not accessible for review, or if archived plasma samples were not available. Clinical and microbiological data were retrieved from the Clinical Management System. Pneumonia Severity Index was used to assess the clinical severity (Fine, et al., 1997). Fisher\u2019s exact test and Student\u2019s t test were used in the comparison of categorical and continuous variables, respectively. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (HKU/HA HKW IRB; reference number UW 11-360).",

The changes in plasma lipid metabolite levels in CAP patients may be related to several reasons. Firstly, lipids make up 90% of surfactant, and disturbance in surfactant during pneumonia may cause changes in lipid metabolism (Wheelock, et al., 2013). Secondly, lipids are important inflammatory mediators during infection, and changes in lipid metabolites are observed during conditions such as sepsis, bacteremia, and viral infection (Cui et al., 2013, Langley et al., 2013, To et al., 2015). Thirdly, lipids are important in the structure and function of bacteria, and lipid metabolites are produced by bacteria (Kondakova et al., 2015, Lau et al., 2015). Therefore, in future studies for biomarker discovery, it would be worthwhile to optimize the extraction and detection steps for finding lipid metabolites.",

LysoPC(18:1[9Z]) had the highest sensitivity and specificity. The level of LysoPC(18:1[9Z]) was higher in CAP cases than in non-CAP controls, while the levels of LysoPEs were lower in CAP cases than in non-CAP controls. Our findings differ from patients with dengue virus infection, in which both serum LysoPC and LysoPE were reduced (Cui, et al., 2013). The high level of LysoPC in CAP patients can be related to specific host changes in pneumonia. High plasma levels of LysoPC in CAP patients may be caused by the release of LysoPC from surfactant during lung injury (Arbibe, et al., 1998). LysoPC may also contribute to direct toxicity to the lung (Grossmann et al., 1999, Vlaar et al., 2010, Zhou et al., 2014). However, a previous study showed that the plasma levels of LysoPC were lower among fatal than non-fatal patients, and low levels of LysoPC was postulated to be associated with dysregulated inflammatory response (Cho, et al., 2015). In our study, the plasma levels of LysoPC were significantly lower in high-risk CAP cases, and were also lower in fatal CAP cases than those of non-fatal CAP cases, although not reaching statistical significance (Table 3). The lack of statistical significance may be related to the relative small number of fatal cases in our cohort. Further studies are needed to assess whether LysoPC is a favorable prognostic factor.",

In a mouse peritonitis model, LysoPE has been shown to increase the level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, and reduces plasma leakage (Hung, et al., 2011). The levels of 4 LysoPEs were significantly lower in the fatal CAP cases than the non-fatal CAP cases. Therefore, a higher LysoPE level in CAP may improve survival via the amelioration of excessive inflammation.",

            "text": "In this study, the levels of 5 sphingolipids were higher in the CAP cases than in the non-CAP controls. Sphingolipids are associated with many pulmonary diseases (Uhlig and Gulbins, 2008). Sphingolipids are critical in the structure and function of the plasma membrane, and are involved in many cellular processes. Lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide and tetrahexosylceramide are metabolites from ceramide (Fig. 2\n), and ceramide are important in regulating immune cell trafficking and the vascular and epithelial integrity (Maceyka and Spiegel, 2014). For example, lactosylceramide is a mediator of inflammatory response triggered by Pneumocystis (Evans, et al., 2012). In vitro, influenza virus infection induces elevated levels of hexosylceramides(Tanner, et al., 2014). Inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis has been associated with reduced pulmonary inflammation in mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Dechecchi, et al., 2011). Sphingomyelin is a structural component of cell membranes (Maceyka and Spiegel, 2014). In mice, sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2), which catalyzes the synthesis of sphingomyelin, is activated during LPS-induced lung injury, and inhibition of SMS2 attenuated lung injury and endothelial barrier disruption (Anjum, et al., 2012). This mice study suggested that sphingomyelin is important in lung injury, and the higher level of sphingomyelins in our CAP cases is compatible with this hypothesis. However, other studies suggest that high levels of sphingomyelin may be protective. Stringer et al showed that patients with acute lung injury had lower levels of sphingomyelin when compared to healthy controls, although the absolute difference is small (Stringer, et al., 2011).",

Ceramide is converted to glucosylceramide, which is then converted to lactosylceramide. Phosphatidic acid is converted to diacylglyerol, which is then converted to phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine.

Serial monitoring of these metabolites may help to assess the disease progress. Secondly, we did not analyze the relationship between the specific pathogens and each metabolite because of the limited number of patients infected by each pathogen. Thirdly, a higher proportion of CAP cases had underlying chronic lung disease than non-CAP controls. Previous studies showed that the levels of plasma or serum metabolites are different between patients with chronic lung diseases and healthy controls. When compared with healthy controls, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had higher levels of glycerophophocholine but lower levels of lipoprotein and amino acids, while patients with asthma had higher levels of taurine, lathosterol, bile acids, nicotinamide and adenosine-5-phosphate than healthy controls (Comhair et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2013). Further studies are required to determine whether the levels of the metabolites identified in this study are different between patients with chronic underlying diseases and healthy controls. Fourthly, in our cohort, there were no patients with non-infective etiologies which can lead to pulmonary infiltrates, such as interstitial lung disease. Further studies should include patients with non-infective pulmonary disease without evidence of infection.",
