This is due to limited testing which biased towards the serious cases. The number of documented fatalities on the other hand is likely to be much closer to the actual number. In this note we use a method to estimate the actual number of infections from the documented number of fatalities. This estimate is one of our main results. It is important because it is seems possible that asymptomatic and sub-clinical infections may also infect others [1] . We find large uncertainties in these predictions at this time, and suggest a method to improve the estimates systematically day by day. This gives us a secondary motivation, which is to refine epidemiological parameters for COVID-19 infections using only the daily statistics of fatalities.",

We use statistical models for the progression of the disease from asymptomatic to resolution into recovery or fatality which are parametrized to fit reports. We also need the infection fatality ratio (IFR), which we take from previous studies. Using these we make predictions for the infected population now and in future for various scenarios for the exponential growth rate.

In comparison, the aggregated data on fatalities in India taken until 30 March, indicates a doubling time of roughly 4 days. We note that between March 30 and April 2, the number of fatalities in the Mumbai-Navi Mumbai-Pune area changed from 8 to 14, which supports the idea that Scenario B may not be far from the current doubling time in this location. The aggregated Indian fatality numbers could either be dominated by rapid growth in some local outbreaks, or a general spread of the disease.

The interval from onset of symptoms to release from hospital for a recovery may depend on various factors. It is seen to be larger from the time to death. This latter number is seen to have a mean of 17.8 days [8] , and is the one relevant for our analysis. We will take the duration of the disease, T , to be the sum of these two periods, i.e., T = t i + t r . We will take the incubation period to be a minimum of 3 days and have an exponential distribution after that, so that the mean incubation period is 5.1 days. We shall take the recovery time to have a minimum of 12 days, and be exponentially distributed such that the mean time to death is 17.8 days.

Note that the very broad and skewed distributions of T and IFR will give similarly broad and skewed distributions of I(t). Here we suggest how to narrow these estimates progressively. Any knowledge of I(t) gives a prediction of I(t \u2032 ) at a future date t \u2032 . Uncertainties in I(t) expand into larger uncertainties in I(t \u2032 ) due to exponential growth. However, the number of fatalities up to date t \u2032 , i.e.. D(t \u2032 ), is directly observable. A time series for D(t \u2032 ) allows us to estimate \u03c4 directly. Furthermore, with each day's data on fatalities, one can run the evolution backwards to rule out some of the uncertainty in the starting prediction I(t) on 30 March. This means that the prediction for D(t \u2032 ) = I(t \u2032 ) \u00d7 IFR further in the future is narrowed down. We show this inference procedure schematically in Figure 1 .

Our predictions are exhibited in Table I . Note that the 95% CL spans an enormous range, due to the spread in the input parameters, mainly the time interval between infection and death. Note that the distribution of I(t) is very skew, and the median is close to the lower end of the 95% CL. In Scenario B, the upper end of the 95% CL is more than 1% of the population of Mumbai. We consider this highly unlikely, although statistically possible. We have outlined a procedure refine these estimates by incorporating daily data progressively into the computation.",

In fact [8] simultaneously reports IFR and the fraction of infected individuals who are hospitalized, H. This ratio, averaged over the population is reported to be in the range H = 2-4%. In Scenario B, therefore one may expect 440-12,000 people to arrive in a hospital. Even among these, some may not be able to consult a physician during a lock-down. Nevertheless, current experience strongly disfavours the upper end of this 95% CL range. One recalls again, that the median is close to the lower end.

This also means that the current policy for testing is likely to be catching most cases which need to be hospitalized. One hopes that with the decision to administer the faster serum test, it might become possible to sample the larger population more effectively. Finally we point out that there is a strong age structure to all the model parameters, which we have ignored. This we plan to do in future. Along with the planned Bayesian narrowing of the parameter space of COVID-19 pathology and epidemiology, this would provide valuable inputs for more detailed models which can be used to inform future policy.",

The projected number of fatalities, D, provides observational tests of the model. Note that the distributions are very skewed and that the median lies close to the lower limit of the very large 95% CL. The 95% CL prediction for fatality counts D = I \u00d7 IFR on 10 April for different values of \u03c4 are shown as the vertical lines. The continuous line joins the medians of these distributions.
