A few reports of use of mesenchymal stromal / stem cell in the treatment of COVID 19 has emerged in recent times with promising results. 15 Wilson et al conducted a study to investigate the effectiveness and safety of the use of mesenchymal stem cells for ARDS with favourable results . 16 MSCs are non-immunogenic due to their low expression of Major histocompatibility Complex (MHC). This makes it well suited for therapeutic interventions using allogenic transfers without HLA matching. 17 In the presence of an exaggerated immune response, as seen in COVID 19 patients with cytokine storm and ARDS, the pro-inflammatory cytokines bring out an anti-inflammatory effect on the MSCs. The MSCs secrete several soluble factors such as Nitric oxide (NO) , Transforming growth factor (TGF) beta , Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) , HLA -G5 and soluble interleukin 6 . These molecules then inhibit the proliferation and activation of TH1 and TH17 cell lines, thereby decreasing the production of interferon-gamma and interleukin 17.
