Methods: RT-qPCR assays and molecular sequencing methods were used to identify HRV and HEV strains in nasopharyngeal aspirates of 309 hospitalized pediatric patients with microbiologically unexplained ARTIs and in 210 hospitalized pediatric patients without respiratory symptoms from September 2009 to June 2010 in France. Results: Among the 309 ARTI cases, 15 HEV and 172 HRV strains were identified whereas only 1 HEV and 37 HRV strains were observed in control patients (187 vs. 38: P < 10 \u00c03 ). HRV strains were identified in 150 of the 164 lower ARTIs whereas HEV strains were identified in only 14 of these cases. Among bronchiolitis and asthma exacerbation cases (n Z 133), HEV infected cases were older (Median age (months) 36 vs. 11, P Z 0.003) and were more frequently associated with a respiratory distress (P Z 0.01) and a need for oxygen supply at the time of admission (P Z 0.01) than cases infected by HRV strains.

Because of a large EV genetic diversity combined with the continuous discovery of new species and new serotypes, the EV molecular detection by in-house or commercially available RT-PCR assays could fail and lead to an underestimation of the etiological and clinical role of HRV and HEV strains in pediatric ARTIs. 4 Moreover, genotyping by capsid proteins coding region sequencing and phylogenetic analyses are presently required to distinguish between HEV and HRV respiratory infections. 4 In the present time, it remains to assess the respective pathogenicity of respiratory HEV and HRV strains in pediatric patients, to identify genotypes or species specifically involved in upper and lower human respiratory diseases and to understand the epidemiology and the molecular mechanisms responsible for emergence of EV epidemic strains. 4 In the present study, we retrospectively detected HEV and HRV strains in the respiratory tract of pediatric patients hospitalized for microbiologically unexplained ARTIs by use of a generic \"Pan-entero-rhino\" one-step RT-qPCR assay that was previously designed to overcome the genetic diversity of both HRV and HEV circulating in humans. 22 Viruses belonging to the EV genus were detected in 60.5% of the NPAs and were identified as the potential etiological cause of ARTI in these hospitalized patients. These pediatric patients had been identified as negative for the classical detection of common bacterial and virological respiratory pathogens known as major etiological causes of bronchiolitis or asthma exacerbation in the Northern east of France. 5, 33 In the present study, we did not test our samples for the presence of Human Metapneumoviruses and Human Coronaviruses because these viral agents had been previously identified as potential etiological agents in less than 10% of bronchiolitis and asthma exacerbation cases hospitalized in Northern of France. 33 Interestingly, EVs were only detected in 18.1% of the children hospitalized during the same period without clinical respiratory symptoms consistent with ARTIs. The differential of EV detection levels between our patient and control groups strongly supported the importance of HRV and HEV strains as major etiological agents in the development of ARTIs in hospitalized pediatric patients. 2, 5, 9 Moreover, we observed high EV load levels in cases of ARTIs supporting the hypothesis of an EV ongoing replication instead of an EV viral shedding in the respiratory tract of study patients with respiratory symptoms (Table 1) . However, viral load levels appeared to be similar between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients suggesting that the clinical symptoms observed were more likely due to inter-individual susceptibility factors to the EV infection rather than to EV determinants of virulence. The interindividual factors leading to the development of symptomatic EV infections in humans remained to be determined and could be related to the induction of a local efficient antiviral immune response in the human respiratory tract. 34 Distinction between HEV and HRV in pediatric ARTIs revealed the predominance of HRV infections. 4, 35 Indeed, only 15 HEV infections have been evidenced in comparison with the 172 HRV infections detected in our 309 pediatric ARTI cases. In our study, all successfully typed HEV strains (10/15) were HEV-D68. This recently emerging virus was isolated from respiratory specimens for the first time in 1962 in the U.S. in children with pneumonia and bronchiolitis. 36 However, until recently, reports of respiratory infections due to HEV-D68 were rare. 37 Over the past three years, outbreaks in Japan, the Philippines and the Netherlands as well as epidemic clusters in the United Kingdom have implicated HEV-D68 as an emerging respiratory pathogen. 12e14, 18 In the present study, HEV-D68 strains were responsible for a low proportion of pediatric cases hospitalized for ARTIs. Our findings provide further insights into the potential specific lower respiratory tract tropism of HEV-D68 and increase our awareness of the clinical role of these strains. Among our genotyped HRV strains, the HRV-C species appeared to be the leading cause of infection far ahead of HRV-A and B species. However in the present work, the high number of untypable HRV strains highlighted the difficulty to amplify and sequence viral capsid gene RNA sequences extracted from clinical respiratory samples.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 316, "end": 319, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 320, "end": 322, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 876, "end": 877, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1052, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1397, "end": 1398, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1737, "end": 1739, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2153, "end": 2155, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2156, "end": 2158, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2467, "end": 2469, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2858, "end": 2860, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2861, "end": 2863, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2864, "end": 2865, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3603, "end": 3605, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3702, "end": 3704, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3705, "end": 3707, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 4068, "end": 4070, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 4156, "end": 4158, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 4361, "end": 4363, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3082, "end": 3091, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Clinical severity between HEV and HRV infections was compared among bronchiolitis and asthma exacerbation cases that were the most frequent lower ARTIs reported in our study.

Taking into account all these results, HEV respiratory strains might be more pathogenic and virulent than HRV strains. Moreover, we did not evidence a higher pathogenicity of HRV-C in comparison to HRV-A/B in lower respiratory tract illnesses as reported in recent publications 6e8 : this could be linked to the high proportion of untyped HRV strains in the present study (Fig. 1) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1000, "end": 1009, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1112, "end": 1121, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1276, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1651, "end": 1659, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the present retrospective study, we observed that 86 of the 187 HRV or HEV positive pediatric patients with ARTIs received antibiotics whereas only 7 of them had developed a bacterial superinfection that had been evidenced (S. pneumoniae (n Z 2), H. influenzae (n Z 4) and Branhamella catarrhalis (n Z 1)) during the course of hospitalization. This suggested that the severity and duration of HRV or HEV respiratory symptoms could have been responsible for an inadequate and probabilistic prescription of antibiotics by the pediatricians. These findings highlighted the potential interest to routinely perform an RT-PCR assay allowing a rapid EV detection in NPAs samples taken from pediatric patients hospitalized for ARTIs. Moreover it could be interesting to implement the most popular commercially available multiplex respiratory virus assays like the RVP and FilmArray by adding a specific HEV molecular identification using specific probes. 38 Indeed, such implemented multiplex RT-PCR assays might allow to reinforce clinical monitoring of HEV positive children and to discontinue antibiotic treatments in case of a positive EV etiological identification.

denaturation at 94 C for 15 s and annealing/extension step at 63 C for 1 min. At the end of the extension step, the Step-One-Plus Real-time PCR Detection system (Applied Biosystem, Saint Aubin, France) monitored real-time PCR amplification by quantitative analysis of the fluorescence emissions. The copy number of viral RNA was determined based on a standard curve of C (t) level versus the copy number of positive-strand transcripts of the CVB3 genome transcribed from pCR21C10A cDNA clone kindly provided by N.M. Chapman (University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha NE USA).
