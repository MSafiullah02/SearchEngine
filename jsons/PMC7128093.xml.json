Following NT swabs, blood samples were sent for acute viral serology (influenza A or B and adenovirus) using the complement fixation assay, cytomegalovirus polymerase chain reaction (CMV PCR) analysis, full blood count, biochemistry and immunosuppressant levels. Detailed pulmonary function tests, a chest radiograph and measurement of oxygen saturation were also performed. Selected patients with significant LRT symptoms and/or radiographic infiltrates proceeded to early fiber-optic bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy (TBB). BAL samples were not processed for viral studies and IFA test results were available within 24 hours of collection. Convalescent serology for respiratory viruses was collected 6 weeks after clinical presentation and lung function charted for 6 months post-infection. Baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was defined as the average of 2 measurements recorded in the 4 months preceding clinical presentation separated by at least 4 weeks. Diagnosis of RVI required a positive viral culture, IFA test or demonstration of a 4-fold rise in serum antibody titer. Study participants received similar immunosuppressive therapy early post-transplantation consisting of oral cyclosporine, azathioprine and prednisolone (maintenance dose on .20 mg/kg). Acute rejection was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone 15 mg/kg per day for 3 days and generally followed by an oral taper commencing at 1 mg/kg. Patients were switched from cyclosporine to tacrolimus 0.15 mg/kg for recurrent or persistent rejection.",

A second swab was used to vigorously rub the posterior oropharynx. Each swab was placed in 2 ml of viral transport medium9 and transported immediately to an outside reference laboratory 5 km from our institution. Upon arrival, the liquid medium from each swab was mixed together and centrifuged to provide a cellular supernatant. Only specimens with at least 3 epithelial cells per 400\u00d7 field under light microscopy were considered adequate for viral detection. Half of the cells were removed with a Pasteur pipette and placed onto 8-well slides. The IFA test consisted of two immunologic reagents. First, 20 \u03bcl of each anti-viral mouse monoclonal antibody to adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B and parainfluenza 1\u20133 were inoculated with the wells. Then 20 \u03bcl of non-immune mouse antibody was added to the final well as a negative control. Specimens were incubated in a humid chamber at 35\u00b0 to 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated with fluorescein-isothiocyanate was added and then washed to remove any unattached reagent. The antigen wells were examined at 400\u00d7 magnification with the non-immune mouse well examined first to detect any non-specific background immunofluorescence. Cells infected with virus displayed apple-green fluorescence that was cytoplasmic and/or nuclear, in a uniform or punctate distribution. The remaining cells with supernatant from the NT swab were processed for culture isolation and incubated with MDCK cells at 35\u00b0 to 37\u00b0C. Cells were observed daily for cytopathic changes of vacuolation and stained for respiratory virus after 4 to 7-day incubation as outlined earlier.4\n",

Infection peaked in September, which corresponds to early spring in Australia, and was observed predominately in patients >2 years post-transplantation. Table I\nhighlights the method of diagnosis in influenza patients according to symptom duration at presentation. Seven influenza patients were tested within 1 week of clinical symptoms, with the IFA component of the diagnostic test detecting 6 cases (sensitivity 86%). The 1 case missed on IFA was subsequently detected on viral culture assay. However, 3 of the 6 IFA-positive cases were culture negative, giving a sensitivity of culture in this patient sub-group of only 56%. Two patients with delayed clinical presentation beyond 1 week had negative NT swabs and were diagnosed on the basis of serologic conversion.

No patient had received augmented immunosuppression or anti-rejection treatment before the diagnosis. All subjects, except 1, experienced significant morbidity from infection with LRT symptoms, acute decline in lung function and/or a requirement for hospital admission. Bacterial co-infection was documented on sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples in 5 of 9 patients, with 7 receiving intravenous antibiotics. Most patients also received anti-inflammatory doses of oral prednisolone commencing at 1 mg/kg tapering by 5 mg/day to their usual maintenance dose. However, a steroid pulse was not given to the patient with symptoms limited to the upper respiratory tract with normal graft function or the patient with significant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. Anti-viral therapy with amantadine or selective neuraminidase inhibitors was not administered to study participants. TBB was performed in 3 patients with radiologic infiltrates and revealed intense airway-centered inflammation with neutrophils in 2 cases.

Palmer and colleagues5 described 10 episodes of RVI in 122 adult lung transplant patients over a 5-year review, with not a single case of influenza identified. Holt et al11 reported 1,820 lavage samples in 137 lung or heart\u2013lung recipients over a 7-year period with influenza isolated only twice. At the Duke University Medical Center, Matar and colleagues2 diagnosed just 2 subjects with influenza over 5 years on lavage samples taken from 176 lung transplant patients. These retrospective reviews incorporated both surveillance and diagnostic biopsy protocols, with BAL fluid the diagnostic specimen. They contrast significantly with prospective evaluations performed in immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies before and after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) using upper respiratory tract sampling techniques. Ljungman et al12 reported that 19% of such patients (15 of 78) had a respiratory virus detectable on nasal wash during a 3-month study period with the vast majority of patients symptomatic. A large prospective study post-BMT, comparing isolation sites for confirmed influenza A infection, showed that only 6% of lavage samples vs 94% of nasal wash/throat swab specimens were DFA- or culture-positive for virus.13 We report 9 cases of influenza infection over a 3-month period in 18 lung transplant recipients with \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms, from a transplant community of some 115. Several additional factors may explain our higher prevalence of infection such as seasonal and geographic variation along with heightened efforts to diagnose infection. Nonetheless, the incidence of influenza infection in adult lung transplant recipients is likely to be considerably greater than that reported to date, with the more specific application of diagnostic tests obtained from the upper respiratory tract.",

Garantziotis et al14 reported similar findings with lavage fluid in their small series of 3 cases of influenza pneumonia in lung transplant recipients. Our lower rate of positive viral culture may reflect in vitro viral instability or sub-optimal specimen handling. Although all samples were sent to an outside reference laboratory, inoculation into cell culture and IFA staining was achieved within a few hours. No sample was frozen in transport, which may otherwise promote cellular degradation and reduce viral stability. If we exclude patients with clinical presentation beyond 1 week, the sensitivity of IFA improves significantly to 86%.

Radiographic anomalies were not predictive of more severe graft dysfunction or development of respiratory failure. No patient required ventilatory support or died as a result of their acute infection. To our knowledge, no anti-viral agents have proven efficacy against influenza infection in transplant recipients. Inhaled zanamivir and oral oseltamivir are selective inhibitors of the neuraminidase glycoprotein essential for replication of influenza A and B viruses. Studies in immunocompetent volunteers have shown that these agents reduce the duration of disease (by up to 1.5 days), severity of illness and secondary complications compared with placebo when initiated within 36 hours of symptom onset.16, 17 IFA testing may facilitate the broader application of these novel agents in transplant recipients by rapid confirmation of infection. Although we have described influenza as generally self-limiting in the acute setting, strategies to reduce morbidity may prove cost-effective. Further research is needed to define potential sub-groups of transplant recipients who may benefit from early introduction of neuraminidase inhibitors.",

This poor response is similar to that achieved after influenza vaccination in patients after thoracic organ transplantation, where protective antibody levels have been seen in 36% to 41% of recipients.18, 19 The major public health measure for the prevention of influenza infection remains the use of inactivated vaccine administered in autumn each year. Nonetheless, vaccination of lung transplant recipients with a yearly single-dose influenza vaccine may afford minimal protection against viral replication and infection. All except 1 patient was vaccinated for influenza some 4 months prior to the evaluation period. This adds further controversy to the debate regarding the need for booster vaccination and serologic confirmation of antibody response. However, it is feasible that vaccination of our patient group protected individuals from more severe clinical manifestations by inducing low serum levels of protective antibody. Until specific assays to measure antibodies to vaccine constituents become more widely available, we continue to recommend at least the single-dose influenza vaccine.",

            "text": "Retrospective clinical reviews support an association between RVI and the development of BOS.5 Seasonal clustering of onset of BOS suggests that infectious triggers such as respiratory viruses may play an etiologic role.20 Obliterative bronchiolitis has recently been described shortly after influenza pneumonia in both pediatric and adult lung transplant recipients.14, 21 Experimentally, the intratracheal instillation of parainfluenza 1 in rat lung allografts induces the typical lesion of obliterative bronchiolitis within 56 days on histologic section.22 Palmer5 described 4 of 8 patients developing BOS immediately following RVI or several months after infection. In our study, patients experienced a similar reversible decline in lung function with no progression to BOS or worsening BOS grade on follow-up. However, BOS Grade 3 patients with influenza failed to return to baseline and experienced ongoing loss thereafter. This suggests that patients with severe pre-existing bronchiolar epithelial damage have a limited repertoire of defense mechanisms to respiratory viruses.22 A component of the pathology in influenza is caused by recruitment of T cells to the site of infection.23 Perhaps the use of oral prednisolone in treatment regimens for lower BOS grades protected the patients from initiation or amplification of the chronic rejection process. Mechanisms of action of this steroid blockade may include downregulation of lymphocyte alloreactivity or minimization of the sub-epithelial inflammatory reaction. In addition, acute rejection was an infrequent association with influenza infection, with only 1 biopsy-proven Grade A3 rejection on Day 5 of hospitalization.",

Although our study population was relatively small, we believe IFA testing of NT swabs is a low-cost less invasive test of high sensitivity in the diagnosis of infection. Routine viral culture of NT swabs may not be necessary after an initial positive IFA, given its lower sensitivity in our experience. With early diagnosis and institution of intensive supportive treatment, infection is generally self-limiting, showing an infrequent association with acute rejection. With the exception of BOS Grade 3 patients, we found no association with the subsequent development of BOS in 6 months of follow-up. Although we recommend an annual influenza vaccination, single-dose protocols may provide only minimal protection against disease.",
