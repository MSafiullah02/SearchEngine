Pain may be related to the skin as a single organ system and in certain cases may be so severe that it becomes difficult to evaluate whether or not other organs are involved, for example, involvement of the ventral abdomen may cause the animal to walk with a stiff gait or avoid lying down. It may also be challenging to palpate the abdomen or perform a routine abdominal ultrasound, even under sedation, when the skin of the abdomen is severely affected and painful. Dogs with a thick hair coat may only show signs of severe pain when touched or handled and the lesions may not become evident to the owners or clinician until the skin itself is more thoroughly examined.

Morris, personal communication, 2012). Tetracycline has recently become unavailable in the United States, and doxycycline may be substituted for it at a dosage of 5 to 10 mg/kg every 12 hours.

A number of underlying factors may be associated with vasculitides in dogs and cats, including drugs, infectious diseases, adverse reactions to food, malignancies, and immune-mediated diseases. Vasculitis should thus be regarded as a reaction pattern that warrants an extensive workup of the patient to identify such triggers. Affected patients present with a variety of symptoms, such as purpura, pitting edema, and ulcerations of the skin. Constitutional signs such as fever, depression, and anorexia are common and seem to be present in the majority of patients. Once a diagnosis is confirmed by compatible histologic findings, treatment, and follow-up must be tailored to the individual patient. High doses of immunosuppressive medications are only recommended once infectious diseases capable of producing a similar constellation of clinical signs have been ruled out.",
