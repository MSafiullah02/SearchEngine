Quarantine is separation of persons who have been exposed to an infection but asymptomatic, while isolation is separation of infected patients. Voluntary quarantine is preferred, but if necessary, it can be mandatory. These implementations can lead to restrictions on individual liberties, leading to ethical and legal problems. Isolation and quarantine enforcement are regulated by laws. Those who do not follow the quarantine rules could be punished. Isolation and quarantine practices in our country are described in General Hygiene Law. In this study the importance of quarantine, when and how it is applied, and its ethical and especially legal dimension are discussed.",

Quarantine is one of the most effective public health measures for controlling outbreaks. It means \"separation and restriction of the movement of people who are exposed to a contagious disease\" as stated by Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) [1] .The aim of the quarantine is to monitor the exposed person for the development of symptoms and to prevent the possible transmission of the pathogen from the asymptomatic person to others. Quarantine may be voluntary or mandatory, voluntary quarantine is preferred. During the quarantine, the individual must remain in his home or in a place designated for this task and follow the rules. It may be applied to an individual or a community and must continue until the longest incubation period of the pathogen [2] . In some articles, \"precautionary self-isolation of contacts\" is used instead of quarantine [3] . Isolation means \"separation of sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick\". The aim of this measure is to prevent or minimize person-to-person transmission of disease. Although the quarantine and isolation definitions are different, these two terms can often be used one for the other. Briefly, while quarantine is applied to asymptomatic patients, isolation is applied to symptomatic patients. If the person becomes symptomatic during the quarantine period, isolation should be started. [1, 4, 5] .",

In order to prevent the coastal cities from being affected by the plague epidemic, ships arriving in Venice were kept in the harbor for 40 days, then they could approach the shore. The term quarantine was derived from Italian word quaranta that means forty [1, 7, 8] . Then islands in Italy were used quarantine stations for controlling the plague and leprosy during the epidemics [9] . After the yellow fever and cholera epidemics in the late 1800s, quarantine laws were passed for the first time in America [10] . Quarantine is also an important component to fight influenza outbreaks. During the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918-1919, isolation and quarantine measures were widely used to prevent transmission [1] .",

If the rules are not followed during the application especially during the restrictions imposed on many people, such as quarantine practice in the hospital, some risks may arise.

The same risk exists in quarantine applications for diseases that are at risk of transmission begin before symptoms. Moreover, difficulties may arise during the cohort of those with and without signs of infection. Patients admitted to the hospital with other diseases and conditions, is another problem. Apart from the risk of transmission of the contagious agent to these patients, it is an important issue that they do not receive adequate service regarding their actual diseases.

According to the federal law in United States (US), quarantine and isolation can be applied for some infectious diseases including cholera, plague, smallpox, diphtheria, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and pandemic flu for the benefit of society. Responsibility for the efforts to prevent infectious diseases to entering and spreading into the country is given to the CDC. If necessary, the CDC may decide to isolation or quarantine. There are federal and local laws regulating isolation and quarantine enforcement. Sometimes police forces may be needed to enforce these rules. Those who do not follow the quarantine rules can be punished. Individuals can be released from quarantine with the permit of Federal laws [1]. In a study evaluating quarantine and isolation laws in 50 states of US; it stated that only 10 states have minor changes in their isolation and quarantine rules after 2014-2016 Ebola outbreaks. In remaining states, quarantine rules have not been changed for a long time. It was observed in this study that there were considerable differences between the states in terms of quarantine and isolation rules. In 51% of states, the use of police forces was permitted, if necessary, to protect the public's health. In 45% of the states, financial support was planned and provided for the safe and humane quarantine process. Only 20% had protective rules to prevent the individual in quarantine from losing their job [24] .",
