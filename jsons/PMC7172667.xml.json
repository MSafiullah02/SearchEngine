Apart from the theoretical advantage of RT in eliminating local micro-metastases, practice shows that a real multimodal approach is probably applied for patients choosing RP, whereas patients choosing RT first rarely receive salvage RP.

Furthermore, the decision on whether or not to perform extended nodal dissection in the current scenario could be debatable given the lack of certain oncologic benefit and the possible role of prostate-specific membrane antigen\u2013based positron emission tomography for preoperative nodal staging [5]. Currently, pelvic nodal dissection is the major driver of postoperative complications, carrying a 10% risk of symptomatic lymphocele [5]. Complications may lead to a delay in adjuvant treatment and, at worst, leave the patient prone to postoperative infection due to bacterial or viral transmission.",
