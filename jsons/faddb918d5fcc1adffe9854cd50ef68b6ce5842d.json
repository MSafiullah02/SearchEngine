            "text": "The chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has become a substantial global health threat due to its massive reemergence, the considerable disease burden and the lack of vaccines or therapeutics. We discovered a novel class of small molecules ([1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-7(6H)-ones) with potent in vitro activity against CHIKV isolates from different geographical regions. Drug-resistant variants were selected and these carried a P34S substitution in non-structural protein 1 (nsP1), the main enzyme involved in alphavirus RNA capping. Biochemical assays using nsP1 of the related Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus revealed that the compounds specifically inhibit the guanylylation of nsP1. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report demonstrating that the alphavirus capping machinery is an excellent antiviral drug target. Considering the lack of options to treat CHIKV infections, this series of compounds with their unique (alphavirus-specific) target offers promise for the development of therapy for CHIKV infections.",

Combining the ethyl substituent at position 5 of the heterocyclic base in MADTP-372 and the 3\u2032-acetyl group at the aryl moiety present in the initial hit (MADTP-314) led to the synthesis of MADTP-393 (the synthesis of this molecule will be published elsewhere). This MADTP analog had a better anti-CHIKV profile than MADTP-314, but was not as potent as MADTP-372 (Table 1) . MADTP-346 is a close structural analog that was devoid of anti-CHIKV activity.",

Time-of-addition studies revealed that MADTP-314 had an inhibition profile that was comparable to that of a polymerase-targeting compound (T-705 12 ), i.e. the compound remained active when addition to the infected cultures was delayed by several hours (up to 6 h) post infection (1.3 log 10 and 1.0 log 10 reduction in CHIKV RNA for MADTP-314 and T-705, respectively, when added 6h post infection and assessed at 24 h post infection). In contrast, chloroquine, a CHIKV entry inhibitor included as a reference compound, entirely lost its protective activity when added at time points later than 1 h p.i., whereas a 2 log 10 reduction of CHIKV RNA was obtained when the compound was added 2 h before infection. To study whether MADTP-314 can block CHIKV cell entry, CHIKV pseudoparticles (CHIKVpp) were produced as described before 15 . These pseudoparticles are lentiviral vectors carrying CHIKV glycoproteins and are thus ideally suited to study CHIKV entry independently from post entry steps in the viral life cycle. In line with the time-of-addition experiments, MADTP-314 and analogs were not able to block the entry of CHIKV pseudoparticles (CHIKVpp) into the host cell (Fig. 2a) . In contrast, CHIKV entry inhibitors such as arbidol and chloroquine inhibited CHIKVpp entry in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 2a) 9, 16 . To assess whether MADTP-314 (directly) affects translation of incoming capped CHIKV RNA genomes, cells were transfected with a replication-deficient CHIKV RNA (carrying an active site mutation in the RNA polymerase domain of nsP4) encoding an nsP3-luciferase fusion protein, which allowed measuring translation independent of RNA replication. Luciferase activity in cells treated with 250 \u03bcM MADTP-314 was comparable to that in untreated control cells, suggesting that the compound did not directly inhibit translation of the incoming, capped genomic RNA (Fig. 2b ). Next we assessed whether MADTP-314 had a direct inhibitory effect on CHIKV RNA synthesis as quantified by measuring 3 H-uridine incorporation into newly synthesized CHIKV RNA. In CHIKV-infected cells, MADTP-314 (50-250 \u03bcM) did not inhibit CHIKV RNA synthesis (Fig. 2c) . This was confirmed in an in vitro assay with isolated replication/transcription complexes (RTCs) 17 , which demonstrated that 250 \u03bcM of MADTP-314 did not inhibit the incorporation of 32 P-CTP into CHIKV RNA (Fig. 2d) . Taken together these results demonstrate that MADTP-314 inhibits CHIKV replication at a post-entry step, other than translation or viral RNA synthesis.",

Interestingly, P34 is located near a conserved histidine at position 37 in a region of nsP1 known to contain several key residues for the mRNA capping functions (Supplemental Figure 1A ,B) 18 . Involvement of the P34S substitution in the MADTP-resistant phenotype. The mutation that causes the P34S substitution in nsP1 was introduced into infectious clone CHIKV LS3 19 by reverse genetics. Serial passaging on Vero E6 cells in the absence of MADTP and sequencing of the virus revealed that the mutation was stable for at least 5 passages and did not markedly affect viral fitness. Indeed plaque morphologies of CHIKV-LS3-nsP1-P34S and WT CHIKV-LS3 were comparable (Fig. 3a ) and the P34S mutant replicated only slightly slower than WT in growth curve experiments (Fig. 3b) . Western blot analysis of CHIKV-infected Vero E6 cells at various time points p.i. indicated that the accumulation of nsP1 in cells infected with the P34S mutant virus was somewhat reduced compared to WT (Fig. 3c) . The P34S mutation thus seems to only modestly affect the growth characteristics of the virus.",

In contrast to the WT virus, the reverse-engineered mutant nsP1-P34S virus proved to be highly resistant to the antiviral effect of the three different MADTP compounds [it should be noted that CHIKV strain LS3 was 1.5-fold less sensitive to MADTP-314 than CHIKV 899]. By analyzing CHIKV protein expression in infected cells, the nsP1-P43S mutant virus was also shown to be highly resistant to MADTP-314, as nsP1 and E2E3 proteins were easily detected in cells treated with MADTP-314 concentrations above 63 \u03bcM, whereas such treatment resulted in hardly detectable expression of CHIKV proteins in cells infected with the WT virus (Fig. 4 ). In conclusion, these results clearly linked the nsP1-P34S mutation to phenotypic resistance to MADTP compounds.",

The protein catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to the N7 position of a GTP molecule, which is followed by the formation of an m 7 GMP-nsP1 adduct. The subsequent transfer of m 7 GMP onto the 5\u2032 end of the viral RNA has been recently demonstrated in vitro for VEEV nsP1 18 . To explore the potential effect of the MADTP-series on the in vitro enzymatic activity of nsP1, we extensively attempted to purify recombinant CHIKV nsP1 from E. coli, but unfortunately failed to obtain enzymatically active protein. Since in vitro assays were available for purified VEEV nsP1, we assessed the anti-VEEV activity of the MADTP compounds and found that MADTP-372 caused a significant inhibition of VEEV replication in cell culture ( Table 1 , EC 50 of 6.8 \u03bcM). We therefore decided to assess the effect of this compound on the enzymatic activities of VEEV nsP1 using the available biochemical assays. The results of the expression, purification and GTase activity of both CHIKV and VEEV nsP1 are shown in Supplemental Figure 2 .",

Through a non-conventional cytoplasmic capping mechanism, alphaviruses synthesize the minimal RNA cap chemical structure, named cap-0 (m 7 GpppNp-RNA, in which N is the first nucleotide of the viral RNA, p represents a phosphate and m represents a methyl group) 20 . Several reactions are required for the synthesis of the alphavirus cap structure. The N7 position of GTP is first methylated by the methyltransferase activity of nsP1 using S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl-donor. Next a covalent m 7 GMP-nsP1 complex is formed from which the m 7 GMP is transferred to the viral RNA. The amino acid binding covalently to m 7 GMP has never been characterized directly, but histidine 37 has been proposed as the best candidate 18, 21, 22 . Before guanylyltransfer to the viral RNA can occur, the 5\u2032 gamma-phosphate of the nascent viral RNA chain is removed by an RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase residing in the nsP2 protein 23, 24 .",

It is not clear whether this is also the case for CHIKV or other alphaviruses. It may thus be that CHIKV does not have this mechanism and that it is therefore very sensitive to nsP1 inhibitors. The optimization of this compound series is still ongoing and we observed that the second generation of compounds has a modest antiviral activity against ONNV (EC 50 values between 15-25 \u03bcM).",

In such case that the structure of the nsP1 of CHIKV or of another alphavirus would be resolved in the future, this could enable structure-based drug design of new classes of capping inhibitors. It remains to be studied (first in animal models) whether or not CHIKV inhibitors may have a beneficial effect on chronic infections of the joints with this virus. If this were to be the case, this will offer important options for the management of this debilitating condition. Potent and safe CHIKV inhibiting drugs may also be used prophylactically, for example in travelers to endemic regions or as household prophylaxis.",
