Rather, it has been the development of vaccines that has been the mainstay of prevention and intervention strategies for combating human and animal viral diseases. There are presently 15 viral vaccines approved for human use, excluding various subtypes, and the majority of these are live-attenuated formulations (reviewed in (1)). In general terms, these live-attenuated viral vaccines are highly effective because they elicit a balanced immune response in the recipient host, stimulating both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. However, for many viruses, especially those that have associated highly pathogenic characteristics as with Biological Safety Level-4 (BSL-4) restricted agents or retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the use of live-attenuated vaccines is not feasible.",

            "text": "A number of studies have demonstrated the importance of neutralizing antibodies in the protection or recovery from viral infections (2, 3). Indeed, as obligate intracellular parasites, viruses pose significant challenges for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics. Neutralizing polyclonal antibodies have a long history of being effective against some viruses and more recently, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have also shown success. The humanized mAb Synagis (palivizumab), which is currently the only mAb against a viral disease approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been widely used as a prophylactic measure against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in neonates and immune-compromised individuals and is more cost-effective and efficacious than the original polyclonal product (4). Most recently, the anti-RSV palivizumab has been improved, and motavizumab has been shown to potently inhibit viral replication in the upper respiratory tract in a cotton rat model (5). Virus-neutralizing antibodies can also be administered passively to acutely infected individuals and be highly efficacious. The mechanism of passively administered antibody therapy can be viewed as that of an antiviral drug: suppressing infection and permitting the host to mount an effective immune response (6). Today, passively administered antibody is routinely used as an effective antiviral therapy or prophylactic for hepatitis B, varicella-zoster, rabies virus, measles virus, and others (reviewed in (2)). In most cases their use is a first-line therapy as a post-exposure measure or in circumstances where vaccination is not possible. However, serum polyclonal antibody preparations have associated problems related to toxicity and potential allergic reactions, as well as lot-to-lot variation and uncertain dosing regimes (7).",

            "text": "The major advances in furthering the development of specific mAbs has been through the use of bacterial phage-display platforms with combinatorial antibody libraries (8, 9). Further, these phage libraries can be prepared to encode human antibodies as Fabs which contain the light-chain and the first two domains of the heavy-chain or single-chain variable domain fragments (scFvs) containing the variable domains of the light and heavy chains, and this technology has been complemented by innovative affinity maturation strategies to improve antibody binding (reviewed in (10)). These techniques in human phage-display antibody platforms have facilitated the rapid identification and isolation of specific human mAbs, eliminating the immunization, hybridoma development, and humanization processes. In the absence of available vaccines or antiviral drugs, the identification and characterization of new human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that are able to neutralize viruses offers the possibility for effective pre- and post-exposure therapeutic modalities. Such antibodies may also help in our understanding of the virus entry process and its underlying mechanisms, the viral neutralization mechanisms, and in the eventual development of specific entry inhibitors, vaccines, and research tools. There have been many recent examples of the development and isolation of hmAbs using phage-display methodologies reactive against important human viral pathogens including HIV-1 (11\u201316), the paramyxoviruses, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) (17), and the human SARS coronavirus (18).",

All known viral envelope glycoproteins are homo- or heterooligomers in their mature and functional forms (20) and multimeric proteins, like these, generally interact over large areas which often translate into important structural differences between monomeric subunits and the mature oligomer. This feature can also impart significant differences in antigenic structure which has been shown for a number of proteins such as the trimeric influenza HA glycoprotein (21) and HIV-1 gp120/gp41 (22). In addition, some viruses pose significant additional challenges such as antigenic variation of their structural proteins that are important neutralization determinants. Perhaps the best-characterized example of this particular problem is with primary HIV-1 isolates that exist across the many varied HIV-1 subtypes (23). In efforts to circumvent this issue, further improvements and enhancements in the techniques of phage-displayed antibody library panning have been developed in order to better select for broadly reactive mAbs or for mAbs reactive to particular subunits of a multi-subunit viral glycoprotein such as sequential antigen panning (SAP) and competitive antigen panning (CAP) methodologies (14, 15).",

A useful approach to develop viral membrane glycoproteins suitable for panning phage libraries or as antigens for eliciting antibody responses that recognize their native form is to engineer soluble and secreted versions of the molecules. Often, this approach yields a quaternary structure similar to their native counterparts, and for animal viruses eukaryotic expression systems are typically employed such as recombinant bacculovirus or vaccinia virus, or transient or stable expression in cell culture (22, 24\u201336).

Changing the medium will also remove dead cells.Non-expressing cells should die within several days and expressing colonies will start to form. For 293T cells, this may take 7\u201310 days depending on the transfection efficiency. When all dead cells have been removed and colonies are growing well, the cells should be transferred into a 75-cm2 tissue culture flask to form monolayer.Aspirate medium from the 25-cm2 flask and add 2 ml of PBS. Gently rock the flask before aspirating the PBS.Then, add 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA and leave for 5 s. Aspirate the trypsin and use 2 ml of fresh DMEM-10 medium to resuspend the cells and transfer the cells into a 75-cm2 tissue culture flask.Add 18 ml of DMEM-10 supplemented with 150 \u00b5g/ml Hygromycin B to the flask. Allow the cells to grow and form monolayer in 37\u00b0C, 5\u20138% CO2.Once cells have reached confluence, split them at 1 in 5 dilution in selection medium. Repeat this for another two passages. Keep 1 ml of supernatant for affinity precipitation to monitor the secretion level.When cells reach confluence at the third passage, proceed to Section 3.3.3.2.\n",

The Superdex 200 10/300 GL gel filtration column employed here has been calibrated with the molecular weights (29\u2013669 kDa) calibration kit. As depicted in Fig.\n2.4, the calibration curve generated was used to estimate the approximate size of the HeV sF GCN. Well-described calibrating protocols are included in commercially available gel filtration molecular weights calibration kit. Below is a simple procedure used to determine the approximate size of the sF.The inlet tubing of the column should be connected to the appropriate buffer through the P-500 pump. Set the back pressure limit to 1.5 MPa.Connect the column outlet tubing to the optical unit through a flow cell of the UV detector.Wash the column with at least 3\u00d7 column volume (3\u00d7 24 ml) with sterile deionized water with a flow rate of 24 ml/h.Equilibrate the column with the appropriate protein buffer from Section 2.5 with at least 3\u00d7 of the column volume with the same flow rate.Set the sensitivity to 1.0 ABS for 3\u20135 mg of sF, sG, and gp140 and 0.2 ABS for 70 \u00b5l of the recommended concentration of the protein standards. Do not exceed 5 mg of protein and 500 \u00b5l of sample volume. Apply each protein standards as a separate run.Set the baseline for the UV detector and set the chart speed to 30 cm/h. Proceed to next step for sample application once a stable baseline is observed.Stop the pump and disconnect the column\u2019s inlet tubing from the pump. Apply affinity-purified protein or protein standard to the column by using a 1-ml syringe and reconnect the input tubing to the pump. Use the same sample volume for all protein standards and the unknown sample.Start the flow and set the chart speed to 30 cm/h. Use a flow rate of 24 ml/h.Start fraction collector after the first 3 ml has been eluted. Collect fractions at 60 s intervals for at least 40 fractions.Stop collection when the last peak has been observed.Wash the column with at least 2\u00d7 column volume of sterile deionized water followed by 3\u00d7 column volume of 20% ethanol. Store column in 20% ethanol.Obtain the elution volume (V\ne) by measuring the volume of the eluent from the point of sample application to the center of the elution peak. Determine the void volume (V\no), which is the V\ne of blue dextran (2 mg/ml).Calculate the K\nav values for each protein by using the formula K\nav = (V\ne \u2013 V\no)/(V\nc \u2013 V\no), where V\nc is the total column volume.Generate a calibration curve by plotting the calculated K\nav for each protein standard against the log of the known molecular weight.Calculate the estimated molecular weight of the soluble viral glycoprotein from the calibrated curve.Take 2\u201310 \u00b5l from each fraction of all peaks from the soluble glycoprotein for native gel analysis (Section 3.5) to observe the oligomeric species.

Estimation of the following days of incubation for cell growth is based on each T-150 flask containing greater than 3.0 \u00d7 107 cells. To obtain the maximum yield of pure protein, the cells must be very dense when seeded into roller bottles and when infected with purified recombinant vaccinia virus.Ensure cell clumps are broken up by repeatedly pipetting the suspension up and down. An even cell suspension is necessary for an even monolayer in the roller bottles. Formation of cell clumps in the roller bottles will decrease the protein yield.A 10-ml pipette without a cotton stopper is connected to a tube that connects to a 10% CO2, 90% air tank with a pressure controller and indicator; a 0.2-\u00b5m filter membrane should be connected to the tubing.Pre-wet the filter unit membrane with PBS, 0.1% Triton\u00ae X-100 or the appropriate washing buffer before filtering the supernatant. This can be done by filtering 50\u2013100 mlL of wash buffer prior to sample filtering. We find that this procedure will decrease protein lost during filtration. This step is essential for purification of sF.Gelatin treatment is optional. However for 293T and derivatives cells, gelatin-treated surface allows the cells to adhere better during the medium-changing procedures of transfection and hence yields better transfection results.Coat 2 ml per well of sterile 0.1% Gelatin onto a six-well tissue culture plate.
