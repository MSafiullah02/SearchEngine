Anecdotal as it seems, the increasing chatter and concern about an 4 increased thromboembolic risk in these cannot be ignored. Current evidence is circumstantial 5 at best but portrays a picture of a hypercoagulable state in these patients. Published large 6 observational studies that described clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with second study is an observational study from the Netherlands that examined the incidence of intensive care unit patients that reported the incidence of venous thromboembolism to be 20 9.9% 3 .",

A case series from 23 Singapore reported clot wave analysis parameters that were consistent with 24 hypercoagulability in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 4 . A retrospective study from 25 China found that patients who received anticoagulation seemed to have a better prognosis, 1 especially if they had a higher plasma D-dimer concentration 5 . Lastly, a case series from the 2 United States of America described the successful use of intravenous tissue plasminogen 3 activator for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome in three patients that did not 4 respond to conventional treatment 6 . The results of the case series suggests that pulmonary 5 microvascular thrombosis may be the responsible to the high mortality rate in SARS-CoV-2 6 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The theory regarding pulmonary 7 microvascular thrombosis can be further corroborated by a Chinese study that performed 8 post-mortem examination on patients who died of SARS-CoV-2. They reported that 9 thrombosis was commonly found in small vessels, lungs, and even some extra-pulmonary 10 organs 7.",

As such, the International Society on 14 Thrombosis and Haemostasis has recommended that all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 15 including those that are not critically ill, should receive prophylactic dose low molecular 16 weight heparin unless contraindicated 8 . Some institutions are also considering systemic 17 anticoagulation for SARS-CoV-2 patients with high D-dimer levels. This is a serious problem 18 that cannot be overlooked. We strongly urge the medical community to report their 19 experience with thromboembolic events in SARS-CoV-2 patients. ",
