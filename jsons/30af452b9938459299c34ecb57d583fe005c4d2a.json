HCoV-OC43, CoV-HKU1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), belong to type \u03b2.

The connection between RBD and ACE2 also participates in the fusion of the virus and host cells and then stimulates the organism to produce neutralizing antibodies and to mediate cellular immune response [15, 16] . Xiao et al. found that the above process does not require the participation of other proteins, and ACE2 becomes a key target for SARS-CoV fusion with host cells [17] . Scholars have found that the RBD sequences of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV are highly similar [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .

A large number of mononuclear macrophages were observed in pathological lesions of SARS-CoV target organs, and some of them activated; they play the role of phagocytosis and antigen presentation in immunoreaction [23] .

Hyposecretion reduces salivary flow, which is bound to affect the flushing function of saliva for the ductal system, thereby increasing the probability of retrograde infection through ductal orifices [27] . Second, hyposecretion increases the possibility of deposition of inorganic salts on the ductal wall, causing sialolithiasis [28] . Ductal stenosis that may be caused by hyperplasia of fibrous connective tissue around ducts can also reduce the salivary flow, increasing the incidence of the above diseases [29] . Moreover, ductal dilatation also reduces salivary flow, which promotes the formation of mucous plugs that block the excretion of saliva to further aggravate obstruction [30] .",

The result of amylase examination in peripheral blood must be discriminated from that of acute pancreatitis. For acute sialadenitis that may occur in the sublingual gland, it is necessary to consider the difficulty of ventilation caused by swelling of the mouthfloor. If acute sialadenitis occurs in major salivary glands, the amount of saliva secretion may decrease significantly, causing xerostomia, which could be relieved by the use of artificial saliva.",

Clinicians should pay more attention to the status of salivary glands during follow-up after cure, especially if the patient's health is complicated by chronic obstructive sialadenitis and salivary secretion dysfunction. For possible chronic obstructive sialadenitis, ultrasound, sialography, magnetic resonance, or salivary gland endoscopy can be used to understand the shape of the salivary gland and its catheter and to determine whether the stenosis of ducts has occurred. For possible hyposecretion, the measurement of saliva flow or radionuclide imaging could be used to determine the secretion function of salivary glands.",
