            "text": "The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) were initially described in the early 1990s as a family of serine/threonine protein kinases, activated by a range of stress stimuli and able to phosphorylate the N-terminal transactivation domain of the c-Jun transcription factor. This phosphorylation enhances c-Jun-dependent transcriptional events in mammalian cells [1], [2]. Further research has revealed three JNK genes (JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3) and their spliceforms as well as the range of external stimuli that lead to JNK activation. A number of independent approaches have since suggested the importance of JNK-dependent signalling events in both normal development and in disease. This has been highlighted by the striking beneficial phenotypes of JNK gene knockout mice in disease models, including neuroprotection against stroke and improved insulin responsiveness in diabetes (reviewed in [3]).",

We first focus on small molecule, ATP-competitive JNK inhibitors as summarised in Fig. 1\n. Our initial discussion centres on SP600125 developed by Signal Pharmaceuticals/Celgene. In addition, we provide a brief overview of an increasing number of other small molecule ATP-competitive JNK inhibitors now described in the published literature. We then discuss the recent advances in the use of ATP-non-competitive JNK inhibitory peptides. These inhibitors are also highlighted in Fig. 1.",

These residues produce a narrow ATP-binding pocket in JNK that accommodated the planar SP600125 molecule and were predicted to contribute to the specificity of SP600125 towards JNK over the p38 MAPKs [5]. Although this prediction was investigated in mutagenesis studies targeting the JNK ATP-binding site residues, single mutations such as I70V or V196A did not significantly alter SP600125 binding to JNK [6]. Further work is needed to evaluate whether the mutation of residues in combination might produce more striking effects. Direct evidence for the JNK3 residues that interact with SP600125 should drive further structural refinements to increase inhibitor affinities and/or specificities.",

As we will describe, SP600125 can inhibit a number of pro-apoptotic events such as the activation of pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family members, the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cell cytosol, or the activation of pro-apoptotic caspase family of proteases. The reader is referred to recent excellent reviews on apoptosis for further details on the hallmarks of this cell death process [7], [8]. In some cases, it also appears that SP600125 can modulate immune cell responses, and thus provide beneficial effects. We then consider the possible therapeutic applications of SP600125 in the treatment of infectious disease, most notably in its actions to alter the outcomes of viral disease. Taken together, these studies suggest that SP600125 administration will be beneficial in a range of therapeutic applications.",

These in vivo data suggest a critical role for JNK in smoke-induced lung injury, highlighting the beneficial effects of SP600125. Similarly, the administration of SP600125 has implicated JNK in the regulation of the expression of the acute phase protein, pentraxin 3, in the lung in response to the proinflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor [16].

Direct protective effects of SP600125 during kidney ischemia/reperfusion have been observed and have been attributed to JNK inhibition suppressing apoptotic cell death events in a Fas ligand-initiated extrinsic pathway [17]. The involvement of macrophages in renal tissue injury in vivo has also been suggested, with macrophage accumulation being a prominent feature in most forms of human glomerulonephritis and correlating with renal dysfunction. The exposure of bone marrow-derived macrophages to SP600125 prior to transfer into a sheep model of glomerulonephritis caused a 75% reduction in proteinuria, thus highlighting a critical role for the JNK signaling pathway in macrophage-mediated renal injury [18]. The benefits of JNK inhibition in ischemia/reperfusion may therefore include altered inflammatory cell responses that initiate damage.",

Marked protective effects of SP600125 was observed for acetaminophen-induced toxicity both in vitro and in vivo, through the actions of SP600125 were observed to block apoptotic cell death [19]. This has been extended recently to the study of acute hepatic failure following paracetamol poisoning in which SP600125 administration in vivo markedly reduced mortality and hepatic tumour necrosis factor production [20]. Similarly, the subcutaneous injection of SP600125 prior (6 and 2 h) and after (2 h) insult reduced hepatocyte apoptosis, suppressed lethality, and decreased the elevation of serum markers of liver damage in an experimental model of fulminant hepatic failure [21]. In contrast, SP600125 administration was not protective against carbon tetrachloride or concanavalin A toxicity [19]. This highlighted that JNK inhibition will not be beneficial for all forms of hepatic injury, and instead suggests that the targeting of other stress-initiated events should be tested as alternative therapeutic approaches.",

SP600125 treatment has prevented cell death following ischemia or ischemia/reperfusion of the brain [22], [23], [24], [25]. As one example, SP600125 decreased neuronal apoptosis induced by global ischemia/reperfusion in the hippocampal CA1 subregion. Specifically, SP600125 suppressed the expression of Fas ligand that initiates the extrinsic death pathway, the translocation of the proapoptotic protein Bax to mitochondria, the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and the activation of proapoptotic caspases [25]. Similarly, in models of early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage, SP600125 administered intraperitoneally 1 h before and 6 h after haemorrhage demonstrated benefits such as the suppression of caspase activation and concomitant neuronal injury, improved blood\u2013brain barrier preservation, reduced brain swelling, and improved neurological function [26]. SP600125 also prevented apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of Parkinson's Disease [27] as well as neurons in the acute injury accompanying spinal cord trauma [28]. Taken together, these results support the further development of JNK inhibitors as neuroprotective agents and their use in a range of brain insults.",

This was accompanied by deterioration of liver histology and increased neutrophil infiltration that augmented oxidative stress in the reperfused liver tissue [29].

Similarly, chronic SP600125 treatment in vivo in the cardiomyopathic hamster model of heart failure SP600125 increased the number of apoptotic (TUNEL-positive) myocytes and the area of interstitial fibrosis [31]. This was accompanied by enhanced left ventricular chamber dilation and dysfunction indicating the negative effects on cardiac structure and function [31].

ORF36 expression can lead to the phosphorylation and activation of MKK4/7 and, thus, to JNK activation [36].

For example, rotavirus is a double-stranded RNA virus that affects the gastrointestinal system resulting in vomiting and diarrhoea. The use of SP600125 in combination with p38 MAPK inhibitors has suggested that maximal rotavirus-induced interleukin-8 and c-jun transcription required JNK and p38 activity. Significantly, both p38 and JNK were required for rotavirus replication but not viral structural antigen expression [43]. Similarly, SP600125 used together with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibited the establishment of persistent SARS-CoV infection in Vero E6 cells [44]. Clearly, there are now many opportunities to evaluate how SP600125 acts in concert with other inhibitors of intracellular signaling pathways to modulate aspects of viral biology. The most appropriate therapeutic strategy may ultimately require combination therapies of signal transduction modulators.",

SP600125 reduced CVB3-induced phosphorylation of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), but did not alter CVB3 viral protein synthesis, viral progeny release, cell death, or caspase-3 activation in infected cells.

Anthrapyrazoles have been used as anticancer agents due to their toxic effects associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, topoisomerase inhibition and DNA-interactions [52], [53]. Thus, SP600125 administration in vivo may be associated with similar toxicity that would be undesirable when an aim is to prevent cell death.

The rapid transient neutrophil influx was not affected, but the continued treatment with CC-401 suppressed glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage usually seen at 14 days. As CC-401 had no effect upon glomerular macrophage infiltration at day 14, it was proposed that this protection was due to modulation of macrophage activation. Thus, JNK signalling would appear to promote renal injury in acute and progressive rat anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, so that JNK inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of human glomerulonephritis. Similarly, in kidney obstruction, CC-401 significantly reduced tubular apoptosis and inhibited renal fibrosis as shown by interstitial myofibroblast accumulation and collagen IV deposition. This latter effect was attributed to suppression of gene transcription for the profibrotic factors, tumour growth factor-\u03b21 and connective tissue growth factor [55].",

The therapeutic potential for JNK inhibitors is supported by the findings in models of rheumatoid arthritis [60], as well as cerebral and cardiac ischemia [68], [69], and the undisclosed claims for benefits in models of inflammation and diabetes [64]. In contrast, the haemodynamic effects reported for the 4-aminopyridine carboxamide-based JNK inhibitors suggests that further caution may be warranted [70]. Whether undesired side effects arise from JNK-dependent or -independent inhibitor actions must be addressed. Ideally, the effects of many structurally unrelated JNK inhibitory compounds can be compared to determine JNK-independent actions.",

A screen of 100,000 natural extracts revealed an extract from the New Guinea vine, Gnetum latifolium, as an in vitro JNK3 inhibitor [71]. Further purification revealed the JNK inhibitory components to be latifolians A and B (Table 2\n). These compounds form part of the 8-benyl-berberine alkaloid structure class distributed across many plant families. The energy-minimised three dimensional structures of these latifolians were determined, together with their IC50 values towards JNK3 (Table 2) [71]. Further studies including kinetic and structural analyses, should address whether the latifolians are ATP-competitive JNK inhibitors, whether all JNK isoforms are targeted equally, and how these molecules interact with the JNK proteins. This information could then direct the development of new classes of JNK inhibitors that exploit the essential structural features of these latifolians without their complex structure.",

As the c-Jun \u03b4-domain interacts directly with JNK, this peptide would compete directly with c-Jun substrate binding. This peptide has been used to highlight the complexity of JNK\u2013c-Jun-mediated gene regulation in the response to interleukin-1 [73]. Of interest, differences were observed when the effects of the JNK inhibitory peptide and the ATP-competitive inhibitor, SP600125, were compared [73]. For example, of the interleukin-induced genes, 20 genes were down regulated in the presence of either the c-Jun peptide or SP600125. Of these 20 genes, only 4 were down regulated by both c-Jun peptide and SP600125, 6 genes were affected by c-Jun peptide only and 10 genes were affected by SP600125 only [73]. Whether these differences reflect off-target effects of SP600125, or other differences between these inhibitors such as the mode of action, compartmentalisation or stability of the inhibitors remains to be addressed.",

More recently, these peptides have been used to evaluate the kinetic mechanism of JNK2 [82]. The results have provided important insights into the biochemistry of JNK including that protein substrate binding is primarily due to the distal contacts in the JNK2 docking groove, that there is minimal allosteric communication between the protein\u2013substrate docking site and the ATP binding site in the active JNK2 catalytic centre, and that phosphorylation proceeds via a random sequential mechanism [82].",

In searching for possible targets for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of pain, it had been noted that spinal nerve ligation resulted in a slow but persistent activation of JNK in spinal cord astrocytes [88]. Intrathecal infusion of D-JNKI to spinal fluid did not alter the basal mechanical threshold prior to injury but prevented mechanical allodynia for more than 10 days [88]. It should be noted that the pain returned when the 14-day infusion protocol ended [88]. Thus, D-JNKI treatment provided only temporary pain relief and additional strategies are needed to identify targets for long-term pain relief.",

For apoptosis, inhibition of both nuclear and non-nuclear pathways is important [89], [90]. For necrosis, the exact JNK-mediated events remain to be defined, but a number of key findings should direct future studies. Specifically, TAT-TIJIP when applied prior to the transient exposure to glutamate that mimics the excitotoxicity that accompanies stroke, prevented mitochondrial ROS generation, increased cytosolic calcium concentration, and maintained mitochondrial membrane potential [90]. The basic principles of this model involving JNK activation in necrosis are illustrated in Fig. 4\n. More recently, the use of SP600125 or JNK knockout cells has shown that JNK mediates necrotic death via its sustained activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) following exposure to ROS [91]. The direct in vitro phosphorylation assays [91] suggested that PARP-1 can be added to growing list of JNK substrates [92]. It will be of interest to test whether JNK inhibitory peptides can inhibit the actions of JNK on PARP-1 or whether other modified peptide antagonists are required.",

Infection was achieved by direct injection of high doses of virus into the brain tissue of neonatal rats, with subsequent evaluation of brain pathology and survival. Despite the positive findings with D-JNKI delivered intraperitoneally before or after the viral infection, a number of interesting observations should be further considered. Most notably, the symptoms of myocarditis were not blocked by D-JNKI. Thus, reoviral infection remained lethal due to these cardiac effects. It should be addressed whether JNK activation also underlies this cardiac pathology and whether D-JNKI inhibits JNK activity in the heart. The positive effects of D-JNKI in the heart to reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury and infarct size in vivo have been recently reported, but only when delivered prior to the onset of ischemia [94]. In this latter study, D-JNKI when delivered at the time of reperfusion prevented apoptosis and thus limited the cardiac infarct size but, intriguingly, it did not improve functional recovery [94]. The reasons underlying this discrepancy between cardiac cell death in the infarct zone and functional performance of the heart requires further evaluation.",

The reasons for this discrepancy will require further evaluation, but may include the differences in the cell types evaluated as well as the differences in the mechanism of action of ATP-competitive versus ATP-noncompetitive inhibitors [38].

In transplantation, during the isolation process and subsequent clinical transplantation, islets are subjected to severe adverse conditions that impair survival and ultimately contribute to graft failure. Intraportal injection of JNK inhibitory peptides at islet transplantation reduced JNK activity in insulin target organs, prevented islet graft loss immediately after transplantation, and improved islet transplant outcome thus showing the value of JNK inhibition during these procedures [99].

However, extending the half-life of the JNK inhibitory peptide may not always be necessary for the desired therapeutic effect. For example, L-JNKI limited lung ischemia/reperfusion damage, and so D-amino acid-containing peptides were not necessary in this system [14].

A more robust approach has combined genetic and pharmacological approaches to evaluate protein kinase specificity. Modification of the ATP-binding pocket of the protein kinase of interest at the so-called \u201cgate-keeper\u201d residue allows interaction with bulky ATP analogues that may act as either substrates or inhibitors.

Although, high sequence and structure similarity, suggests that this may be difficult to achieve with small molecule inhibitors, in vivo RNA interference (RNAi) remains an option that has been recently used to evaluate the specific role for JNK1 in insulin resistance in a mouse model of diet-induced diabetes [106]. Adenoviral delivery of the RNAi resulted in almost complete knockdown of hepatic JNK1 levels, without affecting JNK1 in other tissues examined. Whilst this was accompanied by reduced circulating glucose levels and enhanced insulin signalling in vitro, plasma triglyceride levels were elevated [106]. This appeared to be the result of the altered expression of several clusters of genes involved in glycolysis and the triglyceride synthesis pathways. Why earlier studies using JNK inhibitors, the overexpression of dominant-negative JNK mutants, or gene knockout studies (e.g. [98], [107], [108]) have not observed similar changes remains to be established. The striking differences when comparing small molecule inhibition or genetic ablation approaches have been recently highlighted [109]. Specifically, for JNK, this has been attributed to compensation in the absence of JNK2 leading to enhanced JNK1 signalling [104].",

A recent example shows the discovery of an anti-hepatitis C virus compound, 4-[2-(5-bromo-2-fluoro-phenyl)pteridin-4-ylamino]-N-3-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl) propyl] nicotinamide, that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor kinase as well as JNK activities [110]. Similarly, indirubin-3\u2032-oxime, a known inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases and glycogen synthase kinase 3-\u03b2, also inhibits JNK [111]. This raises questions on the whether actions of indirubin-3\u2032-oxime to inhibit apoptosis are due to its actions on JNK, cyclin-dependent kinases, or glycogen synthase kinase 3-\u03b2, alone or in combination. Similarly, the neuroprotectant 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (PAN-811), may exert its actions to protect against glutamate toxicity via inhibition of both JNK and p38, or leflunomide may protect again acetaminophen-induced liver necrotic injury through its JNK inhibition [112], [113].",

JNK has been implicated as critical regulators of neurite formation [114], neuronal axon formation [115], and recently it has been suggested that JNK regulates events associated with both health and degeneration or motoneurons [116]. Furthermore, JNK may play protective roles as demonstrated in thrombin-induced ischemic tolerance in the brain [117], and JNK may aid in regulating circadian rhythms [118]. These roles suggest that chronic JNK inhibition may not be desirable. It will therefore remain a challenge, at least in the short term, to define the range of JNK actions in the cell, as these are likely to be many and diverse. Short-term use of JNK inhibitors remains an attractive option in a number of diseases, and the increasing availability of JNK inhibitors will allow rapid progress in determining inhibitor efficacy.",
