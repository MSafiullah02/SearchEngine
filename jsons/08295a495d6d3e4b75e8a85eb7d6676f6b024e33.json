Every individual is vulnerable to microbial infections regardless of socioeconomic status, gender, age group or ethnic background. There has been an explosion of international air travel with an estimated 2 billion passengers travelling on commercial airlines every year. The rapid expansion of globalization and mass tourism has facilitated the spread of disease-causing pathogens from one continent to another at unprecedented rates. This has led to an alarming increase in the number of infectious diseases. According to the World Health Organization, at least 40 new diseases have emerged over the past two decades, at a rate of one or more per year.",

Viruses such as the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus, often labeled as swine influenza virus, and recent H5N1 avian influenza viruses have the capacity to cause global outbreaks in which persons worldwide are at risk for infection and illness. The WHO declared that pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus had reached pandemic proportions in summer 2009 and in autumn, some Northern hemisphere countries such as the USA declared it as a national emergency. Unprecedented vaccination programs against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus were initiated in many EU countries and in North America. Historically, pandemic influenza viruses have caused millions of deaths; the 1918 influenza alone caused over 40 million deaths, more than occurred during the whole First World War. The public health authorities were completely taken by surprise in 2003 when the sudden and unexpected multi-country outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, occurred. The unfolding tragedy of AIDS, particularly in many developing nations, has been vividly highlighted by the scientific and public media. Tuberculosis, malaria and other infections that caused ravages in the nineteenth century are once again resurgent. Several infectious agents, such as vector-borne West Nile virus in the USA, neurological variants of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Europe, and resistant forms of bacteria in several countries have emerged as public health concerns over the past few years.",

The effectiveness of many antibiotics is, however, being steadily eroded by the emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms [1] . This is evidenced by the adverse effects on the control and treatment of deadly diseases caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB and XDR-TB) are raising new challenges in developing countries. The acute respiratory infections in children, mostly caused by Pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae, are becoming more drug resistant. Over 90% of Staphylococcus aureus strains and about 40% of Pneumococci strains are resistant to penicillin, which was introduced in the 1940s. An increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant (MDR) and pandrug-resistant (PDR) Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aerugino sa is being encountered in the clinics; Salmonella typhi, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faeci um, and Shigella dysenteriae have been also reported as MDR. Each year, about 25 000 patients die in the EU from an infection with MDR bacteria, and these 412 Anti-infective activity of immunomodulators This chapter concentrates on immunostimulatory agents capable of enhancing host defense mechanisms to provide protection against infections. Synonymous terms for immunomodulators include immunostimulants, immunoaugmentors, biological response modifiers, or immunorestoratives. Their modes of action include augmentation of anti-infectious immunity by the cells of the immune system, encompassing lymphocyte subsets, macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Further mechanisms can involve induction or restoration of immune effector functions and tilting the balance towards cytokine pathways germane to protection. A diverse array of recombinant, synthetic, and natural immunomodulatory preparations for prophylaxis and treatment of various infections are available today [3] [4] [5] [6] . A concise mind-map of some of the immunomodulators discussed in this chapter is summarized in Figure 1 .",

Certain cytokines stimulate the production of other cytokines and interact in synergistic or antagonistic networks. cytokines exhibit specific immunomodulatory properties that can enable manipulation of the host response to enhance overall immunogenicity, and direct the nature of the response either toward a type 1 or type 2 pathways. In the type 1 response, Th1 cells produce interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-12 that are required for effective development of cell-mediated immune responses Standard IFN-\u03b1 has the drawbacks of a short serum half-life and rapid clearance. To overcome this problem, pegylated forms of IFN have been developed and tested clinically (Box 1). pegylated IFN-\u03b12b (PegIntron) is formed by covalent conjugation of a 12-kDa monomethoxy polyethylene glycol molecule to IFN-\u03b12b, and pegylated IFN-\u03b12a (Pegasys) by covalent conjugation of a 40-kDa branched monomethoxy PEG molecule to IFN-\u03b12a. pegylated IFN-\u03b12b has a prolonged serum half-life (40 hours) relative to standard IFN-\u03b12b (7-9 hours).

The mechanisms for the observed synergistic effects of combination of pegylated IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin have not been elucidated in detail, but in addition to direct antiviral mechanisms, the immunomodulatory effects of both drugs seem to be important, with a shift from Th2 to Th1 cytokine profiles in successfully treated patients. HCV has six genotypes, 1-6, multiple subtypes and quasi-species (Box 2). Genotype 1 is considered to be the most resistant to therapy, whereas genotypes 2 and 3 are more responsive to therapy; genotype 4 seems to be similar to genotype 1 in this respect.

Forty-eight weeks after thymosin-\u03b11 treatment some patients showed normalized ALT and decreased HBV-DNA to undetectable level from serum. The lamivudine and thymosin-\u03b11 combination treatment was shown to be superior to lamivudine monotherapy and gave better virological response, HBeAg seroconversion and biochemical response [14] . The combination of thymosin-\u03b11 and IFN-\u03b1 has been used in patients affected by chronic B and C hepatitis including IFN-non-responders [15] . The combination of thymosin-\u03b11, ribavirin and either pegylated IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b12a, -\u03b2 and -\u03b3 are stated to simultaneously and substantially reduce or eliminate the side effects normally associated with the administration of IFN alone. A number of studies have shown that genotype B is associated with a higher response rate to thymosin-\u03b11 therapy than genotype C.",

G-CSF preparations such as Filgrastim can significantly enhance neutrophil functions in patients with AIDS [18] and reverse neutropenia associated with HIV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. Filgrastim has been granted license extension to cover the treatment of persistent neutropenia at an advanced stage of hiv infection. In one study, Filgrastim-treated patients have been shown to have 54% fewer severe bacterial infections and 45% fewer days in hospital for any bacterial infections [19] . Determination of absolute numbers of CD34 + progenitor cells and progenitor cell function in HIV-infected patients showed that G-CSF mainly increases the number and differentiation of myeloid progenitors. In another study conducted at 27 European centers on AIDS patients with CMV infection, G-CSF (lenograstim) was found to be suitable for the treatment of ganciclovir-induced neutropenia [20] .

IFN-\u03b3 is primarily produced by T cells, NK cells, and NKT cells. IFN-\u03b3 is produced by both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and can induce MHC class I and class II products. The mechanisms of action that distinguish IFN-\u03b3 from type I IFNs are in stimulation of DCs and macrophages to upregulate major MHC molecules to enhance antigen presentation and increase expression of costimulatory molecules. IFN-\u03b3-stimulated macrophages can produce reactive nitrogen intermediates. NK cells secrete IFN-\u03b3 early on during an infection and so facilitate immune cell recruitment and activation, enhancing NK cell cytotoxicity and cell mediated immune responses. Additionally, IFN-\u03b3 recruits neutrophils, and up-regulates chemokines and adhesion molecules, and triggers rapid superoxide production and respiratory burst. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease are unable to generate an oxidative respiratory burst. As a consequence, they develop recurring catalase-positive bacterial infections such as S. aureus, Pseudomonas cepacia, and be dealt with here (see the recommended thebody. com website). It is noteworthy that currently there are more women worldwide who have been infected with HIV and account for nearly half of the over 40 million people living with HIV [22] . Women are more vulnerable to hiv infection than men and their increased susceptibility has been linked to the use of hormonal contraceptives and sexually transmitted diseases. Also, susceptibility to HIV varies throughout a women's reproductive life; adolescent girls appear to be most vulnerable to HIV due to high-risk sexual behavior and a not fully mature reproductive system. In addition, recent studies have indicated increases in the risk of acquiring HIV during pregnancy and during the early postpartum period, part of which could be attributed to higher levels of progesterone. Successful control of the HIV pandemic requires continuing focus on gender. Some of the fundamental issues of HIV transmission have been riddled with problems as it is neither feasible to obtain nor examine relevant cells and tissue at the precise time of HIV acquisition.",

Probiotic supplementation can reduce the risk of travelers' diarrhea in adults [80] . Whole microbes such as Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium species and Saccharomyces boulardii have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and to treat other diarrheal illnesses caused by bacteria [81] . The beneficial bacterial flora present in the human body can be destroyed by antibiotic treatment and permits overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria. Antibiotics are designed to attack specific bacterial pathogens but, in the process, indiscreetly reduce the number of beneficial human microbiota that is part of the gut-associated lymphatic system [82] . Thus, supporting normal flora with live microorganisms can confer a beneficial health effect [83] . Probiotic lactobacilli can improve urogenital health by immune modulation, pathogen displacement and creation of conditions that are less conducive to proliferation of pathogens [84] . probiotics have been used for treating candidal vaginitis and urinary tract infections. Bacterial vaginosis is a common condition that recurs frequently in premenopausal women. It adversely affects women's lives, and is associated with several complications including increased risk of sexually transmitted infections and HIV, and even adverse pregnancy outcome. It is characterized by depletion of the indigenous lactobacilli. The use of probiotics to populate the vagina and prevent or treat infection has shown efficacy, including supplementation of antimicrobial treatment to improve cure rates and prevent recurrences [85] . Probiotic lactobacilli can provide benefits to women being treated with antibiotics [85, 86] .

            "text": "traditional treatment of infections has focused on antimicrobial agents and on the induction of specific immune defenses. The appeal of immunomodulators is inherent in modes of action that are distinctly different from the direct microbicidal action of established antibiotic, antiviral, antifungal and antiparasitic drugs. The past few years have witnessed an explosion of scientific and clinical advances in the field of immunomodulator biology and therapy. There has been considerable interest in the therapeutic use of biologically manufactured cytokines and cytokine inhibitors in infectious diseases, chronic inflammatory conditions and cancer. The immune-based therapies in combination with antimicrobial drugs, such as IFNs and ribavirin for viral hepatitis, especially, have attracted attention. A significant level of knowledge of the structure-activity relationships of chemokines has been amassed. Recent research has elucidated the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory activity of chemokines and has been instrumental in the rational design of anti-HIV chemokine analogues. Activation of innate non-antigen-specific host defenses by recently recognized immunomodulatory agents such as CpG DNA will increasingly find a beneficial role in the prevention of infections. TLR agonists such as MPL are being increasing used. The ongoing and upcoming trials of immunomodulatory agents should provide a wealth of information on clinical and safety matters. It is now also possible to control the deleterious overproduction of inflammatory cytokines observed in certain disease states with several immunomodulatory agents. The potential market involving cytokines is enormous and is poised to grow steadily. As an example, industry analysts estimate that successful CCR5 drugs for HIV and other disease states could generate sales of $500-700 million a year. It is noteworthy that over 60 biotechnology protein drugs, including the recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies that are currently available, represent over a quarter of the drugs recently introduced worldwide.",
