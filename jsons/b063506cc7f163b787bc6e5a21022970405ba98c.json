Although the rheumatologic literature has demonstrated that HCQ is less toxic than chloroquine and a very safe medication, prolonged use and overdosing can still cause problems for our patients; major concerns surround the potential for ventricular arrhythmias, QT prolongation, and other cardiac toxicities.",

However, the first study 4 was small with only 20 patients , lacked randomization, and had a short observation period. The second study 5 lacked a control arm.A recent Chinese trial involving 62 patients 6 , showed that HCQ treatment was associated with a shorter time to clinical recovery, manifested by a reduction in temperature and cough, than placebo. However, the participants in this study had mild disease. Therefore, it is not possible to extrapolate these results to those who are critically ill from COVID-19.
