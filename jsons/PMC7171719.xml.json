            "text": "The MERS-CoV genome consists of 30,119 nucleotides and 11 open reading frames (ORFs).2\n28 The single positive-stranded RNA genome has 5\u2032-UTR (278 nucleotides) and 3\u2032-UTR (300 nucleotides) (Fig. 1). The genes located at the 5\u2032-UTR play an important role in viral replication, whereas the genes at the 3\u2032-UTR encode accessory and structural proteins.13 The 5\u2032-UTR has two overlapping ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b), which gets translated to two polyproteins (polyprotein 1a [pp1a] and polyprotein 1ab [pp1ab]) (Fig. 1).28 These polyproteins are cleaved into 16 functional nonstructural proteins (nsps) through proteolytic activity of two viral proteases called papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLPro) after their self-cleavage from pp1ab (Fig. 1).2\n25\n29\n30 PLpro and 3CLpro are located on nsp3 and ns5, respectively.31 Other nsps encoded by ORFs are nsp12 (for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity), nsp14 (for exoribonuclease activity), nsp15 (for exoribonuclease activity), and nsp16 (for methyl transferase activity) (Fig. 1).2\n32\n33 The nsp14 plays an important role in proofreading activity to monitor the rate of mutation.33 The other genes downstream to ORF1ab encode for structural proteins such as Spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) and accessory proteins.25 The accessory proteins might help the virus in immune evasion by interfering with the innate immune response. MERS-CoV has five accessory proteins and SARS-CoV has eight different accessory proteins.32 These differences might lead to the differences in the effects on induction and signaling of type 1 interferons (IFNs),32 which could explain the greater sensitivity of IFN to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV.34\n35 The viral RNA is encapsidated in the N protein and transported to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), the site of assembly. Viral RNA encapsidated in the N protein and then buds into vesicles lined with the S, M, and E proteins.32 The dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26) was identified as the host-cell receptor for the entry of MERS-CoV.13\n36 Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV bind to large ectopeptidases (DPP4 and ACE2, respectively) to invade the cells.36\n37 The aminopeptidase N (APN) has been reported as entry receptors for several \u03b1-CoVs.38 All hCoV receptors reported so far are exopeptidases, although their proteolytic activity is not necessary for the virus to bind to the receptors, or for entering in the host cells.5\n39\n40\n41 MERS-CoV can bind to the DPP4 of the several species, but the binding site of DPP4 is different in different species, explaining the variation in the susceptibility of MERS-CoV infections in various animals.42 The S glycoprotein located on the surface of the MERS-CoV virion interacts with the receptor binding domain of DPP4 to enter in the host cells.2\n36\n43 The S protein consists of a globular S1 domain at the N-terminal region, an S2 domain with two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2), and a transmembrane domain.3 Lower rate of mutation has been reported so far in the MERS-CoV during transmission in human populations in the recent outbreaks.",

DPP4 has also been reported to be expressed on immune cells, including T cell lymphocytes, and required for optimal function of these cells.38 The events occurring immediately after MERS-CoV binding with the DPP4 receptor appear to be similar to other CoVs. Cleavage of the surface glycoprotein is one of the necessary steps, which exposes the fusion peptide and facilitates the fusion of virus-cell membrane, which results into the release of the nucleocapsid in the cell cytoplasm. Several host proteases, including cathepsin B and members of the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS) family, have been implicated in this process.38\n46\n",

The use of lopinavir/ritonavir has been recommended instead of ribavirin in cases of hemolytic anemia.71 Since ribavirin is teratogenic, patients are advised not to plan for pregnancy for 6 months after treatment.73 Convalescent plasma therapy has been shown some efficacy among patients refractory to antiviral drugs if administered within 2 weeks of the onset of the disease.71\n74 Convalescent plasma therapy could help some patients with severe disease.10\n32\n75 MERS-CoV-specific peptide fusion inhibitors have been reported as a novel approach to treat MERS patients.71\n",

The involvement of pattern recognition receptors and downstream signaling at the cellular level is required to understand the molecular pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. The role of accessory proteins of MERS-CoV should be dissected out to understand their diverse roles in the immune evasion strategies adopted by MERS-CoV to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 expression. There is need to develop suitable animal models to study the MERS-CoV pathogenesis for testing antiviral drugs and vaccines. The threat of potential pandemics is always there because pathogenic CoVs continue to spill over from animals to the human population. The specific diagnostics and control measures are required to avoid the spread among healthcare workers and nosocomial infections among other patients. The knowledge about the dynamics and molecular characteristics of MERS-CoV and other closely related CoVs in circulation is very important to understand their emergence and to strengthen disease surveillance and disease preparedness.",

            "text": "Fig. 1: \nSchematic of the replication cycle of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) on the host cell through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit of the spike (S) glycoprotein, which leads to virus\u2013cell fusion and the release of genomic RNA into the cytoplasm. Initially open reading frame 1a (ORF-1a) and ORF-1b are translated into polyproteins, polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and pp1ab, respectively, which are cleaved by the virus-encoded proteases papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro) into 16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsps). The proteins involved in replication and transcription are gathered into replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) that associate with double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The genomic RNA contains adenylate uridylate (AU)-rich sequences called transcription regulation sequences (TRSs). If the TRSs are recognized by RTCs, then RNA of subgenomic length for transcription will be generated, otherwise a full-length template RNA of genomic length for replication will be synthesized. The newly produced genomic RNAs are encapsidated in the nucleocapsid (N) proteins in the cytoplasm and then transported to the ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) for further assembly. The S, membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins are inserted into the membrane of the rough ER (RER), from where they are transported to the ERGIC to interact with the RNA-encapsidated N proteins and assemble into viral particles. The budded vesicles containing mature viral particles are then transported to the cell surface for release after maturation in the Golgi bodies. Double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are partially generated during viral replication. The 4a competes with Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I product (RIG-I)-like helicases (RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 [MDA5]) to bind to dsRNAs and evades the host immune response.
