Risk increases with the use of nebulizers, 34 bag-mask ventilation, 35 suctioning, intubation and manipulation of the oxygen mask. 36 There is dispute about whether non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) might increase the risk to staff. [37] [38] [39] [40] This might relate to whether a patient's expired air was filtered or isolated during NIPPV. Simple hand washing after attending each patient has again been identified as significantly reducing risk. 41 P2 masks (Fig. 1 ) are the currently recommended Australasian standard for biological inhalational hazard protection; 42 they have a filter efficiency of at least 94% when tested with sodium chloride aerosol (AS/ NZS1716). They are equivalent to the USA occupational health-approved N95 mask. (The 'N' means 'Not resistant to oil'. The '95' refers to a 95% filter efficiency for 0.3 \u00b5m particles.) These masks should be inspected and tested for fit prior to use by trained staff. If these masks are unavailable, an in vivo study using multiple surgical masks showed they do not confer the same level of protection as an N95 mask, but they are better than no mask at all. 43 There is other evidence for reducing the risk to carers during the management of patients with suspected or proven SARS or avian flu. 30, [44] [45] [46] It primarily involves measures to reduce the aerosolization of infectious secretions. The patient should also wear a P2 (N95) mask and ideally be managed in an isolation room with negative pressure. Nebulizers should not be used, instead using inhalers or spacers if appropriate. When possible, respiratory isolation should be maintained by inserting respiratory filters to oxygen masks with exhalation ports, and NIPPV outlets (if deployed). If intubation is required, rapid sequence induction should be used to prevent coughing, and a closed suction system following intubation used for airway toilet. Staff rotations through the area should be minimized in these circumstances, and as always, other standard precautions for infection control should be maintained. Table 2 shows the current Pandemic Influenza PPE Guidelines for Australia, as of June 2006. 42 All staff coming into contact with suspected or probable cases of SARS are adequately protected by use of a correctly fitted 47 appropriate disposable mask/respirator; 48 specifically, a P2 mask or equivalent (N95). The use of gloves is essential, but still does not replace the need for hand hygiene after attending a patient. The gown should ideally cover clothes, be disposable, longsleeved, cuffed and fluid-repellent. Goggles or a face shield are not routine unless there is anticipated contact with infectious spray, splatter, or aerosol generating procedures. If aerosol generating procedures are to be performed, staff should also wear a disposable theatretype cap. If splashing of infected materials is anticipated, a fluid-repellent gown should be worn or a plastic apron can be used as an alternative.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 172, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 297, "end": 299, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 459, "end": 462, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 463, "end": 465, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 568, "end": 570, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 778, "end": 780, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 841, "end": 843, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 960, "end": 964, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 965, "end": 969, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 970, "end": 974, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 975, "end": 979, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1181, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1855, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1990, "end": 1993, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1994, "end": 1998, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1999, "end": 2003, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2004, "end": 2008, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2868, "end": 2870, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1191, "end": 1198, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2776, "end": 2783, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Biological"}, {"text": "The correct sequence for removing gloves, hair and shoe covers, eye protection, gown and mask is disputed.
