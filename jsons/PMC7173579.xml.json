The hypothalamic set point normally maintains body temperature around 37\u00b0C, but there can be significant variation among individuals. Normal temperatures range from 36-37.8\u00b0C, depending on the time of day, with the peak in the afternoon (5-7 p.m.) and the trough in the early morning (2-6 a.m.).

The affected patient may feel cold and seek a warmer environment or add clothing to feel warmer and prevent heat loss. Once these processes have resulted in increasing the core temperature to match the elevated set point, the thermoregulatory center works to maintain the temperature as it does during normothermia. The thermoregulatory point returns to normal once the infection is resolved.

The physician's ability to make a hypothesis about the child's degree of illness, on the basis of observation, is critical in the evaluation.

The Acute Illness Observation Scale (AIOS) (Table 39.3\n), also known as the Yale Observation Score, is a 6-item predictive model graded on a scale of 1-5. Use of the AIOS in conjunction with the history and physical examination has a higher sensitivity for identifying serious illness than history and physical examination alone. The AIOS is most useful in patients younger than 24-36 months; it has not been shown to provide sufficient data to identify serious illness in 4- to 8-week-old infants, and has not been evaluated in infants less than 4 weeks old.\n",

Following the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine in 2007, invasive pneumococcal disease decreased dramatically. Pneumococcal bacteremia decreased from 80% of the cases of bacteremia to 30%. Most cases of bacteremia in children were not occult. Bacteremic children were either ill or had a focus of infection, such as a UTI. In 1 study, the rate of occult bacteremia after 2007 was 0.25%. After the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine was introduced in 2010, the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in children less than 5 years old decreased again with 1 state-based population study showing incidence rates dropping from 46/100,000 to 23/100,000 with the age group most involved being children 2-23 months of age. Escherichia coli is the most common cause of bacteremia in children aged less than 12 months, all due to UTIs. Other less common causes of bacteremia in young children are N. meningitidis, nontyphoidal Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and group A streptococcus. Neisseria meningitidis bacteremia is frequently associated with serious sequelae. Children with N. meningitidis bacteremia are much more likely to progress to meningitis than are those with S. pneumoniae bacteremia. Nontyphoidal Salmonella bacteremia is often accompanied or preceded by enteritis. In some instances, particularly in young infants, the diarrhea is mild or even absent. The prevalence of Salmonella bacteremia among patients with Salmonella enteritis has been reported to be between 2% and 45%; fever is not always present. Salmonella infection seldom causes serious complications in patients with normal host defenses and resolves spontaneously.

The reasoning for this conservative approach lies in the difficulty in evaluating the behavioral state of neonates, the rapid clinical deterioration of infants with bacterial infections, the immature neonatal immune system, and the possibility of life-threatening viral infections caused by herpes simplex viruses (HSV) or enteroviruses. Sepsis evaluation should include culture of the CSF, blood, and urine; a complete blood cell count with differential; examination of the CSF for cells, protein, and glucose; and urinalysis. A chest radiograph should be considered if the patient has signs or symptoms of a respiratory infection.

A number of prospective studies have contributed to the development of specific low-risk screening criteria (Table 39.4). The age groups included vary by study, ranging from 0-90 days to 29-56 days. Because there are differences in study criteria used to define infants at low risk for bacterial infections the most conservative values have been used in the guidelines presented in this chapter.

Sustained or remittent fever remains elevated with little variation during the day and has been associated with enteric (typhoid) fever, tularemia, and rickettsial diseases such as typhus and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Intermittent fever normalizes at least once a day and is associated with tuberculosis, abscesses, lymphomas, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and some forms of malaria. Children with relapsing fever have afebrile days between febrile episodes. Relapsing fever has been associated with rat bite fever, Borrelia species infection, malaria, brucellosis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, African trypanosomiasis, lymphomas, and Lyme disease. Saddle-back or double-hump fever lasts a few days, is followed by an afebrile day or 2, and then returns. It has been associated with some viruses and dengue fever. Double quotidian fever (2 fever spikes each day) occurs in kala-azar, malaria, and gonococcal endocarditis. Periodic fevers occur as acute febrile episodes separated by prolonged afebrile, healthy periods. Diseases to consider include cyclic neutropenia, familial Mediterranean fever, and the syndrome of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA). Periodic fever syndromes have different prevalence patterns in different ethnic groups and different inheritance patterns. A detailed family history is particularly important when these diagnoses are considered (see Chapter 41).",

The initial test is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescent (IFA) test. If this result is equivocal or positive, a Western immunoblot is performed.

Because of the high volume of children with FWS, it is important to have a reliable system for individual patient evaluation and management. Although the majority of patients with FWS have a self-limited viral illness, 5-10% have an invasive bacterial infection, with young infants at highest risk. Because of the potential for morbidity and mortality from the organisms that cause invasive disease, identification of patients at high risk is essential. Although there is no single, timely series of tests that correctly categorizes all patients, the combination of careful clinical evaluation and appropriate laboratory screening criteria can help identify a level of risk in children of different ages. The reduction of bacteremia due to vaccine-serotype pneumococcus has led to a careful reduction in diagnostic testing, especially in the 3-36 month old child with FWS. Red flags include a history of immunodeficiency or other chronic medical illness, no prior immunizations, toxic appearance, signs of shock, petechiae or purpura, poor responsiveness, and other signs of altered mental status.",

            "text": "Some children, who are initially thought to have FWS, develop into patients with FUO. Definitions of FUO in children vary. A practical definition balancing different recommendations is FUO is a temperature higher than 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) daily for at least 8-14 days and no diagnosis after an initial evaluation. Work-up of the patient with FUO should proceed in a stepwise manner. It should be kept in mind that many patients with FUO have unusual, atypical, or complicated manifestations of common childhood illness, mainly infections. Red flags include weight loss, night sweats, signs of organ system dysfunction or failure, or unstable vital signs suggestive of sepsis. Only in this last category should a rapid diagnostic approach be performed and empirical antibiotic therapy initiated.",
