Protein domain is extensively discussed in Chapter 4 of this book. Here we describe briefly the concept of a domain from the perspective of threading. A structural domain is a distinct and compact structural unit that could fold independently of other domains. While many proteins are single-domain proteins, there are proteins with two, three, or even more structural domains (Ekman et aI., 2005) . Our study shows that in the FSSP (Fold classification based on Structure-Structure alignment of Proteins) nonredundant set (Holm and Sander, 1996b) of the PDB, 67% of the proteins have single domains, 21% have two domains, 7% have three domains, and the remaining 5% have four or more domains (Xu et aI., 2000a) . This distribution may not necessarily reflect the actual domain distribution for all the proteins in nature as the set of known protein structures in PDB might have overrepresented small proteins due to the relative ease in solving these structures. For eukaryotic organisms, it was estimated that at least two-thirds oftheir proteins are multidomain proteins (Gerstein and Hegyi, 1998; Gerstein, 1997 Gerstein, , 1998 Doolittle, 1995; Apic et aI., 2001a,b) . This number is somewhat smaller for bacterial and archaeal organisms but still represents a significant percentage of all their proteins. Previously domain partition of multidomain proteins was typically done manually. To keep up with the rate at which protein structures are being solved, there is a clear need for more automated domain-partitioning methods to process the newly solved structures. Currently computer programs are being used for partitioning a protein structure into individual domains.

Based on their argument, they consider that there are three classes of structural folds, which are termed unifolds, mesofolds, and superfolds. Unifolds represent structural folds that each covers only one family of proteins, superfolds represent structural folds, each ofwhich covers many structural folds, and mesofolds represent structural folds in between. For example, TIM barrel covers 31 families, while many unifolds exist in SCO~Based on their observation, they argued that previous models such as Zhang and DeLisi did not fit well with the data of unifolds and superfolds. So a new piecewise model was then developed which treats unifolds, mesofolds, and superfolds, separately. Using this new model, Coulson and Moult (2002) estimated that less than 20% of the protein families belong to unifolds, while 20% of the families belong to a few dozen superfolds and the rest of the protein families belong to mesofolds. Considering that the estimated number of protein families ranges from 10,000 to 50,000 (or 23,100 as one of the popular estimates suggests), we can infer that the number of unifolds ranges from 2,000 to 10,000. The number of mesofolds could be estimated using the Zhang and DeLisi model, based on the sizes of M, and N s , after excluding the unifolds and superfolds. Hence, Coulson and Moult concluded that the most probable size for the number ofmesofolds is about 400. The number of superfolds is believed to be very small, possibly in the range of low dozens.

In their work, structural environments are simply defined in terms oftwo parameters, solvent accessibility sol and secondary structure ss. Specifically the quantity sol of solvent accessibility is discretized into a number of intervals, say 30--40% exposed to the solvent. A secondary structure could be a helix, a beta-strand, or a loop, or it could be defined in terms of more refined categories of secondary structures, say including different types oftums. Then a structural environment for each residue in a template structure could be defined using (sol, s), say (0-10% exposed, alpha-helix).

To facilitate this calculation, the algorithm uses a simple data structure for each structural position L in the current substructure, that keeps a list of structural positions in the other substructure that are close enough to L to have interactions with the amino acid to be assigned to it. Figure 12 .2 depicts schematically the situation where each of the two substructures has a number ofstructural positions, which are close enough to structural positions in the other substructure so that their alignments with amino acids need to be considered when calculating the interaction energy in the other substructure. These structural positions can be considered as extended parts of the other substructure (shown as extended arms for each substructure in Fig. 12.2) . The difference between these extended parts and the original positions ofa substructure is that when doing alignment between the substructure and the corresponding subsequence, we do not have any knowledge about which amino acids are assigned to these positions in the other substructure.

Assume that we can solve the optimal threading problem for each pair of (extended) substructure/subsequence and for each combination of such an assignment. Then it can be checked that the global optimal threading alignment for the whole structure and sequence must be the union of two optimal threading alignments for the two extended subproblems, under one specific combination of the amino acid assignment to the extended part of each subproblem. This realization lays the foundation for the divide-and-conquer algorithm of PROSPECT as it allows reducing a whole threading problem to two smaller threading problems. If we can solve the smaller threading problems, the whole threading problem can be solved by simply going through all combinations of the amino acid assignments to the extended parts for each subproblem to find the one that gives the overall best combined score. During the \"conquer\" step, it needs to make sure that the two optimal solutions, to be combined, to the subproblems is consistent.

The overall computational complexity of the divide-and-conquer algorithm is dominantly determined by the thickest link among all weakest links throughout the bipartitioning of a protein structure into a series of small structures during the whole divide-and-conquer scheme. Intriguingly, we found that this thickest link is generally a small number for the vast majority ofthe solved protein structures (Xu et aI., 1999) , making the actual computing time of PROSPECT threading practically acceptable. This observation has also raised an interesting question: \"Is there something special about the topology of protein structures, which could be further and more rigorously exploited for efficient threading algorithm development?\" 12.4.2 RAPTOR RAPTOR uses a more general framework to rigorously solve the threading problem (Xu et aI., 2003a,b) than PROSPECT. It formulates a threading problem as a linear integer programming (LIP) problem. It uses an integer variable (\"0\" or \"1\") to represent if a particular residue in the query protein sequence is assigned to a particular structural position. Then the set ofall feasible solutions to a threading problem could be defined in terms of a set of equalities or inequalities (called constraints), each of which is defined in terms of the above and other integer variables. The global optimal threading problem is then defined to find a feasible threading alignment that optimizes a given energy function. Generally a linear integer programming problem requires an exponential computing time to find an optimal solution, and hence intractable for large-size problems. Branch-and-bound represents a popular technique for solving linear integer programming problems. Typically, an integer programming problem is first relaxed to a linear programming problem, i.e., variables could take real values as possible solutions. There are efficient algorithms for solving linear programming problems as they are polynomial-time solvable (Papadimitriou and Christos, 1998) . If by chance the solution to the relaxed linear programming problem is all integral, a solution to the original linear integer programming is found. Otherwise the linear solution will be used to constrain the search space, through fixing one variable to \"0\" or\"1\" and then the algorithm iterates this process until all solutions have integral values. An interesting observation made is that for the vast majority of threading problems, this relaxation procedure stops after a few iterations, solving the threading problem efficiently and also indicating that threading problems seem to have a special structure in terms of the integer programming formulation.

In a way, protein structure prediction through protein threading could be considered as a problem to find a global optimal threading result among many sequence-structure alignments. The threading algorithms outlined in the previous section could only provide the best alignment between a query sequence and a particular template structure, i.e., a local optimum. The problem of finding a global optimum from the many local optima for the threading problem represents a highly challenging problem. The key reason is that the alignment scores between a query sequence and different template structures are in general not comparable directly with each other. Some structures might tend to have higher baseline threading scores than the others, no matter what query sequences are used. We can think of this problem using the following analogy from local sequence-sequence alignment problems. Suppose we have two \"template\" DNA sequences (consisting of four different letters). We assume that one sequence is significantly longer than the other one. For simplicity of discussion, we can regard the length of the longer one to be infinite. It is not hard to convince ourselves that for a randomly selected DNA sequence, its best (local) alignment with the longer sequence will have a higher probability to have a better score than with the shorter sequence. The reason is that the longer sequence, by chance, should have a higher probability to have portions of its sequence similar to the query sequence, compared to the shorter sequence. This indicates that the background alignment-score distributions for the two \"template\" sequences are different. Hence, alignment scores against these two sequences could not be compared with each other directly in a meaningful way. Similar can be said about structural templates for protein threading. To compare threading alignment scores, we need to first \"normalize\" the scores so that the quality ofthreading alignments against different templates could be compared with each other. For sequence-sequence alignments, there have been a number of methods developed for assessing the quality of an alignment through assessing the statistical significance of its alignment score. The p-value calculation for BLAST represents a popular method for such a purpose (Altschul and Gish, 1996) . Developing rigorous and effective statistical models for threading has proven to be more challenging than sequence alignment problems. Hence as of now, there has not been a dominating method, like the p-value calculation for BLAST, in estimating the statistical significance of a threading alignment score.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2667, "end": 2692, "text": "(Altschul and Gish, 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Assessing Statistical Significance of Threading Alignments 23"}, {"text": "Early studies on statistical significance analysis ofthreading results were mostly empirical in nature.

Specifically, for a query sequence and a template structure, they have generated a large number of sequences with the same length and the same amino acid composition as those of the query sequence by randomly reshuffling the query sequence and have used these sequences to estimate the parameters ofthe Gaussian distribution. With the estimated Gaussian distribution, they then calculate the probability (p-value) that a random sequence would have a better threading score than the score between the template and the query sequence. The effectiveness of this p-value calculation was demonstrated through their successful performance at the CASP3 contest (Panchenko et aI., 1999) . While effective, the approach has a number of limitations which have limited its wider range of applications.
