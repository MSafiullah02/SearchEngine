It has been suggested that E protein can form a membrane destabilizing transmembrane (TM) hairpin, or homooligomerize to form a regular TM a-helical bundle. We have shown previously that the topology of the a-helical putative TM domain of E protein (ETM), flanked by two lysine residues at C and N termini to improve solubility, is consistent with a regular TM a-helix, with orientational parameters in lipid bilayers that are consistent with a homopentameric model. Herein, we show that this peptide, reconstituted in lipid bilayers, shows sodium conductance. Channel activity is inhibited by the antiinfluenza drug amantadine, which was found to bind our preparation with moderate affinity. Results obtained from single or double mutants indicate that the organization of the transmembrane pore is consistent with our previously reported pentameric a-helical bundle model.",

A somewhat related phenomenon is its cation-selective ion channel activity (Wilson et al. 2004 ) observed in vitro, which has been reported for a synthetic, full-length, SARS-CoV E protein, and also for its N-terminal (40 residues) fragment that encompasses the a-helical transmembrane domain (Wilson et al. 2004) . The channel activity of E protein from two other coronaviruses has been shown to be blocked by hexamethylene amiloride (Wilson et al. 2006) , and this effect has been correlated with inhibition of replication of these viruses. This points to a possible pharmacological target during coronavirus infection, although the precise function of these putative channels is not well known.",

Indeed, we have shown recently that the synthetic transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV E, flanked by two lysine residues (K 2 -ETM-K 2 ) to improve solubility, insert in lipid bilayers as a regular a-helix (Torres et al. 2006) . Multiple infrared dichroic data were consistent with one of the homopentameric models we obtained computationally using evolutionary conservation data (Torres et al. 2005) . We proposed that this a-helical bundle was responsible for the channel activity observed. This prediction, however, was in contrast with a short a-helical hairpin topology, suggested using a slightly longer ETM, which did not contain flanking lysine residues (Arbely et al. 2004; Khattari et al. 2006) .",

No significant amount of monomers (;3.3 kDa) were detected, even in the case of double mutations. In the latter case, it is likely that native monomer-monomer interactions are affected; therefore, the bands found are likely to represent nonnative interactions induced by SDS. These results were identical to those we published for the wild-type (labeled WT in Fig. 1 ) (Torres et al. 2005 (Torres et al. , 2006 . Figure 3 shows the conductance results for our peptide K 2 -ETM-K 2 and its mutants. The I/V plots corresponding to these experiments, which were used to estimate the conductance, are shown in Figure 4 . The wild-type (WT in Fig. 1 ) conductance (;45 pS) is consistent with that observed in previous reports for the full-length and Nterminal fragment (Wilson et al. 2004 ). This demonstrates that the stretch of amino acids used here is responsible for channel activity. Also, we point out that this conductance is observed in the presence of the two lysine residues at N and C termini, which were introduced to increase solubility and facilitate purification of the synthetic peptide.",

Amantadine was injected (60 mL at a flow rate of 20 mL/min) in the concentration range of 0.5-20 mM on the membrane immobilized on the chip. At the end of each injection, after equilibrium, amantadine was allowed to dissociate for 1 min under PBS. Subsequently, the surface was regenerated with PBS (30 mL/min flow rate for 15 min).",

Decane ($99%) and (N-[2hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N9-[2-ethanesulfonicacid]) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, chloroform from Sigma-Aldrich, and ethanol ($99%) and sodium chloride (NaCl) were obtained from Fluka. Ion channel formation of ETM was measured by (Wilson et al. 2004 ) forming planar lipid bilayers across a 250-mm aperture in the wall of a Delrin cup separating the aqueous solutions in the cis and trans chambers. The working volume was of 1 mL in each chamber. A lipid mixture of 5:3:2, POPE:POPS:POPC (50 mg/mL) was dissolved in chloroform and dried under N 2 gas. The lipid Figure 6 . Effect of amantadine addition (100 mM, see arrow) on the conductance of the peptides shown in Figure 1 , except N15A and V25F, which did not show conductance (Fig. 3) . cake was then resuspended in decane. A small amount of lipid mixture was painted across the aperture of the Delrin cup. About 14-20 mg of SARS-CoV ETM protein was added to the cis chamber under continuous stirring, until ion channel activity was detected, typically after 15-30 min. The chambers contained 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (cis), and 5 mM NaCl and 5 mM of HEPES, pH 7.2 (trans). Recordings were performed in asymmetric ionic conditions using a different buffer. The cis and trans solutions were connected via an Ag/AgCl electrode and 1 M NaCl, 2% agar bridge. Currents were amplified using a Warner Instrument amplifier and digitized at 5 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz using pCLAMP 9.2 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The trans chamber was set as reference and the cis chamber was held at different potentials ranging from 0 to 80 mV, in 20 mV increments. Stirring was stopped after detection of channel activity. The ion selectivity experiment was performed with 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) in the cis chamber, and 500 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) in the trans chamber.",
