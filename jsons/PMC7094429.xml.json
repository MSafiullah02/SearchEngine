In addition, some species-specific accessory open reading frames (ORFs) are interspersed among the structural genes. A locus located between S and E is conserved in all CoV genomes [11], and its encoding protein has been studied in several different CoVs. Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV 3a protein has ion channel activity [12], regulates virus production [13] and induces host cell apoptosis [14]. In HCoV-NL63, the ORF3 protein was shown to be N-glycosylated and to function as a structural viral protein [15]. Similar to HCoVs, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) ORF3 proteins were shown to be involved in viral pathogenicity [16], [17], [18]. These results suggest the importance of this accessory protein for the life cycle of CoVs. HCoV-229E encodes ORF4a, a truncated accessory protein at this locus, but its function is still unknown.",

The ORF4a protein formed disulfide-linked homo-oligomers and was predicted to possess three transmembrane domains (TMDs), which indicate that ORF4a could function as an ion channel. The putative ion channel activity of ORF4a was proven in Xenopus oocytes and yeast by the two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) and the yeast potassium uptake complementation assay, respectively. Furthermore, the production of HCoV-229E was reduced in infected human hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh-7) cells when ORF4a expression was blocked by siRNA. In conclusion, our study supports that the HCoV-229E protein may function as a viroporin to regulate virus production. This finding will be helpful for understanding HCoV-229E pathogenesis, and it suggests a novel target for developing drugs against HCoV-229E.",

The ORF4a of HCoV-229E is only 133 amino acids in size, while it occurs with 274 amino acids to the homologous SARS-CoV 3a protein. The amino acid sequence alignment revealed that ORF4a and 3a share about 17% identity, though 3a has a much longer protein sequence (Fig. 1A). Application of transmembrane domain (TMD) prediction programs revealed that the ORF4a protein was predicted to possess three TMDs with an extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus: TM1 (Val-40 to Leu-59), TM1 (Leu-71 to Ser-89) and TM3 (Ala-95 to Leu-115) (Fig. 1B). This predicted membrane topology of ORF4a is similar to SARS-CoV 3a protein, except for a truncated cytoplasmic peptide [12], [21].

The ORF4a-HA protein coimmunoprecipitated with the ORF4a-Flag protein (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the ORF4a proteins form homo-oligomers. Next, to assess whether disulfide bonds are involved in the ORF4a protein polymerization, we treated or untreated the immunoprecipates with \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME), which reduces disulfide bonds within proteins, before running SDS-PAGE gels. As shown in Fig. 3B, when the immunoprecipates were not treated with \u03b2-ME, the monomers (17 kDa) and putative dimers (34 kDa), trimers (51 kDa), tetramers (68 kDa) and pentamers (85 kDa) were detected by immunoblot analysis using an anti-Flag antibody.

To assess the putative ion channel activity of ORF4a, healthy Xenopus oocytes were injected with C-terminally HA-tagged ORF4a complementary RNA (cRNA), and oocyte membrane currents were recorded using a two-electrode voltage clamp. All procedures followed those described previously [24]. Macroscopic currents were recorded in the ORF4a-HA cRNA-injected oocytes and were compared to uninjected oocytes (control oocytes) of the same batch (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B displays the current\u2013voltage (I/V) relationship recorded from oocytes expressing ORF4a protein and control oocytes. Intriguingly, the channel conductance was approximately linear from \u2212 100 to + 30 mV but exhibited an enhanced slope from \u2212 150 to \u2212 100 mV (Fig. 4B).

At positive voltages there was an indication of outward current only for K+ and Rb+, suggesting Li+, Na+ and Cs+ exhibited some inhibitory effect on outward current in this positive potential range (Fig. 5A). Since the constant field theory is invalid to estimate the permeability of many ion channels [25], we focused to calculate the ion selectivity of ORF4a to monovalent cations from the ratios of slope conductances at negative potentials. As shown in Fig. 5C, the relative conductances of ORF4a to the monovalent cations were not significantly different. Thus, ORF4a protein may form a non-selective channel for monovalent cations.",

Viroporins share common characteristics: they are small proteins with 50\u2013120 amino acids and contain at least one hydrophobic transmembrane domain that oligomerizes in the membrane to form hydrophilic pores. These pores permeabilize membranes by transporting ions or small molecules, and these activities participate in many steps of the viral life cycle, such as the entry, assembly and release of viral particles [12], [32], [33], [34]. As described above, the ORF4a protein possesses the features of viroporins, suggesting that the HCoV-229E ORF4a protein could be a new member of the viroporin family. To confirm this, the correlation between ORF4a expression and virus production was tested. A siRNA specifically targeted to the HCoV-229E ORF4a gene was designed (siORF4a), and its knockdown efficiency was determined using Western blot analysis (Fig. 6A). The viral infectious particles in the supernatant were titered by TCID50 assay. As shown in Fig. 6B, the amount of extracellular infectious virus was significantly reduced when 100 pmol siORF4a was used. These results suggested that the ORF4a protein acts as a viroporin and is necessary for HCoV-229E propagation.",

Although the protein sequence alignment showed a little sequence homology between HCoV-229E ORF4a and SARS 3a protein, our data suggest that their functional characteristics are nearly the same. In this study, we confirmed that the ORF4a protein is a new member of the viroporins that contains the common features of this family, such as oligomerization, enhancement of membrane permeability and regulation of virus production. Using the polyclonal antibody anti-ORF4a, we demonstrated that the ORF4a protein could be expressed in HCoV-229E-infected cells. We also analyzed the localization of the ORF4a protein and determined that it was localized to the ERGIC, which is the assembling and budding site of CoVs [1], suggesting that the ORF4a protein might participate in the assembly or release process during HCoV-229E infection. Additionally, we found that the ORF4a protein self-oligomerized, which is an outstanding feature of ion channels [26]. Based on this result, we assumed that the ORF4a protein could form an ion channel. To confirm this, we tested the ion channel activity in both Xenopus oocytes and yeast cells. Indeed, ORF4a expressed in Xenopus oocytes or yeast could conduct ions and enhance membrane permeability. Most viroporins were structured by disulfide bonds or noncovalent interactions to form a tetrameric or pentameric channel [35], [36]. The ORF4a protein has only two cysteines at its C-terminus, suggesting that the ORF4a protein is linked by protein\u2013protein disulfide bonds to form a homo-pentamer channel structure. The exact number of monomers and the ion channel structure still need to be investigated.",

According to the conductance ratios, ORF4a protein may form a non-selective channel to the monovalent cations. Other viroporins, such as the HIV-1 Vpu and the HCV p7, also have been reported to form cation-selective channels and show equal selectivity for Na+ and K+\n[37], [38]. Mehnert et al. have studied the selectivity of Vpu TM peptide to different monovalent cations in vitro using artificial lipid membrane and show a conductance increase in the series Li+\n < Na+\n < K+\n < Rb+\n < Cs+\n[39]. Another viroporin, Kcv, encoded by the Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1 was reported to form a potassium channel and the permeability sequence of Kcv to monovalent cations is Rb+\n > K+\n > Cs+\n \u226b Li+\n \u2265 Na+\n[40], [41]. The typical characteristic of ion channels is the selectivity for one type of ions [42] and this may involve in its viral life cycle regulation [43]. Considering the essential role of viroporins in the viral life cycle, channel inhibitors have become attractive drugs for an antiviral therapy [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]. Since the ORF4a channel showed the similar selectivity for monovalent cations to viroporins above, the inhibitors of these viroporins could have the capacity to block ORF4a channel, which should be further investigated.",

HCV p7 was reported to have ion channel activity in 2003 [28], [50] and shown to be crucial for efficient assembly and release of HCV particles [51]. Recently, Wozniak et al. demonstrated that intracellular H+ conductance mediated by p7 could prevent acidification of the acidic compartments and was required for the virus production [52]. Here, we found that the number of extracellular infectious HCoV-229E particles decreased when ORF4a channel expression was suppressed by siRNA in infected cells. This demonstrates that the ORF4a protein acts as a viroporin that regulates viral production, although the details of this mechanism are unknown.",

Vpu, a protein unique to HIV-1, is the most well studied viroporin in this field. Hsu et al. reported that Vpu induced membrane potential depolarization by interacting with a host endogenous K+ channel TASK-1 to promote the release of viral particles [53], [54]. Tetherin (also known as BST2 and CD317) is an interferon-induced transmembrane glycoprotein that tethers nascent virons on the membrane to restrict the virus release. Vpu counteracts the action of tetherin via downregulation of tetherin from the plasma membrane [55], [56]. Vpu interacts with tetherin and the resulting tetherin degradation via a ubiquitin pathway was found to be relevant for this counteraction [57], [58], [59]. The SARS-CoV 3a protein has been reported to interact with caveolin-1, which is the major structural component of caveolae [60], [61]. In view of the caveolae that was involved in cell cycle regulation [62] and virus uptake [63], SARS-CoV 3a was proposed to participate in these processes.

Based on these data, we could confirm that the ORF4a protein is a viroporin that regulates virus production. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the HCoV-229E life cycle. In addition, the identification of ORF4a as a viroporin may provide a good target for developing novel drugs against HCoV-229E.",
