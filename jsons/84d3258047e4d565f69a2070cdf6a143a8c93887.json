Second, the influenza viruses incorporated into the vaccines are selected on the basis of surveillance data of recent prevalent strains. This best-guess method of predicting future circulating strains cannot account for and, thus, does not protect against unexpected strains or unanticipated pandemics. Third, the 4-6-month period required for formulating a new virus strain into vaccines and ramping up large-scale production of the new vaccines is too long to meet the demand during a crisis situation created by a rapidly moving pandemic. Finally, adverse effects associated with current vaccines and the technical and regulatory hurdles for producing a new vaccine should not be underestimated.",

These drugs fall into 2 categories: M2 inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (zanamivir and oseltamivir). Although these compounds can be used as chemoprophylactics, they are not substitutes for vaccination. Rather, they are used as adjuncts in controlling outbreaks of influenza virus infection. To be effective, the antiviral drugs have to be administered within the first 24-48 h after the development of symptoms. In addition, adverse effects, compliance prob-lems, limited supply, and high costs preclude the widespread use of these antiviral drugs. Of still greater concern is the emergence of stable and transmissible drug-resistant strains of influenza virus [3] . Because of widespread resistance to rimantadine and amantadine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised physicians in January 2006 to stop prescribing these drugs for seasonal influenza virus infections. Similarly, influenza viruses that are resistant to NA inhibitors have been isolated from clinical samples [4] . This raises a serious concern about the widespread use of NA inhibitors.",

However, the limited efficacy and scope of current vaccines and antiviral drugs also demands the development of fundamentally new strategies to control influenza epidemics and pandemics. The natural reservoirs of influenza virus are aquatic birds and wild fowl, in which many different virus strains are circulating at any one time [5] . Viruses frequently are transmitted from wild species to domestic birds, causing devastating epidemics and pandemics in poultry populations. Avian viruses usually require adaptation before they can infect humans, although the current avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has been documented to infect humans directly and to cause severe disease. Annual influenza epidemics in human populations, including the documented outbreaks of 1997, 2003, and 2005, as well as the worldwide pandemics of 1918, 1958, and 1968, have been traced to avian sources [5, 6] . Influenza epidemics and pandemics are likely to intermittently cause havoc in poultry and human populations for the foreseeable future, unless effective long-term control can be achieved.",

            "text": "A critical consideration in developing influenza-resistant poultry is the prevention of the emergence of resistant viruses. One approach is to use siRNA targeting the conserved regions of influenza virus genes, because these regions either do not change or change much less frequently than do other regions, probably owing to structural and/or functional constraints. Targeting the highly conserved region potentially allows the siRNA to remain effective despite antigenic drift and shift. It also has the potential to reduce the emergence of viable resistant variants. Another approach is to simultaneously express multiple shRNAs. The mutation rate of influenza virus is estimated to be mutations/nucleotide/infection cycle [15] . If 4 \u03ea5 1.5 \u03eb 10 shRNAs are expressed simultaneously, the probability of the emergence of a resistant virus can be reduced to 1 resistant virus/ virions. This probability can be assessed by use 21 3 \u03eb 10 of the following example. The United States produced \u223c9 billion broiler chickens in 2006. For a resistant virus to arise, each chicken would have to produce infectious virions. Un- 11 3 \u03eb 10 der the assumption that 1 infected cell produces new 3 3 \u03eb 10 infectious virions, 10 8 cells/chicken would have to be infected. Thus, lentiviral vectors expressing \u04434 shRNAs specific for the conserved regions of the influenza virus genome should be used for transgenic poultry production.",
