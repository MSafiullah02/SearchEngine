It is believed that vaccines save at least 2-3 million lives per year worldwide. Smallpox has been eradicated and polio has almost disappeared worldwide through global vaccine campaigns. Most of the viral and bacterial infections that traditionally affected children have been drastically reduced thanks to national immunization programs in developed countries. However, many diseases are not yet preventable by vaccination, and vaccines have not been fully exploited for target populations such as elderly and pregnant women. This review focuses on the state of the art of recent clinical trials of vaccines for major unmet medical needs such as HIV, malaria, TB, and cancer. In addition, we describe the innovative technologies currently used in vaccine research and development including adjuvants, vectors, nucleic acid vaccines, and structure-based antigen design. The hope is that thanks to these technologies, more diseases will be addressed in the 21st century by novel preventative and therapeutic vaccines.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Progress in science has always been the major driving force for development of effective vaccines (Fig 1) . Table 1 provides a list of all licensed human vaccines, grouped in different classes based on the method of production (reviewed in Plotkin et al, 2008; Levine et al, 2012; De Gregorio et al, 2013) . The first golden age of vaccines started when Pasteur, Koch, Ramon, and M\u00e9rieux established the germ theory and developed vaccines based on live-attenuated or inactivated (killed) pathogens and on inactivated toxins (toxoids). These vaccines protected against rabies, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and tuberculosis in infants. The second golden age of vaccines was a consequence of innovation in cell culture technologies in the second half of the 20th century. The 'cell culture revolution' allowed for effective inactivated vaccines to prevent polio (IPV) and hepatitis A, and live-attenuated vaccines against polio (OPV), mumps, rubella, measles (MMR), rotavirus, and varicella. Progress in microbiology led to the development of polysaccharide vaccines against some strains of pneumococcus and meningococcus. However, these vaccines were not effective in children. To improve immunogenicity, the antigenic polysaccharides, which primarily induce a B-celldependent immune response, were covalently linked to carrier proteins, thereby providing helper T-cell activation. The resulting glycoconjugate vaccines induced a better antibody response and were effective in all age groups. Today, very effective glycoconjugate vaccines are available for Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococcus, and the meningococcus types A, C, W, and Y. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) cannot be easily cultured in vitro for vaccine production, and the first-generation HBV vaccine consisted of purified HBV surface antigen from the blood of infected donors. Progress in molecular biology allowed the improvement of the vaccine against HBV and, more recently, the development of a new vaccine preventing HPV. Both vaccines are made of purified recombinant protein antigens that form a non-infectious viral-like particle (VLP). In the last decade, progress in genomics has also contributed to vaccine development. Unlike the other meningococci, Neisseria meningitidis type B (MenB) is covered by a capsular polysaccharide that is similar to polysaccharide present in human tissues and therefore poorly immunogenic. As such, the MenB capsular polysaccharide cannot be used in a glycoconjugate vaccine, unlike what was efficiently done for types A, C, W, and Y (Pace, 2009) . Making a vaccine based on recombinant proteins was also challenging because of the extreme antigenic variation seen in circulating MenB strains. The problem was solved through a rational selection of candidate antigens based on genomic information, called 'reverse vaccinology' (Pizza et al, 2000; Rappuoli, 2000) . Through this process, three protective antigens that are common to multiple MenB strains were expressed as recombinant proteins and combined with a MenB outer membrane vesicle (OMV), resulting in the first universal vaccine against type B meningococcus (Giuliani et al, 2006) . All the vaccines described above are given to healthy subjects to prevent infections. In addition, some prevent cancer associated with chronic infection, HPV, and HBV (Pineau & Tiollais, 2010; Romanowski, 2011) . The therapeutic use of vaccination based on specific antigens associated with the disease has not had equal success despite many attempts to cure chronic infections and cancer. However, in 2010, the FDA approved Sipuleucel-T, the first therapeutic vaccine for prostate cancer. The administration of Sipuleucel-T is very different from all licensed preventive vaccines. Blood cells from each individual prostate cancer patient are exposed to a prostate antigen (prostatic acid phosphatase) fused to the cytokine GM-CSF and then re-infused to the same patient (Plosker, 2011) . Although the immunization process is very complex and expensive, Sipuleucel-T represents a milestone and may pave the way for a wider use of cancer vaccine immunotherapy based on innovative technologies that allow for simpler immunization methods. Several cancer vaccine candidates, based on recombinant antigens or viral vectors, are in advanced development with promising phase II results (Kruit et al, 2013) . If they confirm their partial efficacy in larger phase III trials, the next step will be to combine cancer vaccines with additional immunotherapies such as monoclonal antibodies acting on negative regulators of the immune response (e.g., CTLA-4 and PD-1 Hodi et al, 2010; Hamid et al, 2013) recently described by Science as the 'breakthrough of the year' for 2013 (Couzin-Frankel, 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 240, "end": 260, "text": "Plotkin et al, 2008;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 261, "end": 280, "text": "Levine et al, 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 281, "end": 305, "text": "De Gregorio et al, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2567, "end": 2579, "text": "(Pace, 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 2860, "end": 2879, "text": "(Pizza et al, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 2880, "end": 2895, "text": "Rappuoli, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 3151, "end": 3173, "text": "(Giuliani et al, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3343, "end": 3368, "text": "(Pineau & Tiollais, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 3369, "end": 3386, "text": "Romanowski, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 3947, "end": 3962, "text": "(Plosker, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 4356, "end": 4375, "text": "(Kruit et al, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 4616, "end": 4649, "text": "CTLA-4 and PD-1 Hodi et al, 2010;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4650, "end": 4668, "text": "Hamid et al, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 4742, "end": 4764, "text": "(Couzin-Frankel, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 98, "end": 105, "text": "(Fig 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 108, "end": 115, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In summary, the application of innovative technologies in the last century has allowed for the development of novel vaccines targeting new diseases or new target populations.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects more than 30 million people worldwide (UNIAIDS Global Report at www.unaids.org/en), while malaria and tuberculosis kill almost 3 million people every year (WHO report 2010: www.who.int) .

Pathogens that exist in multiple strains exhibiting a moderate degree of antigen variability require multivalent vaccines. The most successful example of this is possibly pneumococcus, for which a 7-valent and a 13-valent conjugate and a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine have been developed covering a progressively broader number of serogroups (Prymula & Schuerman, 2009; Duggan, 2010) . A more extreme situation exists for seasonal influenza vaccines (an organism which rapidly alters), which, while multivalent, must be redeveloped every year incorporating the influenza surface antigens of predicted circulating disease variants. However, until now, vaccines have not been successful in protecting against pathogens characterized by a high mutation rate, such as HIV and HCV that are able to evade the antibody response by modifying their target antigens during the course of infection. In addition, most licensed vaccines are believed to prevent infections by generating neutralizing or opsonizing antibodies. There is, nonetheless, a crucial contribution of T cells. For instance, T helper cells contribute to efficient B-cell activation, influence antibody isotype switching Glossary Vaccine all biological preparations that enhance immunity against disease and either prevent (prophylactic vaccines) or treat disease (therapeutic vaccines): The word 'vaccine' originates from the Latin Variolae vaccinae (cowpox), which Edward Jenner demonstrated in 1798 could prevent smallpox in humans Immunotherapy treatment of disease by inducing, enhancing, or suppressing an immune response Live attenuated a viable infectious organism with reduced virulence or ability to cause disease: infectious agents may be attenuated by in vitro passage, chemically, genetically, or other means Inactivated a killed infectious organism: whole organisms may be inactivated by chemical, thermal, or other means Subunit vaccines vaccines derived from components of the disease-causing organism, such as specific proteins and polysaccharides Polysaccharide vaccines vaccine derived from the complex sugar capsular polysaccharide that covers the surface of encapsulated bacteria Conjugate vaccine vaccines derived from the covalent linkage (conjugation) of polysaccharides to a carrier protein for enhanced immunogenicity Combination vaccines vaccines against different disease-causing organisms combined into one formulation for a unique immunization Synthetic vaccines vaccines based on synthetic components such as nucleic acids or synthetic peptides, polysaccharides, or antigens Recombinant derived from the use of recombinant DNA technology Reverse vaccinology a method of producing a vaccine by first studying the genomic information of the organism (in silico) to determine which genes code for candidate antigenic proteins, followed by in vitro and in vivo testing of those candidates and selection for vaccine development Serotype the type of a microorganism determined by its constituent antigens Serogroups a group of serotypes having one or more antigens in common Neutralizing antibodies An antibody that reduces or abolishes some biological activity of a soluble antigen or of a living microorganism Opsonizing antibodies An antibody that causes bacteria or other foreign cells to become more susceptible to the action of phagocytes Nosocomially acquired antibiotic-resistant bacteria hospitally acquired bacteria that are no longer susceptible to treatment with antibiotics and activation of target cells (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils). For example, differential induction of Th1/Th17 versus Th2 cells leads to improved protection in whole cell bacterial vaccines like pertussis (Ross et al, 2013) . Also, a direct contribution of cellular immunity, in the form of cytotoxic CD8 and CD4 T cells, has been shown to play a role for live-attenuated vaccines. Conventional technologies have had only limited success in preventing infections that are controlled predominantly by T cells, such as tuberculosis. The challenge for the future is even greater, as some infections that are caused by highly variable pathogens may not be preventable by antibodies alone and will require the correct combination and quality of humoral and cellular immune responses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 483, "end": 510, "text": "(Prymula & Schuerman, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 511, "end": 524, "text": "Duggan, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3835, "end": 3853, "text": "(Ross et al, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Medical needs and challenges"}, {"text": "For many pathogens, natural infection leads to immunity of the host against re-infection.

For instance, for those diseases that do not induce sterilizing immunity after natural infection (e.g., malaria, RSV, or P. aeruginosa) or those that cause persistent or latent infection (e.g., HIV and HCV and S. aureus), a vaccine-induced protective immune response must go beyond the mechanisms that nature has evolved.

The manufacturing of nucleic acid-based vaccines also offers the potential to be relatively simple and inexpensive. For about 20 years, most of the attention was focused on DNA vaccines, which have been shown to be potent in a wide variety of animal species, and several products are now licensed for commercial veterinary use (Draghia-Akli et al, 1997; Davis et al, 2001; Garver et al, 2005; Grosenbaugh et al, 2011) . In humans however, while showing much promise in preclinical models, DNA vaccines have shown reduced and disappointing potency in the clinic (reviewed in Ferraro et al, 2011) . This was likely due to poor delivery of the vaccine DNA into human cells and insufficient stimulation of the human immune system. The latest generation of DNA vaccines may rely on improved delivery either through the use of electroporation (Sardesai & Weiner, 2011) or through co-administration of genes encoding immunostimulatory cytokines (Lori et al, 2006; Flingai et al, 2013) to overcome these limitations.

More recently, heterologous primeboost regimens mainly use a viral vector or a DNA vaccine for priming, followed by a boost with a protein-based vaccine. For example, in the prime-boost strategy of the RV144 study, subjects were primed with a canarypox vector encoding gag, env, and protease and boosted with a gp120 subunit vaccine (Rerks-Ngarm et al, 2009 ).

The answer will not be the same for different pathogens and will be based on the integration of different immune effector mechanisms of the appropriate quality. To this end, it will be important to assess the impact of novel vaccine technologies in human trials and correlate multiple immune readouts with protection. The progress in genomics allows the generation of huge amounts of high-throughput data from human blood samples including RNA and protein expression profiles, B-cell repertoire analysis, single cell analysis, and analysis of genomic polymorphism. Systems biology is required to interrogate the genomic data and identify molecular signatures which correlate with the immunological analyses obtained from the same subjects through classical immunological assays for antibodies and T-cell characterization (Pulendran et al, 2010) . In studies of vaccine responses with the yellow fever and influenza vaccine, these approaches have already been successfully applied leading to the identification of 'protective signatures' to predict immunogenicity of the vaccine in human subjects (Gaucher et al, 2008; Querec et al, 2009) . The final goal of using systems biology to interrogate human vaccine responses is to identify biomarkers of safety and efficacy. These vaccine biomarkers have the potential to accelerate the time of vaccine development, allowing for the selection of the most promising vaccine candidates in early exploratory clinical trials, before proceeding to long, expensive efficacy trials that involve a very large number of subjects.

Novel technologies, such as the virus-like particles, have allowed the development of vaccines against HPV (Siddiqui & Perry, 2006; Keam & Harper, 2008) . Reverse vaccinology, through mining of genome sequences for high-throughput antigen discovery, has successfully allowed the development of a novel multicomponent recombinant vaccine against meningococcus type B (Giuliani et al, 2006) . The first therapeutic vaccine based on blood cell infusion has been licensed for prostate cancer (Plosker, 2011) . Several tools have been developed and in some cases already tested in human trials, which will greatly support the discovery and rational design of novel vaccines against difficult targets such as HIV, malaria, TB, dengue, and S. aureus, where conventional technologies have failed. The hope is that, thanks to these technologies, more infectious diseases will be preventable by vaccinating children, adolescents, adults and elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised subjects. Novel vectors and adjuvants may also allow the development of therapeutic vaccines to treat different forms of cancer, chronic infections, and other inflammatory disorders. The development of innovative immunization regimes and novel delivery technologies provides unprecedented means to not just augment but to shape the immune responses. What the experiences of recent clinical trials have taught us is that while the quantity or magnitude of immune responses is important, the quality or flavor of these responses is equally important, and predicting immunogenicity does not necessarily translate into predicting protection. For many of the elusive targets in vaccine development, one of the most challenging gaps to fill is that of identifying biomarkers or correlates of protection. An immediate goal we should set is to exploit the trials undertaken to date, in the attempt to identify signatures of vaccine efficacy that can guide early selection of the most promising vaccine candidates for the future.
