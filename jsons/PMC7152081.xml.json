Increasingly, humans are moving from one region to another, thereby becoming exposed to a variety of potential pathogens and also serving as part of the global dispersal process.1 Microbes picked up at one time and in one place may manifest in disease far away in time and place. Because many microbes have the capacity of persisting in the human host for months, years or even decades, the relevant time frame for study of exposures becomes a lifetime. Furthermore, microbes also move and change and reach humans via multiple channels.",

This chapter reviews the factors that shape the global distribution of infectious diseases and the forces that are expected to shift distributions in the future. Several examples are used to illustrate the broad range of factors that affect the distribution and expression of infectious diseases.2\n",

A century and a half ago, John Snow noted that epidemics of cholera followed major routes of commerce and appeared first at seaports when entering a new region. Yersinia pestis, the cause of plague, accompanied trade caravans and moved across oceans with rats on ships. Exploration of the New World by Europeans introduced a range of human pathogens that killed one-third or more of the local populations in some areas of the Americas. The plants and animals introduced as a result of this exploration have also had profound and long-lasting consequences for the ecology and economics of the new environment.3 The speed, reach and volume of today's travel are unprecedented in human history and offer multiple potential routes to move biologic species around the globe. Pathogens of animals and plants are being transported as well, and this can affect global food security.4 Establishment of arthopod vectors, such as mosquitoes that are competent to transmit human pathogens, in new geographic areas can expand the regions that are vulnerable to outbreaks of some vector-borne infections. This chapter focuses only on pathogens that directly affect human health and on their sources (Table 101.1\n). When thinking about geography of human infections, it is useful to consider both the origin of the organism and the conveyor or immediate source for the human (Fig. 101.1\n).",

Malaria is a vector-borne infection that cannot become established in a region unless a competent vector is present. The presence of a competent vector is a necessary but not sufficient condition for human infection. The mosquito must have a source of malarial parasites (gametocytemic human or rarely other species), appropriate bioclimatic conditions and access to other humans. The ambient temperature influences the human biting rate of the mosquito, the incubation period for the parasite in the mosquito and the daily survival rate of the mosquito. Prevailing temperature and humidity must allow the mosquito to survive long enough for the malarial parasite to undergo maturation to reach an infective state for humans. Competent vectors exist in many areas without malaria transmission, because the other conditions are not met. These areas are at risk of the introduction of malaria, as illustrated by several recent examples in the USA and elsewhere.7,\n8\n",

Pilgrims carried an epidemic strain of group A N. meningitidis from southern Asia to Mecca in 1987. Other pilgrims who became colonized with the epidemic strain introduced it into sub-Saharan Africa, where it caused a wave of epidemics in 1988 and 1989. Using molecular markers, investigators were able to trace the spread of the epidemic clone to several other countries.25 In 1996 in Africa, major outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis occurred(>185 000 reported cases with a case fatality rate of \u223c10%) caused by N. meningitidis serogroup A, clone III-1.26 A virulent group C, ET-15 strain of N. meningitidis spread in Canada and was associated with an increased case fatality rate and a higher proportion of cases in persons over the age of 5 years.27 In these examples, the virulence of the microbe and travel and trade acted synergistically to change the epidemiology and burden of disease. In the spring of 2000 serogroup W135 N. meningitidis caused an outbreak of infection in pilgrims to the Hajj and subsequently spread to their contacts and others around the world. Studies using serotyping, multilocus sequence typing, multilocus DNA fingerprints and other techniques found identical W135 isolates in multiple countries. Pilgrims are required to receive a meningococcal vaccine but before this outbreak, pilgrims from many countries received a vaccine that protected against serotype A but not W135. The vaccine reduces risk of disease but does not prevent oropharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis.28\n",

In March 1930, an entomologist in Natal, Brazil, came upon Anopheles gambiae larvae in a small, wet, grassy field between a railway and a river.55 He was surprised, because the usual habitat for this mosquito was Africa. Investigation revealed that the probable route of entry into South America was via boats that made mail runs between Dakar in Senegal and Natal in Brazil, covering the 3300 km in less than 100 hours. In Dakar the boats were anchored a distance from the shore within easy flight range of A. gambiae. In Brazil, over the ensuing years, the mosquito spread along the coastal region and inland. Natal, as an ocean port, terminus of two railway lines and the hub of truck, car and river transportation, was well suited for dissemination of A. gambiae into the region. Although malaria already existed in the region, the local mosquitoes were not efficient vectors. Anopheles gambiae, in contrast, lived in close proximity to humans, entered houses, sought human blood and was an efficient biter. In 1938 and 1939, devastating outbreaks of malaria killed more than 20 000 persons. In this instance, the simple introduction of a new vector into a region led to severe problems. Fortunately, an intensive (and expensive) eradication campaign was effective.",

Some persons, for example, are genetically resistant to infection with parvovirus because they lack appropriate receptors on their erythrocytes.68 Persons lacking Duffy factor cannot be infected with the malarial parasite, P. vivax.",

Changes in virulence and shifts in resistance patterns will also require ongoing surveillance and communication to health-care providers. Multiple factors favor even more rapid change, perhaps in unexpected ways, in the future: rapidity and volume of travel, increasing urbanization (especially in developing regions), the globalization of trade, multiple technologic changes that favor mass processing and broad dispersal, and the backdrop of ongoing microbial adaptation and change, which may be hastened by alterations in the physicochemical environment.",
