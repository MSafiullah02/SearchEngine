According to a new study, the benefits of using more wood in building and bridge construction are multiplied when you account for the energy-and emission-intensive steel and concrete that the wood replaces. (1) Researchers from Yale University and the University of Washington calculated that increasing logging (from the current 20 percent to over 34 percent of global annual sustainable growth) could be a huge net positive for the climate. Using wood in place of steel and concrete could prevent 14 to 31 percent of global CO 2 emissions. In addition, this increased wood usage could result in a 12 to 19 percent decrease in annual fossil fuel consumption, since scrap wood could be burned instead of hydrocarbons for energy. \u2022 over the past several years, an unexpected flood of cheap natural gas has taken a bite out of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. But natural gas is still a fossil fuel. As John Carey explained in \"Gas Pains\" (Conservation, Summer 2013), renewable energy sources need to reach price parity with gas in order for it to be a bridge to a low carbon future. And that's now happening-in Texas, of all places.",

The panels will be installed in West Texas and are expected to come online in 2016. According to Austin Energy, long-term fixed pricing will range from 4.5 to 5.5 cents/kWh. It's being touted as one of the lowest prices for contracted solar. That price falls below the company's estimates for natural gas (7 cents/kWh), coal (10 cents/kWh), and nuclear (13 cents/kWh), though the deal relies on the federal solar Investment Tax Credit. \u2022 solar is big -and cheap-in Texas ever since conservationists started to marry protected area management with social programs, the relationship has been rocky and ill-defined. in \"Conservation and Poverty\" (Conservation, Spring 2011), Fred Pearce explored economic advancement in biodiverse regions. a recent study looked at communities in Costa rica whose welfare improved after protected areas were established nearby. (1) economists found that tourism and recreation were the most important contributors to poverty reduction in those communities. in fact, increased tourism and recreation accounted for nearly two-thirds of the positive impact. in contrast, infrastructure upgrades and ecosystem services contributed very little. \u2022 Conservation and Poverty reduction 1.

The study found that in states where electricity is generated predominantly from renewable or nuclear energy rather than coal and natural gas, the GWP of an electric battery bus is lower than that of a diesel bus. Right now, only eight states have a high enough proportion of renewable or nuclear energy in their electricity-generating capacities to make this possible. In two of those eight states, Washington and Oregon, electric buses have a lower carbon footprint because they draw on hydroelectric power. \u2022 in September 2012, a man with pneumonia was admitted to a hospital in Saudi arabia. His doctors identified the source of his infection as a type of coronavirus new to medicine. these viruses are found around the world in bats, birds, cats, dogs, pigs, mice, horses, whales, and humans. they wreak havoc on the lungs, intestines, liver, and nervous system. Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, the physician-scientists report that the closest known relatives of the new virus are coronaviruses found in bats, called HKu4 and HKu5.

(3) in January 1996, the Colorado Department of Public Health and environment confirmed that the Salmonella enteritidis bacterium had infected 39 children, with perhaps more than 300 additional children infected. (Since it usually resolves itself in most patients, milder cases of salmonellosis tend to be underreported; however, it can also include painful abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and fevers.) Yet this outbreak was different because the origin wasn't undercooked meat. it was the Denver Zoo. in particular, it was one of four individuals in a temporary Komodo dragon exhibit. (4) after careful analysis, CDC researchers determined that the dragons, one of whom was infected, had stood in fecally contaminated mulch and placed their front paws atop the barriers of their enclosure. Zoo visitors had touched those same barriers and later placed their contaminated hands into their mouths or cross-contaminated their food. Because the reptile house had such finely tuned temperature and humidity, the bacteria could have survived on an exposed surface-such as the railings surrounding the Komodo dragon enclosure-for up to ten months.",

But this held true only up to a point: the effect wore off above a certain temperature, as a team led by psychologist Jeff Joiremen of Washington State university in Pullman reported in 2010 in the Journal of Environmental Psychology. (1) two recent studies in Nature Climate Change reveal how local conditions influence public opinion on a national scale. a review of polling and temperature data from 89 nations found that people living in countries with rising average temperatures are more likely to perceive a warming climate, Yale university's Peter Howe and colleagues reported in 2011. (2) and in the u.K., a 2010 survey of 1,822 people found that those who had experienced bad floods were more likely to be concerned about climate change and to support reducing energy use to curb emissions, alex Spence of the university of nottingham and colleagues reported in 2012. (3) Such findings highlight the important role that personal experience and extreme weather events play in shaping public attitudes about climate change, researchers say. But those two factors alone aren't likely to spur a quick response, warns a new study. Because extreme weather is relatively rare, and because there is great natural variability in local conditions, it could take decades for a nation to reach a political tipping point and take action, Katharine ricke and Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie institution for Science in Stanford, California, wrote in Nature Climate Change (4).",

For a steer, the ratio is approximately 10:1; for chickens, it's around 2:1. the wide gulf in FCrs occurs because each of these animals is working with a different physical apparatus as well as different fuel sources. Cattle take in mainly grass (or grain, in a feedlot environment); pigs and chickens are omnivorous like we are, eating a diet of corn, other grains, and processed animal protein; fish are generally obligate carnivores, eating mainly other fish. and finally, we get to bugs. Crickets, like chickens, are omnivorous. they'll basically eat anything they can get their palpi on. Cornmeal, compost, cat food-all are fair fare for the cricket. they have a digestive system somewhat like that of a tiny chicken: instead of a gizzard, they have a crop with hardened parts that act like teeth, grinding up their food. they also have a tiny cecum for fermentation. But the special thing that crickets, along with many other invertebrates (like termites, of course), produce is cellulase-that same enzyme the bacteria in a cow's rumen use to break down the fiber in plants. until quite recently, it was thought that the production of cellulase was limited to plants, bacteria, and fungi; but many insect species have been found to carry it as well, in both their mouths and guts. For some evolutionary reason, only invertebrates produce this enzyme directly, but it certainly helps with their digestion of plants.",

One three-month generation later, that number jumps to 312,500,000. if 1,000 crickets weigh a pound, that's 312,500 pounds of cricket in a year, a weight equivalent to 312 cows. even if only a tenth of the crickets survive, that's still equivalent to more than 30 cows. most farmable insects don't need the space that cows, pigs, chickens, or even fish do. Whereas cows need space to graze, chickens and pigs need room to forage, and fish need either roped-off sections of the ocean (with the risk of escape and potential contamination of wild populations) or pools of constantly purified water, insects like crickets and mealworms do just fine in small boxes.

So far, myles allen's research hasn't yet made its way into these calculations. But he and risk management Solutions are collaborating closely, banking on their conviction that single-event attribution will get faster and better. and it is. this year, allen's team was able to tackle the sort of question that had once taken them a decade to answer, coming up with a meaningful risk assessment in just one month. they were able to say that climate change increased the risk of a recent flood by 25 percent. that's not quite real-time evaluation of the role of climate change in natural disasters, but it's getting damned close. in the meantime, allen's work can help improve the conversation about climate change by making clearer exactly how climate change affects us-and how it doesn't. \"it's important to manage expectations,\" he said. \"One of the more interesting consequences of getting a bit more scientific is that we find attribution is more or less evenly split between positive and negative results.

You could go to Weatherbill's website and buy a custom policy. early on, however, Friedberg and Khaliq realized that the big opportunity lay in agriculture. unpredictable weather has been a bane to farmers ever since they first planted wheat and barley in the Fertile Crescent. But now climate change has amped up the risk. \"the most pronounced change isn't slow rise of temperatures over many years,\" Friedberg says. \"it's the size of the variance year to year and the lack of predictability. a farmer isn't thinking, 'Okay, it's going to be 1.3 degrees warmer in a few decades.' He's wondering whether it's going to be dry or wet, and how much corn he's going to get. How much seed to plant? it's becoming impossible to predict.\" So great was the need-and the market-for risk management in agriculture that it gradually became the company's sole focus. in 2011, the company changed its name to the Climate Corporation and adopted the lofty mission \"to help all the world's people and businesses manage and adapt to climate change.\" Friedberg, raised in Los angeles, far from farms and farmers, and schooled in astrophysics at Berkeley, was reinventing crop insurance by bringing the a decade ago, when David friedberg was in his 20s and a product manager at Google, his daily commute took him past a bike-rental business on San Francisco's embarcadero.

Disaster politics had (amazingly!) worked. a 2013 Government accountability Office analysis of Biggert-Waters indicated that nationally about eight percent of nFiP customers would see immediate rate increases and another 13 percent of customers would likely see them in the near future; these would be the policyholders in the highest-risk areas, who absorb the largest share of federal subsidies. afraid of rising flood insurance costs, they made their voices heard, and their representatives in Congress listened. the minute Biggert-Waters became law, a determined and bipartisan coalition of legislators led by Louisiana Senator mary Landrieu set out to roll it back. Landrieu, locked in a tight re-election contest, picked on provisions in the bill intended to bring premiums into line with the real costs of flood insurance in risky flood zones.

Flame retardants save lives, but they have also come with a sizeable environmental and human health cost. the chemicals in conventional flame retardants have been linked to early puberty in girls as well as to cancer, low birth weight, and infertility. the chemicals can also enter the environment through wastewater, where they accumulate in aquatic sediments and the tissues of wildlife. traces have been found in animals around the world, from polar bears in the arctic to penguins and sea sponges in the antarctic, and the toxins may alter hormones of affected creatures. researchers from italy's Polytechnic university of turin began their search for a more eco-friendly alternative in the dairy aisle. they knew caseins, like conventional flame retardants, are high in phosphorus. So they tried coating three types of materials-cotton, polyester, and a 65/35 polyester-cotton blend-with cheap, plentiful caseins from italy's productive cheese industry.

When converting plants to fuels, engineers must remove lignin, a key component of wood, to get to the sugary cellulose that's fermented into energy-rich compounds. this is costly because it normally requires high temperatures and caustic chemicals. now, researchers in the u.S. and Canada have modified the lignin in poplar trees to self-destruct under mild processing conditions-a trick that could slash the cost of turning plant biomass into biofuels. more than two-thirds of plant matter consists of cellulose and hemicellulose fibers, both made up of long",

Plant biologists have tried for decades to work around the troubles with lignin. One early approach decreased the expression of plants' lignin-producing genes. But that backfired, as the plants either wound up with stunted growth or keeled over when hit with a gust of wind. \"Plants really need lignin,\" says John ralph, a plant biochemist at the university of Wisconsin, madison. Other teams have manipulated plant genes to change the proportions of lignin's main building blocks, hoping to create a substance that degrades more easily. ralph and his colleagues opted for another path. instead of altering the proportions of lignin building blocks, they added a new one that makes it easier for them to later \"unzip\" the lignin's structure during pretreatment.",

Bugs were just something fun and animate to play with: i kept caterpillars, feeding them fresh leaves and cleaning their jars every few days, nourishing them to moth-hood. at the same time, with no sense of contradiction, i spent entire summer vacation mornings killing ants, spraying them with window cleaner, setting them on fire, or coaxing them to fight in bottles.",

Quite a few guys i've known can relate similar stories. magnifying glasses are a fairly universal feature. these days i don't much like to think of those ant-massacring mornings, but i did after reading about Backyard Brains, a Kickstarter-funded \u00a9Backyard Brains to think about and treat other living beings. there's no bright line, at least not then, between empathizing with animals and with people. i'm thankful that, in the end, my caterpillar-caring side prevailed over my ant-frying tendencies, and wonder if the instructive virtue of empathizing with insects might outweigh whatever educational gains can be had from steering them with an iPhone. a note on the company's website does reassure customers that, though it's unknown if insects feel pain, anesthesia is used during procedures on cockroaches, and also on earthworms and grasshoppers involved in other experiments. this question of pain is an interesting one, and it opens up its own can of worms: as philosophers and scientists usually define the term, pain is intertwined with emotion, which in turn is intertwined with consciousness. You can't experience pain unless there's a you-a sense of self, an interior dialogue beyond the interplay of stimulus and involuntary response, elevating mechanics to consciousness.",

Groups decide collectively on where to feed and shelter, and there's evidence of sophisticated communication, via chemical signals rather than dances. When kept in isolation, individual roaches develop behavioral disorders; they possess rich spatial memories, which they use to navigate; and they might even recognize group members on an individual basis.

Let students do this sort of research, and leave the roboroaching and leg-cutting to those with an active interest in neuroscience, if only because cockroaches just might, however improbably, be happier that way. and to those who still consider that view soft-hearted and perhaps soft-headed, i offer this: according to Gage, remote-controlled roaches respond to commands only for a while. after that, they ignore the signals. as best as we can tell, they go where they want to go. \u2022 Brandon Keim is a freelance journalist specializing in science, environment, and culture.
