            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is perennially one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Effective therapy and vaccination are needed to control viral expansion. However, current anti-IAV drugs risk inducing drug-resistant virus emergence. Although intranasal administration of whole inactivated virus vaccine can induce efficient protective immunity, formalin and \u03b2-propiolactone are the currently used and harmful inactivating agents. Here, we analyzed the antiviral activity of hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) tea extract against human IAV and evaluated its potential as a novel anti-IAV drug and a safe inactivating agent for whole inactivated vaccine. The in vitro study revealed that the pH of hibiscus tea extract is acidic, and its rapid and potent antiviral activity relied largely on the acidic pH. Furthermore, the mouse study showed that the acidic extract was not effective for either therapeutic or vaccination purposes. However, hibiscus tea extract and protocatechuic acid, one of the major components of the extract, showed not only potent acid-dependent antiviral activity but also weak low-pHindependent activity. The low-pH-independent activity did not affect the conformation of immunodominant hemagglutinin protein. Although this low-pH-independent activity is very limited, it may be suitable for the application to medication and vaccination because this activity is not affected by the neutral blood environment and does not lose antigenicity of hemagglutinin. Further study of the low-pH-independent antiviral mechanism and attempts to enhance the antiviral activity may establish a novel anti-IAV therapy and vaccination strategy.",

Non-vaccinated mice receiving PBS served as a control group. Non-vaccinated mice rapidly lost body weight after the viral inoculation, and all mice in the group died by day 7. On the other hand, the body weight in the formalin-and \u03b2-PL-treated groups did not change, and all the mice survived until day 14. The mice lost body weight in the Hib[crude]-treated group, but the degree of weight loss was ameliorated compared to the non-vaccinated group. The vaccine efficacy was much lower in the Hib[crude]-treated group, but the survival rate was significantly improved (Fig. 5b, c) . The HI-active Ab titer in serum was also measured pre-inoculation on day 0 and postinoculation on day 14. Prior to inoculation, the HI titers were below the detection limit in all non-vaccinated mice, but the titers were in the range of 2 9 to 2 12 in the formalin and . The pH of each aqueous solution was adjusted to acidic or approximately neutral. The pH shown was an approximate value with a range \u00b1 0.3. The mixture was placed at 26 \u00b0C for 10 min or 48 h and mixed with an equal volume of chicken blood cells. HA titer of the mixture was evaluated after a 30-min reaction. Error bars indicate mean \u00b1 SD; n = 3 to 6 per group. Student's t test with Bonferroni's test (a), and Student's t test (b) were performed to analyze statistical significance. The results represent more than two independent experiments 1 3 \u03b2-PL groups. In the Hib[crude] group, the titers were less than 2 5 in all mice and below the detection limit in two mice (Fig. 5d) . Although the HI titers were low in the Hib[crude] group, the HI-positive mice survived until day 14 (data not shown). Post-inoculation HI titer did not differ from the preinoculation titer in the formalin and \u03b2-PL groups. In the Hib[crude] group, the HI titer increased to the same level as the formalin and \u03b2-PL groups (Fig. 5d) . These results indicate that formalin-and \u03b2-PL-inactivated vaccine completely prevented viral infection, but acidic Hib[crude]-inactivated vaccine did not prevent infection. The viral particle structure integrity in the whole inactivated vaccine relates to protective activity against IAV infection. We assessed whether the conformation of hemagglutinin (HAin) was preserved in each vaccine using the HA assay. HA activity of IAV is lost by a change in HAin conformation (Sriwilaijaroen and Suzuki 2012) . Intact (untreated) or inactivated PR8 virus was mixed with chicken blood cells and the HA titer was measured. The HA titer of acidic Hib[crude]-treated PR8 virus was below the detection limit, but the HA titer of formalin-and \u03b2-PL-treated PR8 virus was similar to the intact PR8 virus (Fig. 5e) .

            "text": "Earlier studies indicated that the extract derived from Hibiscus sabdariffa L. calyces has antiviral activity against the H5 subtype of highly pathogenic and low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses, herpes simplex virus-2, feline calicivirus, murine norovirus-1, hepatitis A virus, and Aichi virus (Baatartsogt et al. 2016; D'Souza et al. 2016; Hassan et al. 2017; Joshi et al. 2015) . Moreover, the leaves of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. also showed anti-measles virus activity (Sunday et al. 2010 ). However, antiviral activity mechanism against these viruses is still unclear. Since many acidic compounds in hibiscus calyces contribute to the low pH, we focused on correlating anti-PR8 viral activity and the acidic pH of hibiscus tea components. We found that not only Hib[crude] but also PBS of pH \u2264 4.0 potently inactivated PR8 virus in a short period of time (10 min) (Fig. 1) . This finding indicates that the anti-PR8 virus activity of hibiscus tea extract is largely dependent on acid. However, we could not deny a possibility that there are unknown antiviral compounds which show its activity only in the acidic condition. This unknown mechanism might partially contribute to the viral inactivation. We further analyzed the anti-PR8 virus activity of PCA, ferulic acid, and hibiscus acid, which are all components of hibiscus tea extract. In the previous reports, PCA showed antiviral activity against feline calicivirus, murine norovirus-1, and herpes simplex virus-2 (Hassan et al. 2017; Joshi et al. 2015) . Ferulic acid showed antiviral activity against feline calicivirus and murine norovirus-1 (Joshi et al. 2015) . Here, acidic PCA and hibiscus acid showed anti-PR8 virus activity. Non-pH-adjusted ferulic acid solution with a relatively higher pH (pH 6.5) did not inactivate PR8 virus. When the IAV particle is exposed to acidic pH conditions, viral HAin changes its conformation and irreversibly loses binding affinity for sialic acid (Quan et al. 2011; Sriwilaijaroen and Suzuki 2012) .",

Many IAV strains are susceptible to acid, but the degree of sensitivity varies between strains (Puri et al. 1990; Ruigrok et al. 1984) .

Although acidic Hib[crude] and frHibis inactivated highly pathogenic and low-pathogenic avian H5 influenza viruses in 10 min in our previous study (Baatartsogt et al. 2016) , we have yet to determine whether all potent and rapid antiviral activity against these H5 viral strains is completely acid dependent.",

Since PCA accounts for 24% of Hibiscus sabdariffa water extract (Da-Costa-Rocha et al. 2014), a major part of the anti-PR8 virus activities of neutral hibiscus extract may be due to PCA. In addition, frHibis also contains abundant bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds (Da-Costa-Rocha et al. 2014) . Several studies reported that polyphenol-rich plant extracts and plant-derived phenolic compounds have anti-IAV activities (Droebner et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2013; Yamada et al. 2009 ). These phenolic compounds in frHibis may also contribute to antiviral activity. An attempt to identify the mechanism of low-pH-independent anti-PR8 virus activity of PCA and to search for other low-pH-independent anti-PR8 virus constituents is currently ongoing.",

In the case of p.o. administration, Hib[crude] is first absorbed from the digestive tract and distributed into systemic blood. Subsequently, it reaches the respiratory organs where IAV resides. The neutralized Hib[crude] in the blood loses potent anti-IAV activity due to acid, and the low-pH-independent antiviral activity is inadequate to inactivate virus in vivo. The low content, weak antiviral activity, and short biological half-life of low-pH-independent anti-IAV compounds in Hib[crude] could contribute to therapeutic failure. To achieve a successful p.o. administration therapy using hibiscus tea components such as PCA, it would be necessary to chemically modify them to extend their biological half-life and enhance antiviral activity or use them in combination with a carrier to retain them in blood.",

We previously showed that i.n. co-administration of innate immune receptor adjuvants with split vaccine efficiently induced both systemic and mucosal anti-IAV immunity (Takaki et al. , 2017 Takeda et al. 2018 ). On the other hand, whole inactivated vaccine comprises viral structural components with immune priming activity like immunostimulatory viral RNA. We assessed the utility of acidic Hib[crude] as a safe inactivating agent for whole-virus vaccine. However, unlike the viruses inactivated by formalin and \u03b2-PL, the viruses inactivated by acidic Hib[crude] failed to induce efficient protective immunity (Fig. 5) . As shown in other reports (Pawar et al. 2015) , formalin-and \u03b2-PL-treated virus but not acidic Hib[crude] showed intact HA activity (Fig. 5e ). HAin is an immunodominant protein (Kaminski and Lee 2011; Liu et al. 2018; Sautto et al. 2018) . The acidic pH of Hib[crude] could cause the loss of antigenicity by inducing a change in HAin conformation. These results show that the acidic hibiscus components cannot be used as inactivating agents for vaccine preparation. On the other hand, low-pH-independent activity of frHibis and PCA which does not affect HAin conformation is suitable for vaccine application. However, these weak virucidal effects have not yet been sufficient for use as an inactivating agent. Further study of the low-pH-independent anti-IAV mechanism and enhancement of its antiviral activity may contribute to IAV vaccine strategy development.",

This acidic extract is not suitable for use in therapeutics and vaccine development. However, frHibis and PCA were found to have weak low-pH-independent anti-PR8 virus activity, which does not affect HAin conformation. Hence, further study of low-pH-independent antiviral compounds may enable us to establish a novel anti-IAV therapy and vaccination strategy.",
