However, these methods for disease detection focus exclusively on improving the accuracy of classification or predictions without quantifying uncertainty in a decision. Knowing how much confidence there is in a computer-based medical diagnosis is essential for gaining clinicians' trust in the technology and therefore improve treatment. Today, the 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) infections are a major healthcare challenge around the world. Detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images is crucial for diagnosis, assessment and treatment. However, diagnostic uncertainty in a report is a challenging yet inevitable task for radiologists. In this paper, we investigate how Dropweights based Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) can estimate uncertainty in Deep Learning solutions to improve the diagnostic performance of the human-machine combination using publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset and show that the uncertainty in prediction is strongly correlated with the accuracy of the prediction. We believe that the availability of uncertainty-aware deep learning will enable a wider adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a clinical setting.",

However, despite the promising results, deep learning for classification tasks lacks the ability to say \"I don't know\" in an ambiguous or unknown case. Hence, it is critical to estimate uncertainty in medical imaging as an additional insight to point predictions to improve the reliability in making decisions.",

We introduced fully connected layers on top of the ResNet50V2 convolutional base.

The class with the highest softmax output for predictive distribution mean is considered as the prediction and the predictive entropy of the output distributions (measured as in Equation (3)) as the estimated epistemic uncertainty. Based on the input image, a network can be certain with high or low confidence about its decision, indicated by the predictive posterior distribution. The wider the output posterior distributions, the less confident is the model in it's prediction. This is because the uncertainty in weight space captured by the posterior is incorporated into the predictive uncertainty, giving us a way to model to say \"I don't know\". Figure 1(a) shows a correctly classified image where the model is highly certain about its prediction (PH=0.0086).

The table below shows the effect of variation of the dropweights rate, p, to the uncertainty measures. It shows that the estimated uncertainty is higher for erroneous predictions. Therefore, uncertainty information provides as an additional insight to point prediction to refer the uncertain images to radiologists for further investigation [14] , which improves the overall prediction performance. Figure 4 shows the effect of variation of the Dropweights rate p to the uncertainty measures (PH and BALD). The results suggest, that predictive entropy as a measure of uncertainty is a better measure for uncertainty and should be considered over BALD. Regardless of values for the number of MC samples and Dropweights rate, we can observe a higher uncertainty for incorrect classification. MC dropweights for uncertainty estimation can usually be used in every image classifier to improve prediction accuracy of man-machine combination via uncertainty-aware referral with the additional computational load cost of performing multiple forward passes.
