Over the last 10 years, a considerable amount of work has uncovered the molecular determinants of replication fidelity in this enzyme. The isolation of high-and low-fidelity variants for several RNA viruses, in an expanding number of viral families, provides evidence that nature has optimized the fidelity to facilitate genetic diversity and adaptation, while maintaining genetic integrity and infectivity.

As calculated by Drake et al. (1998) , Drake and Holland (1999) , even the comparatively modest retroviruses, generating 0.1 mutations per genome per replication cycle, lead to enormous variation in viral progeny. RNA virus mutation rates are therefore magnitudes higher than DNA organisms, such as Escherichia coli (0.0025) or Saccharomyces cerevisiae (0.0027). This is in large part due to the lack of proofreading mechanisms in their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Are mutation rates fixed for a given organism? High-and low-fidelity variants in E. coli and yeast were already described as early as the 1970s (Flury et al. 1976; Gillin and Nossal 1976) . Three principal mechanisms contribute to fidelity in E. coli: intrinsic polymerase fidelity (how many correct versus incorrect nucleotides are incorporated), exonuclease proofreading activity, and DNA mismatch repair (Schaaper 1993) . These mechanisms can be altered to obtain variants with altered replication fidelity. Interestingly, work in E. coli also suggested that mutation rates in a given organism are not fixed, but are dynamic. For instance, at least one percent of natural isolates are mutator variants (Jyssum 1960; Gross and Siegel 1981; LeClerc et al. 1996) . Remarkably, by passaging E. coli for 10,000 generations in a limited glucose environment, Sniegowski et al. (1997) showed that some bacterial populations develop mutation rates one-or twofold higher than wild type, suggesting that in fluctuating environments mutator alleles are potentially beneficial (Taddei et al. 1997) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 75, "end": 94, "text": "Drake et al.

The incorporation of ribavirin directly into nascent genomes during poliovirus replication results in transition mutations, principally A \u2192 G, G \u2192 A or C \u2192 U, with detrimental effects to the virus. Sequencing of the polymerase gene of the ribavirin-resistant population revealed one amino acid change, G64S. It was hypothesized that resistance was due to (a) a more active polymerase, simply generating more progeny genomes permitting better survival; (b) a polymerase that no longer recognized ribavirin as a base analog; or (c) an overall increase in polymerase fidelity and selection of the correct nucleotide. Several observations supported this last mechanism: G64S exhibited the same replication as wild-type virus in single-cycle infections; G64S generated fewer escape mutants to antiviral compounds; and G64S was also resistant to base analogs of different structure (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard 2003; Vignuzzi et al. 2006) . In parallel, a biochemical study confirmed that G64S was a high-fidelity enzyme by directly demonstrating that the rate of incorrect nucleotide incorporation was fourfold lower than wild type (Arnold et al. 2005) , and direct sequencing of genomes revealed that the mutation frequency was sixfold lower in the G64S population (Vignuzzi et al. 2006) .

Coxsackie virus B3, also from the Picornaviridae family, was treated with moderate concentrations of ribavirin or 5-azacytidine (5-AZC, another RNA mutagen). Within 10-20 passages, a new mutation, A372V, arose in the RdRp. This mutation alone conferred resistance to the effects of three RNA mutagens at high concentrations, and its increased fidelity was confirmed by sequencing and biochemical assays (Levi et al. 2010) . Guided by the high-fidelity poliovirus studies, identified G64R and G64T as ribavirin-resistant variants of human enterovirus 71 (HEV71). Although altered growth kinetics make results more difficult to interpret, at least one variant, G64R, was a bona fide antimutator. In addition, serial passaging of HEV71 in ribavirin led to another mutation in the RdRp, S264L, that conferred resistance and increased fidelity . Recently, another group found a mutation in the HEV71 RdRp, L123F, that increased fidelity (Meng and Kwang 2014) . Finally, a high-fidelity polymerase variant was found for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV, also in the Picornaviridae family), selected by serial passage in the RNA mutagen, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).

Further passage of M296I in ribavirin resulted in selection of a triple mutant, M296I:P44S:P169S, that was resistant to ribavirin without acquiring resistance to other mutagens such as 5-FU . Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that these variants specifically resist ribavirin incorporation during RNA synthesis.

Generally, one would expect mutagen sensitivity, rather than resistance, to be a hallmark of low fidelity.

In one case, influenza viruses with mutator phenotypes were isolated by selecting for escape variants by single plaque transfers during sequential treatment with monoclonal antibodies (Su\u00e1rez et al. 1992 ). This work preceded other studies of RdRp fidelity by over a decade and did not go further to confirm whether the mutator status mapped to the polymerase genes. For the most part, low-fidelity RdRp variants have been identified by performing site-directed mutagenesis on targeted residues near the catalytic site.

A more recent study targeted residues in Coxsackie virus B3 based on their implication in the closely related poliovirus fidelity network and on predicted polymerase structure during catalysis (Arnold et al. 2005; Gong and Peersen 2010) . Nine lower fidelity variants were isolated that presented elevated mutation frequencies (Fig. 1a ). For FMDV, 5 low-fidelity variants were recently shown to increase mutation frequencies and render the variants more susceptible to mutagenesis . In order to obtain low-fidelity variants for chikungunya virus, all possible amino acids were swapped into polymerase position 483, which was previously shown to result in a high-fidelity enzyme (C483Y) (Rozen-Gagnon et al. 2014) (Fig. 1b) . Three variants proved to be low-fidelity: C483A, C483G, and C483W.

However, the phenotypic and genotypic assays used to discriminate between these fidelity changes may not be sensitive enough to detect subtle differences among natural isolates. Furthermore, given the quasispecies nature of RNA virus populations, it is not known whether fidelity variants exist at low frequencies within the mutant spectrum and whether they would modulate overall population fidelity. For instance, Coxsackie virus B3 mutator strains that presented mutation frequencies nearer to wild-type values did not display attenuated phenotypes ). This raises the possibility that slightly elevated mutation rates could be advantageous in conditions that require more rapid adaptation. Interestingly, the A372V and S299T Coxsackie virus variants, respectively, presenting moderately higher and lower fidelities, exist as natural isolates. Threonine at position 299 is found in 5 % of the isolates, while valine at position 372 is found in 86 % (Harrison et al. 2008) . It is thus possible that at any given time, a RNA virus quasispecies contains a subpopulation of mutators and antimutators, whose frequencies may fluctuate when environmental pressures require more rapid evolution or better maintenance of genetic integrity. Importantly, the study of fidelity variants in tissue culture has been nearly exclusively performed in highly permissible, immortalized cell lines during only a few replication cycles. Recent studies show that the mutation rates and frequencies of viruses can dramatically change depending on cell type (Rozen-Gagnon et al. 2014; Combe and Sanjuan 2014) . Therefore, under more stringent selective pressures, the fidelity of RNA viruses may be adjusted. Indeed, evolution of mutation rates has been observed in bacteria during colonization in vivo or in conditions of starvation (Sniegowski et al. 1997) .

Indeed, most RNA virus fidelity variants isolated have contained mutations in the RdRp (the only exceptions thus far have been the mutator coronaviruses lacking exonuclease activity) (Eckerle et al. 2007 (Eckerle et al. , 2010 . The RdRp has a structure conserved across virus families. RdRp structures have been solved for members of the Flaviviridae, including hepatitis C virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and dengue virus (Lu and Gong 2013; Yap et al. 2007; Malet et al. 2007; Choi et al. 2004; Bressanelli et al. 1999; Lesburg et al. 1999) ; the Calciviridaie, including rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, Norwalk virus, sapovirus, reovirus \u03bb3, and bacteriophage \u03d56 (Ng et al. 2002 (Ng et al. , 2004 Fullerton et al. 2007; Butcher et al. 2001; Salgado et al. 2004; Tao et al. 2002) ; the Picornaviridae, including Coxsackie virus B3, poliovirus, FMDV, HEV71, human rhinovirus, and encephalomyocarditis virus (Chen et al. 2013; Gruez et al. 2008; Love et al. 2004; Ferrer-Orta 2004; Appleby et al. 2005 ; Thompson and Peersen 2004; Hansen et al. 1997; Vives-Adrian et al. 2014) ; the Birnaviridae, including infectious bursal disease virus (Pan et al. 2007) ; and the Orthomyxoviridae, including influenza A virus (He et al. 2008) . All these polymerases have a \"right-handed\" architecture, which is comprised of finger, palm, and thumb domains. The RdRps exist in a closed hand formation, accomplished by connections between the finger and thumb domains [for review see (Ferrer-Orta et al. 2006; Ng et al. 2008) ]. Loops extending from the fingers (fingertips) surround the active site and create the entrance to the template channel, where template recognition occurs (Butcher et al. 2001; Ferrer-Orta 2004; O'Farrell et al. 2003) . The template channel itself connects the fingers to the active site, located in the palm. The palm is made up of a three-stranded \u03b2-sheet and 3 \u03b1-helices and is a highly conserved feature. This catalytic domain contains 7 conserved motifs (A-G) present in all RdRps thus far, which catalyze the nucleotidyl transfer reaction. The enzymatic function relies on a two-metal-ion mechanism proposed for all polymerases. This mechanism was first shown for RdRps using the poliovirus RdRp (Ng et al. 2008; Steitz 1998; Arnold et al. 1999) . The incoming nucleotide enters the active site with metal ion B, which orients the NTP in the active site using the \u03b2and \u03b3-phosphates of the NTP and a conserved aspartic acid (Asp) in motif A. Following this, metal ion A binds the \u03b1-phosphate group of the NTP, the Asp of motif A, and another conserved Asp in motif C. In addition, metal ion A binds the 3\u2032-OH of the nascent RNA strand, lowering the 3\u2032-OH affinity for the H to allow nucleophilic attach of the NTP \u03b1-phosphate (Ng et al. 2008; Steitz 1998) . Therefore, two protons are transferred during this reaction (Castro et al. 2007 ): one from the nascent RNA 3\u2032-OH to an unknown acceptor and one to the pyrophosphate (PPi) leaving group from a general acid, usually a lysine, in Motif D (Castro et al. 2009; Cameron et al. 2009 ).

This is not necessarily surprising; given that a single-nucleotide incorporation cycle is cell-free solution is not equivalent to a complete viral life cycle within infected cells (including binding, entry, replication, packaging, and egress).

Although major growth defects are generally not observed in vitro, in vivo attenuation seems to be the general rule for fidelity variants (Fig. 3) . The precedent for in vivo attenuation was set with the G64S poliovirus high-fidelity variant. Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard (2005) demonstrated that G64S was less pathogenic than wild-type virus in mice, despite not finding significant replication differences in vitro. Vignuzzi et al. (2006) also demonstrated an attenuated phenotype for G64S, where the 50 % lethal dose (LD 50 ) in mice was 300-fold higher than in wild type. Furthermore, while both virus populations could colonize and infect spleens, kidneys, muscles, and intestines when a systemic inoculation was performed, G64S was unable to disseminate more distally to infect the CNS or to be shed in feces. Sequencing of individual genomes from the high-fidelity population in vivo confirmed its restricted genetic diversity. In this study, the restricted quasispecies of G64S was artificially expanded by mutagen treatment to present the same number of mutations as wild type. Importantly, the expanded G64S population (G64S eQS ) recovered the ability to infect and colonize the spinal cord and brain and had a similar lethal dose compared to wild type. Furthermore, coinfections of a restricted G64S population with either wild type or G64S eQS allowed the genetically restricted G64S population to invade the spinal cord and brain. This seminal work provided strong evidence that not only consensus changes impact virulence and pathogenesis, but that mutant spectrum complexity can also be critical to pathogenesis and/or virus survival in vivo (although this is not always the case). This study also provided Fig. 3 Schematic depicting the effects of viral diversity, due to viral polymerase fidelity changes, on mutagenic drug resistance and attenuation in vivo. The numbers in the viral diversity schematic are arbitrary illustrations meant to represent genetically inter-connected progeny genomes, comprising populations with low, normal, and high degrees of diversity indirect evidence that cooperative interactions within the quasispecies may play a role in virus infection and disease progression.

LAVs have proven more efficacious than subunit vaccine counterparts, but pose safety concerns [for review see (Lauring et al. 2010) ]. One principal concern in LAVs is reversion to virulence, which has been observed for a number of LAVs, including the Sabin strains of poliovirus (Cann et al. 1984) . While mutator strains raise the question of safety and stability as LAVs because they generate more mutations than wild-type viruses, the SARS-CoV ExoN mutator was shown to remain stable in mouse models. Likewise, when the ExoN mutator was allowed to establish a persistent infection in SCID mice for up to 30 days, no reversion was detected at inactivated exonuclease sites. Interestingly, one of the attenuating mutations present in the RdRp of the Sabin strain of poliovirus was shown to decrease fidelity. This raises the possibility that in currently used vaccines, attenuation is already achieved in part by altering the natural fidelity of an RNA virus (although whether the strain including all attenuating mutations retains this lower fidelity has not been shown) (Liu et al. 2013 ). In addition, the high-fidelity G64S/A/V/T/L polioviruses passaged in mice did not revert at position 64 and remained attenuated. For LAV development high-fidelity variants may be of particular interest, since lowered mutation frequencies make mutations conferring virulence less likely to occur. Indeed, under selective pressure to revert in vivo, high-fidelity variants were less able to do so, whereas the wild-type virus quickly reverted at a significantly higher number of sites (Vignuzzi et al. 2008) . Since fidelity-altering mutations map to single or few residues, combining these with other conventional attenuating mutations may be a good strategy to further reduce reversion to virulence.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 755, "end": 777, "text": "(Vignuzzi et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1194, "text": "(Graham et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1328, "text": "(Lauring et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1477, "end": 1495, "text": "(Cann et al. 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2271, "end": 2287, "text": "(Liu et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2774, "end": 2796, "text": "(Vignuzzi et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Fidelity Variants as Vaccine Candidates"}, {"text": "Viruses appear to have fine-tuned their mutation rate in order to maximize adaptation, while at the same time maintaining genomic integrity. Deviation from these optimized mutation rates have been shown to be attenuating. The proposed explanation for the observed attenuation is mutational meltdown, losing the ability to maintain genetic information due to the extrinsic increase in mutation rates (Eigen 1971; Domingo et al. 2005) . Importantly, a consequence of the study of lethal mutagenesis as an antiviral approach was the discovery of the high-fidelity variants, which generally were more resistant to mutation-inducing drugs. This discovery further boosted interest in determining how viral mutation rates could be modulated intrinsically, leading to the isolation of more fidelity variants. Large panels of high-and low-fidelity variants are now available to feedback into the research on lethal mutagenesis as an antiviral approach: Due to their altered sensitivity to such compounds, they are excellent tools to investigate the mutagenic activities of known compounds or identify new mutagenic compounds. Indeed, the first high-and low-fidelity variants of Coxsackie virus B3 were key in identifying a previously unknown mutagenic activity for amiloride compounds (Levi et al. 2010) . Similar screens using compound libraries may thus identify other classes of antivirals with mutagenic effects (Table 1) .
