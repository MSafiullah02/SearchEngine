In 2012, Gamache found that 69 (44.5%) of 155 second opinion patients that he had seen over a 14-month period were told by outside spine surgeons that they needed surgery, which he considered unnecessary.[3] In 2013, Epstein evaluated 183 patients who were told by their first-opinion spine surgeons that they needed spine surgery.[2] In her opinion, 60.7% required no surgery, 33.3% were about to undergo the wrong or exceedingly extensive operations, while only 6% were offered the \u201cright\u201d operation. In a 2014 article entitled \u201cNecessary or unnecessary? a critical glance on spine surgery\u201d, Raabe et al. noted: \u201cPatients with complaints and symptoms caused by spinal degenerative diseases demonstrate a high rate of spontaneous improvement.\u201d[5] We can debate the degree to which unnecessary surgery occurs, but the fact remains, it does exist.",

            "text": "Patients are increasingly being offered too extensive or insufficiently extensive minimally invasive spine operations that increase perioperative risks.[1,2,6] In Transfeldt et al.\u2019s study (2010) the risks/ complications increased for more extensive spine operations; they noted a 10% complication rate for decompressive laminectomies alone, a 40% rate for decompressions with limited fusion (1-2 level), and a 56% rate for multilevel full-curve fusions.[6] On the other hand, insufficiently extensive minimally invasive spine procedures, by providing inadequate exposure, also increased perioperative risks: more neurological injuries/deficits, spinal fluid leaks, residual pathology, and/or higher infection rates.[1,2] Further, it is well documented that instrumented spinal fusions have markedly increased, particularly in patients age 65 and older.[1,4] In 2010, Marawar et al., utilizing The National Hospital Discharge Survey from 1990 to 2004, observed a 28-fold increase in anterior discectomy and fusion (ADF) in patients over age 65.[4] Watt\u2019s observed in 2014 \u201c\u2026a 15-fold increase in complex spinal fusions for spinal stenosis \u2026 between 2002 and 2007.\u201d[7] Again, there is little doubt that some patients are being offered too extensive or insufficiently extensive minimally invasive spine operations that increase perioperative risks.",
