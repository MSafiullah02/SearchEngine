            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was one of the most serious epidemic diseases in 2003 and is still a threat to the public health worldwide (1). A specific SARS coronavirus (CoV) was identified to be the contagious agent. Maturation of the SARS-CoV involves proteolytic processing of the virus polyproteins by the chymotrypsin-like main protease (3CLpro) and a papain-like protease (PLpro). SARS-CoV might invade cells by a protease-mediated endosomal pathway (2). Any knowledge about the structural stability of viral protease can be very rewarding for the development of antivirus drugs (3\u20136).",

As had previously been shown for the 3CLpro of transmissible gastroenteritis (corona)virus (9), the SARS-CoV enzyme also exists as a dimer in solution and in crystals, with each subunit containing three structural domains (Fig. 1). The catalytic dyad His41-Cys145 is located between the interfaces of domains I (residues 8\u201399) and domain II (residues 100\u2013183), which constitute the chymotrypsin-like folding scaffold. This catalytic N-terminal domain is connected by a long loop (residues 184\u2013199) to the helical domain III (residues 200\u2013306). The functional role of the extra C-terminal domain III is less clear. Numerous experimental evidence shows the importance of N- and C-terminal residues in the dimerization (4,10\u201312). Structural studies indicate the close proximity of C-terminus and N-finger (N-terminal residues 1\u20137) (9) from subunit A to the active site of subunit B that led to the development of a novel autocleavage mechanism that can explain the dimeric nature of the mature enzyme (13).

In a recent article, Chen et al. (21) confirmed that the dimeric SARS-CoV main protease is asymmetric and only one protomer is active at a time. They proposed a novel association-activation-catalysis-dissociation mechanism for the enzyme activity control. We checked whether dissociation is the major reason for enzyme inactivation. The following residues were selected for analysis: His41 and Cys145, the catalytic dyad; His163, the substrate-binding residue; Tyr161, residue for holding His163 in place. Some surface residues at domain I, Ser65 and Asn84, were also selected as control. In the Ramachandran plot (22), Asn84 is in the disallowed region of the unbound 3CLpro but in a generously allowed region of a 3CLpro-azapeptide inhibitor complex (23). Table 1 summarizes the kinetic parameters of these mutants. Mutation at catalytic dyad residues (H41A and C145A) abolishes almost the complete biological function while the enzyme exists exclusively as dimer. Assuming that the rate-limiting step of the hydrolytic activity of 3CLpro, like chymotrypsin, is at the covalent acylation-deacylation step, then the Km value for the substrate reflects an apparent binding affinity for the enzyme-substrate complex. However, mutation at S1 site (H163A) of the substrate-binding pocket did not change the substrate binding appreciably as anticipated. The major effect was on the kcat value. H163A possessed \u223c0.1% of enzyme activity compared with WT. In contrast, the catalytic dyad mutants, H41A and C145A, had only 10\u22126 relative activity left.  ",

Thus Cys145 and His163 have been mutated in 3CLpro of transmissible gastroenteritis (corona) virus (9); His41, Cys145, Tyr161 in feline infectious peritonitis virus (28); and Cys145 in SARS-CoV (10,13,29). Table 1 summarizes the results obtained in this study. As expected, the almost complete loss of enzymatic activity of H41A and C145A confirmed the catalytic roles of the catalytic dyad (29,30). Similar observations were made for His163 and Tyr161. Both of these residues are involved in substrate binding. The main function of Tyr161 is to hold His163 in place. Mutation of His163 led to a relatively small increase in Km but a large drop in kcat (Table 1). This could result from the enzyme activity assays being performed at pH 7.6, where one protomer of the dimeric enzyme adopts a different conformation from that in acidic environment (7). It has been postulated by Tan et al. (30) and also by Yang et al. (7) that at low pH, protonation of His163 induces a series of conformational changes that lead to the collapse of the oxyanion hole and blocks the S1 pocket entry. This would be in full agreement with the observation of a very large decrease in kcat as shown in Table 1. An intriguing question will then be testing the pH-activity profile of H163A mutant to confirm that His163 is responsible for the lower activity of 3CLpro at pH 6.0 as predicted by molecular dynamic simulation (30).",

            "text": "Bacha et al. (24) had demonstrated the intrinsic instability of the C-terminal domain III by differential scanning calorimetry albeit this technique seemingly does not provide enough resolution to detect the unfolding intermediate. We observed a clear biphasic unfolding curve for the 3CLpro by the protein intrinsic fluorescence. The intermediate form was assigned to a folded C-terminal domain but an unfolded N-terminal domain on the basis of the following observations: a), Our unfolding data of 3CLpro clearly demonstrate the biphasic-unfolding process and our data of 3CLI+II (N-terminal domain) suggest attributing the first and second phases of the 3CLpro to the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively (Table 2). b), Unequivocal assignment of the biphasic unfolding curve to differential domain stability came from results shown in Fig. 7. The W31 and W207/W218 are full-length 3CLpro. The unfolding curves shown in Fig. 7 should be biphasic. However, because the protein was excited with 295 nm UV light, one of the domain unfoldings is invisible and the unfolding curve only registered the structural changes of the tryptophan-containing domain. W31 and W207/W218 thus report conformational changes of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, respectively. It is then clear that the N-terminal domain is labile than the C-terminal domain. The stabilization of the catalytic N-terminal domain by the C-terminal domain III is thus confirmed. The intrinsic conformational stability of domain (I+II) without domain III has a much higher free energy (7.27 kcal mol\u22121) than full-length 3CLpro (1.22 kcal mol\u22121) (Table 2). The significant larger mGdnCl value of 3CLI+II (4.94 kcal mol\u22121 M\u22121) than full-length 3CLpro (1.15 kcal mol\u22121 M\u22121) clearly indicates the pronounced increase of surface area exposure on denaturation of 3CLI+II (26). This actually defines the functional role of domain III in SARS-CoV main protease.",

It includes a folded monomer, an intermediate with folded domain III but unfolded domain (I+II), and a completely unfolded form. The enzyme starts to dissociate at very early stage, at GdnCl concentration of <0.1 M. The dissociated monomer then starts to unfold at <0.4 M and reaches the first plateau at 2\u20133 M. The second unfolding then starts, which reaches another plateau at 4.5 M GdnCl. The complete dissociation and differential unfolding of the structural domains are summarized in Fig. 8. This schematic presentation only lists the major enzyme species of the complex folding process. The sharp unfolding curves for 3CLI+II (Fig. 6) and the completely reversible of the unfolding process (Fig. 2 B) consistent with that 3CLI+II without domain III can fold independently into an intact chymotrypsin-like fold. Domain III thus must have extra functional role.  ",
