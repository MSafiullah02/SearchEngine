Patients with prolonged weaning are defined as those who have failed at least three weaning attempts or require more than 7 days of weaning [1]. Prolonged weaning is associated with higher rates of complications and mortality [2\u20134]. Many other factors can prolong weaning, including respiratory muscle weakness, abnormal respiratory mechanics, impaired gas exchange, cardiac dysfunction, and psychological distress. It is therefore important to identify the factors underlying a weaning difficulty [5, 6].",

He remained conscious but had a poor spontaneous cough with sputum production and weak limb muscle strength (grade 2\u20133). His cough reflex was absent during bronchoscopic sputum suction, and he used abdominal breathing during the T-tube test. Two hours after the T-tube test, an arterial blood gas analysis revealed hypercapnia with a pH of 7.25, pCO2 of 94.2 mmHg, pO2 of 81 mmHg, and base excess of 10.3 mmol/L. These signs could not be easily attributed to the common causes of weaning difficulties (e.g., diaphragmatic dysfunction, ICU-acquired myasthenia). We therefore suspected a dysfunction in the respiratory center of the brain stem (e.g., brain stem infarct) and performed a CT examination of the brain. However, no anomalies were found.",

In contrast to most previously reported cases with type 2 respiratory failure, our patient initially presented with type I respiratory failure (pCO2, 24.6 mmHg) related to viral pneumonia, rather than Arnold\u2013Chiari malformation. Our case was characterized by a weaning difficulty attributed to this Arnold\u2013Chiari malformation and a posterior dislocation of the odontoid process. It is important to distinguish this type of weaning difficulty from phrenic nerve dysfunction or ICU-acquired myasthenia, as poor limb muscle strength or abdominal breathing are typical features of both conditions. In the present case, the main clinical manifestation supporting a diagnosis of compression of the respiratory center was the absence of a cough reflex during fiberoptic bronchoscopy suction. Moreover, this patient did not present with typical signs of medullary and high cervical cord compression before developing severe pneumonia. We note that this patient\u2019s symptoms of neck pain, upper limb numbness, and reduced pain sensation below the wrist could also have been caused by cervical spondylosis.

            "text": "In our present case, the explanation for prolonged weaning was complicated. Tonsillar herniation with posterior dislocation of the odontoid process might contributed to medullary compression, although this factor was mild. Medullary compression might have been aggravated by a long period of severe hypoxia, secondary brain edema, and elevated intracranial pressure, as well as by emergency endotracheal intubation while in the supine position. During intubation, the decreases in heart rate and blood pressure might have been caused by hypoxemia or compression of the medulla oblongata. The gradual removal of these possible factors led to relief of the medulla oblongata compression, recovery of the patient\u2019s cough reflex, and successful weaning from the ventilator. However, the significant changes in neurological symptoms and signs during follow-up relative to those observed before pneumonia suggested a cervical nerve injury. Kijsirichareanchai et al. have reported a 49-year-old man developed acute hypercapneic respiratory failure during an episode of community-acquired pneumonia [12]. Similar with our case, the man was diagnosed with Chiari malformation type I after the hospitalization without typical neurological symptoms and signs. Suffering from the possible additional medullary and/or cervical cord injury related to the intubation, the patient required tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation (more than 1 year).",
