In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity. Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy. Wellcome Trust Genome",

It is worth noting that TMPRSS2, the primary protease important for viral entry, is highly expressed with a broader distribution ( Fig. 1a ; second column), suggesting that ACE2, rather than TMPRSS2, may be a limiting factor for viral entry at the initial stage of infection. When taking into account the expression of both genes, the cells found in mucosal epithelia in the respiratory tree, ileum, and colon are ACE2 + ( Fig. 1a ; third column), consistent with viral transmission by respiratory droplets, and the potential of fecal-oral transmission 35 . We also assessed ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in developmental datasets from fetal liver, fetal thymus, fetal skin, fetal bone marrow and fetal yolk sac 36, 37 and found little to no expression of ACE2 with no co-expression with TMPRSS2 (data not shown) even if single ACE2 expression is noticeable in certain cell types in placenta/decidua (Fig. 1a ). While we cannot rule out the possibility that the virus uses alternative proteases for entry in such contexts, or that lung fetal tissue expresses the relevant genes, these results are at least consistent with early reports that fail to detect evidence of intrauterine infection through vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy 38 .",

In fact, it was previously shown that SARS-CoV-2 could enter TMPRSS2cells using cathepsin B/L 18 . Indeed, we found that they are much more promiscuously expressed than TMPRSS2, especially cathepsin B, which is expressed in more than 70%-90% of ACE2 + cells (Extended Data Fig. 2 ). However, whether cathepsin B/L can functionally replace TMPRSS2 has not been empirically determined. In the case of SARS-CoV, TMPRSS2 activity is documented to be important for viral transmission 42, 43 . 49 , with the skewed expression towards lower airway/lung parenchyma (Fig.   2a ).

While the correlation coefficients are relatively low (< 0.11), likely due to low expression of ACE2, the expression pattern of the top 50 ACE2-correlated genes (all with adjusted pvalue close to 0; ranked by correlation coefficients) across the respiratory tree is similar to that of ACE2, with a skewed expression toward upper airway (Fig. 2b) Table 1 ). These genes have the highest expression in nasal goblet 2 cells (Fig. 2b) , consistent with the phenotype previously described 25 . Nonetheless, nasal goblet 1 and nasal ciliated 2 cells also significantly express these genes, but less so elsewhere (Fig. 2b) . Given their environmental exposure and the high expression of receptor/receptor-associated enzymes (Fig. 2a) , it is plausible that the nasal epithelial cells were conditioned and primed to express these immune-associated genes to prevent viral susceptibility. This association with innate immune pathways not only highlights the importance of host-microbe dynamics in nasal epithelia, but it may also have implications for subsequent viral pathogenesis and immune-associated protection/pathology.",

            "text": "Respiratory expression of viral receptor/entry-associated genes and implications for viral transmissivityWe next asked whether the enriched expression of viral receptors and entry-associatedmolecules in the nasal region/upper airway could be relevant to viral transmissivity. Here, we assessed the expression of viral receptor genes that are used by other coronaviruses and influenza viruses, including ANPEP (used by HCoV-229 44 ) and DPP4 (used by MERS-CoV 45 ), as well as the enzymes ST6GAL1 and ST3GAL4 in the lung epithelial cell datasets. The latter genes are enzymes which are important for the synthesis of viral receptors used by influenza viruses: \u03b1(2,6)-linked sialic acid and \u03b1(2,3)-linked sialic acid 46 . Notably, the distribution of receptor/receptor-associated enzymes appears to coincide with viral transmissivity patterns based on a comparison to the basic reproduction number (R0), which estimates the number of people who can get infected from a single infected person; and the infection will be able to start spreading in a population when R0 > 1. The skewed distribution of the receptors/enzymes towards the upper airway is observed in viruses with relatively higher R0/infectivity, including those of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 (R0 ~ 1.4-5.0 8,21,22 ), influenza (mean R0 ~1.3 47 ) and HCoV-229E (unidentified R0; associated with common cold 48 ). This distribution is in distinct contrast with that of DPP4, the receptor for MERS-CoV (R0 ~0.3-0.8), a coronavirus with limited human-to-human transmission",

This finding implicates these cells as loci of original infection and possible reservoirs for dissemination within a given patient and from person to person. Importantly, viral infection itself could drastically change the gene expression landscape in the nose and other tissues later on. The up-regulation of innate immune genes, in association with ACE2, in highly-exposed nasal epithelial cells could be the result of their responsiveness to persistent environmental challenges, including viral infection. It would be of great interest to further investigate how other genetic, demographic, and environmental factors might affect this poised state in these cells and whether such state could influence the susceptibility to infection due to its association with viral receptor expression. Future meta-analysis of HCA data can help further assess some of these aspects. All in all, our findings may have significant implications for understanding viral transmissivity, considering that the primary viral transmission is through respiratory droplets. Moreover, as SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, its release does not require cell lysis. Thus, the virus might exploit existing secretory pathways in nasal goblet cells for low-level, continuous-release at the early stage with no overt pathology. These discoveries could have clinical implications with respect to targeting nasal epithelial cells, especially nasal goblet cells, beyond the current usage of face masks, providing a candidate clinical option for transmission prevention and/or early-stage intervention. Finally, it is worth highlighting that this is the first collaborative effort by a Human Cell Atlas Biological Network (the Lung), and illustrates the opportunities from integrative analyses of Human Cell Atlas data, with future examples of consortium work expected soon.",
