LT recipients usually attend regular outpatient clinic assessments to monitor lung function and the immunosuppressant regimen. Since the confinement decree, follow-up has been provided by telemedicine from one day to another. The lessons taught by this monitoring method will help to settle the long-standing debate about whether frequent outpatient clinic visits are necessary. Home spirometry is, of course, a crucial component of remote patient monitoring. Fear of contracting the virus has produced several unwanted behaviours among LT patients, such as failure to monitor the immunosuppressant levels or failure to attend hospital appointments that are sometimes needed to manage complications. We will need to monitor these indirect effects of the pandemic on our highly vulnerable patients. Moreover, inappropriate behaviours have also been noted among physicians. Rumours fuelled by the media that many drugs had beneficial effects on the disease resulted in massive numbers of prescriptions that have depleted the stocks of some drugs. Macrolides are an example. Azithomycin is taken by over half of all LT recipients to treat chronic allograft dysfunction (CLAD) according to guidelines (3) . As CLAD is the leading cause of mortality in LT recipients, its unavailability is clearly a cause of concern.",

As in most countries, the French organ procurement procedures. Many operating rooms have been transformed into intensive care rooms and only a few operating rooms remain available for emergent surgery. Using these rooms for 8-hour-long, LT procedures would constitute an unethical use of limited time and resources.Moreover, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation pumps are chiefly used for Covid-19 patients. OnMarch 16th, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pneumologie de Langue Fran\u00e7aise working group on LT agreed that in the current situation, only patients on the HE list and those not on this list but deemed in urgent need by the LT team should receive LT, after a particularly rigorous assessment of the risk/benefit ratio.Indeed, concern exists about the safety of caring for LT patients in a crowded ICU, where the intensivists are less available than usual for meeting the challenges of post-operative care in LT recipients. Although, in theory, HE LT should be performed, few such procedures have been carried J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f out, chiefly due to technical obstacles in LT centers. There is also a risk of nosocomial Covid-19, which remains not well known, but has been frequently considered by physician or patients to be sufficient reason for refraining from evaluating LT eligibility and performing LT. Given that the main LT listing criterion is a greater than 50% risk of death within one year, delaying LT may cost lives. Thus, some LT candidates may become indirect victims of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
