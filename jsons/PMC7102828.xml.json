Some studies have suggested that optimistic bias, which is also related to risk comparison, provides a broader scope than perceived risk when investigating factors influencing health behavior (e.g. [1]).",

[40] conducted an experimental survey (n\n = 206) to elaborate the relationship between preventive motivation and risk communication. They found that providing information about the severity of a hazard increased the motivation to seek information about that hazard, and also increased individual willingness to take preventive actions. In the context of prostate cancer, Finney Rutten et al. [22] examined data from the 2003 Health Information National Trends Survey in the United States to investigate factors associated with PSA screening. Their findings showed that information seeking by respondents significantly predicted their use of PSA screenings. A study of cancer information by Shim et al. [23] also found that information seeking was associated with prostate cancer screening. To further explore whether information seeking predicts screening practices for diseases in Taiwanese males, the following hypothesis is posited:H3Information seeking significantly and positively predicts intention to undergo prostate cancer screening.\n",

Based on the causes of optimistic bias identified by Br\u00e4nstrom, et al. [42], the analytical results of this study revealed that respondents may exhibit optimistic bias for the following reasons: optimistic bias may help respondents reduce anxiety about getting a disease; they may not consider prostate cancer to be particularly serious (or may not believe that treatments are effective), so optimistic bias becomes robust; respondents may attempt to increase their self-esteem via optimistic bias; finally, respondents may feel that they already live healthy lifestyles or are somehow less prone to cancer because they have no history of serious illness.",

However, their relationship is negative (\u03b2= -0.12, p\n = 0.11), which could mean that optimistic bias reduces the intention to undergo prostate cancer screening. Interestingly, and central to future information seeking studies as well as to interventions in this area, information seeking apparently predicts intention to undergo screening, which is consistent with other classic studies in the information seeking literature. These analytical results are further evidence (particularly given the focus on a particular culture and population) supporting the emerging understanding of information seeking behaviors as a key determinant of health decisions by patients, including understanding of risk and engaging in preventive screening (as noted in Feng & Yan [43]).",

Risk communication is an increasingly important field of research informing new methods for communicating actual individual risk as compared to misconceptions that the patient might hold. If, as suggested earlier, other variables affecting optimistic bias are identified, then such tools for communicating risk can be better tailored to mediate optimistic bias. However, moderating overly optimistic perceptions of risk must be balanced with the risk of unintentionally worrying patients and causing other negative psychosocial responses.",
