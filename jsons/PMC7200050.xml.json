It has been suggested that elevation of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in local or systemic accounted for the symptom formation in human with seasonal influenza virus infection [10\u201312]. Uncontrolled cytokine production (termed \u201ccytokine storm\u201d) in fatal cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 or H7N9 avian influenza virus infection has been found to be as the most common findings [13, 14]. The efficacy of corticosteroids treatment for influenza patients with pneumonia remained controversial. For example, in critically ill patients with severe influenza pneumonia, early combination oseltamivir and corticosteroids treatment seemed to confer a therapeutic benefit [15]. Conversely, retrospective studies revealed that corticosteroids treatment contributed to delay viral clearance and increase mortality in patients with H3N2 or 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection [16, 17]. Therefore, corticosteroids were not recommended as routine drugs to treatment of patients with severe influenza pneumonia [18]. Based on these facts, development of novel immunomodulator or therapeutic approach for treatment of influenza pneumonia is an urgent clinical need.",

It\u2019s well-recognized that the interaction between virus-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and cellular specialized pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) leads to IKB\u03b1/NF-\u03baB dissociation and thus released NF-\u03baB translocates into nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 [19]. Recent studies in vitro and in vivo revealed that massive induction of pro-inflammatory mediators in H5N1-infected patients was NF-\u03baB-dependent [20, 21]. Furthermore, involvement of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs in the low or high pathogenic influenza-mediated dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression has been reported [22, 23]. Therefore, these observations indicated that pharmacological inhibition of certain host cellular signaling associated with regulation of cytokine expression may act as a promising therapeutic strategy for the aberrant immune response induced by IAV.",

Moreover, sinensetin was found to possess a number of pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-tumor [30\u201332].

Therefore, we investigated effects of sinensetin on influenza A virus-mediated upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators expression at mRNA and protein levels. At 24 h post-infection (p.i.), influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) infection dramatically increased mRNA levels for pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IP-10, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8 and MCP-1, while sinensetin treatment significantly reduced the expression of these cytokines and chemokines (Fig. 2b). Consistent with these results, influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) -induced elevated secretion of IL-6, IP-10, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8 and MCP-1 in the culture supernatant was reversed by sinensetin treatment (Fig. 2c).

Our study demonstrated that sinensetin treatment significantly decreased IAV-triggered up-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, IP-10, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, MCP-1, COX-2 and PGE2. Excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators was considered as a hallmark of serious viral infectious diseases [44]. Increased IL-6 expression in patient with seasonal or pandemic influenza A H1N1 infection has been shown to be implicated in clinical symptom formation and illness severity [45]. Although TNF-\u03b1 was documented for its role in antiviral immunity, it has pleiotropic properties that include stimulating other inflammatory mediator expression as well as disturbing the epithelial tight junction barrier, thus promoting development of ARDS [46\u201348]. In mice, studies demonstrated that deficiency in TNF-\u03b1 signaling significantly improved highly virulent H5N1 virus-mediated excessive inflammation and high mortality [49]. Higher levels of chemokines, including IP-10, IL-8 and MCP-1, were believed to be associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) progression and even fatal outcome in patients with H5N1 or H7N9 virus infection [14, 50]. Blockade of IP-10 and MCP-1 was proved to significantly lessen the disease severity of influenza virus infection [51, 52]. Expression of COX-2 and PGE2 has been suggested to play a role in enhancing virus-induced inflammation and impairment of host antiviral immunity [39, 53]. Based on the above evidences, the inhibitory effect on these IAV-induced inflammatory mediators exerted by sinensetin might act as a promising strategy for treatment of influenza infectious diseases with excessive inflammation.",

            "text": "Host intracellular signaling activated by viral infection, such as NF-\u03baB and MAPKs pathways, has been reported to be involved in the aberrant pro-inflammatory response associated with poor clinical outcome [23, 54]. It has been shown that the induction of immune response-related genes in the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus infection was almost NF-\u03baB-dependent [20]. It is believed that aberrant p38 MAPK activation is a critical driver for increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine in patients with severe influenza [49]. Moreover, NF-\u03baB and p38 MAPK signaling are involved in initiating expression of lipid mediators COX-2 and PGE2 [55, 56]. Therefore, targeting of these signalings may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for attenuating dysregulated inflammation in patients with severe influenza. Pharmacologic inhibition of NF-\u03baB, ERK1/2 MAPK and p38 MAPK decreased an array of proinflammatory mediators, including IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, COX-2 and PGE2, and thus improved the outcome of influenza diseases [23, 57\u201360]. Our results showed that the polymethoxylated flavone sinensetin decreased IAV-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB, ERK1/2 MAPK and p38 MAPK signalings. Therefore, it can be speculated that sinensetin exerted anti-inflammatory effect on IAV-mediated inflammation that may be due to its inhibitory action on these intracellular signaling cascades.",
