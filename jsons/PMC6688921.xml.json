The first variable was whether an area had a sizable outbreak of limited duration of a novel viral respiratory disease before the 2015 MERS outbreak. The 2003 SARS outbreak was chosen because it was sizable including local transmission and its duration was limited [8]. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, more than 8000 individuals were infected worldwide with a 9.6% average case fatality rate [9]. In addition, SARS and MERS are both viral respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses, although the case fatality rates reported for SARS were lower than for MERS [10]. Community transmission of SARS was more commonly reported, while MERS transmission in the ROK occurred primarily in healthcare settings or through close contact, e.g. caring for or living with an infected person [10,11]. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic was also caused by viral respiratory infection; however, country-specific H1N1 attack rates were orders of magnitude higher and its case fatality rate was much lower compared to the limited-duration outbreaks of SARS and MERS [10,12,13].",

China, Taiwan\u2013China, Singapore, Canada, and Hong Kong SAR\u2013China each had \u2265100 SARS cases during the 2003 outbreak, and all of those areas were included in the current analyses.

For example, a Korean traveler who was experiencing symptoms consistent with MERS pushed ahead with his plan to travel to Guangdong, China with a layover in Hong Kong SAR [17]. When this traveler was diagnosed with MERS after arrival in China, a public health response was required in China [2]. Although there was no further MERS transmission in China or Hong Kong SAR, public awareness of this imported case may have exacerbated fear among individuals in Hong Kong SAR and Guangdong as well as their local governments. In Taiwan, a patient with suspected MERS was reported on May 30, 2015, although this patient was later confirmed to have influenza B virus infection [30]. This suspected case was one of 17 suspected MERS cases reported in Taiwan between September 2012 and May 2015 [30]. The 17th suspected case was in a person who was neither a ROK citizen nor had visited the ROK [30]. However, the patient could have increased public awareness of MERS in Taiwan. Although countries issued varied levels of travel notices, no countries enforced travel bans or strict quarantine requirements for travelers from the ROK as some did for travelers from countries with Ebola during the West African epidemic [31].",

These guidelines include response plans at airports, hospitals, and local health departments to expedite the identification of individuals suspected of MERS-CoV infection after arriving from MERS-affected areas [32]. Following the guidelines, virological testing for MERS-CoV and other respiratory viruses has been implemented to confirm whether individuals with recent travel to MERS-affected areas and symptoms consistent with MERS are infected with MERS-CoV or not [32,33]. Also, the ROK's amended quarantine act specifies MERS as a quarantinable infectious disease [34]. These efforts may decrease the risk of future MERS outbreaks in the ROK.",

As we discussed, issuance of travel notices may correlate with past outbreak experience in that governments in countries or localities that previously experienced outbreaks may be more likely to issue stronger notices. In addition, stronger travel notices in some countries may have correlated with greater decreases in travel volumes during the MERS outbreak in the ROK. However, we were unable to create categorical variables for issuance of travel notices because each country has its own process and terminology for travel notices. Although many countries have similar structures for level of travel notices, they are not easily comparable. In addition to level, each travel notice contains outbreak-specific recommendations. Recommendations, such as avoiding unnecessary hospital visits while in the ROK, further complicate comparisons of the intensity of travel health notices among countries. Thus, we were unable to quantify differences between stronger and weaker travel notices across countries. Also, there could be other country- or area-specific factors, which could affect travel volumes during a disease outbreak, but were not considered in the current analyses.",

While SARS was also caused by a novel coronavirus resulting in respiratory disease similar to MERS, exposure to other sizable outbreaks, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic or the 2013\u20132015 Ebola epidemic, may also have affected governments' and individuals' perceptions of risk from the 2015 MERS outbreak. Although there was a large difference between the top five areas with at least 238 probable SARS cases for each and the next highest country with 63 probable SARS cases during the 2013 outbreak (Appendix Figure 3), a single threshold of \u2265100 SARS cases were used. Also, a threshold of \u2265100 SARS cases was used without considering other potentially critical factors, such as population size, the extent of geographic area, the time duration of the SARS outbreak, or extent of unlinked community transmission. For instance, both Canada and Singapore had \u2265100 SARS cases in 2003. However, more than 95% of probable SARS cases in Canada (n = 247) were observed in the greater Toronto area [35], a small part of Canada, while the SARS outbreak in Singapore (n = 238) was over the entire country [9]. Thus, Canadian governments' and individuals\u2019 perceptions of risk from the 2015 MERS outbreak associated with their SARS outbreak experience could be different from the perception of risk from the 2015 MERS outbreak in Singapore.",

The solid line with circles shows the average monthly percentage changes in numbers of arrivals from areas in the close category, while the dotted line with x is the average percentage changes in numbers of arrivals from areas in the intermediate category. The dotted line with triangles shows the average percentage changes in numbers of visitor arrivals from areas in the far category. The shaded area indicates the period between the confirmation of the first Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) case in the ROK (May 20, 2015) and the declaration of the end of the outbreak by the government of the ROK and the World Health Organization (December 23, 2015). The shaded dark gray area indicates the peak period of the MERS outbreak, and the shaded light gray area indicates the non-peak period. Note that increases in arrivals (i.e. positive values) before the outbreak reflect the general trend of increasing numbers of arrivals to the ROK.",
