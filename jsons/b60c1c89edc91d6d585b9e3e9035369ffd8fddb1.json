Different people have different chance to be infected by a disease (due to age or general health conditions), or, in case of opinions, ones are easier to be convinced by others, or stronger at sharing their opinions. The goal of this work is to examine the effect of multiple types of nodes on various random graphs such as Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graphs, preferential attachment random graphs and geometric random graphs. We used two models for the dynamics: SEIR model with vaccination and a version of voter model for exchanging opinions. In the first case, among others, various vaccination strategies are compared to each other, while in the second case we studied sevaral initial configurations to find the key positions where the most effective nodes should be placed to disseminate opinions.",

            "text": "One of our main interests is epidemic spread. The accurate modelling, regulating or preventing of a possible epidemic is still a difficult problem of the 21st century. (As of the time of writing, a novel strain of coronavirus has spread to at least 16 other countries from China, although authorities have been taking serious actions to prevent a worldwide outbreak.) As for mathematical modelling, there are several approaches to model these processes, for example, using differential equations, the theory of random graphs or other probabilistic tools [10, 12, 15] . As it is widely studied, the structure of the underlying graph can have an important impact on the course of the epidemic. In particular, structural properties such as degree distribution and clustering are essential to understand the dynamics and to find the optimal vaccination strategies [7, 11] . From the point of view of random graphs, in case of preferential attachment graphs, it is also known the initial set of infected vertices can have a huge impact on the outcome of the process [3] : A small proportion infected vertices is enough for a large outbreak if the positions are chosen appropriately. On the other hand, varying susceptibility of vertices also has an impact for example on the minimal proportion of vaccinated people to prevent the outbreak [6, 4] . In the current work, by computer simulations, we study various cases when these effects are combined in a SEIR model with vaccination: We have a multitype random graph, and the vaccination strategies may depend on the structure of the graph and types of the vertices as well.",

The voter model is also a common model of interacting particle systems and population dynamics, see e.g. the book of Liggett [16] . This model is related to epidemics as well: Durett and Neuhauser [9] applied the voter model to study virus spread. The two processes can be connected by the following idea: We can see virus spread as a special case of the voter model with two different opinions (healthy and infected), but only one of the opinions (infected) can be transmitted, while any individuals with infected opinion switch to healthy opinion after a period of time. Also the virus can spread only through direct contacts of individuals (edges of the graphs), while in the voter model it is possible for the particles to influence one another without being neighbors in the graph. Similarly to the case of epidemics, the structure of the underlying graph has an important impact on the dynamics of the process [2, 8] . Here we study a version of this model with various underlying random graphs and multiple types of nodes.",

First, nodes try to share their opinions and influence each other, which is successful with probabilities depending on the distance of the two vertices. More precisely, vertices that are closer to each other have higher chance that their opinion \"reaches\" the other one. Still, every vertex can \"hear\" different opinions from many other vertices. In the second phase, if a node v receives the message of m 0 nodes with opinion 0, and m 1 nodes with opinion 1, then v will represent opinion 0 with probability m 0 m 0 +m 1 during the next step, and 0 otherwise. If a node v does not receive any opinions from others at a time step, then its opinion remains the same. This way, the order of influencing message in the first phase can be arbitrary, and it is also possible that two nodes exchange opinions. Now we specify the probability that a vertex x manages to share its opinion to vertex y in the first phase. We transform graph distances d(x, y) into a matrix of transmission probabilities with choice q(x, y) = e \u2212c\u00b7d(x,y) , where c is a constant. This is not a direct analogue of the continuous case, but it is still a natural choice of a decreasing function of d.

However, with c = 2 a node x convinces vertices y with d(x, y) = 3 only with a probability of e \u22126 = 0, 0025. Thus we used the following simplified model: When we created a graph, we stored the list of edges and also calculated for each node the neighbours of distance 2. The simplified voter model spread opinions only on these reduced number of edges with the proper probabilities. We were able to run the original discretized model only on graphs with n = 100, while the simplified version can deal with n = 1000 nodes. We made the assumption that neglecting those tiny probabilities cannot significantly change the outcome of the process. From now on we only model the simplified version of the process.",

Actually, for L old after only one iteration of the voter model it is impossible to see any structure in the distribution of individuals with opinion 1. Vector of opinions became totally random, but with a probability of 0.12. Indeed only with one step of the voter model individuals with opinion 1 could double in number, however opinion 1 cannot take advantage of any special positions in the graph anymore. All in all, giving a certain opinion to individuals who are more likely to be connected in the graph, reduces the probability of disappearing, since they can keep their opinion with a high probability, while with opinion 1 scattered across the graph (in case of L new as well as L rand ) with a dynamic parameter setting of c number of individuals with opinion 1 can reduce drastically even in a few time steps.",

For these reasons, we created ER and BA graphs with multiple nodes, where the proportion of good reasoners is 1 2 and according to preferential attachment (in BA graphs), we set these nodes to be the influencers (they are stable, while non-influencer individuals can be stable and unstable with probability 1 2 ). So in expected value half of the nodes are influencers, but in case of BA graphs we can experience greater deviance (in expected value half of the nodes have good reasoner type according to the ability to convince, and 3 4 of the nodes have stable type). For ER graphs the only meaningful possibility to create types is the random choice, but the same proportions also hold. proportions in BA graphs are still a bit greater). However, in terms of disappearing opinions results are rather different. On ER graphs in none of the cases could opinion 0 disappear, while on BA graphs it strongly depended on the exact initial proportion of influencers in the graph: On the same graph (and hence with the same proportion of influencers) opinion 0 disappears either within the first 50 iterations of the voter model, or holds a high proportion of opinion 1, yet it will never be able to reach the limit. This main difference resulted from the fact that we can not exactly set the proportion of types in BA graphs, thus the co-existence of opinions is rather sensitive to changes in the number of influencers in BA graphs.

Since the graph model is not dynamic, nodes can only choose their type randomly (or according to some deterministic strategy related to the position of nodes in the plane). However firstly we study the model without multiple types, with constant c = 0.5, 0.1. Since the voter model is rather time-consuming, and even in case of parameter c = 0.5 the probability of conviction q(x, y) = e \u2212c\u00b7d(x,y) for d(x, y) = 10 is \u2248 0.0067. Thus we create a reduced graph from RP (n) by erasing edges in case of d(x, y) > 10. We can assume that results on the reduced graph can approximate the outcome on the original one, since transmission of opinions on those edges are negligible. The average degree in the reduced graph is still 27.85. Modifying the voter model to spread opinions only on these edges makes the algorithm less robust and manageable to run the process on graphs with many (n = 1000) nodes.",

The severity of the epidemic for graph structures, both from the aspect of overall attack rate, and number of infected individuals at the peak of the epidemic, for every examined R 0 value is the following in decreasing order: Preferential Attachment, Preferential Attachment mixed with ER, Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs and random graphs generated by the configuration model. Attack rate for the Preferential attachment model is less sensitive to the change in R 0 : Even for the case R 0 = 1.0 the overall attack rate is almost 0.3, while the curve of infected individuals still has high kurtosis, with a maximum of 500 individuals at the climax. From this aspect the models are very different: With bigger R 0 values, especially with R 0 = 1.7 overall attack rates are relatively close to each other, while the number of individuals in I in Preferential attachment graphs is at least 2 \u2212 3 times bigger than in the other three models.The virus spread resulted in an escalated epidemic on every studied random graphs for every possible R 0 values, except for R 0 = [1.0, 1.1] on Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs and on random graphs from configuration model: For these parameters the number of infected individuals just gradually changed in time.

The difference between the effectiveness of the strategies are more outstanding in case of graph structures with (partial) preferential attachment properties, especially for smaller R 0 values. With a less severe virus, nodes with higher degrees vaccinated in the first steps of the process are more likely to survive the necessary 14 days for immunity without becoming infected, thus infection cannot spread at the numerous edges of these nodes. However, with bigger R 0 epidemic seems inevitable. On (partial) preferential attachment models attack rates with uniform vaccination or by contact strategies can be 1.5 \u2212 2 times bigger than with vaccination by degrees.Even for the configuration model we can see the difference in the outcomes, however vaccination by contact strategy gives close values to vaccination by degrees, since many nodes with high degrees coincide with nodes being in denser age groups. Unfortunately, in case of a real underlying network determining the exact number of edges of a node is rather challenging. They can be changing in time, especially with actions taken against the spread of the disease: closing schools, quarantine, shutting down public transportation. Even after calculating possible degrees of nodes, execution of vaccination could be problematic.",

For the configuration model results of vaccination by contacts and degrees behaved the same again.

(In a small component of the graph within a few time steps any opinion can disappear easily, remaining the same for the rest of the process since no other nodes can influence them.) This could be one of the reasons why disappearing probabilities in ER graphs are significantly less. The another reason is in connection with the next part: Since some nodes in BA graphs can possess outstanding number of degrees, while most of them have only a few, the process can be influenced by the properties of nodes chosen to represent opinion 1 initially. On the other hand, on BA graphs not only the probability of the vanishing of opinion 1 is higher, but it is also more likely to get extreme results. Proportions of opinion in ER graphs are more stable. We can generally say that the increase of the density of graphs escalates voter model, since in expected value more convictions happen at every time step, resulting in a more volatile proportion of opinions, and thus in higher probabilities of the disappearance of the underrepresented opinion.",

In fact, proportion of nodes with opinion 1 is stable after viter = 20 steps of the voter model, with a mean of 0.82; 0.98; 0.65; and 0.66 corresponding to the different positions of influencers and graphs. For the two cases of randomly chosen initial opinions L 0 , variance of the proportions is significantly greater than in the deterministic cases. However, this difference in variances seems to derive only from the initial choices of influencers: After 20 iterations not only the mean of the trajectories is stable, but each trajectory itself. The magnitude of proportion of opinion 1 after 20 time steps depends on the degrees of randomly chosen influencers. What is more surprising is that even on BA graphs with choosing the \"oldest\" nodes to be influencers the coexistence property of trajectories still holds. Even after 200 steps of the voter model, opinion 0 did not disappear in any of the cases (from 100 runs), despite low (\u2248 0.02) proportion.Secondly, we examined the influencer model with the nodes of BA graphs getting types according to preferential attachment dynamics.
