            "text": "Vanadium is a versatile and omnipresent element that can attain the oxidation states -III to +V. Low-valent vanadium is stabilized by strongly \u03c0-accepting ligands, carbon monoxide in particular, high valent vanadium by \u03c3 and \u03c0 donors represented by hard, oxygen and nitrogen functional ligands. Soft ligands such as thio-functional ones are predominantly found in vanadium compounds with vanadium in intermediate oxidation states. Vanadium nitrogenase is an example for a naturally occurring vanadium compound where vanadium switches in-between the oxidation states +II and +IV: In vanadium nitrogenase from nitrogen fixing bacteria such as Azotobacter, vanadium -an integral constituent of the fe 7 VS 9 M-cluster -is coordinated to three sulfides, a histidine-n, and two oxygen functions of homocitrate. Vanadium(III) coordinated to water molecules is present in the vanadocytes of sea squirts. The +IV and +V oxidation states, which are the by far predominating ones in physiologically relevant vanadium systems, typically contain the V IV O 2+ , V V O 3+ or V V O 2 + 'core', although there are exceptions. An example for a 'bare' vanadium(IV) complex is the naturally occurring amavadin, where V 4+ is coordinated to two tetradentate n-oxyimino-2,2\u2032-dipropionate ligands. Amavadin is found in mushrooms belonging to the genus Amanita, such as the fly agaric. The oxidovanadium(V) core is present in vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases from, inter alia, marine algae, with vanadate H 2 VO 4 \u2212 coordinatively linked to an active center histidine-n. To date, vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases and vanadium nitrogenases have remained the only identified naturally occurring vanadium-based enzymes. Whether or not vanadium is an essential element for evolutionary younger organisms, including vertebrates, remains to be verified. A functional role of simple vanadium compounds (vanadate in particular) in vertebrates, and hence also in humans, is likely, an assumption which is based on the similarity between vanadate and phosphate. In this context, the vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases are of particular interest since they mimic, or model, enzymes involved in phosphate metabolism, where the protein binding domain for phosphate is blocked by vanadate.",

These auspicious developments have also initiated research towards the design of biologically active vanadium complexes in the search of pharmacological control of cancer, cardiovascular imbalances, and diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, amoebae, and flagellate protozoan parasites. In several cases, ligands have been employed that relate to original pharmacologically applied drugs, with the aim to increase the efficacy of the drug, and to widen the spectrum of therapeutic use by exploiting the cooperative effect of the metal and the ligand. The research into these medicinal applications includes functional alternatives to the phosphate-vanadate antagonism, e.g., the direct interaction of the vanadium compound with the DnA of a tumor cell or the pathogen.",

The abundance of vanadium in the earth's crust thus exceeds its occurrence in the universe (\u22481 ppm) and in the Sun (\u2248 0.4 ppm) by about two orders of magnitude [1] . Volcanic areas with basaltic layers are particularly rich in vanadium, as are hard coal (up to 0.34%) and some oil shales and crude oil. Venezuelan crude oil can contain up to 0.12% V, mostly in the form of oxidovanadium(IV) porphyrins (figure 1a). VO 2+ ions are strongly complexed by porphyrins and related chelators, and the enrichment of crude oil with vanadium is due to its extraction from vanadium-bearing rock by porphyrins present in oil that had passed through rocky layers. natural release of vanadium mainly goes back to weathering of vanadium-containing rock and the erosion of soil.",

In volcanic areas with basalt layers, the concentration of vanadium in underground water, and consequently also in drinking water, can rise to 2.5 \u03bcM [2] .

The main transporter for both anionic vanadate(V), cationic VO 2+ , and neutral or charged {LV IV O} is transferrin [10] . Transferrin (Tf) forms binary complexes {VO 2+ -Tf} and ternary complexes {VOL-Tf} and {VOL\u2032-Tf}, where L is a ligand originally coordinated to VO 2+ , and L\u2032 a low molecular mass (lmm) ligand provided by blood serum, such as lactate [11] , the serum lmm compound with the highest concentration, i.e., 1.5 mM. The VO 2+ ion binds into the same protein pocket as fe 3+ , and hence to two tyrosinates, an aspartate, and the n\u03b5 of a histidine, plus a synergistic carbonate (figure 3a). With increasing blood serum concentrations of vanadium, high-molecular mass transporters other than Tf come in, namely serum albumin (Ab) and immunoglobulin g (Ig) [12] . These proteins preferentially form ternary complexes, {VOL-Ab} and {VOL-Ig}. As shown in figure 3b , the protein binds to the VOL moiety via a histidine residue. Plasma vanadium contents decline in three phases: The first phase is a rapid decline with a half-life t 1/2 of 1 hour, followed by a second intermediate decline (t 1/2 \u2248 26 hours) and a third slow decline with t 1/2 \u2248 10 days. Vanadium contents in blood are thus reduced to about 30% within the first 24 hours [9] . Clearing occurs directly via urinary excretion, and after distribution over tissues of the inner compartment (heart, liver, kidney, spleen), the outer compartment (brain, muscle, adipose tissue), and bones. About 50% of the vanadium is recovered in urine after 12 days. The residence time of vanadium in bones, where it replaces phosphorus in hydroxyapatite, Ca 5 (PO 4 ) 3 OH, is ca. 1 month [13] , corresponding to a half-life of 4-5 days.",

Vanadate and oxidovanadium(IV) bound to transferrin can enter the intracellular space by endocytosis -analogously to fe 3+ , the main target ion for transferrin. An additional conceivable path -for a stable vanadium coordination compound with a sufficiently lipophilic coordination sphere -is diffusion across the cell membrane.

Vanadium compounds are considered potentially genotoxic and thus mutagenic, teratogenic, and 'suspected carcinogenic'. Classification as a carcinogen is based on the fact that vanadium induces the formation of tumor-associated antigens, and that it can directly and indirectly damage DnA and affect DnA repair [1b, 16] .

Biological detoxification of vanadate occurs via integration into the hydroxyapatite structure of the bones (vide supra) and by reduction to vanadium(IV) [20] . glutathione, ascorbate, nADH, and nADPH are examples for agents that can reduce vanadate. In ascidians, reduction equivalents for the reduction of H 2 VO 4 \u2212 to VO 2+ are supposedly delivered by nADPH (generated in the pentose phosphate pathway) via the redox couple 2gSH \u21cc gSSg + 2H + + 2e -, where gSH and gSSg are the reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione, respectively [21] . Vanadium(III) plays, if any, a minor role only, since vanadium(IV) is not easily reduced to vanadium(III) at physiological conditions -and if so, rapidly re-oxidized to vanadium(IV). Vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V) are easily interconverted by physiologically relevant redox agents such as nAD + /nADH, nADP + /nADPH, fAD 2+ /fADH 2 , glutathione, and ascorbate. further, V IV and V V redox-interact with reactive oxygen species. The redox potential for the couple H 2 VO 4 \u2212 /VO 2+ (eqn. 5) at pH 7 is \u22120.34 V, which compares to \u22120.32 V for the couple nAD + /nADH. ",

In the slightly acidic to alkaline regime (ca. pH [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] ] (6-n)-(n = 3-0) comes in. for the structural formulae of these oligovanadates see figure 5 . Commonly, physiological vanadate concentrations at subtoxic levels are too low to allow for the formation of oligovanadates. Locally, however, concentration enhancement or template-directed nucleation [25] may occur, and the oligovanadate(s) then formed can interact with proteins and DnA. An example is the incorporation of tetravanadate into Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase [26a] , and the promotion of the hydrolytic cleavage of the ester bond in a phosphodiester RnA model by tetravanadate [26b] . Decavanadate is thermodynamically unstable at pH values exceeding 6.3; its decay into vanadates of lower nuclearity (including monovanadate) is, however, kinetically hampered, allowing for half-lives at pH 7, and even somewhat above pH 7, of several hours. Additional stabilization takes place by close interaction with proteins such as tubulins [27] and myosin [28] as well as with mitochondria [29] . Tubulins are proteins that assemble to structural elements (termed microtubules) of cytoskeletons. Myosin is involved in muscle contraction. Myosin binds decavanadate with high affinity, forming a myosin-MgATP-decavanadate complex that blocks the contractile cycle. Decavanadate that targets mitochondrial proteins inhibits mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Stabilization of decavanadate can also be achieved by its incorporation into tiny water pools of intracellular compartments -as suggested by model experiments with reverse micelles with nanoscopically confined water in the micelles' cavities [30] .",

The higher average charge enables phosphate to interact more efficiently than vanadate with dipoles (such as water) and anions (e.g., anionic amino acid residues in protein matrices). On the other hand, phosphorus can attain the coordination number 5 in transitional states only, while the d-block element vanadium easily extends its coordination number by forming stable penta-and hexa-coordinate complexes.

In the lower part of figure 6 , the mechanistic sequence of the phosphoester hydrolysis as catalyzed by phosphatases is illustrated. Apart from vanadate, many complexes of V III , V IV , and V V with organic ligands that are related to or mimic physiologically available ligands, effectively inhibit phosphatases [35] , likely after off-dissociation of all or part of the ligands and thus formation of vanadate or {VO x L} intermediates with an 'open' coordination site capable of interacting with, and thus blocking, the active site of the enzyme. Vanadates can also activate biochemical processes.

Approximately 90% of all diabetic cases are ascribed to type 2 diabetes, the remaining 10% to type 1 diabetes [42a] . Type 1 diabetes (\"juvenile diabetes\") goes along with absent or only residual insulin supply by the \u03b2 cells in the Langerhans islets of the pancreas, commonly caused by degeneration of the \u03b2 cells in the frame of autoimmune reactions, or by accidental dysfunction or loss of the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes (\"adult onset diabetes\") is related, in its initial stage, to insufficient response of the cellular insulin receptors to insulin. In its advanced stage, a feed-back mechanism comes in, provoking \u03b2 cell failure caused by de-differentiation of the \u03b2 cells [43] . Type 2 diabetes typically concerns people beyond the age of 50; its onset can be kept in check by physical exercise and reasonable nutritional behavior. However, diabetes type 2 is nowadays increasingly diagnosed also with young people and even children; this juvenile onset type 2 diabetes appears to be correlated to obesity [42b].",

The C-chain is detached in the final step of insulin synthesis; in genuine insulin, the A-and B-chains are linked through two cystines. Insulin is stored as a C 3 -symmetric hexamer, with the monomers linked through histidines via zinc ions [44] . The discharge of the active, monomeric form of insulin is initiated by elevated blood glucose levels. Insulin targets the cellular insulin receptor, triggering a complex mechanism by which glucose becomes internalized into the cytosol, followed by glucose metabolism. further, insulin is involved in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of glucose from smaller building blocks, for example amino acids), and in glycogenesis (the synthesis of glycogen). Insulin is thus strongly involved in glucose homeostasis. In addition, insulin stimulates lipogenesis and inhibits lipolysis, and thus prevents ketoacidosis caused by the accumulation of ketonic bodies such as acetyl acetic acid in the blood. Ketonic bodies are causative for the severe disease patterns accompanied with progressive states of diabetes, such as retinopathy and dying off of limbs.",

In the absence of insulin (diabetes 1) or insufficient insulin response (diabetes 2), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP) dephosphorylates the IR, and the glucose intake is annulled. Vanadate can block PTP and thus restore the signalling path.

Inorganic vanadate generated under physiological conditions from, for example, [VO(maltol) 2 ] (1a in figure 9 ) has been shown to discriminate between hepatocytes and hepatoma cells in as far as vanadate significantly increases the generation of ROS (superoxide and hydrogen peroxide), and concomitantly causes cell cycle arrest in hepatoma but not in normal liver cells (hepatocytes) [61] . Similarly, the formation of ROS by fe 2+ -after vanadium-induced disintegration of ferritin -may be responsible for the vulnerability of astrocytoma cells, while astrocytes (cells of the brain and spinal chord) remain unaffected [62] .",

The inhibition of PTPase by coordination of vanadate to the active site cysteine, as well as oxidative inhibition (cysteine \u2192 cystine) by vanadium-induced production of peroxide, result in an up-regulation of protein kinase B (Akt). Akt plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy and angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels from preformed ones), and thus in the prevention of, and recovery after, myocardial infarction.

As in the case of antiviral and antibacterial vanadium compounds, none of these compounds has so far achieved the status of clinical tests, and studies have thus been restricted to in vitro tests with cultures of the parasites. In many cases, these studies reveal antiparasitic properties of the vanadium species, which are about comparable to or even more effective than established medications. In this section, selected examples of antiparasitic vanadium complexes are briefly described. for a recent overview see also the review by D. gambino [72] . Respective vanadium compounds are illustrated in figure 14 ; selected results are summarized in Table 4 [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] . Complexes and formulations that have been shown to exert antiparasitic potential against parasites causing amoebiasis (19) , Chagas' disease (20) , and leishmaniasis (20, 21, 22) . for details see text and Table 4 .",

The etiologic agent of the disease is the amoeba Entamoeba histolytica, present in contaminated food and water in particular in areas of low sanitary and hygiene standards. Transmission occurs mainly by the fecal-oral route and through direct contact. 90% of the infected people are asymptomatic. for the remaining 10% the symptoms include diarrhea and, in more serious cases, dysentery (an inflammatory disorder mainly of the colon) with mucus and blood, the latter stemming from amoebae that succeed to overcome the epithelium of the intestines and thus travel to other organs, the liver in particular, where they cause deadly abscesses. The death toll amounts to ca. 70,000 per year. The hydrazone complex 19 in figure 14 is an example for an efficient amoebocidal (pro)drug [73] . With an IC 50 = 0.36 \u03bcM, the compound is more efficient than the standard drug Metronidazole (IC 50 = 1.89 \u03bcM), and somewhat more toxic than Metronidazole against human cervical HeLa cancer cell lines.",

            "text": "Chagas' disease is caused by the flagellate protozoan parasite Trypanosomas cruzi, transmitted by the feces of \"kissing bugs\", blood-sucking bugs belonging to the subfamily Triatominae. About 10 million people are infected, with ca. 10,000 deaths per year. The disease is mainly distributed in Latin America, but also increasingly spreading into north America and europe. Primary symptoms are skin lesions and swelling of the eye lids; secondary symptoms include digestive and neurological alteration, and cardiac disorder up to heart failure. The oxidovanadium complex 20 [74] contains a salicylidene semicarbazone ligand and hence a ligand that has also been shown to convey anticancer (compound 12) and antiamoebiasis activity (19) . The additional ligand in 20 is phenanthroline, capable of intercalating DnA (figure 12b). The metabolic pathways of parasites such as Trypanosoma and Leishmania are similar to those in tumor cells, suggesting a similar mode of action of anti-parasitic and anti-tumor drugs. Complexes such as compound 20, which are about as trypanocidal against epimastigotes (a developmental state of the parasite in the bug) of T. cruzi as the reference drug nifurtimox, are in fact cytotoxic against leukemia cells [74] and cause conformational changes in plasmid DnA [75] . Complex 20 is also active on the promastigote and amastigote forms (the flagellate and non-flagellate stages, respectively) of Leishmania parasites, responsible for the tropical and subtropical disease leishmaniasis. The vectors for this disease, which is associated with malnutrition and weakness of the immune system, are sandflies of the subfamily Phlebotomina. About 12 million people are affected worldwide. The most serious form of this disease is visceral leishmaniasis, which goes along with high fever, weight loss, swelling of the spleen and liver, and anemia. Visceral leishmaniasis is mainly distributed in Brazil, India, Bangladesh, and Sudan, and accounts for 60,000 deaths each year.",

Along with metallic vanadium, vanadium oxides (\"VO x \") are in use as catalysts in oxidation reactions (an example is the production of sulfuric acid from SO 2 ), as an uV-absorbing additive in glass ware, and in the form of lithium and silver vanadates in lithium batteries [80] . The first indication for the presence of vanadium in a living organism, i.e., the sugar beet, goes back to 1888 [81] ; the essentiality of vanadium for some life forms became established in 1982/83 by the discovery of vanadate-dependent bromoperoxidase in the marine macro-alga Ascophyllum nodosum [82] .",

            "text": "The possibly most important aspect in choosing vanadium as the central metal in these coordination compounds is their (partial) rebuilt to vanadate(V) and oxidovanadium(IV) in the physiological broth. Vanadate is an antagonist of phosphate -as demonstrated for the first time by Cantley in 1977 for the inhibition of the na,K-ATPase, the sodium-potassium pump [84] . Based on the interference of vanadate with metabolic processes depending on phosphate in general, and on phosphate-regulated enzymatic activity in particular, vanadate has also been introduced into the amelioration of cardiac dysfunctions, and in fighting malignant tumors. The latter application, first investigated systematically by K\u00f6pf and K\u00f6pf-Maier [60] , is based, at least in part, on the direct interaction of stable vanadium-ligand fragments with the DnA of cancer cells -and is thus reminiscent of the action of the well established anticancer drug cisplatin. Stable fragments in vanadium compounds are represented by the cyclopentadienide ligands in vanadocenes, and by n-functional, oligodentate aromatic ligands such as ortho-phenanthroline and derivatives thereof.",
