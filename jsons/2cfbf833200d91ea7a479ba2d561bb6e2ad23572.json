Many devastating events are widespread and naturally occurring, like hurricanes, in which we have ample warning time to enact preparation plans; while others, like earthquakes, volcanoes, or tsunamis may kill or injure thousands before the news reports hit the airwaves. Industrial accidents and terrorist events are usually sudden and occur without any warning. Any of these events may have a local or regional effect; some may even have a global impact [1] . Regardless of the cause, after such an event, large amounts of the populace will be seeking medical care, whether from their primary care providers, public health departments, or local hospitals.",

This requires an awareness of the vulnerabilities of one's region, as well as on-going global surveillance. Development of a response plan is requisite for any hospital to have a significant expectation to be able to respond in a meaningful way to a sudden disaster that leaves large amounts of the population seeking emergency medical care. Preparedness plans include performing hazard-vulnerability analysis (HVA), coordinating of response plans with all potentially involved entities, reviewing results of routine drilling, and revising the plan based on results of practice. In order to prepare and plan accordingly for different possible scenarios that may overwhelm routine operations, it is essential to identify available resources, specifically people, materials, and physical locations -often referred to as; staff, stuff, and space [2] .",

Failure to do so may leave the institution in a situation with an excessive demand for resources and limited HCWs. The lack of available HCWs may be due to disease, injury, or fear of acquiring disease and exposing families and close contacts. Therefore, it is paramount that the HCW is reassured that their level of personal protective equipment (PPE) is more than adequate and that continuous surveillance, screening, and quality compliance programs have been implemented across the facility for their protection. 2. Staffing plans require careful consideration, as due to direct and indirect situations, their actual number may be lower than during routine operations, as the hospital faces an increased demand.

Adequate ratios of supervision must be maintained with experienced personnel, utilizing clear guidelines and protocols. Previous basic training with courses like Fundamental Critical Care Support course (FCCS) [21] and FDM would facilitate this model. 3. Rationing of critical care should only be considered after all efforts at augmentation have been exceeded. The province of Ontario, Canada, after their experience during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, developed a critical care/ventilator triage protocol based on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) [22] to be used in case of a pandemic, in view of the potential limitation in the number of ventilators. All decisions should follow well-defined, objective protocols using this score or similar approaches. All patients should receive basic care, including comfort and palliative support in extreme situations, even when the standard of care cannot be maintained. 4. Biological threats [24, 25] :",

Secured access may be the most important safety program during an incident, including perimeter definition and its maintenance with attention to strategic areas such as switchboards, medical gas depots, generators, and pharmacy. Enhanced security will help the facility maintain independence, as the facility may become the target of desperate community members if all other institutions in the locale have failed. 11. The plan should consider ideally a surge of up to 3 times the normal ICU census and 10-day self-sustainability [3] . 12. The plan should have a graded response based on the potential size of the demand, from multiple casualty events to catastrophic situations, with clear delineation of interinstitutional coordination and participations. 13. Transfer agreements should be obtained with regional and extraregional facilities (Joint Commission requirement in the USA) [18] in situations where the hospital integrity and/or functionality are compromised. 14. The designation of resources should follow a prioritization scheme based on severity, available expertise at the site, and institutional surge capacity. The person performing TRIAGE should be experienced and follow objective guidelines with classification criteria and facilitate patient flow to predesignated surge areas depending on level of support required and number of casualties. 15. Physical space used for delivery of EMCC should have the infrastructure to support expected critical interventions, such as mechanical ventilation (which requires a supply of medical gases), monitoring, and emergency generator-supported electricity. Areas of expansion may include elective procedure recovery wards in outpatient surgical centers, pre-and postangiography or cardiac catheterization units, and endoscopy suites. Other suitable areas include mobile (i.e., tents or trailers) ICU facilities, and even veterinary hospitals. Many plans purposefully avoid delivering prolonged care in postanesthesia care units (crucial for the utilization of the operating rooms) and the ED, in order to maintain the functionality of these to departments as much as possible. Should more critical care space be required, consideration should be given to expand, sequentially, to intermediate or step-down care units, telemetry units, and eventually hospital wards. Other nonmedical facilities should be avoided, as they require significant repurposing for EMCC. They should be considered only in extreme circumstances on a temporary basis, when there has been a significant impairment of the hospital infrastructure.",
