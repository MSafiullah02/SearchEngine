However, the differences in this risk with NIPPV compared to HFNC are largely unknown. Presently, it is known that COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to SARS-CoV-1 remains viable in aerosols for at least 3 h with a marginal reduction in infectious titer from 103.5 to 102.7 TCID50 per liter of air [4] . Likewise, it showed a higher stability on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard, with virus viability seen up to 72 h on these surfaces [4] . This provides a concerning phenomenon for both HFNC and NIPPV as both interfaces are plastic with potential for aerosolization. An important difference is that the NIPPV interface provides a potential closed system (which may be advantageous) whereas HFNC allows patients to frequently touch their faces with continuous exposure to droplets, potentially increasing transmission to inanimate surfaces and hospital workers.",

Unfortunately, viruses were not included in this study. Likewise, the term \"aerosol\" is a misnomer as it is well described that larger particle droplets can remain longer in circulation if ambient airflows (as in HFNC) sustain the infectious suspension for a longer duration. This, coupled with data from influenza infections showing aerosolized viruses are infectious at a lower dose than by nasal instillation, makes use of HFNC potentially worrisome [6] . The only known study evaluating SARS development in hospital workers was a retrospective study conducted prior to the widespread use of HFNC showing that development of SARS occurred in tracheal intubation (35%), HFNC 8%, and 38% (NIPPV) [3] ; this suggests that both noninvasive (including HFNC) and invasive ventilation approaches carry significant risk.",
