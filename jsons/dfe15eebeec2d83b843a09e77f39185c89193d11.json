One method (Figure 1 ), described by Akowitz and Manuelidis [12] , was referred to as primer-directed enzymatic amplification, and was developed to make cDNA libraries from small amounts of mRNA. DNA linker-adapters were generated by annealing together complementary 12-mer and 19-mer oligonucleotides and then ligating them to the blunt ends of cDNA. The 12mer was phosphorylated at the 5 0 end to increase the efficiency of ligation because by doing this both DNA strands could be covalently joined together by a phosphodiester bond. As the 19mer oligonucleotide was complementary to both ends of the ligated cDNA, it could be used as a pri-mer for PCR amplification. In this way, a representative bacteriophage gt10 cDNA library was created from about 20 pg of globin mRNA. Another method (Figure 2 ), described by Johnson [13] , Figure 1 . A linker-adapter with an overhang and one phosphorylated 5 0 end. The synthetic oligonucleotides used in the work of Akowitz and Manuelidis [12] .

This adapter was then annealed to the blunt-ended cDNA. The cDNA contains the region of interest whose sequence is unknown. The 19-mer oligonucleotide was used as a PCR primer to amplify the cDNA, as it was able to anneal to both ends of the cDNA with the attached adapters-linkers.

These linker-adaptors were ligated onto the MboI digested chromosomal DNA. The 20-mer oligonucleotide was subsequently used as a primer to PCR amplify the chromosomal DNA of unknown sequence involved the digestion of chromosomal DNA by the restriction enzyme MboI. A linker-adapter with an overhanging MboI site was made from a complementary pair of oligonucleotides (a 5'-phosphorylatyed 24-mer and a complementary 20-mer).

Figure 5 gives an overview of the technique. Initially, there needs to be some pre-treatment of the sample to remove any non-viral nucleic acid, which might come from both bacteria and host nuclei or mitochondria. The methods used to separate viral from non-viral nucleic acid are based on the relatively small size of viral particles and the protection of the viral genome by the capsid and, if present, the envelope. For example, for purification of rotavirus dsRNA from faeces, Lambden et al. [14, 15] treated the faecal suspension with ribonuclease T1 prior to extraction with the guanidinium-based reagent RNAzol B and silica particles (Geneclean II). The high concentrations of rotavirus present in faeces (e.g. 10 10 particles) facilitated the extraction, and up to 100 ng dsRNA were recovered. Other viruses in other tissues may not yield as much genomic nucleic acid, and so the removal of extraneous DNA and RNA becomes even more critical. For the extraction of viral nucleic acid from blood, Allander et al. purified serum through 0.22 mm filters (to remove cells and mitochondria) and removed any free DNA by digestion with DNase I [19, 20] . For viruses that are larger than 0.2 mm, for example herpesviruses, a caesium chloride gradient (density of They were ligated to cDNA of unknown sequence. The overlap at one end of the hybrid ensured that the other, blunt end of the adapters ligated with the blunt ends of the cDNA. The adapters contained EcoRI and NotI restriction sites so that amplified DNA could be inserted into cloning vectors efficiently due to the sequence and size of these restriction sites. EcoRI and NotI are enzymes that cut DNA infrequently and are unlikely to occur very often in the cDNA. Hence, they are sites commonly engineered into cloning vectors. The adapters contain half an NruI site at their blunt end. Therefore, if two adapters ligate together to form a dimer an NruI site is formed. Digestion with NruI prior to the ligation will cleave the dimer back into two monomers. This step is necessary because the dimers may preferentially ligate into the cloning vector and so reduce the efficiency of the cDNA cloning (Reyes et al. [8] ) Figure 5 . An overview of SISPA. This method is used to amplify viral nucleic acid of unknown sequence. Initially, the sample is pretreated by a combination of methods to aid purification of the viral nucleic acid. These methods include filtration of the sample to remove host cells and mitochondria, removal of extracellular DNA by DNase treatment and the isolation of viral particles by centrifugation. Finally, the remaining viral nucleic acid can be further purified by silica particle and guanidinium extraction methods. The sample may need to be divided at this stage if it is not known whether the viral nucleic acid is either RNA or DNA. If ssDNA is present, a second strand of DNA needs to be synthesized; if the sample contains RNA, cDNA needs to be generated. Once dsDNA has been produced, it can be digested by restriction enzymes. This enables the ligation of adapter-linkers with the relevant overhangs. Alternatively, adapter-linkers with blunt ends can be ligated onto the termini of undigested dsDNA. To amplify the unknown viral nucleic acid, a primer can be used that is complementary to the known sequence of the adapter-linker. A further selective round of amplification can be performed using a primer with an additional nucleotide at the 3 0 end. By doing this, in theory, only a quarter of the DNA fragments will be amplified. Finally, the sequence of the amplified viral nucleic acid can be characterised by downstream cloning and sequencing. More detail on these methods can be found in the main text virus particles usually exceeds 1.11 g/ml) or a sucrose cushion (usually 30%) could give a higher yield than filtration [21] . Another option prior to extraction is to concentrate viral particles by ultracentrifugation [22] . In some cases, it may be possible to use cell culture to amplify any virus present. If the cells show a cytopathic effect, nucleic acid can be extracted from virus purified from the culture supernatant [23] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 639, "end": 643, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 644, "end": 647, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1291, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1292, "end": 1295, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2319, "end": 2322, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3972, "end": 3976, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 4071, "end": 4075, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 4280, "end": 4284, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 143, "end": 151, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2325, "end": 2333, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Enrichment of the target before SISPA"}, {"text": "The viral nucleic acid is then extracted with either commercial kits (e.g. Qiagen, Crawley, UK) or chaotropic agents, such as TRIzol (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK).

It is necessary to generate dsDNA from the viral nucleic acid because it is the starting molecule for SISPA.

Due to the low complexity of viral genomes, a restriction digest should produce a large amount of a limited number of fragments.

Larger human or bacterial genomes are more complex than viral genomes; therefore many differently sized fragments are generated from a restriction digest. Amplification of these fragments would result in a DNA smear on an agarose gel. Ultimately, the resulting viral PCR amplicons can either be cloned and sequenced [19] , immunoscreened [9, 10] , characterised by hybridisation reactions [8] or be identified via a DNA microarray [26] [27] [28] The main advantages of SISPA are: (i) that it can be used to identify an unknown viral nucleic acid present in relatively limited amounts (10 6 copies) and, (ii) that it is culture independent [8, 19, 29] . The method can be applied to all kinds of clinical sample and can be used to identify both ss and dsRNA and DNA viruses [8, 15, 21] . The abundance of host and mitochondrial DNA in samples is the main disadvantage, and also the presence of other contaminating sequences (e.g. bacterial ones). To monitor for this, the extracted nucleic acid can be screened by PCR for human 18S rDNA and human mitochondrial DNA, and the results of both these PCRs would be expected to be negative [21] .

In comparison, sufficient full-length cDNA for SISPA was generated from 10 ng of each dsRNA group C rotavirus genome segment, extracted from stool samples [14] .

The DNA is digested with two frequently cutting restriction enzymes, for example MseI and HinPII, both of which have four base pair recognition sites. This produces DNA molecules with MseI and HinP1I overhangs at either end, as well as some with MseI-MseI and HinP1I-HinP1I overhangs. Only the MseI and HinP1I fragments are amplified in the subsequent PCR as each adapter binds to one specific end of the DNA fragment, according to its complementary overhang. Two primers specific to each adapter are then used in an exponential amplification reaction by PCR. A second selective nested PCR amplification can be used to simplify the resultant PCR products from a DNA smear to specific bands. By extending the 3 0 end of the primers by one to three nucleotides, a subset of the PCR products is generated [31] . There are 16 different possible primer combinations (4 \u00c2 4) if each primer is extended by only one nucleotide (i.e. Mse1 \u00fe N and HinP1I \u00fe N).

Random PCR. Random PCR can be used to amplify both DNA and RNA viral genomes. Here, a primer with a unique 5 0 end sequence (indicated by the wavy line) and a fully degenerate 3 0 end sequence is used in a PCR reaction to amplify viral DNA. Usually a lower annealing temperature or touchdown conditions are used. The degenerate part of the primer anneals to complementary DNA sequences which occur stochastically throughout the viral genome. The primer is extended using T4 polymerase. Then the generated double stranded sequences are separated by denaturation and complementary sequences hybridise to form finite portions of dsDNA with the first primer present at each end (as shown by the darker lines in the diagram).

In virology, the most likely samples to be compared are pre-and post-infection samples. The DNA isolated from the pre-infection sample acts as the 'driver' and is compared with the DNA isolated from the post-infection sample, the 'tester'. The two DNA samples are hybridised together so as to reduce common sequences, leaving mainly viral sequences for downstream analysis. As Figure 8 shows, the genome complexity is reduced in both samples by a restriction enzyme digest, following which adapters are ligated only to the restriction fragments from the tester DNA. The two digested DNA samples are then combined, heated to melt the double-strands, and then cooled to allow the strands to anneal back together. Complementary sequences from the tester and driver DNA samples will hybridise together, while unique tester DNA sequences can only hybridise to each other. The ends of the DNA fragments are filled in, and then a primer complementary to the adapter sequence is used for PCR amplification. Heterogeneous annealed testerdriver fragments will undergo linear amplification because they have only one adapter sequence (from the tester DNA strand). The unique reannealed tester homogeneous fragments will undergo exponential amplification because they have two adapter sequences (from both tester DNA strands). The homogeneous reannealed driver DNA fragments have no adapter sequences, and so should not be amplified. Remaining singlestranded DNA fragments are digested with mung bean nuclease, which is specific for singlestranded DNA. By using the newly enriched tester amplicon as the starting material for each round, this subtraction/amplification procedure can be repeated several times. Sufficiently enriched in this way, the tester amplicons can then either be cloned for library construction, used as a probe source for library screening, or sequenced directly. Two highly matched nucleic acid sources are necessary for successful recovery of difference products, which severely limits the use of RDA. Also, amplification of sequences from both DNAs needs to occur equally well, but this cannot be guaranteed if the DNAs are amplified in separate tubes.

The driver is used at a higher concentration that the tester, to drive the reaction. The DNA samples are digested with a restriction enzyme (e.g. DpnI). A linker/adapter (to provide the primer sequence in further PCR) is added only to the tester DNA digest. The two DNA populations are mixed, heated and annealed to form three kinds of molecules: tester/tester sequences; hybrids of tester and driver; driver/driver sequences.

The tester/tester molecules with the pathogen sequence should be preferentially and exponentially amplified. Nuclease digestion is used to remove unwanted ssDNA and further PCR is performed.

They were modified in 1937 for viruses by Rivers and, lately, SARS-CoV has been shown to fulfil them, but at the expense of infecting macaque monkeys [71, 72] . Arguably, the Koch-Rivers' postulates need to be adapted for pathogen identification by sequence discovery. Until that happens, however, care will need to be taken in interpreting the presence of viral sequences in a clinical specimen as proof of causation of disease. The most obvious strategy following sequence discovery is to make a specific PCR for the new virus and use it to test many specimens from different individuals with that disease and as a control, individuals without the disease. If there are many positive results, there is a high likelihood that the virus is pathogenic for that disease. It needs to be CONCLUDING REMARKS At present, SISPA and other methods for amplification of viral genomes of unknown sequence are complicated and prone to amplification of sequence artefacts with spurious results. These methods have, however, proved their worth in the recovery of previously unknown viruses (see Table 1 ) and, if more reliable, robust and reproducible versions of them can be developed, they are likely to find widespread application.
