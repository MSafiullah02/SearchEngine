Since the hospitalization of the index patient on December 12, 2019, the virus has gradually spread to the globe [3]. As of March 17, 2020, 179,112 cases have been confirmed worldwide, and 7,426 patients have died [4]. Molecular analysis indicates that SARS-CoV-2 probably originated from bats after passage in intermediate hosts, which highlights the high zoonotic potential of coronaviruses [5]. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, namely bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, yet it is more distant from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Furthermore, homology modeling revealed that SARS-CoV-2 might be able to combine with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is identical to the characteristic of SARS-CoV [6,7].",

However, with the advent of low-dose CT and high-resolution CT, this auxiliary examination has become prevalent, which can be attribute to the powerful analytical diagnosis capabilities [39]. For patients suffering from SARS, the average abnormality rate was 98%, with 81% of it being GGO, 49% consolidation, 87% interlobular septal thickening, 74% crazy paving pattern, and 4% parapneumonic effusion [22,23,40]. For patients with MERS infection, the abnormality rate of CT was 100%, with 86% of abnormality for GGO, 65% for consolidation, 38% for pleural effusion, and 35% for interlobular septal thickening [32,41]. The average abnormality rate of COVID-19 is 89%, with 84% of that for GGO, 65% for consolidation, 48% for interlobular septal thickening, 39% for air bronchogram, 16% for crazy paving pattern, and 12% for pleural effusion; for other lesions, see Table 2 [10,36,37,[42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57]]. The analysis illustrated that although the abnormality rates of the three groups were not significantly different (P = 0.1453), the average rates in SARS and MERS were higher than that in COVID-19, which is most likely because of the current network development informing the outbreak of COVID-19 among people of China. Therefore, the entire population has been informed about the seriousness of the problem through the Internet. Early examinations were adopted, and many patients at early stages of infection manifested only fever or no symptoms, which indicated that lung disease had not yet appeared. Because of the limited number of CT scans in studies related to SARS and MERS, the high detection rate might be under suspicion. Interestingly, several studies reported that lung features of SARS under the high-resolution CT scan were identical to those of bronchiolitis obliterans, the steroid-responsive disease [58,59], which provided imaging basis for corticosteroid treatment of coronavirus pneumonia [60].",

Partly because of the lack of literature on MERS, no significant difference was found (P = 0.3516). However, in SARS and COVID-19, there was a significant difference between CT scan and qPCR findings (P = 0.0302, P = 0.00697) (Table.4\n). Although the specificity of qPCR could reach 100% [65,76,77], a sufficient virus titer of the specimen was required. Notably, except for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (100%), the sputum showed the highest positive rate (74.4% \u223c 88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6% \u223c 73.3 %) [76]. The reasons could be the timing of specimen collection, specimen transport, testing, etc. Lower respiratory tract specimens should be considered to improve the sensitivity of qPCR, particularly if results of the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tests were negative; however, with high clinical suspicion, follow-up serological testing should also be applied [15]. Most importantly, clinicians should implement appropriate infection control practices for patients with clinically suspected infection [15], specifically with negative initial qPCR results, notably who possessed typical abnormality in CT scan or chest radiography. Additionally, a single swab was relatively insufficient. In a previous study on MERS infection, 89%of patients had a positive result after one swab, 96.5% had a positive result after two consecutive swabs, and the positive result reached 97.6% after three consecutive swabs [73]. Thus, the initial negative result could be unpersuasive unless repeated tests were performed.",

Under such circumstances, the CT scan might serve as an important tool for the diagnosis of NCP patients. Xie et al. [56] reported five patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who had initial negative RT-PCR results, but typical CT scan showed findings such as GGO or consolidation. After isolation for presumed COVID-19, all patients were eventually confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection by repeated swab tests [56]. In the study of Ai et al. [75], 75% of patients with negative qPCR results had positive chest CT findings. Through analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative to positive qPCR results was 5.1 \u00b1 1.5 days [75].",

Under such a severe epidemic outbreak, CT scan might provide a vital supplement for consummating the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Because of the imperious demand for batch detection, the combination of repeated laboratory examination and CT scan could be helpful for individuals with high clinical suspicion of coronavirus infection but negative qPCR screening result. Once confirmed to be positive, even if a false positive result is obtained, the most strict sequestration should be practiced for eliminating severe risk of transmission.",
