Journeys from one place to another within any infected local area are not allowed except for the following purposes: to perform any official duty; to make a journey to and from any premises providing essential services, non-essential services or food supply; to purchase, supply or deliver food or daily necessities; to seek PHSM involving the whole country continuously for almost 8 weeks is not without a burden. It has a major social consequences and economic costs. At the moment, the decision to implement MCO was acceptable to many in view of disease casualties, but the question is how long should the MCO be in place? There is a need for Malaysian authority to assess and balance the benefits and potential harms of adjusting these MCO duration, so as not to trigger a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and jeopardize the health of the population.",

The error rates were slightly higher for pre-MCO period, with MAPE (I) and MAPE (R) of 33.2% and 15.4% respectively. This is because the data pattern during that period was relatively less well explained by the SIR model especially for I, and the number of data points was smaller as compared to post-MCO period (24 vs 36). This could also be due to these reasons: a) the Ministry of Health increased the test capacity, b) delay in receiving the test results due to overwhelmed laboratory capacity and c) the number of tests fluctuates on daily basis [14, 15] . However, this high error rate was balanced by high R 2 for both I and R (87.9% and 87.8% respectively).",

This is also the case with the pre-MCO R 0 , which is more than 8. However, these R 0 s for both periods were the ones that best explained the observed data.

However, given the limited number of available data points, all available data points were used for the model optimization. Given the urgency of the present situation, it is not reasonable to wait for more data points to be used as the test set to estimate the test goodness of fit and error measures. In our opinion, cross-validation method is also not reasonable in this situation given the small number of data points. Finally, our model used the available incidence data instead of the data based on date of onset [20] .
