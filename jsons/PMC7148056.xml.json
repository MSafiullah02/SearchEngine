While having access to information is now easier than ever with the proliferation of devices and different means of accessing data, keeping up-to-date with all the developments and various aspects of the topic being followed is a difficult task. In many situations, it is hard for readers to connect the dots of a given story [21]. This is due not only to the widespread presence of the media outlets in the digital space [14], but also to the increasing participation of citizens, who produce and promote an unprecedented number of comments and discussions on social media (some of them lasting over days, weeks or months). Automatic narrative extraction from texts offers a compelling approach to this problem by automatically identifying the sub-set of interconnected raw documents, extracting the critical narrative/story elements, and representing them in a more adequate manner that conveys the key points of the story in an easy to understand format to the readers. This could be done through text summarization [13], timelines [15, 19], word clouds [3, 20], visual textual analytics [7, 18] or in an intermediate structured formalism (e.g., wiki-like page structures [1]) that can feed further steps (e.g., gamification [6, 16] or story generation [12] (such as automatically generating finance [5, 11] and sport reports [22])).",

In addition to this, we also edited the Text2Story Special Issue on IPM Journal [10] which had more than 30 submissions and 8 papers accepted, demonstrating the growing activity of this specific research area. The organizers of the workshop have also been actively involved in this research area with the proposal and the contribution of new methods and solutions, most notably the YAKE! keyword extraction algorithm [2\u20134] - best short paper of ECIR\u201918 - and the Tell me Stories temporal summarization tool [15] - best demo presentation at ECIR\u201919.",
