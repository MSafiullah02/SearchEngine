On the one hand, the relatively simple makeup of most viruses renders them particularly well tractable by reductionist approaches. Consider, for example, the simple and beautiful geometry of eicosahedral capsids, the interwoven and overlapping reading frames of retroviral genomes, or the highly focused strategies by which oncogenic papova viruses subvert the cell cycle. All of these are examples of very functional \u2013 and yet disarmingly minimalist \u2013 aspects of viral life. Typically, there is no \u2018junk DNA\u2019 to deal with; every single nucleotide has a precise raison d\u2019\u00eatre, which can thankfully be analyzed in all due detail by forward or reverse genetics.",

This series of state-of-the-art reviews on virus\u2013host interactions strives to disseminate virological knowledge \u2013 which in turn may confer a competitive advantage to the human host. The individual articles have been written by leaders of their respective fields, and represent a cross-sectional report on the current state of knowledge for a selection of RNA viruses: foamy viruses, HIV, and the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The issue is rounded by a discussion of novel concepts in antiviral immunity, and by a synopsis of viruses that elicit psychotropic effects in their hosts.",

Originally named after the dramatic cytopathic effects observed on foamy-virus infected cultured cells, they appear to be highly prevalent in non-human primates. Based on the severe neurodegeneration observed in transgenic mice expressing human foamy virus (HFV) regulatory proteins [1], many observers including myself have suspected that HFV may be responsible for neurological diseases of primates 2., 3.. However, over the ensuing decade it has not been possible to substantiate this suspicion, and HFV remains a virus in search of a disease [4]. This is \u2013 of course \u2013 excellent news for the unfortunate zoo technicians who have contracted HFV infection from monkey bites. Besides, that HFV may not be all that neuropathogenic after all, enhances the prospects for the proposal presented by Saib and colleagues that HFV may be used as a vector for gene therapy. Before that prospect can become reality, many issues will need to be ironed out, not least the fact that the function of some of the most abundant gene products of HFV continues to be unknown.",

The review by Trkola leads us through the virus\u2019 travel within the host cell, and discusses progress in understanding each step in the viral life cycle. For all the research on the functional significance of HIV gene products, large areas remain nebulous. The biggest mystery, in my opinion, continues to surround the Nef regulatory factor. Although Nef is indispensable for pathogenicity in vivo\n[5], its precise mode of action, its cellular partners, and the relative importance of the many functions ascribed to Nef, are still elusive.",

In more than one way, the SARS pandemic epitomizes the new risks arising from the combination of highly infectious emerging pathogens with the limitless exchange and travel in the \u2018global village\u2019. Alternatively, the SARS epidemic can be viewed as a fantastic success story of modern infectology. The clinical case definition of SARS was identified very quickly, mainly because of the heroic commitment of the late Dr. Carlo Urbani (for an account of Urbani\u2019s remarkable work and untimely death, see http://www.aicu.it/carlourbani.asp). A wave of panic arose in South East Asia, and the effects for that region were devastating. The gross domestic product of Taiwan, at the peak of the epidemic, went down to zero \u2013 as 170,000 citizens were isolated in an eventually successful effort to contain viral spread. The molecular identity of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was established in record time. After some initial problems mainly in South China, the cooperation between scientists and health authorities worked seamlessly and ensured containment of the epidemic. The development of antiviral vaccines is arguably among the most impressive success stories in medicine, and advanced efforts are now underway to produce effective vaccines against SARS-CoV.",

That viruses can be psychotropic is by no means a novel concept: think for example of rabies infection, which has been known to cause \u2018hydrophobia\u2019 since ancient times. The synopsis of Lipkin and Hornig shows that psychotropic effects may represent the rule rather than an exception in viral infections. Certain syndromes are undisputed and extremely well documented: these include the AIDS-dementia syndrome [6] and the devastating and irreversible hippocampal syndromes brought about by Herpes simplex encephalitis. In other diseases, the situation is murkier and sometimes just conjectural. It has been speculated many times that at least some forms of schizophrenia and of major depression may be of viral origin: the equine Borna Disease Virus (BDV), the molecular definition of which Ian Lipkin has contributed significantly 7., 8., has surfaced as a candidate pathogen time and time again. However, incontrovertible evidence is still lacking. The authors enumerate the evidence in favor and against each of these arguments, and provide some insight into ongoing (hitherto unpublished) efforts at clarifying some of these possible pathogenetic links.",

The traditional view maintained that immunity occurs in two ways: an adaptive sophisticated, immensely effective clonal immune response, and an innate, brachial and primitive response that provides an approximate and barely functional first line of defense. Needless to say, the discovery of pathogen-associated molecular patterning receptors, such as the rapidly growing family of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [9], has significantly altered that perception: we now know that the innate immune system is much more sophisticated than had been suspected. The current enthusiasm for TLR immunotherapies (of everything, from pathogens to cancer) may be excessive: TLR stimulation is a potent double-edged sword, and in our own experience chronic administration of TLR agonist can be severely counterproductive [10].",

A delicate equilibrium between viral mutagenesis and the induction of broadly specific \u2018public antibodies\u2019 allows for the development of viral escape variants \u2013 until the viral quasispecies collapses because of replicational error catastrophe. After describing their elegant analysis of viral\u2013host interplays in the model system of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), the authors attempt to draw some enticing generalizations.
