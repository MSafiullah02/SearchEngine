            "text": "Blood monocytes are major in vivo cell targets of HIV\u20101 infection. They are known to be less susceptible to viral cytopathic effects and more resistant to HIV\u20101\u2010induced apoptosis than CD4+ T lymphocytes (Herbein et al., 2002; Kedzierska et al., 2003). Due to their ability to survive HIV\u20101 infection, and because of a chronic low\u2010level viral infection, monocytes serve as a major virus reservoir (Ho et al., 1994). Activation of monocytes by infectious and/or inflammatory stimuli increases plasma viral load (Donovan et al., 1996; Goletti et al., 1996) combined with increased numbers of HIV\u20101\u2010positive cells. In addition, activated monocytes can traffic and invade tissues and organs, homing to sites of infection and inflammation (Fischer\u2010Smith et al., 2001). Productively infected monocytes may therefore ultimately serve as \u2018Trojan horses\u2019 for viral dissemination to different organs. Furthermore, a monocyte\u2010dependent mechanism of viral amplification at local sites of initial infection appears to be a prerequisite for efficient dissemination of infection (Hirsch et al., 1998). The analysis of infected monocytes reveals evidence of signalling cascades leading to upregulation of specific inflammation\u2010related molecules, which include MCP\u20101 (Wahl et al., 2003). MCP\u20101 plays an important role in sustaining both inflammation and HIV\u20101 replication (Fantuzzi et al., 2003) and is also involved in mass recruitment of such HIV\u20101 targets as dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages and T lymphocytes, into localized sites of infection (Cinque et al., 1998; Fantuzzi et al., 2000; Alfano and Poli, 2001). The pro\u2010HIV\u20101 role of MCP\u20101 has been confirmed by the recent finding that HIV\u20101 infection and disease progression are influenced by a mutant MCP\u20101 allele linked to increased monocyte infiltration of tissues and MCP\u20101 levels (Gonzalez et al., 2002). Considerable attention should therefore be given to the mechanisms triggered by HIV\u20101 to induce enhanced MCP\u20101 production by monocytes.",

            "text": "The HIV\u20101 matrix protein p17 is a structural protein that plays an important part in the life cycle of the retrovirus (Fiorentini et al., 2006). It is released by infected cells (Fiorentini et al., 2006), and has recently been shown to accumulates in lymph nodes in the absence of any detectable HIV\u20101 replication (Popovic et al., 2005). HIV\u20101 p17, as a recombinant protein, exerts a cytokine\u2010like activity after binding to a specific cellular receptor (p17R) (De Francesco et al., 2002). It is able to modulate the activation and proliferation status of T and NK cells (De Francesco et al., 1998; Vitale et al., 2003) and to enhance HIV\u20101 replication (De Francesco et al., 1998). Moreover, it increases the release of such pro\u2010inflammatory molecules as TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b3, while counteracting the anti\u2010inflammatory activity of IL\u20104 (De Francesco et al., 2002). It is likely that, through the release of pro\u2010inflammatory molecules, p17 may induce the activation of monocytes and modulate their functions. However, the potential direct effect of p17 on monocytes has not yet been investigated.",

As shown in Fig. 1A (left), cell staining with monoclonal antibody (mAb) to CD14 revealed that almost all monocytes constitutively expressed p17Rs on their surface. The presence of p17Rs on human monocytes was confirmed on cells purified by magnetic sorting using anti\u2010CD14\u2010coated paramagnetic beads as a specific reagent (Fig. 1A, right). The specificity of the binding was confirmed by displacement of p17/p17R interaction by the anti\u2010p17 mAb MBS\u20103 (data not shown). The stability of the p17R+ phenotype was then evaluated in purified monocyte preparations. Almost 100% of monocytes showed a p17R+ phenotype after 72 h of culture, with a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) similar to or even higher than that observed on cells soon after their purification (Fig. 1A, right). At the same time, we observed a consistent increase in the MFI of p17Rs expressed on cells stimulated for 16 h with IFN\u2010\u03b3 or LPS. As shown in Fig. 1B (top), IFN\u2010\u03b3 increased the expression of p17Rs on purified monocytes already at a dose as low as 0.2 ng ml\u22121. A peak of p17R expression was reached at an IFN\u2010\u03b3 dose of 25 ng ml\u22121. LPS was less efficient than IFN\u2010\u03b3 in upregulating p17Rs expression. A peak in p17R expression was observed at an LPS dose of 10 ng ml\u22121. A kinetic analysis of p17R expression on IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010 or LPS\u2010activated monocytes (i.e. 1, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 h) showed that p17R expression was enhanced on monocytes within 8\u201324 h (Fig. 1B, bottom). The slow surface induction of p17Rs is therefore indicative of the de novo synthesis of p17Rs following monocyte activation.",

Another cell surface receptor, namely HLA\u2010DR, was included for comparison because of its high stability (Lanzavecchia et al., 1992) and known recycling kinetics in allophycocyanin (APC) (Tulp et al., 1994). As shown in Fig. 2A, cells treated with cycloheximide showed a downregulation of p17R surface expression to the background levels after 24 h of culture. In comparison with the HLA\u2010DR molecule, whose expression on the surface of monocytes was not affected, as expected, by cycloheximide, p17R clearly showed an accelerated turnover which suggests that a de novo synthesis is required to maintain its normal expression level.",

To assess the mechanism(s) whereby p17 induces an increase in MCP\u20101 gene expression, we verified whether p17 treatment increases NF\u2010\u03baB and AP\u20101 DNA\u2010binding activity. Preliminary experiments were run using the TransSignal Array, a protein/DNA array that includes, among others, specific probes for these two transcriptional factors. As shown in Fig. 4A, nuclear extracts from untreated monocytes showed a basal level of AP\u20101 DNA\u2010binding activity that was enhanced after p17 treatment for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Conversely, treatment of monocytes with p17 did not modify NF\u2010\u03baB DNA\u2010binding activity which, however, is present at low levels under basal conditions. Data obtained by protein/DNA array analysis were confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Preliminary experiments using p17 at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 showed that p17 activated AP\u20101 DNA\u2010binding activity in a dose\u2010dependent manner with a peak at the 0.4\u20130.5 \u03bcg ml\u22121 dose (data not shown). Time\u2010course analysis using 1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 p17 showed that the activation of AP\u20101\u2010binding activity is also time\u2010dependent and peaks (approximately a threefold increase) at 1 h after the beginning of p17 treatment, after which it declines (Fig. 4B). The specificity of protein\u2013DNA complexes was confirmed by competition experiments using an excess of specific unlabelled oligonucleotide. As AP\u20101 proteins bind to DNA as homo\u2010 or heterodimers of the Jun (c\u2010Jun, JunD and JunB) and Fos (c\u2010Fos, Fra1, Fra2 and FosB) proto\u2010oncogene families, experiments were performed to characterize the proteins involved in p17\u2010induced AP\u20101 protein\u2013DNA complexes.

Results from EMSA experiments showed that treatment of THP\u20101 cells for 4 h at 37\u00b0C with p17 (1 \u03bcg ml\u22121) induced AP\u20101 activation, with a peak (5.2\u2010fold increase) at 1 h after treatment, but did not induce any NF\u2010\u03baB activation (Fig. 5A). EMSA experiments showed that pre\u2010treatment of exogenous p17 protein with the neutralizing anti\u2010p17 mAb MBS\u20103 blocked AP\u20101 activation (data not shown). Further analyses were performed to characterize the specificity and protein composition of AP\u20101 complexes induced by p17 treatment in THP\u20101 cells. TransAM\u2122 analysis showed a preferential involvement of c\u2010Fos and JunB in the active AP\u20101 complexes (Fig. 5B). Altogether, our results confirm a similar AP\u20101 activation pattern by p17 in human primary monocytes and THP\u20101 cells, which suggests that this cell line may be used as a model in future studies of the biological activity of p17 in the monocyte compartment. THP\u20101 cells were also used as a target to assess the stability of p17 to heat or enzymatic degradation. We therefore treated exogenous p17 with 1% trypsin for 1 h at 37\u00b0C or boiled it for 15 min at 100\u00b0C. Both treatments completely abolished p17\u2010induced AP\u20101 activity as assessed by EMSA (Fig. 5C), providing evidences that the viral protein is sensitive to protease and heat denaturation.",

To investigate which regions are involved in the transcriptional activation of MCP\u20101 by p17, primary monocytes were transfected with different plasmids containing the reporter luciferase gene cloned downstream to the MCP\u20101 promoter. MCP\u20101 promoter luciferase reporter plasmids used included: pGLM\u2010PRM containing the proximal promoter region of the MCP\u20101 gene, pGLM\u2010ENH, which contains both the proximal promoter and the distal enhancer regions, pGLM\u2010PRM\u2010P2mut mutated into the P2 AP\u20101 binding site, and phMCP128, a plasmid containing a MCP\u20101 proximal promoter region whose AP\u20101 binding sites (P2 and P3) have been deleted (Fig. 6A). Flow cytometric analysis of cells transfected with a control GFP\u2010encoding plasmid (pmax\u2010GFP) showed a high transfection efficiency of primary monocyte with over 40% of the viable cells expressing GFP as early as 8 h after pmax\u2010GFP plasmid transfection (Fig. 6B). Soon after transfection, cells were left untreated or treated with p17 (1 \u03bcg ml\u22121). PMA (20 ng ml\u22121) or TNF\u2010\u03b1 (10 ng ml\u22121) was used as controls of NF\u2010\u03baB and AP\u20101 activation. PMA and TNF\u2010\u03b1 resulted in a significant transcriptional activation (3.9\u2010 and 2.2\u2010fold respectively) in cells transfected with the pGLM\u2010ENH plasmid, in which both the MCP\u20101 promoter and enhancer regions are present (not shown). In p17\u2010treated monocytes the luciferase activity of constructs pGLM\u2010ENH and pGLM\u2010PRM was induced approximately twofold (Fig. 6C). The lack of difference between the promoter and the enhancer regions in response to p17, despite the potential AP\u20101 binding site in the enhancer region, indicates a critical role for AP\u20101 binding sites in the promoter region. Indeed, deletion of both AP\u20101 binding sites (phMCP128) resulted in complete loss of p17\u2010induced activation. To further assess whether p17\u2010induced MCP\u20101 expression was dependent on the P2 or P3 AP\u20101 binding site, we mutated the P2 region in the pGLM\u2010PRM plasmid (pGLM\u2010PRM\u2010P2mut) and tested for p17 activation. Treatment with p17 resulted in luciferase expression in both cells transfected with the pGML\u2010PRM or pGML\u2010PRM\u2010P2mut plasmids. This finding suggests that the P3 AP\u20101 binding site in the promoter region is necessary for optimal p17 stimulation.",

An increasing amount of evidence shows a tight link between activated monocytes recruitment, MCP\u20101 release and HIV\u20101 pathogenesis, especially in AIDS patients suffering from HIV\u20101\u2010associated dementia (HAD). The selective accumulation of MCP\u20101 in the cerebrospinal fluid of AIDS patients with HAD, together with the finding that MCP\u20101 levels correlate with the degree of dementia (Cinque et al., 1998; Conant et al., 1998; Kelder et al., 1998), substantiates a possible role of MCP\u20101 in neuropathogenesis. It is worth noting that the presence of activated monocytes in the brain is a better correlate of HAD than the extent of viral infection (Glass et al., 1995). A chronic inflammatory state of circulating monocytes emerges over time also in HIV\u20101 patients receiving highly active anti\u2010retroviral therapy (HAART). In particular, these elements evolve to a chronic inflammatory state characterized by an increase in chemotactic macrophage markers and a more mature (monocyte/macrophage hybrid) profile (Pulliam et al., 1997; 2004). Considerable interest is focused therefore on the mechanism by which HIV\u20101 makes active to induce dysregulation of monocyte activity. Understanding this mechanism will contribute to further identify the linkage between HIV\u20101 infection and monocyte activation and, ultimately, to achieve improved control over the replication and spread of the virus, and of the prevention and treatment of immune disorders.",

Yet the blocking of HIV\u20101 replication is not linked to a complete recovery from immune dysfunction, thus suggesting that mechanisms other than active viral replication are involved in chronic immune perturbation. Structural HIV\u20101 proteins have been associated with immune activation and loss of functional competence by different immune cells (Quaranta et al., 2004). Among these, the HIV\u20101 matrix protein p17 has been recently identified as a critical determinant in AIDS pathogenesis as it binds to a cellular receptor expressed on immune cells and enhances viral replication and infectivity (De Francesco et al., 1998), through a combination of different effector functions (De Francesco et al., 2002; Vitale et al., 2003). This structural viral protein accumulates and persists in the lymph nodes of patients under HAART (Popovic et al., 2005). Moreover, amounts of the HIV\u20101 protein did not noticeably differ in lymph nodes specimens either before initiation of therapy or during treatment where the virus burden significantly decreased. This finding strongly suggests that p17 persists in patients under HAART for a long time in the absence of detectable virus replication making conceivable that their chronic activity on immune cells can lead to immune dysfunction. Furthermore, we have recently shown that p17 is released by infected cells (Fiorentini et al., 2006) and can be detected in sera obtained from HIV\u20101\u2010infected patients using a newly developed p17 capture immunoassay (S. Fiorentini et al., in preparation). The pro\u2010inflammatory role for p17 is suggested by its ability to induce TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 expression on T cells and to counteract the anti\u2010inflammatory activity of IL\u20104 (De Francesco et al., 2002). In the present study we have described the ability of the HIV\u20101 matrix protein p17 to perturb the biological activity of primary monocytes, by selectively inducing increased MCP\u20101 production and release. This process is mediated by the expression of p17Rs on the monocyte surface.",

Accordingly, p17 activity is observed only after pre\u2010activation of T cells with mitogens, which per se exert a biological effect. The in vitro biological activity of p17 has therefore been described so far as a synergistic effect that cannot be completely separated from that triggered by the mitogen itself. This study shows that circulating monocytes constitutively express p17Rs on their surface and for the first time furthers our understanding of signalling triggered by p17/p17R interaction.",

            "text": "Several signalling pathways have been hypothesized for the transcriptional regulation of MCP\u20101. In the human MCP\u20101 gene, TRE and \u03baB enhancer elements exist in the 5\u2032\u2010flanking region of MCP\u20101 gene, thus suggesting a role for AP\u20101 and NF\u2010\u03baB (Shyy et al., 1993). We therefore decided to use the primary human monocyte model to assess p17 signal transduction pathways involved in MCP\u20101 gene expression. EMSA revealed that p17 does not cause significant changes to the DNA\u2010binding activity of NF\u2010\u03baB, whereas it increases AP\u20101 binding in a time\u2010 and dose\u2010dependent manner. Induction of AP\u20101 in both primary human monocytes and THP\u20101 cells was associated with increased levels of c\u2010Fos and JunB proteins in the active AP\u20101 complexes. These results indicate that the p17\u2010induced AP\u20101 complexes responsible for the MCP\u20101 transcriptional activity are likely to be c\u2010Fos/JunB heterodimers. Deletion of AP\u20101 binding sites in the enhancer region of human MCP\u20101 (P1) or mutation of the P2 AP\u20101 binding site in the MCP\u20101 proximal promoter region had no effect on the transcriptional activity in response to p17. Instead, deletion of both AP\u20101 binding sites (P2 and P3) in the promoter region resulted in reduced p17\u2010induced MCP\u20101 gene transcription levels, close to basal transcription values. Such evidence suggests that the upregulation of MCP\u20101 transcription in human monocytes by p17 may depend on AP\u20101 activation and binding to the P3 site in the MCP\u20101 proximal promoter region. However, a direct evidence for the involvement of the P3 AP\u20101 binding site in p17\u2010triggered MCP\u20101 transcription is still lacking, as all our efforts to obtain a MCP\u20101 promoter\u2013luciferase construct containing a mutated P3 AP\u20101 binding site were unsuccessful.",

Moreover, Cho et al. (2002) and Lim and Garzino\u2010Demo (1999) have clearly shown that the P3 AP\u20101 binding site abolished inducible MCP\u20101 promoter activity in human endothelial cells and human astrocytoma cells (U\u201087) respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that, at least in certain cells, AP\u20101 activation can circumvent the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway by means of different signal transduction pathways leading to the induction of the MCP\u20101 gene. Interestingly, our experiments show a peak of AP\u20101 activation at 1 h after p17 stimulation and persists, at lower levels, up to 4 h. At the same time, MCP\u20101 transcripts increase at 4 h after p17 treatment reaching a plateau at 6 h of stimulation. The kinetics of AP\u20101 activation does not apparently well correlate with induction of MCP\u20101 gene. This finding may reflect the capability of p17 to trigger an unusual pathway that induce AP\u20101 binding to the MCP\u20101 promoter leading to the production of MCP\u20101 transcripts but also to their stabilization, ultimately allowing their accumulation. Indeed, it is well known that regulation of MCP\u20101 transcription is due to both gene transcription activation and mRNA post\u2010transcriptional stabilization. Different studies have demonstrated that, upon different exogenous stimuli, MCP\u20101 mRNA half\u2010life increases to 3 h while anti\u2010inflammatory molecules may reduce it to 15 min (Poon et al., 1999; Dhawan et al., 2007). On the other hand, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that p17 may activate other transcription factors that cooperate with AP\u20101 to determine the prolonged activation of MCP\u20101 transcription.",

In some cases, the viral protein responsible for AP\u20101 activation has been identified, e.g. the hepatitis B virus X protein (Tanaka et al., 2006), the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (He et al., 2003), the papilloma virus E2 protein (Behren et al., 2005), the Epstein\u2013Barr virus latent protein 1 and the parvovirus non\u2010structural protein (NS) 1 (Kieser et al., 1997). The common exploitation of the AP\u20101 pathway points to the wider role of this signalling event and of its downstream gene targets in viral infections. In the case of HIV\u20101, AP\u20101 activation is a redundant phenomenon, being performed by such viral proteins as tat (Kumar et al., 1998), nef (Biggs et al., 1999), gp120 (Gibellini et al., 1999), vpr (Varin et al., 2005) and, as shown here, by the matrix protein p17. In the case of HIV\u20101, AP\u20101 activation may not only enhance viral replication via trans\u2010activation of the HIV\u20101\u2010LTR (Rabbi et al., 1997) but, as demonstrated above for p17, it may also modulate the expression of cellular genes. These effects could not only promote HIV\u20101 infection but also lead to functional defects and pathogenetic events, as demonstrated for MCP\u20101 and its contribution to the pathogenesis of AIDS dementia. Our results suggest that it is necessary to block the biological activity of the HIV\u20101 proteins (including p17) continuously released by infected cells despite the successful blocking of viral replication obtained by HAART. At the same time, the knowledge that p17 induces monocytes to produce MCP\u20101 by activating the transcriptional factor AP\u20101 should be followed up by new anti\u2010HIV\u20101 therapeutic strategies capable of neutralizing the functions of molecules induced by the HIV\u20101 proteins which are known contributors to virulence and pathogenesis.",
