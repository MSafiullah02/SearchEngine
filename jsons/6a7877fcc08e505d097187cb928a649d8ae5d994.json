Positive viral episodes were associated with clinical symptoms (89% vs 43%), more frequent antibiotic treatment (44% vs 15%) or hospital admission (22% vs 0%) than negative ones. Patients with positive viral detection showed impaired lung function, with lower FEV1 and FVC values. Conclusions: In our experience, viral respiratory tract infections can cause significant respiratory symptoms and impaired lung function, in children with HID, despite immunoglobulin replacement therapy. These patients could benefit from the monitoring of viral infections, as these may be a gateway for ongoing lung damage.

[2] [3] [4] [5] Immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IRT) reduces the frequency of these infections. However, despite adequate IRT, recurrent respiratory infections are still one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in these patients. [2] [3] [4] Little data are currently available regarding the susceptibility to respiratory viruses of hypogammaglobulinemic patients receiving IRT. 4, 6, 7 However, some other viruses have been described which play significant roles in these patients. [8] [9] [10] [11] Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) has been associated with granulomatous/lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD) in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), 8 and enterovirus is a known cause of fatal meningoencephalitis in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). 9, 10 In addition, there are several recent reports showing an increased susceptibility to viral respiratory infections in adults with CVID receiving IRT, 4-7 that can contribute to chronic and persistent pulmonary inflammation. 2, 7 We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first study that analyses respiratory viruses in pediatric patients with predominantly antibody deficiency who required IRT, considering their relationship with clinical symptoms and pulmonary function, bacterial co-infection, treatment and outcomes.",

On the other hand, other authors have hypothesized that persistent and recurrent viral respiratory infections could adversely affect the microbiome, leading to an increased bacterial density in children's nasopharyngeal tract, predisposing to sinopulmonary bacterial infections. 17, 18 As other authors, 4 we recommend screening for viral infection in children with HID and acute respiratory symptoms to avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment. However, viral testing is routinely performed only in children with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). 1, 4 Regarding HID, protocols present a great deal of variation across Europe in the management of lung complications. 19 There is an urgent need for consensus guidelines on how to monitor lung complications and how to treat respiratory infections in HID patients. 19 Not all our patients were typical HID such as XLA or CVID. Three of our cases were SCID patients who had received a hematopoietic cell transplant, but presented persistent B-cell lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia. Although most children with SCID recover cellular immunity 1 year after transplantation, many patients are likely to be on IRT for a considerable period until full reconstitution of B-cell immunity has been achieved. 20,21 B-cell immune reconstitution and its consequences regarding viral respiratory infections have not been deeply investigated in these patients. Our data support that these patients are also prone to viral respiratory infections, which impact lung function and lead to antibiotic consumption. Another patient was an AD-HIES. Regarding humoral immunity, many patients with AD-HIES require immunoglobulin infusions due to memory B-cell lymphopenia and decline in specific antibody titers. 22 Recurrent respiratory tract infections have been described in these children, and more than 90% of them develop pneumonia. 22 Although bacteria are detected in 44% of respiratory exacerbations, viral pneumonia has also been reported. 22 Lung sequelae in these patients are frequent, mainly as bronchiectasis. 22 Thus, monitoring viral infections in these children may be important.",

In our experience, presence of respiratory symptoms, negative bacterial sputum culture, impaired lung function, antibiotic prescription, and hospital admission were significantly associated with viral detection.Some authors have already reported how respiratory viral infections seem to play a role in adults with HID.[7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] These studies have reported viral detection rates in 41-56% of respiratory exacerbations, being rhinovirus the most frequently identified.4,5,7 These episodes are more frequently symptomatic in HID patients compared to healthy controls, 6,7 as we have observed.However, the role of viral respiratory infections in children with HID has hardly been analyzed, and the mechanisms of increased susceptibility to some viral respiratory infections in these patients are not well known.17 IRT may not offer protection at the mucosal surface, as IgA and IgM are not replaced with immunoglobulin products.4 IgM is highly effective for agglutination, especially of viruses.17 In addition, Duraisingham et al observed that patients with HID and respiratory viral infection presented lower levels of IgA than patients with negative viral results. 4 In our series, patients with positive viral detection presented adequate IgG levels, but very low IgA levels, which could favor these infections. Some authors have also suggested that antibodies originating in the lymphatic tissue of the respiratory mucosa may play a more important role than systemic antibodies against pulmonary and sinus infection. 3,17 In addition, persistent viral infections could result in chronic antigen stimulation in the context of a dysregulated immune system, and could exacerbate inflammatory disorders. 4,7 In our study, bacterial sputum cultures were more frequently positive in children with negative virological tests. However, antibiotic prescription was higher in patients with viral respiratory infection, as an important percentage of our patients with positive viral episodes associated respiratory symptoms, and the results of viral tests were not available early during the episode. Duraisingham et al observed that most positive viral samples of their study were obtained from patients with negative bacteriologic results. 4 Sperlich et al also reported that viruses are commonly present in adults with CVID and upper respiratory tract symptoms that respond poorly to antibiotics, 5 suggesting that antibiotic usage could be better targeted.",

We have included a small number of patients who suffer from different types of HID with varying molecular mechanisms. Despite the heterogeneity of the cases, our results indicate the significant role of viral respiratory infections in these children, in terms of clinical symptoms, lung function, antibiotic prescription, and hospital admission. We have also observed that viral isolation is more frequently associated with symptoms in cases compared with healthy controls although both groups are different in terms of age and immunity and do not allow direct comparisons. Further studies should ideally include age-matched healthy controls, to better assess the impact of viral infections in children with humoral immunodeficiency. However, Peltola et al6 have reported that the duration of symptoms and of rhinovirus shedding was longer in adults with HID than in healthy children. For this reason, we expect that respiratory viruses might cause more symptoms in these patients compared with healthy children, although we have not been able to prove it.
