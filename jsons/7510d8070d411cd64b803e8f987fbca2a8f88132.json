            "text": "Object The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of society globally. As healthcare resources had to be preserved for infected patients, and the risk of in-hospital procedures escalated for uninfected patients and staff, neurosurgeons around the world have had to postpone non-emergent procedures. Under these unprecedented conditions, the decision to defer cases became increasingly difficult as COVID-19 cases skyrocketed. Methods Data was collected by self-reporting surveys during two discrete periods: the principal survey accrued responses during 2 weeks at the peak of the global pandemic, and the supplemental survey accrued responses after that to detect changes in opinions and circumstances. Nine hypothetical surgical scenarios were used to query neurosurgeons' opinion on the risk of postponement and the urgency to re-schedule the procedures. An acuity index was generated for each scenario, and this was used to rank the nine cases. Results There were 494 respondents to the principal survey from 60 countries. 258 (52.5%) reported that all elective cases and clinics have been shut down by their main hospital. A total of 226 respondents (46.1%) reported that their operative volume had dropped more than 50%. For the countries most affected by COVID-19, this proportion was 54.7%. There was a high degree of agreement among our respondents that fast-evolving neuro-oncological cases are non-emergent cases that nonetheless have the highest risk in postponement, and selected vascular cases may have high acuity as well. Conclusion We report on the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgeons around the world. From their ranking of the nine case scenarios, we deduced a strategic scheme that can serve as a guideline to triage non-emergent neurosurgical procedures during the pandemic. With it, hopefully, neurosurgeons can continue to serve their patients without endangering them either neurologically or risking their exposure to the deadly virus.",

On a systems level, teams of neurosurgeons have been re-deployed as intensivists, neurosurgical patients have been re-housed in COVID-clean wards, protocols have been implemented to test patients ahead of neurosurgical procedures, and hospital systems have been reorganized to \"hub-and-spoke\" configurations to segregate neurosurgery to designated centers [4] [5] [6] .",

As hospitals tried to conserve precise resources for the tsunami of patients, governments worked to protect uninfected citizens, and medical societies strived to support physicians and nurses, neurosurgeons have been mandated to drastically alter their practices as the entire world mobilized to combat SARS-CoV-2. On March 13, 2020, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) issued an unprecedented recommendation to \"minimize, postpone or cancel electively scheduled operations\" [7] . As COVID-19 cases skyrocketed in the USA that week, the American Hospital Association and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services quickly followed the ACS and issued similar recommendations [8] [9] [10] . Intuitively rational, medically sound, and worded respectful of the decision-making skills well-honed over decades of training, these recommendations nonetheless confounded neurosurgeons as they left the definition of \"elective\" to each individual practitioner.",

There were 315 respondents. An \"urgency score\" was generated by converting each response into a number from 1 to 5.

Despite thorough searches, we were unable to locate the scale in any published studies, and moreover, the application of the scale to neurosurgery is questionable since a single, massively-broad description, \"Neurosurgery,\" was placed in \"Tier 3a: do not postpone.\" The EANS published an \"Adapted Elective Surgery Acuity Scale\" [17] which is more helpful, but even in this, procedures are grouped in a large disease categories such as \"unruptured aneurysm,\" which incidentally is in Tier 2 \"postpone if possible.\" Since not all unruptured aneurysms are alike, there remains a vast amount of ambiguity. Applying this scale to our 9 scenarios, the C45 stenosis case in our study, in 6th place in the acuity rank per our respondents (Table 5) , would have been placed in tier 1 and postponed indefinitely, whereas the pituitary adenoma and vestibular schwannoma, in the 7th and 9th ranks, would have been placed in tier 2 and gone ahead of it. The giant aneurysm, in the 2nd position in our acuity rank just behind the cerebellar metastasis, would have been in tier 2 and postponed for treatment, while the AVM, in the 8th position, would also be in tier 2 indistinguishable from the aneurysm.",

One can apply these two lines of thinking to any clinical scenario and place the result as a marker on Fig. 3 . If the marker lands in blue, then the procedure can reasonably be postponed until the end of the pandemic. If red, the operation should probably happen soon. A marker in purple denotes a case that can be postponed until hospital resources, as well as personnel and patient safety are reasonably assured. Since trauma procedures have dropped significantly as a side-effect of social distancing [5, 6] , it not unreasonable to believe that when \"flattening the curve\" finally happens, some of the cases landing the purple zone can proceed before they turn into emergencies.",

The rank of the AI in the group of nine cases is shown in parenthesis. The PAI 166 was calculated for each case as follows: for each respondent who identifiably completed both parts of the study, the risk score (principal phase) was multiplied to same respondent's urgency score for the same case (supplement phase) to generate a personal acuity index (PAI) for that case. The average for the 166 respondents was recorded under PAI 166 (9) 6.28 (9) for who takes the survey. To help overcome these limitations, private social media networks were utilized specifically targeting international neurosurgeons to participate in the surveys. As with all studies involving surveys from volunteers, selection bias is hard to avoid and may not necessarily represent majority opinions of every neurosurgeon around the world. As polling does for elections, this study only \"spot checks\" the opinions of neurosurgeons and their practice conditions. Among the respondents, the proportion of early-career neurosurgeons was greater than those with more experience. It is likely that some respondents interpreted the \"years in neurosurgery\" question to mean post-training, even though the survey was meant to include trainees. Fortunately, as pointed out in the results section, excluding neurosurgeons who reported \"0-8 years\" in the field did not alter the scores significantly.",

To care for the massive numbers of COVID patients, many hospital systems and surgeons are focused on conserving resources by limiting elective surgical procedures. During this study, conducted during the peak of the pandemic in Western Europe, we sought to determine how COVID-19 has disrupted the practice of neurosurgeons globally and affected the decision-making in triaging neurosurgical cases. A majority of respondents reported that all elective cases and clinics were re-scheduled. Government policy for strict social distancing and higher number of COVID-19 cases were predictors of hospital policy and neurosurgeons' views on canceling cases, while \"for-profit\" practices and neurosurgeons in LMIC were less likely to experience strict hospital mandates for postponement. The survey Fig. 3 A proposed strategic scheme. The scheme consists of two orthogonal lines of thinking, one related to the next predictable adverse event (either from disease progression or by chance), and the other related to the timing of this event. The nine case scenarios, A-I, are plotted onto the field according to the average \"risk score\" and \"urgency score\" generated from our study ( Table 5 ). Numbers in field: estimated acuity index responses to non-emergent case scenarios were used to develop an acuity index, which indicated that neuro-oncology cases, as well as select vascular cases, have high acuity. A strategic scheme was created as a possible guideline for sensible triaging of non-emergent neurosurgical cases, so that global neurosurgeons can continue to serve their patients without harming them either neurologically through delaying surgery, or by unnecessarily exposing them to the deadly virus at the pinnacle of the COVID tide.",
