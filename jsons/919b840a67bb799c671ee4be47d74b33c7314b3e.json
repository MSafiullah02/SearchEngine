            "text": "Intensive care has evolved over its 60-year history to yield previously unimaginable recovery from major trauma, multiorgan system failure, and extensive surgery, including organ transplantation. Antimicrobial therapy plays an essential role in combating invasive infections in the intensive care population that are often the ultimate cause of death. However, a parallel evolution of microbial compensation occurs, engendering resistance and virulence mechanisms to circumvent each new antimicrobial agent-penicillin resistance existed before the drug became commercially available. The surgical intensive care unit provides the ultimate microcosm for antimicrobial resistance development, juxtaposing complex and severe underlying illness with invasive devices, bypassed defenses, and compromised tissues, as well as proximity to other high-risk patients, all in one intimate environment. New resistance mechanisms may be introduced from referring institutions or can emerge in response to therapeutics, and then may spread to others within or outside the ICU. Multidrug-resistant organisms, promoted by excessive or suboptimal antimicrobial use, have become a dominant concern in modern healthcare, most notably in the intensive care setting; a directed, judicious, but strategic response is essential to both short-and long-term success.",

In a provocative and edifying study, Hranjec and colleagues describe aggressive versus conservative approaches to suspected infection [ 26 ] . Using a quasiexperimental before-and-after design, they examined nearly 1500 admissions to the University of Virginia surgical ICU. In the fi rst year empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated immediately after obtaining cultures. In the second year a more conservative approach was taken, withholding antibiotics from clinically stable patients until there was objective evidence confi rming infection. The conservative approach was associated with more initially appropriate therapy, shorter duration of therapy, and signifi cantly reduced mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.4 (95 % CI 0.25-0.67). Although rapid initiation of antibiotic therapy in response to sepsis is essential [ 8 ] , these results suggest that for the stable patient, a more conservative approach may yield improved mortality and better antimicrobial use. Confi rmation of this pilot study is needed. Table 33 .1 lists some of the common multidrug-resistant organisms encountered in the modern ICU. Prevalence of these problem organisms has been rising steadily, providing growing challenges [ 27 -29 ] .

Many patients who report allergy to penicillins do not react when rechallenged. Delineating the manifestations of purported allergy is valuable, as misattributed allergy relegates patients to alternate, and in many cases inferior, agents. In the past, crossover allergy to cephalosporins was estimated to occur in 7-14 % of patients with penicillin allergy, yet Pichichero estimates that this occurs only rarely, in about 0.5 % of those receiving fi rst-generation cephalosporins and almost never with upper generation cephalosporins [ 59 , 60 ] . Therefore, cephalosporins can be safely used in most patients reporting penicillin allergy, unless there is history of an immunoglobulin E-mediated reaction, such as anaphylaxis or angioedema. Cross-reactivity between penicillins and carbapenems is controversial, with previous estimates ranging from 0 to 50 %, but of uncertain signifi cance in clinical practice. In a study of 104 patients with IgE-mediated reactions to penicillin confi rmed by skin tests, only 1 (0.9 %) had an IgEmediated reaction to meropenem; the other 103 tolerated escalating doses without adverse effects [ 61 ] .",

He advocated the use of sharp dissection and fi ne sutures, gentle handling of tissues, and complete wound closure [ 66 ] . Over a century later, perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis is a vital adjunctive measure to these mainstays of infection prevention. Although the details of prophylaxis for elective surgery are altered in emergent operations on previously hospitalized ICU patients, the principles remain. The purpose of prophylaxis is to prevent intrinsic and extrinsic bacterial contamination of the surgical site that occurs during an operation from developing into a postoperative infection. The ideal prophylactic agent would be active against the major potential infecting agents; not induce resistance; effectively penetrate relevant tissues; have a long enough half-life to maintain effective levels throughout the procedure (re-dosing as necessary); have low toxicity and potential for allergy; have few interactions with anesthetic agents and muscle relaxants; and be cost effective [ 56 , 67 , 68 ] . It should be administered within an hour before the procedure (within 2 h for vancomycin and fl uoroquinolones) [ 69 ] . Postoperative doses provide no added benefi t. In a review of 28 studies there was no clear advantage to either multiple-or single-dose prophylaxis (odds ratio 1.06, 95 % CI, 0.89-1.25) [ 70 ] . Furthermore, unnecessary postoperative doses may cause harm, including allergy or anaphylaxis, prolonged bleeding times, C. diffi cile colitis, and selection of resistant organisms. This is particularly important in surgical ICU patients, who may require prolonged care and risk progressive acquisition of multidrug-resistant organisms [ 71 ] . Similarly, \"prophylaxis\" of drains, tubes, and catheters is both ineffective and hazardous, as is an attempt to \"maintain sterility of the wound\" [ 56 , 72 , 73 ] .",

Aminoglycosides have broad activity against Gram-negative organisms but are now less frequently used because of concerns about toxicity and the need for monitoring drug levels. For these reasons, however, they have regained activity against some of the more resistant pathogens and provide a potent alternative under select circumstances. Conversely, the fl uoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofl oxacin or levofl oxacin) provide broad Gram-negative activity and are easy to use, but their popularity has resulted in rapidly declining levels of activity against many major pathogens, moderating their utility. Aztreonam offers an alternative in the settings of beta-lactam allergy or intolerance of aminoglycosides.",

These drugs are used in combination with agents with Gram-negative and -positive activity, such as cephalosporins or fl uoroquinolones.

Voriconazole provides activity against some of these more resistant species, as well as potent activity against Aspergillus species.

The echinocandins boast essentially none of the renal toxicity of amphotericin and few drug interactions while having activity against numerous other fungi.
