Three days before hospital admission, she developed a high fever (40 \u00b0C), sputum, and nasal discharge. One day before admission, she again visited the clinic and was diagnosed with pneumonia and prescribed levofloxacin (200 mg/day, two times daily).",

Arterial blood gases were as follows: pH 7.452, HCO3 21.6 mmol/l, pCO2 31.6 mmHg, pO2 82.8 mmHg, and base excess \u22121.3 mmol/l. Thoracic CT revealed the crazy-paving sign of right lung field (Fig. 1\n) and ground-glass opacities in the right lower lung field. Gram and acid-fast stains of the sputum were negative. She received ceftriaxone and clarithromycin. The symptoms and infiltration shadow promptly disappeared. Culture of the sputum yielded no bacterial, fungal, or acid-fast bacillus growth. Serologic tests for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumoniae were negative. The patient was discharged after 9 days of hospitalization. We retrospectively analyzed the anti-PIV (types 1\u20133), influenza virus (type A, B), adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus antibody titers and found a greater than 4-fold increase in the anti-PIV type 1 antibodies between the sera obtained on admission and that obtained 2 weeks after the admission (Table 1\n).",

PIV infection is the one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT),8, 9 although PIV pneumonia is very rare in healthy adults. Early, accurate diagnosis of pulmonary complications following HSCT is important because of its high mortality and morbidity. High-resolution CT is important for early diagnosis of pulmonary disease following HSCT.5 Several CT findings of PIV pneumonia have been described in patients following HSCT. Patricia et al. reported the CT findings in 6 HSCT patients with PIV pneumonia who had multiple small nodules without cavitation with a peribronchial distribution.8 There are no previous reports, however, of CT findings of PIV pneumonia in non-immunocompromised host. This is the first report of CT findings of parainfluenza pneumonia in a non-immunocompromised hosts.",

The appearance can also be caused by an airspace disease, where the appearance is due to a linear deposition of material within the airspace.1, 3 In a CT-pathologic correlation of adenovirus pneumonia in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a crazy-paving sign observed on HRCT corresponded histopathologically to an area of diffuse alveolar damage with mixed exudative and proliferative phases.4 The crazy-paving sign on CT in viral pneumonia has been reported in immunocompromised hosts.
