However, based on our analysis of a larger dataset available so far, we find there is no observable difference between the incubation time for SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), highlighting the need for larger and well-annotated datasets. Although phylogenetic analysis indicate it belongs to the same \u03b2-coronavirus genus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 has a higher genome-sequence similarity to several \u03b2-coronaviruses detected in bats. It shows more than 96% identity to a known bat coronavirus, compared to 79.5% identity to SARS-CoV BJ01. 1, 2 Studies investigating the clinical characteristics, epidemic and treatment have also been carried out. According to clinical investigation of the pneumonia cases in China, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes SARS with major symptoms such as fever, cough, myalgia, or fatigue and minor symptoms such as sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea. 3 As more data become available, additional case features are also being revealed. More than half of the initial cases had visited the Wuhan Huanan seafood market. It is also apparent that the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is enormously destructive, despite a mortality rate less than 3% (according to the latest data on February 8th, 2020 in China 4 ) when compared with SARS-CoV (mortality rate 9.6%) and MERS-CoV (mortality rate 9.6% and 34%). 5 However, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection is much broader than SARS or MERS-CoV and involves larger numbers of patients.",

The reported estimate of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation time was based on limited case data. A subsequent unpublished study from 88 cases estimated a mean incubation time of 6.4 days (95% CI, 5.6-7.7 days). 9 However, the data were taken from an online resource, 10 and only a subset of these data (25 patients) had both clearly defined start and stop dates for exposure, together with a date for onset of symptoms.

As of February 8th, 2020, this comprised 50 patients (Supporting Information Material). We also collected additional raw data from earlier reports on SARS (153 patients) and MERS (70 patients) outbreaks (Supporting Information Material). We then fitted \"Weibull\", \"lognormal,\" and \"gamma\" functions to the respective datasets. These are shown for SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and MERS datasets in Figure 1A -C, respectively. The corresponding mean and 95% Table S1 for raw data and references datasets. These are summarized as boxplots in Figure 1D and have notably varying distributions. For the MERS datasets, for example, we found only five reports published with accessible raw data, but one report had several patients with incubation times ranged from 0 to 21 days. It is unclear whether these data were included in the other datasets. If these data are included in the analysis, it significantly impacts the outcome for estimation of incubation times 7.5 (7.1-7.9) days ( Figure S1) Thus, access to well-annotated data related to these topics from clinical patients and subclinical subjects will help our understanding for each of these factors. Our results indicate that the current 14 days isolation period should be continued until more comprehensive data are available. To this end, we make the following suggestions:",
