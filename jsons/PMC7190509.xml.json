In recent decades, most countries advanced in nominal Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPPC), but not in all health indicators (Braveman et al., 2005, Banerjee, 2013). Some health indicators, such as child mortality or malnutrition, seem to have a well-defined declining trend as countries and individuals turn wealthier (Burkitt, 1973, Fedorov and Sahn, 2005, Fogel, 2004; Chen, Lei, & Zhou, 2017). However, others, such as cardiovascular and various non-communicable diseases, do not follow clear patterns of change with economic development.",

            "text": "The blood pressure is defined in technical terms as a result of cardiac output versus peripheral vascular resistance, but its composition depends on certain risk factors; some of which have relations with economic development and demographic features. The intrinsic factors are the genetic predisposition, age, gender and race (Colhoun et al., 1998). The extrinsic factors that affects it negatively are the lack of exercise, poor diet, obesity, excess salt, alcohol abuse, smoking and stress (Colhoun et al., 1998, Braveman et al., 2005, Conen et al., 2009), which are also related to socioeconomic status (Kim et al., 2008). In poor countries with an increase in income, there is a tendency to consume goods and services not previously available widely such as more carbohydrates, red meat, industrialized food, alcoholic beverages, and cigarettes (Burkitt, 1973). There is a higher consumption of kilocalories per capita per day as one has more income available for food consumption or has access to novel food products (Dragone & Ziebarth, 2017); people eat more but not necessarily better. Healthy foods (e.g., non-transfats, reduced saturated fat and healthy oils) are generally more expensive and not commonly available for low-income people (Fogel, 2004, Danaei et al., 2013, Banerjee, 2013, Chow et al., 2013, Ortega et al., 2013). Poor countries and poorer income groups also have less access to good health services, which may affect the access to preventive measure to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. On the other hand, the poor also has a low use of individual motorized modes of transport, and large part of the population uses non-motorized modes (e.g. walking or cycling) (Gwilliam, 2003, Ahmad and Puppim de Oliveira, 2016), which may provide some regular physical activity. As countries and certain groups of the population become richer, they have more resources to invest in health services, but their diets and life styles also change, not always in a healthier direction. For example, as India develops, richer households have higher chances to present individuals with high blood pressure and cardiac conditions (Barik, Desai, & Vanneman, 2018). Thus, economic development can both contribute to minimize certain cardiac risk factors and exacerbate others.",

Abnormal SBP can be a serious concern for a person or society as it is a risk factor for cardiovascular and kidney diseases (Danaei et al., 2014), with consequences not only for the population\u2019s health conditions and longevity but for public and private expenditure in health care (Lee and Kim, 2008, Danaei et al., 2013, Vallejo-Torres and Morris, 2013, Woolf et al., 2015). Moreover, cardiovascular conditions can increase the risk of a person in epidemic outbreaks. For example, people with cardiovascular disease are at a higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 disease (WHO, 2020). Cardiovascular diseases have also a huge impact on productivity and the economy (Leal, Luengo-Fern\u00e1ndez, Gray, Petersen, & Rayner, 2006), which can economically justify certain measures to subsidize health care. Thus, economic growth and health present a two-way relationship. Sustained economic growth can lead to more investment in health, and consequently better health conditions. On the other hand, improved health of the population positively impacts labor productivity and human capital formation (Atun & Gurol-Urganci, 2005).",

            "text": "However, we ask the following broad question, which is not consistently answered by the literature: is there any recognizable shape in the trends relating blood pressure and countries\u2019 income? Several studies identify certain trends in the risk factors as societies develop but they are not conclusive on the relation between GDPPC and blood pressure. For example, one study pointed that national income had a positive correlation with SBP among other risk factors in 1980 but the slope of this association became negative for women in 2008 (Danaei et al., 2013). Mean blood pressure seems to have significantly dropped in high-income western countries between 1975 and 2015, but it rose in other parts of the world, particularly in developing countries, such as many in sub-Saharan Africa (NCD, 2017). Other research outcomes identify trends in cardiac conditions among different social groups or races in a certain country (Barik et al., 2018). There are also studies that provide insights at the micro perspective, looking at the relation between SBP and education, access to health services and professional categories (Conen et al., 2009). They are important to identify how different contexts and development factors affect blood pressure, but there is no study that provides a consistent macro perspective trend between an economic development indicator and blood pressure. This relation is relevant to justify investments in health at the early stages of development in order to avoid cardiac problems in the future and their consequences on human development. In this regard, a crucial point for understanding how to improve public health in the development process is what an increase in income of countries means for the general health of their populations, particularly blood pressure (SBP) in this research. Thus the contribution of this paper is to identify a general relationship between economic development and blood pressure, as the existing studies are not conclusive.",

            "text": "The concept of the Kuznets Curve seems relevant to be tested in this context, as some studies already point rise and fall of blood pressure with different national incomes (Danaei et al., 2013, Danaei et al., 2014, NCD, 2017). Simon Kuznets developed a breakthrough work on the relations between economic development and socio-economic indicators. Using empirical data, he was the first to describe the relationship between inequality and income, known as the \u2018Kuznets Curve\u2019 (Kuznets, 1955, Kuznets, 1976). Later on, though the original curve has been contested (Atkinson & Brandolini, 2010), similar curves were noticed when plotting economic development and different forms of environmental degradation, such as air pollution or deforestation, defining what is called the \u2018Environmental Kuznets Curve\u2019 (Grossman and Krueger, 1994, Stern et al., 1996, Bhattarai and Hammig, 2001, Baland et al., 2010). Kuznets curves have been determined for child labor (Kambhampati & Rajan, 2006) and tested for material use and carbon intensity (Pothen and Welsch, 2019, Roberts and Grimes, 1997). Moreover, empirically, per capita income can be associated with different environmental and socio-economic indicators, which in turn are related to health (Gangadharan and Valenzuela, 2001, Soares, 2004). Kuznets-like curves have been identified for certain health parameters such as injuries and life expectancy (Bishai et al., 2006, Clark, 2011), and obesity (Grecu & Rotthoff, 2015). Concentration indices as a measure of health inequalities have also been observed to show a Kuznets\u2019 curve behavior (Costa-Font, Hernandez-Quevedo, & Sato, 2018). Thus, we decided to check whether the relation between blood pressure and GDPPC follow a trend like a \u201cHeart Kuznets Curve\u201d. If it follows, what would be the measures to tunnel through the curve and avoid the heart effects of economic development? For answering those questions, we evaluated the relationship between per capita GDP (GDPPC) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) of men\u2019s populations, as an indicator of health.",

We used nominal GDP instead of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) as the estimations of the former seems less controversial for long periods (Taylor & Taylor, 2004). Thus, the inflation, but not the differences in the cost of living between countries, has been taken into account (The World Bank, 2018). In order to categorize countries, we used the GDPPC average of four years, namely 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. The country income categories were defined as: (a) low income countries: GDPPC < US$ 1,000; (b) lower-mid: GDPPC ranging from US$ 1,000 to US$ 4,000; (c) upper-mid: GDPPC ranging from US$ 4,001 to US$ 12,000; (d) high: GDPPC > US$ 12,000 (The World Bank, 2018). We discarded countries with missing data and kept only countries with a minimum number of 27 consecutive observations of both variables, which resulted in a dataset of 136 countries (see the list of countries by categories of GDPPC in Table 1 in Annex I). We utilized R (v3.6.2) and Python (v3.7) languages as the tools for data formatting, transformations, visualization, statistical analysis by Pearson\u2019s correlation (r) and regression analysis. Built-in regression functions in R were utilized. In addition, we relied on open-source libraries: pandas (McKinney, 2010), ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) and seaborn (Waskom, 2018).",

In this case the following limitations can be identified with their justifications: (i) Other risk factors could have been utilized. However, measurements of SBP represents one of the easiest, most inexpensive and widespread exams, when compared to other cardiovascular risk factors that require blood tests (e.g., diabetes). This allowed us to analyze longer time series for a large number of countries. (ii) a descriptive statistic approach is used instead of multiple regression analyses (with multiple explaining factors), since it provides a simpler, clear and visual evidence of our findings. A faceted approach, by GPPPC-based country segmentation was used to achieve the outcome objectives. (iii) restriction to male population in the sample. Men are more prone to hypertension than women in similar ages and, when affected by this condition present a greater blood pressure load on the organs (Eison et al., 1990, Reckelhoff, 2001). Thus, we decided to take male SBP as the population risk factor since it is a more stringent scenario. Nevertheless, these questions should be further investigated in longitudinal population-based analyses in future studies.",

The calculated coefficient per country denotes the SBP increase in mmHg for each additional US dollar in GDPPC. Fig. 3B shows the histogram of the regression coefficient for the GDPPC groups as defined above. Fig. 3B indicates that lower GDPPC countries showed a sharper increase in SBP per dollar of increase in GDPPC, when compared to higher income countries. In poorer countries, the mmHg increase is even steeper. Countries that had very low income (GDPPC below US$500 in 1980) such as Mozambique, Uganda and Sudan experienced a steeper increase in SBP, around 5 mmHg during the analyzed period. For example, Ethiopia had a coefficient of around 0.05 mmHg/US$, so for each additional US$1 dollar in GDPPC, the SBP increased 0.05 mmHg. On average, for US$100 increase in GDPPC, a 5 mmHg rise in SBP is observed. In contrast, for the same GDPPC increase, a gentler rise was observed for countries with slightly higher GDPPC, such as Egypt and Fiji, where the SBP increased less than 2mmHg throughout the entire time series. For example, Nicaragua showed a coefficient of around 0.008 mmHg/US$, thus on average equivalent to a 0.8 mmHg for every US$100 increase in GDPPC.",

Most of the countries stayed in the same GDPPC group or crossed to the next adjacent group. The increase of SBP in South Korea was observed in the initial years of our series, with a turning point of GDPPC around US$10,000. As the GDPPC continued to increase over this point, we observed an SBP decrease in the latter years of the series. Even though South Korea's overall Pearson\u2019s r is neutral (r = 0.109), this breakdown into two different moments of the country matches earlier observations of the differences by income and reinforces the existence of the correlation and the idea of the \u2018Heart Kuznets Curve\u2019. South Korea was able to consistently provide a better income and improve their socioeconomic status and at the same time reduce SBP after certain income to reverse the rising SBP trend.",

Thus, though increase in countries\u2019 income tends to provide more access to health services, as countries invest more in health systems and individuals have more income to invest in health care, this may not compensate the negative changes in SBP until a country reaches a certain income per capita, as good quality public health care for the majority of the population takes time to be properly built and may not be a priority for policymakers at early economic development stage (Makhoul, 1984). At a certain income, it is noticed an inflection point in the SBP trend (in South Korea at around US$ 10,000 of GDPPC). The health system and health education improves to make access to health services (e.g., regular blood pressure checks and advice from a cardiologist or nutritionist) and preventive care (e.g., education for awareness about the importance of a more balanced diet) sufficiently more common for the population to a point to revert the rising trend in SBP (Danaei et al., 2013, NCD, 2017).",

            "text": "Another important determinant of SBP is physical activity, which has also some relations with economic development. Regular physical activity is associated with a substantial reduction in cardiovascular disease risks, even in groups with high risks (Humphreys, McLeod, & Ruseski, 2014). In rapid developing economies, urbanization (especially improved housing and transport infrastructure) and industrialization leads to profound shifts not only in how people eat, but how they move, work and exercise (Chow et al., 2013; Danaei et al., 2013). People tend to move from agricultural jobs, which tend to require more physical activities, to work in offices, shops or industrial plants. As individuals get richer, they also tend to move from non-motorized (e.g., walk or bicycle) to use more motorized transportation (Gwilliam, 2003, Ahmad and Puppim de Oliveira, 2016). Thus, lack of physical activities among the population seems to become more common as a country's income rises. As the prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle increases, the risk of heart problems increases. For instance, an isolated risk factor, such as obesity per se, is not the only or the most important factor to determine health. The overweight and active people can be healthier than skinny and sedentary people. The metabolically healthy overweight and well-educated people may not suffer from conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure (De Backer and De Bacquer, 2004, Ortega et al., 2013). Obesity has also socio-economic causes, such as income and education, and has significant economic impacts (Cawley, 2015). Social programs, such as cash transfers, and work activity have ambiguous effects on weight (Levasseur, 2019, Feng et al., 2020). Health specialists suggest the implementation of recommendations regarding diet and physical activity should be a top priority for all (De Backer and De Bacquer, 2004, Chow et al., 2013, Danaei et al., 2013), including economic incentives such as taxes on unhealthy food and drinks (Cawley, 2015). As income rises over certain point, health advice and education tend to improve and make people more aware of the importance of physical activity and diet, contributing to reduce SBP (Braveman et al., 2005; Danaei et al., 2013). Thus, increase in income alone is not translated into wellness automatically. It may worsen the risk factors for cardiovascular disease, if health education and access to health care does not come together with the higher incomes. Maybe the effective access to these services happen just after a certain income turning point.",

Besides aggregate income, income inequality is also correlated to health outcomes and inequity in health service access (Clark, 2011, Kim et al., 2008, Baland et al., 2010, Vallejo-Torres and Morris, 2013). Reducing inequalities can widen the access to quality health services. Moreover, health information and education can transform one's behavior (Colhoun et al., 1998, Conen et al., 2009, Brunello et al., 2016), as education is an important socioeconomic factor determinant of blood pressure progression and a powerful and independent predictor (Braveman et al., 2005, Conen et al., 2009), though not stronger than GDPPC (see Annex IV). A better income should also come with improvement in health education to reduce health risks (Conen et al., 2009, J\u00fcrges et al., 2013, Woolf et al., 2015, Lundborg et al., 2016). For example, higher income individuals reduce more the intake of fat than poorer one when receiving hypertension diagnosis (Zhao, Konishi, & Glewwe, 2013). Other factors, such as mother\u2019s education, are key for improving nutrition in their children (Behrman, Deolalikar, & Wolfe, 1988).",

As large part of the world population is poor or has low income (Pew Research Center, 2015), in order to improve global health inequities, policy makers, including those in governments and international organizations, should develop new approaches to control these major risks for cardiovascular diseases in poorer countries in a more effective manner (Friedrich, 2014). In general, investments in health tend to address the need of the ruling privileged elites and not the wider population (Makhoul, 1984, Mobarak et al., 2011), which are also more vulnerable to economic crises in terms of health (Pradhan et al., 2007, Shkolnikov et al., 1998). Health problems can have a significant impact on the wealth of elders (Lee & Kim, 2008). Public programs that improve access to health services can reduce health inequalities and have significant impact on the most vulnerable (Van de gaer, 2013, Bagnoli, 2019). In turn, healthier societies can be more productive. Poor children with more access to public health care improve their attendance and scores (Alcaraz, Chiquiar, Orraca, & Salcedo, 2016). There are opportunities through the understanding that there is a \u2018Heart Kuznets Curve\u2019 for designing a better investment strategy in health care and health education that can lead to better lifestyles and reduce the risks of high SBP at early stages of development, improving the general health of the population and saving large amounts of resources in the later stages of economic development. Young adults with good cardiovascular health result in lower future costs in health care (Schiman et al., 2019). Public policies can help, informing and providing the knowledge and infrastructure to change habits (e.g., areas to exercise, opportunities for activity using non-motorized transportation). Investments in health education and services to avoid cardiovascular diseases in early stages of development can also mitigate the climbing costs of the health systems.",

Despite the strong correlation in some countries, we understand that within the same country there are various population groups with different socio-economic status. Countries also have distinct age distribution and ethnicities. It could be revealing to perform a deeper analysis into micro regions to better understand the behavior of individuals and groups and its relation to systemic blood pressure in different socio-political and cultural contexts. Moreover, the relations between changes in income, changes in other socioeconomic factors and cardiovascular risk factors should be empirically tested through further quantitative and qualitative studies with multiple independent variables. We tested the correlation between education (mean years of schooling) and SBP, and though these two variables are correlated, the correlation between GDPPC and SBP is stronger (Annex IV, Fig. 8). Nevertheless, education and other factors, such as investments in health infrastructure, have an important impact on SBP, and future research could identify macro trends in those factors. A myriad of other variables, including mental and psychological factors, such as stress caused by economic instability, working conditions or vulnerability to natural disasters, also have influence in cardiac conditions, as pointed by some studies (Katsouyanni et al., 1986, Kivim\u00e4ki et al., 2006). In developing countries, other factors, such as socio-economic vulnerability or poor urban conditions, which could increase stress, could be further investigated to identify any trends (Suchday, Kapur, Ewart, & Friedberg, 2006). Thus, we suggest further studies involving several independent variables, such as using multiple regressions, for future research, as the objective of this study was limited to the macro trends in the relation between two variables (income per capita and blood pressure). Finally, studies using other proxies of economic development and blood pressure could be carried out to check the robustness of the trends we identified in this study.",
