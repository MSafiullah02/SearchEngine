The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [2], [3]. As of 16 April 2020, more than 2 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 213 countries and territories [1]. Liver transplantation (LTX) is the second most common solid organ transplantation worldwide after kidney transplantation. The overall global LTX rate is 3.7 per million population \ufeff\n[4], [5]. Indications of LTX also vary according to geography. In developed countries, HCV has been the main indication for LTX, although it is now being replaced by alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while in Asia; hepatitis B and HCC remain a common indication for LTX [6], [7]. In Arab countries, 3,804 liver transplants were performed in the period 1990-2013 in which Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) represented 80%, and deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) represented 20%. Fifty-six percent of the reported cases were in Egypt [8].",

            "text": "Based on previous observations for SARS and other related viruses, a theoretical risk of liver damage exists with COVID-19 infection [9], [10]. However, available data only reported hepatic dysfunction in the form of abnormal levels of liver aminotransferases and slightly elevated bilirubin levels, mainly in critically ill patients [11]. On the other hand, reports during an influenza outbreak in Germany in winter 2017/2018 showed increased organ failure scores of patients with liver cirrhosis where 5 out of 11 patients with liver cirrhosis developed acute liver failure during influenza infection [12]. No data available on the impact of COVID-19 on decompensated liver disease patients awaiting LTX, but because of the known immunocompromised state of these patients, adequate protective measures should be maintained. Although healthcare facilities are overwhelmed with management of COVID-19 patients & health resources are being rapidly consumed, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), recommended against postponing transplantation. Moreover, they advised each program to consider its capability regarding intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators availability, and blood donation [10]. Prioritization of transplant candidates is another problem that may face clinicians due to limited resources during the pandemic, as well as the exclusion of donors infected with COVID-19 [10]. Immunosuppression in the post-transplant recipients may be protective against cytokine storm induced by COVID-19, which is responsible for the severe illness on the one hand. However, and on the other hand, recipients on immunosuppression may have more intense and prolonged shedding of the virus, increasing the risk of transmission to contacts, including healthcare workers [13]. This could emphasize the crucial role of implementing infection control measures to avoid losing candidates on the LTX waiting list because of the closed transplantation centers [14].",

            "text": "International societies like World Health Organization (WHO) and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are always confirming the necessity to use Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) in addition to the restriction of outpatient and elective procedures as preventive measures against COVID-19 [15]. Limitations of aerosol-generating procedures like suction, endotracheal intubation, and advanced endoscopy are of major concern due to the fear of the possibility of disease transmission. Further restrictions to prevent other routes of infections like feco-oral transmission, included colorectal surgeries and colonoscopies. Currently, many interventional surgical societies, anesthesia, endoscopy, radiology, and intensive care have placed their statements, guidelines, and recommendations to adjust their practice to the current epidemic [16]. Different reasons rationalized the delay or even cancellation of non-emergency procedures as they would consume PPE tools which are currently running short supply worldwide. The second reason that such elective procedures are postponed or canceled is to prevent unnecessary infections to medical staff and caregivers, which may be transmitted from asymptomatic COVID-19 patients or their companions. Also, they consider such procedures a further burden and workload on an already exhausted medical system. Finally, occupying the operative theatres with such cases would warranty the need for mechanical ventilators that might be more beneficial and valuable if they are directed to rescue a COVID-19 patient\u2019s life [17]. Meticulous evaluation should be done before deciding for the priority of the procedure through detailed history taking, one by one consultation, temperature measurement, hand hygiene, and reporting of any suspected case of COVID-19 (even if afebrile), and finally cleaning and disinfection protocols of premises. Repeated physical examination and temperature measurement along with the revision of chest imaging like a computed tomography scan or a chest radiograph, and if COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed, all non-emergency procedures would be delayed or canceled [18].",

Bearing in mind that any liver transplant related activity not only involves the donor and the recipient, but it involves many individuals, including doctors, paramedical staff, nurses, and health care workers. Taking into consideration that there is a risk of the donor to recipient transmission of COVID-19, from both deceased donors and living donors. The risk of donor-derived infection would depend upon donor exposure, infectivity in the incubation period, degree and duration of viremia, and viability of the virus within blood or specific organ compartments [13]. Traditionally, The AASLD/AST guidelines outline four major types of indications for LTX in the United States: Acute liver failure, complicated cirrhosis, metabolic liver diseases, and systemic complications of chronic liver disease [19]. Acute liver failure is the most important indication for emergency LTX. Common causes of acute liver failure include acetaminophen overdose, acute viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, mushroom poisoning, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, acute ischemic hepatitis (shock liver), and acute fatty liver of pregnancy [19], [20], [21], [22]. Similarly, patients with cirrhosis and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome have a median survival of fewer than two weeks and should be urgently referred to a transplant center for expedited transplant evaluation, as should patients with other evidence for rapid hepatic decompensation [19], [23].",

            "text": "Two types of LTX techniques are available; the first is the conventional or standard method, which involves implantation of whole liver grafts DDLT, and this type is the most widely used in the USA and Europe [19]. The other type is LDLT, and this is the only option available for patients living in some countries like Egypt as cadaveric organ transplant is still banned there, and that is why some patients travel abroad seeking organ transplant elsewhere [35]. At present, the organ procurement organizations (OPOs) and hospitals having LDLT programs should screen potential donors for exposure and clinical symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and as more information builds up, the ideal approach would hopefully be developed [36]. Although personal contact is the basis of the doctor-patient relationship, which allows rapid and accurate assessment of the patient's condition, unfortunately, it exposes physicians to the risk of infection and becomes a source of the virus spread. Therefore, it is considered wise to substitute direct contact with patients with more distant interactions with the utilization of available technology. The same approach could also be applied to the post-operative period for the donor in the case of LDLT, aiming to be discharged as soon as possible from the hospital [37]. With the increasing number of infected cases and mortality caused by COVID-19, a recent discussion for using organs from patients infected with COVID-19 has led to several points of debate. For instance, from the clinical point of view, it could potentially be a life-saving procedure, especially that delays might result in more deterioration for the patient's need for the organ and even increase the risk of COVID-19 exposure. on the other hand, it may transmit infection, which would even be more severe in transplant recipients, especially in the absence of effective therapy. Financially speaking, it can be a possible source of income for hospitals despite reimbursements remain uncertain. It might be argued from the legal point that organs with HCV have already been transplanted after getting informed consent from patients. Nevertheless, this disease has a different risk profile compared to HCV. As regards the ethical perspective, this procedure respects the wishes of donors and their families and ensures the autonomy of patients willing to do so. However, patients could be overwhelmed with responsibility for informed consent in the presence of little guidance [38].",

These effects are not only confined to donor or recipient issues but also extends to involve many other problems in the availability of healthcare resources [13]. We are faced with enormous challenges owing to the high communicability and virulence of the virus, the risk of introducing immunosuppressive therapies during this pandemic, and our utmost need for all the health care utilities. On the other hand, we do have a very long list of miserable patients waiting for LTX, which is the only available treatment option for this difficult to treat a group of patients, so judicious decisions and strict precautions became now mandatory [40]. Streptococcal pneumonia and influenza vaccines are strongly recommended to all recipients prior to LTX, together with strict prophylaxis against complications of cirrhosis to reduce the number of hospital admissions [41]. It is also recommended to test for COVID-19 in patients with acute decompensation or Acute on top of chronic liver failure (ACLF) [39]. For those on LTX lists, it is recommended to test both donors and recipients for COVID-19 before LTX, putting into consideration that negative results do not totally exclude the infection. Alternatively, computed tomography (CT) of the chest can be considered [42]. Pre-procedure consent should include the potential hazard for the acquisition of nosocomial COVID-19infection [39]. Accepting only grafts with a low risk of delayed graft function to reduce complications and minimize the length of postoperative stay is also recommended [10]. Diminishing exposure of health care workers as much as possible, through using online clinics and phone calls as a substitute to primary clinics can prevent unnecessary risk of infection. Doctors may also talk to all patients by phone before their visits to rule out any possibility of COVID-19 infection. Deferring optional visits and restricting it only to urgent ones also help to prevent nosocomial infections [37]. Modifications of the outpatient transplant clinics by widening the patients\u2019 waiting areas and following strict infection control precautions is of utmost importance [43].",

Hospital admission of liver transplant recipients should be considered only for patients suffering from major complications like rejection, decompensation, or vascular complications. During in-person outpatient follow up visits, liver transplant recipients should be evaluating in dedicated hepatology/liver transplant clinics away from clinics where confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 are evaluated [10]. Once the patient is clinically stable, it is recommended to perform his routine laboratory investigations, including drug levels at primary care facilities [39]. Telemedicine can mitigate exposure of both patients and healthcare workers to COVID-19 as it allows better physician-patient communication. Development of COVID-19 symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, diarrhea, the new loss of sense of taste or smell, contact with known COVID-19 patients, history of recent travel) in a liver transplant recipient should prompt urgent referral for evaluation along with hepatic symptomatology surveillance and drug compliance assurance [37], [46].",

As an example, the SARS outbreak in Toronto led to closures of 35 ICU beds for ten days, which represented 38 % of the tertiary-care university medical-surgical beds of ICU in Toronto [47]. Many reasons represent a challenge in caring for patients with COVID-19 with a high risk of exposure for ICU staff. COVID-19 is highly contagious, along with more than one route of transmission.The high exposure dose, long contact hours with cases, some procedures such as noninvasive ventilation, and the length of ICU stay are representing the challenges for ICU staff during the epidemic [48]. So, special measures and precautions should be taken in intensive care. For example, cases with COVID-19 should be admitted to single bedded and negative pressure rooms in separate units within intensive care. Clinical engineering should have rapid and special plans to convert standard rooms into ICU rooms. Retrofitting the rooms with externally exhausted HEPA filters may solve the problem [49]. Most of the transplanted patients have multiple comorbidities and organ dysfunction, demanding high appropriate critical care management to support prompt graft recovery and prevent systemic complications [50]. The early postoperative period is a critical time. Strict monitoring of vital data, support of cardiorespiratory performance, early assessment of graft function, along with recognition of unexpected complications (medical and surgical) are mandatory. The Intensive care management of liver transplanted patients mainly focuses on rapid hemodynamic stabilization, early weaning from mechanical ventilation, coagulopathy correction, preservation of kidney function, graft rejection prevention, proper fluid administration, and infection prophylaxis [50].",

A recent protocol applied in one of the major centers of LTX in Portugal is to test new liver transplant cases with PCR for COVID-19 and arrange for transfer other medical or surgical critically-ill patients to the nearest other ICUs inside the hospital or outside, to ensure the ICU beds availability for new liver transplant cases. Moreover, patients and staff from each sector of the ICU should use different routes inside the ICU to decrease the risk of infection [51]. Another way to minimize the possibility of ICU admissions is by applying the fast track protocols which can be applied safely for selected patients undergoing either living or DDLT [52]. The definition of fast-tracking in liver transplant still lacks consensus among different centers, ranging from early postoperative extubating in the operating room once the surgery is finished, to strategies that minimize postoperative ventilation time.Generally, this term is reserved for early extubation, recovery in a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), and direct transfer to the surgical ward avoiding an ICU stay [53], [54].",

As the innate immune response associated with increased serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) levels may be the main driver for pulmonary injury due to COVID-19, immunosuppression may be protective [33], [60]. Coronaviruses have not shown to cause more severe disease in immunosuppressed patients. More interestingly, reviewing the mortality and morbidity reports published on Coronaviruses outbreaks such SARS that emerged in 2002, MERS, and more recently COVID-19, no fatalities were reported in patients undergoing transplantations, receiving chemotherapies or other immunosuppressive treatments [61]. Risk factors for poor outcome include older age (post-transplant recipients aged >60 years old) male sex and presence of comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease) [10]. Available data on coronavirus before and during outbreaks suggest that immunosuppressed patients are not at increased risk of severe pulmonary disease compared to the general population; however, immunosuppression may prolong viral shedding in post-transplant patients with COVID-19 if they are already infected [36], [60]. Immunosuppressive therapy should be started in patients with liver disease with or without COVID-19 who have strong indications for treatment (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis, liver transplant patients, and in cases of graft rejection). This should be done without compromising their transplant management as reducing the dosage or stopping immunosuppressants as this may precipitate acute rejection in a liver transplant recipient, so there is no need to reduce or stop immunosuppression for asymptomatic post-transplant patients without known COVID-19 [10]. The reduction should only be considered under special circumstances (e.g., medication-induced lymphopenia, or bacterial/fungal superinfection in case of severe COVID-19) after consultation of a specialist [62]. The potential role of corticosteroids for the prevention of progression of mild COVID-19 to severe pneumonia is unknown. WHO recommends avoiding corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 unless indicated for another therapeutic purpose [63]. In patients with confirmed COVID-19, we should minimize the dosage of prednisone, maintaining a sufficient dosage to avoid adrenal insufficiency [39]. Similarly, it is also advised to reduce daily calcineurin inhibitor dosage; consider decreasing tacrolimus/cyclosporine by 50%, stop mycophenolate (CellCept/Myfortic) and Azathioprine especially in the setting of lymphopenia, fever, or worsening pneumonia attributed to COVID-19. In the case of ground-glass opacities, pneumonia switching mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to calcineurin inhibitors (CNI, e.g., tacrolimus) should be done given the possibility of pneumonitis with mTor; otherwise, we should stop all immunosuppression [59]. For outpatients on belatacept, switching to tacrolimus or cyclosporine should be considered after 28 days from the last dose, to avoid clinic visit. For inpatients on belatacept, we should not administer any further belatacept. Twenty-eight days after the last dose, adding low dose CNI should be considered. For CNI intolerant patients, increasing daily prednisone dose from 5 mg to 7.5-10 mg daily might be considered. Low dose prednisone (5 mg) in all patients who were receiving it before hospitalization can be maintained [59].",
