In experimentally infected individuals, the virus caused a febrile illness with mild upper respiratory symptoms [7] , similar to most described cases of naturally acquired infections [8] , and is thought to be less severe than other influenza types.

There was also a lower rate of detection in those aged <6 months, corresponding to a time when children have residual maternal antibodies that could provide some immunological protection [32] . The lowest rates of detection occurred among teenagers, with slightly higher rates in adults, though this was not statistically significant.

Alternatively, it may be possible to have serial infections with antigenically distinct circulating lineages. The presence of at least 6 influenza C lineages raises the question of whether exposure to new strains might allow infection of previously exposed individuals.

First, clinical testing was done at the discretion of the treating clinician. Thus, some patients may not have had testing ordered or had a residual specimen for testing at MDH, leading to an underestimation of cases. A second caveat is that children, particularly those aged <1 year, are more likely to be hospitalized for respiratory infections and therefore have respiratory specimens obtained for testing [36] . This is reflected in the fact that 57% of patients from the SARI surveillance program were aged <5 years. Third, no information was obtained about underlying medical conditions or follow-up data for outpatient cases, and thus, a comparative analysis of comorbidities and outcomes with SARI cases was not possible. Finally, influenza C virus was commonly codetected with other viral pathogens. When compared to culture-based methods, molecular detection methods such as ours frequently detect multiple infections, which poses a challenge to interpretation [37] . Viral nucleic acid may be detectable for prolonged periods of time, including in asymptomatic individuals, and it can be difficult to distinguish among symptomatic infection, asymptomatic shedding, and noninfectious viral debris [37] . Therefore, it will also be important to measure influenza C virus prevalence in asymptomatic controls to address the potential for asymptomatic shedding.
