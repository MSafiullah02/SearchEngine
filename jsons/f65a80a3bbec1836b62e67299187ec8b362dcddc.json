A better understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical for the application and development of therapeutics. The degree to which the innate immune response confers protection or induces pathogenesis through a dysregulated immune response remains unclear. In this review, we discuss what is known about the role of the innate immune system during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggest directions for future studies, and evaluate proposed COVID-19 immunomodulating therapeutics.",

A unique aspect of this study was the ability to compare this severe case to two mild COVID-19 cases, in which proinflammatory cytokines were not markedly elevated. A second study also demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines were not elevated in mild COVID-19 (Thevarajan et al., 2020) . Together, these studies indicate that a heightened proinflammatory response is characteristic of severe COVID-19.

Global functional analyses of differentially expressed genes by Zhou et al. revealed an upregulation in inflammatory pathways, such as \"Chemokine Signaling\" and \"Chemokine signaling pathway\" (Zhou et al., 2020b) . Conversely, Xiong et al. found that upregulated genes were related to viral infection with the most enriched biological processes being \"Co-translational protein targeting to membrane\" and \"Protein targeting to the ER\" . Unlike Xiong et al., Zhuo et al. found significant upregulation of CXCL17, a chemoattractant for immature DCs and monocytes, as well as IL1RN and IL1\u03b2. While the differences between these two studies could be due to the lower sample size used by Xiong et al., both studies found significant upregulation of chemokines likely responsible for neutrophil (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL6) and monocyte (CCL2 and CCL8) recruitment to the lungs Zhou et al., 2020b) . Upregulation of CCL2 and CCL8 was also observed in postmortem lung samples from two COVID-19 patients (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020) . Zhou et al. also investigated expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and found 83 to be significantly upregulated, including those with direct antiviral activity, such as IFITMs. Upregulation of IFIT2 and IFITM3 were confirmed by Blanco-Melo et al. (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020) . With one exception, patients who were sampled later from the date of symptom onset had lower levels of cytokine-related genes and ISGs (Zhou et al., 2020b) .

            "text": "Together, these data present several common themes. The first is that COVID-19 consistently results in the upregulation of chemokines, particularly those that act as chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes. This suggests that influx of these cell types into infected tissues may contribute to tissue damage and increased cytokine production. The second is that high levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, and IL-6 may be a hallmark of more severe disease. The third is that there seems to be a robust ISG signature in the lungs, which supports the idea that SARS-CoV-2 stimulates the IFN response to some degree. Future studies with larger sample sizes and longitudinal sampling are required. It will be critical to determine how the course of the proinflammatory response relates to symptoms and patient outcomes. It would also be important to determine to what extent the potentially moderate IFN response is suppressing viral replication versus contributing to immunopathogenesis.",

This study went on to find that the NLR was the most accurate predictor of progression to severe COVID-19. A significantly higher proportion of activated mast cells and neutrophils as well as a higher NLR was also observed in the BALF of COVID-19 patients (Zhou et al., 2020b) (Figure 2) . Similarly, Wilk et al. observed that COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation had a significant increase in peripheral activated granulocytes compared to unventilated COVID-19 patients and healthy controls (Wilk et al., 2020) . Wilk et al.' s data, along with the fact that chemoattractants for neutrophils are upregulated during COVID-19 (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b) , suggest that granulocytes may significantly contribute to pathogenesis.",

However, this increase in CD14 + monocytes appears to resolve during the late recovery stage of infection . Several groups have reported decreased CD14 + monocyte expression of HLA class II genes (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020; Ong et al., 2020; Wilk et al., 2020) . This decrease suggests that severe COVID-19 patients may be unable to mount a robust T cell response, which could contribute to the observed decrease in T cell levels (Diao et al., 2020; Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020; Ong et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020) . Interestingly, a negative correlation between serum IL-6 levels and the absolute number of HLA-DR molecules on CD14 + monocytes was reported (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020) suggesting IL-6 is associated with the downregulation of HLA-DR.",

            "text": "The role of peripheral monocytes in the proinflammatory response is unclear. Guo et al. identified a unique subpopulation of monocytes present in the severe phase of COVID-19 (Guo et al., 2020) . This severe phase-specific subpopulation expressed high levels of inflammatory genes potentially regulated by the transcription factors ETS2, NFIL3, and PHLDA2. Zhou et al. also found an increase in inflammatory monocytes secreting IL-6 and GM-CSF in COVID-19 patients, particularly patients experiencing severe COVID-19 (Zhou et al., 2020a) (Figure 1 ). Even COVID-19 patients in recovery stages, early or late, were reported to have more CD14 + IL-1\u03b2 + and IFNactivated monocytes compared to healthy controls . In contrast, Wilk et al. found that peripheral monocytes did not significantly upregulate genes for proinflammatory cytokines (Wilk et al., 2020) . There was also significant heterogeneity in ISG upregulation in monocytes, with only some patients upregulating ISGs, but no clear association with disease severity (Wilk et al., 2020) . The inconsistencies between the three single-cell RNAseq (scRNA-seq) studies could be due to the differences in study design. Guo In the lung, Zhou et al. did not observe a significant increase in M0, M1, or M2 macrophages in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (Zhou et al., 2020b) . A different study reported the opposite, finding that severe COVID-19 cases had more macrophages compared to mild cases (Liao et al., 2020) (Figure 2 ). Liao et al. also found that the composition of lung macrophages was dramatically different in severe cases compared to mild cases and healthy controls. Severe cases had an increase in inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages and SPP1 + macrophages with almost no alveolar macrophages. In contrast, the composition of lung macrophages in mild cases and healthy controls was dominated by alveolar macrophages. Interestingly, in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, alveolar macrophages were identified as acting in an immunosuppressive capacity (Zhao et al., 2009) . Overall, Liao et al.'s study suggests that trafficking of peripheral monocytes to the lung and their differentiation into macrophages may enhance the proinflammatory response and the recruitment of other innate immune cells.",

Another study found a decrease in the abundance of resting DCs and an increase in the abundance of activated DCs in the lungs of COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (Zhou et al., 2020b) (Figure 2 ).

One study found that several upregulated genes in PBMCs from COVID-19 patients are involved in the apoptosis and P53 signaling pathways, suggesting lymphopenia may be due to SARS-CoV-2-mediated apoptosis . To date, there have been two studies investigating NK cells in BALF (Figure 2 ). The first performed bulk RNA-seq on BALF from eight COVID-19 cases and found a significant decrease in the estimated abundance of resting NK cells in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls, but no change in the abundance of activated NK cells (Zhou et al., 2020b) . Conversely, scRNA-seq analysis of BALF samples from three severe patients, three mild patients, and eight healthy controls found higher proportions of NK cells in COVID-19 patients suggesting NK cell trafficking to the lungs (Liao et al., 2020) . The discrepancies between these two studies could be explained by the fact that Zhou et al.'s cohort was sampled closer to the day of symptom onset than the cohort used by Liao et al., suggesting that the influx of NK cells into the lungs might only occur during the later stages of infection.",

Given the observed differences in NK cell count between mild and severe COVID-19 cases (Wilk et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020) , it is important that we stratify COVID-19 cases based on severity in future analyses. To clarify the role of NK cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection, the interaction between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and primary NK cells needs to be studied. Do infected cells upregulate ligands for activating NK cell receptors, facilitating targeting by NK cells? Conversely, do infected cells downregulate activating ligands or upregulate inhibitory ligands as a mechanism of NK cell evasion? Addressing these questions will also require HLA and KIR typing of COVID-19 patients to determine if certain haplotypes correlate with disease severity.",

One of these studies found that genotypes associated with low MBL levels were more prevalent in SARS patients (Ip et al., 2005) . However, these results are controversial as another group found no significant difference in MBL genotypes between SARS patients and healthy controls (Yuan et al., 2005) .",

Clinical studies need to evaluate the presence of complement proteins, MBL, and MASP-2 in the serum of COVID-19 patients. If a robust correlation exists between increased disease severity and high concentrations of these proteins, complement-targeted therapies should be considered to mitigate pathogenesis. Additionally, determining whether genotypes associated with low MBL levels are more prevalent in severe COVID-19 patients would be important for identifying at-risk populations.",

            "text": "Based on the evidence that a dysregulated immune response plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, there has been significant excitement about the potential to improve COVID-19 outcomes by using immunomodulators. As of May 12, 2020 Clinicaltrials.gov had 1,409 COVID-related clinical trials. Many immunomodulatory agents are being explored alone and in combination with other drugs. A summary of these agents is provided in Table 1 . At the forefront of this debate are the IL-6 blocking agents Tocilizumab and Sarilumab, with 52 studies of these agents alone. There have been several anecdotal reports of benefit with Tocilizumab, including a study profiling the immune response by RNA-seq (Guo et al., 2020) . However, understanding the usefulness of this and other drugs will require randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials as such anecdotal reports can often be misleading. An important consideration in such trials is the timing of administration, as premature administration could hinder the ability to fight the virus. Current clinical guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America highlight these knowledge gaps and recommend that any unproven immune modulating agent only be used in the contexts of a clinical trial (Bhimraj et al., 2020) .",

But a critical question we must ask ourselves is, what is a 'regulated' response to SARS-CoV-2? The answer may lie with a patient population that up until now, has been relatively understudied. The vast majority of COVID-19 studies have focused on patients requiring hospitalization. A critical part of furthering our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and potentially identifying a 'regulated' immune response, will be to study COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization. What is different about their reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection that allows them to resolve the infection without medical intervention? A longitudinal study comparing the immune responses of hospitalized versus nonhospitalized patients would help provide this important insight. Such studies will provide a necessary guide as to how we need to modulate the immune response for maximum benefit and improved patient outcomes.",

The peripheral innate immune response to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some peripheral CD14 + monocytes have an inflammatory phenotype and secrete T cellactivating cytokines, while others have decreased HLA class II expression, which could result in decreased antigen presentation to naive T cells. Monocytes and activated granulocytes, such as neutrophils, may phagocytose or degranulate in response to opsonized infected cells. Prior to exhaustion, NK cells might kill infected cells via direct killing or ADCC. While a decrease in the abundance of DCs is reported, the behavior of DCs is currently unknown.
