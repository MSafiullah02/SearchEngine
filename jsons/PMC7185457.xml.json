Therefore, antemortem diagnosis can be challenging, and typically involves a combination of tests such as screening for systemic and metastatic diseases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and testing for various infectious diseases that can cause CNS inflammation. Once a presumptive diagnosis has been made, the patient is often placed under the umbrella diagnosis of meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology (MUE), which accounts for the various subtypes of noninfectious inflammatory CNS disorders. Following biopsy or postmortem examination, patients can be further classified. Histopathologically described subtypes include granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME), necrotizing leukoencephalitis (NLE), and necrotizing meningoencephalitis (NME). Steroid responsive meningitis arteritis (SRMA) and eosinophilic meningoencephalitis (EME) are more easily characterized antemortem, and are also suspected to be immune-mediated in origin. Inflammatory disease of the CNS can affect the meninges (meningitis), the brain (encephalitis), the spinal cord (myelitis), or a combination. For the purpose of this review, the term MUE will be employed for all general discussions on immune-mediated CNS inflammation.",

Dogs with a histopathologic diagnosis of GME tended to be older than dogs with the necrotizing forms (4-8 years vs. <4 years, respectively).3 In a retrospective study comparing the imaging findings of neoplastic, vascular, and inflammatory CNS diseases, the median age for patients with inflammatory disease was 5 years, compared with 9 years for neoplasia, and 11 years for vascular disease.6\n",

The concentrations of both GFAP and anti-GFAP antibodies have also been measured in the CSF. CSF anti-GFAP IgG was significantly higher in dogs with NME than dogs with other inflammatory diseases, noninflammatory CNS diseases, and healthy controls. NME dogs also had higher levels of GFAP than dogs with noninflammatory CNS disease and healthy dogs. There was no significant difference between NME and other CNS inflammatory diseases. Healthy Pugs had a higher concentration of GFAP than other healthy dogs and 2 had concentrations similar to the Pugs with NME.

One study performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for herpesvirus, adenovirus, and canine parvovirus on the brains of 7 dogs with histologically confirmed GME and 15 with NME/NLE, and no viral nucleic acids were found in any sample.14 Another study performed PCR on brains of GME and NME cases for adenovirus, bunyavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, flavivirus, herpesvirus, paramyxovirus, and parechovirus, and no viral nucleic acids were detected. The same study also found Mycoplasma species via PCR in 1 dog with GME, 5 with NME, and 1 control. Mycoplasma was also cultured in 4 dogs with GME, 4 with NME, and 2 controls.

Unfortunately, it is difficulty to differentiate dogs with focal meningomyelitis from other causes of myelopathy, such as intervertebral disc disease (IVDD), with exam alone. Meningomyelitis can have varied presentations including acute or chronic duration with varying degrees of paresis and urinary/fecal incontinence, although no dogs were plegic on presentation in this particular study. A variety of both large and small breed dogs were represented in this study as well, with ages ranging from 10 months to 10 years, so this should be considered as a differential for all dogs presenting with focal or multifocal myelopathic signs.21\n",

These lesions occur most commonly in the prosencephalon and have variable degree and characterization of contrast enhancement.

In either disorder, there can be areas of T1W hypointensity, consistent with cystic or necrotic areas.2, 26 It is also of note that most reported imaging findings in regard to NLE are in Yorkshire Terriers, the breed in which this version of encephalitis was first described.

One study compared the MRI findings with the histopathologic changes observed in 55 cases with various CNS diseases including neoplasia, inflammatory, and ischemic disease. This study found vascular proliferation, dilation, and leakage in areas both with and without enhancement and that some necrotic areas were homogeneously contrast enhancing on MRI. Other areas that exhibited ring enhancement on MRI were not correlated to areas of central cavitation and necrosis, as expected. These findings are important, because it is tempting to interpret areas suggestive of necrosis, such as ring enhancing areas, with concern for the more aggressive forms of encephalitis, which may not be the case.27 A case series involving 2 Yorkshire terriers with NLE found that areas with more contrast enhancement correlated with an increased amount of lymphohistiocytic inflammation. These areas tended to be isointense on T1. Hypointense areas on T1 tended to have minimal or no contrast enhancement.27 Contrast enhancement is not likely to provide prognostic information based on these reports.",

In this study, the CSF d-dimer concentrations were unreadable at 6 weeks and the other parameters were significantly lower than at diagnosis.37 IgA has been considered a promising biomarker in the identification and monitoring of SRMA for many years. In 2012, this was re-evaluated and confirmed in a large study of 525 paired canine CSF and serum samples of patients with various CNS and systemic diseases. Significant differences in CSF IgA concentrations were detected when compared with all other disease groups aside from other CNS inflammatory diseases. However, serum IgA concentrations in the SRMA patients were significantly higher than all other categories. The CSF IgA values remained elevated throughout the course of disease (diagnosis, treatment, and relapse), but were highest at diagnosis and relapse. The sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing SRMA by measuring IgA concentration in paired CSF and serum samples are 91% and 78%, respectively.33\n",

Histopathologically, gliosis, gemistocytosis, and perivascular cuffing have been described in these locations. In these 4 cases, cerebral white matter was involved, as well as cerebellar white matter in 3 dogs. Lymphoplasmacytic meningeal infiltration was also described.

Referral for MRI, CSF analysis, and brain biopsy (when indicated) is ideal, but not always practical. When diagnosis of MUE is suspected and referral is declined, diagnostic recommendations include a systemic workup to rule out metabolic or metastatic disease and infectious disease testing. The patient's signalment and neurolocalization are instrumental in prioritizing the differential list. In young to middle-aged small and toy breed dogs (especially Pug dogs, Maltese, and Yorkshire Terriers) with progressive neurologic signs who have an unremarkable systemic workup and negative infectious disease tests, MUE should be strongly considered. Treatment with steroids (1-2 mg/kg per day) should be initiated once a reasonable attempt has been made to exclude infectious diseases. Response to treatment is variable, and prognosis is guarded for most forms of MUE. There is great need for additional prospective studies evaluating response to different immunosuppressive treatment options as well as improved techniques for determining prognostic criteria antemortem.",
