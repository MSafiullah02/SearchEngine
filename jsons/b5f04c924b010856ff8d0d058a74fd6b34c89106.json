With an estimated 130 million people chronically infected, HCV is a major cause of liver disease worldwide and represents a global healthcare concern. Unfortunately, there is no preventative vaccine to protect against HCV infection, and the available IFN-based standard of care therapy (pegylated IFN-\u03b1 plus ribavirin) is costly, poorly tolerated, associated with significant side effects, and only effective in a fraction of chronically infected individuals. Therefore, as with the other pathogens discussed within this chapter, the need to develop new-generation HCV \"antiinfectives\" is a healthcare imperative. Although several small molecules that target HCV replication are in the clinical pipeline, the emergence of viral escape mutants indicates that a combination of anti-HCV drugs targeting multiple aspects of infection will likely be required to successfully treat the majority of patients.

An improvement in the in vitro kinetic parameters of NS3 protease activity was made by Bianchi et al.

Cleavage of the peptide increases the distance between the fluorophores, resulting in proportional 5-FAM fluorescence.

First, while traditional viral HTS assays typically aim to achieve a synchronized single-cycle round of viral replication using a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) approach, this results in biased selection of inhibitors that target viral entry and replication over those compounds that inhibit later viral infection processes such as maturation, egress, and any subsequent cellto-cell spread. To avoid this predisposition and to identify inhibitors of all aspects of the viral life cycle, the HCV HTS assay described herein is based on a low-MOI 6-day infection during which multiple rounds of HCV infection, and spreading of the virus throughout the culture, occur. As such, inhibitors that target any step of the viral life cycle can be successfully identified. Secondly, to accommodate this long, 6-day infection, this HCV HTS assay makes use of nondividing, synchronized hepatoma cell cultures, which allow for highly reproducible, robust HCVcc infection over an extended period of time, virtually eliminating the well-to-well cell culture-related variability that often plagues cell-based HTS strategies. Additionally, these ready-for-use cultures are easily maintained in and have an inherent tolerability to the common compound library diluent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). For the average researcher, it is also advantageous that the described HCV FRET assay can be performed with any standard infectious HCV clone (i.e., no special reporters need to be engineered into the viral genome) and makes use of a sensitive commercially available internally quenched NS3 peptide substrate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background Information"}, {"text": "Cell culture.

Additionally, it is imperative that cells be mycoplasma free and greater than 90% viable before use, as HCV infection can be affected by all these variables. Culturing of Huh7 cells in 1% DMSO to induce cell growth arrest involves some additional considerations. First, while this method has proven successful with numerous distinct Huh7 cell lines, it is recommended that each cell line be tested individually to ensure cells behave as expected (e.g., cell growth cessation and liver-specific gene expression enhancement occurring at approximately day 6 post DMSO treatment). One potential problem with DMSO treatment is excess DMSO, which can result in Huh7 cell death and cytotoxicity. When preparing Huh7 cell maintenance medium with 1% (v/v) DMSO, accurately measure all volumes to ensure a final DMSO concentration of 1%. The use of tissue-culture-grade DMSO (Sigma) is recommended. Another potential problem is the overgrowth of Huh7 cells in the presence of 1% DMSO. This can happen when the Huh7 cell maintenance medium with 1% DMSO is initially added to cultures too late, when the cells are already confluent or overconfluent rather than 85% to 90% confluent. The judgement regarding when to add the 1% DMSO-containing medium is subjective, and this should be determined empirically before beginning large-scale experiments with DMSO-treated cultures. Lastly, during the 20-day incubation period, medium must be changed every 2 to 3 days, as Huh7 cells incubated in the presence of 1% DMSO are extremely metabolically active, and thus utilize nutrients at rates significantly faster than their actively dividing counterparts. As such, medium pH quickly becomes acidic, and nutrients are rapidly exhausted, particularly after 6 days of DMSO treatment; medium changes every 2 days are therefore necessary. HCV infection.

Of major importance in the generation of high-titer HCVcc stocks is the state of the cells during propagation. Under optimal cellular conditions, JFH-1 HCVcc should grow to titers of 10 5 ffu/ml; however, overconfluency, mycoplasma contamination, and other changes in the state of the host cell can negatively impact HCV RNA replication and de novo virus production (Pietschmann et al., 2001; Windisch et al., 2005; Nelson and Tang, 2006; Sainz and Chisari, 2006) . Thus, it is critical to use Huh7 cells that have been maintained in a healthy growth state and that have not been allowed to become over-confluent at the time of transfection, infection, or at any point thereafter. Moreover, during long-term passaging, Huh7 cell permissiveness for HCVcc infection can fluctuate (Corcoran et al., unpub. observ.) . Hence, particularly to ensure reproducibility throughout large-scale HCV screening efforts, it is recommended that Huh7 cell passage be monitored such that cells are only cultured for a limited number of passages (i.e., \u223c15 splits). At this time, cells should be discarded and an equivalent frozen aliquot thawed for continued use. Obviously, this requires that cells to be used be initially expanded and that large numbers of parallel aliquots be frozen for future use.
