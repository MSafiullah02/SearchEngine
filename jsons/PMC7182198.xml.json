After increases in the number of coronavirus genome sequences available following efforts to investigate the diversity in the wild, the family Coronaviridae now contains four genera (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, [6]). While those species that belong to the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus can infect mammalian hosts, those in Gammacoronavirus and the recently defined Deltacoronavirus mainly infect avian species [4, 7\u20139]. Phylogenetic studies have revealed a complex evolutionary history, with coronaviruses thought to have ancient origins and recent crossover events that can lead to cross-species infection [8, 10\u201312]. Some of the largest sources of diversity for coronaviruses belong to the strains that infect bats and birds, providing a reservoir in wild animals for recombination and mutation that may enable cross-species transmission into other mammals and humans [4, 7, 8, 10, 13].",

RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) have high mutation rates, reaching from 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10000 nucleotides during replication [7, 14, 15]. Coronaviruses are also known to use a template switching mechanism which can contribute to high rates of homologous RNA recombination between their viral genomes [9, 16\u201320]. Furthermore, the large size of coronavirus genomes is thought to be able to accommodate mutations to genes [7]. These factors help contribute to the plasticity and diversity of coronavirus genomes today.",

From phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp protein, spike proteins, and full genomes of the COVID-19 virus and other coronaviruses, it was found that the COVID-19 virus is most closely related to two bat SARS-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45, found in Chinese horseshoe bats Rhinolophus sinicus [12, 33\u201337]. Along with the phylogenetic data, the genome organization of the COVID-19 virus was found to be typical of lineage B (Sarbecovirus) Betacoronaviruses [33]. From phylogenetic analysis of full genome alignment and similarity plots, it was found that the COVID-19 virus has the highest similarity to the bat coronavirus RaTG13 [38]. Close associations to bat coronavirus RaTG13 and two bat SARS-like CoVs (ZC45 and ZXC21) are also supported in alignment-based phylogenetic analyses [38]. Within the COVID-19 virus sequences, over 99% sequence similarity and a lack of diversity within these strains suggest a common lineage and source, with support for recent emergence of the human strain [12, 31]. There is ongoing debate whether the COVID-19 virus arose following recombination with previously identified bat and unknown coronaviruses [39] or arose independently as a new lineage to infect humans [38]. In combination with the identification that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein is a receptor for COVID-19 virus, as it is for SARS and other Sarbecovirus strains, the hypothesis that the COVID-19 virus originated from bats is deemed very likely [12, 33, 35, 38, 40\u201344].",

            "text": "All analyses performed thus far have been alignment-based and rely on the annotations of the viral genes. Though alignment-based methods have been successful in finding sequence similarities, their application can be challenging in many cases [45, 46]. It is realistically impossible to analyze thousands of complete genomes using alignment-based methods due to the heavy computation time. Moreover, the alignment demands the sequences to be continuously homologous which is not always the case. Alignment-free methods [47\u201351] have been proposed in the past as an alternative to address the limitations of the alignment-based methods. Comparative genomics beyond alignment-based approaches have benefited from the computational power of machine learning. Machine learning-based alignment-free methods have also been used successfully for a variety of problems including virus classification [49\u201351]. An alignment-free approach [49] was proposed for subtype classification of HIV-1 genomes and achieved \u223c97% classification accuracy. MLDSP [50], with the use of a broad range of 1D numerical representations of DNA sequences, has also achieved very high levels of classification accuracy with viruses. Even rapidly evolving, plastic genomes of viruses such as Influenza and Dengue are classified down to the level of strain and subtype, respectively with 100% classification accuracy. MLDSP-GUI [51] provides an option to use 2D Chaos Game Representation (CGR) [52] as numerical representation of DNA sequences. CGR\u2019s have a longstanding use in species classification with identification of biases in sequence composition [48, 51, 52]. MLDSP-GUI has shown 100% classification accuracy for Flavivirus genus to species classification using 2D CGR as numerical representation [51]. MLDSP and MLDSP-GUI have demonstrated the ability to identify the genomic signatures (a species-specific pattern known to be pervasive throughout the genome) with species level accuracy that can be used for sequence (dis)similarity analyses. In this study, we use MLDSP [50] and MLDSP-GUI [51] with CGR as a numerical representation of DNA sequences to assess the classification of the COVID-19 virus from the perspective of machine learning-based alignment-free whole genome comparison of genomic signatures. Using MLDSP and MLDSP-GUI, we confirm that the COVID-19 virus belongs to the Betacoronavirus, while its genomic similarity to the sub-genus Sarbecovirus supports a possible bat origin.",

As MLDSP-GUI is an extension of the MLDSP methodology, we will refer to the method hereafter as MLDSP-GUI. Each genomic sequence is mapped into its respective genomic signal (a discrete numeric sequence) using a numerical representation. For this study, we use a two-dimensional k-mer (oligomers of length k) based numerical representation known as Chaos Game Representation (CGR) [52]. The k-mer value 7 is used for all the experiments. The value k = 7 achieved the highest accuracy scores for the HIV-1 subtype classification [49] and this value could be relevant for other virus related analyses. The magnitude spectra are then calculated by applying Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to the genomic signals [50]. A pairwise distance matrix is then computed using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) [53] as a distance measure between magnitude spectra. The distance matrix is used to generate the 3D Molecular Distance Maps (MoDMap3D) [54] by applying the classical Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) [55]. MoDMap3D represents an estimation of the relationship among sequences based on the genomic distances between the sequences. The feature vectors are constructed from the columns of the distance matrix and are used as an input to train six supervised-learning based classification models (Linear Discriminant, Linear SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine KNN, Subspace Discriminant, and Subspace KNN) [50]. A 10-fold cross-validation is used to train, and test the classification models and the average of 10 runs is reported as the classification accuracy. The trained machine learning models are then used to test the COVID-19 virus sequences. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) [56] and neighbor-joining [57] phylogenetic trees are also computed using the pairwise distance matrix.",

For validation of MLDSP-GUI results using CGR as a numerical representation, we use Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient [58\u201361], as follows. The frequency of each k-mer is calculated in each genome. Due to differences in genome length between species, proportional frequencies are computed by dividing each k-mer frequency by the length of the respective sequence.

The maximum classification accuracy of 98.4% with CGR at k = 7 as the numerical representation is obtained using the Quadratic SVM model. The respective MoDMap3D is shown in Fig 2(a).

Most early cases of individuals infected with the COVID-19 virus had contact with the Huanan South China Seafood Market [26\u201331]. Human-to-human transmission is confirmed, further highlighting the need for continued intervention [33, 62\u201364]. Still, the early COVID-19 virus genomes that have been sequenced and uploaded are over 99% similar, suggesting these infections result from a recent cross-species event [12, 31, 40].",

When analyzing the conserved replicase domains of ORF1ab for coronavirus species classification, nearly 94% of amino acid residues were identical to SARS-CoV, yet overall genome similarity was only around 70%, confirming that the COVID-19 virus was genetically different [64]. Within the RdRp region, it was found that another bat coronavirus, RaTG13, was the closest relative to the COVID-19 virus and formed a distinct lineage from other bat SARS-like coronaviruses [38, 40]. Other groups found that two bat SARS-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, were also closely related to the COVID-19 virus [12, 33\u201337]. There is a consensus that these three bat viruses are most similar to the COVID-19 virus, however, whether or not the COVID-19 virus arose from a recombination event is still unknown [38\u201340].",

            "text": "Regardless of the stance on recombination, current consensus holds that the hypothesis of the COVID-19 virus originating from bats is highly likely. Bats have been identified as a reservoir of mammalian viruses and cross-species transmission to other mammals, including humans [4, 7, 8, 10, 13, 65\u201367]. Prior to intermediary cross-species infection, the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were also thought to have originated in bats [24, 25, 34, 68\u201370]. Many novel SARS-like coronaviruses have been discovered in bats across China, and even in European, African and other Asian countries [34, 71\u201377]. With widespread geographic coverage, SARS-like coronaviruses have likely been present in bats for a long period of time and novel strains of these coronaviruses can arise through recombination [4]. Whether or not the COVID-19 virus was transmitted directly from bats, or from intermediary hosts, is still unknown, and will require identification of the COVID-19 virus in species other than humans, notably from the wet market and surrounding area it is thought to have originated from [30]. While bats have been reported to have been sold at the Huanan market, at this time, it is still unknown if there were intermediary hosts involved prior to transmission to humans [27, 31, 33, 39, 78]. Snakes had been proposed as an intermediary host for the COVID-19 virus based on relative synonymous codon usage bias studies between viruses and their hosts [39], however, this claim has been disputed [79]. China CDC released information about environmental sampling in the market and indicated that 33 of 585 samples had evidence of the COVID-19 virus, with 31 of these positive samples taken from the location where wildlife booths were concentrated, suggesting possible wildlife origin [80, 81]. Detection of SARS-CoV in Himalyan palm civets and horseshoe bats identified 29 nucleotide sequences that helped trace the origins of SARS-CoV isolates in humans to these intermediary species [13, 24, 38, 77]. Sampling additional animals at the market and wildlife in the surrounding area may help elucidate whether intermediary species were involved or not, as was possible with the SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "Viral outbreaks like COVID-19 demand timely analysis of genomic sequences to guide the research in the right direction. This problem being time-sensitive requires quick sequence similarity comparison against thousands of known sequences to narrow down the candidates of possible origin. Alignment-based methods are known to be time-consuming and can be challenging in cases where homologous sequence continuity cannot be ensured. It is challenging (and sometimes impossible) for alignment-based methods to compare a large number of sequences that are too different in their composition. Alignment-free methods have been used successfully in the past to address the limitations of the alignment-based methods [48\u201351]. The alignment-free approach is quick and can handle a large number of sequences. Moreover, even the sequences coming from different regions with different compositions can be easily compared quantitatively, with equally meaningful results as when comparing homologous/similar sequences. We use MLDSP-GUI (a variant of MLDSP with additional features), a machine learning-based alignment-free method successfully used in the past for sequence comparisons and analyses [50]. The main advantage alignment-free methodology offers is the ability to analyze large datasets rapidly. In this study we confirm the taxonomy of the COVID-19 virus and, more generally, propose a method to efficiently analyze and classify a novel unclassified DNA sequence against the background of a large dataset. We namely use a \u201cdecision tree\u201d approach (paralleling taxonomic ranks), and start with the highest taxonomic level, train the classification models on the available complete genomes, test the novel unknown sequences to predict the label among the labels of the training dataset, move to the next taxonomic level, and repeat the whole process down to the lowest taxonomic label.",

There is only one realm available in the viral taxonomy, so all of the families that belong to the realm Riboviria are placed into a single cluster and a random collection of 500 sequences are selected. No realm is defined for the remaining 11 families. The objective is to train the classification models with the known viral genomes and then predict the labels of the COVID-19 virus sequences. The maximum classification accuracy score of 95% was obtained using the Quadratic SVM model. This test demonstrates that MLDSP-GUI can distinguish between different viral families. The trained models are then used to predict the labels of 29 COVID-19 virus sequences. As expected, all classification models correctly predict that the COVID-19 virus sequences belong to the Riboviria realm, see Table 2. Test-2 is composed of 12 families from the Riboviria, see Table 1, and the goal is to test if MLDSP-GUI is sensitive enough to classify the sequences at the next lower taxonomic level. It should be noted that as we move down the taxonomic levels, sequences become much more similar to one another and the classification problem becomes challenging. MLDSP-GUI is still able to distinguish between the sequences within the Riboviria realm with a maximum classification accuracy of 91.1% obtained using the Linear Discriminant classification model. When the COVID-19 virus sequences are tested using the models trained on Test-2, all of the models correctly predict the COVID-19 virus sequences as Coronaviridae (Table 2). Test-3a moves down another taxonomic level and classifies the Coronaviridae family to four genera (Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus), see Table 1. MLDSP-GUI distinguishes sequences at the genus level with a maximum classification accuracy score of 98%, obtained using the Linear Discriminant model. This is a very high accuracy rate considering that no alignment is involved and the sequences are very similar. All trained classification models correctly predict the COVID-19 virus as Betacoronavirus, see Table 2. Test-3a has Betacoronavirus as the largest cluster and it can be argued that the higher accuracy could be a result of this bias. To avoid bias, we did an additional test removing the smallest cluster Gammacoronavirus and limiting the size of remaining three clusters to the size of the cluster with the minimum number of sequences i.e. 20 with Test-3b. MLDSP-GUI obtains 100% classification accuracy for this additional test and still predicts all of the COVID-19 virus sequences as Betacoronavirus. These tests confirm that the COVID-19 virus sequences are from the genus Betacoronavirus.",

            "text": "Sequences become very similar at lower taxonomic levels (sub-genera and species). Test-4, Test-5, and Test-6 investigate within the genus Betacoronavirus for sub-genus classification. Test-4 is designed to classify Betacoronavirus into the four sub-genera (Embecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus, Sarbecovirus), see Table 3. MLDSP-GUI distinguishes sequences at the sub-genus level with a maximum classification accuracy score of 98.4%, obtained using the Quadratic SVM model. All of the classification models trained on the dataset in Test-4 predicted the label of all 29 COVID-19 virus sequences as Sarbecovirus. This suggests substantial similarity between the COVID-19 virus and the Sarbecovirus sequences. Test-5 and Test-6 (see Table 3) are designed to verify that the COVID-19 virus sequences can be differentiated from the known species in the Betacoronavirus genus. MLDSP-GUI achieved a maximum classification score of 98.7% for Test-5 and 100% for Test-6 using Subspace Discriminant classification model. This shows that although the COVID-19 virus and Sarbecovirus are closer on the basis of genomic similarity (Test-4), they are still distinguishable from known species. Therefore, these results suggest that the COVID-19 virus may represent a genetically distinct species of Sarbecovirus. All the COVID-19 virus sequences are visually seen in MoDMap3D generated from Test-5 (see Fig 2(b)) as a closely packed cluster and it supports a fact that there is 99% similarity among these sequences [12, 31]. The MoDMap3D generated from the Test-5 (Fig 2(b)) visually suggests and the average distances from COVID-19 virus sequences to all other sequences confirm that the COVID-19 virus sequences are most proximal to the RaTG13 (distance: 0.0203), followed by the bat-SL-CoVZC45 (0.0418), and bat-SL-CoVZX21 (0.0428). To confirm this proximity, UPGMA and neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees are computed from the PCC-based pairwise distance matrix of sequences in Test-6, see Figs 3 and 4. Notably, the UPGMA model assumes that all lineages are evolving at a constant rate (equal evolution rate among branches). This method may produce unreliable results in cases where the genomes of some lineages evolve more rapidly than those of the others. To further verify the phylogenetic relationships, we also produced a phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining method that allows different evolution rates among branches and obtained a highly similar output. The phylogenetic trees placed the RaTG13 sequence closest to the COVID-19 virus sequences, followed by the bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 sequences. This closer proximity represents the smaller genetic distances between these sequences and aligns with the visual sequence relationships shown in the MoDMap3D of Fig 2(b).",

Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient [58\u201361] tests were applied to the frequencies of oligonucleotide segments, adjusting for the total number of segments, to measure the degree and statistical significance of correlation between two sets of genomic sequences. Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 value provides the degree of correlation between the two groups and their k-mer frequencies. The COVID-19 virus was compared to all genera under the Coronaviridae family and the k-mer frequencies showed the strongest correlation to the genus Betacoronavirus, and more specifically Sarbecovirus. The Spearman\u2019s rank tests corroborate that the COVID-19 virus is part of the Sarbecovirus sub-genus, as shown by CGR and MLDSP. When analyzing sub-genera, it could be hard to classify at lower k values due to the short oligonucleotide frequencies not capturing enough information to highlight the distinctions. Therefore despite the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient providing results for k = 1 to k = 7, the higher k-mer lengths provided more accurate results, and k = 7 was used.",

Vertebrate genomes are known to have an under-representation of CG dinucleotides in their genomes, otherwise known as CG suppression [82, 83]. This feature is thought to have been due to the accumulation of spontaneous deamination mutations of methyl-cytosines over time [82]. As viruses are obligate parasites, evolution of viral genomes is intimately tied to the biology of their hosts [84]. As host cells develop strategies such as RNA interference and restriction-modification systems to prevent and limit viral infections, viruses will continue to counteract these strategies [83\u201385]. Dinucleotide composition and biases are pervasive across the genome and make up a part of the organism\u2019s genomic signature [84]. These host genomes have evolutionary pressures that shape the host genomic signature, such as the pressure to eliminate CG dinucleotides within protein coding genes in humans [83]. Viral genomes have been shown to mimic the same patterns of the hosts, including single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses, which suggests that many RNA viruses can evolve to mimic the same features of their host\u2019s genes and genomic signature [82\u201386]. As genomic composition, specifically in mRNA, can be used as a way of discriminating self vs non-self RNA, the viral genomes are likely shaped by the same pressures that influence the host genome [83]. One such pressure on DNA and RNA is the APOBEC family of enzymes, members of which are known to cause G to A mutations [86\u201388]. While these enzymes primarily work on DNA, it has been demonstrated that these enzymes can also target RNA viral genomes [87]. The APOBEC enzymes therefore have RNA editing capability and may help contribute to the innate defence system against various RNA viruses [86]. This could therefore have a direct impact on the genomic signature of RNA viruses. Additional mammalian mechanisms for inhibiting viral RNA have been highlighted for retroviruses with the actions of zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) [82]. ZAP targets CG dinucleotide sequences, and in vertebrate host cells with the CG suppression in host genomes, this can serve as a mechanism for the distinction of self vs non-self RNA and inhibitory consequences [82]. Coronaviruses have A/U rich and C/G poor genomes, which over time may have been, in part, a product of cytidine deamination and selection against CG dinucleotides [89\u201391]. This is consistent with the fact that bats serve as a reservoir for many coronaviruses and that bats have been observed to have some of the largest and most diverse arrays of APOBEC genes in mammals [67, 69]. The Spearman\u2019s rank correlation data and the patterns observed in the CGR images from Fig 5, of the coronavirus genomes, including the COVID-19 virus identify patterns such as CG underepresentation, also present in vertebrate and, importantly, bat host genomes.",
