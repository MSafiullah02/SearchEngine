            "text": "ZIKV is an arthropod-born virus (arbovirus) of genus Flavivirus, which includes Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus, Yellow fever virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus (Lanciotti et al., 2008, Lazear and Diamond, 2016, Solomon, 2016). ZIKV was isolated for the first time from a Rhesus monkey in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 (Dick, 1952a, Dick, 1952b). ZIKV is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, especially Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Symptoms of infection include fever, skin rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis (Hayes, 2009), but up to 80% of patients are asymptomatic (Duffy et al., 2009, Petersen et al., 2016, Slavov et al., 2016). ZIKV infection of humans by viruses of the African and Asian lineages was of marginal importance until the end of 20th century. In 2007, however, the first outbreak was reported in Yap Island in Micronesia, where the virus was transmitted by Aedes aegypti (Lanciotti et al., 2008). A widespread epidemic of the Asian lineage of ZIKV was reported in New Caledonia and French Polynesia from 2013 to 2015. ZIKV reached Brazil in 2013, and shortly thereafter, the virus spread among other countries in South and Central America (Faria et al., 2016). In 2015, the number of cases of pregnancy-associated microcephaly suddenly increased in Brazil, in close association with a concurrent outbreak of ZIKV. A growing body of evidence indicates that ZIKV infection in pregnant women causes congenital abnormalities and fetal demise (Brasil et al., 2016, Li et al., 2016, Miner et al., 2016, Sarno et al., 2016, Ventura et al., 2016). However, the mechanism underlying these phenomena remains unknown, and no therapy for these cases has been established.",

Furthermore, ZIKV-infected pregnant mice of SJL strain yield pups with congenital fetal abnormalities (Cugola et al., 2016). SJL mice carry mutations in the Tyk2 gene, which is critical for type I IFN signaling (Izumi et al., 2015). These studies indicate that ZIKV is transmissible to the fetus, leading to defects in fetal development, and suggest that the type I IFN response plays an important role in ZIKV phylaxis in mice.",

Ribavirin exerts its antiviral effect by inhibiting viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Bougie and Bisaillon, 2003, Maag et al., 2001, Toltzis et al., 1988), inhibiting mRNA cap formation (Goswami et al., 1979), and up-regulating genes related to IFN signaling (Feld et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2003), as well as other mechanisms. Like ZIKV and DENV, HCV is a member of family Flaviviridae. Recent work showed that ribavirin inhibited DENV replication in Vero cells (Rattanaburee et al., 2015), suggesting that the drug might also be an effective inhibitor of ZIKV replication.",

We have found that the combination of ribavirin and IFN-\u03b2, as well as ribavirin or IFN-\u03b2 alone inhibited ZIKV replication in vitro. They could inhibit the viral replication in Vero cells (a monkey cell line), SH-SY5Y cells (a human cell line), and C6/36 cells (a mosquito cell line). Moreover, we found that mice carrying a null mutation in the gene encoding STAT1, which is essential for type I IFN signaling, were highly susceptible to lethal infection with ZIKV. Finally, we found that administration of ribavirin inhibited in the early stage of viremia in ZIKV-infected STAT1-deficient mice. Taken together, these results indicate that ribavirin potently inhibits ZIKV replication both in vitro and in vivo, and administration of RNA polymerase inhibitors may be effective treatment strategy for the prevention of ZIKV infection.",

In addition, we quantified apoptotic and dead cells by flow cytometry using a fluorescent conjugate of annexin V and the amine-reactive fluorescent dye Zombie Red. As shown in Fig. 4B, annexin V+ apoptotic cells and Zombie Red+ dead cells could be detected in 3.1% and 0.9% of uninfected Vero cells, respectively. On the other hand, the proportions of dead cells in ZIKV-infected Vero cells increased to 80.2%. Consistent with the microscopic observation, the ratio of dead cells began to reduce at concentrations of 62.5 \u03bcg/mL and 125 \u03bcg/mL of ribavirin though the proportions of apoptotic cells were slightly increased. The ratio of apoptotic and dead cells in the presence of 250 \u03bcg/mL of ribavirin was almost comparable to those in uninfected cells. No cytotoxicity was observed even in the presence of 2000 \u03bcg/mL of ribavirin. Taken together, these results suggest that ribavirin prevents ZIKV-induced apoptosis and cell death without cytotoxicity.",

It has been reported that in the plaque reduction assay, ganciclovir inhibited plaque formation at a concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM effectively (Tanaka et al., 2004). As expected, ganciclovir could not inhibit the plaque formation by ZIKV (Fig. 5\nA and B).

Because STAT1 functions as a signal transducer in the IFNAR1 pathway, we attempted to establish a ZIKV-infected mouse model using STAT1-deficient mice. An acute weight loss was observed in ZIKV-infected STAT1-deficient mice from day 3 post infection, and died between 6 and 9 day post infection losing 30\u201340% of original body weight (Fig. 6\nA). Moreover, the viral infection resulted in significant hypothermia from day 4 post infection (Fig. 6B). Two days prior to the lethal outcome, the mice displayed abnormal behavior such as ataxic gait and shivering. Moreover, we analysed viremia by RT-PCR assay (Fig. 6C). An intense viremia began to be observed by day 2 post infection, however, interestingly, it started to decrease by day 5 post infection and subsequently, the mice died by day 8 post infection. We also quantified the viremia by real-time RT-PCR assay revealing that the level of viremia on day 3 post infection was more than a thousand times greater than that on day 1 post infection (Fig. 6D). This suggests rapid and robust virus replication in STAT1-deficient mice. These results indicate that STAT1-deficient mice are useful as a mouse model of lethal infection with ZIKV.",

We administrated 15 mg of ribavirin intraperitoneally to ZIKV-infected STAT1-deficient mice for 3 consecutive days after infection. Although ribavirin treatment suppressed the viremia until 4 days after infection, RT-PCR bands were observed 2 days after discontinuation of ribavirin administration (day 5 post infection) (Fig. 6C). Ribavirin treatment significantly suppressed the levels of viremia on day 2 and 3 post infection compared to those of untreated mice (less than one-tenth and one-thousandth, respectively), however, the levels of viremia were comparable between two groups on day 5 post infection (Fig. 6D). On the other hand, ribavirin treatment failed to suppress the viral load in the brain on day 3 (data not shown) and day 5 post infection (Fig. 6G). Moreover, daily administration of 10 mg of ribavirin intraperitoneally to ZIKV-infected STAT1-deficient mice significantly prolonged the survival time (Fig. 6E). Consistent with Fig. 6D, an intense viremia on day 2 post infection was inhibited by ribavirin but the low levels of viremia sustained until the death of these mice (Fig. 6F). In previous reports, administration of approximately 1\u20132 mg of ribavirin in DENV-infected mice and ZIKV-infected mice failed to reduce viremia in AG129 mice (Schul et al., 2007, Chang et al., 2011, Julander et al., 2017). Thus, we evaluated the effect of low doses of ribavirin in our mouse model, however, 2 mg of ribavirin could not suppress the viremia and not prolong the survival. (Suppl. Fig. 1). These data indicate that high-doses of ribavirin efficiently abrogate ZIKV viremia in the early stage of infection, leading to a prolonged survival of STAT1-deficient mice.",

However, ZIKV infection of pregnant women results in microcephaly and other developmental disorders in newborns, representing a major public health problem. To resolve the issue, rapid development of drugs that are useful for the prevention of Zika fever is necessary. Because it takes several years to develop a new drug, we tested the widely used antiviral drugs to examine the efficacy against ZIKV. As both HCV and ZIKV belong to family Flaviviridae, we hypothesized that ribavirin, a drug used to treat hepatitis C, would exert suppressive effects on ZIKV. Although it has been reported that ribavirin cannot inhibit ZIKV replication in Vero cells (Julander et al., 2017), we found that ribavirin potently inhibited ZIKV replication not only in Vero cells but also in human neuroblastoma cell line (Fig. 1, Fig. 2A). In addition, IFN-\u03b2 also inhibited ZIKV replication in Vero cells, though the combination did not exert synergistic effect (Fig. 1D). Since most of Zika-endemic areas are developing countries and IFN-\u03b2 is very expensive, a clinical application of IFN-\u03b2 is difficult for such areas. In this study, we examined the efficacy of ribavirin against ZIKV infection because it is an affordable drug.",

            "text": "Generally, ZIKV can infect mainly primates but not wild-type mice. A few mouse models were reported, so far. For example, Ifnar1-deficient mice that lack type I IFN receptors are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection (Lazear et al., 2016). Furthermore, SJL mice that are defective for type I IFN signaling can be infected with ZIKV. It has been reported that the vertical infection could be occurred by trans-placental transmission in ZIKV-infected pregnant SJL mice (Cugola et al., 2016). However, we failed to confirm the ZIKV infection in SJL mice, in which viremia and lethal outcome were not observed (data not shown). In this study, we found that STAT1-deficient mice, which lack type I IFN signaling, were highly sensitive to ZIKV infection and exhibited lethal outcome. The viremia was observed 2\u20134 days after infection, however the levels of viremia decreased 5 days after infection without treatment for unknown reasons. Using this mouse model, we have demonstrated that ribavirin could successfully control ZIKV viremia and prolong the survival time significantly (Fig. 6C, E). However, ZIKV load in the brains were comparable between ribavirin-treated and untreated groups on day 5 post infection (Fig. 6G) and the low levels of viremia observed until the death of the mice treated with ribavirin (Fig. 6F), which suggests that ribavirin could not completely eliminate ZIKV. These results account for the lethal outcome in ZIKV-infected STAT1-deficient mice, however the mechanism underlying the prolonged mouse survival is still uncertain. We have shown that administration of ribavirin for the first three days after infection failed to prolong the survival of infected mice, even though they were treated with 15 mg of ribavirin (Fig. 6C). Schul et al. treated DENV-infected mice with 75 mg/kg of ribavirin for 3 day-consecutive administration. On the contrary, continuous administration of 10 mg of ribavirin throughout the course of infection could successfully prolong the survival (Fig. 6E). Thus the treatment regimens are critical for the control of ZIKV. On the other hand, daily administration of 2 mg (lower dose) of ribavirin, which resembles the doses used by other groups (Schul et al., 2007, Chang et al., 2011, Julander et al., 2017), could not prolong the survival of ZIKV-infected STAT1-deficient mice (Supplementary Fig. 1). The data suggests that daily administration of a high concentration of ribavirin is required to prolong the survival time of ZIKV-infected STAT1-deficient mice. Although low doses of ribavirin could inhibit viral replication judged by RT-PCR assay (Fig. 1), high doses of ribavirin were required for the suppression of apoptosis of infected cells judged by plaque assay (Fig. 3). Thus, even the viremia judged by RT-PCR assay appeared to be suppressed, apoptosis of cerebral nerve cell might be induced. The mechanism underlying lethal outcome of ZIKV-infected STAT1-deficient mice remains to be solved.",
