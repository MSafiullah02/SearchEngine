The current defi nition of asthma combines clinicalpathological presence of chronic infl ammatory airway with hyperresponsiveness and episodic airway obstruction with variable degrees of reversibility with treatment or spontaneously [ 1 ] . Asthma is worldwide and is of pandemic levels for the past 30 years, with >300 million people affl icted globally [ 2 ] . Although asthma is considered more common in affl uent and developed countries, approximately half are in developing countries [ 3 ] , which account for more than two-thirds of the world's population. It is estimated that asthma accounts for 25,000 annual deaths, and that by 2025 the number of asthmatics will increase by more than 100 million new cases [ 2 , 4 ] . In the United States 8.4 % of the population has asthma with substantial annual morbidity of 500,000 hospitalization and 1.9 million emergency visits, at an annual cost of $56 billion [ 5 ] .",

            "text": "Traditionally asthma has been considered a condition as a result of a complex interaction between multiple genetic infl uences and environmental stimuli. Studies of twins in families of subjects with asthma show an inheritable pattern but the current data indicate that asthma is likely transmitted by multiple genes [ 6 ] . Different genes may lead to the same phenotype in separate individuals [locus heterogeneity], and multiple genes acting in the same individual [polygenic inheritance] may lead in the expression of the asthma phenotype [ 6 ] . Some genes infl uence the development of asthma and others may infl uence the severity of the disease or responses to treatment. Genome-wide association studies have recently identifi ed the number of genes that are important in the development of asthma. Two key genes, IL-33 and IL-1 receptor-like 1 [IL1RL1], act in this signal transduction pathway [ 7 ] . IL-33 encodes a cytokine released on damages cells and IL1RL1 encodes part of the receptor complex. Functional studies in humans and mouse models of allergic airway disease indicate a key role of IL-33 signaling in driving the Th2 infl ammation, which is pivotal in allergic asthma [ 7 ] . The IL-33/IL1RL1 pathway can activate innate immune cells to produce cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13 in the lungs [ 8 , 19 ] .",

This elite group of genes, include those encoding IL-4, IL-13, ADRB2, TNF, HLA-DRB, FCER1B, IL4RA, CD14, HLA-DQB1, and ADAM 33 [ 10 ] . Asthma susceptibility genes may be classifi ed according to four main functions: Innate immunity and immunoregulation [e.g., CD14, HLA genes, and TLR4]; Th2-cell differentiation/activity [e.g., IL4/IL4R, IL 13, and FCER1B]; epithelial biology and mucosal immunity [e.g., CCL genes and FLG]; and lung function, airway remodeling, and asthma severity [e.g., ADRB2 and TNF] [ 11 , 12 ] . IL-13 has been one of the best studied candidate gene for asthma and allergy, and has been consistently implicated in genome-wide based studies [ 13 , 14 ] .",

For example, environmental factors may cause changes in gene expression through noncoding changes to the DNA, i.e., DNA methylation [ 15 ] . There are several observations supporting a pathogenic role of epigenetics, including the complexity of gene-environment interactions. The concordance rate of only 50 % in monozygotic asthmatic twins supports nongenetic factors [ 16 ] . Common epigenetic mechanisms, such as prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke or air pollutants altering DNA methylation, may result in increased or decreased gene expressions [ 121 ] . For example, expression of ADAM 33 in bronchial epithelial and fi broblasts cells has been shown to be controlled by epigenetic mechanisms [ 12 ] . Currently epigenetic analyses in respiratory diseases have been limited to certain candidate genes, i.e., FOXP3 involved in regulation of T-cell function and no large-scale studies have been published [ 17 ] .",

The infl ammation and exaggerated airway responsiveness is associated with mucus hypersecretion, often with increased eosinophils locally and systemically. At the cellular level the changes consist of airway remodeling characterized by smooth muscle hyperplasia, subepithelial cell fi brosis, goblet cell hyperplasia, and neovascularization [ 18 ] . The airway infl ammation which is a major component of asthma involves infl ux of mast cells, neutrophils, Th-2 cells, and eosinophils. On exposure to allergen or infectious agent the physiological changes that occur are driven by Th-2 infl ammation, with increased Th-2 cytokines [IL-4, IL-5, IL-9,  and IL-13] , and decreased anti-infl ammatory cytokines, i.e., IL-10 [ 18 ] . The heightened Th-2 response causes activation of natural killer cells, dendritic cells and eosinophils, which result in eosinophilia, increased matrix metalloprotease activity, increase in serum IgE levels, and promotion of smooth muscle hypercontraction. IL-13 is central to the progression of asthma and is produced in response to toll-like receptor-4 [TLR-4] signaling, and many micro-RNAs are directly or indirectly involved in the production and upregulation [ 18 ] .",

In established asthma respiratory viral infections attract bronchial infl ammatory cells, alter airway receptor expression on smooth muscle cells, and modulate neuroimmune mechanisms, leading to bronchospasm and exacerbation of disease [ 36 ] . Multiple mechanisms are probably involved including loss of function or downregulation of M2 muscarinic receptors on the airway parasympathetic nerves, which normally inhibit vagal-mediated bronchospasm [ 37 ] . Interferons produced in response to viral infections downregulate the expression of the M2 receptor gene, and eosinophils recruited by allergens release major basic proteins, which bind to the M2 receptors and block their function [ 37 ] . Thus a multitude of respiratory viruses that can cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections and a few atypical bacteria can cause exacerbation of asthma.",

Although RSV bronchiolitis increase the risk of frequent [>3 episodes per year] or infrequent [<3 episodes per year of wheezing], the risk gradually decreased by age 13. The results of this study may be explained by a more recent study assessing recurrent wheezing and development of asthma in a birth cohort followed for 13 years, and the relationship to perennial allergen exposure and sensitization [ 41 ] . Chronic asthma developed in atopic children in the fi rst 3 years of life to repeated exposures to allergens, and determined by continuing allergic airway infl ammation characterized by airway-hyperresponsiveness and impairment of lung function at a later age school age. Whereas children with nonatopic wheezing phenotype lose their symptoms over school age and retain normal pulmonary function at a later age [ 41 ] . Other studies have suggested that RSV bronchiolitis predispose to recurrent wheezing and asthma in the genetically predisposed children [ 42 , 43 ] . A large epidemiological study from Tennessee [USA] found that children born approximately 120 days before the peak RSV season were at the highest risk for hospital admission with wheezing, and at a higher risk for later development of asthma [ 44 ] . However, the association of severe RSV infection in infancy and later development of asthma overlapped with genetic determinants in a study of 8,280 twin-pairs [ 45 ] . The investigators of this study concluded that severe RSV infection may not be the cause of asthma, but there was a genetic predisposition to both RSV bronchiolitis and asthma. The best evidence to date in support of a causal association between RSV infection and asthma is the result of the long-term study over 18 years in Swedish children. Children who had RSV bronchiolitis as infants compared to matched controls had a greater prevalence of asthma at 18 years old, 39 % versus 9 % [ 46 ] . The affected children also demonstrated increase in perennial allergens sensitization [41 % versus 14 %] and recurrent episodes of wheezing, 30 % versus 1 %. In a previous study children with past bronchiolitis had an enhanced IL-4 response to RSV and cat allergen [Th-2 response], whereas controls had an equally strong interferon-gamma [IFN-\u03b3] response [Th-1 type] to RSV antigens [ 47 ] .",

In a recent prospective longitudinal study of 285 children with high risk for allergic diseases and asthma followed from birth, allergic sensitization leads to increased risk of RV-induced wheezing but not RSV infection up to 6 years [ 52 ] . However, viral wheeze did not lead to subsequent allergic sensitization. In an earlier study sensitization to common aeroallergens nearly doubled the risk for asthma at 6 years, and viral respiratory tract infection with wheezing quadrupled the risk for asthma over this time [ 53 ] . The combined effect appeared to be synergistic as the risk of asthma was ninefold greater with both wheezing episodes from respiratory infections and allergic sensitization. Recent evidence also suggests that RV infection induces bronchial epithelial production of a number of growth factors and other mediators [chemokines and cytokines] that could contribute to the development and progression of airway remodeling present in asthma [ 54 ] .",

            "text": "A central role in the pathogenesis of asthma is the allergen-specifi c IgE, the production of which is mediated by the Th-2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13 [ 38 ] . IgE receptors on mast cells and basophils bind to allergens, resulting in release of mediators such as histamine which produce airway infl ammation and hyperreactivity. It has been proposed that the immune dysfunction in infancy could predispose to recurrent viral lower respiratory tract infection and be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. In a community-based cohort of children, with a family history of atopy, relative defi ciency of circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells in infancy was correlated with increased frequency and severity of viral respiratory infections, wheezing, and diagnoses of asthma [ 65 ] . The usual response to viral respiratory infections by a mature immune system is to stimulate proliferation of cytolytic T cells and the Th1-CD4 helper T cells. This results in release of IFN-\u03b3, upregulation of IL-12, and stimulation of macrophages [ 66 ] , typical for the Th1 response. However, there is experimental evidence that severe RSV infection in neonates could determine the pattern of T-cell-mediated disease during later life. Primary RSV infection in neonatal mice was associated with reduced and delayed IFN-\u03b3 responses, and subsequent reinfection resulted in increased infl ammatory cell recruitment, with a shift to increased Th2-cytokine and increased eosinophils, typical for allergy and asthma [ 67 ] . A similar animal model also confi rmed that viral respiratory infection in early life results in overproduction of the Th2-cytokines, IL-13, with increased risk for respiratory allergies, and changes in the airway structure conducive for asthma [ 68 ] . In clinical studies of acute exacerbation of asthma induced by viral infection, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrate increased expression of IFNresponsive genes and increased expression of Th2-chemokines, indicating enhanced allergic infl ammation linked to the innate antiviral response [ 69 , 70 ] .",

He proposed that increased infection in childhood had a protective role in allergic rhinitis and this concept was labeled the \"hygiene hypothesis\". However, it has since been noted by others that repeated viral lower respiratory tract infections in the fi rst 3 years of life appear to be associated with asthma at 7 years of age, whereas recurrent upper respiratory tract infection in early life reduced the risk of asthma at school age [ 72 ] . Multiple epidemiological studies from Europe and elsewhere have shown that people living on farms from childbirth through to adults, especially with exposure to livestock or consumption of unpasteurized milk, have signifi cantly lower prevalence of asthma and allergic rhinitis than the general population [ 73 ] . This is presumably due to greater environmental exposure to higher burden of multiple pathogens and microbes. The timing and duration of exposure to unhygienic environment appears to be critical, as the reduction in risk of allergic disease is greatest for those exposed prenatally and continuously until adulthood [ 73 ] . The maternal exposure to animal sheds and unpasteurized cow's milk has also been shown to infl uence the production of IgE antibodies in the cord blood of neonates [ 74 ] . Furthermore, children living on farms are exposed to higher bacterial components, endotoxin and muramic acid, from abundant mattress dust compared to nonfarm children. Exposure to the microbial laden mattress dust has been associated with lower frequency of wheezing, asthma, and hay fever [ 75 -77 ] . Similar fi ndings were reported in a case-controlled study from Chile, where daycare attendance and regular farm animal contact were inversely related to childhood asthma [ 78 ] . In a case-controlled study from Brazil the effect of crowding in the home environment was also associated with the development of asthma, crowding in the home was associated with a 60 % reduction in incidence of asthma, yet there was a 2.5-fold increase in incidence of lower respiratory tract infections [ 79 ] .",

Colonization of the gastrointestinal tract may be a refl ection of sanitation and exposure burden of microbes and this could support the hygiene hypothesis. The same investigators had previously reported that colonization with H. pylori [Cag A+] in adults was inversely associated with the presence of asthma or allergic rhinitis in a study of 7,663 subjects [ 87 ] . The combined infectious burden of H. pylori , Toxoplasmosis gondii , hepatitis A, herpes simplex 1, C. pneumoniae , Epstein-Barr virus, and Cytomegalovirus [determined by presence of antibodies] was associated with lower risk of atopy, asthma, and allergic rhinitis in 1,249 adults in Europe [ 88 ] . However, in other crosssectional studies in adults there was no association of H. pylori serological status and asthma or atopy [ 89 ] . Although in an experimental mouse model of allergic asthma, H. pylori infection could prevent asthma development through the induction of regulatory T cells [ 90 ] .",

This topic was reviewed in 2011, with the conclusion that it is biologically plausible that oral bacteria through immune mechanisms could infl uence the risk of allergic diseases, but the data was insuffi cient to draw any conclusions [ 92 ] . In a childhood birth cohort prospective study from Copenhagen, aspirates of the hypopharynx were obtained from asymptomatic 1-month-old infants of asthmatic mothers for bacterial culture and subsequently correlated with later development of asthma at 5 years of age [ 29 ] . Colonization of the hypopharynx with S. pneumoniae , H. infl uenzae , or Moraxella catarrhalis or with a combination of these organisms was at increased risk for recurrent wheeze and asthma in early life. A subsequent study has shown that polymorphism of the IL-17 gene was associated with childhood asthma and bacterial colonization of the hypopharynx in bronchiolitis [ 93 ] . Thus bacterial colonization of the hypopharynx in neonates and childhood asthma may be linked to a genetic predisposition. However, there is no evidence that antibiotics use in early life decreases or increases the risk for later development of asthma [ 94 ] . It has been postulated that bacterial colonization of the airway could be related to development of IgE against bacterial antigen, implicating a role for bacterial-specifi c type-2 immunity in the pathogenesis of asthma. Titers of IgE against H. infl uenzae and S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were measured in 1,380 teenagers and correlated with asthma and immunophenotypes [ 95 ] . IgE titers against S. aureusderived enterotoxins were highest among atopic subjects and were associated with increased risk of asthma. However, high IgE titers against H. infl uenzae and S. pneumoniae were associated with a decreased risk of asthma. The investigators postulated that lower availability of soluble forms of H. infl uenzae and S. pneumoniae antigens reduces the cross-link with IgE receptors systemically, but the availability of these antigens at the mucosal level to antigen presenting cells and type-2 memory cells could lead to mucosal secretion of IL-4/IL-13 producing an atopic response [ 95 ] .",

Diet itself has considerable effect on the composition of the gut microbiota, and experiments in mice show changes in their microbial composition, metabolic pathways, and gene expression just after 1 day on the Western diet [ 115 ] . The Western diet causes an increase in bacteria of the Firmicutes phylum and a decrease in those of the Bacteroidetes phylum. The gut microbiota of children in Africa is greatly different from those in Europe, and this is attributed primarily to dietary differences [ 115 ] . The examples provided by the authors to support the hypothesis of diet rather than hygiene affecting the incidence of asthma are the relatively low prevalence of asthma in Japan compared to Australia and the United States [ 115 ] . Japan has high a degree of sanitation and urbanization but much different diet that would infl uence the gut microbiota/microbiome.

Vitamin D is important for effective function of the innate and adaptive immunity. Vitamin D is associated with a dose-dependent reduction in the transcription of Th1-cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 and increase in the Th2-cytokines, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells culture [ 116 ] . Thus vitamin D has a key role in the Th1-Th2 balance. Defi ciency of vitamin D is common in children and adults of temperate regions of the world, and is associated with higher risk of upper and lower respiratory infections, especially in children. Only 10 % of vitamin D is acquired from ingested food and 90 % from synthesis after sunlight exposure. Therefore, the higher prevalence of vitamin D defi ciency seen in countries of the Northern hemisphere could explain the greater incidence of asthma in prosperous countries compared to poorer nations, which are predominantly located in tropical and subtropical regions of the globe. The link between vitamin D defi ciency and respiratory infections is particularly relevant in children who develop asthma after recurrent respiratory tract infection in early childhood. This seasonality of infl uenza and RSV-induced bronchiolitis has been linked to the greater prevalence of vitamin D defi ciency in the winter [ 117 , 118 ] . In a recent prospective birth cohort study of 156 healthy neonates, low concentration 5.6 Alternative Hypotheses Linking Microbes and Asthma of vitamin D from cord blood was associated with increased risk of RSV bronchiolitis in the fi rst year of life [ 119 ] .",
