            "text": "Influenza epidemics are observed around the world during the wintertime and with a strong seasonal component in temperate regions [1], [2]. Influenza is a disease caused by the influenza virus, an RNA virus belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae [3]. Many features are common with those of the paramyxovirus infections of the acute upper respiratory tract. Typical symptoms of the disease are characterized by fever, myalgia, severe malaise, non-productive cough, and sore throats. The disease spreads when an infected individual coughs or sneezes and sends the virus into the air, and other susceptible individuals inhale the virus. The virus is also believed to be transmitted when a person touches a surface that is contaminated with the virus (e.g., door knob, etc.) and then touches the nose or eyes. Infected individuals can transmit the virus almost within a day following infection (i.e. latent period). Although it is generally believed that infected individuals can pass the virus for 3\u20137 days following symptom onset, there is some uncertainty on the duration of the infectious period. The generation time (i.e. sum of latent and infectious periods) for influenza, reported and assumed in the literature, ranges from 3 days [4], [5], [6] to about 6 days [7], [8].",

To appropriately assess the disaster size of a probable future pandemic, we have to quantify the transmission potential (and its associated uncertainty). Although it is difficult to directly measure the transmissibility of a future pandemic, historical epidemiologic data is readily available from previous pandemics, and as a reference quantity for future pandemic planning, mathematical and statistical analyses of the historical data can offer various insights. In particular, because many historical records tend to document only the temporal distribution of cases or deaths (i.e. epidemic curve), we modelers have faced with a difficult need to clarify the mechanisms of the spread of influenza using such time-evolution data alone. In this paper, we review a number of mathematical and statistical methods for the estimation of the transmission potential of pandemic influenza, focusing on theoretical techniques to maximize the utility of the temporal distribution of influenza cases. The methods that have been incorporated in this review include the applications of epidemiologically structured epidemic models, explicitly duration-structured epidemic system, and stochastic processes (i.e. branching and counting processes). Whereas this review does not cover the spread of influenza in space, spatial heterogeneity in transmission and the growing interest in the role of contact networks are briefly discussed as the future challenge.",

Theoretically, R0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case during its entire period of infectiousness in a completely susceptible population [17]. As the epidemic progresses, the number of susceptible individuals is decreased due to infection, and the reproduction number decays following R(t)=R0S(t)/S(0) where S(t) and S(0) are, respectively, the number of susceptible individuals at time t and before the epidemic starts; the latter is equivalent to the total population size N given that all individuals are susceptible before the beginning of an epidemic. Clearly, this definition only applies to (novel) emerging infectious diseases (e.g., the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from 2002\u20132003) or re-emerging infectious diseases that had not circulated in the population in question for long enough to allow for residual immunity in the population to disappear due to births and deaths.",

To achieve R(t)<1, one or a combination of control strategies may be implemented. For example, one of the best known uses of R0 is in determining the critical coverage of immunization required to eradicate a disease in a randomly mixing population. That is, when vaccine is available against a disease in question, it is of interest to estimate the critical proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated (i.e. vaccination coverage) in order to attain R<1\n[18], [19]. For example, in the U.S. prior to 1963, a vaccine against measles was not available and hence recurrent epidemics of measles were observed with approximately 3\u20134 million cases per year and a mean of 450 deaths. The introduction of the vaccine in the U.S. reduced the incidence by 98 percent.",

Depending on the characteristics of data and underlying assumptions of the models, R0 can be estimated using various different approaches [36]. In addition to the final size equation, R0 of an epidemic of newly emerging disease can be estimated from the intrinsic growth rate\n[4], [6], [8], [18], [37], [38], which is also referred to as the rate of natural increase, suggesting the natural growth rate of infected individuals in a fully susceptible population (discussed in Section 4). Moreover, for simple epidemic models with relatively few parameters, R0 can be estimated with other unobservable quantities by rigorous curve fitting of model equations to the observed epidemic data (discussed in Section 3) [38], [39], [40]. Not only R0 but also R(t) can be estimated from the temporal distribution of infectious diseases, reconstructing the transmission network or inferring the time-inhomogeneous number of secondary transmissions [41], [42], [43], [44].",

One would need first to carry out serological surveys to quantify the fraction of the population that is effectively protected against infection (i.e. age- and/or time-specific proportion of those possessing acquired immunity needs to be estimated). Through this effort, the force of infection, the rate at which susceptible individuals get infected, is estimated [45]. For example, this is the case for rubella, mumps and measles (that are still circulating in some regions of the world even when high effective vaccination coverage is achieved). Although the estimation of R0 for endemic diseases is out of the scope of this review, methodological details and the applications to estimate the force of infection and R0 can be found elsewhere [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52].",

The corresponding realization of the cumulative number of influenza notifications is given by Ci(t)=\u2211j=1tCi\u2032(t) where t=1,2,3,\u2026,n. The reproduction number was then estimated from each of 1000 simulated epidemic curves to generate a distribution of R estimates from which simple statistics can be computed including 95% confidence intervals. These statistics need to be interpreted with caution. For example, 95% confidence intervals for R derived from our bootstrap sample of R should be interpreted as containing 95% of future estimates when the same assumptions are made and the only noise source is observation error. It is tempting but incorrect to interpret these confidence intervals as containing the true parameters with probability 0.95.

Whereas Kermack\u2013McKendrick model governed by ODEs (i.e. SIR and SEIR models as discussed above) has been well-known, Kermack and McKendrick had actually proposed an infection-age structured model in their initial publication in 1927 [72], the mathematical importance of which was recognized only after 1970s [83], [84]. Let us denote the numbers of susceptible and recovered individuals by S(t) and U(t). Further, let i(t,\u03c4) be the density of infectious individuals at time t and infection-age \u03c4 (i.e. time since infection). The model is given by(17)dS(t)dt=\u2212\u03bb(t)S(t),(\u2202\u2202t+\u2202\u2202\u03c4)i(t,\u03c4)=\u2212\u03b3(\u03c4)i(t,\u03c4),i(t,0)=\u03bb(t)S(t),dU(t)dt=\u222b0\u221e\u03b3(\u03c4)i(t,\u03c4)d\u03c4, where \u03bb(t) is referred to as the force of infection (foi) (i.e. as discussed in Section 2, foi is defined as the rate at which susceptible individuals get infected) which is given by:(18)\u03bb(t)=\u222b0\u221e\u03b2(\u03c4)i(t,\u03c4)d\u03c4 and \u03b3(\u03c4) is the rate of recovery at infection-age \u03c4. It should be noted that the above model has not taken into account the background host demography (i.e. birth and death). In a closed population, the total population size N is thus given by:(19)N=S(t)+\u222b0\u221ei(t,\u03c4)d\u03c4+U(t). It should also be noted that, although i(t,\u03c4) is referred to as density, it is not meant to be a normalized density (i.e. integral of i(t,\u03c4) over t and \u03c4 does not sum up to 1). Rather, we use density to mathematically refer to the absolute frequency in the infection-age space.",

Moreover, assuming that we observe an exponential growth of incidence during the initial phase (i.e. j(t)=kexp(rt) where k and r are, respectively, a constant (k>0) and the intrinsic growth rate), the following relationship must be met(29)j(t)=j(t\u2212\u03c4)exp(r\u03c4). Replacing j(t\u2212\u03c4) in the right-hand side of (28) by (29), we get(30)j(t)=\u222b0\u221eA(\u03c4)j(t)exp(\u2212r\u03c4)d\u03c4.

Further, we consider a probability density of the generation time (i.e. the time from infection of an individual to the infection of a secondary case by that individual [85]), denoted by w(\u03c4):(32)w(\u03c4):=A(\u03c4)\u222b0\u221eA(x)dx=A(\u03c4)R0.

(29), (30), (31), (32), (33) are what Wallinga and Lipsitch discussed in a recent study [6], reasonably suggesting the relationship between the generation time and R0. Accordingly, the estimator of R0 using the intrinsic growth rate is given by:(34)R0\u02c6=1M(\u2212r), where M(\u2212r) is the moment generating function of the generation time distribution w(\u03c4), given the intrinsic growth rate r\n[6].2\nEq. (34) significantly improved the issue of estimating R0 using the intrinsic growth rate alone, because (34) permits validating estimates of R0 by various different distributional assumptions for w(\u03c4). The issue of assuming explicit distributions for latent and infectious periods has been highlighted in recent studies [86], [87], [88], [89], [90] and indeed, this point is in part addressed by (34), because the convolution of latent and infectious periods yields w(\u03c4). Moreover, since the assumed lengths of generation time most likely yielded different estimates of R0 for Spanish influenza by different studies [60], Eq. (34) highlights a critical need to clarify the generation time distribution using observed data.",

Since the non-linear phase is difficult to analyze, our interest to estimate R0 with this dataset is limited to the initial growth phase only (right panel in Fig. 3). Even though the data represent deaths over time (i.e. not infection events with time), we can directly extract the same intrinsic growth rate as practised with onset data, assuming that death data are a good proxy for morbidity data (see our discussions in Section 6). Assuming exponential growth in deaths as shown in (29), the intrinsic growth rate r is estimated to be 0.16 per day. Supposing that w(\u03c4) is arbitrarily assumed to follow a gamma distribution with mean G and coefficient of variation, CV=Var(G)/G, R0 is given by(35)R0=(1+rG(CV)2)1(CV)2. Although there is no concensus regarding the generation time of Spanish influenza, we assume it ranges from 2\u20135 days. Assuming further that CV=0.5, R0 is estimated to range from 1.36 (for G=2 day) to 2.07 (for G=5 days).",

Under this assumption, A(t,\u03c4) is rewritten as the product of two functions \u03d51(t) and \u03d52(\u03c4):(40)A(t,\u03c4)=\u03d51(t)\u03d52(\u03c4).

Another function \u03d52(\u03c4) represents the density of infection events as a function of infection-age \u03c4. Accordingly, we can immediately see that \u03d52(\u03c4) is exactly the same as w(\u03c4), the generation time distribution. That is, the above arguments suggest that A(t,\u03c4) (i.e. the rate at which an infectious individual at calendar time t and infection-age \u03c4 produces secondary transmission) is decomposed as:(43)A(t,\u03c4)=R(t)w(\u03c4).

However, it should be noted that the study in SARS implicitly assumed that onset data c(t) at time t reflects the above discussed infection event j(t). That is, supposing that we observed ci onset cases reported between ti and ti+1, R(t) was calculated as(46)R\u02c6(ti)=ci\u2211j=0nci\u2212jsj, where sj is the discretized serial interval which is defined as the time from onset of a primary case to onset of the secondary cases [94], [95].

It is impossible to avoid using the probability generating function (pgf) to discuss the branching process. The above described \u03c1i(n) characterize positive and discrete number of secondary transmissions, and thus, is a non-zero discrete random variable. The pgf of \u03c1, g\u03c1(s) is given by(51)g\u03c1(s)=E(s\u03c1)=\u2211k=0\u221epksk. There are two basic properties concerning g(s) in relation to the epidemic process. First, R0 is by definition the mean value of secondary transmissions (Eq. (50)) and, thus given by g\u2032(1). Second, the probability that an infected individual does not cause any secondary transmissions p0=Pr(\u03c1=0) is given by g(0), which is useful for discussing threshold phenomena and extinction [101]. If we note that C0=1 (i.e. only one index case), the Galton\u2013Watson process has the following pgf identity:(52)g0(s)=s,gn+1(s)=gn(g(s))=g(gn(s)). Even when there are C0=a cases in generation 0 (where a>1), we just have to assume that there are a different independent infection-trees and thus(53)gC0(s)=sa,gCn(s)=(gn(s))a. From the above discussions, the expected number of cases in generation n, Mn, and the variance Vn is(54)Mn=R0nM0,Vn={nVar(\u03c1)(R0=1),R0n\u22121Var(\u03c1)R0n\u22121R0\u22121(R0\u22601). The process grows geometrically if R0>1, stays constant if R0=1, and decays geometrically if R0<1. These three cases are referred to as supercritical, critical, and subcritical, respectively. However, unlike the deterministic model, it should be remembered that critical process does not permit continued transmissions, and rather, the process becomes extinct almost surely (i.e. probability of extinction given R0=1 is one) [101].",

            "text": "It should be noted that the discrete-time branching process assumes a homogeneous pattern of spread. A technical issue has arisen on this subject during the SARS outbreak. Usually, we observe some cases who produce an extraordinary number of secondary cases compared with other infected individuals, which are referred to as superspreaders. Because of this, observed offspring distributions for directly transmitted diseases tend to be extremely skewed to the right. Empirically, it has been suggested that Poisson offspring distribution is sometimes insufficient to highlight the presence of superspreaders in epidemic modeling [107]. For example, if non-zero discrete distribution of secondary cases follows a geometric distribution with mean R0, the pgf is given by a geometric distribution with mean R0:(59)g(s)=11+R0(1\u2212s). Moreover, if the offspring distribution follows gamma distribution with mean R0 and dispersion parameter k, the pgf g(s) follows negative binomial distribution [108]:(60)g(s)=(1+Rk(1\u2212s))\u2212k. We still do not know if pandemic influenza is also the case to warrant the skewed offspring distributions. To explicitly test if superspreading events frequently exist in influenza transmission, it is necessary to accumulate contact tracing data for this difficult disease, the cases of which often show flu-like symptoms only (as discussed in Section 1). In addition, it should be noted that we cannot attribute the skewed offspring distribution to the underlying contact network only. To date, there are two major reasons which can generate superspreaders: (i) those who experience very frequent contacts (social superspreader) or (ii) those who are suffering from high pathogen loads or those who can scatter the pathogen through the air such as the use of nebulizer in hospitals (biological superspreader). From the offspring distribution only, we cannot distinguish these two mechanisms.",

            "text": "With regard to the estimation of R0 using final size, we briefly discuss another method based on a stochastic process. As we discussed above, let S(t), I(t) and U(t) be the numbers of susceptible, infectious and recovered individuals at time t, respectively. Further, let \u03b2 and 1/\u03b3 denote the transmission rate and the mean duration of the infectious period, respectively. Supposing that K(t), the number of individuals who experienced infection between time 0 and time t, is given by K(t)=S(0)\u2212S(t), the two processes K(t) and U(t) are increasing counting processes where the general epidemic is explained by:(61)Pr(dK(t)=1,dU(t)=0|Zt)=\u03b2S\u00af(t)I(t)dt,Pr(dK(t)=0,dU(t)=1|Zt)=\u03b3I(t)dt,Pr(dK(t)=0,dU(t)=0|Zt)=1\u2212\u03b2S\u00af(t)I(t)dt\u2212\u03b3I(t)dt, where Zt denotes the \u03c3-algebra generated by the history of the epidemic {S(u),I(u);0<u<t} and S\u00af(t)=S(t)/n (where n is the size of the susceptible population at time 0). The latter is equivalent to assuming density-independent transmission (i.e. also referred to as true mass action or frequency dependent assumption [109]). Based on Eq. (61), two zero-mean martingales [110] are defined by:(62)M1(t)=K(t)\u2212\u222b0t\u03b2S\u00af(u)I(u)du,M2(t)=U(t)\u2212\u222b0t\u03b3I(u)du. From the martingale theory [111], a zero-mean martingale is given by(63)M(t)=\u222b0t1S\u00af(u)dM1(u)\u2212\u03b2\u03b3M2(t)=nS(0)+nS(0)\u22121+\u22ef+nS(t)+1\u2212\u03b2\u03b3U(t). Thus, the estimator \u03b8\u02c6=\u03b2\u02c6/\u03b3\u02c6 is given by(64)\u03b8\u02c6=[nS(0)+nS(0)\u22121+\u22ef+nS(T)+1]U(T)=\u2212ln(1\u2212p\u02dc)U(T), where p\u02dc is the observed final size (=1\u2212S(T)/n) at the end of the epidemic at time T. Furthermore, the variance of the zero-martingale is given by(65)Var(M(t))=Var(M1(t))+\u03b82Var(M2(t)). From the martingale central limit theorem [112], the estimator \u03b8 is approximately normally distributed in a major outbreak in a large community. The standard error is then consistently estimated by:(66)s.e.(\u03b8\u02c6)=[nS(0)2+n(S(0)\u22121)2+\u22ef+n(S(T)+1)2\u2212\u03b8\u02c62R(T)]12U(T)=[nS(0)+12+nS(0)+12\u2212\u03b8\u02c62R(T)]12U(T). Consequently, the estimator and standard error of R0 are given by:(67)R0\u02c6=n\u00d7\u03b8\u02c6,s.e.(R0\u02c6)=n\u00d7s.e.(\u03b8\u02c6).

It should be noted that Eq. (74) ignores secondary transmissions before onset of illness. As we discussed above, c(t) is given by j(t) and the incubation period distribution f(\u03c4),(75)c(t)=\u222b0\u221ej(t\u2212\u03c4)f(\u03c4)d\u03c4.

Eq. (80) is difficult to solve as it includes S(t\u2212\u03c4) in the right-hand side.

Since a simple model assuming homogeneous mixing did not reflect the patterns of gonorrhea transmission in the United States, Hethcote and Yorke divided the population in question into two; those who are sexually very active and not, the former of which was referred to as core group. Compared with the temporal distribution of infection given by a model with homogeneous mixing assumption, the simple heterogeneous model with a core group revealed much quicker increase in epidemic size, showing rather different trajectory of an epidemic. Given that the variance of sexual partnership is extremely large (i.e. if the distribution of the frequency of sexual intercourse is extremely skewed to the right with a very long right tail), the estimate of R0 is shown to become considerably high. The finding supports a vulnerability of our society to the invasion of sexually transmitted diseases.

However, it should be noted that the pattern of contact does not necessarily follow scale-free for all directly transmitted diseases. Indeed, there is no empirical evidence which suggests that the contact structure of any droplet infections follows the power law (i.e. we do not know if the above described contact heterogeneity is the case for diseases except for sexually transmitted diseases). A typical example of confusion is seen in the superspreading events during the 2002/03 SARS epidemics [158], where we cannot explicitly attribute the phenomena either to contact network or biological factors (as long as contact and infection event are not directly observable). We still do not know how we should account for the distribution P(k) for influenza and other viral respiratory diseases (i.e. power law or not) which remains to be clarified for each disease in future research.",
