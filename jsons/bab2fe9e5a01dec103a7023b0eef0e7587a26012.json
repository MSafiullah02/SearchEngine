Meta-analysis with random-effects model revealed that there were no statistically significant differences in preventing respiratory infection using N95 respirators and surgical masks in hospitals (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.42-1.29, P > .05) (Figure 6). However, the sensitivity analysis after excluding the trial by Radonovich et al 12 showed a significant effect of N95 respirators on preventing respiratory infection (RR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.35-0.82, P < .05). Five RCTs involving 8444 participants reported influenza like illness. 12,18-21 Meta-analysis with random-effects model revealed that there were no statistically significant differences in preventing influenza like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.33-1.14, P > .05) (Figure 7). The results of subgroup analyses indicated that statistically significant superiority of N95 respirators over surgical masks against influenza like illness (RR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.71, P < .05) in the community (only one RCT). The sensitivity analysis showed results remained unchanged after excluding each trial.",
