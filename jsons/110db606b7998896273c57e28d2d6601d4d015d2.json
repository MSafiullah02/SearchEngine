This was expected because treatment did not impact ECM yields or DMI. Beauchemin et al. (1999) and Boyd et al. (2011) found no effect of DFM supplementation on milk efficiency as well. In contrast, Schingoethe et al. (2004) did find a 7% increase in milk efficiency with yeast supplementation. In addition, Holtshausen et al. (2011) found that cows in early lactation fed an enzyme product had greater milk production efficiency than those fed the control. However, in the study by Holtshausen et al. (2011) , the enzyme product contained mainly xylanase and endoglucanase activity, whereas the enzyme product used in present study primarily contained amylase and cellulase activity. In this study, there was no impact of treatment on milk components, with the exception of SCS. Our data concur with those of other researchers regarding milk components. Dann et al. (2000) found no impact of DFM on the concentrations of fat, protein, lactose, total solids and MUN, which agree with our results. Moallem et al. (2009) found no impact on milk fat and protein concentrations between cattle supplemented with DFM or without DFM. Nocek and Kautz (2006) found no impact of DFM supplementation on milk fat and protein yields, as well as milk protein concentration. A similar response has been observed for enzyme supplementation (Reddish & Kung, 2007 ). Oetzel et al. (2007 found that DFM supplementation only increased milk fat concentration for cows in their first lactation. Dann et al. (2000) did not find any impact of DFM supplementation on SCC. However, SCS was reduced in the milk of cows when the enzymes were fed in combination with the DFM alone, but similar to control cows. These data suggest that adding cellulase and amylase to the diet of a cow fed DFM reduces SCS. However, Reddish and Kung (2007) reported no impact of enzyme supplementation containing cellulase and xylanase activity on SCC. As a result, it can be concluded that there is some other underlying factor contributing to the differences between treatments and further research would need to be performed to determine these discrepancies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 123, "end": 147, "text": "Beauchemin et al.
