Kawasaki disease is rare in infants !3 months old, which suggests the possibility that they are protected from infection by antibodies that are passively acquired from the mother. Likewise, widespread immunity to a common infectious agent may explain the rarity of Kawasaki disease in adults. A history of an antecedent respiratory illness before the onset of Kawasaki disease has been reported [5] . Although many infectious agents have been proposed as the cause of Kawasaki disease, none have been consistently associated with the disease.

Before the emergence of CoV-SARS, HCoVs were generally thought to cause mild, self-limited infections of the upper respiratory tract. The study of HCoVs has been hampered by the difficulty in propagating these viruses in vitro [9] . To determine whether previously unknown HCoVs are circulating in the human population, we developed genetic probes that target regions of the replicase 1a gene that are conserved among HCoVs, avian CoVs, and mammalian CoVs. The screening of stored specimens of respiratory tract secretions from children !5 years old revealed evidence of a novel HCoV, designated \"New Haven coronavirus\" (HCoV-NH) [10] . On the basis of sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the replicase 1a gene, HCoV-NH is closely related to an HCoV recently identified in The Netherlands [11, 12] . One child in our study, a 6-monthold infant who had 2 respiratory specimens test positive for HCoV-NH, was diagnosed with Kawasaki disease. To further investigate the possible association between HCoV-NH infection and Kawasaki disease, we expanded the time frame to the entire period during which we had obtained specimens, and we conducted a case-control study to assess this association.",

However, these studies either lacked control subjects or were poorly controlled, and an association between any of these pathogens and Kawasaki disease has not been established. One of the most promising leads in the investigation of the cause of Kawasaki disease is the detection, recently reported by Rowley et al. [6] , of an antigen of unknown origin in respiratory epithelial cells and macrophages from children with acute Kawasaki disease. This finding suggests that a respiratory pathogen may be associated with Kawasaki disease.

The percentage of HCoV-NH-positive control subjects (4.5%) was similar to our previous finding [10] . The selection of control subjects from children with suspected respiratory tract infection would tend to bias the results toward there being no association between HCoV-NH infection and Kawasaki disease-control subjects would more likely be infected with HCoV-NH than would children without symptoms of respiratory tract infection. If this potential bias affected the present study, then the true association would be stronger than we have already shown. The difference in the age distribution between the case subjects and the control subjects was small (mean difference, !1 month), and so it is extremely unlikely that this factor accounted for the difference between the proportions of case and control subjects infected with HCoV-NH. False-positive results that are caused by PCR contamination are a concern in any study that uses genomic amplification techniques. To address this issue, appropriate negative controls were included in each set of RT-PCR amplifications, and we required that 2 regions of the HCoV-NH genome be amplified for the specimen to be considered positive. Moreover, for the observed association to have been caused by contamination, it would have been necessary that the specimens from the case subjects were preferentially contaminated-a highly improbable scenario. Each amplicon was sequenced, to confirm the presence of HCoV-NH. Distinct genetic polymorphisms were observed in the HCoV-NH sequences identified in the isolates from the case subjects. This further reduces the likelihood that PCR contamination explains our findings.",
