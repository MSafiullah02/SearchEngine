Betacoronavirus genus is divided into the four clades A to D. Coronaviruses infect a wide range of avian or mammalian species, and are responsible for enteric or respiratory infections (Woo et al., 2009). Interest in coronaviruses increased by the emergence of two human coronaviruses, Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2002 and 2012, respectively. Both these coronaviruses belong to the Betacoronavirus genus, clades B and C, respectively, and cause severe respiratory diseases in humans. SARS-CoV emerged in human in 2002\u20132003, causing an outbreak with more than 8000 cases with a fatality rate of nearly 10% (Peiris et al., 2004). MERS-CoV emerged in 2012 in the Middle-East (Zaki et al., 2012). To date, 1413 laboratory cases of MERS-CoV infection have been confirmed, including 502 fatal cases, reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Institut National de Veille Sanitaire (INVS), 2015). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have a zoonotic origin, with an animal reservoir in close contact with the human population. The zoonotic potential of coronaviruses implies the need for surveillance of coronaviruses associated with domestic animals in close contact with human population.",

This clade also contains other closely related coronaviruses known as Bovine-like coronavirus (BCoV-like), originating from captive wild ruminants such as waterbuck (Kobus ellypsiprimus), sambar deer (Cervus unicolor), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), elk (Cervus elephus), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), and sable antelope (Hipotragus niger) (Alekseev et al., 2008). These coronaviruses were antigenically, biologically, and genetically highly related to BCoV (Alekseev et al., 2008, Tsunemitsu et al., 1995, Majhdi et al., 1997, Hasoksuz et al., 2008). BCoVs-like were also detected from camelids such as alpaca (Vicugna pacos), llama (Lama glama), and dromedary camel (Camelius dromedarius). Particularly, a BCoV-like, named Dromedary camel coronavirus (DcCoV), was detected from dromedary camel feces in the United Arab Emirates in 2013, during an epidemiological investigation aiming to identify the animal reservoir of MERS-CoV (Cebra et al., 2003, Woo et al., 2014). BCoVs-like are globally responsible for enteric infection. However, in 2002 a BCoV-like responsible for respiratory infection was detected from a dog in United Kingdom (Erles et al., 2003). To date, only 15 complete genomes of BCoVs, including 13 from USA, one from Canada, and one from South Korea are available on GenBank. Moreover, 16 BCoVs-like complete genomes, including 12 from captive ruminants, one from a dog, and three from dromedary camels are available on GenBank (consulted on September 8th 2015). Much earlier, in 1988, a coronavirus closely related to BCoV was isolated from the feces of a diarrheic child in Germany. This coronavirus, tentatively named at first Human enteric coronavirus (HEC 4408), revealed itself to be closer to BCoVs than to BCoV-Like and to other HCoVs indeed. The phylogenetic position of this virus and the context of this case suggests the infection of the child by a cattle virus, consequently to a species barrier-crossing (Zhang et al., 1994).",

More precisely, BCoV and HCoV-OC43 share a global nucleotide identity of 96%. The genetic comparison of BCoV and HCoV-OC43 reveals that HCoV-OC43 results from a zoonotic transmission from bovine to human. Using a molecular clock analysis, Vijgen et al. estimated the tMRCA of these viruses around 1890 (Vijgen et al., 2005). The intraspecific variability of the HCoV-OC43 revealed the co-circulation of numerous recombinant variants (Kin et al., 2015). Given the similarity of HCoV-OC43 with BCoV, we were interested in testing the genetic variability of BCoV using the same methods. Thus, the objective of the current study was to investigate the intraspecific genetic variability of BCoV collected in Normandy from 2003 to 2014 and to test whether recombination remain a major mechanism of variability in BCoVs as seen for his sister clade HCoV-OC43.",

Two clusters, one grouping BCoVs and BCoVs-like and the other one containing HCoV-OC43s, are observed in the nsp12 and N trees. DcCoVs differentiates as a potential third cluster on the S tree. The BCoV cluster of the nsp12, S, and N maximum likelihood trees is divided into three sub-clusters. These sub-clusters are globally comprised of by the same molecular isolates for nsp12, S, and N trees. Nsp12, S, and N produced comparable tree topologies and therefore a globally congruent phylogenetic signal that does not suggest BCoV recombination events, contrary to HCoV-OC43 during the same period and in the same geographic area (Kin et al., 2015). The positions of BCoV and BCoV-like sequences on each tree are summarized in Table S2 (supplementary material). According to nsp12, S, and N trees, one sub-cluster named C1 contains BCoVs and BCoVs-like from the USA, constituting the genotype C1C1C1. A second sub-cluster, named C2, groups on each trees all the BCoV sequences generated in this study defining the genotype C2C2C2. Finally, the last sub-cluster, named C3, contains the prototype strains Kakegawa, Mebus, Quebec, and CrCoV on all trees, constituting the genotypes C3C3C3. Two exceptions are observed. First, the three DcCoVs are included on sub-cluster C2 on nsp12 and N tree, but are grouped in a potential outlier position from BCoV and HCoV-OC43 clusters, constituting a genotype named C2COUTLIERC2. The second exception is the HEC 4408 that is located on sub-cluster C3 on nsp12 and N trees, and in sub-clusters C2 on S tree, constituting the genotype C3C2C3. This analysis reveals a potential geographical distribution with a segregation of BCoV and BCoV-like sequences from US on one hand, and BCoV from France in another hand. An additional S tree, depicted in Fig. S4 (supplementary material), includes additional BCoV and BCoV-like sequences from the USA, Brazil, South Korea, China, Sweden, Denmark, and Italy. The topology of this additional S tree is concordant with the S tree presented in Fig. 2. The same tree clusters (BCoV and BCoV-like, HCoV-OC43, and DcCoV) were observed. In the same way, the three sub-clusters C1, C2, and C3 were observed inside to the BCoV cluster. The additional sequences include in this most detailed S tree allowed us to deeply characterize the geographic distribution of BCoV and BCoV-like. Indeed, in addition to USA sequences, the sub-cluser C1 contains BCoVs and BCoVs-like from both America and Asia continent, more precisely from China, South Korea, and Brazil. The sub-cluster C2 contains in addition to the 14 French BCoVs, 35 additional BCoVs from other European countries such as Sweden, Denmark, and Italy (cf. Tables S2 and S3 in supplementary material).",

            "text": "The world population of cattle is estimated at 1.43 billion (Robinson et al., 2014). In France, the cattle population extends to around 19 million among which 1.9 million constitute the livestock of Lower Normandy, where the present study emerges from. BCoV infections are not listed as \u201cmonitored transmittable veterinary infections\u201d. Therefore, no public data measuring the impact of this infection on livestock cattle, national or international, are available despite BCoV being an ubiquitous virus. Partial genomic sequences available in GenBank come from 17 countries, unequally distributed on five continents. Fifteen complete BCoV genomes from North America and South Korea (14 and 1, respectively) are currently available (according to GenBank, consulted on September 8th, 2015) but no BCoV sequence from France was available before the present study. Among the few available epidemiological studies, Beaudeau et al. showed that in Sweden, the seroprevalence of BCoV is ranging from 43 to 65% in cattle less than12 months, and observed a winter circulation in the temperate zones of the Northern hemisphere (Beaudeau et al., 2010). This epidemiology shares common characteristics with that of the HCoV-OC43 infection in humans, namely a primary infection in young patients in winter. BCoV and HCoV-OC43 belong to the clade A of Betacoronavirus genus sharing a global similarity of 96% on a nucleotide level. The divergence between HCoV-OC43 and BCoV is estimated at the end of the 19th century, thus contemporary with a species barrier crossing from cattle to humans. Six different genotypes have been identified in France among the 15 HCoV-OC43 circulating strains (including numerous recombinant variants) in respiratory samples taken over a 13-year period (Kin et al., 2015). This evolutive pattern (deeply affected by recombination) has been commonly described for other coronaviruses (Infection bronchitis virus, Feline coronavirus, Canine coronavirus) and proves, in these contexts, to be a factor that favors the potential emergence of new variants (Cavanagh et al., 1992, Herrewegh et al., 1998, Decaro et al., 2009b). There is no published data for the potential localization of recombination hot spot(s) on the BCoV genome. Given the genetic relatedness between HCoV-OC43 and BCoV, we propose the hypothesis that these potential hot spots could be located in the same regions for these two viruses. Extensive sequencing of complete BCoV genomes would ascertain the existence of these hot spots, but was not performed in this study.",

Indeed, all of the BCoVs in our study are of non-recombinant genotype C2C2C2 (see Table 2\n). All of the sequences of the 24 BCoVs and BCoVs-like coming from the US and included in the phylogenetic analysis are of a non-recombinant C1C1C1 genotype. In the same way, the sequences of three BCoV prototypes and the CrCoV included in the study are of a non-recombinant C3C3C3 genotype. Within this analysis of putative recombinant detection, only the coronavirus strain HEC 4408 shows a recombinant genotype of type C3C2C3. It is worthwhile to highlight that the HEC 4408 finds his root among the French isolates of BCoV (Fig. 2) and thus represents an independent sub-group within the BCoV cluster. The HEC 4408, serologically distinct from HCoV-OC43, illustrates the capacity of BCoV for spill-over independently of its role in the emergence of HCoV-OC43.",

Given that these two viruses are extremely close with respect to genetic and epidemiological characteristics, this difference could be linked to different environmental constraints (sensu-lato). In this light, one may conceive of a lesser genetic diversity of the animal host (animal livestock versus human) resulting from domestication and breeding practices by human, and a lesser geographic mobility of animals, thereby weakening the BCoV diversifying selection process and decreasing potential co-infection and thus recombination events. These hypotheses must however be tested on a greater viral genetic dataset.",

In the cluster of BCoV and BCoV-like strains, a geographic distribution may be noted, having a so-called European sub-cluster and a so-called America-Asia sub-cluster. This distribution suggests that the divergence of the two sub-clusters of BCoVs is a relatively recent phenomenon with regards to the history of livestock cattle. Indeed, the Bos taurus taurus livestock cattle of the Old World (Europe, Asia, and Africa) are issued from the domestication facilities of the aurochs, a wild species living exclusively in the Old World. This domestication event occurred around 10,000 years ago. Livestock cattle arrived on the North and South American continent after the discovery of the New World in the XIth century (Bollongino et al., 2012, Loftus et al., 1994). The distinction of genetic clusters corresponding to the BCoV of different geographic origins could be attributed to the diffusion of strains favoring the exchange of animals incurred by international commerce. In Europe, France is the largest producer and exporter of cattle. Moreover, France exports live cattle for reproduction to Italy, Spain, Greece, and Germany, and also to Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. The import\u2013export of fresh and frozen beef between the US and the European Union has been minimal, especially after 1998 at which point the EU appealed to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to prohibit the import of beef for purposes of food safety. The final decision of the WTO was favorable to the European Union, but was not handed down until 2007. However, between 1998 and 2007, commerce between US and EU was greatly weakened.",
