            "text": "Supplementary Note 1. Assessment of selec5on on other variants in the IFNL locus A classical problem in popula0on gene0cs is the iden0fica0on of the par0cular gene0c variant responsible for selec0on signals. The rs368234815 TT allele has a strong phenotypic effect by trunca0ng IFNL4, but we cannot per se rule out that another allele on the TT haplotype drives the selec0ve signature. As Figure 3a --c and Supplementary Figure 2 show there are other variants with comparable F ST or XP--EHH values. The two variants ini0ally described as being associated with HCV clearance are rs12979860 [1,2] and rs8099917 [3] . Both variants show weaker combined selec0on signals than the TT allele (Supplementary Fig. 2) . This is in line with the unclear func0onal effects of these variants [4--8] and their weaker associa0on with HCV clearance compared to rs368234815 in several popula0ons [9--11]. Thus, rs12979860 and rs8099917 are much weaker candidates to be the target of natural selec0on.",

            "text": "Only one variant (rs8109886, A>C, 19:39742762), which is intergenic and located 3.3Kb upstream of IFNL4, also showed the combined signatures of posi0ve selec0on (XP--EHH and iHS) and high popula0on differen0a0on (Table X1, Supplementary Fig. 2 ). While the rs368234815 TT allele has a very clear func0onal consequence, no func0onal effect has been described for rs8109886. Selec0on can act only on variants with func0onal and phenotypic consequences, making a priori the TT allele a much more reasonable candidate for selec0on. S0ll, to tease apart the signatures of the two variants, we analyzed the frequencies of the four possible allele configura0ons (haplotypes) of both variants ( Figure X1 ). The Figure X1 shows that the derived C allele of rs8109886 resides almost exclusively on the TT haplotype (a single \u0394G--C haplotype in LWK is likely the result of recombina0on), sugges0ng the derived C allele appeared in the TT background. Figure X1 also shows a change of rs8109886 allele frequencies on the TT background: while both rs8109886 alleles are equally frequent in Africa, TT--C haplotype has a higher frequency than TT--A haplotype in all other popula0ons. To determine whether this observa0on is compa0ble with a model of selec0on on TT alone we used simula0ons with the parameters for the SDN model inferred in the ABC approach (see Methods, SI Note 3, Table 3 ). Given the frequencies measured for TT in Africa and Asia, and for C in Africa, we obtained a probability of 23.8% for the C variant to reach similar or higher frequency in Asia than that we observed. Thus, the skewed paeern of the TT--C haplotype in Asia, and the higher F ST for C, are not unexpected by selec0on on TT alone. While we cannot completely discard the possibility that C alone has been under posi0ve selec0on, and IFNL4 disrup0on by TT is a byproduct of selec0on on this linked variant, this is a very unlikely scenario because: (1) No func0on has been observed for rs8109886 despite being extensively scru0nized due to the associa0on of this genomic region with HCV clearance; (2) the TT variant has a clear and important func0onal consequence; (3) TT has in addi0on a very strong signature of posi0ve selec0on; and (4) selec0on favors an allele that shows an advantage against specific viral infec0ons. In any case, several lines of evidence indicate that the high frequency of IFN--\u03bb4 pseudogeniza0on through disrup0on by the TT allele is the consequence of posi0ve selec0on in East Asia. Another variant, rs4803217 (within IFNL3 3'UTR), was recently shown to be func0onal and thus suggested to contribute to the HCV associa0on in this region [12] . However, this variant shows weaker selec0on signals than rs368234815, most notably in European popula0ons where LD between these variants is less strong than in Asians, and in African popula0ons, where these variants are only in moderate LD (r 2 = 0.62, Table 2 , Fig. S2 ). There is moderate LD between IFNL4 and IFNL3, with an average r 2 between rs368234815 and SNPs in IFNL3 of 0.18 in CEU and of 0.44 in CHS (see also Fig. S7) . So, the selec0on signatures in IFNL3 and IFNL4 may not be independent. In fact, the four IFNL3 SNPs (rs11881222, rs12979860, rs8109886, rs8099917) iden0fied by Manry et al. [13] are in high LD with rs368234815 but have (1) unclear func0onal effects, (2) weaker associa0on with HCV clearance than the TT allele at least in Africa, and, importantly, (3) weaker signatures of selec0on ( Table 2) . Thus, the signatures for these variants are most likely driven by linkage with rs368234815, which is under posi0ve selec0on (Fig. S2, Table 2 ). Some interes0ng variants (rs8103142, rs28416813) which also have high derived allele frequencies (DAF) in CHS and signatures of selec0on show moderate LD with rs368234815 ( Table 2) . S0ll, the signatures for these variants are most likely not independent from rs368234815 because LD is reduced by recombina0on events that likely affect the ancestral haplotype. Of the 47 individuals homozygous for the TT allele in CHS, all are also homozygous for the derived allele of rs8103142, and 46 are also homozygous for the derived allele of rs28416813. Taken together, these lines of evidence confirm that IFNL1/2 and IFNL3/IFNL4 have likely been independently targeted by posi0ve selec0on in recent human history, as suggested by Manry et al. [13] , and highlight that the TT allele of rs368234815 is the most likely selected allele in this region. ",
