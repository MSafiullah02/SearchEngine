            "text": "Genetically susceptible connective tissue diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have viruses that include coronavirus as triggers that lead to its onset. The mechanisms postulated for this are either posttranslational modification of peptides, \"molecular mimicry\" activating T cells or \"epitope spreading,\" due to direct or T-cell associated damage by the virus leading to autoreactive T cells. 1 Currently, patients on disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, biologics, or other immunosuppressive medications are required to consult their rheumatologist and stop these drugs during an infection. 4 Noninfected patients are, however, advised to continue their medication during the epidemic. It is also noteworthy to mention that patients with rheumatic disease are more susceptible to the COVID-19 virus either because of the rheumatologic disease itself or the medications used to treat their underlying disease.",
