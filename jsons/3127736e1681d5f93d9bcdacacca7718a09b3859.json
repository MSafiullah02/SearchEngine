Stimulation through the interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) receptor primarily follows the JAK/STAT pathway, but interplay between cytokine signaling and type I interferons regulates a large number of genes involved in viral immunity. Of particular interest are genes involved in the processing and presentation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I and II pathways. LMP2/7 proteasomal subunits replace normally expressed beta subunits. This assembled immunoproteosome preferentially cleaves peptides for Class I presentation. Also required are Transporters 1/2 (TAP1/2) that translocate peptides into the ER for assembly with Class I and \u00df2-microglobulin. IFN\u03b3 can also induce the primary transactivator controlling Class II gene expression, CIITA. In addition to direct antiviral effects, IFN\u03b3 is crucial for antigen presentation by glial cells and engagement of T-cell effector function.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The JHMV variant v2.2-1 is a neurotropic MHV that infects microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendroglia. Despite elimination of detectable infectious particles, virus persists in the CNS in the form of viral RNA. Clinical symptoms progress from limited mobility to paralysis during a time frame of 6-10 days postinfection. Primary demyelination occurs most prominently 10-21 days postinfection, but continues throughout persistence. 1 CD8 T cells play a critical role in clearing JHMV from the CNS using perforin and IFN\u03b3-mediated mechanisms. Perforin mediated cytolytic activity by virus specific CD8 T cells is effective in clearing virus from astrocytes and microglia, but is insufficient for clearing virus from oligodendroglia. 2, 3 mice exhibit a more severe disease course and a strong association of viral antigen in oligodendroglia. 3 Infected SCID mice receiving CD8 T cells from immunized wt, perforin knock-out (PKO) or GKO mice support the strict reliance on IFN\u03b3 for viral clearance from oligodendroglia. 4 IFN\u03b3 also induces Class II and enhances Class I surface expression on microglia, coincident with maximal T-cell infiltration during infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 730, "end": 732, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 733, "end": 734, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 839, "end": 840, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1017, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "In the normal CNS glial cells express few, if any MHC molecules.

The results indicate that both Class I mRNA and mRNA for genes encoding antigen processing machinery (APM) increased shortly after infection in both cell types, prior to surface Class I expression. However, in contrast to microglia, oligodendroglia appear deficient in Class II presentation. Glial cells thus have similar capacity to regulate Class I APM as other somatic cells.

Real-time PCR analysis indicated that both Class I mRNA and mRNA for genes encoding APM increased shortly after infection, prior to surface Class I expression ( Table 2 ).

Both oligodendroglia and microglia upregulated major components for Class I antigen processing and presentation during infection, supporting the capacity for efficient presentation of virus peptide to CD8 T-cells. Although basal levels of Class I and APM mRNA were lower in oligodendroglia, they increased with similar kinetics in both cell types following infection. Higher relative Class I and APM mRNA levels in oligodendroglia, coincident with peak T-cell infiltration at day 7 p.i., suggests enhanced responsiveness to IFN\u03b3 compared with microglia. Delayed Class I surface expression on oligodendroglia, compared with microglia, appears to reflect levels of IFN inducible APM mRNA. The paucity in CIITA and Class II expression in oligodendroglia remains unknown. Lastly, upregulation of IRF-1 in both cell types during infection was supported by concordant downregulation of IRF-2, an IRF-1 antagonist. In summary, expression of Class I on oligodendroglia during infection, albeit under more stringent regulation compared with microglia, supports oligodendroglia as potential targets for CTL and subsequent pathology. However the CNS employs many protective measures against such activity, particularly to protect cells that proliferate slowly. 5 The demonstration that CTL activity does not control JHMV infection in oligodendroglia, in light of Class I expression, demands further investigation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1375, "end": 1376, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health grant NS18146.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "MHV infection in the CNS: mechanisms of immune-mediated control", "authors": [{"first": "N", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Marten", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Stohlman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Bergmann", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2001, "venue": "Viral Immun", "volume": "14", "issn": "", "pages": "1--18", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Antibody prevents virus reactivation within the central nervous system", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["T"], "last": "Lin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Hinton", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Marten", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Bergmann", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Stohlman", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1999, "venue": "J.
