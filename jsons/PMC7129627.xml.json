It is now firmly established that novel value\u2010added products can be derived from milk and milk products with nutritional and biotechnological interventions. While until recently, breeding policies have aimed at producing more milk, attempts are now directed toward enhancing the value of milk and studying its health implications. This has found more support with clinically established epidemiological linkages between diet and chronic diseases that encourage search for new links between food and disease.",

Milk composition can be altered by nutritional management or through the manipulation of naturally occurring genetic variation among cattle. The possible channels of influencing milk composition to suit specific needs can be investigated with the help of a thorough comprehension of the biochemistry, genetic traits, and factors in the animal diet that affect milk synthesis and composition. By an intelligent combination of the two approaches\u2014nutritional and genetic\u2014a milk designed to suit consumer preferences can be developed. This \u201cdesigner milk\u201d may be rich in specific milk components that may have influence on well\u2010being or on processing. This chapter examines the potential that exists in altering milk composition by nutritional and genetic approaches in order to achieve specific health benefits and/or processing opportunities.",

Altering the composition of milk in a manner that suits health and processing needs forms the basis of the current research interests in the area. For example, a greater proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in milk fat, reduced lactose content in milk for lactose\u2010intolerant people, and/or milk free from \u03b2\u2010lactoglobulin (\u03b2\u2010LG) would benefit human diet and health. From a technological point of view, there exist vast opportunities in altering the primary structure of casein to improve the technological properties of milk and producing milk high in protein content. Engineering milk that clots in less time leads to increased yield and/or more protein recovery during cheese manufacture. Milk that contains nutraceuticals and replacement ingredients for infant formula are other interesting avenues.",

The degree of unsaturation of the serum lipids, tissue fat, and milk fat may be increased promptly by feeding unsaturated fats in an encapsulated or protected form to lactating animals (Ashes et al., 1997). It is established that MUFA (C18:1) content can be increased by 50\u201380% and may approach 50% of milk fatty acids by feeding lipids rich in 18\u2010carbon fatty acids (Grummer, 1991).

The SFA content (palmitic acid, C16:0) of milk fat can also be reduced by 20\u201340% unless the supplemented lipid is rich in palmitic acid. SFA particularly palmitic and other medium\u2010chain fatty acids tend to increase levels of blood cholesterol (O'Donnell, 1993).",

As the melting point of milk fat containing unsaturated fatty acids is more, the spreadability of butter made from this milk improved tremendously. An Australian study involving the feeding of a special blend of canola and soybean meal in the protected form resulted in doubling the spreadability of butter (CSIRO, 1999). When taken out of a refrigerator at 5 \u00b0C, the butter was nearly as spreadable as margarine, without losing its special eating qualities. Clinical trials revealed that consumption of dairy products made from this milk led to decrease in low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in the blood of the consumers.",

The digestibility of nutrients was higher for rations containing calcium salts than for the control ration. The milk yield increased in proportion to the degree of unsaturation in the feed supplement. The fat content in milk reduced in all the experimental diets as compared to the control. The addition of calcium salts to the ration decreased the proportions of SFA that contained C6\u2013C16 and increased the proportions of C18:0, cis\u20109\u2010C18:1, and trans\u201011\u2010C18:1 in milk fat. These findings were confirmed later by Aigster et al.

The intake of total \u03c9\u20103 fatty acids in the United States is \u223c1.6 g/day (Kris\u2010Etherton et al., 2002). Of this, \u03b1\u2010linolenic acid (ALA) accounts for 1.4 g/day, whereas eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) together account only for 0.1\u20130.2 g/day. DHA is required by the brain and nerve cells and is essential for normal visual and neurological development in infants (Tomlinson, 2003). The major food sources of ALA are vegetable oils, principally canola and soybean oils. Oily fish are the richest source of EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA can be made by the body from ALA, but sometimes this capacity is impaired, so oily fish remains the best source. The recommendations for intake of \u03c9\u20103 fatty acids range from 0.5 to 2 g/day. ISSFAL (International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids) recommend 0.65\u2010g EPA and DHA per day (Willumsen, 2006). Of this, the content of each should be at least 0.22 g. Omega\u20106 is the essential fatty acid that is in ample supply in oils, nuts, and seeds.

The preharvest methodologies of reducing lactose involve either the introduction of \u03b2\u2010galactosidase enzyme into milk via mammary gland\u2010specific expression or the removal of \u03b1\u2010LA and gene \u201cknockout\u201d methodologies. Although these successful approaches provide valuable tools to address milk physiology, they reduce the overall sugar content of the milk, resulting in highly viscous milk. Studies on mice have revealed that reduction of lactose via \u03b1\u2010LA deletion was inappropriate because it impaired milk volume regulation. The milk of such mice was highly viscous with very high protein (88%) and fat (60%), no \u03b1\u2010LA and no lactose (Karatzas and Turner, 1997). Knocking out the UDP\u2010gal gene in mice also produced milk with no lactose but very high viscosity (Vilotte, 2002).",

They generated transgenic mice that selectively produced a biologically active \u03b2\u2010galactosidase in their milk. In these transgenic mice, the lactose content of the milk is at least halved, even though the \u03b2\u2010galactosidase expression levels were relatively low. The authors claim that it is likely that at least twofold greater levels of lactose reduction could be achieved. In contrast to the previous studies by Bremel 1989, Karatzas 1997, these experiments led to reduction in the lactose content while retaining most of the monosaccharide content of the milk. \u03b2\u2010galactosidase synthesis in the mammary gland caused a significant decrease in milk lactose (50\u201385%) without obvious changes in fat and protein concentrations. It thus helped to maintain a balanced nutrient supply as reflected in the similar growth curve reared on transgenic or control milk. It is likely that transgenic low\u2010lactose milk production could offer a more balanced approach to managing lactose intolerance than postharvest or lactose\u2010replacement products. It is also technically feasible to produce transgenic livestock carrying this transgene and probably similar or better expression levels could be achieved. However, more detailed analysis on several aspects such as the effect of splitting the lactose into glucose and galactose on the osmotic balance in the milk in the gut after ingestion and also the economic viability of the technology need to be investigated (Whitelaw, 1999).",

Many infants, especially those born before term, have low lipase activity. One potential application of transgenic technology could be to produce the human lipase, which is stimulated by bile salt in the milk of bovines. The lipase thus produced could be used as a constituent of infant formulas to increase the digestibility of milk lipids, particularly in premature infants who have low lipase activity (Lonnerdal, 1996).",

AAT is a single\u2010chain glycoprotein secreted by the liver and its main function is the inhibition of the enzyme elastase.

Milk of three of the ewes generated by Wright et al. (1991) expressed human AAT (hAAT) at levels greater than 1 g/liter. In one case, initial levels of hAAT exceeded 60 g/liter and stabilized at \u223c35 g/liter as lactation progressed. hAAT purified from the milk of these animals was fully N\u2010glycosylated and had a biological activity indistinguishable from human plasma\u2010derived material. These animals and their progeny exhibited stable transmission of the transgene. The founder animals yielded very similar levels of hAAT protein in milk continuously over several lactations. A flock of seven first generation ewes (derived from a founder male) yielded comparable levels of hAAT protein in first and second lactation milk. Two second generation ewes of this line also produced equivalent quantities of the human protein (Carver et al., 1993).

The first of these involves inserting additional copies of two cattle milk casein genes to increase the protein content of milk (www.agresearch.co.nz, 2001). The second one is to disrupt the \u03b2\u2010LG in order to decrease causes of milk allergies. The field tests also involve the insertion of a copy of the human myelin basic protein (MBP) gene in cattle. The protein, when secreted in their milk, may be purified and tested for its efficacy in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic demyelinating disease of the human central nervous system connected with clinical neurological signs of paralysis and histopathological changes. It is expected that secretion of MBP in cattle milk will allow the generation of large amounts of human MBP and will ultimately facilitate as a drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.",

Vaccines, while having limited success in reducing clinical symptoms, do not remove the organisms. Wang et al. (2002) report the identification and characterization of the gene for soluble CD14, which binds and neutralizes endotoxins responsible for mastitis. This soluble protein which can be found set in the membranes of white blood cells in cows was also discovered in cow milk. Just as the protein increases during coliform infections in humans and laboratory animals, it was shown to tone down the severe reaction of the bovines to coliform endotoxin as well as initiate a suitable response to the infiltrating bacteria. The gene was cloned and the recombinant bovine CD14 protein (rb\u2010CD14) produced was evaluated. Intraperitoneal injection of rb\u2010CD14 together with endotoxin reduced fatality in mice. Preliminary trials showed that intramammary injection of soluble rb\u2010CD14 is 100% effective in preventing mastitis by E. coli in lactating dairy cows. The workers have filed a patent application on rb\u2010CD14 which promises both effective treatment for infected cows and prevention in future cows genetically engineered with the gene.

Thus, one can foresee antibodies against Salmonella, Listeria, or other pathogens that will produce safer milk products. Active recombinant immunoglobulin capable of neutralizing Coronavirus was produced in mouse milk (Castilla et al., 1998). Increasing the concentration of IgA receptors in mammary cell may potentially lead to the accumulation of the protective antibodies in milk (De Groot et al., 1999). While recombinant immunoglobulins have been expressed in mammalian transgenic milk (Gavilondo et al., 2000), a calf with a gene that promotes the growth of red cells in humans has been produced by transgenesis (www.publicscan.fi).

Spider silk is made of protein\u2010based polymer filaments or threads secreted by specialized epithelial cells. These fibers are flexible and lightweight and have extraordinary strength and toughness comparable to those of synthetic high\u2010performance fibers. Spider silk is, thus, one of the strongest and most versatile naturally occurring materials in nature (Samson, 2004). Although it appears delicate and is one\u2010tenth the width of a human hair, it is stronger than steel and stretches more than nylon (www.sciam.com, 2002). Several attempts have been made to synthesize spider silk for industrial and medical applications. Unfortunately, the high shearing forces in conventional fermentations cause the spidroin protein to aggregate, making it useless for manufacturing fibers. So, these spider genes were introduced into the cells of lactating goats and they secreted silk in tiny strands along with their milk. These polymer strands could be woven into threads after extracting them from the milk and used for applications such as military uniforms, medical microsutures, and tennis racket strings (Anonymous, 2002). Nexia, a US company, has developed a strain of fast\u2010maturing Breed Early Lactate Early (BELE) transgenic goats that secretes the spider silk in milk (Dove, 2000).",

The spun fibers were water\u2010insoluble with diameters ranging from 10 to 40 \n\u03bcm and exhibited toughness and modulus values comparable to those of native dragline silks but had lower tenacity.

On the other hand, transgenesis involves the modification of the genetic line wherein the altered traits can be inherited by the progeny.

As the increase in the total solids is associated with a decrease in total milk volume, the net result is the same quantity of fat and protein being produced in a lesser total milk volume. If this technology could be extrapolated in dairy animals, milk that contains6.5% protein, 7% fat, 2.5% lactose, and 50% less water is not an improbable accomplishment. The advantages in terms of animal health would include less stress on the cow and on her udder since she would be producing one\u2010half her normal volume of milk and decrease in mastitis owing to less lactose availability for the causative organisms. The processing industry would gain in terms of (1) skim milk with twice protein content and half the lactose content of normal milk, (2) easier to produce low lactose or lactose\u2010free dairy products, (3) better product yields due to concentration, (4) reduction in total whey output because of low milk volume and lactose content, and (5) direct economic benefits in terms of 50% reduction in the cost of milk transportation owing to reduced volumes.",
