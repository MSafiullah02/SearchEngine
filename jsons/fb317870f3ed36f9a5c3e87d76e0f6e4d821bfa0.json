Such building blocks have only rarely been employed for the design of enzyme inhibitors. Herein, we demonstrate the combination of a peptidic recognition sequence with such electrophilic (het)arenes to generate highly active inhibitors of disease-relevant proteases. We further elucidate an unexpected mode of action for the trypanosomal protease rhodesain using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, enzyme kinetics and various types of simulations. After hydrolysis of an ester function in the recognition sequence of a weakly active prodrug inhibitor, the liberated carboxylic acid represents a highly potent inhibitor of rhodesain (K i = 4.0 nM). The simulations indicate that, after the cleavage of the ester, the carboxylic acid leaves the active site and re-binds to the enzyme in an orientation that allows the formation of a very stable \u03c0-complex between the catalytic dyad (Cys-25/His-162) of rhodesain and the electrophilic aromatic moiety. The reversible inhibition mode results because the S N Ar reaction, which is found in an alkaline solvent containing a low molecular weight thiol, is hindered within the enzyme due to the presence of the positively charged imidazolium ring of His-162.

Besides this reactive building block, enzyme inhibitors also contain a recognition unit fitting into the substrate binding pockets. In the case of protease inhibitors these are mainly peptidic or peptidomimetic sequences.

The computed structures are depicted in Figure 6 . In all model systems, the inhibitor was approximated by the substituted benzene ring. The model system without an imidazole ring mimics the situation of the reaction with 2-phenylethanethiol (9) in the presence of a base in ethanol, in which the reaction can be viewed as a simple thiolate attack at the substituted ring. The corresponding complexes are depicted in Figure 6 in the row \"only thiolate\". They were obtained by a full geometry optimization starting with a S . . . CX distance (X = F, NO 2 , H) of 1.9 \u00c5. The resulting complexes represent Meisenheimer complexes as can be deduced from the distances: the distances R(S . . . CX) remain at about 1.9 \u00c5 and the distances R(C Ar . . . X) are already considerably elongated. According to the more accurate MP2 or SCS-MP2 computations, the Meisenheimer complexes represent stable minima on the hypersurface, which lie about 4-13 kcal/mol lower than the reactants. The computations also indicate a stable pre-complex stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the NH group and the attacking thiolate, which according to the more accurate MP2-and SCS-MP2-calculations, is similarly stable as the Meisenheimer complexes. It should be noted that wB97XD considerably underestimates the stability of the Meisenheimer complexes. The computations are in good agreement with the experiment, which finds S N Ar reactions between 2-phenylethanethiol (9) in the presence of a base in ethanol at rt. Figure 6 also contains the 19 F NMR shifts relative to the value computed for the inhibitor. The computed variation upon the formation of the Meisenheimer complexes are magnitudes larger than the variation found experimentally for a possible inhibitor-enzyme complex (\u2248 1 ppm). Possible reactions between the substituted aromatic ring and the catalytic dyad of the enzyme differ from the solvent reaction in several ways. Besides steric restrictions, the thiolate group of the active-site cysteine residue is always stabilized by a strong salt bridge to the positively charged imidazolium ring of the active-site histidine residue, which might reduce the thiolate reactivity. To mimic this situation, we added a positively charged imidazolium ring to the model system. In the first calculation, we put the thiolate at a distance of about 1.9 \u00c5 from the attacked carbon center of the aromatic ring and performed a full geometry optimization. The resulting complexes are depicted in Figure 6 as \"thiolate and imidazolium: full optimization\". The more reliable MP2-or SCS-MP2-computations predict that the resulting complexes are stable with respect to the fragmentation into the inhibitor and thiolate/imidazolium complex. The computed complexes, however, are not Meisenheimer complexes as found for the situation without the imidazolium (only thiolate). The R(S . . . CX) distances are about 3.9-4.0 \u00c5 and the R(C Ar . . . X) are not elongated. Nevertheless, the stability of this complex upon fragmentation into inhibitor and thiolate/imidazolium complex is about 20 kcal/mol, i.e., they are even more stable than the Meisenheimer complexes found for the \"only thiolate\" situation. It should be noted that the situation found for the attack at C\u2212NO 2 does not reflect the situation in the enzyme, because the thiolate and the imidazolium ring interchange their positions during the full optimization to maximize the interaction energy. The same holds true for the attack at C\u2212F due to the orientation of the substituted ring. Both the pre-complex and the situation found for the attack at the CH group of the ring could also take place in the enzyme (see Section 2.7). To get more insights, we also built a complex in which we fixed the S-CX bond lengths to about 1.9 \u00c5, i.e., we enforced a kind of Meisenheimer complex in which the positively charged imidazolium is present. According to MP2 or SCS-MP2, the resulting complexes ( Figure 6 : thiolate and imidazolium: R(S\u2212CX fixed at 1.9 \u00c5)) are 4-10 kcal/mol less stable than the complex obtained by the full optimization. This indicates that a thiolate/imidazolium complex should not be able to form a Meisenheimer complex. Again, the 19 F NMR shifts were computed. Their variations with respect to the 19 F NMR shift of the pure inhibitor are also given in Figure 6 . It can be seen that the NMR shift variations found for the complexes are considerably smaller than those found for the corresponding Meisenheimer complexes. Furthermore, they are of similar size as the experimental shift difference. The comparison between the employed theoretical approaches clearly shows that the DFT functional \u03c9B97XD underestimates the stability of the complexes by up to 10 kcal/mol. Our model calculations indicate that the catalytic dyad of the enzyme, mimicked by a thiolate/imidazolium complex, behaves differently than a single attacking thiolate.

Among the inhibitors presented herein, which contain the dipeptide HN-l-Phe-l-Leu-OBn as the recognition unit for cathepsin L-like proteases, the 2-fluoro-3-nitro-substituted benzoic acid amide 4 and the 2-fluoro-4,5-dinitro-substituted aniline derivative 7 were discovered as very potent cathepsin L inhibitors.

For a single thiolate, the computations predict stable Meisenheimer complexes, which is in line with the observed S N Ar reactions. By contrast, for a thiolate/imidazolium dyad, a stable \u03c0-complex is found. The reaction potential of a further approach towards a Meisenheimer complex is repulsive, i.e., the reaction cannot take place. Consequently, while an irreversible reaction is predicted for a single thiolate, a reversible formation of a stable \u03c0-complex is computed for the thiolate/imidazolium dyad.

The complex seems to receive additional stability through a strong hydrogen bridge between the thiolate group of Cys-25 and the NH-substituent of the aromatic ring.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The conducted docking and MD simulations reveal several stable complexes between ester 7 and rhodesain, in which the substituted aromatic ring sits in the active site, i.e., in close vicinity to the reactive dyad. Nevertheless, reactions are not expected because MD simulations show that the distances are still too large. Additionally, no indication for the formation of a stable \u03c0-complex or the thiolate-NH bridge is seen. Hence, we expect that these complexes are less stable, which nicely explains the lower inhibitory potency of ester 7 compared to acid 8. Docking also predicts a reverse, substrate-like binding pose, which is ideal for the hydrolysis of the ester through rhodesain. MD simulations find this pose to be reasonably stable. For the acid 8 in rhodesain, docking and MD find very stable complexes in which the substituted aromatic ring and the catalytic Cys-25/His-162 dyad are sufficiently close. However, as described above, the reaction path towards the Meisenheimer complex only exhibits shallow minima for large distances (R(S-CH) or R(S-CNO 2 ) \u2248 3.1 -4.0 \u00c5) while it is repulsive for a further approach. This finding is in line with the reversible inhibition of rhodesain by acid 8.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, with the benzyl ester 7, we present an efficient prodrug that has a strong anti-trypanosomal effect and inhibits the trypanosomal protease rhodesain in vitro via the hydrolysis and subsequent reversible binding of the hydrolysis product 8 via a \u03c0-complex.

Within the pose depicted in Figure 9, the Cys-S . . . H-N distance is around 4.5 \u00c5, i.e., all MD simulations started from that distance. For some MDs this conformation was kept for the whole simulation (Figure 10d, Figure 11 conformation with Cys-S . . . H-N = 4.4 \u00c5). In other cases (Figure 10c, Figure 11 conformation with Cys-S . . . H-N = 2.5 \u00c5), a presumably more stable conformation is adopted in which the Cys-S . . . H-N distance decreases strongly and fluctuates around 2.2 \u00c5, indicating a strong hydrogen bond. While the distance Cys-S . . . H-N strongly differs between both conformations, the distances between the sulfur center of Cys-25 and the CH group of the substituted aromatic ring (Cys-S . . . H-C) remains constant. The latter indicates a strong interaction between the catalytic dyad Cys-25/His-162 and the electrophilic aromatic ring, which was also found for the model system (see Section 2.6). It is worth noting that for poses of the ester 7 in which the electrophilic aromatic ring was also in the vicinity of Cys-25 such a conformational change was not found. In the case of the ester, all poses stayed in conformations with quite long Cys-S . . . H-N distances. This indicates that the formation of the Cys-S . . . H-N bond is one reason for the strong inhibition potency of the acid, while the corresponding ester does not show a comparably strong inhibition.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF37": {"text": "Anti-trypanosomal activity of the (a) benzyl ester 7 and (b) acid 8 measured by the ATPlite assay.
