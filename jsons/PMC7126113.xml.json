Since a certain proportion of the delivered Vt remains in the proximal airways as dead space volume, the Vt must be more than the dead space volume for gas exchange to occur. Because Vts delivered with HFV are usually less than the anatomic dead space, this traditional concept of gas transport does not apply. Gas transport is thought to occur via a number of convective and diffusive mechanisms (Fig 3\n).13 These include the bulk flow of gas to alveolar units close to the proximal airways, asymmetric velocity profiles, and Taylor dispersion. The latter two mechanisms are related to augmented mixing of gas within the airways because of the high energies involved during HFV. In addition, there is asynchronous filling of adjacent alveolar spaces (termed pendelluft) due to different alveolar-emptying times, collateral ventilation through nonairway connections between neighboring alveoli, and cardiogenic mixing. To further understand these mechanisms, the reader is encouraged to refer to several excellent reviews.3\n10\n14\n15\n",

In a preterm lamb-based computer model,18 reducing the internal diameter of the ETT from 4.0 to 2.5 mm halved the transmission of the pressure waveform to both the carina and the alveolar compartment. These findings have significant implications as adult patients have larger ETTs and require lower frequencies compared to neonates. Hence, if larger Vts are generated, this mode of ventilation may not be as safe as originally thought. A recent preliminary clinical study of seven adults with ARDS by Hager et al,20 published in abstract form, was reassuring in that measured Vts while patients received HFOV ranged from 44 to 209 mL, which was substantially lower than the Vts commonly used in CMV.",

            "text": "Most of the earlier animal studies comparing HFOV and CMV utilized relatively high peak inspiratory pressures and Vts. Whether or not HFOV compares favorably to CMV applied with a \u201clung-protective\u201d strategy (ie, low Vt and high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]) has been the subject of several investigations.25\n28\n29\n30 Imai et al25 compared pathophysiologic and biochemical markers in a saline solution-lavaged rabbit model of ARDS treated with the following four different ventilatory strategies: (1) CMV with moderate Vts (10 to 12 mL/kg); (2) CMV with low Vts (5 to 6 mL/kg) and PEEPs 2 to 3 cm H2O higher than the lower inflection point; (3) CMV with low Vts and PEEPs of 8 to 10 cm H2O; and (4) HFOV. Rabbits treated with HFOV had less neutrophil infiltration, lower levels of tumor necrosis factor, and decreased pathologic changes in the alveolar spaces when compared to the other groups of rabbits. In contrast, Vasquez de Anda et al28 found no difference in lung mechanics and protein concentration in BAL fluid samples when comparing HFOV to pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) applied with high levels of PEEP in a rat model of ARDS. Compared with small animals, HFOV applied to adults with larger ETTs may lead to larger pressure swings and greater Vts. Unfortunately, there are currently few large animal studies of HFOV and ALI.31\n32\n33\n34 One study from 200333 compared PCV, HFOV, and intratracheal percussive ventilation in a sheep model of lung injury. The investigators found greater histologic damage in the PCV group, which was ventilated with relatively high Vts (8 mL/kg). Overall, more large animal studies are needed to compare HFOV and lung-protective CMV.",

The patients had a mean Pao\n2/Fio\n2 ratio of 68 mm Hg, an oxygenation index (OI) [Fio\n2 \u00d7 mPaw \u00d7 100/Pao\n2] of 48, and an APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II score of 23. All of the patients showed improvement in the OI with HFOV, and the overall survival rate was 47%. Of note, these authors observed that nonsurvivors had received CMV for a significantly longer duration prior to receiving HFOV than survivors. This finding suggests that HFOV may be more effective when initiated earlier in the course of ARDS. An alternate point of view is that patients in whom ARDS develops later in their ICU stay (and thus are candidates for an HFOV trial at a later time point) may have a poorer outcome, regardless of whether HFOV is used or not.",

In a study by Derdak et al,45148 adults in 13 centers were randomized to receive either HFOV or CMV. At baseline, patients in both groups were well-matched, with a mean age of 49.5 years, an APACHE II score of 22, and similar Pao\n2/Fio\n2 ratios (approximately 110). The main findings of this study were as follows: (1) an earlier improvement in the Pao\n2/Fio\n2 ratio (< 16 h) in the HFOV group, which did not persist beyond 24 h; and (2) a similar but low incidence of adverse events in both groups (intractable hypotension, 0 to 3%; air leak, 9 to 12%; mucus-plugging of ETT, 4 to 5%). The study was also notable for a nonsignificant trend toward a lower 30-day mortality rate in the HFOV group compared to that in the group receiving conventional ventilation (37% vs 52%, respectively; p = 0.102). As this study was performed before the publication of the first ARDS Network trial,9 relatively large Vts (10 mL/kg) with high peak inspiratory pressures were used, which has been a major criticism of this study.",

This was a surprising finding given that all previous studies35\n37\n51 have shown improvements in oxygenation with HFOV. The most likely explanation for this difference is that insufficient airway pressures (average mPaw, 25 cm H2O) were applied during HFOV in this study. Thus, the improvement in oxygenation in the prone HFOV group likely reflects the effect of the change in position only, and not the combined effect of the two modalities. Furthermore, the 12-h observation period may have been insufficient for maximal HFOV-induced lung recruitment, as other studies35\n45 have shown that the maximal improvement in oxygenation occurs beyond 12 h.",

However, in the two RCTs12\n46 of HFOV vs CMV that have been published so far, the incidence of pneumothorax and hypotension were comparable between the two groups. In the Treatment with Oscillation and an Open Lung Strategy pilot study,47 which applied repeated RMs as part of an aggressive lung recruitment strategy, only 1 patient (of 25) required withdrawal from HFOV for barotrauma. Two patients (8%) required a chest tube insertion for barotrauma, and eight RMs (of 244; 3.3%) were aborted because of hypotension. Recognition of a pneumothorax is a particular challenge in patients receiving HFOV. The background noise of the ventilator, coupled with the lack of true breath sounds due to minimal bulk flow, makes the detection of a pneumothorax by auscultation difficult. Often, reduction or asymmetry in the body wiggle, in response to the pressure waves, or a rise in \u0394P are clues that such an event has occurred.",

Previous studies have suggested that the earlier application of HFOV in adult patients with ARDS may lead to lower mortality when compared to CMV. Currently, the practice in our institution is to consider using HFOV once lung-protective ventilation with CMV is no longer possible (ie, an inability to adequately oxygenate or ventilate the patient while maintaining a plateau pressure of < 30 cm H2O and an Fio\n2 of < 0.6). These thresholds may be lower than what most clinicians would consider to be the \u201cfailure\u201d of CMV. Table 2\nshows the initiation settings for HFOV at our institution. We also favor RMs during the initiation of HFOV to accelerate lung recruitment. The reader should be aware that RMs are relatively contraindicated if there is significant barotrauma. In addition, because of the high mPaws used and the need for rapid alveolar emptying, HFOV is relatively contraindicated in patients with severe obstructive lung disease or asthma. Currently, a well-validated and standardized algorithm does not exist, and there are variations between institutions on many aspects, including mPaw titration protocol, the routine use of ETT cuff leaks to enhance CO2 clearance, RMs, weaning, transition back to CMV, and the use of other adjuncts (such as prone positioning and iNO).",

In addition, more clinical studies of HFOV are needed to address the many unanswered questions regarding the use of HFOV in adult patients with ARDS. What are the optimal timing, patient selection, and technique to be used? How do we optimally recruit the lung and measure this at the bedside? And finally, given the substantial mortality reductions with current CMV-based lung-protective strategies, HFOV needs to be compared directly with CMV in a large RCT with mortality as the primary outcome measure.",
