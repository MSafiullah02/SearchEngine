Informed consent was obtained for 90% of eligible participants (a few patients living in remote areas were not enrolled), and demographic and medical questionnaires were completed. Parents were advised to contact a research nurse whenever their child was experiencing a respiratory tract infection (with or without fever) severe enough to warrant medical evaluation. When contacted, the research nurse scheduled a medical appointment on the same day at the clinic (week days) or told the parents to consult at the emergency room of the Qu\u00e9bec City pediatric hospital (weekends and holidays). At both sites, physicians were instructed to collect a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) for virological analyses and to fill out a questionnaire on clinical symptoms. In addition, at monthly intervals (at the time of palivizumab administration), parents were asked about consultations or hospitalizations of their child. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Centre hospitalier universitaire de Qu\u00e9bec.",

In addition, a second aliquot (200 \u03bcl) of the NPA was reserved for a multiplex real-time PCR assay that amplifies influenza A matrix, influenza B matrix, HRSV F protein and HMPV nucleoprotein genes as previously described (Boivin et al., 2003, Hamelin et al., 2005). The lower limit of detection for the multiplex assay was 10/50 copies for influenza A/B, 100 copies for HRSV and 50 copies for HMPV using transcribed plasmids. The entire F gene sequence was determined from amplicons from each HRSV-positive specimen and was aligned with corresponding sequences of the A2 strain (GenBank accession number M11486) for genotype A viruses or with the B1 strain (GenBank accession number AF013254) for genotype B viruses.",

The protective effect of palivizumab was confirmed in a large multicenter clinical trial of 1502 high-risk children who received monthly antibody administration. This study demonstrated a 55% reduction in HRSV-related hospitalization (The IMpact-RSV Study Group, 1998). The protective effect of palivizumab was also confirmed in a subgroup of young children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (Feltes et al., 2003).",

Approximately 2/3 of these children were born prematurely before 33 weeks of gestation and 44% had an underlying disease. The mean number of palivizumab doses received was 5.7 per child and 38.8% (45/116) received more than 6 doses, highlighting the extended HRSV period in our community during that study. Despite palivizumab prophylaxis, HRSV was the most frequently detected virus, accounting for 33% of ARTI with confirmed viral etiology. HRSV-infected children had significantly less fever than subjects with other viral infections, but there was no significant difference in the rate of wheezing. Other viruses such as HMPV and rhinoviruses have been associated with wheezing episodes and exacerbation of asthma (Jartti et al., 2002, Williams et al., 2004). Also, HRSV-infected children were more frequently diagnosed with bronchiolitis than subjects with other viral infections (p\n = 0.07), but had less frequent episodes of URTI (p\n = 0.05). Thus, bronchiolitis was not completely prevented in children receiving palivizumab. However, among the 7 children with confirmed HRSV bronchiolitis, only one (the youngest child) required hospitalization and none had pneumonitis. Overall, such data confirm results from a previous placebo-controlled trial that showed that the main effect of palivizumab was to reduce hospitalization in patients with HRSV infections (The IMpact-RSV Study Group, 1998).",

As shown in Table 3, all HRSV infections occurred after a minimum of 4 doses of palivizumab (median 5.5) and a median of 14 days after the last dose. These breakthrough infections could not be explained by more intense viral circulation in the community since they occurred throughout the study period. Previous studies have shown that mean trough serum antibody concentrations increase with the number of palivizumab doses to reach 72 \u03bcg/ml after the fourth dose (The IMpact-RSV Study Group, 1998) and that levels of serum neutralizing antibody titers are good correlates of protection against HRSV (Piedra et al., 2003). An explanation for the occurrence of such HRSV infections may be that inadequate antibody levels were present in some children. Alternatively, palivizumab could have lost neutralizing activity due to emergence of specific viral mutations or other factors, such as specific cell-mediated immunity, may be involved in protection against HRSV infections.",

In particular, mutations at codon 272 (Lys \u2192 Met, Gln) and codon 268 (Asn \u2192 Ile) were associated with complete and partial in vitro resistance, respectively, to palivizumab. Of note, only the 272 mutants were associated with resistance to infused antibody in cotton rats (Zhao et al., 2004a, Zhao et al., 2004b, Zhao and Sullender, 2005). To date, there have been no reports of palivizumab-resistant HRSV strains in children, although only a limited number of viruses from infants receiving prophylaxis have been evaluated (DeVincenzo et al., 2004, Johnson et al., 1997). Of the 6 F protein amino acid changes found in our study, only one (Lys 272 Glu) was located in the putative drug-binding site and could potentially confer resistance to palivizumab. This mutant virus was selected after 7 doses of palivizumab and did not grow initially in cell culture (only RT-PCR was positive). Furthermore, the infected child had an uneventful bronchiolitis. These facts could suggest that this mutant virus had decreased viral fitness or that the antibody was still partially effective. Additional work is also required to evaluate the potential of a new humanized monoclonal antibody derived from palivizumab (Motavizumab, MedImmune Inc.), with a 70-fold increase in binding affinity, against some palivizumab-resistant strains (Mejias et al., 2005). The relevance of the other HRSV F protein changes detected in our study is unclear. A comparative analysis of our strains with 41 HRSV A and 15 HRSV B F protein sequences available in GenBank showed that only the Ser485Phe mutation had been previously reported in only one other HRSV A isolate (data not shown).",
