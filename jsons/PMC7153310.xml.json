Mainframe computer programs in the 1960s were developed to automate manufacturing planning, based on organized bills of materials for components and subassemblies, and/or for early military attack and targeting. The advent of small, low-cost microprocessors in the 1970s allowed computerized implementation of prior analog AI, such as self-steering boat systems (Francis West, 1979), following ES rules and algorithms to assert positive, intelligent control of many manufacturing, transportation, and related tasks.",

The goal of syndromic reporting was originally to obtain earlier, sentinel notice about potential local, regional, or national public health problems from real-time multiple data streams instead of waiting for retrospective, reactive reporting from physicians and hospitals. Since the original surge of interest in 2001, many additional nonterrorist possible benefits have been identified, including the unexpected transmission of highly contagious pandemic diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola, Zika, or avian flu.",
