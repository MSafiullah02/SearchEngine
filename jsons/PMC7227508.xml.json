PAA is the most often treated extracranial aneurysm (apart from the aorta), and thus constitutes an important clinical condition (3,4). The most common complications encompass distal embolization and thrombosis, leading to acute or chronic limb-threatening ischaemia. Rupture of PAA is rare and accounts for between 2% to 5% of cases in large series (5). It mainly occurs in large or septic aneurysms, as well as, many years after successful surgical exclusion (6).",
