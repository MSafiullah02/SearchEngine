However, several studies have shown that hospital-acquired infections with Gram-negative bacteria (GNB), especially AB, but not those with Gram-positive bacteria, are more common in the summer and are associated with high ambient outdoor temperatures (AOTs) [7\u201310]. The underlying mechanism for this seasonal variation remains poorly understood [10]. Studies reported in the literature are limited to the ward-based continuous surveillance, which could not determine whether A. baumannii isolates (ABI) are infected or colonized. Information on patient-specific analysis is scarce, and the independent association between bacterial infections and temperature is inconclusive, primarily due to the presence of considerable confounding variables [5, 8]. These reports also fail to provide practical temperature-related guidance for improving clinical outcomes of ICU patients.",

These factors were chosen because of their demonstrated roles in the viability, resistance, and virulence of AB [22, 23]. OmpA is a major AB virulence factor, essential for killing host cells, whereas both Bap and Bfs support the formation of biofilm, which protects the bacteria from host immune response. The formation of biofilms results in persistent and difficult-to-treat chronic infections [23]. RND pumps and intI1 play a crucial role in intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance and are also vital for exhausting biocides, dyes, detergents, and organic solvents from AB. Three RND pumps have been reported in AB: AdeABC, AdeIJK, and AdeFGH [22, 24]. In addition, Fsr (Ferric siderophore receptor), which has been shown by De Silva et al. to upregulation at low temperature, was used as the control gene [23]. Table S1 lists the primers used for qRT-PCR. The expression of target genes was normalized against 16SrRNA, which served as the baseline control, using the 2-\u0394\u0394C\u0442 method.

Therefore, cefoperazone/sulbactam was used for testing the impact of temperatures on antibiotic resistance. Consistent with the clinical observations, AB growing at 20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C had a significantly reduced viability and were more sensitive to antibiotics as compared to those growing at 35\u00b0C (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in AB growth at 30\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C (Fig. 4). We observed the upregulation of Fsr in AB cultured at 20\u00b0C compared to those at 35\u00b0C (P = 0.012). In contrast, the expression of genes encoding adeB, adeG, adeJ, OmpA, Bap, bfs, and intI1 were considerably reduced at 20\u00b0C (P < 0.005, Fig. 5). Together, these findings suggest that the vitality, antibiotic resistance, and virulence of AB are significantly reduced in the bacteria growing at 20\u00b0C.",

Our finding is also consistent with the previous reports that the crude mortality rates of patients with MDR-AB infections were 26%\u201347.8%, with 10%\u201343% attributable mortality [20, 25\u201327]. In addition, we found that the overall incidence of ABP (6.45%, 3.47/1000 patient-days) in our NICU was obviously lower than the incidences (17.00\u201327.63%, 4.18\u201314.26/1000 patient-days) have been reported [27\u201329]. The PABTBI of 16.39% was also lower than that of 19.1%\u201338.7% in other ICUs as previously reported [30, 31].

High temperatures may also promote the formation of a biofilm \u201cbloom\u201d of Acinetobacter species [40]. Similar seasonal variations have also been reported for other GNB such as K. pneumoniae and E. coli [37, 38, 41\u201343], as compared to Gram-positive infections that are more common in the winter [9, 44, 45].

Furthermore, the expression of genes related to vitality, virulence, and antibiotic resistance of AB is significantly reduced when they were cultured in 20\u00b0C compared to those grew at 35\u00b0C. De Silva et al. suggested that the upregulation of Fsr may be due to lower iron transport efficiency at low temperature [23]. This finding may explain why patients with MDR-ABP treated in LTLFW wards achieved significantly improved outcome. Owing to the ability to survive on environmental surfaces and patients skin, AB strains can cause widespread contamination and cross-infection in the hospital environment [12, 27]. An increased density of environmental AB will increase the probability of human\u2019s exposure. The ability to invade human tissues may increase owing to the expression of virulence factors, and increased resistance makes it difficult to cure.",
