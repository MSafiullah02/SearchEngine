            "text": "Background: The DWBC (the ratio between DIFF and BASO counts of the Sysmex XT-2000iV), hereafter defined as DTNC (total nucleated cells), is high in effusions due to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), as cells are entrapped in fibrin clots formed in the BASO reagent. Similar clots form in the Rivalta's test, a method with high diagnostic accuracy for FIP. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy for FIP and the optimal cutoff of DTNC. Methods: After a retrospective search of our database, DIFF and BASO counts, and the DTNC from cats with and without FIP were compared to each other. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+, LR\u00c0) were calculated. A ROC curve was designed to determine the cutoff for best sensitivity and specificity. Results: Effusions from 20 FIP and 31 non-FIP cats were analyzed. The DTNC was higher (P < .001), and BASO and DIFF counts were lower (P < .001 and P < .05) in FIP than in non-FIP cats. Only 2 FIP cats with atypical effusions had a DTNC < 3.0. The cutoff identified by the ROC curve (area under curve: 0.94; P < .001) was 1.7 (Sensitivity = 90.0%; Specificity = 93.53%; LR+ = 13.9; LR\u00c0 = 0.1). A DTNC > 2.5 had 100% specificity. Conclusions: The DTNC has a high diagnostic accuracy for FIP-related effusions by providing an estimate of precipitable proteins, as the Rivalta's test, in addition to the cell count. As fibrin clots result in false lower BASO counts, the DTNC is preferable to the WBC count generated by the BASO channel alone in suspected FIP effusions.",

Among these, serum protein electrophoresis and the a1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) measurement may support a clinical suspicion of FIP.

The protein content is usually high with a decreased albumin to globulin ratio. 7 Cell counts range from 2-6 9 10 9 /L, sometimes up to 30 9 10 9 /L 8 , and the cytologic pattern, which is only highly suggestive but not definitely diagnostic for FIP, consists mostly of nondegenerate neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and rare plasma cells in a proteinaceous background. 1 Conversely, the Rivalta's test has been recently proposed as a test with high accuracy for the diagnosis of FIP. 9 The Rivalta's test is an inexpensive, easy to perform assay, used to differentiate transudates from exudates. The positive reaction to the acetic acid is due to the presence of a high concentration of proteins, including fibrinogen and other acute phase proteins which visibly clot upon contact with acids. 10 These components are particularly abundant in effusions from cats with FIP, but can also be increased in effusions due to bacterial peritonitis and pleuritis or lymphoma.",

Several studies demonstrated the diagnostic utility of Rivalta's test for FIP based on its high sensitivity and accuracy. 9 In a recent study on canine and feline effusions it was shown that the Delta (D) TNC (the ratio between total nucleated cell counts [TNCC] in the DIFF and BASO channel of the laser counter Sysmex XT-2000iV, reported by the instrument as DWBC) is higher in effusions of cats affected by FIP than in other effusions. 11 The BASO channel uses an acidic reagent that induces the collapse of the cells, except for basophils. In FIP effusions, this reagent induces also the formation of clots entrapping the cells and resulting in a falsely low BASO count. Therefore, this mechanism, responsible for the increase in the DTNC, is very similar to the analytic principle of the Rivalta's test.",

Recently, the Rivalta's test has been found to be highly diagnostic for FIP, although, as any other test, its specificity and sensitivity are not 100%. 9 In the present study, it was investigated whether cell counts performed in the laser-based Sysmex XT-2000iV that has the so-called BASO channel in which cells are counted after precipitation in an acidic reagent provide diagnostic information similar to the Rivalta's test. This was suggested by a previous study that, however, included only a few specimens of effusions from cats with FIP. 11 In our study, we had the opportunity to investigate a larger number of cats with or without FIP. Very stringent inclusion criteria for the FIP group granted for a very well-defined positive study population. Unfortunately, the \"non-FIP\" group was composed largely of neoplastic effusions that were not as challenging for a differential diagnosis from FIP, as the 2 conditions may be easily differentiated by cytology. Therefore, a possible limitation of this study is the low number of nonneoplastic effusions that in routine practice may benefit from an additional test to distinguish FIP from other types of inflammatory or reactive effusions. However, also in the previous feline effusions study 11 , all the specimens from cats with inflammatory effusions other than FIP had a DTNC < 1, confirming that a DTNC > 1 has a high diagnostic accuracy for FIP.",

Specifically, as cells are entrapped in clots formed by fibrinogen precipitation in the BASO channel, cell counts in the BASO channel (BASO-TNCC) are usually lower than those of the DIFF channel. This mechanism explains why the DTNC (in the Sysmex referred to as DWBC) increases in such specimens. Based on our results, DTNC has a high diagnostic accuracy for FIP, which was supported by sensitivity and specificity > 90% and the ROC curve. Specifically, with a positive likelihood ratio close to 14, a DTNC > 1.7 makes it 14 times more likely that an effusion originates from a cat with FIP rather than a different disease. Conversely, a negative likelihood ratio of 0.11 suggests that with a DTNC < 1.7, the probability that the effusion comes from a cat with FIP is about one-tenth of the probability that the effusion comes from a cat with a different disease.",

Specifically, the effusion in one cat with hypoalbuminemia and a hemorrhagic syndrome was classified as a transudate. 20 All these changes are consistent with liver failure that may induce also hypofibrinogenemia, likely preventing clotting in the BASO reagent. In the other case, the cytologic pattern of the effusion was complicated by the presence of \"atypical\" mesothelial cells that are usually less abundant in FIP effusions than neutrophils and lymphocytes. However, this may represent a feature typical for pericardial effu-sions, often leading to a misdiagnosis of neoplasia. 17 Therefore, in both cases, the false-negative results of DTNC may be related to atypical features of the effusion rather than the low analytic sensitivity. As regards specificity, only 2 false-positive results were found; one lymphoma case, which in people sometimes provides positive Rivalta's test results 10 , possibly due to the presence of fibrinogen associated with an inflammatory reaction against the tumor itself, and one case with a poorly cellular fluid, in which the high DTNC was clearly a mathematical artifact due to analytical sensitivity of the instrument. However, both these cases do not represent a diagnostic challenge in routine practice as FIP may be easily excluded if additional investigations such as cytology of effusions are added to the diagnostic workup. Independently on these few cases, the analysis of effusions with the Sysmex-XT2000iV counter evidenced a sensitivity and a specificity comparable to or even higher than that previously reported for the Rivalta's test 9 , likely because the mechanisms are very similar. The Rivalta's test is rapid, cheap, and accurate, but it may be limited due to some preanalytic or analytic factors. For example, the test may be inaccurate due to inappropriate techniques or intrinsic factors of the reagents such as concentration of acetic acid, different temperatures of the effusion, and the acetic acid solution. Moreover, the reaction may be negative when pH increased to 4.6 or higher. 8, 10 Additionally, the Rivalta's test provides semi-quantitative results (negative, weakly or strongly positive) and does not allow grading the severity of the change. Finally, the evaluation of the test is subjective and no information about inter-observer variability is currently available. Conversely, the analysis with the Sysmex-XT2000iV counter is more standardized in terms of reagents, although the repeatability study demonstrated that, limited to FIP effusions, it may suffer from a poor precision which however did not affect the interpretation of the results, as DTNC was always > 1.0. Moreover, the test is rapid and, in one single measurement, provides information on the presence of precipitable proteins, and a provisional information on the cell types based on the scattergram 11 in addition to the cell count. However, it must be stressed that the linearity under dilution test performed in this study demonstrated that the more accurate cell count provided by the instrument is the DIFF-TNCC that is not affected by the entrapment of cells in the clots formed after contact with the BASO reagent. Therefore, in routine practice, it is not recommended to use the default WBC counts that are generated by the BASO channel. Conversely, when FIP is clinically suspected, it may be recommended to directly check the results of the DIFF-TNCC and the DTNC that are reported in the Service screenshot of the software. Moreover, in future studies, it may be interesting to assess whether other laser-based instruments such as those of the ADVIA series that use a similar analytic principle to count basophils in peripheral blood 14 provide the same interesting results on FIP effusions.",

This depends on the formation of clots in the BASO reagent that entrap the cells, similarly to what occurs in the Rivalta's test that has also been reported to have a high diagnostic accuracy for FIP. This reaction leads to a low BASO-TNCC even when DIFF-TNCC counts are high. Therefore, in routine practice, it is not recommended to use the default TNCC counts generated by the BASO channel, but to directly use the DIFF-TNCC and especially the DTNC, particularly when FIP is suspected. In these cases, a DTNC > 1.7 is highly suggestive of FIP, and a DTNC > 3.4 may be considered diagnostic for FIP. ",
