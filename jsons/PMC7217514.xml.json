A considerable proportion of the infected were coinfected by pneumonia [7,8], and most deaths where caused not directly by the virus, but by the secondary bacterial infection.

            "text": "Recently, Newman and Ferrario [10] introduced a model of coinfection based on the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model [11] with two diseases diffusing over the same contact network. One disease spreads freely while the second can infect only individuals already infected with the first. The authors assume total asymmetry and time-scale separation in the spreading of the two pathogens. The system displays two epidemic thresholds, the first one being the usual SIR threshold, the second occurring when the fraction of the population infected with the first disease becomes large enough to allow the spread of the second. No qualitative changes in the nature of the outbreaks appear. In [12] Chen, Ghanbarnejad, Cai, and Grassberger (CGCG) introduced a generalized SIR model (CGCG model) to include mutual cooperative effects of coinfections. In the CGCG model two different diseases simultaneously spread in a population. Having been infected with one disease gives an increased probability to get infected by the other. The amount of this increase is a proxy of the mutual cooperativity between the two diseases. The authors study the model at the mean-field level and observe that cooperative effects, depending of their strength, can cause a change of the transition from continuous to discontinuous. In [13] Janssen and Stenull showed that the CGCG model is equivalent, in the mean field, to the homogeneous limit of an extended general epidemic process and clarify the spinodal nature of the discontinuous transition observed. In [14,15] CGCG analyzed how in their model the type of transition depends on the contact network topology by simulating the CGCG model on both random networks and lattices. They concluded that a necessary condition for discontinuous transitions to occur, when starting from a doubly infected node, is the relative paucity of short loops with respect to long ones. More in detail they argue that a discontinuous transition occurs if the two epidemics first evolve separately and, only after the independent clusters of singly infected nodes have reached endemic proportions, the two epidemics meet: At that point cooperativity implies that both clusters rapidly become doubly infected. A necessary condition then is that there are few short loops (otherwise, the two pathogens immediately cooperate and the transition is continuous) and there are long loops (otherwise, cooperativity has no effect and one sees only single infections). In agreement with this scenario, CGCG do not observe discontinuous transitions on trees and on two-dimensional (2D) lattices, while they do observe them on Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) networks, on 4D lattices, and on 2D lattices with sufficiently long-range contacts. On 3D lattices the existence of discontinuous transitions depends on the details of the microscopic realization of the model. Moreover, the observed discontinuous transitions are of hybrid type [16,17], i.e., exhibiting also some features of continuous ones. For other recent work about cooperating infections, see Refs. [18\u201320].",

We first numerically show that for power-law-distributed networks of large size the transition is asymptotically discontinuous, if cooperativity is sufficiently high; however, strong size effects may conceal the real nature of the transition in finite systems, so that the transition appears continuous even for large networks. We then present an analytical heterogeneous mean-field approach to the problem, which allows us to derive a number of predictions, including the position of the threshold, the nature of the transition and the associated critical exponent. Numerical simulations validate the analytical predictions. The theoretical approach indicates that for scale-free networks, with diverging second moment of the degree distribution, the transition can only be continuous.",

When recovering from one disease an individual becomes immune to that disease, but she can still be infected by the other. The model is totally symmetric with respect to A and B. Since each individual can be in one of three possible states (S, I, R) with respect to each of the two diseases (A, B), there are nine possible states for each individual, denoted by S, A, B, AB, a, b, aB, Ab, and ab, where, for each disease, capital letters refer to the infected state, while lowercase letters refer to the removed state.

The origin of the discontinuity is traced back to the relative abundance of long loops compared to the scarcity of short loops in the topology. It is well known [22] that the clustering coefficient of uncorrelated random networks is\n(1)C=\u2329k\u232aN\u2329k2\u232a\u2212\u2329k\u232a\u2329k\u232a22.Hence, the clustering coefficient vanishes for large size for any \u03b3>2. However, this occurs differently depending on the value of \u03b3. The factor in parentheses in Eq. (1) is finite for \u03b3>3, but its value becomes larger as \u03b3 gets smaller. Hence, we do expect that for systems of fixed size N the transition will be discontinuous for large \u03b3, but the residual clustering will make the transition appear continuous as \u03b3 is reduced. This expectation is tested by simulating the CGCG dynamics on networks of fixed size (N=105), large cooperativity (q=0.99), and growing values of \u03b3 starting from \u03b3=3 (Fig. 1). As expected, upon increasing \u03b3, the transition becomes discontinuous: Short loops become less abundant as \u03b3 grows so that the two infections evolve separately and give rise to cooperative effects only after they meet following one long loop in the network.",

This qualitative change does not allow one to draw firm conclusions on the nature of the transition for \u03b3<3. Asymptotically, the clustering coefficient vanishes also in this case, but it does so slowly so that it might be impossible for the two epidemics to grow initially separated clusters. Therefore, we cannot say whether the continuous transition observed in Ref. [14] is a finite-size effect or not. More on this issue will be provided by the analytical results in the next section.",

In this way we have derived an expression for the epidemic threshold, which does not depend on cooperativity, in agreement with simulations. Moreover, the approach allows us to derive, for power-law degree-distributed topologies, the range of cooperativity values for which the transition is continuous and the associated critical exponent. We find a nice confirmation that the discontinuous transition occurs when cooperativity is sufficiently high and local clustering is instead small. An interesting point in this respect regards what happens for scale-free networks, i.e., for 2<\u03b3<3. In such a case HMF theory predicts that the transition is continuous for any value of the cooperativity W. This is in agreement with the simulation results for BA networks presented in Ref. [14,15] for networks of moderate size. However, one cannot, in principle, exclude that also for \u03b3<3 the continuous transition observed in simulations is just a finite-size effect. While HMF theory seems to indicate the contrary, the global clustering coefficient Eq. (1) vanishes as the system size diverges also for \u03b3<3, so that asymptotically there are no short loops in the system. Numerical simulations cannot be conclusive about this question. The issue could be clarified only by a careful analysis of the balance between the relative abundance of short loops (encoded by C) and long loops in the network. It remains as a challenging goal.",
