Until HBoV was discovered, parvovirus B19 was the sole human parvovirus, which can hardly be cultured in in vitro cell cultures, likely because it strongly depends on the optimal cell cycle phase.4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9., 10., 11., 12., 13. This latter fact hampered the development of potent and specific antivirals, tenacity studies, and the development of disinfectants active against human parvoviruses as surrogate pathogens with animal pathogenicity were used. The discovery of HBoV led to a couple of molecular findings that are of major general interest for the human parvovirus biology and clinics. Within a primary cell culture that productively replicated the human bocavirus, it was possible to identify the HBoV transcriptome, including the splicing variant of viral RNA.14 This cell culture displayed for the first time a tool for the investigation of a human parvovirus in its natural infectious surrounding enabling follow up studies on the molecular biology of human parvoviruses in general, and HBoV in particular.",

In search for a broadly convertible replication system the group of Jianming Qiu from Kansas made a significant step forward: by establishing a plasmid based replicon-like system the group identified additional RNA species that are transcribed during the HBoV replication cycle.15 The system is based on plasmids that contain the complete published HBoV sequence but are flanked by ITR-regions of the adeno-associated virus (AAV); the ITR-regions are terminal repeats containing palindromic sequences that form hairpin-like structures, which in turn are required for the replication of parvoviruses according to the so-called rolling hairpin mechanisms of replication.16\n",

In theory, the rolling hairpin replication results in progeny genomes that occur in equal amounts of both polarities, while packaging of viral genomes is dependent on additional factors.17., 18., 19., 20., 21., 22., 23. For almost four decades, it was postulated that all parvoviruses replicate according to this mechanism, although this replication model is solely based on experimental data obtained by the research on rodent parvoviruses. The model is characterized by a terminal hairpin dependent self-priming initiation of the viral genome replication and concatemeric replication intermediates of head-to-head or tail-to-tail replication intermediates. Based on an early publication of the postulated model in 1976 in Nature, this replication model became a dogma in the field of parvovirology and was deemed to be true for all parvoviruses. Interestingly, it was impossible to identify both genome polarities in clinical samples containing HBoV infected cells.24 Thereby, NASBA analyses revealed that all HBoV strains package negative strand genome while only a minority also package the plus strand; this observation is compatible with another replication mechanism, known as rolling circle replication. A couple of systematic PCR-based analyses were performed to test the hypothesis if rolling circle replication may occur in HBoV infection and to decipher the unknown terminal hairpins.25\n",

Most recently, it was shown that these sequences most likely represent the missing terminal hairpin like structures,25., 26. and it is likely that the virus was originally transmitted as a zoonosis (Fig. 5.1\n). Despite identifying the terminal sequences in clinical samples and also in cell cultures, not only a lack of self-priming activity of HBoV-genomes but also the lack of intermediates typical for rolling hairpin replication were observed. Instead, the samples contained head-to-tail structures. Several groups published similar observations, all tackling the dogma of parvovirus replication.27., 28., 29., 30. It is therefore important to know that the head-to-tail episomal form of HBoV differs from formerly described circular parvoviral episomes that have been shown to consist of circular closed genome dimers of head-to-head and tail-to-tail orientation.31\n",

Thereby, this infection model harbors a surprising feature that is a further hint for an alternative replication of the human bocavirus\u2014if the full-length HBoV plasmid containing the hairpin sequences is transfected into HEK293 cells, then infectious progeny virions are produced, although based on the rolling hairpin model this process must be impossible because the free (!) hairpin sequences are believed to be essential for the replication. In contrast, in the plasmid they are flanked by the vector\u2019s backbone sequence, replication is possible although no helper plasmids are required as known for the dependoviruses. This simple observation strongly contradicts the model of rolling hairpin replication but in turn favours other replication models known for circular DNA, for example the rolling circle replication, which in the natural infection would produce head-to-tail concatemers.",

Recently, a clinical case was observed in which the HBoV infection appeared to depend on coinfection and coreplication of human herpesvirus type 6. In this case, the HBoV infection persisted because of an immune disease but was terminated by antiviral therapy with cidofovir which is directed against HHV6.41 This was the key observation leading to the assumption that HBoV is either sensitive to cidofovir or that a possible rolling circle HBoV replication is triggered by HHV6, which in turn would explain the high frequency of coinfections observed in case of HBoV.40., 42., 43.\n",

In the context of a putative chronic HBoV infection or a persistence of HBoV at a subclinical level, it thus appears possible that HBoV could directly or indirectly, by interactions with the immune system, contribute to chronic lung disease such as idiopathic lung fibrosis.",

Whereas, HBoV does not induce a clear Th1 or Th2 response.125 Furthermore, the HBoV dependent regulated cytokines include a subset of cytokines which are known to be involved in several cancer-associated pathways, supporting the hypothesis that HBoV may be associated with long term diseases or even cancerogenesis.126., 127., 128. Although this hypothesis requires further prospective studies, HBoV DNA was detected in lung- and colorectal tumors. Detection of HBoV DNA, eventually combined with persistence, was described besides detection in normal lung tissue,104 and in lung- and colorectal tumors,128 in other tissues such as, tonsils,27., 129., 130., 131. and myocardium, and may affect further tissues that have not yet been tested for HBoV-positivity.",

Moreover, fibrosis is related to expression of TNF and IL-8, and it is worth mentioning that the neutralization of TARC leads to a\nreduction of fibrosis in the animal model.133., 135. In addition, an elevation of the TARC/IP-10 ratio is also characteristic for fibrosis and was previously discussed as a marker for IPF.136\n",

This leads to the conclusion, that HBoV colonisation/chronic infection may be at least one trigger that could stimulate airway remodelling. However, it could be argued that in vivo not only the resident airway epithelial cells are involved in the immune response but also additional patient specific factors will contribute to altered profibrotic cytokine profiles. To address this problem, experiments in an air-liquid-interface culture of human airway epithelial cells were performed. These experiments confirmed that the profibrotic cytokines were expressed by the infected cell cultures but were hardly or not at all expressed in mock-infected cells and they reveal that the identified cytokines belong to the initial immune response after HBoV infection (123).",
