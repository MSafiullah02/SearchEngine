In these cases, it is possible to follow the loops of bowel to the transition point, which often is a single band that can be divided easily. Manipulation of the small bowel should be done carefully using atraumatic graspers. If possible, it is preferable to manipulate collapsed loops first. Conversion should be considered if multiple adhesions are found, or if manipulation of grossly distended loops is required. The risk of tearing the thin-walled friable, dilated bowel is high, and a tear in the distended loop will lead to gross contamination of the peritoneal cavity.
