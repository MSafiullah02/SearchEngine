They are responsible for the fragrance, taste, and pigment of plants.1 Terpenes are classified on the basis of organization and number of isoprene units it contains (see footnote 1). An isoprene unit is a building block of terpenes that is a gaseous hydrocarbon that contains the molecular formula C5H8 (see footnote 1). Terpenes and terpenoids are terms that are often used interchangeably but the two terms have slight differences; terpenes are an arrangement of isoprene units that are naturally occurring, volatile, unsaturated 5-carbon cyclic compounds that give off a scent or a taste to defend itself from organisms that feed off of certain types of plants (see footnote 1). Terpenes have many functions in plants such as a thermoprotectant, signaling functions, and not limited to, pigments, flavoring, and solvents but also have various medicinal uses (Yang et al. 2012). Table 15.1 shows the different types of terpenes discussed in this chapter along with an example of that terpene.",

Among natural products that mediate antagonistic and beneficial interactions within the organism, terpene play a variety of roles (Gershenzon 2007). Terpene protects many living organisms like microorganisms, animals and plants from abiotic and biotic stresses (Gershenzon 2007). Terpene can ward off pathogens, predators, and competitors. Living organisms use terpene for multiple reasons like medicinal purposes and communications about food, mates, or enemies (Gershenzon 2007). It is impressive how different organisms use terpene for common purposes even though terpene contain many forms and varieties (Gershenzon 2007).",

Tea tree oil is a volatile essential oil and is famous for its antimicrobial properties, and acts as the active ingredient that is used to treat cutaneous infections (Carson et al. 2006) Apart from the flavor that gives to food, essential oil contain antimicrobial properties (Bound et al. 2015). Thyme is one of plants that synthesize terpene alcohols and phenols which contain powerful antibacterial and antifungal properties (Bound et al. 2015). Terpene synthesized from cannabis also long served as medicines (Perry et al. 2000). They also contain psychoactive properties and used against many infectious diseases (Perry et al. 2000). is famous for anti-dementia (current memory-enhancing) drugs by enhancing cholinergic activity via inhibition of cholinesterase (Perry et al. 2000).

The evergreen tree is native to the Mediterranean area where it has to survive under hot and dry conditions and synthesis of these monoterpenes may have been an adaptive mechanism for the plants to survive under heat stress.2 This tree does not emit isoprenes but it emits monoterpenes and is able to handle different environmental stresses such as drought, salt, and heat (see footnote 2). A particular study done by Loreto et al. (2002) were conducted to visualize monoterpene production in response to high temperatures and to see if thermotolerance is increased with monoterpenes (Loreto et al. 2002). In this study, the leaves were exposed in 5 \u00b0C intervals ranging from the temperatures 30 \u00b0C to 55 \u00b0C and leaves were kept under conditions in which inhibited or allowed monoterpenes to synthesize (Loreto et al. 2002). The results that were found in this experience was a discovery of seven most abundant monoterpenes which was emitted at the maximum temperature of 35 \u00b0C and decreased its abundance over time as the temperatures increased and \u03b1-pinene had the greatest abundance of emittance at 35 \u00b0C as well as other terpenes but greatly reduced over higher temperatures (Loreto et al. 2002). At 55 \u00b0C the monoterpenes, myrcene and limonene had higher emission rates compared to temperatures around 35 \u00b0C (Loreto et al. 2002). Photosynthesis was also decreased when the leaves were exposed to any temperature that was higher than 30 \u00b0C and at 55 \u00b0C showed a loss of CO2 and recovery occurred around 30 \u00b0C (Loreto et al. 2002). Overall, the monoterpenes showed that their optimal temperature for emission was around 30\u201335 \u00b0C (Loreto et al. 2002). Researchers prove that the emission of monoterpenes is under enzymatic control due to their optimal temperatures (Loreto et al. 2002).",

It also plays a role in plants in response to various environmental stresses. It regulates the closure of the stoma by regulating ion channels and exchange of water across the plasma membrane (Giraudat 1995). Cyclic ADP-ribose signals abscisic acid in response to drought-stressing conditions from the environment (Giraudat 1995). Abscisic acid is not unique to plants, it has shown to be present in the central nervous system of other organisms such as pigs and may play a role in humans as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and stimulator of insulin release in the human pancreas (Chadwick et al. 2013). Gossypol is a sesquiterpene that is found in cotton plants. It has anticancer properties and can potentially inhibit fertility in male humans which is why it must be removed from essential oils and various other products before human use or consumption. Avarol, a sesquiterpenoid that has shown to have antimicrobial and antifungal uses, is effective against the AIDS virus in humans (see footnote 3).4",

The role of sesquiterpenes in these flowering plants are not solely made for human use but for the purpose of protecting the plant from predators and are produced de novo in response to microbial attack and ultraviolet ray protection (Chadwick et al. 2013). Their bitter taste is a defense mechanism against herbivores from feeding on them but some have sweet tastes or tastes that are pleasant to certain organism for the purpose of spreading their seeds and being fertilized in different areas (Chadwick et al. 2013). Sesquiterpenes have many uses in traditional, western medicine because they contain so many anticancer, antiplasmodial, and anti-inflammatory activities (Chadwick et al. 2013). Sesquiterpenes lactones are able to reduce stomach ulcers in some people and are also present in powerful antimalarial drugs (Chadwick et al. 2013). Artemisinin, a metabolite produced from Artemisia annua, which contains sesquiterpene lactone produced in the roots and shoots of the plants, is used in drugs to treat malaria (Chadwick et al. 2013). Other uses of this family of flowers is for treatment of bacterial infections, migraines, and to improve skin (Chadwick et al. 2013). Lettuce opium has been used for many years as a painkiller (Chadwick et al. 2013).",

Tanshinones have recently been extensively researched for their anticancer properties in vitro and in vivo (Zhang et al. 2012). Their potential use as an anticancer drug comes from their broad range of activities such as anti-proliferation and inhibiting adhesion, migration, and invasion (Zhang et al. 2012). Analogues of tanshinone have been synthesized in many clinical trials because they have many anticancer attributes (Lee et al. 2015). This herb has been used in many Asian countries for preventative and therapeutic solutions to many diseases such as heart disease, vascular diseases, and arthritis (Zhang et al. 2012).

From MEP, it reacts with CTP to create 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol (Hunter 2007). A phosphate is released in this reaction and then reacts with ATP-dependent IspE to make 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol 2-phosphate and ADP and then reacts with the enzyme IspF to create 2C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodophosphate (Hunter 2007). The enzyme requires metal cations. Then finally, in the least understood step of the reaction, the two enzymes, IspG and IspH make the two products, IPP and DMAPP by using a two-electron reduction (Hunter 2007).

The main active ingredient, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, otherwise known as THC, is a psychoactive agent and is a focus for controversy in society because it binds to the human endocannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain such as the hippocampus and the frontal cortex, which are responsible for memory, cognition and attention.7 How THC works is by taking the place of endocannabinoids, naturally occurring chemicals in the human body (see footnote 7). One of the most common and well known molecules that THC replaces in the human body is called anadamide (see footnote 7). To this day, scientists are researching to discover the exact role of this molecule in the human body.",

With the rising malarial infections and drug resistance, terpenes have gained more attention towards it through antiplasmodial activity (Nogueira and Lopes 2011). The interesting mechanism behind the terpene activity is that it binds to the hemin part of infected erythrocytes and kills the parasite just like the famous antimalarial drug chloroquine (Orjih et al. 1981; Kayembe et al. 2012). Hemin is made of iron which is necessary for the plasmodium development in the erythrocytes. Though hemin breaking enzymes are not yet found in plasmodium, it could be one reason why hemin binding accounts for parasite lysis (Ginsburg and Demel 1984). Another study suggests that drug-hemin complex binds to phospholipid layers thereby disrupting the respective membrane structure and causing cell lysis (Ginsburg and Demel 1984). Moreover, it is also known that hemin can affect the carbohydrate metabolism of the parasites, which could lead to lysis of parasites (Rodriguez and Jungery 1986). Thus, terpenes can be designed to be promising drugs for malaria.",

They form a major constituent of essential oils in plants which indicates monoterpenes play a major role in defense for plants (Grabmann 2005). A 2005 study evaluated the in vitro antiviral activity of several essential oils extracted from South American plants (Duschatzky et al. 2005). The oil extracts were tested against three major human viruses\u2014herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1), dengue virus type 2, and Junin virus. The oils that were proved to be virucidal were mainly composed of monoterpenes, namely, carvone, carveol limonene, alpha- and beta-pinene, caryophylene, camphor, beta-ocimene, and one sesquiterpene which is germacrene (Duschatzky et al. 2005). A similar study in 2008 analyzed the essential oils of seven plants from Lebanon for in vitro antiviral activity (Loizzo et al. 2008). The viruses under investigation were HSV1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS CoV). The results were positive for antiviral effects, and the major constituents were alpha- and beta-pinene, beta-ocimene, and 1,8-cineole (Loizzo et al. 2008). Following this, a 2009 study on also had similar results which suggested 1,8-cineole, \u03b1-pinene, caryophyllene oxide, and sabinene to be the major components of virucidal oils (Alim et al. 2009). Functional data from these studies reveal that a few monoterpenes are shared by various plants for antiviral properties (Alim et al. 2009). These shared monoterpenes could be of importance as they are present universally.",

(2009) using eucalyptus, tea tree, and thyme essential oil extracts (Astani et al. 2009). They suggested that monoterpene hydrocarbons have a slightly higher virulent activity compared to the monoterpene alcohols against HSV-1. The monoterpenes with the highest virucidal activity were identified to be alpha-pinene and alpha-terpineol (Astani et al. 2009). The mechanism behind the virucidal activity was suggested to be direct inactivation of free viral particles. However, the study concluded that more than isolated single monoterpenes, a mixture of monoterpenes are more effective and possessed lesser toxicity to host cells (Astani et al. 2009). This was further bolstered by another study which evidenced the virucidal property of a combination of monoterpenes obtained from (Zamora et al. 2016). The activity was tested against a human flavivirus West Nile virus. The results were positive both in vivo and in vitro. The underlying mechanism was predicted to be induced cell cycle arrest at G0 or G1 phase. This indicates that a mixture of monoterpenes could act as a better antiviral agent rather than a single monoterpene (Zamora et al. 2016). Recent studies have shown that triketone-terpene adducts also exert antiviral, antimicrobial and antitumor activity (Chen et al. 2017). These adducts are obtained from Myrtaceae as secondary metabolites in the form of sesquiterpenes called myrtucomvalones A, B, and C. The terpene adducts successfully inhibited the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Chen et al. 2017).",

Limonene is a bioactive food component found in citrus peels, orange peels, and several other citrus fruits (Jirtle et al. 1993). Studies have reported limonene to exhibit strong cancer inhibition activity both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism behind limonene activity is still under investigation. A study by Jirtle et al. (1993) reported that limonene acts through induction of transforming growth factor B-1 and mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptors (Jirtle et al. 1993). In contrast a study by Bishayee and Rabi 2009) suggested that limonene eliminates cancer cells by induction of apoptosis (Bishayee and Rabi 2009). Structural studies on limonene reported that they are lipophilic and have the tendency to be deposited in fatty tissues when administered orally. This indicates that limonene can act as an excellent chemopreventive drug for cancer as it can be deposited in the body (Miller et al. 2010). Another study in 2013 concluded that limonene acts by suppressing the expression of breast tumor cyclin D1 (Miller et al. 2013). This lead to cell cycle arrest and mitigated proliferation of cancer cells in women with early stages of breast cancer (Miller et al. 2013). Recent study showed that limonene from pinecones can kill lung cancer cells in vitro by apoptotic mechanism that is activated through caspase-3 pathway (Lee et al. 2017). These findings indicate a novel application of limonene towards fighting and preventing cancer. Not just limonene, but also its metabolite perillyl alcohol is also said to exhibit antitumor activity in pancreatic cell lines through apoptotic mechanisms (Sobral et al. 2014; Dalessio et al. 2014).",

Thymoquinone has been proved to be anticancerous against several cancers such as breast cancer, skin cancer, non\u2013small cell lung cancer, bile duct cancer, and brain cancer. The basic mechanisms underlying the cancer inhibition is apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Sobral et al. 2014; Khader and Eckl 2014). Most of the cancer related studies were performed using thermoquinone obtained from the N. sativa extracts. A 2012 study showed that thermoquinone can be obtained in larger amounts from the mint family, namely, Monarda didyma and Monarda media (Taborsky et al. 2012).

This study was focused on non\u2013insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 2), and it proved that terpenes along with few other secondary metabolites such as alkaloids and flavonoids exhibit antidiabetic potential (Jung et al. 2006).",

            "text": "The most promising terpene compound for treating diabetes is called andrographolide which is a diterpenoid lactone (Brahmachari 2017). This compound forms the major component of the leaves of the small herbaceous plant . A. paniculata is an Asian plant that has already been reported to be used in traditional medicines for its therapeutic nature (Brahmachari 2017). The terpenoid acts by reducing the plasma glucose and increasing the utilization of glucose by the body in diabetes mellitus rats (Gupta et al. 2008). The actual mechanism by how it does this is it activates the alpha-adrenoreceptors to increase the release of an opioid peptide beta-endomorphin (Brahmachari 2017) which is reported to be secreted in low amounts in diabetic rats (Forman et al. 1985). This increased secretion in turn activates the opioid \u03bc-receptors. These receptors can effectively curb the hepatic gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis from non-carbohydrate precursors) and elevate the utilization of glucose by muscles. Finally, this results in a reduced plasma glucose concentration (Brahmachari 2017). Andrographolide is also observed to prevent the secondary complications of diabetes such as diabetic retinopathy, a condition that will lead to blindness (Brahmachari 2017). It significantly weakens the retinal angiogenesis and inflammation during the development of the disease (Brahmachari 2017). Moreover, it can also fix the impaired or extended estrous cycle in diabetic rats (Reyes et al. 2006). Andrographolide was orally administered in all the above studies. This indicates its efficiency for being used as a lead molecule in the future drugs designed for treating diabetes mellitus.",

It exhibits high antidiabetic property and acts by quashing the oxidative stress and inflammation. By regulating the polyol pathway, it can also reduce the plasma glucose and levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (Nabavi et al. 2015). Moreover, curcumin is also reported to activate the enzymes present in the liver that are essential for glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and lipid metabolism (Zhang et al. 2013). Alike andrographolide, curcumin is also reported to reduce the complications of diabetes (Nabavi et al. 2015), for example, liver disorder which is a common manifestation of diabetes type 2 (Zhang et al. 2013). Curcumin treats these disorders by reducing the liver weight and lipid peroxidation products. Further, it is also reported to normalize the levels of fetuin-A in serum that contributes to insulin resistance and fatty liver in diabetic rats (Zhang et al. 2013). Other complications that can be attenuated by curcumin include diabetes associated\u2014retinopathy, microangiopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy (Zhang et al. 2013). These findings confirm that curcumin is likely to be used in the future for diabetes treatment.",

It is hitting both the developed and developing countries. Depression can pave way to various health issues from alcoholism to heart diseases (Holden 2000). It is also said to increase the rate of mortality significantly in breast cancer patients (Hjerl et al. 2003). Moreover, depression immobilizes its victims thereby leading to economic loss (Holden 2000). By analyzing the social and economic burdens caused by depression, researchers have stepped out towards finding novel stress-relieving drugs. Synthetic drugs have serious side-effects and unintended interactions with the body that negatively affects the treatment outcome (Jawaid et al. 2011). Hence this necessitated the need for natural drugs. Terpenes serves as one of the most relevant bioactive compound for treating depression and therefore can open doors for designing natural or synthetic antidepressant drugs (Bahramsoltani et al. 2015).",

They were discovered from the extracts of medicinal plants and and flowers of lavender (Appleton 2012; Guzm\u00e1n-Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2012; Guadarrama-Cruz et al. 2008). These monoterpenes act by interacting with the 5HT1A receptors of the serotonergic pathway. Serotonins are important in the fact that their release and re-uptake levels can be altered to overcome stress (Chaouloff 2000; Guzm\u00e1n-Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2012). They also interact with adrenergic receptors of the body that play a major role in stress-induced behavioral changes (Pandey et al. 1995; Guzm\u00e1n-Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2015). Another interesting finding is the interaction of beta-pinene with dopaminergic receptors namely D1 receptors. This is the mechanism followed by most of the antidepressant drugs available in the market (Guzm\u00e1n-Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2015). A more interesting study would be to examine the beta-pinene and linalool efficiency through inhalation tests. This is because these monoterpenes are aromatic compounds that generally have an enhanced activity when inhaled as they can directly hit the central nervous system (Guzm\u00e1n Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2014).",

One striking example is beta-caryophyllene which was proved to ameliorate the depressive symptoms in mice (Bahi et al. 2014). The underlying mechanism of this compound is binding to a receptor called CB2 and activating it. CB2 is found in the brain and immune cells and plays a major role in regulating depressive-related disorders (Bahi et al. 2014). Thus beta-caryophyllene curbs depression by acting as a CB2 receptor agonist (Bahi et al. 2014).",

To be more specific, almost three-fourths of the plant-based drugs were created based on the knowledge of folk medicine (Table 15.4) (Efferth et al. 2008). Realizing this fact, western worlds are now turning back into old medicines and bioactive plant components to treat modern diseases (Efferth et al. 2007, 2008). This has boosted the export rates of Chinese medicinal products (based on traditional Chinese medicine) from China to other developed nations. Plants used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are being extensively studied for their secondary metabolites and their therapeutic properties (Efferth et al. 2007). One of the active principles of TCM products is terpenes (Liu and Jiang 2012). Due to their large availability and diversity, terpenes contribute the most to industrial and medicinal applications among all the secondary metabolites of plants (Zwenger and Basu 2008).",

The advantage of the latter is that concentration increases in tumor cells at a rate higher than that of the former (see footnote 13). The mechanism of anticancer activity is described as disruption of microtubules in the mitotic spindle, which will lead to incomplete chromosome separation thereby causing cell death (see footnote 13). In TCM and Ayurveda (herbal medicinal science mainly developed in India), healers used the twigs and barks of the tree to make a special kind of tea that can be given to patients suffering from cancer. However due to the slow growing nature of yew tree, paclitaxel nowadays is produced by coalescing the products of endophytic fungus that grows under the tree and the bark of the tree15,16 (Heinig et al. 2013).",

Pinene exhibits therapeutic properties such as anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, anticancer, and antibiotic properties.17,18 The source for pinene is Eucalyptus and other related coniferous trees (see footnote 17, Sartorelli et al. 2007) In olden days, the juice from the bark of eucalyptus was collected and mixed in water, milk or wine to be used as a drug (see footnote 17). Currently, they are extracted in the form of oil and sold in the form of syrups and lozenges.19 As eucalyptus oil contains several monoterpenes, a study analyzed the different constituents of eucalyptus oil for its effectiveness against bacteria. Here it was concluded that alpha-pinene is the best monoterpene with the highest inhibitory activity (Sartorelli et al. 2007). Recently scientists are studying another primary terpene in eucalyptus called cineole. Cineole is reported to improve the memory power, cognitive performance and attenuate the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in humans (see footnote 19; Moss and Oliver 2012). In addition, studies also showed that cineole is capable of improving the health of bronchitis patients by reducing their cough (Fischer and Dethlefsen 2013). This is in agreement with the fact that eucalyptus oil was used as an expectorant in Ayurvedic medicine.20 It is also known that local Brazilians used the Eucalyptus leaves to treat several human diseases such as cancer (Mathias et al. 2012). Further reports also suggest that eucalyptus oil has been involved in ancient Indian Ayurvedic and Greco-European medicine systems (see footnote 19).",

            "text": "Ayurveda is a popular medicine system which originated about 3000 years ago in India. The ayurvedic medicines are based on medicinal herbs, minerals, and metals (see footnote 16) along with diet regimes such as vegetarianism (Caldecott 2006). This system of medicine has proven to cure chronic disorders that could not be treated by western medicine (Sharma et al. 2007). Interestingly a lot of medicinal plants used by Ayurvedic practitioners owe their therapeutic property to their terpene contents. One good example is turmeric, a family of ginger which is regarded as \u201cGolden Goddess\u201d by medical practitioners (see footnote 18).21 It has numerous therapeutic properties that includes anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, antiseptic, antiplasmodial, astringent, digestive, diuretic, and many more (see footnote 18).22 Recently, scientists discovered that most of the turmeric\u2019s properties are laid out by the yellow-colored terpene\u2014curcumin (Kocaadam and \u015eanlier 2017). Studies are now trying to create curcumin analogues to improve the effects and activity of natural curcumin (Kocaadam and \u015eanlier 2017). Another popular example is clove which was used by both Ayurveda and TCM as a painkiller in dental cases. It was applied topically on cavities to relieve toothache and abdomen to treat digestive problems (Alqareer et al. 2006). The essential oil of clove is mostly composed of eugenol, a bioactive terpene that is responsible for clove\u2019s aroma (Alqareer et al. 2006). Eugenol by itself is said to enhance the blood circulation in the body and improve metabolism (see footnote 22). Thus, based on the above data we can conclude that various terpenes have been in use even before their discoveries by modern science, due to their amazing medicinal properties. A schematic summary of different terpenes and their medicinal uses, that we discussed, is provided below in Fig. 15.1.",
