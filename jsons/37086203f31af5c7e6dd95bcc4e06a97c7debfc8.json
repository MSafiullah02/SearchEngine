He had RT-PCR for COVID-19 before his procedure, which he tested negative. The surgery was uneventful and he was discharged home three days later. He then presented to the acute OMFS oncall team 10 days later, complaining of general malaise and fever over two days. He also complained of symptoms of diarrhoea. He had a repeat swab for COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses. The tests were all negative. He was admitted overnight and an urgent CT PA was requested after a plain film xray suggest possible COVID-19 infection. The CT scan reported ground glass appearances bilaterally in his mid and lower zones of his lungs. As there was no clinical deterioration overnight, he was discharged the following day with antibiotics and instructions to self isolate for 7 days. However, he was readmitted the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f following day as he was struggling with shortness of breath when moving and eating. He was admitted to ITU with a type 1 respiratory failure. Further COVID-19 swabs remain negative. He had a COVID blood panel taken which showed a tranferrin level of 821, IL6 223.7 and a trop 8 which although not specific for COVID is typical of the secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis syndrome seen in COVID-19 and acute respiratory syndromes. This consist of an unremitting fever, cytopaenias, hyperferrintinaemis and an elevated cytocyne profile. 3 Sadly as this letter is written, he currently remains ventilated in ITU. We have since found that patients within his bay where he was admitted for his surgery have also been poorly and tested positive for COVID-19.
