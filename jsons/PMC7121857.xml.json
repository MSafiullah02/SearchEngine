This scientific problem poses one of the most difficult challenges for society today (Wilcox and Colwell 2005). EID are diseases that have recently increased in incidence or in geographic or host range (e.g., tuberculosis, cholera, malaria, dengue fever), and diseases caused by new pathogens and new variants assigned to known pathogens (e.g., HIV, SARS, Nipah virus, and avian influenza) (Morse 2005). Wilcox and Gubler (2005) and Wilcox and Colwell (2005) argue that transformations in ecological systems caused by multifaceted interactions with anthropogenic environmental changes such as urbanization, agricultural transformations, and natural habitat alterations produce feedbacks that affect natural communities and ultimately their pathogens, animal host, and human populations. These altered \u201chost-pathogen\u201d relationships facilitate pathogen spillover into \u201cnew\u201d hosts, rapid adaptations by pathogens, more frequent generation of novel pathogen variants that result in new and reemerging infectious diseases, as well as range expansion and increasing epidemic intensity and frequency of existing diseases.",

This is a novel way of looking at HPAI and other health risks like it, suggesting these risks are not an accident of time and place, but rather are the product of the modernization and urbanization transitions.",

The emergence of the HPAI was first reported in Vietnam at the end of 2003 (Delquigny et al. 2004). Three major epidemic waves of HPAI have occurred in poultry, resulting in 45 million birds culled between December 2003 and August 2005, leading to a 0.5 % reduction in GDP in 2004. As of 2012, a total of 123 confirmed human cases and 61 deaths were recorded (World Health Organization 2012). The country has attempted to control the infection through massive, repeated vaccination campaigns in combination with other control measures (Gilbert et al. 2008a). Vietnam is a particularly useful country to examine development transitions and their associated environmental transformations because these processes are occurring both exceptionally rapidly and simultaneously as traditional agricultural lands are converted to intensified commercial farming or reshaped into urban settlements to meet the needs of the growing population attracted to cities for emerging job opportunities (Douglass et al. 2002; Spencer 2007). If development transitions do pose new challenges to governance, and in particular environmental health challenges, then one would expect to see more of these types of problems in transitional agricultural or peri-urban areas as distinct from both predominately urban and rural areas.",

Parallel to this, in biological science a re-envisioning has occurred in which nature is no longer seen as consisting of balanced ecological systems made up of relatively linear processes. Rather, natural systems are now seen as hierarchical, self-organized, non-equilibrial and non-linear systems in which emerging diseases can themselves be seen as \u201cemerging properties\u201d of these CAS (Levin 1999). The traditional conception of the ecosystem, a fundamental paradigm in the ecological sciences, has thus been overturned (O\u2019Neill 2001).",

Moreover, nearly all emerging diseases are vector borne or zoonotic (i.e., maintained in natural host-pathogen cycles that \u201cspill over\u201d to humans) (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005). They, or their immediate progenitors, exist as part of naturally co-evolved host-parasite complexes embedded within ecosystems, whose dynamics normally include non-linear, cross-scale behavior (Horwitz and Wilcox 2005). Based largely on complexity theory, social ecological systems and resilience (SESR) theory was developed to account for the non-linear dynamic behavior of CNH systems that result from intervention in \u201cmanaged\u201d ecosystems that unwittingly lead to unexpected and sometimes catastrophic outcomes, including disease re-emergence.",

            "text": "Holling (1973) introduced the concept of resilience into the ecological literature as a way of understanding nonlinear dynamics, such as the processes by which ecosystems maintain themselves in the face of change. In a resilient forest ecosystem, for example, four phases of change repeat themselves again and again. The first two phases, exploitation (the establishment of pioneering species) and conservation (the consolidation of nutrients and biomass), lead to an old growth forest or a climax community. But this climax community invites environmental disturbances such as fire or disease, and is more susceptible to disturbances than non-climax forests. When surprise or change occurs, the accumulated capital is suddenly released producing other kinds of opportunity, termed creative destruction. Release, a very rapid stage, is followed by reorganization in which, for example, nutrients released from the trees by fire will be fixed in other parts of the ecosystem as the renewal of the forest starts again (Berkes et al. 2003). Holling suggested that human societies also reproduce and reinvent in the process of cyclic transformations; he writes: \u201cThe bewildering, entrancing, unpredictable nature of nature and people, the richness, diversity and changeability of life come from the evolutionary dance generated by cycles of growth, collapse, reorganization, renewal and re-establishment\u201d (Holling 2003: xv).",

            "text": "Several social science theories relevant to the notion of types of development transitions are also relevant to both the Wilcox-Gubler-Colwell hypothesis and Holling\u2019s resilience theory. Our starting point is the theory of the Environmental Kuznet\u2019s Curve (EKC) from the discipline of development economics. Nobel Prize winner Simon Kuznets proposed that with respect to inequality, economic development is not linear but rather an inverted \u2018u\u2019 shape; economic development is a transition from an initial state of relative equality to an end state also of relative equality, but in the midst of economic development nation-states display high levels of economic inequality (line C in Fig. 5.1 is a Kuznets curve). While various scholars have shown that Kuznets curves are not universally applicable (see Park et al. 2007), Kuznets curves have become a simple but powerful method for empirically testing hypotheses about transitional states. The EKC hypothesizes that certain indicators of environmental degradation tend to get worse as modern economic growth occurs until average income reaches a certain point over the course of development (Grossman and Krueger 1995). Urban air pollution and deforestation have been cited as examples of environmental quality variables that follow the EKC. Recent empirical work has applied this understanding to the issue of HPAI (Spencer 2013), indicating that disease occurrence may be most likely where settlements are undergoing the most intense transitions. Such evidence suggests that a deeper understanding of \u201ctransition\u201d is warranted.\n\n",

            "text": "While some environmental quality indicators such as landfills and biodiversity do not seem to follow the EKC, supporters of the theory have argued that this may be more to do with issues of scale. Traditionally, most of the empirical work on EKC has been based on inter-country analysis of cross-sectional data. Often global regions (groups of countries) have been the unit of analysis. Most commonly, the metrics chosen for the predictor variable have been Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or GDP per capita, often adjusted by purchasing power parity or the Human Development Index (HDI). To address the scale issue we are examining whether the EKC is valid at the lowest level of government administration\u2013the commune or municipal ward\u2014for the entire country of Vietnam using readily available census data. The outcome variable is HPAI in domestic poultry. We are faced with the challenge that at the commune/ward level metrics such as GDP or HDI are not valid or are difficult to measure (e.g., because data are not available). Furthermore, using a binomial variable\u2014whether a place is rural or urban (as classified by the government) has two problems: (1) one cannot test the non-linearity of the curve and (2) it contradicts our fundamental premise that a significant number of places are not easily classifiable as being either rural or urban. Thus, we are forced to find a new metric reflecting development, which is ordinal with at least three levels. The \u201curbanicity\u201d method from the field of urban geography is useful for classifying place (Allender et al. 2008; Dahly and Adair 2007; McDade and Adair 2001; Vlahov and Galea 2002). Though most of the urbanicity metrics in the literature are continuous scale metrics, we adapt the principles to create an ordinal scale metric.",

This categorization is based on the premise that the major environmental causes of traditional diseases are problems at the household level (e.g., water, sanitation, food availability and quality, ventilation and indoor air pollution). As these are addressed during development there is an increase in the relative importance of the major environmental causes of more modern diseases which operate at the community level (i.e., urban air quality, occupational hazards, toxic chemicals, and motorization). As these are addressed in richer societies a further transition occurs to increase the importance of environmental hazards at the global level (e.g., global warming, land-use change) (Holdren and Smith 2000; McGranahan et al. 2000; Smith and Akbar 2003).",

A forest transition occurs when an initial surge in economic activity spurs deforestation, but as economic activity continues to intensify and cities grow larger, a \u2018turnaround\u2019 occurs, and deforestation gives way to reforestation. The agrarian transition has been defined as a number of inter-related phenomena. These include agricultural extensification and intensification (the amount of agricultural land is hypothesized to follow a Kuznets curve as extensification precedes intensification, but intensification then leads to the abandonment of marginal land); increased integration of production into market-based systems of exchange; heightened mobility of populations both within and across national borders as people are attracted to opportunities both within and outside of the agricultural sector; and processes of environmental change that reflect new human impacts and new valuations of resources (Akram-Lodhi 2004; Rigg and Vandergeest 2012; De Koninck 2004). The urbanization transition includes two parallel processes: population concentration (population is hypothesized to increase linearly) and the development of socio-physical infrastructure to manage the inevitable conflicts and problems associated with higher density living (infrastructure is hypothesized to increase linearly). The urban transition in developing countries describes societies that have rapidly changed from rural to urban forms of social and physical organization in relatively short time periods (Douglass 2000; Montgomery et al. 2004) such as those found in Southeast Asia.",

A better understanding of the relationship between development transitions and EID is critical for improving our ability to predict and respond to EID. This is particularly true in Vietnam where government policies have facilitated what can broadly be called a \u201ctransition to the market\u201d (Arkadie and Mallon 2003; De Vylder 1990; Fforde and Vylder 1996). Economic policies have driven changes in the built environment that have created new ecological health risks (Oliveira et al. 2004; Smith 1997), migration to cities has simultaneously uprooted residents from local social networks and placed them into new neighborhood associations, water user-groups, and other forms of social organization (Crane 1994; Spencer 2007). These new socio-physical ecologies present new challenges that, in turn, require new forms of social organization and governance, many of which do not yet exist, to provide basic services such as water and sanitation, education, housing, and public health.",

            "text": "A final social science perspective that has received little attention to date in the developing world relates to theories of behavioral decision making and perceptions of risk. This field draws primarily from economics, psychology, philosophy, anthropology, and cognitive science. Researchers have developed tools such as the Social Amplification of Risk Framework (Kasperson et al. 2003; Pidgeon et al. 2003) to describe and explain the societal processing of risk signals, but tests of such frameworks are rare because of the difficulty in predicting when risk amplification conditions are likely to occur (Frewer et al. 2002). A central insight of decision theory is that risk responses are based on socially constructed perceptions of risk. That is, risk means different things to different people; it cannot be measured independent of our minds and cultures. People prioritize risks in different ways, depending on their beliefs about the need to try to reduce a risk (Douglas and Wildavsky 1982; Hofstede 1984; Park et al. 2007). Research conducted in the developed world suggests that perceived risk is related strongly to feelings of control and trust (Slovic 2000). Some authors suggest that people perceive low risk during modernization because they feel they are in control of technology, nature, or society and that regulatory authorities can be trusted (Bauman 1992; Beck 1999; Giddens 1992). Over time, however, perceived risk increases as feelings of control and trust are eroded. Some people will respond swiftly and comprehensively to a risk event and others will respond more slowly, depending on a range of psychological and socio-cultural variables and environmental conditions. However, the relative importance of various elements in CNH systems (i.e., socio-ecological and socio-psychological factors) in determining perceptions of and responses to the risk of EID in rapidly developing societies has not been examined.",

Qualitative interviews and focus groups permit an in-depth exploration of risk perceptions and responses, allowing participants to describe beliefs and experiences in their own words, rather than as a choice between predetermined survey responses (Pope and Mays 1995). These methods are useful in defining the range and variability of conceptualizations of risks such as disease outbreaks and how they might relate to environmental change (O\u2019Brien 1993). Quantitative methods (e.g., decision analysis, process tracing, surveys) are more readily applied with larger samples and allow precise measurement of the information integration strategies decision makers use to determine their risk response. Applied to the problem of understanding the relationship between modernization and EID, we can test whether variation in individuals\u2019 risk responses is related to environmental change as represented in our degree of modernization metric.",

Simultaneously, rapid urban and peri-urban development in these countries has often been accompanied by more refuse, standing water, and animals in and around homes that have been correlated with environmental health risks (e.g., Graham et al. 2004). With respect to HPAI, expansion of the urban fringe has placed a larger proportion of the human population in contact with formerly dispersed farm environments that include potentially infected poultry and swine populations. Such urban\u2013rural interfaces have been hotspots of other infectious diseases such as leishmaniasis (Oliveira et al. 2004).",

(2006, 2007) showed that the interaction of poultry and particularly domestic duck populations within the rice paddy production system was as an important factor for the maintenance and spread of HPAI virus in Thailand. Pfeiffer et al. (2007) showed that rice paddy production intensity and density of domestic chickens and water birds were also associated with a higher risk of HPAI outbreaks in Vietnam, lending support to the rice-duck-chicken hypothesis. The same study showed that increased distance from high density human population areas consistently decreased HPAI risk (Pfeiffer et al. 2007). The study finds support for the hypothesis of \u201cthe presence of a fairly widespread infection reservoir in Vietnam \u2026, possibly in domestic and wild water birds\u201d (Pfeiffer et al. 2007). Gilbert et al. (2008b) demonstrated that a few key factors such as human population density, rice cropping intensity, and to some extent poultry density, managed to explain a large proportion of the spatial variation in HPAI disease risk; the same study also notes that considerable variation remained unexplained, and suggests that other factors such as poultry production and marketing systems, agricultural seasonality, the potential for contacts between domestic and wild birds, and climatic and other conditions affecting the persistence of the virus in the environment should be considered. Fang et al. (2008) found the minimal distance to the nearest national highway, annual precipitation, and the interaction between minimal distance to the nearest lake and wetland, were important predictive environmental variables for the risk of HPAI in China. A study of post-vaccination outbreaks in southern Vietnam found poultry flock density, fraction of houses with electricity, rescaled Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, buffalo density and sweet potato yield to be significant risk factors (Henning et al. 2009).",

Vietnam\u2019s 1999 Census of Population and Housing provides counts of households by housing construction materials (traditional/temporary or modern), water supply (stream, rain, well, piped), and sanitation infrastructure (none, pit, composting, flush). Spencer converted each of these 4-category, ranked urbanization measures into four distinct measures of settlement \u201ccoherence\u201d. For each coherence measure, greater mixing (i.e. incoherence) of the four categories was set to center on a value of zero, with more \u201ctraditional\u201d settlement a mixture dominated by the least sophisticated (e.g. no toilet) of each response category valued at (\u22121), and the most \u201cmodern\u201d settlements a mixture dominated by the most sophisticated (e.g. running water) of each response category valued at (+1). Working at the district level, Spencer plotted these three coherence indices, as well as a composite index combining the three, against the probability that a district in any of Vietnam\u2019s provinces (including cities) had an outbreak of HPAI in 2004 or 2005. After accounting for a minimal threshold effect of development, Spencer (2013) found a distinct Kuznets relationship exists between settlement coherence and HPAI. In particular, the sanitation coherence index explained over one third of variance in outbreaks (R-square = 0.37, bivariate), and the water supply coherence index explained over half (R-square = 0.56, bivariate). Overall, the findings suggest that the urban infrastructure transition is associated with HPAI outbreaks in poultry and may be used as a general predictor of emerging infectious disease risk.",

We are developing transition indices for agricultural change and habitat alteration, plotting them against the probability of HPAI outbreak, and choosing the curve that best fits the data.

In Laos, Barennes et al. (2007) reported that protective behavior was more likely with higher levels of education, urban living, knowledge of HPAI, and owning poultry. Only one of the above studies (Figui\u00e9 and Fournier 2008) was conducted in Vietnam. No studies have examined the relative importance of socio-ecological variables (urbanization, agricultural change, habitat alteration) versus socio-psychological variables (efficacy, knowledge, affective response, risk avoidance, demographics) in determining perceptions of risk to the health of poultry.

Currently, however, there exists a gap in knowledge about the underlying mechanisms that explain variation in perceptions of the risk of EID and how these perceptions vary with social-ecological transition. Furthermore, most research on perceived risk has been done in democratic, Western countries, not in a context where there is tight state control of key institutions that interpret and disseminate disease risk information.

In Fig. 5.2, we present a model in which we hypothesize that outbreaks of HPAI in poultry are associated with variations in three latent constructs: (1) Urbanization, measured in terms of changes in quality of housing and drinking water supplies (Spencer 2013); proximity to cities (Pfeiffer et al. 2007) and major roads (Fang et al. 2008), and human population (Gilbert et al. 2008b); (2) Habitat Alteration, measured in terms of changes in wetlands (Fang et al. 2008; Gilbert et al. 2007), amount and diversity of natural water sources (Fang et al. 2008); changes in proximity to wetlands (Fang et al. 2008); and (3) Agricultural Change, measured in terms changes in terms of number and intensity of paddy fields (Gilbert et al. 2007, 2008b; Pfeiffer et al. 2007), and number of ducks and chickens (Gilbert et al. 2006, 2007, 2008b; Pfeiffer et al. 2007).\n\n",

Multiple regression analysis of these types of problems are subject to problems of interpretation that include covariances among interacting explanatory variables and an inability to assign unique explanatory capacity to individual factors (Grace and Bollen 2005; Laughlin and Abella 2007). To avoid these problems, techniques such as structural equation modeling (SEM) may be most useful. SEM allows researchers to theorize about why explanatory variables are correlated and to build directional relationships into their models of systems. Explanatory variables are often correlated because they have a common cause or because one factor influences the other (Laughlin and Abella 2007; Shipley 2000). These situations are common in observation studies of complex systems. Consequently a systems approach to the analysis and interpretation of composition in this CNH system may be optimal for explaining where driving forces interact to produce observed patterns of bird deaths across the landscape.",

The next step in the process is to realize that we are creating a comparative rather than an absolute metric of modernization. Even though the metric helps in the comparative assessment of the level of modernization, there is still a need to validate it based on ground-truthing. So then we use a multi-disciplinary approach to ground truthing\u2014walk through field surveys, random ground-level photographs, satellite imagery, commune data archives\u2014to ensure that our classification was at least accurate on an ordinal scale.",
