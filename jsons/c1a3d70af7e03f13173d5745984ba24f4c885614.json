            "text": "Most of the species in this group are highly polyphagous. Hosts include most pome and stone fruits, citrus, grape, Rzrbus and many tropical fruits. Vegetables with fleshy fruits may also be hosts, including cucurbits. solanaceous plants and some legumes. Each species has a different range of preferred hosts though some are so similar that they may be ecological homologues (I 8). Host lists are however difficult to interpret because one species may displace another sympatric species from the latter's preferred host ( 14). (12, 26) Rhagoletis ponionella overwinters as a puparium in the soil. The emergence of the flies may be spread over 8 weeks. Accumulated temperatures have been used to predict emergence dates in Canada and the USA (30.36). In Nova Scotia, the first flies usually appear in early July and peak numbers are reached in late July or early August. Part of the population spends two winters in the puparium : these flies emerge late, contributing to the prolonged emergence pcriod. The eggs are laid singly in punctures made in the skin of the apple by the ovipositor of the female. Eggs hatch in 3 to 5 days at 2 5 O C in the laboratory, and in 5 to 10 days in the field. The larvae bore through the flesh of the apple and many larvae can develop in one fruit. Larvae develop slowly in green fruit and usually complete their development after the fruit has fallen from the tree. The puparia are formed 5-7 cm down in the soil. There is a partial second generation of flies in late autumn from larvae developing in apples that mature very early. The life cycles of the other species in Group I are very similar to those of R. pornoriella though their emergence periods are usually shorter. The emergence of R . indtyerens in Canada has been estimated from accumulated temperatures (1).",

The period is usually shorter in soft-fleshed fruits but may be lengthened by overcrowding. The larvae leave the fruit when fully grown and pupate in the soil.

There are two types of injury to apple fruits. one by the adults and the other by the larvae. Damage by both adults and larvae allows infection by organisms causing rots. especially the bacterium Pseirdonzorras meloplirlrora Allen & Riker. which is closely associated with all stages of R . poiitoriella. The oviposition punctures are small but, when numerous, they can result in distortion and down-grading of the fruit. Damage by larvae hecomes visible as the fruit ripens and heavily infested fruit is unsaleable. Infestation of host fruits by the species feeding on cherry and Ribes causes down-grading. Epoclzra ciiimdeiisis can severely limit the production of Ribes fruits unless controlled ( I 6). Larval feeding by R. corizpleta and R . siruiVs in developing walnuts results in stained and unmarketable nuts (29) . G l~p 2 (3-9, 18) DW~IS iry.~iii was reported as a serious pest in New South Wales as long ago as 1852 (27) . It attacks a wide range of top and soft fruit as well as tomatoes. Larval damage renders the fruit unsaleable. In general the trypetid fruit flies are major pests of fruit and vegetables in the tropics and sub-tropics. Large sums of money have been spent to prevent their introduction into uninfested areas and on their control, particularly on produce for export.",
