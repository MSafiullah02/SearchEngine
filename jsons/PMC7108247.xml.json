Molecular diagnostics, which is globally the current standard technology, overcomes these limitations.4 The majority of molecular approaches to influenza viruses detection are based upon real-time reverse-transcription PCR targeting the segment encoding the conserved matrix protein (M) gene segment.5 Downstream assays can be used to type influenza A or B or further subtype influenza A.",
