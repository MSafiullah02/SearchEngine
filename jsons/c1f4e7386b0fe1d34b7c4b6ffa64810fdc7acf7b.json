However, there are still many diseases that are caused by infectious agents for which vaccines are not available. Our increasing ability to manipulate the immune system offers hope that, in the future, at least some of these infections may be prevented by vaccination. A surprising recent development is the use of vaccine technology to test whether a range of other generally non-communicable diseases can be prevented (or at least controlled) in this way. Investigation of these diseases is still mainly at the experimental level, however the list includes different types of cancers, allergies, drug addiction and neurodegenerative diseases.

It continued during the nineteenth century with the introduction of several more vaccines to control some viral and bacterial infections, but the major contributions occurred in the twentieth century. 1 Over 70 different infectious agents commonly cause disease in humans. Nearly all of these have been (or are now) the target of vaccine development. Currently, there are over 30 registered individual vaccines, approximately half of which are commonly used, mainly to prevent childhood infections and especially in many developed countries. Approximately one dozen candidate vaccines to prevent other diseases have passed stage 2 clinical trials. 2, 3 ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES Approximately 30 years ago, there was some concern about the future of vaccine technology because the number of major manufacturers was declining. However, with the advent of new technologies -especially biotechnology, which saw the start up of many new small companies -the ability to manipulate immune responses and the increasing evidence of the efficacy of many of the new vaccines became apparent and the outlook changed. Table 1 lists the current vaccines and indicates the type of preparation. This varies from live, attenuated viruses and bacteria to subunits and toxoids. Some countries have kept records of vaccine efficacy based on the changing incidence of some common childhood diseases; in the USA, data from as far back as 1912 are especially impressive. The incidence of disease during an epidemic some years before the vaccine became available has been compared with the incidence in the late 1990s, some years after the vaccine became available. The drop in incidence was: (i) 100% for indigenous poliomyelitis, (ii) >99% for diphtheria and measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and (iii) >97% for tetanus. 4, 5 Two or three doses of many vaccines are needed to achieve maximum protection. 4 Although many vaccines can give sideeffects, the great majority are minor and claims to the contrary are usually wrong. For example, claims that the MMR vaccine causes inflammatory bowel disease and autism have not been substantiated in at least 10 epidemiological studies. 4 The global eradication of smallpox, achieved in 1977 and declared in 1980, is rightly regarded as one of the greatest public health achievements of all time. In the drive to globally eradicate poliomyelitis, three major regions -the Americas, Europe and the Western Pacific -have now been declared free of endemic disease. However, global eradication is proving to be more difficult due, in part, to the occurrence of revertent strains, and the failure in some countries to maintain a high level of vaccination. In addition, prevention of transmission of that highly infectious agent has been achieved in the USA, Canada and Finland following the adoption of a two-dose schedule for measles vaccination.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 332, "end": 333, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 779, "end": 781, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 782, "end": 783, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1929, "end": 1931, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1932, "end": 1933, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2012, "end": 2013, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2288, "end": 2289, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1239, "end": 1246, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Another remarkable success in the last decade or so has been the development of conjugate vaccines.

It also took a long time for the medical community to take advantage of the finding.

There is, therefore, a strong need to devise improved methods for developing vaccines to the many difficult, and as yet unconquered, infectious agents.

The two systems are intimately connected.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "How do vaccines work?"}, {"text": "The innate system detects 'danger', and can come into operation within minutes or hours of an infection occurring. It consists of a variety of different cell types. Some cells have receptors that recognize common bacterial products such as endotoxins which, if present, activate the cell to produce and secrete factors harmful to the invader. Other secreted factors include cytokines, such as interferons, and chemokines, which activate and influence the traffic of other cells. Two cell types -dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages -are a critical link between the innate and adaptive systems because they take up foreign material, process it and express it at the cell surface in a form recognized by T lymphocytes. DCs are called the 'professional' antigen-presenting cells. They have receptors (toll-like receptors), which recognize foreign material such as bacterial DNA (but not vertebrate DNA), and this recognition results in the activation and maturation of the DC. 13 The adaptive system takes a few days (and sometimes weeks) to be activated and become effective. Lymphocytes (cells found in the lymph) characterize the adaptive system. There are two types of lymphocytes: (i) B lymphocytes, which make and secrete antibodies and (ii) T lymphocytes, which have several roles. There are two T-cell subclasses, characterized by the cellular differentiation markers (CD4 and CD8). There are two types of CD4+ T-cells: (i) Th-1 and (ii) Th-2. Th-2 cells secrete a number of cytokines (interleukins), whose major task is to help B cells to differentiate and make different classes of antibodies (IgA, IgE and most subclasses of IgG). These cells primarily have a regulatory role ( Table 2) . Th-1 cells help B cells to make some subclasses of IgG antibodies, however they also secrete a pattern of cytokines which activate a range of other cells, such as macrophages. They are also the major cell type mediating delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. Thus, they display both regulatory and effector functions. A crucial question that is receiving more attention is what determines the balance between these two responses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 975, "end": 977, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1687, "end": 1695, "text": "Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "How do vaccines work?"}, {"text": "In contrast, CD8+ T cells are called cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) or killer T cells, because they recognize and cause the lysis of cells infected by viruses, bacteria or parasites. Thus, they act as auditors of the body; seeking out and destroying 'dangerous' (i.e. infected) cells. In some situations, Th1-type cells also help in the differentiation and maturation of CTL (Table 2) . 14 A unique property of lymphocytes is that each B cell makes antibodies and each T cell has antigen receptors (TCR) of a single specificity. Only a few thousand B cells make antibody molecules (and T cells) of exactly the same specificity. However, because there are more than a billion different possible specificities, there are a lot of lymphocytes in the body. Following an infection, the appropriate T and B cells are activated, mature and replicate to form many progeny cells, most of which die after the infection is cleared. However, pools of memory cells with those specificities are formed and persist. Over time, B memory cells are activated by contacting retained foreign antigen and become antibody-secreting cells (ASC) or new memory cells. The net result is that, after an infection or immunisation/ vaccination, a specific antibody will be continually made for long periods, sometimes many years (decades). Pools of memory T cells are also made following an infection/ immunisation, however these persist as such until there is a second exposure to the same (or very similar) infectious agent, when they may rapidly differentiate to a fully effector state.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 386, "end": 388, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 374, "end": 383, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "How do vaccines work?"}, {"text": "The sequence of appearance of immune cells following an infection is: (i) regulatory T cells, (ii) effector T cells (usually CTL) and, finally, (iii) ASC.

However, the antibody approach has not been successful to date with a growing number of agents, especially those displaying considerable antigenic variation like HIV-1. Thus, the amino acids in up to 30% of the envelope antigen (gp120) of HIV may vary, and as many as 10 different amino acids may be found at a few sites in one segment (the V3 loop of gp120 in isolates). After almost 20 years of intensive research, there are now available a few high titre (monoclonal) antibody preparations which neutralize the infectivity of a wide range of antigenically different HIV-1 field isolates. One of these (IgG1b12) prevents the binding of the virus to the main cellular receptor (CD4). The three-dimensional structure of the antibody's CD4 binding site has been determined 15 and this may allow the synthesis of a compound that mimics this critical segment of gp120.

Cells infected with the chimeric virus produced the antigen(s) coded for by the inserted DNA. Immunisation of hosts with the chimeric virus induced strong antibody and T cell (including CTL) responses and protected against a challenge by the infectious agent that was the source of the foreign DNA. Table 3 lists the infectious agents that are more frequently used experimentally as vectors. The additional insertion of DNA coding for the interleukins (IL-4 or IL-12) into the vector induced a very strong antibody or effector T cell response, respectively. However, concern was sparked when it was shown that inclusion of DNA coding for IL-4 into ectromelia (mouse pox) virus down-regulated CTL production to such an extent that infection of mice that were normally genetically resistant to ectromelia with this virus caused high mortality.

The chimeric plasmids are then injected intramuscularly, or used in much smaller amounts to coat tiny gold beads which are then injected intradermally using a 'gene gun'. The bacterial DNA component of these plasmids is recognized by receptors on the local dendritic (Langerhan's) cells as being foreign, and this initiates the activation and maturation of the cells. During transit of the cells to the draining lymph nodes, the foreign DNA is transcribed and the protein is processed for presentation to T cells in the node. When tested in mice, there was a surprisingly strong and persistent antibody and CMI response that protected against a challenge infection. Three gene gun injections of DNA coding for malaria parasite antigens to volunteers gave strong T cell responses, and eight of 14 recipients had CTL responses. 24 An improved immune response, for both CTL and antibody levels, has been obtained by adsorbing the chimeric plasmid DNA onto cationic poly (lactide-coglycolide) (PLG) microparticles before injection. 25 The PLG particles are biodegradable and biocompatible. To date, there is no evidence to suggest that immunising with DNA is harmful. For example, the injected DNA does not appear to integrate into the host cell genome which, if it occurred, might result in cancer. The next surprise was the finding that plasmids containing DNA from an infectious agent were particularly effective at priming the immune system. Immunising (priming) mice first with chimeric plasmids, followed by boosting with a chimeric poxvirus vector containing DNA coding for the same foreign antigen (influenza haemagglutinin), induced unusually high antibody titres. These were as much as 50-fold higher than those seen when two doses of the same construct were administered to mice. 26 This 'prime : boost' approach, as it is now termed, has been applied with success to several of difficult infectious agents in model systems. The main aim has been to generate strong T cell (especially CTL) responses so that a subsequent challenge infection is not prevented but is controlled and possibly cleared.

In each case, immunising against viral antigens should prevent tumour development. Early results are promising. Vaccination of infants in Taiwan with the hepatitis B virus vaccine specifically reduced the incidence of the liver cancer in 6-14 year old children by 50% and reduced the incidence of death due to this cancer by 70%. 29 Clinical trials of a candidate vaccine based on the antigen E7 (in the form of virus-like particles) of the papilloma virus type 16 have recently concluded. All 41 cases of new HPV16 infection occurred in the placebo group. 30 Based on this excellent result, a phase III trial is being initiated with a tetravalent vaccine (strains HPV16, 18, 6 and 11). The first two types are responsible for >50% of cervical cancer; the last two types are linked to 90% of genital warts cases. 31 In a clinical trial in China, an aggregate of the L1 antigen of HPV type 6 and HPV type 11 induced strong antibody responses and caused complete regression of genital warts in 22 of 33 subjects. 32 However, there are at least 13 other HPV types that are considered carcinogenic, 33 so much work lies ahead to develop a more broadly protective vaccine. In addition, it now seems likely that vaccine formulations will be forthcoming, which control some of the malignancies caused by Epstein-Barr virus infections such as Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 34 Control of spontaneous tumours by immunotherapy has proved to be a greater challenge. In 1930, Burnet proposed the concept of 'immunosurveillance' in which he postulated that the immune system would recognize many newly developing malignant cells as foreign, and would destroy them. 35 Tumours that did arise had escaped such recognition by, for example, mutation. Experiments with model systems that were available at the time -such as the 'nude' mouse (having few T cells) -did not support this concept, however it recently became possible to completely inactivate the murine adaptive system. When exposed to carcinogens, such mice develop more tumours than control mice, 36 thus substantiating Burnet's concept. However, this means that the spontaneous tumours that occur naturally are 'immunoselected' to resist an immunotherapeutic attack. Nevertheless, there are some encouraging findings based on developing strong CTL responses to tumour-associated antigens. In small clinical trials in which strong CTL responses to melanoma antigens were induced, partial or complete remissions were achieved in approximately \u226430% of participants. 37, 38 The next task is to discover why the cancers of most trial subjects failed to respond to this intervention, and to devise unique approaches to overcome such resistance. Combining two quite different approaches -such as immunotherapy and antiangiogenesis -could have a marked synergistic effect. Calreticulin (CRT), a transporter of peptides, enhances MHC class 1 expression and has an antiangiogenesis effect. Immunisation of immunocompromised mice with DNA coding for CRT fused to a tumour antigen (E7 protein of human papilloma virus -16) induced a greater reduction of tumour nodules compared to immunisation with DNA coding for the E7 protein alone. 39", "cite_spans": [{"start": 581, "end": 583, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 808, "end": 810, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1066, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1264, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1635, "end": 1637, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1921, "end": 1923, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2779, "end": 2782, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2783, "end": 2785, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cancer"}, {"text": "The incidence of autoimmune and allergic diseases in developed countries is increasing.

Thus, recovery from natural measles infection reduced childhood incidence of allergic reactions to house dust mites to half that seen in vaccinated children. 44 The neonatal human immune system has a 'Th-2 bias' which slowly changes to a mixed Th-2/Th-1 response. The tetanus-specific cytokine profile was found to be initially Th-2 strong following administration of the DaPT vaccine, however there was increasing IFN\u03b3 (a Th-1 cytokine) production over time (\u226418 months) in most infants.

A recent retrospective study has shown that children in Europe who live on farmsand are hence exposed to animal stables and farm (nonpasteurized) milk in the first year of life -had a greatly reduced risk of allergic diseases in later life. 46", "cite_spans": [{"start": 407, "end": 409, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 779, "end": 781, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1264, "end": 1266, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Autoimmune and allergic diseases"}, {"text": "Cocaine abuse is a major medical and social problem world-wide and has reached epidemic proportions in many countries, including the USA. Current methods of treatment that aim to use drugs to block the central neurochemical effects have had limited success in clinical trials and can cause unwanted side-effects. The idea of vaccinating to produce anticocaine antibody to bind free cocaine and so limit or prevent access of the free drug to the brain is attractive, because it should not cause any of the above side-effects. Two recent papers have reported findings that offer some hope that this might be achievable. In one case, a murine model of acute cocaine-induced locomotor activity was used. Mice were immunised with a cocaine derivative/protein conjugate, together with an adjuvant, and challenged several times with systemic cocaine. 47 On each occasion, there was significant reduction of cocaine psychoactive effects. Immunisation of monkeys with a cocaine/protein conjugate also decreased the neurochemical effect of the drug, with a direct relationship between the reduced magnitude of the effect and the serum antibody titre. 48 Similarly, clinical trials are underway to ascertain whether the antibody formed following vaccination of smokers with nicotine conjugated to cholera toxin induces antibodies that are sufficiently powerful to bind all free nicotine, and so prevent the drug from reaching the brain. 49 It is anticipated that this approach may work best initially for smokers who risk relapsing after quitting smoking.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 844, "end": 846, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1141, "end": 1143, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1426, "end": 1428, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Substance addiction"}, {"text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) are three neurodegenerative diseases in which changes in a brain protein can be fatal.

Transgenic mice expressing DNA coding for this protein develop a similar brain pathology and experience loss of memory. Early immunisation of transgenic mice with the protein prevented these changes from occurring; 50 a similar immunisation of the mice after the changes occurred largely 'reversed' the pathological damage. 51 Using a multiphoton microscope, images of the plaques can be seen in the transgenic mouse brains. Direct introduction of a fluorescein-labelled potent A\u03b242 antibody into such brains highlighted the deposited protein and showed that it was cleared in approximately 3 days. 52 After testing in a variety of animal models, a phase I clinical trial on patients with mild to moderate AD suggested that vaccination with this protein was safe.

The incidence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease -probably following exposure to BSE -is increasing, particularly in the United Kingdom. It is thought that interaction between the pathogenic prion protein (PrP Sc ) and the endogenous cellular prion protein (PrP C ) leads to the formation of prions, an infectious form of PrP Sc . Reagents binding to either PrP Sc or PrP C inhibit prion formation. 54 It has now been demonstrated that, when used to treat neuroblastoma cells infected with PrP Sc , antibody fragments specific for PrP C inhibit further PrP Sc formation in an antibody dose-dependent manner. 55 Furthermore, transgenic mice expressing an antiprion protein \u00b5 chain developed sustained antiprion antibody titres, which protected against the pathogenesis caused by prions. 56 A practical intervention procedure for humans is a long way off, however these early results are interesting.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 469, "end": 471, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 957, "end": 959, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1166, "end": 1168, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1346, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Neurodegenerative diseases"}, {"text": "Vaccination, particularly to prevent many common childhood infectious diseases, is one of the most impressive health achievements of the twentieth century.
