REACTing is also a single point-of-contact for international organisations to avoid duplication and absence of visibility of actions developed in France. In this context, REACTing establishes close cooperation with international organisations and consortia, in particular, the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Diseases Preparedness (known as GloPID-R in French) consortium, which coordinates health research funders to enhance the research response to emerging outbreaks of infectious disease, and also with the European Union, WHO, or the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).",

In less than 2 months, several projects (eg, diagnosis, treatment, vaccines, and social sciences) were proposed and rapidly launched, in Guinea in particular. Of note, this scientific programme was proposed to the political authorities and was included on the agenda of the French interministerial response to the epidemic with security, diplomatic, and health measures within the task force set up by the French Government.",

Given the threat for the neighbouring French territories, REACTing organised a meeting to define research needs in September, 2015. At that time, we decided to extend an existing descriptive and prognosis cohort of arbovirus infections in Martinique, Guadeloupe, and French Guiana, launched a few years ago,11 to Zika virus cases. In December, 2015, soon after the Brazilian authorities became aware of a possible association between neonatal microcephaly and Zika virus infection during pregnancy, REACTing organised a second meeting to address and reconsider key research issues, among which evidence of a potential causal association between microcephaly and Zika virus infection was clearly a priority. For this issue, we took advantage of retrospective studies using data collected during the Zika epidemic in French Polynesia to assess the association between neonatal microcephaly and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome with Zika virus infection.12 Additionally, we launched prospective large cohorts in the French territories in the Americas to evaluate the effect of Zika virus infection during pregnancy and in neonates. An international collaboration between French and European researchers and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ) in Brazil has also been established at the institutional level to address questions in the specialties of entomology and neuroscience.",

            "text": "REACTing has forged a new dynamic to face emergency situations and contribute to national and international public health decisions. However, we also faced difficulties in initiating and coordinating research in a sustained way. First, when confronted by a new epidemic, it is challenging to determine priorities for research. For example, during the Ebola epidemic, the decision to initiate research should have probably been made a few months earlier. We are currently working to establish a scale to assist us in deciding whether the need is urgent for research projects to be initiated. Although REACTing's original focus was on research preparation during peacetime, the past couple of years have not seen a break in global health crises, meaning that research was prepared during these crucial periods in a suboptimum context. Second, the research agenda continues even after the immediate public health crises, as illustrated by the examples of Ebola vaccine research or the cohorts of Ebola survivors. Third, several emerging infectious diseases might occur at the same time and challenge our capacity to mobilise resources to respond to several outbreaks in different countries. For example, with respect to the Zika virus epidemic, we should have perhaps initiated research coordination in 2014, when the epidemic occurred in French Polynesia. However, at that time, the Zika virus epidemic in French Polynesia and the beginning of the Ebola epidemic in west Africa overlapped. REACTing prioritised the Ebola epidemic when designing research activities. Finally, it is not easy to conduct research projects under an emergency flag for long periods and to keep the political and scientific commitment beyond the end of an epidemic threat. REACTing is highly dependent on our capacity to attract and convince researchers to reorient their priorities and to be involved in research targeting the emerging infectious diseases. This objective might be possible for the short term but as shown in the case of Ebola, it is more difficult in the long term. These are areas on which we should work in the future and for which we need additional resources.",

Pandemics are a neglected part of global security and are not contained by any borders.13 We need to continue the battle against emerging infectious diseases at a national and international level. It is crucial to create and reinforce international mechanisms for leading, coordinating, and providing resources for a global response to infectious disease crises.
