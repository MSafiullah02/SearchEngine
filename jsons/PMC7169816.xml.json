            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) is a highly contagious, deadly enteric viral disease in pigs with economically effects on pig production. The disease causes severe watery diarrhoea, followed by fatal dehydration, and a high mortality rate in neonatal piglets (Lee, Kim, & Lee, 2015). The causative agent, PED virus (PEDV), is a large, enveloped, single\u2010stranded, positive\u2010sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh, 1997; Gorbalenya, Enjuanes, Ziebuhr, & Snijder, 2006; Pensaert & Debouck, 1978; Saif, Pensaert, Sestack, Yeo, & Jung, 2012). The PEDV genome is approximately 28 kb in length with a 5\u2032 cap and 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail and consists of seven canonical coronaviral genes, including open reading frame (ORF) 3, in the following conserved order: 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR)\u2010ORF1a\u2010ORF1b\u2010S\u2010ORF3\u2010E\u2010M\u2010N\u20103\u2032 UTR (Kocherhans, Bridgen, Ackermann, & Tobler, 2001). The first two large ORFs, ORF1a and 1b, encompass the 5\u2032\u2010proximal two\u2010thirds of the genome and code for nonstructural proteins (nsps). ORF1a translation yields a replicase polyprotein (pp) 1a, whereas ORF1b is expressed by a \u22121 ribosomal frame shift that C\u2010terminally extends pp1a into pp1ab. These pp1a and pp1ab are proteolytically matured by internal viral proteases to generate 16 processing end\u2010products, named as nsp1\u201316. The remaining ORFs in the 3\u2032\u2010proximal region of the genome encode four canonical structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), as well as one accessory gene, ORF3 (Duarte et al., 1994; Kocherhans et al., 2001; Lai, Perlman, & Anderson, 2007; Lee, 2015; Saif et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea was first observed in feeder and fattening pigs in England in 1971 (Oldham, 1972) and caused widespread epidemics in multiple swine\u2010producing countries in Europe during the 1970s (Opriessnig, 2016). A marked decrease in acute PED epizootics occurred in Europe in the 1980s and 1990s, and only sporadic outbreaks have occurred in recent years (Opriessnig, 2016). In Asia, PED was first reported in 1982, and unlike in Europe, it has since posed a huge economic threat to the Asian pork industry (Chen et al., 2008; Kweon et al., 1993; Li et al., 2012; Puranaveja et al., 2009; Takahashi, Okada, & Ohshima, 1983). In May 2013, PED outbreaks suddenly appeared in the United States and swiftly spread across the nation, as well as to adjacent countries. This outbreak caused the death of more than 8 million newborn piglets in the United States alone during a 1\u2010year\u2010epidemic period, leading to annual losses in the range of $900 million to $1.8 billion (Langel, Paim, Lager, Vlasova, & Saif, 2016; Mole, 2013; Ojkic et al., 2015; Stevenson et al., 2013; Vlasova et al., 2014). The US emergent strain\u2010like viruses further reached East Asian countries, resulting in nationwide PED disasters (Lee, 2015; Lee & Lee, 2014; Lin et al., 2014; MAFF, 2018). During the 2013\u20132014 pandemics, PED rapidly swept across mainland South Korea and Jeju Island, killing hundreds of thousands of piglets in domestic herds (Lee & Lee, 2014, 2017; Lee & Lee, 2014). Since then, PED epizootics or enzootics have regionally occurred through provinces in South Korea with intensive swine industries. To investigate the diversity of PEDVs responsible for the ongoing outbreaks in South Korea, in this study, we determined the full\u2010length sequences of the S proteins of field isolates and complete genome sequences of representative strains identified throughout 2017. In addition, we isolated and serially propagated a KOR/KNU\u20101705/2017 strain and assessed the antigenic cross\u2010reactivity between 2014 and 2017 PEDV field isolates.",

Faecal samples were also diluted with PBS to 10% (wt/vol) suspensions. The suspensions were then vortexed and centrifuged for 10 min at 4,500\u00d7 g (Hanil Centrifuge FLETA5, Incheon, South Korea). The clarified supernatants were initially subjected to RT\u2010PCR using a TGE/PED Detection Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seongnam, South Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PEDV\u2010positive samples were filtered through a 0.22\u2010\u03bcm\u2010pore\u2010size syringe filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until subsequent sequencing analysis and virus isolation.",

Two overlapping cDNA fragments spanning the entire S gene of each isolate were amplified by RT\u2010PCR as described previously (Lee, Park, Kim, & Lee, 2010). The individual cDNA amplicons were gel\u2010purified, cloned into a pGEM\u2010T Easy Vector System (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced in both directions using two commercial vector\u2010specific T7 and SP6 primers and gene\u2010specific primers. The full\u2010length S sequences of 10 PEDV, designated KNU\u20101701 to \u20101710, were deposited in the GenBank database under the accession numbers shown in Figure 1a. In addition, the complete genomes of representative PEDV field strains were sequenced by the traditional Sanger method. Ten overlapping cDNA fragments spanning the entire genome of each virus strain were RT\u2010PCR\u2010amplified as described previously (Lee & Lee, 2014; Lee et al., 2015, 2017), and each PCR product was sequenced as described above. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genomes of individual isolates were determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) as described previously (Lee & Lee, 2013). General procedures for DNA manipulation and cloning were performed according to standard procedures (Sambrook & Russell, 2001). The complete genomic sequences of the 2017 viruses were deposited in the GenBank database under the accession numbers shown in Figure 1b.",

Based on the S gene sequences, therefore, PEDV can be genetically separated into two genogroup clusters, genogroup 1 (G1, classical and recombinant: low\u2010pathogenic) and genogroup 2 (G2, field epizootic or panzootic: high\u2010pathogenic), which are further divided into subgroups 1a and 1b as well as 2a and 2b (Lee, 2015; Lee & Lee, 2014). The complete sequences of the S genes of 10 isolates showed that seven strains were classified as G2b, sharing 98.1%\u201399.2% amino acid (aa) identity (11\u201326 aa differences) with the reference Korean G2b strain KNU\u2010141112, whereas the remaining three isolates belonged to G1b, exhibiting 98.7%\u201399.4% aa homology (8\u201317 aa differences) with the reference Korean G1b strain KNU\u20101406 (Table 1; Figure S1). In an interesting manner, the G1b virus S genes were well\u2010conserved, sharing 99.0%\u201399.7% aa identity with each other, whereas the 2017 G2b S genes were relatively variable, exhibiting 97.1%\u201399.8% aa homology with each other (Table 1). All 2017 G2b isolates possessed common genetic signatures of genogroup G2, namely S insertions\u2010deletions (S INDELs) comprising two notable 4\u2010aa and 1\u2010aa insertions at positions 55/56 and 135/136, respectively, and a unique 2\u2010aa deletion (DEL) at positions 160 and 161 within the N\u2010terminal hypervariable region of S compared to the prototype CV777 strain (Lee, 2015; Lee & Lee, 2014; Lee et al., 2010) (Figure S2). In a remarkable way, one isolate KNU\u20101710 was found to contain an additional 2\u2010aa S DEL at positions 137 and 138 in the S1 domain, which was completely absent in the other G1 and G2 isolates in GenBank (Figure S2). Thus, the S gene of KNU\u20101710 is 4,155 nucleotides (nt) in length encoding a 1384\u2010aa protein, which is 6\u2010nt (2\u2010aa) shorter than the homologous genes in most G2 strains. G1b strains are thought to arise from a recombination event between classical G1a and field epidemic G2 viruses, and their S genes consist of 4,152 nt encoding 1,383 aa residues identical to those of classical G1a strains. They showed typical genetic and phylogenetic features (no S INDELs compared to CV777 and different phylogenetic subgroup [G1b or G2] depending on the sequence of the S protein or whole\u2010genome) (Lee, 2015; Lee, Park, Shin, & Lee, 2014). All G1b isolates identified in this study equally contained the aforementioned S gene characteristics of G1b (Figure S2).",

In particular, a G2b\u2010like KNU\u20101705 strain contains a unique 39\u2010nt DEL at positions 3,322 and 3,360 located in the ORF1a region potentially encoding nsp3, which acts as a papain\u2010like protease (PLpro). This large ORF1a\u2010DEL pattern has been unprecedented in other G1b and G2b field strains reported in previous and current studies (Figure S3). No additional insertions or deletions were identified in the genomes of all 2017 G1b and G2b isolates. Except for the KNU\u20101710 and KNU\u20101705 strains with a notable DEL in S or ORF1a, respectively, the entire genomic sequences of the remaining five 2017 G2b strains were 28,038 nt in length, excluding the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail, while the 2017 G1b KNU\u20101702 genome is 28,029 nt long as reported previously (Lee & Lee, 2014; Lee, Park et al., 2014). The genome of G1b KNU\u20101702 shared high nucleotide homology (99.3%) with other complete G1b PEDV genomes in GenBank, showing the lowest nt difference (177\u2010nt) with the Korean G1b strain KNU\u20101406. Compared to the complete genome of the Korean prototype G2b strain KNU\u20101305, the genomes of the 2017 G2b strains had 103\u2013255\u2010nt differences (99.0%\u201399.6% homology) (Table S1).

Consistent with previous studies (Lee, 2015; Lee & Lee, 2014; Lee et al., 2015), phylogenetic analysis based on the PEDV S genes revealed clear separation among the G1a, G1b, G2a and G2b subgroups. All G2b strains identified in 2017 were grouped within the G2b clade; however, they were in different branches from the emergent US strains and past re\u2010emergent Korean field isolates (Figure 1a). The 2017 G1b isolates were most closely clustered together, forming an independent branch within the G1b subgroup. Furthermore, a phylogenetic tree subsequently reconstructed from the complete genome showed the same grouping structure as the S gene\u2010based tree (Figure 1b). As shown previously (Lee, 2015; Lee et al., 2015), the entire genome\u2010based phylogenetic tree revealed that the G1b strains including KNU\u20101702 were grouped within the G2 clade because of the similarity between the G1b and G2b genomes, except for the N\u2010terminal one\u2010third of the S gene.

One PEDV isolate designated as KNU\u20101705 was successfully isolated from the faeces of a naturally infected piglet from a commercial farm located in Chungnam Province obtained on December 19, 2017. KNU\u20101705 produced apparent CPEs typical of PEDV infection, such as cell fusion, syncytium and detachment, in infected Vero cells from passage 3 (P3) (Figure 2a). Virus propagation was confirmed by detecting PEDV antigens by IFA using a PEDV N protein\u2010specific MAb (CAVAC, Daejeon, South Korea). As shown in Figure 2a, distinct staining was distributed in the cytoplasm of typical syncytial cells. In addition, S glycoprotein gene sequencing revealed that the P10 isolate (KNU\u2010180117\u2010P10) contains one nucleotide change, resulting in a nonsynonymous mutation (Ser to Leu) at amino acid position 1,708, compared to the original faecal sample KNU\u20101705\u2010faeces. Growth kinetics analysis further indicated that KNU\u20101705 replicated efficiently in Vero cells, reaching a maximum titre of >105 TCID50/ml by 24 hr postinfection (hpi) (Figure 2b). Next, we tested sow antisera previously elicited by a PEDV G2b KNU\u2010141112 strain (Baek et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2015) to determine their cross\u2010neutralization ability against the contemporary KNU\u20101705 isolate (Figure 2c). In agreement with previous studies, the antisera were greatly effective in inhibiting KNU\u2010141112 infection with mean neutralizing antibody (NA) titres of 1:131. Similar to that, highly diluted antisera efficiently protect Vero cells infected with the recent KNU\u20101705 isolate with mean NA titres of 1:80, which were less than 1\u2010log2 lower but not significantly different compared to those against KNU\u2010141112. Taken together, our data indicate that the antisera cross\u2010reacted well between the homologous G2b field isolates, suggesting antigenic similarity between the 2014 and 2017 PEDV strains.",

Along with strict biosecurity, vaccination is a fundamental tool for managing and eradicating PEDV during epidemic or endemic outbreaks. Although G1a\u2010based vaccines against PEDV were developed and used to combat this disease in South Korea over the past decade, their efficacy in the field, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of their use, is continuously debated. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence suggests that their incomplete effectiveness may result from antigenic, genetic (>10% aa variation between respective S proteins) and phylogenetic (G1 versus G2) differences between vaccine and field epidemic strains (Lee et al., 2010; Lee & Lee, 2014; Oh et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2015; Lee, 2015). The advent of the 2013\u20132014 PEDV pandemic led to a breakthrough in the development of G2b\u2010based vaccines phenotypically and genotypically homologous to field strains responsible for global PED epidemics, and these G2b vaccines are currently applied to prevent PEDV in South Korea. Another important policy for controlling PEDV is to operate a monitoring and surveillance system (MOSS) to monitor genetic diversity among field isolates and surveil the emergence of novel variants in the field, which will contribute to preventing future outbreaks. To provide insight into the understanding of the current epidemiological status of PEDV in South Korea, the present study aimed to investigate the genetic, phylogenetic and antigenic characteristics of PEDVs responsible for regional outbreaks in South Korea in 2017.",

            "text": "Nucleotide sequencing analysis revealed that two different PEDV genotypes, low\u2010pathogenic G1b and high\u2010pathogenic G2b, caused regional outbreaks in South Korea, with the latter genotype more prevalent and associated with more serious and fatal clinical outcomes on domestic pig farms. The 2017 isolates exhibited less than 1% nucleotide sequence variations at the genome level with the 2013\u20132014 pandemic strains. However, field G2b isolates with nearly 2% amino acid sequence divergence compared to previous G2b strains at the S gene level were identified in the present study. Furthermore, mutations within the S protein were randomly and extensively distributed in the S1 and S2 regions among the 2017 isolates (Figure S1). This finding may warn the emergence of new genotypes or variant if broad S mutations are incidentally accumulated in a specific virus in the natural host that is predominant in the field. Moreover, the 2017 G1b and G2b isolates were found to be phylogenetically different from former respective Korean strains, indicating that continuous and independent evolution in the natural host occurs under environmental pressures. In an interesting manner, a large 13\u2010aa DEL in the region of ORF1a encoding nsp3 was identified in G2b KNU\u20101705 virus, which is the first report of a novel nsp3\u2010DEL variant. Nsp3 critically serves as a PLpro that posttranslationally trims replicase polyproteins into functional nsps during virus replication. However, this unique DEL is in the Glu\u2010rich acidic region, which does not affect the authentic roles of nsp3 and thus is nonessential for coronavirus replication (Lei, Kusov, & Hilgenfeld, 2018). Although the virus can tolerate the large nsp3\u2010DEL which is dispensable for PEDV replication as shown in Figure 2, the pathogenicity of the KNU\u20101705 virus remains unclear. We have obtained a KNU\u20101705 isolate that can grow efficiently in cell culture and are currently investigating its biological properties. Based on the high degree of cross\u2010neutralization between the 2014 and 2017 PEDV strains, the antigenicity may be maintained for at least 4 years. This finding indicates the effectiveness of 2013\u20132014 pandemic strain (KNU\u2010141112)\u2010derived vaccines currently available in South Korea against existing PEDV epidemics. However, consistent with small\u2010scale genetic changes in the 2017 isolates within the identical G2b genotype, antigenic variations appeared to be ongoing under various field conditions. Therefore, the timeline of this situation is unclear and it is unknown whether antigenic differences among PEDV epidemic strains will contribute to the failure of current G2b vaccines. To counteract the prospective scenario, further studies are critical for securing culturable PEDV epidemic strains that are genetically, phenotypically and antigenically characterized in the laboratory.",

Despite their genetic diversity, antigenicity currently seems to remain unchanged among G2b strains, indirectly confirming the efficacy of G2b\u2010based vaccines against homologous G2b PEDVs responsible for current epidemics. Because the virus is assumed to undergo an evolutionary process to accumulate mutations to ensure viral fitness in the field, new genotypes or variants of PEDV, against which the current G2b vaccine may provide partial protection, will eventually emerge. Furthermore, this circumstance may advent earlier than expected if PEDV outbreaks fade from our attention following sporadic or endemic outbreaks without serious economic problems. Therefore, it is important to execute mandatory notification of PED\u2010like outbreaks essentially followed by activating an MOSS, including early diagnosis, to survey forthcoming PEDV strains that may emerge locally or globally through genetic drift (e.g., nonsilent point mutations) or genetic shift (e.g., recombination events) and obtain and characterize epidemic field isolates to predict and prepare for future epizootics or panzootics.",
