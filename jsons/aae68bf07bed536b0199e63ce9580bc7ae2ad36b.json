Therefore, we chose to proceed on the Claisen rearrangement with thermal conditions in the microwave-assisted synthesis of the compound 11 [14] . Interestingly, Eu(fod) 3 had a marked effect upon 8-allyl-7hydroxy-4-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2H-chromen-2-one (11) formation. Thus, heating in microwaves 7-allyloxyneoflavone 10 at 230 \u00b0C in DMF for 20 h recovered starting material only, while the addition of Eu(fod) 3 (9 mol%) gave rise to 60% yield of C-allylated product 11 (Table 1) , set for the further step in the olefin cross-metathesis reaction. 1 H NMR spectrum of 8-allyl-7-hydroxyneoflavone 11 shows the signal at 8.12 ppm assigned to OH, while the absence of H8, the doublet at 3.63 ppm, the multiplets at 5.00-5.12 ppm and 5.95-6.11 ppm indicate the CO-bond cleavage and the substitution of C-8 with allyl group.",

We envisaged that the olefin cross-metathesis reaction with 8-allylneoflavone 12 would proceed in relatively low yield of the target 3,3\u2032-dimethylallyl product 3 in view of the steric hindrance factor that requires a higher temperature for this reaction. Therefore, in contrast with the approach reported by Tischer and Metz (2-methyl-2-butene, the second-generation Grubbs catalyst (1 mol%), benzene, room temperature, overnight, 73% yield for a mixture) the suggested rapid heating in microwaves (100 \u00b0C, 300 W) of the 8-allylneoflavone 12, 2-methyl-2-butene, the second-generation Grubbs catalyst (5 mol%) in DCM under argon allowed us to overcome this problem successively to isolate the pivotal product 3 in 65% yield.
