In 1944, the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago Convention) was signed by 52 nations. In 1947, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) was established to set necessary standards and regulations, becoming a specialised agency of the United Nations (UN) in the same year (ICAO, 2013c, ICAO, 2013e). Growth of the civil aviation industry since 1940, in terms of fuel-consumed, is shown in Fig. 1\n.",

Growth in aviation fuel-use and the associated CO2 emissions are shown in Fig. 1.

The ITF also suggests that the high oil-price of 2008, and the following recession, have led to the retirement of older, less fuel-efficient aircraft from the global fleet (ITF, 2012). This is likely to have increased recent fuel-efficiency improvement rates, and produced the ATAG figures (2.1% p.a. since 2010) which show both ATAG and ICAO goals have been exceeded since 2010.

Now that the ICAO has agreed a global MBM will be introduced, the EC have proposed that from 2014 until the global MBM is implemented in 2020, flights with an origin or destination outside the EU-ETS will once-again be included under the scheme. However, the proposal is that only emissions from the proportion of the flight within the EU-ETS airspace are to be included (EC, 2013b). This is less stringent than the original scheme, where emissions from the entire flight were included. With this less stringent scheme the EU can argue that they are only addressing those emissions that arise within their geographic-area.

However, maybe the most important role it will play is as a flagship scheme, pushing international aviation emissions up the political agenda (Preston et al., 2012), and demonstrating that it is feasible to address these emissions with an agreed multi-national MBM (albeit international agreement between nations that have pre-existing close-ties through the EU).

Over the next 10\u201320 years, friction drag offers the most potential for further improvements (ICAO, 2010c), with computational fluid dynamics modelling suggesting it can be reduced by 20\u201370% (King et al., 2010). Beyond that time-frame, more radical re-designs of the conventional airliner airframe-layout are currently being researched, such as the blended-wing-body (BWB) design. Sometimes called a flying-wing design, the BWB approach increases aerodynamic efficiency through minimising any aircraft surfaces that do not contribute to lift-generation, and potentially offers large fuel-efficiency improvements. However, BWB must overcome issues such as passenger acceptance of windowless designs, the difficulties inherent in pressurising non-cylindrical shapes (King et al., 2010), and current airport-infrastructure needing to be reconfigured to load/unload BWB designs. Additionally, although there is no definitive demarcation between large and small aircraft or long and short range, the BWB is seen as being best-suited to larger aircraft over longer distances (Morris et al., 2009). Therefore, the BWB approach is less likely to offer potential for smaller aircraft on shorter flights.",

The current ATM-system is largely based on airspace organised around national borders leading to inefficient routings that impose mileage-penalties. Studies of the European route network suggest ATM-related impediments increase flight-distances by an average of 9\u201310%. Additionally, at certain times of day, a lack of airport capacity can be an issue causing congestion and delays; with each minute spent flying a holding-pattern awaiting a landing-slot producing an average 160 kg of CO2 emissions (King et al., 2010).",

However, depending on the final agreements on scope of applicability and stringency, the standard may force airlines into engine-upgrade or fleet-replacement timetables in advance of original plans, which could incur unwelcome additional costs. It remains to be seen how wide-ranging and stringent an agreement the ICAO can secure from the interested parties.",

For example, as well as precipitating technological and operational measures to reduce CO2 emissions, MBMs can act as a disincentive to choose air-travel through passing on to the consumer the increased costs due to the MBM, thereby reducing demand (Anger and K\u00f6hler, 2010). Modal-shift towards transport-modes with better carbon-efficiency is a further way of reducing aviation demand. For example, it is generally acknowledged that High-Speed Rail (HSR) emits less CO2 per passenger-kilometre in comparison to aviation (Campos and de Rus, 2009). A national government policy of investing in new HSR services, or promoting existing HSR services, could induce modal-shift away from aviation. In 1992, when HSR was introduced to Spain on the Madrid-Sevilla route, the rail share of the total rail-and-air market increased from 21% in 1991 to 82% in 1993 (Fu et al., 2012). The optimal whole-journey time for HSR is 3\u20134 h, with its time-advantage over aviation disappearing when the whole-journey time by train exceeds 4 h (Fu et al., 2012). Additionally, it is often argued that information and communication technology (ICT) can reduce the demand for work-related travel through replacing physical-mobility with virtual-mobility (Lassen et al., 2006, Lu and Peeta, 2009).",

Rather than change their own behaviour, passengers are more likely to see other bodies, such as governments or airlines, as having responsibility for finding solutions (Hooper et al., 2009). A further factor affecting individual behaviour is the world-wide rise of Low Cost Carriers (LCCs), which began with deregulation of the domestic market in the USA and liberalisation of the European market. The rapid growth of the LCC business model has driven down the cost of air-travel; and this reduction of any affordability-barrier has stimulated demand, and made individual consumers less likely to avoid air-travel (Lei and Papatheodorou, 2010, de Wit and Zuidberg, 2012).",

Therefore, the value of CO2 implied is $23.47/34 kg, or $690/tonne (in year 2012 dollars). This result shows consistency with a 2009 study into aviation in a low-carbon EU which found that carbon-prices well in excess of $400/tonne (\u20ac300/tonne) were required to constrain emissions within acceptable limits (Bows et al., 2009).",

So, the value placed on CO2 by the annual price-increase required to produce the necessary reduction in demand-growth ($690/tonne) ranges from approximately 7 to 100 times greater than these examples.",
