            "text": "\n\nThe world is, of course, nothing but our conception of it.\nAnton Chekhov(1860\u20131904)\n\nThe correct answer is D. There is strong evidence to recommend the use of LMWH over UFH for DVT prophylaxis in the setting of acute ischemic stroke, except in cases where LMWH is contraindicated (i.e. renal failure). Additionally, although the half-life of tPA is only several minutes, current guidelines recommend waiting at least 24 h after tPA administration beforeinitiating chemoprophylaxis. IPC should be used concurrently [1].\nThe correct answer is E. Varicella encephalitis can present with multifocal infarcts secondary to vasculitic processes, with associated signal abnormalities in the cortical-white matter junction or cerebellum. Varicella-induced vasculitis may also result in cerebral aneurysms, carotid dissections, and in certain cases, may even cause peripheral vascular disease [2].\nThe correct answer is B. There are many theories regarding the development in ARDS in the setting of SAH. One of the most prominent is \u201cblast theory\u201d, in which the initial catecholamine surge in SAH results in a shift of blood from the systemic to the low resistance pulmonary circulation, resulting in both endothelial injury and capillary hydrostatic edema. This is most accurately categorized as neurogenic and non-cardiogenic. Classic pulmonary edema is non-neurogenic and cardiogenic, while heart failure secondary to stress cardiomyopathy or infarction secondary to SAH would be both neurogenic and cardiogenic [3].\nThe correct answer is A. This patient\u2019s renal impairment precludes her from receiving apixaban, rivaroxaban, or fondaparinux. Low molecular weight heparin needs to be dose-adjusted in the setting of renal impairment, meaning that full dose therapy (60 mg twice a day) would not be appropriate.\nThe correct answer is E. The pathophysiology of uremic encephalopathy is complex and poorly understood. Many factors are believed to be involved, including the presence of circulating toxins, a disrupted blood-brain barrier, altered cerebral metabolism, and neurotransmitter dysfunction. Uremic encephalopathy occurs in most patients in the absence of overt cerebral hemorrhage.\nThe correct answer is E. As a rule of thumb, the average glucose can be roughly estimated by the formula (serum A1c \u00d7 29) \u2212 47, assuming the A1c is accurate (i.e. no condition that significantly increases or decreases red cell lifespan). In this case, the answer is (10 \u00d7 29) \u2212 47, or 236 mg/dL.\nThe correct answer is A. Anta-NMDA encephalitis is a paraneoplastic phenomenon associated with a number of malignancies, the most common (by far) being a teratoma of the ovaries. Malignancies of the lung, brain, colon and skin are much less likely to be the causative agent in this case, particularly in a young patient with no prior medical history.\nThe correct answer is B. The most common cause of sudden collapse and cardiac arrest in previously young, healthy individuals is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A subset of these patient may be prone to lethal arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, particularly during rigorous exercise. Several of the other answer choices listed may also cause sudden cardiac arrest in a previously healthy young individual, but are far less common. These include aneurysm rupture, commotio cordis (unlikely without an impact to the chest), and Brugada syndrome. Severe hyponatremia is also unlikely to manifest as collapse without any preceding symptoms.\nThe correct answer is E. Although most patients with preeclampsia will be medically managed with relatively few complications, a subset will go on to develop eclampsia (tonic-clonic seizure activity). Even after the definitive therapy for preeclampsia (delivery of the fetus and placenta), patients continue to be at risk of late postpartum eclampsia. Cases have been reported up until about 6 weeks postpartum.\nThe correct answer is B. Ceftriaxone and vancomycin provide the narrowest coverage for all suspected organisms based on this patient\u2019s age group (i.e. Nisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Cefazolin is not able to penetrate the cerebral spinal fluid for treatment of meningitis. Ampicillin is only recommended for patients <1 month old and >50 years old. Piperacillin/tazobactam and meropenem would technically be sufficient, but both provide much broader coverage than needed for the empiric treatment of community acquired meningitis [4].\nThe correct answer is D. The majority of intramedullary spinal cord lesions are gliomas, and of these, ependymomas (65%) and astrocytomas (35%) are most common. Hemangioblastomas also occur, though less commonly, and intramedullar metastatic lesions are rare. Meningiomas are not intramedullary [5].\nThe correct answer is B. The formula for stroke volume is correct as shown. Cardiac index = cardiac output/body surface area. Systemic vascular resistance = 80 \u00d7 (mean arterial pressure \u2212 right atrial pressure)/cardiac output. Pulmonary vascular resistance = 80 \u00d7 (mean arterial pressure \u2212 pulmonary artery occlusion pressure)/cardiac output.\nThe correct answer is C. Although impractical, ice water immersion is the most effective means of rapidly correcting this patient\u2019s heat stroke and hyperthermia, followed by intravenous chilled saline, evaporative cooling, and ice pack application. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are of no use in this scenario. Dantrolene, although primarily used for malignant hyperthermia related to anesthetic use, has also been described for use in life-threatening exertional heat illnesses [6].\nThe correct answer is B. HIE therapy has been used as rescue therapy in patients suffering from both calcium channel blocker (CCB) and beta blocker (BB) toxicity. Doses are typically several orders of magnitude larger than those used for diabetic ketoacidosis, ranging from 1 to 10 units/kg/h in conjunction with a continuous dextrose infusion. The mechanism action involves improved myocardial glucose uptake and increase inotropy, which counteracts the cardiovascular collapse seen in CCB and BB overdose [7].\nThe correct answer is A. Use of levothyroxine in brain-dead patients significantly decreases vasopressor requirements compared to standard care. As a result, levothyroxine use (along with aggressive blood product resuscitation) is associated with a significantly increased number of solid organs transplanted per donor [8].\nThe correct answer is E. The FOUR score is a mental status scoring system that may be used in placed of the more traditional Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Although the FOUR score is more complicated than the GCS, there is evidence of better inter-rater reliability. The elements of the FOUR score are as follows: eye opening (open and tracking, 4 points; open and not tracking, 3 points; closed but open to voice, 2 points; closed but open to pain, 1 point; will not open, 0 points), motor function (thumbs up/fist/peace sign, 4 points; localizing, 3 points; flexion posturing, 2 points; extensor posturing, 1 point; no response, 0 points), respiratory function (not intubated, 4 points; not intubated by Cheyne-Stokes, 3 points; not intubated but irregular, 2 points; intubated but overbreathing, 1 point; intubated and not overbreathing, 0 points), and brainstem function (pupil/corneal reflexes present, 4 points; one pupil fixed/dilated, 3 points; either pupil/corneal reflex absent, 2 points; both absent, 1 point; no cough reflex, 0 points).\nThe correct answer is E. One of the main goals of mechanical ventilation in status asthmaticus is to prevent worsening of dynamic hyperinflation and its consequences (such as barotrauma and hypotension). Minute ventilation is the most important determinant of dynamic hyperinflation in status asthmaticus; hence increasing tidal volume or respiratory rate would increase minute ventilation, and may worsen dynamic hyperinflation. In addition, increasing respiratory rate may shorten expiratory time and lead to worsening auto-PEEP. A certain degree of hypercarbia is tolerated unless patients have any compelling contraindications, such as raised intracranial pressure or hyperkalemia. In most cases, with continued bronchodilator therapy, airway resistance improves and dynamic hyperinflation is reversed. Addition of a bicarbonate drip at pH of 7.24 is unwarranted, and may lead to post-hypercapnic metabolic alkalosis. Switching to a pressure limited mode of ventilation may correct high peak airway pressure; however high airway pressures with normal plateau pressures in status asthamticus is due to airway narrowing, and does not lead to alveolar over distension and barotrauma. In addition, use of pressure control ventilation in status asthmaticus may lead to dangerously low tidal volume delivery that may reduce alveolar ventilation.\nThe correct answer is E. There are numerous mechanisms for refractory seizure activity when status epilepticus is prolonged. These include an upgregulation of transport molecules which clear medications like phenytoin and phenobarbital, an upregulation of excitotoxic NMDA receptors, a downregulation of suppressive GABA receptors, and an influx of numerous proinflammatory molecules which may alter blood-brain barrier permeability.\nThe correct answer is D. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine can worsen his seizure disorder by exacerbating his chronic hyponatremia. Phenytoin and fosphenytoin can induce cardiovascular instability. Valproate, which can be helpful as a mood stabilizer, will worsen his platelet dysfunction and can tip him over into severe hepatic failure. Topiramate is contraindicated in patients with both cognitive impairment and nephrolithiasis.\nThe correct answer is C. The absence of fevers, purulence, wheezing, and a normal I:E ratio make a COPD exacerbation very unlikely. Salivation and increased bronchial secretions are a well-described muscarinic receptor mediated side effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and can be managed with glycopyrrolate, which affects primarily the muscarinic receptors while still preserving the desired nicotinic effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.\nThe correct answer is C. Consciousness consists of arousal, the state of being awake and able to respond to stimuli, and awareness, which imbues stimuli with context and meaning through cortical processes. Coma is the absence of both. Minimally conscious states involve normal arousal, but impaired awareness (though it may be present to some small extent.) Persistent vegetative states, on the other hand, involve normal arousal with absent awareness. The locked-in syndrome is characterized by intact arousal and awareness, but an inability to move other than blinking and vertical eye movements.\nThe correct answer is C. This patient has Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is a transient stress-related cardiac syndrome characterized by left ventricular apical akinesis and impaired systolic function. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is effective in treating pulmonary edema in this setting, and has been shown to decrease intubation rates. The echo findings are characteristic of this type of cardiomyopathy and do not fit the distribution of a particular vessel, making cardiac catheterization unnecessary.\nThe correct answer is A. Atherosclerotic disease accounts for a plurality of spinal cord ischemia. Aortic pathology and degenerative disease also account for a significant number of cases. Spinal cord ischemia and infarction secondary to systemic hypotension or a cardioembolic source is relatively less common [9].\nThe correct answer is E. The PATCH study was a prospective randomized trial evaluating platelet transfusion versus standard care in patients with spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage who were also on antiplatelet therapy. The study found that patients in the transfusion group had poorer outcomes at 3 months (both mortality and modified Rankin) compared to standard therapy, along with a higher rate of adverse events during their hospital stay [10].\nThe correct answer is E. Numerous interventions have been trialed to prevent DCI in the setting of SAH, but the majority of them have failed to provide meaningful benefit. These include statins, corticosteroids, magnesium, and nicardipine (in contrast to the calcium channel blocker nimodipine, which is used extensively for this purpose).\nThe correct answer is E. The patient has severe community acquired pneumonia and several risk factors for ICU admission. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may be used to successfully treat patients with respiratory failure from a COPD exacerbation provided they are hemodynamically stable, alert, and able to protect their airway. While there are several possible reasons for his clinical deterioration including hypercapnea and primary cardiac pathology, he is now hemodynamically unstable and minimally responsive, and requires urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation.\nThe correct answer is E. Concomitant enteral tube feeds have long been recognized as a source of subtherapeutic phenytoin levels, though the mechanism remains somewhat unclear. There is no evidence that any one tube feed formulation may reduce this risk. However, the effect may be mitigated by holding tube feeds before and after each dose of phenytoin [11]. Although transiti oning to 18 h feeds and only administering phenytoin at night would also achieve this purpose, it would likely still result in subtherapeutic phenytoin levels as a result of decreased administration.\nThe correct answer is A. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare demyelinating disease usually seen in patients with immunosuppression, including those with AIDS or individuals taking immunosuppressive medications. It is caused by the JC virus. The diagnosis is suggested by characteristic multifocal frontal and parietal subcortical white matter findings on CT or MRI, in addition to the identification of the JC virus in the CSF. Brain biopsy may also be diagnostic. The condition is fatal in up to 50% of individuals, and survivors may be left severely disabled.\nThe correct answer is D. This patient has severe community acquired pneumonia in the setting of immunosuppression as a result of her recent RA flare and ongoing prednisone use. For patients with severe community acquired pneumonia requiring ICU admission, Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines recommend use of a antipneumococcal \u00df-lactam (i.e. ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin-sulbactam) plus azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, or levofloxacin) [12]. In addition, this patient has been on a significant dose of glucocorticoid (greater than 20 mg of prednisone for 1 month or longer) in addition to receiving methotrexate weekly for RA, which also puts her at risk for Pneumocystis (PCP) infection. As she has not been on prophylaxis for PCP, she should also be empirically treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\n\nThe correct answer is D. This patient is euvolemic and eunatremic with a normal serum osmolarity. Therefore, simple postoperative fluid mobilization is the most likely culprit.\nThe correct answer is E. Post-dural puncture headache is a relatively common complaint. Although blood patch administration is often sought for relief, conservative measures should be trialed first. These include supine positioning, fluid administration, use of oral analgesics, and, if necessary, use of methylxanthine derivatives such as caffeine and aminophylline. Steroids have not been shown to be beneficial in this setting [13].\nThe correct answer is B. Plaque rupture is the most common cause of acute myocardial infarction overall, where thrombogenic material is exposed to the coronary circulation. The other causes mentioned may also result in acute myocardial infarction, but are far less likely [14].\nThe correct answer is A. This presentation is consistent with Ogilvie\u2019s syndrome, also known as colonic pseudoobstruction. If untreated, severe dilatation can lead to perforation. In this case, pro-motility agents (erythromycin) and cessation of all opiates have already proven ineffective. Surgical treatments have a high rate of complication for this entity, and should only be attempted after all medical therapies have been exhausted. Percutaneous cecostomy has been described, but it is also somewhat invasive, and without a proven record of success. Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor, increasing post synaptic concentrations of acetylcholine and boosting colonic motor function. Small controlled trials have shown success using neostigmine for colonic pseudoobstruction, but it must be administered carefully. Side effects can include severe bradycardia with cardiovascular collapse, as well as severe bronchospasm. Neostigmine is also contraindicated if there is evidence of mechanical obstruction [15].\nThe correct answer is C. Developmental venous anomalies are by far the most common malformation of the choices listed. The majority of these anomalies are asymptomatic, and generally require no treatment.\nThe correct answer is A. A CSF reservoir (also known as an Ommaya) may be placed for a number of reasons, most commonly for chemotherapeutic or palliative purposes in oncology patients. They allow for easy access to the CSF for both sampling and intrathecal medication administration. Ommaya related infections involve coagulase-negative staphylococci in about half of cases. The next most common organism is Propionobacterium acnes, which is seen in approximately one quarter of cases [16].\nThe correct answer is E. The patient here is experiencing cerebral salt wasting (CSW). Although it can be difficult to differentiate CSW from the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH), there are a few important distinctions. Patients with CSW tend to be hypovolemic, whereas patients with SIADH may either be euvolemic or hypervolemic. Both conditions may demonstrate decreased serum sodium, decreased serum osmolarity, and increased urinary sodium. In this case, decreased IVC diameter and an increasing serum hematocrit make CSW more likely. In addition to volume replacement, reasonable options include hypertonic saline, mineralocorticoids, and enteral sodium supplements. Unlike SIADH, fluid restriction in this setting would be harmful.\nThe correct answer is C. Although the majority of fevers in the ICU are infectious in origin, a significant minority may be non-infectious, particularly among patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The onset tends to be earlier versus infectious fever, usually within the first 72 h. Central fever may be difficult to confirm in many cases, as it is usually a diagnosis of exclusion [17].\nThe correct answer is A. Of the choices listed, flaccid paralysis is most commonly associated with encephalitis secondary to West Nile virus. Fever, altered mental status, and gastrointestinal complaints are also common in these patients. Among those who survive their illness, motor weakness may be permanent [18].\nThe correct answer is A. HIT is the result of the formation of antibodies to circulating platelets. The development of HIT, somewhat paradoxically, is linked to increase risk of thrombotic adverse events. Therefore, the discontinuation of heparin products alone is insufficient. Danaparoid, fondaparinux, or argatroban are all acceptable treatment options.\nThe correct answer is C. In a sub-study of the landmark targeted temperature management by Nielsen and colleagues, it was demonstrated that in 171 consecutively enrolled patients, there was no evidence to support the assumption that a target temperature of 33\u00b0 was associated with either impaired hemostasis or an increase in bleeding events. There is no evidence to support the superiority of one method of cooling over the other [19].\nThe correct answer is B. The waveforms below indicate double triggering, a form of ventilator asynchrony in which patient-initiated breaths can be seen immediately following ventilator-initiated breaths. Double triggering may be due to patient demand exceeding ventilator inspiratory time, or inadequate set tidal volumes. Reverse triggering refers to diaphragmatic contraction stimulated by ventilator insufflation in a ventilator-initiated breath. Breath stacking refers to dynamic hyperinflation due to incomplete exhalation, and is often seen in patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Missed triggering refers to patient respiratory efforts that are not sensed by the ventilator.\nThe correct answer is A. Paroxysmal pulmonary edema is a long-recognized complication of naloxone-mediated \u03bc-opioid antagonism. Massive catecholamine surges are thought to result in increased pulmonary hydrostatic pressures and abnormal capillary permeability [20]. Direct cardiac dysfunction may also be a contributing factor in certain cases, but is less likely in this otherwise healthy 19-year-old with no hemodynamic compromise.\nThe correct answer is D. Ataxic respiration is characterized by a random, shifting pattern of both deep and shallow breathing with irregular intervals between breaths. It usually precedes agonal respirations and apnea, and indicates medullary dysfunction. Cheyne-Stokes respirations, on the other hand, have a progressive, oscillating pattern of hyperventilation and relative apnea. Central hyperventilation is characterized by rapid, regular deep breaths, with resultant hypocarbia and respiratory alkalosis. Lesions are localized to the midbrain and pons. Apneustic respiration is characterized by pauses of up to several seconds at the end of both inspiration and expiration, and usually indicates pontine injury.\nThe correct answer is B. Benedikt syndrome is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor nerve palsy, and tremor, with lesions located in the median tegmentum. Both Weber\u2019s syndrome and Claude\u2019s syndrome describe oculomotor nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis secondary to midbrain infarcts, with the latter also involving contralateral hemiplegia of the face and tongue. Wallenberg\u2019s syndrome, resulting from a lateral medullary injury, describes ataxia and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the ipsilateral face and contralateral limbs. Dejerine syndrome usually consists of ipsilateral tongue weakness and contralateral limb weakness following a medial medullary injury.\nThe correct answer is D. While esophagitis can occasionally lead to GI bleeding, it is most commonly associated chest pain and/or dysphagia. The other options listed are far more common causes of bleeding.\nThe correct answer is B. Malnutrition is one of the most common causes of an elevated INR in ICU patients. This is particularly true for those who are not on warfarin therapy and have no symptoms of systemic illness which may result in the development of DIC. Synthetic hepatic dysfunction is also possible, but less likely, particularly given a normal INR on admission. Heparin use may cause an elevated INR at very high doses, but should not be a factor at prophylactic doses. In cases such as these, vitamin K administration will usually correct the coagulopathy.\nThe correct answer is D. Sarcoidosis is a disease of systemic granuloma formation, with a small subset of patients experiencing prominent CNS involvement (termed neurosarcoidosis). In this setting, facial nerve involvement is the most common presenting symptom. All of the other answer choices (seizures, limb weakness, hydrocephalus, and cauda equina syndrome causing urinary incontinence) may be present as well. Biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis, although the diagnosis may be suggested by a combination of imaging studies and laboratory testing (including hypercalcemia and elevated CSF angiotensin-converting enzyme.)\nThe correct answer is A. The clotting cascade includes both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The intrinsic pathway involves the activation of the following factors (in this order): factor XII, factor XI, factor IX (along with factor VIII). The extrinsic pathway involves the conversion of factor VII to VIIa, which then aids in the conversion of factor X to Xa (along with tissue factor).\nThe correct answer is A. This patient likely has primary angiitis of the central nervous system. ESR and CRP are typically normal. Beading of the medium and small vessels may be seen on angiography. CSF analysis usually reveals a lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and normal glucose. The classic histopathologic finding is granulomatous segmental vasculitis with Langerhans or foreign body giant cells on brain biopsy.\nThe correct answer is C. A heparin infusion is often the first line of therapy for treatment of an acute PE. The PTT must be monitored closely, with a therapeutic goal usually in the 60\u201380 s range. Lower ranges may result in inadequate anticoagulation, while higher ranges may expose the patient to an unacceptably high bleeding risk.\nThe correct answer is A. This patient has newly discovered diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, and requires DVT prophylaxis that will not increase her risk of bleeding complications. Intermittent pneumatic compression alone is appropriate until the source of her bleeding is controlled. If a source is not identified after a thorough work-up (i.e. conventional angiography and MR imaging of the neuroaxis), chemoprophylaxis can be initiated after her hemorrhage is stable on repeat imaging [1].\nThe correct answer is A. Any of the answer choices are possible etiologies for acute lower GI bleeding. However, the most common cause overall is diverticular disease, followed by hemorrhoids and inflammatory bowel disease, and less often, malignancy [21].\nThe correct answer is E. Apnea testing should be performed with the patient disconnected from the ventilator and while administering supplemental oxygen down the endotracheal tube to prevent hypoxia. A eucapneic (35\u201345 mmHg) baseline blood gas should be obtained, although higher levels of PaCO2 may be acceptable in patients with chronic hypercapnia. The patient should be closely observed for any signs of respiration, including both chest and abdominal excursions. The test is considered positive (i.e., the patient is truly apneic) if no respirations are detected and a repeat blood gas demonstrates a PaCO2 \u226560 mmHg or \u226520 over baseline). Repeat testing may be necessary, and may be extended beyond 10 min if the patient remains hemodynamically stable.\nThe correct answer is B. Of all the findings listed, the presence of hydronephrosis on ultrasound may not necessarily be pathologic. A denervated ureter is transplanted along with the donor kidney, resulting in diminished ureter tone. This, coupled with the increased urine production of the solitary kidney, may result in hydronephrosis that may be a stable finding over time. Comparison to prior imaging is crucial.\nThe correct answer is C. Hemorrhage into the cerebellum , due to the narrow confines of the posterior fossa, creates a high risk of brainstem compression resulting in respiratory insufficiency and, if progressive, herniation. Intraventricular extension is also a well-described complication. The hydrocephalus caused by cerebellar herniation is usually noncommunicating due to obstruction of the fourth ventricle, either by direct compression or via clot formation as a result of intraventricular extension.\nThe correct answer is E. The patient has neutrophilic pleocytosis in the pleural fluid, along with low pleural fluid pH and LDH greater than 2/3rd of upper limit of normal, consistent with exudative pleural effusion due to pleural infection. Positive Gram stain, pleural fluid pH <7.2, pleural LDH >1000 U/L, pleural glucose <40 mg/dL, or frank pus on gross examination are indications for insertion of a chest tube for control of pleural infection in addition to systemic antibiotics. Patients having rapidly re-accumulating pleural effusion due to advanced liver dysfunction despite optimal diuretic management can be offered TIPS to reduce portal venous pressure. Insertion of a tunneled pleural catheter is usually performed for symptom relief in rapidly re-accumulating pleural effusions in conditions such as malignancy as an alternative or additive procedure to pleurodesis. Use of tunneled pleural catheters in the management of hepatic hydrothorax is controversial due to high incidence of complications; infection being the most prominent.\nThe correct answer is B. Overly aggressive volume repletion and induced hypertension can be deleterious. Instead, gentle escalation in hemodynamic augmentation and urgent confirmation of ischemia can identify whether or not the patient requires intra-arterial therapy. Albumin and magnesium once held promise as treatment options for delayed cerebral ischemia, but this has not borne out in randomized clinical trials. Intraventricular calcium channel blockade is usually reserved for distal vasospasm, and may be considered after perfusion imaging and conventional angiography.\nThe correct answer is B. The cervical x-ray demonstrates unilateral facet dislocation involving C4 on C5, which is characterized by subluxation of the upper vertebrae by a distance of <50% of the anterior-posterior diameter of the vertebral body. The mechanism is usually hyperflexion accompanied by rotation, resulting in disruption the posterior ligament complex. This represents a stable cervical injury, because the subluxed vertebra is \u201clocked\u201d in place by the remaining intact ligaments. It is not commonly associated with spinal cord injury [22].\nThe correct answer is C. Of the choices listed, the only medication lacking a specific reversal agent is apixaban. Dabigatran had previously lacked a reversal agent before the introduction of idarucizumab, a monoclonal antibody which rapidly binds the drug.\nThe correct answer is E. In the setting of hemorrhagic shock, blood product transfusion is not titrated to any one specific hemoglobin concentration. Rather, blood products are titrated to hemodynamic parameters and stability.\nThe correct answer is B. Repetitive episodes of GABA stimulation with exogenous sedatives (alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, etc.) leads to both down-regulation of GABA receptors and glutamate hyperactivity, resulting in more severe subsequent episodes of withdrawal and contributing to treatment recalcitrance. This is referred to as the \u201ckindling phenomenon\u201d.\nThe correct answer is A. Although case reports exist for the majority of antibiotics used in clinical practice regarding exacerbating underlying myasthenia gravis, there are a number of agents which are notorious for doing so. These include the fluoroquinolones (the most common culprits), aminoglycosides, and macrolides [23]. Vancomycin is less likely to be problematic in myasthenic patients.\nThe correct answer is A. This patient has a tension pneumothorax, evidenced by a \u201cblackout\u201d of the entire left lung and shift of the mediastinal structures to the right, along with hypotension now requiring pressors. This patient requires immediate tube thoracostomy or needle decompression on the left side of the chest.\nThe correct answer is D. The WFNS grading scale for subarachnoid hemorrhage is as follows: Grade 1, GCS 15, no motor deficit; Grade 2, GCS 13\u201314, no motor deficit; Grade 3, GCS 13\u201314, with motor deficit; Grade 4, GCS 7\u201312, with or without motor deficit; Grade 5, GCS 3\u20136, with or without motor deficit.\nThe correct answer is B. Major burns induce fluid loss to the external environment, capillary leak, and vasodilation, resulting in both absolute and relative hypovolemia. As such, the cornerstone of early burn management is volume resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid (typically lactated ringer\u2019s solution). Fluid resuscitation requirements (over the first 24 h of resuscitation) can be estimated by first determining the actual body weight and the total body surface area (TBSA) burned. The TBSA burned can be estimated in adults using the \u201crule of 9s\u201d\u2014in this case, the patient has sustained approximately 54% TBSA burns (each arm is 9%, the front and back of the torso are each 18%). The volume of fluid required is indexed to weight and TBSA burned using the Parkland formula, where the patient is given 4 mL per kg per %TBSA burned. Half of the calculated volume is given in the first 8 h of resuscitation, and half in the subsequent 16 h. It is to be emphasized that these indexed formulas only provide an estimation of volume resuscitation requirements, and fluid resuscitation, as it progresses, should be titrated to clinical response and diagnostic markers [24].\nThe correct answer is E. This patient is presenting with hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and hyponatremia, most likely from sympathomimetic drug exposure and psychomotor agitation due to 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) abuse. MDMA-induced SIADH may cause severe hyponatremia, and in this case, requires treatment with hypertonic saline. Fluid restriction would be inappropriate in this setting, and normal saline may worsen his hyponatremia.\nThe correct answer is A. This patient is in convulsive status epilepticus, and 0.1 mg/kg of lorazepam should be considered first line therapy (this patient has only received 0.05 mg/kg thus far). Rushing to intubate the patient without controlling his seizures may be premature, as seizure abatement may result in a rapid improvement in his mental status (although if intubation is required, a propofol infusion would be an excellent choice). Paralysis with rocuronium will mask this patient\u2019s seizures post-intubation, and is a poor choice in this setting. Leaving a convulsing patient to reassess later is never acceptable, nor is moving an actively convulsing patient to CT scan without controlling their seizure activity first.\nThe correct answer is B. Patients on oral vitamin K antagonists with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage are at significant risk of deterioration, re-bleeding, and death. Resuscitative targeting of an INR <1.5 is appropriate to reduce this risk.\nThe correct answer is E. While resuscitation and antibiotics would be important, immediate surgical consultation is necessary. Identification and repair of the perforation is required to prevent further complications, such as abscess, obstruction, or fistula formation.\nThe correct answer is B. The patient in this vignette is severely ill, with a high APACHE II score and hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pneumonia. He also has underlying cardiac failure with reduced left ventricular function. Although he has clinically improved, he has several risk factors for weaning failure, such as age >65, severe illness, and cardiac failure. Early use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) as opposed to supplemental oxygen alone has shown to avert respiratory failure after extubation and decrease ICU mortality in patients at increased risk [25]. However, NIV does not seem to be beneficial in avoiding re-intubation when it is instituted in extubated patients once they have already developed signs of respiratory failure. In this situation, NIV has been shown to delay re-intubation and hence is associated with poorer outcomes. There is no evidence to support higher mean arterial blood pressure of 85 mmHg, oxygen saturation above 85%, inhaled mucolytics, or frequent chest physiotherapy in patients after discontinuation of mechanical ventilation to avoid re-intubation.\nThe correct answer is E. Steroids are not currently recommended for the treatment of traumatic spinal cord injuries. Therefore, none of the therapeutic regimens listed would be appropriate [26].\nThe correct answer is D. This patient\u2019s blood gas demonstrates \u201carterialization\u201d of the venous sample in the setting of an intentional drug ingestion and subsequent cardiac arrest, classic for cyanide toxicity. Cyanide acts as a cellular asphyxiant by poisoning the cytochromes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, and results in the body\u2019s inability to utilize oxygen, overwhelming circulatory collapse, and severe lactic acidosis. The oxygen-rich venous blood that is drawn from a cyanide-poisoned patient is often described as having a cherry-red color. Treatment of suspected cyanide poisoning involves the administration of the antidote, hydroxycobalamin.\nThe correct answer is B. The free water deficit (in L) for an adult female is as follows: (0.5 \u00d7 weight in kg) \u00d7 [(serum sodium/140) \u2212 1]. For adult males, the initial multiplier is 0.6. In this case: (0.5 \u00d7 60) \u00d7 [(160/140) \u2212 1] = ~4.2 L.\nThe correct answer is C. Cefepime and vancomycin represent broad spectrum coverage that includes noscomial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA. Ceftriaxone, vancomycin and ampicillin is the regimen of choice for community acquired meningitis in patients >50 years old. The other choices are incorrect because the beta-lactam in these answers lacks coverage for Pseudomonas.\nThe correct answer is D. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) have been used in order to provide some objective measure of neuronal functioning, and by extension, prognosis for recovery in patients with anoxic brain injury. The value of SSEPs in the setting of therapeutic hypothermia is less certain. Activity in response to median nerve stimulation is measured from the brachial plexus, dorsal horns, and thalamocortical radiations with N9, N13 and N20 waveforms, respectively.\nThe correct answer is B. Muromonab is an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, and the most commonly encountered adverse reactions are aseptic meningitis and a flu-like illness. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus are calcineurin inhibitors; both are associated with fine motor tremor, seizures, and a number of other neurologic adverse events. Mycophenolate commonly causes headaches.\nThe correct answer is B. The mortality from ARDS appears to be decreasing, from 35% in 1996 to 26% in 2005 [27]. Likely causes included better supportive care and improved ventilatory strategies. Patients with trauma-related ARDS have a lower mortality at 90 days [28]. In most survivors of ARDS, lung volumes and spirometry will normalize by 6 months, and supplemental oxygen is rarely required. However, survivors of ARDS may continue to experience exercise limitation and cognitive impairment up to 5 years after their illness [29].\nThe correct answer is A. The Monro-Kelly doctrine states that intracranial volume is fixed, and is comprised of three components blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain tissue. Any increase in one of those components is accompanied by a decrease in one or both of the other two.\nThe correct answer is A. Central diabetes insipidus may be encountered in patients after they have undergone pituitary surgery. Patients usually present with an elevated sodium level, elevated urine output, and low urine specific gravity. Patients also typically have nocturia and polydipsia. Disruption of antidiuretic hormone secretion after pituitary surgery is often partial and temporary, and normal osmoregulation typically returns after 3\u20135 days. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs most commonly secondary to acute kidney injury from contrast nephropathy, or may be related to use of certain medications such as lithium, aminoglycosides, or amphotericin B.\nThe correct answer is B. The EKG findings indicating the presence of a right bundle branch block include a QRS duration >120 ms, an RSR\u2019 pattern in leads V1 and V2, and the presence of a slurred S wave in V6 and I. A dominant S wave in V1 and a broad, monophasic R wave in V5 and V6 indicate a left bundle branch block. A short PR interval and delta wave are seen in Wolf-Parkinson-White pre-excitation syndrome.\nThe correct answer is B. The majority of cases of diverticulitis are uncomplicated. Complicated diverticulitis refers to cases of abscess formation, fistulization, stricture, and perforation. Gross hematochezia can be seen in simple diverticulosis and is one of the most common causes of lower GI bleeding [21].\nThe correct answer is D. According to the most recent CDC guidelines, patients with clean, minor wounds should receive a tetanus booster if it has been greater than 10 years since the last tetanus toxoid vaccine dose. Patients with deeper or contaminated wounds should receive a tetanus booster if it has been greater than 5 years since the last tetanus toxoid vaccine.\nThe correct answer is C. The GQ1b antibody is present in up to 90% of patients with the Miller-Fischer variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Other antibodies may be present in GBS as well, frequently with low sensitivity, which limits their clinical utility. Given the possible side effects of treatment, GBS should be confirmed by LP and neuroelectrophysiologic studies when possible. Typical LP findings include elevated protein with normal cell counts, although cell counts may be slightly elevated in a subset of patients. One third to one half of patients presenting early may not have the typical CSF protein elevation [30].\nThe correct answer is D. In patients receiving radiocontrast agents, saline infusion is helpful in attenuating kidney injury. Low-dose dopamine is no more effective than placebo in prevention of renal dysfunction in ICU patients. Other agents such as theophylline and n-acetylcysteine (NAC) have also failed to show consistent benefits [31].\nThe correct answer is E. Often times, in instances of hemodynamic instability and dynamic hyperinflation, the first maneuver is simply to disconnect the patient from the ventilator and allow them to exhale fully. This may result in rapid correction of the hypotension, after which the other therapies listed may be considered.\nThe correct answer is D. The CT scan demonstrates mildly displaced bilateral parasymphyseal mandibular fractures extending between the bilateral canines and first premolar teeth. Operative intervention is indicated. The mandible is not dislocated, and therefore attempted manual reduction is not appropriate. The sinuses are not involved in this patient\u2019s injury. Replacement of the missing tooth for cosmetic reasons may be considered after the primary injury is repaired.\nThe correct answer is A. Respiratory quotient is defined as the ratio of carbon dioxide elimination to oxygen consumption. It is calculated independently of age, gender, or body mass index. For example, carbohydrate metabolism can be described by: C6H12O6 + 6O2 \u2192 6CO2 + 6H2O; the respiratory quotient is therefore 1 (6CO2/6O2). Alternatively, because lipids contain fewer oxygen atoms relative to carbon and hydrogen atoms, lipid metabolism will result in a respiratory quotient closer to 0.7.\nThe correct answer is A. Patients with liver cirrhosis have a suppressed immune response, and higher rates of gut bacterial translocation. Prophylactic antibiotics have been proven to prevent infectious complications, reduce rates of re-bleeding, and improve overall mortality. Octreotide has favorable effects on splanchnic vasoconstriction and is often used in this setting, but without any proven mortality benefit. Propranolol may improve portal venous pressures, but use is limited due to side effects and a high number of non-responders. The use of lactulose is an important adjunct in cirrhotic patients, but does not reduce mortality in the setting of an active bleed [32].\nThe correct answer is C. This multi-system trauma patient with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 6 requires intubation, and rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is the preferred technique of airway management in major trauma [33]. RSI produces quick induction and neuromuscular blockade to facilitate rapid placement of a definitive orotracheal airway. This reduces the likelihood of aspiration, which is particularly important in trauma patients who most likely have not fasted prior to intubation.\nThe correct answer is E. Traditional weaning parameters, such as the RSBI, may not be accurate in predicting extubation failure in neurocritical care patients, likely due to the fact that extubation failure in neurocritical care patients is less likely the result of intrinsic lung pathology. Elements of the FOUR score, such as the motor and brainstem components, have also failed to prove particularly useful in this regard [34].\nThe correct answer is E. Toxic megacolon is a potentially life-threatening complication of C. difficile colitis. Symptoms of toxic megacolon include colonic distension, fever, tachycardia, altered mental status, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypotension. Front line treatment is usually conservative, consisting of bowel decompression, broadening antibiotic coverage, withholding medications that could worsen colonic distension, and repositioning and/or proning the patient. For patients that do not respond to conservative therapy, subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy may then be considered [35].\nThe correct answer is C. Toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of neurologic deterioration among patients with HIV and AIDS. Patients are at highest risk of reactivation of latent toxoplasmosis when CD4 counts drop below 200 cells/\u03bcL. A CD4 count greater than 500 cells/\u03bcL would be considered normal.\nThe correct answer is D. When evaluating whether a hospital will be certified as a Primary Stroke Center, the Joint Commission evaluates ongoing metrics based on best-practice goals. There is no current recommendation that all acute stroke patients receive a neurosurgical evaluation [36].\nThe correct answer is E. All of the choices listed represent the postulated mechanisms for the development of increased ICP during RRT. The answer choices describe the reverse urea hypothesis, idiogenic osmole hypothesis, rapid infusion of bicarbonate hypothesis, and intradialytic hypotension hypothesis, respectively. Another mechanism postulated is that the dialysate temperature may increase body temperature and worsen intracranial hypotension. The exact mechanisms for this phenomenon has not yet been elucidated.\nThe correct answer is A. Persistent vegetative states are marked by arousal without discernible awareness. These patients generally have preserved sleep/wake cycles [37].\nThe correct answer is E. Seizure activity may result from a toxic ingestion of a variety of substances. This paradoxically include medications that are central nervous system depressants and more traditionally associated with sedative properties at standard doses, including clonidine, meperidine, and baclofen.\nThe correct answer is D. The patient has multiple reasons for his abnormal sleeping pattern . His gender, obesity, and neck circumference (>17 in.) places him at a higher risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In fact, roughly two-thirds of people with a BMI >30 kg/m2 have OSA. He also has an acute ischemic infarct which can lead to central sleep apneas, such as Cheyne-Stokes, cluster breathing, or central neurogenic hyperventilation, to name a few. Polysomnography is the gold standard diagnostic test for sleep related breathing disorders. Apnea, by convention, is reduction of airflow to less than 90% for more than 10 s. For central apneas, there is no respiratory effort. With obstructive apneas, a central drive is still present, with some resultant respiratory effort [38]. Overnight oximetry may show episodic desaturations in oxygen, depending on the sleep disorder, but it would not differentiate central from obstructive apneas. Arterial blood gasses also may show hypocapnia if there is hyperventilation or hypoxemia, but it would not be as useful as a sleep study.\nThe correct answer is A. TTP is a form of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia caused by a lack of circulating ADAMTS13, which results in large, uncleaved masses of Von Willebrand factor triggering systemic platelet plugs and coagulation. These tangled nets of intravascular thrombi sever circulating red cells, resulting in the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral smear. The absence of schistocytes effectively rules out the diagnosis of TTP.\nThe correct answer is D. Aggressive pulmonary toilet is the most effective measure that will improve the patient\u2019s respiratory status. She is alert, awake, and hemodynamically stable, with rapid improvement in her oxygen saturation. Her head should be elevated up to 45\u00b0, and bronchodilators can be used for bronchospasm. Noninvasive ventilation should be avoided as this is a relative contraindication in an aspiration event, especially with an improving patient. The course of an aspiration pneumonitis can be divided into two stages. The first is categorized by coughing and bronchospasm that occur immediately after the aspiration event. The second is categorized by an inflammatory reaction that can occur within 6 h. If the patient continues to worsen and her respiratory status declines leading to mechanical ventilation, antibiotics should be considered at that time given the risk of persistent oropharyngeal aspiration [39]. There is no indication for steroids. The patient\u2019s chest x-ray does not show any evidence of lobar collapse or an aspirated foreign body, and the aspiration involved liquids, meaning bronchoscopy would be of little value.\nThe correct answer is A. Women may be more susceptible to pituitary necrosis due to the enlargement of the pituitary that occurs during pregnancy, making the gland more susceptible to ischemic injury in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock. Agalactorrhea is the most common initial complaint, although many patients may go several years without complaint until they experience symptoms of frank hypopituitarism. Dramatic presentations including severe headache, coma, and seizures are rare [40].\n",
