Infected patients mostly exhibit general signs of pneumonia (fever, dyspnea, coughing and desaturation) and a presumably significant number of infected patients are asymptomatic. Yet, about 5-10% of patients develop critical oxygen deprivation, needing intensive care and intubation with mechanical ventilation (Huang et al. 2020; Raoult et al. 2020) . Typical acute phase laboratory findings are present in admitted COVID-19 patients, e.g. elevated c-reactive protein and ferritin. Also, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are often elevated in COVID-19 patients, indicating liver damage (Zhou et al. 2020) . Recent reports point to the fact that liver injury, by means of increased aminotransferase levels, more frequently occurred in severe COVID-19 cases compared to patients with mild symptoms Guan et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020a, b; Chen et al. 2020) .",

Recently it was postulated that liver impairment in COVID-19 patients could also be drug-related ). This may have consequences for patients who are treated with novel, potentially hepatotoxic, antiviral drugs and perhaps also antibiotics for bacterial superinfections (Xu et al. 2020a, b) . Hydroxychloroquine is applied as an antiviral drug, with sparse evidence in small clinical settings. Yet, viral replication and disease progression would be reduced and overall survival would increase. The effect of hydroxychloroquine on hepatic tissue seems ambiguous, since it is used to treat liver infection with protozoa (i.e. malaria) but cases of fulminant hepatic failure have been reported (Makin et al. 1994; Liu et al. 2020a ). Azithromycin would have additional effects to hydroxychloroquine. However, there is little evidence and the underlying mechanisms are unclear (Gautret et al. 2020) . Furthermore, azithromycin-induced hepatotoxicity only appears 1-3 weeks after azithromycin initiation (Martinez et al. 2015) .",

            "text": "Patients suffering either from diabetes type 1 or 2, or developing hypertension, often receive blood pressure reducing ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type I receptor blockers, which may lead to ACE2 overexpression. Therefore, although clinical evidence is lacking, it has to be kept in mind that ACE2 upregulation might be at the origin of a higher susceptibility for developing COVID-19 (Fang et al. 2020; Fitzgerald 2020) . Furthermore, these patients often suffer from the metabolic syndrome, which is a major risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD can sensitize the liver for hepatotoxicants such as acetaminophen (Michaut et al. 2014; Massart et al. 2017) , which is the advised and widely used anti-pyretic symptomatic drug treatment. Although it is actually not known whether a link exists between COVID-19 and liver steatosis, it is worrying that in a recent post-mortem histopathological analysis of a liver biopsy of a COVID-19 patient microvesicular liver steatosis was observed (Xu et al. 2020a, b) . Even though this finding needs to be confirmed in larger studies, it has also been demonstrated that patients suffering from COVID-19 exhibited increased serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (Huang et al. 2020) , which is a chemokine known to exacerbate steatohepatitis (Gao and Tsukamoto 2016) . Consequently, pre-disposing factors for developing steatohepatitis, such as intake of steatosis-inducing drugs (e.g. sodium valproate, amiodarone, tamoxifen and methotrexate) (Boeckmans et al. 2018) , could play a role in combined COVID-19 and DILI. Knowing that liver dysfunction and NAFLD are more common in the elderly, who are also more prone to develop severe COVID-19, it is probably wise to carefully monitor COVID-19 patients for drug treatment that could lead to DILI.",

Relatively simple human-relevant cell models can be used to evaluate hepatotoxic properties of (novel) drugs in a relatively short time. This has been robustly demonstrated for a large series of compounds (Rodrigues et al. 2016; Kuna et al. 2018) . Also co-morbidities such as NAFLD that increase the risk for developing DILI can be modeled using in vitro methodology (Massart et al. 2017; Boeckmans et al. 2019) . Recently, Huh7 and Vero E6 cells in culture have been used to assess the pharmacological effects of remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, all potential anti-COVID-19 treatments under study Wang et al. 2020) . Hence, in vitro methodologies can be easily explored for increasing our knowledge with respect to the pharmacological concern and concomitant toxicological aspects of COVID-19 treatment.",
