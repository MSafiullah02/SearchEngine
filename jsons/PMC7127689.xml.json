Because the clinical and pathologic presentations of diseases caused by C perfringens types are not always distinct, anaerobic culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping of the isolates can be instrumental in determining the subtype involved and can help identify specific control measures. Each of the subtypes of C perfringens is associated with specific disease syndromes that are directly or indirectly related to the toxins they produce. The term enterotoxemia is often loosely used to describe enteric or systemic disease caused by any of the C perfringens toxinotypes. The term enterotoxemia refers to systemic disease caused by absorption of a toxin from the intestine. Clostridial abomasitis and enteritis does not require absorption of the toxins. The term enterotoxemia is best reserved for cases in which systemic disease is associated with absorption of bacterial exotoxins, including hemolytic diseases in lambs with C perfringens type A, and systemic disorders caused by the epsilon toxin of C perfringens types B and D. Some of the disease conditions described for C perfringens are listed in Table 2\n.",

Hydrolysis of lecithin by alpha -toxin produces diacylglycerol, which leads to stimulation of eukaryotic cell phospholipases and the arachidonic acid cascade.8, 23 This process can result in alterations in vascular permeability, platelet aggregation, and vasoconstriction. Alpha toxin has been shown to cause alterations in fluid transport within ileal and colonic loops in sheep.24 Alpha toxin likely acts in concert with additional virulence factors, resulting in intestinal mucosal damage and, in particular, the C perfringens toxin perfringolysin (theta toxin) seems to work synergistically with alpha toxin in calves.25, 26\n",

C perfringens abomasitis is a sporadic disorder of neonatal to weanling calves, lambs, and kids.15, 45, 47, 49, 52 The condition is common in both dairy and beef calves and seems to be less common in lambs and kid goats. Clinical signs include decreased nursing, lethargy, fluid distension of the abomasum, abdominal tympany, colic, and bruxism.49 Animals generally have a normal temperature unless complications of systemic sepsis or peritonitis have developed, in which case their temperature can be decreased or increased. Mucous membranes may be pale with a prolonged capillary refill time indicating systemic shock. Hydration status is often normal in acute cases but dehydration can develop in animals that are not treated soon. Abdominal distension with a succussion splash is a predominant and consistent clinical sign (Fig. 1\n). The ability of C perfringens to produce gas contributes to gastric dilatation and intramural emphysema evident in affected animals. Abomasal tympany and the associated abdominal distension also causes respiratory difficulty because of pressure placed on the diaphragm. Abomasal distension can also result in hemodynamic effects that can lead to shock. The case fatality rate of clostridial abomasitis seems to be high when rapid treatment is not instituted (75%\u2013100%).15, 45, 47, 48, 49, 51\n",

Clinical signs include acute onset of decreased appetite with right side or bilateral ventral abdominal distension (Fig. 4A). The animals may have a fever or be afebrile. Inflammatory changes to the complete blood count (CBC) are often absent but may be present because of translocation of enteric Gram-negative bacteria and secondary septicemia. Hemorrhagic diarrhea may not be apparent at the time of presentation (Fig. 4B) but may be apparent later in the course of the disease (Fig. 4D). Abdominal ultrasonography often reveals multiple loops of fluid-distended small intestine up to 5 cm in diameter (Fig. 4C). Intestinal motility is often decreased or lacks coordinated peristalsis. Scant feces may be noted upon rectal examination in early cases. The clinical signs are often difficult to discriminate from intestinal obstruction caused by intussusception, entrapment, or obstructing HBS. C perfringens type A can be cultured from affected small intestine and these animals often respond to treatment directed toward intraluminal clostridial infection. At this time, it is unclear whether this is an enteritis condition distinct from HBS or part of a continuum of enteric disease caused by C perfringens type A that includes HBS.",

The organism is easily grown in vitro; C perfringens type A grows rapidly in anaerobic culture and may overgrow other potential pathogens.65 Although quantitative culture is considered helpful in discriminating normal flora from overgrowth, a recent study in veal calves showed no difference in bacterial counts between normal veal calves and veal calves with clostridial enteritis.84 Diagnosis of clostridial abomasitis or enteritis therefore requires a combination of observations that may include:\u2022Observation of abdominal distension with colic.\u2022The presence of hemorrhagic abomasitis or enteritis (see Figs. 2B and 3).

If the distension is severe enough that it is compromising respiration, then percutaneous decompression of the abomasum can be performed. This decompression is best done with the animal in dorsal or left lateral recumbency (Fig. 6\n).85 The area of tympany is localized and quickly clipped and prepared for an aseptic procedure. A percutaneous abomasocentesis can then be performed using a 16-gauge to 20-gauge, 38-mm (1.5-inch) needle inserted directly through the skin into the abomasum. An extension set can be attached to the needle. Allow the gas to freely escape while placing slight pressure on the abdomen.

Because the animals typically have ileus and abdominal distension, oral fluids, including milk, are not indicated until the distension is resolved (generally 12\u201324 hours). IV fluids provide systemic support in treatment of the hypovolemic or maldistributive shock that is often observed in these patients. Some animals with clostridial enteritis do not show significant clinical dehydration, most likely because of the rapid effects of the toxins. Shock fluid rates are 80 mL/kg, and can be divided into one-quarter doses given to effect at intervals of 15 to 30 minutes. Once the shock has been addressed, the fluid rate can be decreased to a maintenance rate of 3 mL/kg/h. Dextrose (5%) can also be provided in the maintenance fluids, because milk is likely to be withheld for 12 to 24 hours. Many animals with clostridial enteritis show mild to moderate hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis caused by the intestinal ileus and delayed abomasal emptying. Thus, isotonic sodium chloride is a suitable initial fluid type to resolve the hypochloremic alkalosis if present. Animals in later stages of the disease may show metabolic acidosis and require the addition of sodium bicarbonate to fluids. IV fluids can be changed to a balanced electrolyte solution after resolution of the shock, or within the first 12 hours.",

The challenge is that the bacteria reside within the lumen so antimicrobial treatment must be selected such that an appropriate antimicrobial is delivered to the lumen of the abomasum and small intestine. Many antimicrobials are effective against C perfringens. Penicillin is one of the most effective antibiotics at killing C perfringens; however, penicillin does not immediately kill the bacteria. During the initial phase, the bacteria may continue to produce and release lethal exotoxins.86 Further, systemically administered penicillin is excreted via the renal system and is minimally excreted or secreted into the GI tract. Thus, oral procaine penicillin G (22,000 IU/kg, by mouth, every 24 hours for 3\u20135 days) may be recommended for treatment and has been used by the authors. Most C perfringens isolates are susceptible to oxytetracycline. Oxytetracycline is a bacteriostatic agent that inhibits protein synthesis. Oxytetracycline reduces C perfringens toxin production in vitro more rapidly than penicillin.86 Systemically administered oxytetracycline is partially excreted through the liver and biliary system and enters the lumen of the GI tract through the common bile duct. Both oral penicillin and systemic or oral oxytetracycline, alone or in combination, have been found to be clinically effective in treating acute cases of clostridial enteritis at Colorado State University (authors\u2019 personal experience).

Both kaolin-pectin and bismuth subsalicylate could have clinical benefit in treating the damaged mucosal epithelium. Kaolin in Kaopectate is a potent activator of the extrinsic clotting cascade and may help decrease intestinal blood loss in cases with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis.

In addition, GI ulceration can occur from the primary disease process, and this could be exacerbated by use or overuse of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as flunixin meglumine or meloxicam. A low dose of flunixin meglumine, as is used to treat the effects of Gram-negative sepsis (0.25 mg/kg IV every 6 hours or 0.3 mg/kg IV every 8 hours) may be preferable to using the labeled cattle dose (up to 2.2 mg/kg IV every 24 hours). Opioids are an alternative selection for pain control but can decrease GI motility and should therefore be used cautiously in cases of suspected clostridial gastroenteritis. However, use of butorphanol intramuscularly (0.02\u20130.1 mg/kg every 6\u20138 hours) or as a constant rate infusion (CRI) (13 \u03bcg/kg/h) in horses with anterior enteritis is reported to have minimal effects on GI motility.91 As with all drugs used extralabel in food-producing species, the Food Animal Residue Avoidance Databank (www.farad.org) should be consulted for a meat and/or milk withdrawal time before the administration of any of these agents.",

Distended hemorrhagic small intestine without intraluminal obstruction is observed (see Fig. 4C). During surgery, intestinal samples can be obtained at surgery for bacterial culture, genotyping, and cytology if indicated. Treatment can be initiated intraoperatively with intraluminal injections of penicillin.

In another study, antibody titers to epsilon toxin of C perfringens type D were induced in sheep immunized with a 2-dose series of a multivalent (8-way) clostridial vaccine.96 Immunization of ewes 3 weeks before lambing has been shown to induce colostral antibody titers against epsilon toxin that were adequate to impart protection of lambs for up to 12 weeks of age.97 In that study, adding a 2-dose immunization of the lambs at either days 1 and 21 of age or days 21 and 42 of age did not significantly change the titer of passively protected lambs. Immunization of lambs from vaccinated ewes (that do not have failure or suspected failure of passive transfer) with a C perfringens C and D and tetanus toxoid is recommended at 8 to 12 weeks of age and again 3 to 4 weeks later.94 Feeder lambs (and ideally replacement ewe lambs) can also receive a booster before entering the feedlot or being placed on a high-grain ration.94\n",

The investigators concluded that this 4-month gap between the first and second immunizations may not be optimal for herds in which clostridial diseases occur in preweaned calves, and alterations in management and/or vaccination schedule would be warranted in such cases. In another study, immunization of colostrum-fed calves (from immunized dams) at 3 weeks of age with a single-dose clostridial bacterin-toxoid did not significantly affect type C or D antitoxin titers over the first 4 months of life; however, significant differences in antitoxin titers among different vaccines were apparent.100\n",

As a result, some animals may receive multiple (predicted as many as 6) clostridial vaccinations before marketing, potentially compounding problems with injection site reactions in carcasses.104 When administered subcutaneously twice to feedlot calves, a 7-way clostridial vaccine induced significant reduction in feed intake after the second immunization and larger injection site lesions than did a C perfringens type C and D toxoid.104\n",

Autogenous C perfringens type A vaccines can also be used. The efficacy of these vaccines for C perfringens is still not established.
