The GS examiners were the most experienced as they had performed a modified Sarnat (>100 examinations) for study patients on all previous hypothermia trials.7,15,16 In addition, the GS examiners attended the yearly Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Health and Child Health and Development (NICHD) workshop central training meetings and certified all the remaining attending neonatologists per the institution protocol. This encompassed multiple concomitant examinations followed by a test of two matching examination forms on all items and a subsequent yearly hands on refresher and teaching lecture. Since our site was participating in the ongoing NICHD preemie 33\u201335 weeks\u2019 hypothermia randomized trial,15 additional education was provided to all neonatologists prior to study participation and refreshed on yearly basis to incorporate preterm physiological gestational differences into the neurological examination. Therefore, all examiners were instructed that preterm tone assessment should be focused on the response to passive movement in the lower extremities, while the Moro reflex should evaluate extension of limbs, opening of hands, and extension with abduction but not flexion of the upper extremities.",

The detailed analysis of encephalopathy as required by the modified Sarnat examination is limited by what can be elicited in a neurologic examination at each level of gestational maturation of the infant.19 Late and moderately preterm infants have developmental differences in primitive reflexes, tone, and posture that are controlled by the degree of prematurity and thus can confound the interpretation of the Sarnat score. Flexor posture in the lower extremities is present by 32 weeks\u2019 gestation but only gradually evolves in the upper extremities until present at \u226536 weeks\u2019 gestation.20 Similarly, the Moro reflex may be incomplete until 37 weeks\u2019 gestation since the anterior flexion of the upper extremities may be absent in younger gestational age infants. Pupillary reaction to light begins to appear at 30 weeks\u2019 gestation but is not present consistently until approximately 32\u201335 weeks\u2019 gestation.

This phenomenon was seen irrespective of the experience of the examiners and is consistent with reports using other neurologic scales.20\u201323 In those studies, when compared to term infants, late and moderately preterm infants had less mature performances in several items, including less axial tone with substantial head lag, less flexor tone, and less spontaneous activity. In addition, provider and knowledge-based diversity can contribute to subjectivity when performing the neurological exam.24 In order to overcome clarity issues and ensure reliability, examiners should be trained by certified GS examiners who ideally have participated in evidence-based studies utilizing that assessment, as was done in the current study. While the focus on the examination to be performed by trained and certified attending physicians added to the rigor of the study, it is important to note that study findings are likely to overestimate agreement if compared to a clinical setting outside of standardized protocols. Another issue affecting the assessment of reliability is the lower frequency of preterm infants with fetal acidosis necessitating a Sarnat examination. For instance, at our institution the experienced GS examiners screen approximately 50 term infants with fetal acidosis yearly with a neurological examination, which is 10-fold higher than the average of 3\u20135 per year born with fetal acidosis at 32\u201335 weeks\u2019 gestation who require such examination.",
