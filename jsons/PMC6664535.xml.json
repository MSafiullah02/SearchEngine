In-hospital fatality rate during 2017\u20132018 was significantly higher in over 60 years than in previous seasons, with a predominant number of infections due to influenza B and A/H1N1 compared with A/H3N2. Hospitalizations during the 2017\u20132018 epidemic were predominantly due to B viruses as indicated by early nationwide surveillance reports [5]. A predominant number of H3N2 hospitalizations occurred during late summer and autumn months of August\u2013October 2017 prior to the observation of H1N1 and B cases, coinciding with reports of the H3N2 summer epidemic in southern China [18] where seasonality is bimodal [19]. The significantly larger number of influenza hospitalized cases from 2017 to 2018 might be attributed to higher detection rate and more frequent turnover time of beds. A significantly larger number of hospitalized patients during 2017\u20132018 did not receive antiviral therapy within 48 h from symptom onset, and a higher number of these patients died, In addition, we found that inpatients with influenza during the 2017\u20132018 season were more frequently smoking than the 2011\u20132017 seasons, recognizing the increased risk of smoking during influenza epidemics and pandemics [20].

Following the standardization of influenza treatment with oseltamivir, the clinical demand for oseltamivir increased greatly, and medical institutions, pharmacy terminals and families of drug buyers all stocked oseltamivir in the short term, resulting in insufficient supply in the short-term in China [21]. Oseltamivir is the preferred treatment for younger patients, owing to shortage of manpower in the pediatric departments and the emotions of parents, and this also contributed to the abuse of oseltamivir [22]. More data and rationale are needed to define whether the insufficient supply of oseltamivir in adults (> 14 years) may have increased risk for death during influenza outbreak in China. Stockpiling of Tamiflu\u00ae (oseltamivir) against pandemic threats has been initiated by several countries, with Britain for example pushing ahead with its plan of stockpiling Tamiflu at \u00a349 m (\u20ac60 m; $80 m) to maintain its stockpile of antivirals in case of a flu pandemic [23].",

Age, gender, and underlying health conditions should be considered when planning influenza vaccination and treatment strategies [31]. Risk factors for death during the 2017\u20132018 season were mainly associated with complications: pulmonary complications were most common, but included secondary bacterial pneumonia in children and ARDS in adults [32]. Respiratory failure, ALI and secondary bacterial infection were common pulmonary complications during the 2017\u20132018 season.",

However, this limitation does not have an effect on the comparison of different influenza seasons. Because the number of influenza patients had increased significantly in 2017/18 season, and hospital beds are limited and stable, only more severe patients can be admitted to the hospital this season. We may had overestimated the in-hospital fatality in 2017/18 season due to the selection bias. Our study focused on infection due to types and subtypes of seasonal influenza viruses during the 2011\u20132018, however comparison to other respiratory infections such as the respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus should be further explored to better understand pathogenesis due to influenza viruses. Additionally, due to the collection of data from five different hospitals, inherent differences in practice and training over time may have had a bias in case selection. Finally, we did not include cases of mixed infections (the mixed infection of influenza A/H1N1 and influenza B; the mixed infection of influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and cases of influenza A that were not specified classified, so data on these cases could have some impact on our results.",

Disseminated intravascular coagulation and acute respiratory distress syndrome were significant predictors for die risk during 2017\u20132018 influenza seasons.
