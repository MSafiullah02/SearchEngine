All eukaryotic cells require the function of RNA helicases in all processes involving RNA (Jankowsky and Jankowsky, 2000, Linder, 2006, Linder and Jankowsky, 2011). To date, the activity of 13 host-encoded helicases and three virus-encoded RNA helicases in virus biology has been documented (Table 19.1\n). The scope of activities in all steps of viral replication and the interface with the antiviral host response demonstrates their remarkable versatility and potential utility as antiviral targets (Jeang and Yedavalli, 2006, Linder and Jankowsky, 2011, Ranji and Boris-Lawrie, 2010).",

In some viral infections, RNA helicase activity benefits the virus by promoting viral gene expression and squelching the antiviral response. In others, RNA helicase activity benefits the host by sensing viral nucleic acid and triggering antiviral response. The mechanisms that explain the versatility of RNA helicases are important to define but poorly understood. Experiments to determine the role of RNA helicases in viral replication are the focus of this chapter and stand from the perspective of the virus. We address RNA helicase activity in the steps of viral replication: gene expression, morphogenesis, and replication of viral nucleic acid. The complete elucidation of the role of RNA helicases in viral replication and the pathogenesis of disease is a priority in biomedical research.",

Some RNA helicases exhibit processive, ATP-dependent unwinding activity on nucleic acid, while others unwind RNA duplexes in a nonprocessive but also ATP-dependent fashion (Linder and Jankowsky, 2011). RNA helicases have also been shown to remodel ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs; Fuller-Pace, 2006, Jankowsky and Bowers, 2006, Linder, 2006, Linder et al., 2001). RNP remodeling can be accomplished independent of duplex unwinding (Jankowsky and Bowers, 2006). In addition, RNA helicases can function as binding partners of other proteins, and these interactions are not always dependent on catalytic helicase or ATPase activities (see Chapter 16).",
