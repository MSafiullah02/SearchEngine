One signifi cant limitation of this assay to its wider use across many types of enveloped viruses, such as coronavirus, has been incorporating non-lipid receptors (proteins) into the supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) used to monitor membrane fusion. Here, we describe a method for incorporating a proteinaceous viral receptor, feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN), into SLBs using cell blebbing of mammalian cells expressing fAPN in the plasma membrane. This receptor binds feline coronavirus (FECV 1683). We describe how to carry out single particle tracking of FECV fusion in this SLB platform to obtain fusion kinetics.",

There are a number of advantages of using this platform. First, the TIRFM imaging approach allows one to obtain unique single particle data that can be used to discriminate individuals within populations and to identify intermediate mechanistic steps of the entry process that are often masked by ensemble approaches. Second, microfl uidic handling enables unique control over the temporal sequence of fusion triggers such as viral binding, exposure to proteases, and pH drop. Third, the supported lipid bilayer that coats the walls of microfl uidic channels and acts as a host membrane mimic [ 4 , 5 ] preserves lipid mobility in the bilayer while its planar geometry removes many experimental complications imposed by live cells. These features facilitate the study of virus-cell interactions and the membrane fusion processes required for viral infection. This convenient platform enables quantitative data collection used for statistical analysis of stochastic virus fusion events and the measurement of membrane fusion kinetics.",

This limitation is imposed by the complexity of the receptor that can be incorporated into the SLB. As such, these platforms have been limited to the study of a few viruses, such as infl uenza virus [ 2 , 3 , 6 ] , Sindbis virus [ 3 ] , and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [ 7 ] , that are all known to interact with specifi c lipids that are easily incorporated into SLBs. However, the receptors for many enveloped viruses, including those in the Coronaviridae , are membrane proteins. In this chapter, we describe a method to incorporate membrane proteins into supported planar bilayers for the study of coronavirus fusion using single particle tracking by TIRFM. Here, we focus on one of the best-characterized receptors used by many coronaviruses in the alphacoronavirus genus [ 8 -10 ] , aminopeptidase N (APN).",

            "text": "To provide some perspective, we summarize standard procedures for creating proteoliposomes that can be used to form supported bilayers. Proteins are typically incorporated into vesicles using detergent to solubilize the membrane protein of interest, which is then reconstituted into a vesicle called a proteoliposome [ 11 ] . When membrane proteins are solubilized, they are extracted from their native lipid environment, which can expose the hydrophobic transmembrane domains to an aqueous environment. To minimize these energetically unfavorable interactions, the proteins may refold and lead to the incorporation of misfolded proteins into proteoliposomes. The reconstitution process can also lead to randomly oriented proteins in the bilayers. These non-native changes have major implications for pathogenesis: protein conformation in the membrane and its glycosylation are critical to controlling the host-pathogen interaction. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a method of embedding functional, enzymatically active membrane proteins in supported bilayers by using chemically induced cell blebbing [ 12 -15 ] to create proteoliposomes composed of plasma membrane constituents [ 16 , 17 ] .",

Cells are fi rst transfected with receptor proteins specifi c for coronaviruses (or any desired protein), grown to confl uency, and then chemically induced to form blebs. To form the planar bilayers, the cell blebs are fi rst adsorbed to a glass surface, and then incubated with liposomes devoid of proteins, but closely matching the lipid composition of the host cell. The rupturing of the liposomes in spaces in between adsorbed blebs induces the rupture of the cell blebs on the surface to form a single planar bilayer [ 16 ] . We showed previously [ 17 ] that APN in the SLB made from blebs is enzymatically active, oriented properly, and competent to bind CoV prior to membrane fusion. Note that the blebbing procedure applies to many cell types and we have successfully expressed other proteins and incorporated them into SLBs using this approach, including DPP4, the receptor for MERS-CoV. 3.

To analyze data and obtain fusion kinetics, import this data into data analysis software such as Matlab to determine the time at which the maximum intensity (hemifusion) or intensity drop (pore formation) occurs for each fusing particle. These data can then be analyzed in various ways to determine kinetics parameters associated with the fusion process. One commonly used method plots the data as cumulative distributions and fi ts with a gamma distribution [ 6 ] . In this approach, the number of steps in the kinetic process can be resolved and the rate constant for the limiting step. For pH sensitive fusion, these values can vary with the pH of buffer used to initiate fusion. Once the bulk quenching concentration has been obtained the optimal quenching conditions in the microfl uidic should be close to that obtained in the fl uorimeter. Further optimization may be required as a result of photobleaching.",

Dissolve all components except sphingomyelin in biotechnology grade chloroform before mixing in a scintillation vial. Dissolve sphingomyelin in a 4:1 mixture of chloroform-methanol. 2. Remove the bulk solvent from the vial under a stream of high purity nitrogen gas and then place in a desiccator under vacuum overnight to ensure complete evaporation of all solvent. Protect the lipids and fl uorophores from the degradation by room lighting, by wrapping the dessicator in aluminum foil or a dark cloth. 3. Add phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4 to the dried lipid fi lm and gently resuspend in a sonicating bath for twenty minutes on the lowest setting. The fi nal lipid concentration should be approximately 2 mg/ml. 4. Extrude the liposomes fi ve times through a 100 nm polycarbonate fi lter and then twice through a 50 nm polycarbonate fi lter. The average liposome diameter is typically 100 nm as determined by dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer Nano Z, Malvern).1. Internal virus labeling: Working in a biosafety hood thaw a vial of coronavirus on ice. Add 10 \u00b5l of 20 mM SRB dye to 20 \u00b5l of coronavirus. Allow the virus/SRB mixture to incubate for 16-20 h ( see Note 4 ). 2. Dilute the SRB-labeled coronavirus with 250 \u00b5l of GPMV buffer in a microcentrifuge tube. Vortex gently for 30 s to mix. Add 2 \u00b5l of TPCK-trypsin (2.5 \u00b5g/ml) to the virus/buffer mixture and vortex again for 30 s. Place the tube in a water bath or heat block at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min.",

Cell blebbing is not restricted to BHK-21 cells; a variety of cell lines can be used. Cell blebbing. There are a number of ways in which the cells can be incubated during blebbing. Agitation is not strictly required and blebs can be produced at 37 \u00b0C if the incubation time is increased to 2 h. Another very effective method is to place the plates in a thin layer of water shaker/heating bath at 37 \u00b0C and incubate for 1 h.4. Timing of experiment. Microfl uidic devices and BHKF liposomes may be prepared days or weeks in advance of the experiment so long as they are stored appropriately. Piranha cleaned glass coverslips should not be used more than 24 h after cleaning. For dual labeling experiments with the coronavirus should be incubated with SRB at least 16 h before co labeling with a lipophilic fl uorophore such as R110C18. Once the virus has been labeled, the fl uorescent probes will only stay stably associated with the virus for several hours.5. Optimization of virus labeling. When a new batch of dye is synthesized or new bath of virus is obtained it can be necessaryto re optimize the amount of R110C18 required to achieve suffi cient dequenching at a single particle level. Typically to optimize the dye concentration, bulk dequenching events should be carried out in a fl uorimeter. Incubate the virus with varying amounts of dye and fi lter. Add the labeled virus to a cuvette and take a baseline reading at the appropriate wavelength for the dye being used. To check if the virus is quenched, add 100 \u00b5l of a 10 % solution of Triton-X detergent. A significant and rapid increase in fl uorescence indicates that the virus was quenched before solubilization of the membrane by the detergent.",
