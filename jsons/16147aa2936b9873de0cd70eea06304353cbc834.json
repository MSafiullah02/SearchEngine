Bats are believed to be the natural hosts of the disease that was transmitted to humans through an intermediate host. 1 Genomic sequencing revealed a pathogen of coronavirus family similar to coronavirus related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). 2 The new virus was initially referred to as novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, then as SARS-CoV-2 virus by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. 3 This virus possesses higher transmissibility potential compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, resulting in a \"public health emergency crisis of international concern.\" 4 The infection is believed to transmit to humans through fomites, person-to-person contact, aerosol, and droplets. 2, 5, 6 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this viral outbreak a pandemic affecting 693,224 individuals in 202 countries and territories, with a total of 33,106 confirmed deaths by March 30, 2020. 7,8 The highest number of reported cases were in the United States, with the total number doubled in less than 5 days reaching 122,653 confirmed cases. 8, 9 The highest reported deaths was in Italy reaching 10,781 deaths out of 97,689 confirmed cases with 11% mortality rate. 8 Individuals confirmed with coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID- 19) develop symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection including fever, coughing, sneezing, vomiting, generalized fatigue and sever pneumonia. 10, 11 The disease onset could be mild, moderate, sever or critical. Symptoms among infected individuals vary from being asymptomatic to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ failures in critical cases with high reported deaths. 12 Several studies have reported cross-transmission of COVID-19 among healthcare workers.",

Furthermore, several studies reported asymptomatic carriers including children, who comprises a high percentage of orthodontic patients, which elevates the risk on the orthodontic team even higher. 5, 14, 19 Although, cross-transmission of COVID-19 within a dental facility has not been reported so far, however taking into consideration the recent onset of the disease and deficiency in data, the risk is still elevated. Previous studies have reported cross-transmission of infection within the dental facilities including Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. [20] [21] [22] [23] In the United States, orthodontists are ranked the second highest incidence to acquire Hepatitis B. [24] [25] [26] Meng et al. reported 9 confirmed cases of COVID-19 within ental team members at the School and Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University (SHSWH). 27 While this was possibly an infection from an outside source other than the dental facility, those infected personnel could be contagious during their latency period and infect other team members or patients visiting the dental clinic.

[31] [32] [33] Moreover, aerosol containing microbes was found to reach as far as 2 meters from the patient's mouth, with the highest concentrations reported the furthest away from the patient is. 34 This means microbes could contaminate surfaces throughout the operatory. A study performed using a florescence dye with high-speed handpiece found that the fluorescence dye reached more than 2 feet from the dental chair. The dye was even found in the noses of the operator and assistant, having penetrated their facial protective gear. 35 Another study reported trace of aerosol were found on operators' scrub jacket sleeves and chest area. 36 The aerosol could contaminate the dental unit waterline, resulting in the spread of infection. 37 Aerosols containing germs of 0.5-10 micrometers or less have the ability to remain airborne longer, increasing the risk of being inhaled and entering deeper areas of lung, posing a potential infectious hazard. 38 This collectively presents an alarming threat with the highly contagious COVID-19.",

Given the high transmissibility of COVID-19, controlling aerosol and human-to-human contact while limiting treatment to emergency cases is advised during the outbreak. It is the responsibility of the orthodontic team to ensure safety and stop crosscontamination within the clinical facility. Finally, the impact of COVID-19 on the orthodontic practice, cost of illness and whether clear aligners that require minimal appointments are superior to fixed orthodontics in the event of a future outbreak, are questions remained to be answered.",
