The coronaviruses are a diverse family of enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses that are distributed widely among animal species (Lai and Holmes, 2001). The major surface glycoprotein, the spike (S) glycoprotein, mediates the attachment of virions to the host-cell receptor and the subsequent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The S glycoprotein is also the target of neutralizing antibodies and a major determinant of pathogenicity (Lai and Holmes, 2001).",

            "text": "The coronavirus S glycoproteins share similarities with other Class I viral fusion proteins in their apparent use of a six-membered \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structure to promote fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (Bosch et al., 2003, Chambers et al., 1990). Class I viral fusion proteins, such as those of the retroviruses, filoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and paramyxoviruses, contain two heptad-repeat regions, with a 3,4 periodicity in hydrophobic residues, that are poised to refold during virus entry to form a highly stable six-helix core (Eckert and Kim, 2001, Hughson, 1997, Skehel and Wiley, 2000, Weissenhorn et al., 1999, and references therein). In this structure, three \u03b1-helices formed by the C-terminal heptad repeats of the trimeric glycoprotein pack in an anti-parallel manner against conserved hydrophobic grooves on the surface of a central, three-stranded coiled coil formed by the N-terminal heptad repeats. Recent biophysical (Bosch et al., 2003, Ingallinella et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2004, Tripet et al., 2004) and, specifically, crystallographic (Duquerroy et al., 2005, Supekar et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2004b) studies of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein fusion domain have demonstrated a six \u03b1-helical core structure typical of Class I viral fusion proteins. In contrast to other viruses, however, only a short central portion of the SARS-CoV C-terminal heptad-repeat region assumes the \u03b1-helical form in the crystal structure (Fig. 1\n). The outlying heptad repeats appear as extended chains.",

A general model for Class I viral protein-induced membrane fusion posits that the native envelope glycoprotein exists in a metastable state and, upon activation by receptor binding and/or endosomal pH, undergoes a structural reorganization that leads to exposure of the previously constrained fusion subunit and insertion of its hydrophobic \u201cfusion peptide\u201d into the cellular membrane. In this prehairpin intermediate, the fusion subunit is anchored to the viral membrane via its transmembrane domain and to the cellular membrane via the fusion peptide. Collapse of this intermediate leads to a trimer-of-hairpins structure in which the N- and C-terminal heptad-repeat regions assemble as anti-parallel \u03b1-helices to form the six-helix bundle, thereby bringing the viral and cellular membranes into apposition. The free energy made available through formation of the highly stable helical bundle is thought to drive fusion of the lipid bilayers. Thus, the kinetics and thermodynamics of six-helix bundle formation are critical determinants of envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion.",

To assess the role of this six-helix structure in promoting membrane fusion, we subjected the C-terminal heptad-repeat region of the S glycoprotein from the Urbani isolate of SARS-CoV (Ksiazek et al., 2003) to scanning mutagenesis. Specifically, we focused on residues at a and d positions in the heptad repeats, as these hydrophobic sidechains contribute to interhelical knob-in-hole packing interactions that play a dominant role in stabilizing coiled-coil structures (Crick, 1953). These amino acids were individually replaced with serine, a polar residue that would be expected to disturb hydrophobic packing interactions while retaining good \u03b1-helix propensity (Chakrabartty et al., 1994). Previous studies of the murine coronavirus S glycoprotein suggested that less severe substitutions with individual alanine residues, a small helix-forming amino acid that contributes minimally to hydrophobicity, were insufficient to disrupt six-helix bundle packing (Luo et al., 1999).",

Metabolically labeled cells were lysed in cold Tris\u2013saline buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and S glycoproteins were isolated via an S-peptide (Spep) affinity tag (Kim and Raines, 1993) at the cytoplasmic C-terminus and S-protein agarose (Novagen). The Spep addition is innocuous with regard to S glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion (not shown), in keeping with reports of other C-terminal tags (Bisht et al., 2004, Bosch et al., 2004, Moore et al., 2004). The glycoproteins were then eluted in NuPAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) and reducing agent and resolved using NuPAGE 3\u20138% Tris\u2013acetate gels. As shown in Fig. 2\n, each of the wild-type and mutant glycoproteins was expressed to yield the terminally glycosylated glycoprotein of approximately 220 kDa molecular weight, as well as an immature, Endo H-sensitive form of 200 kDa (Bisht et al., 2004, Song et al., 2004 and K.E.F. and J.H.N, unpublished). The 220-kDa form of the mutant S glycoproteins appeared to migrate somewhat slower than that of the wild type, suggesting a subtle change in terminal glycosylation. Upon deglycosylation with peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England BioLabs), all migrated uniformly at the expected 140-kDa molecular weight of the S polypeptide (not shown). As has been reported by others (Bisht et al., 2004, Simmons et al., 2004, Song et al., 2004, Xiao et al., 2003), we found no evidence of proteolytic maturation of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein to form discrete S1 and S2 subunits. Expression levels of all the mutant S glycoproteins were generally similar to the wild type, with the exception of A1172S, which was reduced. Higher molecular-weight forms of the glycoproteins were also observed to variable degrees among the wild-type and mutant samples (Fig. 2 and below).",

Cell-surface binding of the mutant glycoproteins by other S glycoprotein-directed MAbs (viz., F26G6, F26G8, and F26G19; Berry et al., 2004) was also similar to that of the wild type (not shown). These four MAbs recognize predominantly linear epitopes in the S1 domain (Berry et al., 2004; K.E.F. and J.H.N, unpublished), and thus binding reflects the amount of cell-surface glycoprotein more so than its conformational integrity. Nonetheless, the consistency in cell-surface fluorescence is suggestive of similar transport and presentation. Taken together, these data indicate that none of the serine substitutions markedly affected the biosynthesis or transport to the cell surface of the mutant S glycoproteins.",

COS-7 cells expressing the S glycoproteins were co-cultured with COS-7 cells expressing the cell surface receptor of the SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Li et al., 2003). Cell\u2013cell fusion was detected by the induced expression in syncytia of the \u03b2-galactosidase reporter. Cell\u2013cell fusion by the wild-type and mutant S glycoproteins was entirely dependent on expression of the ACE2 receptor (not shown; Li et al., 2003, Xiao et al., 2003). In these experiments, the ability of the S glycoproteins to mediate ACE2-dependent cell\u2013cell fusion varied markedly among the mutants (Fig. 4A). Substitutions at the termini of the heptad-repeat region had no effect on fusogenicity (viz. V1158S, L1179S, and L1182S) whereas more centrally located substitutions produced variable deficiencies ranging from 10% of wild-type activity (for L1168S) to \u224840% of wild-type activity (for I1161S and A1172S).",

In the crystal structure, the outlying residues (V1158S, L1179S, and L1182S) exist in an extended non-\u03b1-helical conformation of O-X-O repeats (Duquerroy et al., 2005, Ingallinella et al., 2004, Supekar et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2004b) and are not positioned to interact in a conventional knob-into-hole manner with the N-terminal coiled coil. Instead, both V1158 and L1179 utilize main-chain atoms to interact with asparagine and glutamine sidechains on the N-terminal coiled coil (Duquerroy et al., 2005). These interactions are likely undisturbed in the mutant glycoproteins. The convergence between the crystallographic structure of the six-helix bundle and those sidechains critical for membrane fusion provides strong evidence for the central importance of the \u03b1-helical bundle in SARS-CoV S glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion.",

Support for this conjecture may be gleaned from an analysis of the higher molecular-weight forms of the S glycoprotein (>500 kDa) shown in Fig. 2. These aggregates are stable at 70 \u00b0C to disulfide-bond reduction and LDS denaturation and vary in a consistent manner in the extent of their formation. In appearance and stability, these higher molecular-weight forms are reminiscent of the fusion-active oligomers of the avian leukosis retrovirus envelope glycoprotein that are induced upon receptor binding and acidic pH (Matsuyama et al., 2004, Mothes et al., 2000, Netter et al., 2004, Smith et al., 2004). Formation of such oligomers may also be triggered by non-physiological means, such as by treatment with nonionic detergent, heat, urea, or guanidium hydrochloride (Carr et al., 1997, Ruigrok et al., 1986, Wallin et al., 2004, Wallin et al., 2005). It is possible then that the higher molecular-weight forms observed in the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein represent post-fusion oligomers that provide a fortuitous measure of the relative stability of the wild-type and mutant six-helix bundles. In many of the fusion-deficient S glycoproteins (viz., I1161S, L1168S, A1172S, and L1175S), mutations that affect fusogenicity also affect the extent of formation (Fig. 2) and the thermal stability (not shown) of the higher molecular-weight forms. If borne out in biophysical studies, this interpretation lends additional support to the concept that the formation and stability of the six-helix bundle is intimately coupled to membrane fusion. The I1165S mutant in which fusogenicity is diminished despite the ample formation of the higher molecular-weight species suggests that other parameters may also be important.",

In that work, d positions in the C-terminal heptad repeats were replaced by alanine. Although single alanine substitutions were insufficient to affect cell\u2013cell fusion, double mutations were highly detrimental and these clustered specifically to the central heptad repeats, and not to the outlying repeats. There too, oligomer formation (as determined by sucrose gradient analysis) correlated with fusogenicity. Translating these early results to the recently determined structure of the MHV six-helix bundle (Xu et al., 2004a), which also reveals a short C-terminal helical region, confirms the notion that the \u03b1-helix bundle is an important determinant of S glycoprotein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion and, by extension, critical for viral entry.",

            "text": "Despite the central role of the six-helix bundle structure in promoting membrane fusion, the family of coronaviruses displays an unusual dimorphism in the length of its N- and C-terminal heptad-repeat regions. Coronaviruses that cluster within one serological and phylogenetic grouping, the Group 1 viruses that include the human respiratory isolate 229E and the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), contain two additional heptad repeats (14 amino acids) at the center of both N- and C-terminal heptad-repeat regions (Supekar et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2004b). It is likely that these inserts extend and increase the stability of the helical regions in these viruses, but biophysical and structural evidence for this suggestion is currently lacking. Interestingly, the S glycoproteins of established coronaviruses that contain the shorter heptad-repeat regions, specifically the Group 2 coronaviruses that include MHV and the bovine CoV, normally undergo proteolytic maturation during biosynthesis to form discrete receptor-binding (S1) and fusion (S2) subunits (Lai and Holmes, 2001). By contrast, the S glycoproteins of the Group 1 coronaviruses encoding the expanded heptad-repeat regions are not subjected to proteolytic cleavage. Although the newly emerged SARS-CoV encodes the shorter heptad-repeat regions and has been phylogenetically associated with the Group 2 coronavirus (Gibbs et al., 2004, Snijder et al., 2003), its S glycoprotein does not undergo proteolytic maturation. It is unknown what, if any, relationship exists in the coronaviruses between proteolytic cleavage, activation of the structural reorganization in the S glycoprotein, and formation of the six-helix bundle. The seemingly mixed provenance of the SARS-CoV may have important implications for coronavirus evolution and pathogenesis.",
