It is however quite known from the literature that the contactless fingerprint images deliver remarkably low matching accuracies as compared with those obtained from the contactbased fingerprint sensors. This paper develops a new approach to significantly improve contactless fingerprint matching capabilities available today. We systematically analyze the extent of complimentary ridge-valley information and introduce new approaches to achieve significantly higher matching accuracy over state-of-art fingerprint matchers commonly employed today. We also investigate least explored options for the fingerprint color-space conversions, which can play a key-role for more accurate contactless fingerprint matching. This paper presents experimental results from different publicly available contactless fingerprint databases using NBIS, MCC and COTS matchers. These consistently outperforming results also help to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for more accurate contactless fingerprint identification.",

            "text": "Biometric patterns offer the most reliable signatures to conveniently and securely establish human identities. These signatures are derived from the physiological and/or behavioral characteristics of respective individuals. Among several physiological traits accessible from the human body, finger ridge patterns have been widely employed in law enforcement departments to establish unique personal identity of suspects. The fingerprint features are formed before the birth, have high permanence and use of today's high-computing machines have made their use quite convenient and fast. The pervasiveness of fingerprint authentication can be conjectured by its use in the most ubiquitous devices i.e. smartphones. Moreover, there are a wide range of e-business applications like financial transactions or access to secured offices, which have increasingly relied on fingerprint authentication. However, till date, majority of the fingerprint-based systems use contact-based sensors, to acquire the fingerprint of any subject, i.e. these sensors require the subject to make a contact of his or her finger with the platen or surface of the sensors. Such contact-based acquisition poses new challenges relating to user convenience, hygiene and security threats. Contact-based requirement can be a serious threat to hygiene as there is a wide range of diseases, e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which are known to transmit or spread from unintended contacts. Therefore, the user's hygiene become vulnerable in such contact-based acquisition. The leftover or latent impressions on the surface of contact-based sensors not only interfere with the new acquisitions but are also known to pose security threat as these can be lifted to reconstruct spoof fingerprints for the presentation attacks.",

Several references [4] , [19] have investigated contactless fingerprint acquisition using mobile phones and specialized setups while many commercial contactless fingerprint sensors have also been recently emerged for deployments. Availability of contactless fingerprint databases [13] , [16] have also encouraged much needed further research in this area. Involuntary finger motion during the contactless fingerprint imaging can significantly degrade the matching accuracies and reference [7] has attempted to address such problem. Earlier work [2] , [9] , [16] , [19] in contactless 2D finger-print identification have largely incorporated image segmentation, enhancement or minutiae matching algorithms that have shown promising results for the contact-based fingerprints. Such direct use of contact-based fingerprint methods ignores the nature of image formation from con-tactless sensing and is therefore not adequate to utilize full potential from contactless fingerprint images. The duality of relationship between minutiae extracted from the contactless fingerprint images and contact-based fingerprints has been quite known [17] and considered during cross-sensor fingerprint matching. However, this paper for the first time analyzes such influence in the real contactless fingerprint databases and introduces alternative strategies to achieve significant performance improvements using the popular contact-based fingerprint matchers.",

However when these 3D surfaces are sensed using a contact-based fingerprint sensors, only its 2D projections are recorded. More precisely, when the subject touches the sensor platen with his or her finger, the topographic high points, which are known as the ridges, are imaged while the low points, known as the furrows or valleys, are not imaged as these are considered as part of the background. Figure 1 (a) illustrates the frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) principle, which is popularly employed in the legacy contact-based fingerprint sensors. It can be observed from this figure that the pixels corresponding to the light rays reflected from the low topographic regions, or the valleys of finger skin surface, have higher intensity (bright) in a fingerprint image. The spatial locations from high areas or ridges are rendered as darker regions in the fingerprint image. The same ridge and valley topologies have been correspondingly identified in Fig. 1 ",

            "text": "However the contrast between such gray-levels between the ridge and valley is remarkably different in the contactless acquisition (see Fig. 1 (c)) of the same finger surface. This difference can be attributed to the varying illumination on different topographic regions of the finger skin where the ridges are rendered as darker or brighter areas in those regions. Contactless acquisition is commonly followed by grayscale representation, or the binarization for the finger images, so that their appearance is similar to their legacy contact-based counterparts. Such second-order representation for the contactless fingerprints can significantly degrade the system's matching accuracy. A gray-level representation can be attributed to the variation in the illuminating angle, because of which the ridges are sometimes rendered as brighter and sometimes as darker than the adjacent valleys. One such instance is illustrated in Fig. 1(d) . In summary, the brighter and darker portions of a ridge in a contactless image are not consistent with ridge and valley. Instead, they are consistent with the opposite flanks of ridges. Such polarity reversal effect is quite common and can be attributed to the inter-action of incident illumination, with respect to the 3D ridge-valley structure [8] , [11] , during the contactless imaging. These gray-level alterations can be easily observed from the raw fingerprint images acquired in contactless manner. However, if the images are represented as grayscale, or even binarized to detect the potential minutiae points, this polarity reversal effect is completely lost. This is also the key reason for poor performance when the contactless images are matched against the legacy contact-based fingerprints. Our detailed observations reveal that the minutiae expected to be matched from contactless and contact-based images do not appear at same or similar positions. The ridge endings of contact-based fingerprint become ridge bifurcations in the contactless fingerprint and vice-versa. An instance of such changes in the type of minutiae is illustrated from a real finger image sample in Fig. 2 Such image formation mechanism during the contactless fingerprint acquisition motivated us to investigate additional information for the localization of minutiae from the input fingerprint image. Unlike the legacy contact-based fingerprint, in which the valley information is lost as it is considered as the part of background information, the contactless fingerprint imaging simultaneously recovers the ridge and valley inormation. However, this joint information is embedded with low-contrast as 3D ridges are imaged under uneven illuminations and under reflections from multiple ridges. In order to reveal additional minutiae from the otherwise dark portions of the contactless image and exploit the polarity alternation notion, we also investigate image transformations to precisely recover the minutiae. This work presents such systematic investigation, using publicly available contactless fingerprint image databases, and introduces possible solutions to address significant degradation in performance while matching contactless fingerprint images.",

In this figure, the top and bottom rows show the detected minutiae from raw and inverted contactless fingerprints, respectively. As can be observed from these images that most of minutiae detected from the raw contactless fingerprint are also present in the corresponding inverted fingerprint, just with a change in minutiae type. This explains for bifurcations of raw fingerprint appearing as terminations in the inverted images and vice-versa [20] . More importantly, it can also be clinched upon careful inspection of these images that many spurious minutiae, which are falsely detected from the raw fingerprints, remain undetected in their inverted counterparts. Additionally, the inverted fingerprint facilitates the detection of additional cores and deltas, which otherwise remain undetected from the raw fingerprints. For instance, the first image sample in the top row of Fig. 3 shows a sample fingerprint having two cores (i.e. u-shaped ridges) in the lower half of the image. However, the popular commercial offthe-shelf (COTS) tool, namely VeriFinger [12] , is only able to detect single core (shown by redcolored rectangle), while the other one remains unnoticed because of poor focus of the image. However, when the inverted fingerprint is provided as input to the same COTS tool, both the cores get detected (highlighted by two red-colored rectangles in the first image in bottom row). Similar observations can be made from the second and third image of Fig. 3 , where the cores of fingerprints are detected only when their inverted version is presented as input (see the red-colored rectangles in second and third images of bottom row). Moreover, the last fingerprint in top row Fig. 3 possesses a delta (i.e. a Y-shaped ridge), which can be observed with the bare eyes on the raw contactless image. However, this delta remains undetected because of the poor focus on this part of the finger, which can be attributed to the curved 3D profile of human fingers. On the other hand, the COTS tool was able to detect this delta from the inverted fingerprint image (red-colored triangle in last fingerprint of bottom row).",

The PolyU database [13] also provides a processed contactless fingerprint sub-dataset comprising of grayscale 350 \u00d7 225 pixel images.

The Luma representation of colored images can enable larger contrast as compared to the ordinary grayscale images, which facilitates the enhanced detection of minutiae features. This observation can also be noted from the instances of grayscale images shown in Fig. 4 . It is not difficult to observe that Luma grayscale images have increased contrast as compared to the ordinary grayscale images. It is evident from the first and second sample in Fig. 4 , that the delta singularity is appropriately detected in Luma grayscale images, while it is not detected in the ordinary grayscale images. Moreover, a careful visual inspection reveals the presence of many spurious minutiae, which are erroneously detected in the ordinary grayscale representation, gets suppressed in the Luma grayscale represented (refer to last column images of Fig. 4) images. Therefore, in order to add a new dimension to the enhancement for contactless fingerprint recognition, we performed experiments with Luma grayscale contactless fingerprint images, which were obtained by converting the unprocessed (colored) images of PolyU database to Luma grayscale and reducing their dimension to be same as that of the processed contactless fingerprints in the database i.e 350 \u00d7 225 pixels. Thereafter, the recognition experiments were also performed on the inverted versions of Luma grayscale images to present a comprehensive evaluation in the currently selected framework. These experimental results, with both the Luma grayscale images and their inverted counterparts, are discussed on the next section.",

This matcher uses two key modules, namely MINDTCT and BOZORTH3, for the minutiae detection and template matching respectively. It is open source, complies with the several standards, and employed widely in a range of law-enforcement applications. Therefore, it is employed to validate the effectiveness of our approach for the contactless fingerprint recognition. This matcher generates similarity scores while matching two minutiae templates. The maximum score obtained after matching intraclass fingerprint template lies in the interval of 300-325. Our experimental results on PolyU contactless fingerprint dataset, using NBIS matcher, are illustrated in Fig. 6(a) . The corresponding ROC curves illustrate that NBIS matcher achieves an EER of 13.33% and GAR (@FAR=0.01%) of 65.52% for legacy contactless fingerprints (i.e. with conventional ridge minutiae) in PolyU database. On the other hand, with the usage of inverted contactless fingerprints (i.e. valley minutiae), the observed EER is 14.14% and GAR (@FAR=0.01%) is 61.61%. Hence, it can be inferred that the NBIS matcher can achieve better results with the ridge-minutiae template matching rather than with the corresponding valleyminutiae based template matching. However, it is equally important to note that combination of scores from both scenarios of matching reflects the complementary nature of the inverted fingerprints. The experiments with NBIS on PolyU database also reveal that the matching accuracy from the normal contactless fingerprints is at par with that of the inverted fingerprints. The performance improvement from the combination of two template representations is significant and validates our arguments in section 3.",

From these values, it can be argued that matching the raw fingerprint images offers better EER, but worse GAR, when compared to those from matching the inverted fingerprint images.

The Minutiae Cylinder Code (MCC) [18] is widely considered as a state-of-art fingerprint matcher and therefore also utilized in our work.

In terms of performance metrics, experiments with the original contactless fingerprints yield an EER of 0.81% and GAR (@FAR=0.0001%) of 91.11%.

The performance metrics for these experiments (i.e. EER and GAR@FAR=0.001%) for original contactless fingerprints are 3.60% and 90.43%, respectively.

This argument is also well supported by the ROC curves illustrated in Figs. 6-8 on public contactless fingerprint databases. The key focus of this paper is on investigating the polarity reversal or alterations observed in the common contactless fingerprint images or databases for more accurate performance. A careful observation of the ROC curves of Figs. 6-8, indicated that the fusion of scores from the raw and inverted contactless fingerprints images almost always results in noticeable performance improvements. Such improvements in performance metrics as a result of simultaneous use of these two representations is summarized in Table 1 . The results summarized in this table clearly indicates that the minutiae information furnished from the inverted contactless fingerprints can surely aid to improve performance from the raw contactless fingerprints.",

The experimental results presented in this paper on two public contactless fingerprint databases [13] , [16] , using MCC [18] , NBIS [17] and COTS [12] matchers consistently illustrate significant improvement in the performance over the conventional approaches in the literature. The work detailed in this paper indicates that the grayscale polarity alterations under the ambient or indoor illumination is frequent and should be incorporated into the design of any effective matching strategy to utilize full potential from the contactless fingerprint images. Absence of contact between the sensor platen and the human finger often leads to varying illuminated areas in the fingerprint images. Therefore, the ridges in such images are often rendered as darker and brighter in different regions. This is unlike for the images from popular contactbased fingerprint sensors, in which the ridges are always rendered as darker and valleys as brighter, largely due to the frustrated total internal reflection. Simultaneous recovery and use of ridge and valley minutiae in the contactless fingerprints can enable superior matching capabilities by utilizing the potential from the inverted fingerprints, either individually or in combination with the raw fingerprints.",

On one hand, NBIS and MCC yield comparable performance for both ridge (raw fingerprints) and valley (inverted fingerprints) minutiae matching approaches. However, the combination of scores from raw and inverted fingerprints achieves significantly improved performance with both of these matchers as well. Significant performance improvement, in EER and ROC or GAR, due to such combination can validate our arguments. On the other hand, COTS matcher clearly illustrates improved performance with inverted fingerprints alone, which can further be improved through the score combination. This work also considered the effective conversion of contactless color fingerprint representation to its grayscale representation which has received almost nil attention in the literature. In this context, a more diversified grayscale representation, namely Luma grayscale, was introduced with quite encouraging results. Such effective grayscale representation is quite valuable for improving the performance from contactless fingerprints acquired using the widely popular color cameras on mobile phones. Contactless fingerprint acquisition for a range of mobile application requires its detection under complex or moving backgrounds and under involuntary finger motions. Such detection can be achieved using a faster-RCNN, similar to as illustrated in [6] for palmprint acquisition and is suggested for the further work.",
