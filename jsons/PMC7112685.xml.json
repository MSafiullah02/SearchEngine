            "text": "The interferons (IFNs) of vertebrates constitute the primary line of defense of host immune response against invading pathogens. These helical proteins are classified into type I (viral interferons), type II (immune interferon or IFN-\u03b3) and type III (IFN-\u03bb) interferons based on the amino acid sequence, chromosomal location and the specific receptors used for signaling (Pestka et al., 2004). Type I IFNs form the primary line of defense in the host immune response against viral pathogens which comprise of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03c9, IFN- \u03b5, IFN-\u03ba, IFN-\u03c4 and IFN-\u03b4 (de Weerd and Nguyen, 2012d). In the human genome, type I IFN genes are intronless and are arranged in tandem from IFNB to IFNE spanning a region of \u223c400 kb on the short arm of chromosome 9 (D\u00edaz et al., 1994; Roberts et al., 1998). The first primordial IFN gene is believed to have originated 500 million years ago and eventually diverged into IFNA and IFNB around 400 million years ago. The IFNA gene evolved again and duplicated many times to produce the multiple IFNA subtypes present in human and other animals (Gillespie and Carter, 1983). In mammals, IFN-\u03b1 is one of the major type I IFN proteins modulating the host immune response against viruses and is the only type I IFN used in therapeutic practice (Antonelli et al., 2015). Thirteen functional IFN-\u03b1 subtypes have been reported in human (Kuruganti et al., 2014). These are produced as precursor proteins with a 23 amino acid hydrophobic signal polypeptide at the N-terminus which is cleaved off before mature IFN-\u03b1 proteins are secreted from the cells. Four conserved cysteine residues are present in the mature proteins of all IFN-\u03b1 subtypes and are located at 1, 29, 99 and 139 positions in the protein sequence. Multiple IFNA genes have been reported in other domestic animals as well. Fourteen IFNA genes have been reported from porcine and the recombinant proteins exhibited antiviral activities against porcine viruses in-vitro (Cheng et al., 2006). Recombinant bovine IFN-\u03b1 showed antiviral activity to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (Li et al., 2010; Yanagida et al., 2004). IFNA genes have been identified from the horse and bacterially expressed recombinant equine IFN-\u03b1 exhibited antiviral effect against equine herpesvirus (Himmler et al., 1986; Steinbach et al., 2002). Thirteen IFN-\u03b1 subtypes were identified in mink, a fur producing animal and antiviral activity tested against vesicular stomatitis virus and canine distemper virus (Zhang et al., 2015). In wild animals, twelve IFNA genes have been identified in the giant panda, and the recombinant proteins tested for antiviral activity with VSV (Tan et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Camelids are a unique group of mammals with distinct immunology, the most important being the single-chain antibodies. Camelids originated in North America during the Eocene period and the present-day members have evolved to adapt to diverse challenging habitats ranging from hot deserts of Asia to cold high altitudes of South America. They are the only surviving members of the mammalian suborder Tylopoda and are represented by the Old World Camelids (the dromedary and the Bactrian camel) the New World camelids (alpaca, llama, guanaco, and vicu\u00f1a). Though considered a hardy species, the dromedary camel is still susceptible to many viral, bacterial and protozoan pathogens. One of the most contagious and infectious diseases affecting the dromedary camels is Camelpox. It is enzootic to every region of the world (except Australia), where camels are reared, and severely impact the economy of communities dependent on camels for milk, meat, transportation, and sport. This disease is caused by Camelpox virus (CMLV), belonging to the genus Orthopoxvirus of the Poxviridae family. Like many members of the poxviruses, CMLV is also host-restricted to a single host \u2013 Camelus species (Duraffour et al., 2011b). However recent reports of human infections in India, the Middle East, and Africa have pointed out the zoonotic threat of the camelpox virus (Bera et al., 2011; Khalafalla and Abdelazim, 2017). Although the CMLV vaccine has been developed, the disease is still prevalent since the vaccination is not widely used and only calves above six months of age are protected by vaccination. Identification of host immunomodulatory genes targeted by CMLV and development of antivirals for treatment have been suggested as key areas for research in Camelpox (Duraffour et al., 2011b). Dromedary camels are also reported to be the reservoir of another major zoonotic disease \u2013 the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and as a direct source of infection to humans (Gossner et al., 2016; Wernery et al., 2017).Type I interferons play an important role in the host response against MERS-CoV. Interaction of the MERS-CoV with the human antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and dendritic cells significantly induce the expression of type I and III IFNs, particularly IFN-\u03b1 (Scheuplein et al., 2015). IFN-\u03b12b treatment along with ribavirin is effective in treating MERS-CoV (Falzarano et al., 2013). There are no reports of IFN-\u03b1 from the dromedary camel or any other members of the mammalian family Camelidae in spite of its role in the dissemination of many zoonotic infections. For elucidation of the role of IFN-\u03b1 in these major emerging zoonotic viral infections, it is necessary to isolate and characterize these key immune genes from dromedary camel.",

N-linked glycosylation is predicted in a few murine IFN-\u03b1, four porcine IFN-\u03b1, two mink interferons and only human IFN-\u03b114, and none of the other IFN-\u03b1 subtypes. Since IFN-\u03b1 is intronless and does not need glycosylation for its activity, prokaryotically produced recombinant IFN-\u03b1 has been the first choice for commercial production. However prokaryotic expression of interferons in heterologous expression systems like E.coli poses other technical challenges like the presence of rare codons and formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. There were 22 rare codons in the mature protein-coding sequence of camel IFN-\u03b1 which severely hampered recombinant expression. Recombinant expression of the protein was improved after the usage of Rosetta 2 (DE3) strain of E.coli which supplemented the tRNAs for 19 of the 22 rare codons present (Supplementary Fig. S3 - A, B & C). When overexpressed in E.coli, recombinant human IFN-\u03b1 tends to form insoluble protein aggregates termed inclusion bodies, which are insoluble and do not exhibit biological activity (Babu et al., 2000). Prior to recombinant expression, we analyzed the mature protein sequence of the dromedary camel IFN-\u03b11 in PROSO-II (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/prosoII/), a sequence-based protein solubility evaluator. Recombinant camel IFN-\u03b11 was predicted to be insoluble when expressed in E.coli upon PROSO-II analysis and was later confirmed by small-scale expression studies. We used a purification strategy in which His6-tagged CdIFN-\u03b11 proteins in inclusion bodies were initially solubilized using 6 M GuHCl as a denaturing agent, captured on a His-affinity column and finally eluted out after on-column refolding (Supplementary Fig. 3D & E). Before use in in-vitro assays, to confirm the identity of recombinant protein as IFN-\u03b1, we analyzed it by western blot with an anti-human IFN\u03b1 antibody. For animals like camels which have limited species-specific immunological reagents, we have to rely on antibodies targeted against proteins of other well-studied organisms. The anti-human IFN-\u03b1 antibody recognized the recombinant camel protein, but the sensitivity seemed lower especially at low target concentration of the target protein (Fig. 5B). This may be due to the lesser amino acid identity between the human and camel IFN-\u03b1 proteins. For better sensitivity, anti-camel IFN\u03b1 specific antibodies need to be generated, keeping in mind of the role of camel as a potential reservoir of zoonotic diseases like MERS.",

Hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) have been identified so far and they form the major interferon-induced effectors contributing to antiviral activity. These IFN effector genes work in combination to induce a potent antiviral state (Schoggins and Rice, 2011). Mx1 effectively blocks viral replication, whereas viperin inhibits the early stages of viral entry and replication. ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like protein that has been reported to inhibit viral release and also modify viral as well as host proteins to elicit an antiviral response.

Preliminary evaluation of antiviral activity was conducted by visual observation of the reduction in cytopathic effects of CMLV in IFN-\u03b11 treated cells (Fig. 7A). The antiviral effect of IFN-\u03b1 pretreatment in vitro could be confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR estimation by showing reduction of the CMLV viral load and also by measuring the cell survivability (Fig. 7\nB and D).

Prokaryotically expressed recombinant IFN-\u03b11 protein induced the expression of ISGs and showed antiviral activity against camelpox virus in-vitro. To our knowledge, these proteins represent the first antiviral recombinant type-I camelid interferons and could be used in better understanding of the immune system of dromedary camels which has been reported to be a reservoir of zoonotic viruses like MERS coronavirus.",
