            "text": "For many emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, definitive solutions via sterilizing adaptive immunity may require years or decades to develop, if they are even possible. The innate immune system offers alternative mechanisms that do not require antigen-specific recognition or a priori knowledge of the causative agent. However, it is unclear whether effective stable innate immune system activation can be achieved without triggering harmful autoimmunity or other chronic inflammatory sequelae. Here, we show that transgenic expression of a picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), in the absence of other viral proteins, can profoundly reconfigure mammalian innate antiviral immunity by exposing the normally membrane-sequestered RdRP activity to sustained innate immune detection. RdRP-transgenic mice have life-long, quantitatively dramatic upregulation of 80 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and show profound resistance to normally lethal viral challenge. Multiple crosses with defined knockout mice (Rag1, Mda5, Mavs, Ifnar1, Ifngr1, and Tlr3) established that the mechanism operates via MDA5 and MAVS and is fully independent of the adaptive immune system. Human cell models recapitulated the key features with striking fidelity, with the RdRP inducing an analogous ISG network and a strict block to HIV-1 infection. This RdRP-mediated antiviral mechanism does not depend on secondary structure within the RdRP mRNA but operates at the protein level and requires RdRP catalysis. Importantly, despite lifelong massive ISG elevations, RdRP mice are entirely healthy, with normal longevity. Our data reveal that a powerfully augmented MDA5-mediated activation state can be a well-tolerated mammalian innate immune system configuration. These results provide a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiviral protection.",

In RdRP-transgenic mouse tissues, the mRNAs for critical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are highly elevated, up to 300-fold. Many antiviral ISGs are similarly induced, up to 560-fold, when we express the RdRP in human monocyte and lung epithelial cell lines. The elevated basal ISG profile protects RdRP mice and human cells from viral infection. RdRP mice are robustly healthy with normal longevity despite life-long, constitutive MDA5-mediated innate immune system activation. This work suggests a plausible approach to augmenting innate immunity to block viral pathogenesis.",

Positive-strand RNA viruses sequester the entire replication machinery to ultrastructurally-distinctive membrane-bound cytoplasmic compartments (termed replication factories) that they generate by massively re-engineering host organelle membranes [3] . For example, dengue virus replication occurs inside elaborately convoluted vesicles that contain viral dsRNA. High-resolution electron microscope tomography shows a continuous endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranous network with small pores through which plus-strand progeny genomes are released to the cytoplasm [4] . The RdRP of poliovirus, a picornavirus, is similarly associated with complex virus-engineered membranous structures although the precise morphology and topology, with respect to the cellular milieu, are unclear. Immuno-electron microscopic labeling has suggested that the poliovirus replication complex localizes to the cytoplasmic face of compact membrane vesicles that are, in turn, surrounded by larger elongated (rosette-like) vesicular structures [5, 6, 7] .",

In cultured vertebrate cell lines, parainfluenza virus RdRP [15] or Semliki Forest virus RdRP [16] expression induce IFN\u03b2, albeit by different mechanisms. We reported that mice made transgenic for a picornaviral RdRP-the 3D pol protein of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-resist infection by RNA and DNA viruses [17] . Here we determined the mechanism for this profound effect. In the mouse and in human cell lines, we show that ectopic expression of a catalytically-active RdRP produces dsRNA, a potent MDA5 agonist, which leads to constitutive ISG signaling and renders RdRP-expressing cells refractory to viral infection.",

Whole-genome mRNA microarray analyses of spinal cords from uninfected WT mice and EMCV-infected WT mice revealed that 37 genes (fold change criterion > 4.0 and P < 0.05) were upregulated significantly, up to 26.5-fold, in EMCV-infected mice compared to uninfected WT controls (Fig 1A WT+EMCV, S1A Fig, S1 Table) . In striking contrast, in spinal cords of uninfected RdRP mice, 80 gene mRNAs were elevated significantly. In addition, this baseline upregulation was quantitatively dramatic, up to 114-fold compared to uninfected WT controls (Fig 1A RdRP, S1A Fig, S2 Table) , and of the 80 elevated genes, 30 (38%) were elevated more than 10-fold. Importantly, of the 37 genes upregulated following lethal viral infection in WT mice, 97% were intrinsically upregulated > 4-fold in uninfected RdRP mice. In spinal cords from EMCV-infected RdRP mice, 79 genes were significantly upregulated, up to 124-fold, compared with uninfected WT controls (Fig 1A RdRP+EMCV, S1A Fig,  S3 Table) . Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference between the gene patterns of uninfected RdRP and virus-infected RdRP mice. These results demonstrate that RdRP mice possess, at baseline, a maximally upregulated innate immune transcriptome which is capable of effecting a robust antiviral response. In both breadth and extent, it far exceeds the innate immune gene inductions produced by virus infection itself (80 vs. 37 genes, mean fold induction 13.9-fold in uninfected RdRP vs. 8.5-fold in EMCV-infected WT).",

Viral molecular and structural motifs are detected by the cell-intrinsic innate immune system using pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). TLR3 is a PRR localized to the endosomal compartments, and RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 are RIG-I-like receptor RNA helicases with essential roles in cytosolic viral sensing [21, 22] . Recognition of viral motifs activates receptor-proximal signaling molecules, namely TRIF in the TLR3 pathway and MAVS in the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway, which converge on phosphorylation of members of the IFN regulatory factor family and production of type I IFNs. IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2 engagement with the cognate receptor (IFN\u03b1\u03b2R) on the plasma membrane recruits transcription factors which bind to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) to upregulate ISGs [2] . IFN-stimulated effectors can also be activated through the IFN\u03b3R and transcription factor binding to IFN\u03b3-activated site (GAS) promoter elements. Normally, these responses are highly constrained temporally, with acute sensor activation and ISG upregulation after the onset of viral infection, followed by resolution to baseline as infection is controlled by innate and adaptive immune responses.",

            "text": "In contrast, despite very high, constitutive ISG upregulation via activation of MDA5, RdRP mice have no evidence of autoimmunity or other systemic inflammatory conditions. Detailed analyses showed normal gross tissue morphology ( Fig 4B) and histology ( Fig 4A) with no detectable aberrant immune cell infiltration or inflammation. Kidneys had no glomerulonephritis ( Fig 4C) as was found in MDA5 G821S mice [19] . In fact, RdRP mice are healthy and indistinguishable from WT controls throughout their development ( Fig 4D) in all identifiable variables including habitus, weight gain, activity level, fertility, mating, and longevity (Fig 4E-4G ). Effects of background strain are possible and could be empirically tested (e.g., MDA5 G821S in DBA/2J vs. RdRP-Mda5 -/in C57BL/6J/FVB mice here). Nevertheless, these results redefine the range of chronic innate immune system activation states that can be well-tolerated in mammals. That is, a highly augmented antiviral state based on constitutive MDA5-mediated ISG activation can persist without inflammatory disease or other deleterious sequelae. In cultured vertebrate cells, RdRP expression can induce antiviral cytokine production, but mechanisms operating at the RNA and protein levels have been proposed. For example, transfection of plasmids encoding a 430 nucleotide segment of the parainfluenza virus RdRP transcript activated MDA5-mediated IFN\u03b2 production, implicating a structural motif within the RNA transcript itself [15] . In contrast, expression of the Semliki Forest virus RdRP protein in transfected cells induced IFN\u03b2 via dsRNA generation by templating on host RNA [16] .",

Termed replication factories, these enclosures house viral proteases, viral genomes, replication intermediates, and RdRPs [3, 28] . For picornaviruses, replication factory assembly is a complex, ordered process requiring viral translation, intracellular membrane rearrangement, vesicle budding and viral RNA synthesis.

The effect requires the MDA5-MAVS pathway, implying that dsRNA produced by the RdRP is the effective trigger. Indeed, we show the presence of endogenous dsRNA in neural tissue of uninfected RdRP mice (S4 Fig), and we hypothesize that this is due to nonspecific replicase activity similar to previously published reports of dsRNA generation following ectopic expression of viral RdRPs in vitro. For example, Nikonov and colleagues have shown that transient expression of the intact Semliki Forest virus RdRP protein activates IFN\u03b2 production in mammalian cell lines [16] . The authors determined that nonspecific replicase activity produced RNA PAMPs with the following characteristics: >200 nucleotides in length, non-polyadenylated, double-stranded, and containing a 5'-phosphate. The authors identified a putative RdRP-specific RNA clone, albeit within a mixture of PAMPs, that was complimentary to mouse antisense non-coding mitochondrial RNA 1, and they concluded that the Semliki Forest virus RdRP can induce IFN\u03b2 via dsRNA generation by templating on host RNA. Importantly, in this case sensing of dsRNA products was mediated through both RIG-I and MDA5 since knockdown of either sensor alone was not sufficient to completely abolish innate immune activation [16] . Similar to these results, we show that when the TMEV RdRP is expressed transgenically (in the complete absence of other viral proteins), the presence of endogenous dsRNA accompanies PRR-mediated innate immune activation. In contrast, however, our data demonstrate that knockout of MDA5 completely blocks TMEV RdRP-induced ISG activation (S2D Fig) which results in compromised murine survival following viral infection (Fig 3D) . Therefore, we hypothesize the nonspecific TMEV replicase activity produces dsRNA by templating on host RNA, which in turn activates MDA5-MAVS-mediated ISG activation. However, a role for RIG-I in this system cannot be ruled out at present.",

Thus, we propose that a powerfully augmented MDA5-mediated activation state can be a well-tolerated mammalian innate immune system configuration. This is a novel result, further investigation of which may provide clues to the pathogenesis of nucleic acid-based autoimmunity. The quintessential outcome of aberrant MDA5 activation has heretofore been documented in genetic association studies of autoimmune disorders and type I interferonopathies. Human SNPs in both MAVS [29] and MDA5 [30] carry increased risk of developing SLE. In a genome-wide association study, MDA5 was also identified as a susceptibility locus for autoimmune type 1 diabetes [31] . More recently, rare missense gain-of-function MDA5 mutations were shown to cause AGS, an inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the skin and nervous system. Affected individuals presented with a range of disease phenotypes in which elevated ISG expression due to enhanced interferon state was central to pathogenesis [18] . Similar clinical manifestations have also been reported in mice harboring a single missense mutation (G821S) in MDA5 resulting in an autoactivated form [19] .",

Such approaches must be tailored to each virus or to a limited group of closely related viruses and cannot broadly prevent infection or diseases caused by viruses from diverse families. The innate immune system is not antigen-specific but functions instead to sense a variety of viral motifs. Activation of the cellintrinsic viral sensing pathway empowers broadly antiviral capabilities via ISG activation [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40] . Consistent with these data, we have shown that augmenting host innate immune responses can stably (Fig 1D) , safely (Fig 4) , rapidly (Fig 6C) , and broadly (EMCV, HIV-1, TMEV, vesicular stomatitis virus, pseudorabies virus) [17, 20] protect against viral disease. Therapeutic stimulation of innate immune pathways in this way may adequately limit the replication and spread of novel virulent pathogens.

Mice used for RT-PCR and immunoblotting were directly compared with sibling controls (Fig 3 and S2 Fig) . To obtain enough mice per genotype for survival curves (Fig  3) , second generation homozygotes were intercrossed and bred to double homozygosity. Thus, in all sublines our data directly compare knockout RdRP -/mice derived from the same cross that generated the knockout RdRP +/+ mice. In genetic crosses, the RdRP transgene was inherited in ratios consistent with Mendelian inheritance. Age-matched adult mice (> 8 weeks) were used for experiments.",
