            "text": "Griffithsin is one of a number of lectins that have been shown to exhibit significant activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as against several other enveloped viruses.\n1 Griffithsin was originally isolated from the red alga Griffithsia sp., collected from the waters off New Zealand, as part of a program at the National Cancer Institute to screen natural product extracts for their ability to inhibit the cytopathic effects of HIV.2 This lectin was shown to inhibit the cytopathic effects of different isolates of HIV\u20101 at concentrations as low as 43 pM,2 as well as exhibited activity against viruses such as the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).3 Crystal structures of two different recombinant forms of griffithsin,3 cloned with and without additional residues on the N terminus of the protein,4 have shown it to be a domain\u2010swapped dimer belonging to the \u03b2\u2010prism\u2010I (jacalin\u2010related) family,5 with each molecule exhibiting almost perfect internal three\u2010fold symmetry. Crystal structures of the complexes of griffithsin with monosaccharides such as mannose and N\u2010acetyl glucosamine, obtained by cocrystallization and/or soaking, have shown that each molecule contains three binding sites that form an almost perfect equilateral triangle, with each side \u223c15 \u00c5 long. We have postulated that multivalency of binding might be the reason for the potency of this lectin,3 yet attempts to obtain experimental structures of complexes in the presence of oligosaccharides, such as Man9GlcNAc2, that are commonly found on viral envelope glycoproteins such as HIV1 gp120,6 Ebola virus gp17 and the SARS coronavirus spike proteins8 have so far been unsuccessful. The unique structure of griffithsin, which includes six independent sugar binding sites, provides opportunities to bind multiple individual sugars on large oligosaccharides such as Man9GlcNAc2, while viral envelope glycoproteins such as gp120 present an estimated 11 high mannose oligosaccharides to which griffithsin can bind.8 The importance of multivalency for antiviral lectin potency has previously been elaborated for the anti\u2010HIV protein cyanovirin\u2010N.9 The combination of multiple targets on one oligosaccharide together with an antiviral protein containing several lectin domains results in multivalent interactions, which are likely responsible for the unusual potency of griffithsin and also the difficulty in obtaining structural data on these large complexes. Thus a combination of crystallography, modeling, and biophysical measurements was found to be necessary in order to explain the antiviral properties of this potential future pharmaceutical agent.",

Oligomannose structures (ManxGlcNAc2, x = 5\u20139) were generated using the database of glycosidic linkage conformations\n15 and the results of conformational studies on Man9GlcNAc2 using NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics.16 A single domain of griffithsin was created from the coordinates of the 1.78 \u00c5 structure of the complex with mannose (PDB code 2guc)3 and included residues A1\u2010A18 and B19\u2010B121. The crystal structure of snowdrop agglutinin17 was obtained from the PDB database18 (accession code 1msa). Oligomannose glycans were docked to single domains or molecules of griffithsin and agglutinin, respectively, by overlaying the required terminal mannose residues of ManxGlcNAc2 on the experimentally determined mannose residues in the appropriate binding sites, and using simulated annealing to minimize the oligosaccharide structure while keeping the terminal oligosaccharide residues in the binding sites and the protein tertiary structure fixed. In all cases, minimal changes were needed to the protein side chains in order to accommodate the glycans. For bidentate binding of Man9GlcNAc2 to agglutinin, the side chain conformation of Lys38 had to be adjusted to remove steric clashes, and for tridentate binding of Man9GlcNAc2 to griffithsin, the side chain conformation of Tyr28 had to be adjusted very slightly in both the A and B molecules. The distances between the binding sites were taken as the distance between the C1 atoms of the monosaccharides in the binding sites. Similarly, the distance between an oligosaccharide residue and a binding site was taken as the distance between the C1 atom of the glycan residue and the C1 atom of the residue in the binding site. Oligomannose residues are numbered according to the standard nomenclature.19 The torsion angle nomenclature used for a 1\u2010x linkage is \u03d5 = O5\u2014C1\u2014O\u2014Cx\u2032, \u03c8 = C1\u2014O\u2014Cx\u2032\u2014Cx\u22121\u2032 and \u03c9 = O\u2014C6\u2032\u2014C5\u2032\u2014C4\u2032.",

Such a large positive change in the entropy could only be due to that of the water molecules being excluded from the binding interface, and this then providing the driving force for association, outweighing any loss of translational and configurational entropy of the ligand or the side chains of the protein at the binding site. The higher affinity of griffithsin for 1\u21926\u03b1\u2010mannobiose compared to mannose can then be rationalized by the larger glycan displacing more water from the binding site. The weaker binding of maltose compared to mannose or 1\u21926\u03b1\u2010mannobiose suggested that either less water was excluded or that conformational entropy of the ligand was lost upon binding (the latter being consistent with the much greater degree of order seen for the bound maltose glycan compared to 1\u21926\u03b1\u2010mannobiose, Fig. \n2). The negative enthalpies of binding indicated that favorable protein\u2010ligand interactions (polar, van der Waals, and hydrogen bonds) compensated for any loss of solvation. The similarities in values of \u0394H for the glycans were consistent with the glycans making similar numbers of contacts to the protein (an extra hydrogen bond, for example, would be worth an additional 2 kcal/mol).",

The separation of the three adjacent mannose binding sites on griffithsin was relatively small, each approximately 15 \u00c5 apart from the others. Man9GlcNAc2 (Fig. \n4A) was modeled to interact in a tridentate fashion to these three binding sites, in all three possible configurations (i.e. independent of which terminal mannose residue was bound to which binding site). In the model discussed here, Man11 corresponds to the terminal mannose of the D1 arm, Man8 to the terminal mannose of the D2 arm, and Man6 to the terminal mannose of the D3 arm of Man9GlcNAc2 (Fig. 4B). The resulting structure had all of the glycosidic linkages within their observed experimental ranges (Table IV), corresponding to one of the minimum energy conformations of the oligosaccharide.\n16 None of the smaller oligomannose glycans appeared to be able to bind to griffithsin in a tridentate fashion. Each of the three Man8GlcNAc2 isomers (missing the terminal mannose on either of the D1, D2, or D3 arms) could form a bidentate complex using the two remaining terminal mannose residues, as could the three Man7GlcNAc2 isomers missing either residues D2 and A, residues D3 and B or residues D1 and C Man9GlcNAc2. The most common Man5GlcNAc2 isomer (missing terminal mannose residues on the D1, D2, D3 arms as well as the removal of a second mannose residue from the D1 arm) could only form a mondentate complex with griffithsin, binding of residue B giving a minimum distance of 6 \u00c5 between residue C and the nearest binding site. Thus, Man9GlcNAc2 could bind to griffithsin with high affinity by interacting with up to three binding sites whereas Man5GlcNAc2 could only bind in a mondentate fashion.",

It was not possible to model tridentate binding of Man9GlcNAc2 to snowdrop agglutinin (i.e. with all three terminal mannose residues binding to the protein) because of the relatively large separation of the mannose binding sites on the protein (binding sites are separated by 20 \u00c5 or more). It was possible to dock Man9GlcNAc2 to snowdrop agglutinin with two of the terminal mannose residues (on the D1 and D3 arms) binding to the protein (either sites A112 and B112, or sites C112 and D112 labeled as in the PDB file). However, this required significant distortions to the usual torsion angles for at least two of the glycosidic linkages in the oligosaccharide (Table IV). For instance, the Man\u03b11\u21922Man linkage of the D3 residue had to be in a conformation with \u03d5, \u03c8 values in the region of \u221290\u00b0, \u221280\u00b0. This linkage is normally only observed with \u03d5, \u03c8 values in the region +70\u00b0, \u2212105\u00b0.15 It was not possible to model bidentate binding of any smaller oligomannose oligosaccharides to snowdrop agglutinin. It therefore seemed plausible that snowdrop agglutinin normally only binds in a monodentate fashion to oligomannose glycans, achieving its relatively high affinity20 through binding to multiply presented oligosaccharides.",

The only stereochemical difference between the glucose and mannose residues of maltose and 1\u21926\u03b1\u2010mannobiose was in the conformation at the C2 carbon of the sugar ring. Oxygen O2 pointed in the opposite direction in the structures of the two complexes, but in neither of them was it found to be involved in hydrogen bonds other than to solvent molecules. Therefore, it would appear that the principal binding site of griffithsin should not be specific for either mannose or glucose. However, in examining the calorimetric titration data, we observed clear distinction between the bindings of maltose and that of 1\u21926\u03b1\u2010mannobiose (or mannose). The mannose\u2010containing sugars bound griffithsin with more that fourfold greater affinity than did maltose. In addition, precipitation was observed only after addition of 1\u21922\u03b1\u2010mannobiose and 1\u21923\u03b1\u2010mannobiose to the protein solution but not 1\u21926\u03b1\u2010mannobiose. If this precipitation is due to crosslinking then the lack of precipitation with the 1\u21926\u03b1\u2010mannobiose could be explained by limited accessibility of the second mannose to additional griffithsin molecules. Additional studies are planned to further clarify this result.",

            "text": "Crystal structures and modeling results clearly indicated that in order to bind larger carbohydrates with high affinity, griffithsin utilizes multiple, monosaccharide\u2010specific binding sites in a multivalent binding mode. In this respect this algal lectin is very different from other antiviral proteins of cyanobacterial origin, such as cyanovirin,\n21 scytovirin,22 or MVL,23 which achieved high affinity through an extended binding site. The latter lectins specifically recognized larger oligosaccharide structures on the terminal branch (cyanovirin), D3 arm (scytovirin), or four\u2010five units of the oligomannoside core (MVL). Griffithsin is also significantly different from other multivalent lectins such as mannose\u2010binding protein (MBP). MBP consists of trimeric units of carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), each CRD monomer of the trimer having one low\u2010affinity mannose binding site (K\nd \u223c 3 mM). Each CRD trimer is attached to a long collagen\u2010like domain and these oligomerize to form tetramers to hexamers of trimers, each MBP oligomer having twelve to fifteen mannose binding sites. However, the arrangement of these binding sites is such that a single oligomannose molecule cannot interact with more than one CRD. Thus, high affinity is only achieved by multiple binding to multiply presented oligomannose molecules on a cell surface,24 as discussed above for agglutinin. Conversely, such high affinity for individual oligomannose glycans is likely to be responsible for the potent antiviral activity displayed by griffithsin against enveloped viruses such as HIV and the SARS coronavirus.",

That structure, refined at 3.0 \u00c5 resolution,\n25 included two complete molecules (A and B) of Man9GlcNAc2. Each of them made extensive contacts with the protein and carbohydrate molecules related by crystallographic symmetry and they exhibited some significant differences, although their overall structures were generally similar (Fig. 4C). The largest differences, including a significant departure from ideal geometry, were present in the link between the D3 and B mannoses. The distances between the terminal sugars, defined as distances between their C1 atoms, were 13.2, 14.1, and 17.9 \u00c5 for molecule A, and 11.2, 13.2, and 13.7 \u00c5 for molecule B. The extreme distances (11.2 and 17.9 \u00c5) both involved the D3 mannoses. By comparison, the distances measured in the model of the Man9GlcNAc2\u2010griffithsin complex, which were strictly based on the experimentally determined positions of the mannose residues observed in the monosaccharide complexes of griffithsin, were 13.7, 14.7, and 15.2 \u00c5. Although all modeling results must be interpreted with care, we are confident that the proposed mode of interactions is at least feasible and it explains the known properties of griffithsin. The multiple binding sites of this lectin also explain why this protein was usually precipitated upon addition of multivalent carbohydrates. It must be stressed, however, that this property should not necessarily interfere with the antiviral activity of griffithsin, because obstruction of the carbohydrates on the viral envelope by crosslinking might be as efficient in preventing fusion as the proper, multivalent interactions with a single molecule. This does, however, explain our inability to obtain crystals of the complexes of griffithsin with carbohydrates that contain more than two sugar units. Interestingly, the terminal D1 mannose in the 2G12 complex contacts a different antibody molecule than the terminal mannoses on the D2 and D3 arms, proving that, even in that case, Man9GlcNAc2 is involved in making intermolecular interactions with molecules related by crystallographic symmetry.",
