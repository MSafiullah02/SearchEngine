A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Nepalese adults from March 29 to April 07, 2020. A 13-and 15-items structured questionnaire assessed the COVID-19 related knowledge and perception of the universal safety measure. Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test evaluated the differences in knowledge between the groups. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 21.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). Of the 884 surveys accessed, a total of 871 consented (electronically) and completed the online survey (response rate 98.52%). The median knowledge score of the participants was 10.0 (\u00b1 3.0 IQR). Although participants' overall knowledge score was high, only about half of the participants knew about the concept of quarantine and the ideal distance to be maintained between individuals to prevent the transmission. Though the majority of the participants had positive perception towards universal safety measure of COVID-19, about 18% perceived that coronavirus infected only older people, 11% opined that the infection was highly fatal with no chances of survival and 70% considered that limiting consumptions of poultry and meat would prevent the spread of COVID-19. A statistically significant difference in knowledge was noted by participants' age, educational status, occupational type, and household monthly income. This study found optimal knowledge and perception of universal safety measures of COVID-19 among the Nepalese population, but misinformation and misunderstanding prevailed.",

On one hand, COVID-19 is highly transmissible, while on the other hand, currently, no vaccine or antiviral drugs have been approved for it. In this context, the application of preventive measures such as hygiene practices, social distancing measures, self-quarantines, lockdown, and closure of the non-essential business is the most crucial intervention [7] , which have been applied in many countries to prevent the catastrophic impact of the outbreak.",

Although COVID-19 cases and mortality soared in many countries, no further cases were reported in Nepal until the second week of March 2020. As of April 12, 2020, 13 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Nepal (including the case reported in January, which has already recovered) [9] . Of these, 11 cases were travel-related or imported, and only one was community transmitted. Considering the imminent threat of COVID-19 spread in Nepal, the government of Nepal has initiated several preventive measures. These include designation of medical hubs across the country and a \"Dedicated Isolation Hospital\" in the capital city of Kathmandu to treat the COVID-19 cases. All international flights were suspended, and a health-desk is established at the Tribhuvan International Airport [10] ; checkpoints were established in the border with India. Further, a country-wide lockdown came into effect from March 24, 2020, where people were asked to stay at home except for emergency reasons. Given that the outbreak has been deemed unmanageable even in countries with developed health infrastructures like the US and Italy, global health experts have pointed out that the situation may be dire in less developed economies like Nepal, which already has health resource constrains. Hence controlling the viral spread at the initial stage of the outbreak is paramount in Nepal, and the general public is an important collaborator in this effort.",

Misinformation, misunderstanding, and lack of awareness among people can lead to non-compliance to basic sanitation and disobedience of national guidelines, which may facilitate the rapid transmission of infection in the community. Therefore, for the effective implementation of preventive measures, it is important to examine the level of knowledge and perception of the universal safety precaution among the Nepalese population during this global health crisis.

Call for participation, and subsequently, the survey link was made available publicly on the web page of the Asian College for Advance Studies affiliated to Purbanchal University. To maximize public outreach, the survey was promoted in different social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. The survey took approximately 10 min to complete.

Most (92.5%) of the participants knew about the three major symptoms of COVID-19 (i.e., fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath). Likewise, the majority also had correct knowledge on the incubation period (i.e., 2-14 days) and unavailability of COVID-19 treatment. Although the majority of the participants had correct knowledge, nevertheless, The median score of COVID-19 knowledge of participants was 10.0 (\u00b1 3.0 IQR). A statistically significant difference in COVID-19 knowledge scores was noted by participants' age, education level, occupation, and monthly household income (Supplementary Table 1 ). Table 3 presents participants' perceptions regarding the universal safety precaution of COVID-19. The majority of the participants (> 95%) agreed that maintaining good personal hygiene, washing hands frequently, staying home, following social distancing, and avoiding crowds would prevent the spread of COVID-19. Further, they also agreed that coronavirus spreads from humans to humans, mainly through respiratory droplets, and avoiding handshaking and touching eyes, nose, and mouth would prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, misperception was prevalent in certain areas such as more than half of the participants perceived (either agreed or weren't sure) that the virus could also transmit by fecal-oral route and consumptions of meat and poultry could increase the spread. Although a lesser, yet still a sizable, proportion (10-20%) of participants perceived that COVID-19 attacked only older people, and there was no survival following the infection. About 18% disagreed or weren't sure that coughing into elbow was a good practice to prevent the spread.",

In line with our findings, a study from China reported that 90% of the residents of the province had good knowledge about COVID-19 [16] . An online survey conducted in the USA and UK also reported that participants had good knowledge of the mode of disease transmission and symptoms [17] . Some of the characteristics of our participants, which are also our study's limitations, explains the observed high knowledge. First, this is a web-based survey, but notably only 51.15% of Nepalese use internet [18] , which is mostly concentrated in urban Nepal [18] . Education status is a strong predictor of knowledge and perception [19] . The literacy rate in Nepal is only 66% [20] which is further lower in rural areas. All of the participants in our study had some level of formal education, and about 34% had a health background, either as a health professional or as a student. Together, all these characteristics of study participants suggest that they are more likely to be informed and have positive perceptions. On the flip side, it suggests that the COVID-19 knowledge and perceptions may be poor among the general population, especially those uneducated and without access to the internet, which should draw the attention of relevant stakeholders for disseminating information. Noninternet users and those without education are also the target population for future research on this topic. The importance of preventive measures in controlling outbreaks cannot be debated. A cross-sectional study conducted in the USA and UK suggested that awareness should be provided to the people focusing on the most effective preventive measures [17] . It is always essential to communicate the risk and preventive measures of the diseases to the public during the outbreak of a virus or microorganisms or hazards [21] . Given that a majority of our participants had heard about COVID-19 through social media, use of different social media may be an important and easily implementable platform, at least for certain segments of the population, to disseminate public health information and demystify the COVID-19 outbreak.",
