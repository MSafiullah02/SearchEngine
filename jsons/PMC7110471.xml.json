Antimicrobial agents including tetracycline, tilmicosin, florfenicol, tulathromycin, ceftiofur and enrofloxacin are used routinely to prevent and/or treat BRD (Welsh et al., 2004). A reliance on these drugs creates a selection pressure that may result in the emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms (Barton et al., 2003). Resistance is emerging amongst BRD pathogens, particularly to those antimicrobial agents from first generation classes (e.g. tetracycline) (Welsh et al, 2004, Portis et al, 2012). Moreover, antimicrobial resistance patterns vary according to bacterial species and geographical location (Hendriksen et al., 2008), meaning that local knowledge of susceptibilities is critical for the effective prevention and treatment of H. somni infections.",

One year prior to registration of tulathromycin in Northern America in 2004, 2\u20136% of BRD pathogens exhibited resistance and, by 2009, only 81% of H. somni remained susceptible (Portis et al., 2012).
