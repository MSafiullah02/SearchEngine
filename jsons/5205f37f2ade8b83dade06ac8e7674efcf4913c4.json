            "text": "The proprotein convertases (PCs) are serine proteases that bellow to the kexin subfamily of subtilases enzymes responsible for the processing and the activation of multiple polypeptide precursors. These secretory precursors are usually cleaved at the general motif (K/R)-(X)n-(K/R)#, where X is any amino acid (except C), n \u00bc 0, 2, 4, or 6, and # represents the cleavage site where the peptide is hydrolyzed. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] To date, seven basic amino acids (AA)-specific PCs, serine proteases belonging to the kexin subfamily of subtilases, were reported to be involved in these processes. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] These include Furin, PC1 (also called PC3), PC2, PC4, PACE4, PC5 (also called PC6), and PC7 (also called PC8, LPC, or SPC7). [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Recently, other two nonbasic-AA-specific convertases, SKI-1 7, 8 and NARC-1 9 were identified. These convertases belong to the Pyrolysin and Proteinase K subfamily of subtilases, respectively. While, SKI-1 was found to exhibit a cleavage specificity for the motif (R/K)-X-(hydrophobic)-(L,T)#, based on its autocatalytic site, NARC-1 seems to prefer the V-F-A-Q# motif. 10 In this review, the role of the proprotein convertases in the mediation of some diseases will be briefly summarized, the mode of action of their natural and exogenous inhibitors will be described and their potential use as new targets for the treatment of various diseases will be discussed.",

            "text": "The involvement of proprotein convertases in tumorigenesis has been extensively reviewed. 2, 13, 14 Some of the cleaved protein precursors by the PCs, such as matrix metalloproteases, adhesion molecules, growth factors, and growth factor receptors are directly or indirectly involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis by regulating either degradation of extra-cellular matrix and/or modulation of cell growth and survival. 2, 13, 14 Using different tumor cells with invasive/metastatic phenotypes, the inhibition of PC-activity was found to provoke dramatic changes in several phenotypes that impact on the metastatic potential of tumor cells. 2, 13, 14 Similarly, using various sitedirected mutagenesis, we found that the inhibition of the processing of several PC substrates such as PDGF-A, 15 and VEGF-C 16 reduced significantly their ability to induce tumor development and angiogenesis, respectively. 15, 16 This data highlighted the importance of PCs in the activation of these growth factors during tumor progression and angiogenesis. 15, 16 C. Bacterial Toxins Activation by the PCs Three different classes of bacterial toxins were described to be activated by the PCs. The toxins of the first class are synthesized as single polypeptide chains that group the toxic subunit and the target binding subunit. The toxin precursors are cleaved during their interaction with the target cell surface or in the endosomal compartment by the PCs. [17] [18] [19] [20] Of the toxins that belong to this class and were reported to be activated by the PCs are the Diptheria toxin, 19 Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PEA), 17, 18 Botulinum neurotoxin, and Bordetella dermonecrotic toxin. 20 The second class of toxins such as Anthrax are synthesized as separate polypeptide chains and usually assemble on the target cell surface to form the active toxin following activation of the binding subunit by the PCs. 21, 22 The third class groups the pore-forming toxins such as the aerolysin. These toxins are produced and secreted as a dimer that bind on target cells to the glycosylphosphatidyl inositol anchors of membrane proteins. Usually the cleavage of these toxins by the PCs occurred on the surface of the target cell during their binding. This process seems to be crucial for the association of the toxin dimers into heptamer pore complex and causes cell lysis. 23 ",

These include the HIV-1 gp160 24, 25 and surface glycoproteins of Hong Kong, Ebola virus, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 26, 27 In parallel, other studies revealed that the inhibition of processing of these viral surface glycoproteins by the PC inhibitors such as dec-R-V-K-R-CMK completely abrogated the virus-induced cellular cytopathicity. Recently, the surface glycoproteins of other viruses, particularly the hemorrhagic fever viruses (Arenaviridae family) such as Lassa, 28, 29 Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, 30 and lymphocytic choriomeningitis 31 were shown to be cleaved by the convertase SKI-1. Similarly, blockade of SKI-1 activity by specific inhibitor were also shown to affect the processing and the stability of the glycoproteins of these viruses. 32 ",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 36 Following their signal sequence removal and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) folding events, PCs undergo auto-proteolytic cleavage of their prosegment at R107 (Fig. 1 ). The prosegment, however, remains associated with the mature domain of the enzyme and functions as a potent auto-inhibitor during transport to the late secretory pathway. After this step, the inactive complex transits to the late trans-Golgi network (TGN) where the relatively acidic pH permits a second autoproteolytic cleavage of the prosegment at R75 and activates the convertase (Fig. 1 ). 6, 35 Using these inhibitors, we were able to inhibit the processing and the function of various PC substrates such as PDGF-A, 15 PDGF-B, 37 VEGF-C, 16 and IGF-1 receptor 2 (Fig. 2) . Recently, the Furin inhibition by its pro-segment proFurin was reported as feasible approach to reduce and/or abolish the malignant phenotype of various malignancies. 38 Indeed, the expression of the complete proFurin cDNA sequence in various human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines was found to reduce dramatically their proliferation, tumorigenicity, and invasiveness in vitro and in vivo as well. 38 These proFurin effects were directly linked to the inhibition of Furin-mediated activation of various crucial cancer-related substrates, such as TGF-b, VEGF-C, IGF-1 receptor, and MT1-MMP. 38 ",

Nevertheless, Braks and Martens were the firsts to show that 7B2 act as a chaperone for proPC2 and be able to bound to the latter in the early compartment of the secretory pathway and dissociates from it in the latter ones. 39 Other studies proposed that 7B2 may also facilitates proPC2 transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the secretory granules and participates in the generation of fully active PC2. 40 Following their secretion, pro7B2 and proPC2 interact in the ER in the presence of an alkaline pH and form an inactive complex (pro7B2-proPC2). During its progression through the TGN in the presence of decreased pH and increased [Ca 2\u00fe ] the pro7B2 is cleaved by the PCs and released a C-terminal fragment with inhibitory function on PC2. 41, 42 In the secretory granules, additional pH decreases and [Ca 2\u00fe ] increases permits proPC2 self activation and liberates the prodomain of PC2 that provides a fully active PC2 (Fig. 3) . Subsequently, the N-terminal domain of PC2 and C-terminal domain of 7B2 are rapidly degraded by PC2 and carboxypeptidase E (Fig. 3) . [40] [41] [42] 3. ProSAAS; the Naturally Occurring Inhibitor of PC1 Like 7B2, ProSAAS, contains an N-terminal and a C-terminal domain that are separated by a PC cleavage sites. The sequence responsible for the inhibitory potency of PC1 was previously pointed to the hexapeptide, L-L-R-V-K-R, located in the proSAAS C-terminal domain. 43 This peptide was identified by combinatorial library peptide screening as a tight binding site for PC1. 44, 45 Like PC2, PC1 is inactive in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus due to the neutral pH and relatively low Ca 2\u00fe levels in addition to its interaction with proSAAS. 46 Following its progression through the TGN, proSAAS is cleaved into two peptides designed as PEN and LEN fragments that remove the inhibition of PC1 by proSAAS (Fig. 4) .

Analysis of the bikunin structure revealed the presence of two protease domains of the Kunitz type carrying the antiproteolytic function of the IalphaIp. Bikunin was found to be effective against a broad range of enzymes that includes trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, and leukocyte elastase, as well as cathepsins B and H.

            "text": "Eglin C is a proteinase inhibitor that strongly inhibits human leukocyte elastase, cathepsin G, achymotrypsin, and substilisin. 66 This inhibitor was initially isolated from the leech Hirudo medicinalis and belongs to the potato I inhibitor family. 67 Previously, it was reported that its inhibitory specificity could be changed and inhibits trypsin by a point mutation at its reactive site L45R. Subsequently, substitution of residues at each position P1, P2, and P4 of eglin C with a basic residue made it a very strong inhibitor for Furin. 68 Recently, the generation of the three-dimensional complex structures of Furin-eglin C mutant interaction by a modeller program provided crucial information on the interaction between the Furin and this inhibitor. 69 The modellation of this interaction allowed the calculation of the electrostatic interaction energies between the Furin and eglin C mutant. 69 The results that were obtained from this study highlighted the importance of the charge-charge interactions in the binding of Furin to its inhibitors, suggesting the roles of the electrostatic interactions in the inhibitory activity of eglin C mutant toward Furin. 69 Further analysis revealed that the mutation of R48D (P3 0 residue) in eglin C seems to increase the inhibitory action of the eglin C mutant due to the electrostatic interactions of D48 with R86 and R90 of Furin (Fig. 7) . The discovery of this inhibitor was initially based on the observation previously reported for a patient with a mutation in its a1-antitrypsin. 70 This patient was shown to be unable to cleave the pro-albumin at the Furin consensus site. 71 This variant of a1-antitrypsin, called a1-anti-trypsin Pittsburgh (PIT), has a replacement of the reactive-site M358 residue by R358 residue. Subsequently, the group of G. Thomas developed another variant of a1-antitrypsin, called a1-anti-trypsin Portland (a1-PDX), in which the reactive-site A-I-P-M has been replaced by R-I-P-R. This serpin was revealed to inhibit Furin with a Ki of 600 pM, three times lower than the PIT inhibitor. 72 Subsequently, kinetic analysis showed that a portion of bound a1-PDX operates as a suicide inhibitor (Fig. 8) . Once bound to Furin's active site, a1-PDX can either undergo proteolysis by Furin or form a kinetically trapped SDS-stable complex with the enzyme. 73 Furthermore, when expressed in cells, a1-PDX was shown to be a potent inhibitor of Furin-mediated cleavage of HIV gp 160, 72 and subsequently demonstrated to inhibit all PCs involved in processing within the constitutive secretory pathway. In vitro experiments revealed also its ability to block the processing of various proteins related tumor progression and metastasis such as several growth factors (Fig. 2) , receptors, various MMPs and adhesion molecules.

Each monomeric subunit contains an internal S-ester (ISE). a2-macroglobulin inhibits a wide range of proteases by a unique mechanism. 75 Inhibition is initiated by cleavage of a flexible and surface-accessible peptide stretch called the bait region (Fig. 9 ). This cleavage triggers the hydrolysis of the ISEs, followed by a major conformational change. The protease becomes ''trapped'' by the inhibitor and is thus sterically shielded from its substrate. 75 By introducing a Furin recognition sequence in the bait region of a2-macroglobulin, Van Rompaey et al., have generated a potent PC inhibitor as revealed by its ability to inhibit the processing of von Willebrand factor, TGF-b1, and the HIV-1 glycoprotein gp160. 76 Lately, it was revealed that the mutation introduced in the bait region of a2-macroglobulin did not interfere neither with folding, neither on tetramerization of the inhibitor. Also the Furin inhibition mechanism by this a2-macroglobulin mutant was found to be similar to those used for the inhibition of other proteases by a2-macroglobulin 76 (Fig. 9 ).",

The actual mechanism by which these diterpines exert their inhibitory effects against PC is not clearly understood. Nevertheless, these molecules contain a very reactive fivemembered lactone ring that was found in several elastases inhibitors, suggesting the potential role of this lactone ring in the Furin activity inhibition. Although the in vitro inhibition is relatively weak, these compounds seem to penetrate more easily in the cell and might enhance their inhibitory potential in vivo.",

Thereby, the use of general PC inhibitors is now suggested to be advantageous and could be a promising therapeutic strategy. However, in some cases it may be necessary to target only one member of the PC family. This is feasible, as was demonstrated previously for pro-SAAS and 7B2. In addition the recently published crystal structures of the Furin will undoubtedly help for the search, design, and the development of specific and potent inhibitor for each PC. Indeed, the availability of the crystal structures of the Furin has recently revealed precious knowledge on the characteristics of the other PCs through modellation of their structures. 60 Based on these studies, the arrangement of the catalytic and P domains, and the architecture of the substrate binding clefts of the Furin seems to be more similar to those of PC4, PACE4, and PC5/6, and less similar to those of PC1/3, PC2, and PC7. 60 Following their development these specific inhibitor could be used alone or in combination to target PC-mediated diseases. Recent studies revealed that small molecule proprotein convertases inhibitors are the most attractive potential therapeutic agents. However, only the diterpene and several Cu and Zn chelators where reported as nonpeptide PC inhibitors. Although these inhibitors were able to inhibit the activity of the PCs in vitro, their ability to block the processing of various PC substrates in vivo is not yet tested. Similarly, to improve the specificity and the efficacy of such inhibitors, chemical modifications of their structures followed by structure-activity studies are required. In the long term, the potential developed specific and potent PC inhibitors may provide a rationale for testing this family of compounds as therapeutic agents or in conjunction with standard therapy in clinical settings.",
