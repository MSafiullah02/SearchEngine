KT992094) with the further modification of a 112 nucleotide phenotypically silent deletion in the SH noncoding sequence that stabilizes the complementary DNA (cDNA) during propagation in bacteria [26]. RSV/\u0394NS2/\u03941313/I1314L contains 2 independent attenuating elements: (1) a 523 nucleotide deletion of the NS2 gene and (2) a codon deletion in the L gene (\u03941313; deletion of S1313) plus the adjacent missense mutation I1314L that prevents the compensatory deattenuating mutation I1314T [25]. The virus was generated from cDNA on World Health Organization Vero cells by reverse genetics [18], and clinical trial material (CTM) was prepared at Charles River Laboratories. Sequence analysis confirmed that the seed virus and CTM were free of detectable adventitious mutations. The CTM had a mean infectivity titer of 107.3 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL. CTM was stored at \u221270\u00b0C and diluted to dose on site using Leibovitz L15 medium. L15 medium was used as placebo.",

Sequence analysis of shed vaccine virus confirmed the stability of these mutations. Previously, RSV vaccine candidates containing the NS2 deletion and other nonstabilized ts mutations were evaluated in phase 1 studies; these vaccines were either underattenuated or overattenuated [7]. However, 106 PFU of RSV/\u0394NS2/\u03941313/I1314L infected all RSV-seronegative children and induced a primary antibody response in 90%.",

Rhinorrhea occurred more often in seronegative vaccinees than in placebo recipients, although the differences were not statistically significant when the 105 PFU and 106 PFU dose cohorts were considered singly or together. Rates of illness did not increase with the higher dose. Other respiratory viruses were detected frequently in vaccinees and placebo recipients, consistent with previous studies [6, 30], but we also encountered a substantial number of respiratory events without concurrent detection of any pathogen. This high incidence of background respiratory illness, typical for this age group, and the inability to detect potential causative agents in some symptomatic children, indicate that larger studies will be needed to determine whether administration of RSV/\u0394NS2/\u03941313/I1314L is associated with an increased risk of mild respiratory illness. Should administration of RSV/\u0394NS2/\u03941313/I1314L be associated with transient rhinorrhea, this would probably be acceptable if efficacy against RSV-associated LRI was demonstrated.",

In the current study, we also conducted surveillance for the first time during a second RSV season in a subset of children to assess the durability of the immune response. As previously demonstrated for all live attenuated RSV vaccines evaluated to date, there was no evidence of enhanced RSV disease in any vaccine recipient. Of the children with presumed RSV-MAARI, 50% of vaccines and 33% of placebo recipients had \u22651 additional respiratory virus isolated, so attribution remains unclear. We note that the rates of RSV-MAARI in this study and in our previous studies [10\u201312] were low compared with some population-based epidemiologic studies, probably because we purposefully selected children without medical risk factors for serious RSV disease for enrollment in these phase 1 studies.",

The antibody responses in the vaccinees were memory responses, whereas those in the placebo recipients generally were primary responses.

Alternatively, the boost could consist of a PIV-vectored bivalent RSV/PIV vaccine [31]; in animal studies, the replication and immunogenicity of PIV-vectored RSV vaccines was unaffected by RSV-specific immunity from a prior immunization.
