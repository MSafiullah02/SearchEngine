As shown in Fig. 1\nB and C, the amounts of LRG mRNA increased slightly and gradually at 12\u201324 h after the stimulation with the IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1, respectively. On the contrary, the amounts of LRG mRNA abruptly increased 5-fold at 2 h after the stimulation with IL-6, reached its maximum at 6 h, and markedly decreased less than the basal level at 24 h (Fig. 1D). IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 had synergistic actions on the expression of LRG mRNA induced by IL-6 (Fig. 1E and F, respectively). The amount of LRG mRNA induced by using a combination of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, and that for a combination of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 were 2 and 1.5-fold greater, respectively, than that induced by IL-6 alone. Furthermore, a marked decrease in the expression of LRG mRNA, found at 24 h after the stimulation with IL-6, was attenuated by coexisting IL-1\u03b2 or TNF\u03b1. IL-6 was known to be the major regulator of APP synthesis in human hepatocytes [1], [14]. These results show that the LRG expression in HepG2 cells is up-regulated by IL-6, and IL-6 acts synergistically with coexisting IL-1\u03b2 or TNF\u03b1.",

Although the synergistic effects of IL-1\u03b2 on the expression of LRG mRNA was less prominent than those for the expressions of SAA and PLA2 mRNAs, the present result strongly suggests that LRG belongs to type 1 APPs.",

LRG expression was examined in mouse liver at 6 h after intraperitoneal injections of various concentrations of LPS. As shown in Fig. 3\n, LPS was found to induce a dose-dependent enhancement of the expression of LRG mRNA as well as those for the mRNAs of major APPs in mouse, SAA and SAP. The expression of LRG mRNA was most strongly correlated with the dose of LPS (r\n = 0.51, P\n = 0.006) in comparison with those of the mRNAs of SAA (r\n = 0.47, P\n = 0.012) and SAP (r\n = 0.35, P\n = 0.071). The expression of LRG mRNA was highly correlated with that of SAA mRNA (r\n = 0.60, P\n = 0.0007). Although we could not quantify the LRG concentrations in the sera of LPS-treated mice in the present study, it is reasonable to conclude that the dose-dependent increase in the level of hepatic LRG mRNA results in the dose-dependent increase in the serum level of LRG protein.",

But it was shown that LRG level in the sera of the patients with TSS did not correlate with the CRP level [19].

Therefore, we assumed that LRG might function as a PLA2 inhibitory protein and thus bind a PLA2 molecule as a natural ligand on the basis of our previous study on the PLI\u03b2 which was isolated from the sera of venomous snake [6]. However, the purified mouse LRG did not show any PLA2 inhibitory activities (Shirai et al., unpublished results). Since PLI\u03b2 from the venomous snake sera binds specifically basic PLA2 included in its own venom and inhibit its enzymatic activity, it was suggested that PLI\u03b2 directly participate in the clearance of venom PLA2 for self-protection against its own venom. Recently, Cummings et al. found that LRG bound strongly to Cyt c\n[20] and, therefore, Cyt c might be one of the natural ligands of LRG. Since high concentrations of extracellular Cyt c have been reported to induce arthritis [21], LRG might directly participate in the clearance of Cyt c which may be released from the apoptotic neutrophils after bacterial infections.",

(B) Comparison of the expressions of LRG, SAA, and PLA2 mRNAs in HepG2 cells at 4 h after stimulations with 10 ng/ml IL-6 alone, 10 ng/ml IL-6 and 10 ng/ml IL-1\u03b2, and 10 ng/ml IL-6 and 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1. The amounts of the respective mRNAs were measured by real-time quantitative RT-RCR. The relative expression levels of each mRNA were corrected with that of GAPDH mRNA and then compared with that for an unstimulated control sample. Values are means \u00b1 SD of two independent determinations.",
