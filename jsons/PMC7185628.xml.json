In particular, virus mutants are serious infectious pathogens because of their rapid infection speed, high infectivity and severe painful symptoms as well as the economic losses associated with their spread. Efforts to prevent such infections and develop vaccines against the viruses are underway [4]. The avian influenza virus (AIV) is particularly regarded as a highly contagious virus that infects humans and birds and, in the past, it has caused economic issues and health problems [5,6]. The highly pathogenic H5N1 AIV infection can be transferred from birds to humans and can cause death. Usually, bird flu can only infect bird species. However, AIV mutants (H5N1) can infect humans as well [7]. Furthermore, if a human is infected with H5N1 AIV, the virus can exchange genetic information with the human flu virus and then spread to other individuals.",

            "text": "To prevent the spread of H5N1 AIV, several techniques have been proposed to identify H5N1, including surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) [8], enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [9], electrochemical (EC) assays [10], quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) [11], Luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) [12], surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [[13], [14], [15]], and fluorescence [16] techniques. In order to create a portable H5N1 detection system for field use, it is important to meet the requirements of accuracy, high sensitivity, high throughput, specificity, fast signal response time, small sample size, and ease of use in the field. Among these, the optical biosensor-based localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) method has been studied for high sensitivity, easy fabrication, and cost-effectiveness [17,18]. Introduction of plasmonic nanostructures to virus detection could facilitate the field-ready portable biosensor construction. The electron oscillation originating from electromagnetic waves triggers a binding interaction event in the nanoparticle interface, thus providing high sensitivity [19]. Moreover, this plasmonic event can be tuned to excite the fluorescence dye-labeled bioprobe that exhibits ultra-sensitivity in order to detect the H5N1 virus [20,21]. Advanced bioprobes have been developed to detect H5N1 accurately with high sensitivity. Among these, DNA aptamers are one of the powerful elements used to construct an AIV biosensor [22,23]. However, to construct the aptasensor, a labeling process and immobilization process are usually required to enhance signals and fabricate the electrode. These processes are quite complicated, time-consuming, and laborious. Furthermore, conventional DNA only has two terminal groups at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032, which limits embodying the multi-functionality and complicates the manufacture processes related to immobilization, labeling, and detection.",

            "text": "To overcome the present limitation, this study introduced the DNA 3-way junction (3 W J) that can introduce multi-functionality [24,25]. Compared to packaging RNA 3 W J (pRNA 3 W J), DNA 3 W J showed the less stability [[26], [27], [28]]. However, for the biosensor construction, the production cost issue should also be considered. DNA 3 W J is cheaper than same sequence of RNA 3 W J for constructing MF-DNA bioprobe. Each end of the DNA arm was modified to perform the biosensor function. The 5\u2032 end of the DNA 3 W Ja was tagged to an HA protein recognition aptamer (HA Apt/3 W Ja). The 5\u2032 end of DNA 3 W Jb was labeled with FAM dye (FAM/3 W Jb) for signal enhancement. It is reported that the fluorescence dye can be excited by a plasmonic field, which increases the detection sensitivity effectively [20,21]. To increase the LSPR enhancement effect, FAM dye was introduced. Moreover, the LSPR enhancement effect by fluorescence dye needs to adequate distance between fluorophore and nanoparticle surface [29,30]. The FAM-tagged DNA 3 W J showed the high rigidity and provide the defined distance around 5\u20136 nm between FAM and hAuSN surface for making LSPR effect. As the rest of module, the 5\u2032 end of DNA 3 W Jc was labeled with a thiol-group (SH/3 W Jc) that enabled bioprobe immobilization without an additional linkage process. These functional DNA pieces were assembled well by annealing. The hAuSN-modified ITO substrate was also prepared by atmospheric plasma treatment and silanization. hAuSN has a unique local refractive index (RI) and high surface roughness that can provide increased bioprobe immobilization chances compared to normal Au nanoparticles [31]. This transparent substrate can provide a detection platform for LSPR. Synthesis of hAuSN was confirmed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The immobilization process of the multi-functional DNA 3 W J on the hAuSN-modified ITO substrate was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The sensing performance of the proposed biosensor was investigated by UV-VIS, which showed the high sensitivity of longitudinal LSPR intensity to detect the HA protein.

Fig. 4\na shows the UV-VIS absorption spectra with various concentrations (600 ppm, 1200 ppm, 1800 ppm, 3000 ppm, and 4200 ppm) of the hAuSN layer. Because of free electron absorption, the hAuSN layer absorbed light throughout the visible ranges and an absorption peak was observed at around 541 nm. When the hAuSN concentration was changed, the LSPR peak intensity was changed. From 600 ppm (red line) to 3000 ppm (green line), the LSPR peak intensity was gradually increased. However, at 4200 ppm of hAuSN-modified ITO the LSPR peak intensity was decreased (Fig. 4b). This effect might be elucidated by hampered light transmission due to physical adsorption and unreacted particles of hAuSN.

Fig. 5b shows the absorbance peaks of SH-modified DNA 3 W J (yellow line), MB/SH-modified DNA 3 W J (green line), and FAM/SH-modified DNA 3 W J (cobalt line), respectively. Comparison with SH-DNA 3 W J and MB/SH-DNA 3 W J, little absorbance change was observed. However, in the case of FAM/SH-DNA 3 W J, a substantially increased LSPR band was observed compared to that with SH-DNA 3 W J. Presumably, the results showed that the fluorescent dye molecule in the DNA could couple with the surface plasmon that confers a high refractive index onto the DNA 3 W J-modified hAuSN substrate [21]. Based on the combined result, the prepared nanobio heterolayer can be used to effectively detect HA protein.",

The LSPR band was obtained corresponding to the HA protein concentration (0 pM to 100 nM). To analyze the detection performance and limit of detection (LOD), various concentrations of serially diluted HA protein in PBS buffer were used. As shown in Fig. 6\na, the LSPR peak intensity increased with increasing HA protein concentration between 1 pM to 100 nM. This clearly showed a linear relationship between LSPR intensity and HA protein concentration in this range with an R2 of 0.9976 (Fig. 6b).",

In this study, the authors developed an LSPR biosensor composed of DNA 3 W J on a hAuSN -modified ITO electrode. The MF-DNA was introduced as a multi-functional bioprobe for simultaneous HA protein detection, LSPR signal enhancement, and immobilization. Construction of the multi-functional DNA was confirmed by TBM-PAGE. The hAuSN-modified ITO substrate can be easily prepared and provides a suitable detection platform for LSPR methods. AFM and FE-SEM experiments were carried out to investigate the surface topography of the hAuSN-modified ITO substrate. Moreover, LSPR measurements were then carried out to determine HA protein binding to DNA 3 W J on the hAuSN-modified electrode. For the clinical test, specificity tests and LOD tests were carried out. Respective LSPR-based AIV detection platforms have been developed. However, the proposed method can perform each experiment on a single platform without an additional labeling, immobilization, and target amplification processes. In the near future, this simple H5N1 biosensor fabrication method can be used as a powerful alternative for virus detection platforms.",
