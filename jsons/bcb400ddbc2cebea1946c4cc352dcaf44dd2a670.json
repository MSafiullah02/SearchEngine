The Protein A and affi nity-purifi ed cat anti-FCoV IgG are blotted on the test line and the control line, respectively, of the nitrocellulose membrane. The specifi c detection of anti-FCoV antibodies was possible in all heparin-anticoagulated plasma, serum, whole blood, and ascitic fl uid samples from anti-FCoV antibody positive cats, and nonspecifi c reaction was not noted in samples from anti-FCoV antibody negative cats.",

Both serotypes consist of two biotypes: feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). FECV infection is asymptomatic in cats, whereas FIPV infection causes lethal disease: FIP [ 3 ] . FIPV (virulent FCoV) has been proposed to arise from FECV (avirulent FCoV) due to a mutation [ 4 -6 ] ; however, the exact mutation and inducing factors have not yet been clarifi ed.",
