First, we agree with the opinion that computed tomography (CT) is not the first line test to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the reference standard for definitive COVID-19 diagnosis. The infection control unit in the CT suites requires specialized knowledge, equipment, and manpower. Inadequate preparation and infection protocol may cause in-hospital transmission from the CT suites. Many patients undergoing CT scanning have underlying diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, and so on). The COVID-19 pneumonia is likely to be serious in such patients [2] and, therefore, we have to be careful with infection control in the CT suites. However, CT may play a complementary or alternative role to the standard RT-PCR test because its sensitivity to detect COVID-19 lung diseases is reportedly higher than that of RT-PCR under circumstances of extremely high prevalence rates [3] .",

Careful cleaning is also necessary after scanning of each COVID-19 patient, and air change should be performed, if necessary.",
