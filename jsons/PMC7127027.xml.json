            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a contagious respiratory disease in humans which is caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).1, 2, 3 The key enzyme in the processing of polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, translated by the viral RNA genome of SARS-CoV is called a 3C-like protease (3CL protease). Due to its functional importance in the viral life cycle, SARS-CoV 3CL protease is considered to be an attractive target for a drug for SARS therapy. For this reason, a variety of 3CL protease inhibitors have been reported in the literature over the past decade.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 They are non-peptidyl compounds derived from natural products and/or substrate-based peptidemimetics. However, no effective therapeutic drug or vaccine has been developed to date, although many candidates targeting SARS 3CL protease have been identified. In a research program on SARS 3CL protease, we found for the first time that mature SARS 3CL protease is subject to degradation at the 188Arg/189Gln site. R188I mutant protease with high activity and stability was prepared.10 Although our group additionally found that tetrapeptide aldehyde Ac-Thr-Val-Cha-His-H (1) showed high inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 98 nM against SARS 3CL R188I mutant protease in 2008,12 there are generally enzymatic digestions of peptide chains and \u03b1-proton racemization. Next, we designed and synthesized serine derivatives focusing on the P1, P2 and P4 sites of tetrapeptide aldehyde (1) by the combination of docking simulation and a structure activity relationship study. As for the results, SK23 (2) was given as a candidate compound against SARS 3CL R188I mutant protease.13 In this case, the inhibitory activity of SK23 (2) was much lower than the peptide aldehyde inhibitor (1). However, SK23 (2) has no thiol capture unit and achieved a marked structural transformation from peptidyl compounds based on a substrate mimic strategy. Investigation of a scaffold with three essential functional groups is needed to develop small molecular inhibitors using a serine scaffold for non-peptidyl compounds (Fig. 1\n).",

            "text": "We performed a variety of molecular mechanics calculations with SPARTAN from Wavefunction and docking simulations of protein interactions using GOLD from CCDC for the 1,2-hydroxyamine compounds in-house. In an attempt to give good coverage of the substrate-recognition pocket of SARS 3CL R188I mutant protease (PDB code 3AW1), we found that the isoserine backbone had reasonable interactions with the mutant protease to give an isoserine derivative (3), which can be considered to replace the amine group at the \u03b1-position and a hydroxy group at the \u03b2-position of SK23 (2). Using the docking simulation of the (R)-isomer (3) with SARS 3CL protease, there was a hydrophobic space on the S2 pocket of the R188I mutant protease with the (R)-isomer (3). In the comparison with several hydrophobic functionalities, alkane, cycloalkane and aromatic rings, the phenyl group was fitted on the S2 pocket of the R188I mutant protease to obtain a (2R,3S)-PIS derivative (4). The docking simulations of the other three stereoisomers of (2R,3S)-4 hardly interacted with the R188I mutant protease and therefore the (2R,3S)-isomer (4) as a candidate for this research was selected. The (2R,3S)-PIS derivative (4) has the following characteristics: (a) The substrates by nature have involved small amino acids (Ser, Ala or Gly) at the P1\u2032 position of SARS 3CL protease. However, it may be preferable to adopt the phenyl group, which was optimized as the serine-type inhibitor SK23 (2).13 (b) As with SK23 (2), the cyclohexyl ring may have the essential functionality of the P1 position, as well as stabilizing interactions of other positions. (c) The substrates at the P2 position are Leu, Val, Phe and Met with the hydrophobic side chains and therefore the S2 pocket is rather hydrophobic in nature. Consequently, the phenyl ring makes good contact with target regions. This is interesting in the results of docking simulations. The S2 pocket of the R188I mutant protease barely allowed the phenyl functionality of the serine-type inhibitor. (d) Although the S4 pocket prefers hydrophobic side chains (Ala, Val or Pro), aromatic derivatives on the synthetic substrates are acceptable. Especially, cinnamoyl residues play an important role to interact with the mutant protease. This result strongly supports those of Bai\u2019s15 and our13 information (Scheme 1\n).",

Functionalities of the P1\u2032 position (A) of 5 were designed and synthesized to evaluate its inhibitory activity against the R188I mutant (4). In other words, a cyclohexyl ring was essential for functionality of the P1 position on the PIS scaffold in the preliminary studies. Inhibitory activities of the synthesized PIS derivatives in absence of the cyclohexyl ring at the P2 position showed extremely weak activity against SARS 3CL R188I mutant protease (IC50\n > 1 mM).

After the saponification of the methyl ester of 6, coupling of the resultant carboxylic acid with cyclohexylamine by DMT-MM16/DIPEA gave the PIS amide (7) in 54% yield over 2 steps. Deprotection of the Cbz group of 7 by hydrogenolysis and coupling between the resultant amino group and cinnamic acid with DMT-MM/DIPEA successfully proceeded to afford the cinnamoyl derivative (8) in satisfactory yield. TFA-assisted deprotection of the MOM group gave the alcohol (9) in 76% yield. Finally, treatment of the alcohol (9) with BzCl/NaI/DIPEA in CH2Cl2 gave the target compound (4) in 80% yield without any problems. On the other hand, the P1\u2032 moiety of the hydroxy group of 9 was introduced by coupling with the five cinnamic acid derivatives prepared by us in the previous literature13 to afford 10\u201314 in lower yields. Thus, a variety of the coupling reagents was employed between the PIS derivative (9) with a large steric hindrance and cinnamic acid, it was difficult to improve the chemical yields of the corresponding ester (10). As a result, we selected DMT-MM/DIPEA or HATU17, 18/HOAt/DIPEA in CH2Cl2 as the coupling conditions to give the desired materials (10)-(14).

Synthetic PIS derivatives with modification at the P1\u2032 position were evaluated as IC50 values shown in Table 1\n. The PIS derivative (4; SK80) designed by docking simulations exhibited an IC50 value of 43 \u03bcM (entry 1). The serine type inhibitor SK23 (2), which has same functionalities, showed an IC50 value of 30 \u03bcM and therefore we expected that the active site of the 3CL R188I mutant protease fitted with these ligands via similar binding modes. To investigate the importance of the benzoyl carbonyl group at the P1\u2032 position, the benzyl ether (16) was evaluated. As a result, 16 showed no inhibitory activity (entry 2). In addition, the PIS derivative with a phenolic hydroxyl group (11) and the synthetic intermediate with a hydroxyl group (9) also showed lower inhibitory activities (IC50\n > 500 \u03bcM) (entries 3 and 4). These results were expected from the docking simulations and structure activity relationship study of serine type inhibitors in our previous report. Next, the PIS derivatives with modified cinnamoyl groups were evaluated. The IC50 values of 14 and 13 were 250 and 125 \u03bcM, respectively (entries 5 and 6). The inhibitors containing 3,5- and/or 4-methoxy groups on a phenyl ring exhibited moderate activities. In contrast, cinnamate derivatives 10, 17 and the phenylpropanoate derivative 18 increased the inhibitory activities to show the IC50 values of 65\u201385 \u03bcM (entries 7, 8, 9). The CH2O of Cbz group of 17 and the double bond of cinnamoyl group of 10 played a similar role and consequently both the phenyl rings interact with the S4 pocket to show approximately same activities. The inhibitor containing a 3-methoxy group on a phenyl ring (12) had 65 \u03bcM as an IC50 value (entry 10). These results suggested that a planar aromatic ring and its hydrophobic functionality were essential factors to produce a reasonable 3CL protease inhibitor. Although the methoxy groups of the phenyl rings had increased infrequently inhibitory activities against SARS 3CL protease in our previous studies, there is hardly critical influence. As with SK23 (2), the benzoyl group at P1\u2032 position was optimized to give the inhibitor 4. To show reasonable IC50 values against SARS 3CL protease, it is important to satisfy both conditions with around 6 for C log P values and 65\u201390 for tPSA. A similar tendency can also be seen in the structure activity relationship study of serine-type inhibitors (Table 1).",

            "text": "The binding mode of the SK80 (4) to SARS 3CL protease predicted by docking simulation using GOLD software is exhibited in Fig. 2\n. Based on these results, we decided to synthesize and evaluate inhibitory activity against SARS 3CL mutant protease. It appears to be a reasonable binding mode by the surface mode of the protease with SK80 (4) shown in Fig.2A. The functionalities at the P1\u2032, P1, P2 and P4 sites of SK80 (4) were located on the S1\u2032, S1, S2 and S4 pockets with hydrophobic spaces, respectively. As depicted in Fig.2B, two amide groups of SK80 (4) were involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with His164 and Gln189. These interactions of SK80 (4) with the R188I mutant protease were found to be identical to those of SK23 (2) with the protease. This suggests that carbonyl of the benzoyl group of the inhibitor (4) interacts with the active site of Cys145 and His41 of SARS 3CL protease. Interestingly, the distances of hydrogen and oxygen between the two amide groups of SK80 (4) as the docking simulation exhibited 2.1 and 3.1 \u00c5, respectively. These values are reasonable to estimate the intramolecular hydrogen bonding networks. Therefore, the fixed eight-membered cyclic structure in the scaffold motif of SK80 (4) is proposed to locate the active site of SARS 3CL mutant protease by induced fit (Fig.2C). In comparison with the stable conformation of SK80 (4) in absence of the SARS 3CL protease, a molecular mechanics calculation for conformational analysis by SPARTAN\u201914 was attempted (Fig.2D). The distances of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the corresponding two amide groups of 4 showed 2.0 and 5.3 \u00c5, respectively. This result suggests that the conformation of 4 by the intramolecular hydrogen bond of two amide groups is partly fixed to increase the inhibitory activities against the SARS 3CL mutant protease. We conclude that the two amide groups of SK80 (4) interact to form inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bondings and the binding of the SARS 3CL mutant protease and SK80 (4) using induced fit are shown (Fig. 2).",
