Although Coronaviridae is not new to the human\npopulation, SARS-CoV-2 is a larger threat as it has a much higher reproduction\nnumber (R0) than previous coronavirus strains, meaning\nthat the number of cases generated by one infected person is higher than previous\noutbreaks.9\u221213 This, coupled with longer\nincubations times, latent infections, and delayed symptoms, makes the virus\ndifficult to contain.",

For example, within the\n2009 article by Dellano et al., the authors analyzed effectiveness of common\nhousehold disinfectants (one being Lysol with 0.1% w/v of BAC and \u226470%\nethanol) against murine hepatitis virus (MHV, a surrogate vector with structural\nsimilarities to SARS but lower biosafety level).6 They found\nthat the BAC formulations were effective at inactivating this class of virus after\nonly 30 s exposure (Table 1). This result\nwas echoed in the previous 1989 article by Sattar et al. when analyzing BAC and\nethanol mixtures.20 Additionally, Sattar et al. analyzed toilet\nbowl cleaners (with a solution of 0.04% w/v of BAC and hydrochloric acid, pH 1.0).\nThis formulation was again proven to be effective at inactivating coronaviruses,\nalthough this lower concentration of BAC was only able to affect a 3-log reduction\n(99.9% reduction) in viral load in the absence of additives. Both articles point\nto the difficulty proving if combinatorial formulations lead to efficacy, or if\nthe QACs aid in the viral reduction.",
