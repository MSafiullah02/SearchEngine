            "text": "The first parvovirus to be detected in the human population was found in 1975 during routine screening of blood donors [1, 2] . Working in Australia, Yvonne Cossart found a parvovirus-like antigen in the sera of nine healthy blood donors and two patients. The spherical particles were 21-23 nm in diameter and a corresponding antibody was found to be widely distributed in the population. Because the original sample in which the parvovirus-like particles were seen was coded 'B19' this became the name of the human parvovirus. Following this chance discovery, a few years elapsed before a survey of serum samples archived at King's College Hospital, London revealed an association between B19 virus infection and aplastic crisis in children with sickle cell anaemia [3] . Later in 1981 it was reported that 24 of 28 young children in Jamaica with sickle cell anaemia who had an aplastic crisis were infected with a parvovirus [4] and similar findings were reported concerning adult patients with sickle cell anaemia in Chicago where aplastic crisis was associated with acute infection with a human parvovirus [5] . In 1983, the virus was shown to be the cause of a childhood rash called erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) [6] , and this was confirmed 2 years later by experimentally infecting human volunteers with the virus [7] . The final step in characterising the virus, which appears to infect and damage early erythroid progenitor cells, was to characterise, clone and sequence the genome of the virus, and this established definitively that it was a parvovirus [8, 9] . However when the sequence was analysed in detail, it was phylogenetically distinct from the existing genera (Parvovirus and Dependovirus), and so was placed in a new genus named Erythrovirus.",

Whilst evaluating the method, they detected two previously unknown bovine parvoviruses in the bovine serum used as diluent. When sequenced, the two viruses were distinct, but different from all other known parvoviruses except a virus of dogs, Canine minute virus. So it was decided by the ICTV to include the bovine and canine viruses in a new genus to be named Bocavirus, of the subfamily Parvovirinae within the family Parvoviridae [11] . When Allander et al. now working in Sweden, applied the virus discovery method to screening of pooled human respiratory tract samples, they found a novel human coronavirus (which is related by sequence to the newly described human coronavirus HKU1 [12] ), and a novel human parvovirus, which is related by sequence to the genus Bocavirus, and so has been provisionally named human bocavirus [13] .",
