Here, we developed and validated chest CT-based imaging biomarkers for COVID-19 patient screening. We identified the vasculature-like signals from CT images and found that, compared to healthy and community acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, the COVID-19 patients revealed significantly higher abundance of these signals. Furthermore, unsupervised feature learning leads to the discovery of clinical-relevant imaging biomarkers from the vasculature-like signals for accurate and sensitive COVID-19 screening that has been double-blindly validated in an independent hospital (sensitivity: 0.941, specificity: 0.904, AUC: 0.952).

Specifically, in this study, we used single network layer with 256 dictionary elements (i.e., signal patterns) at a fixed pattern size of 20x20x20 pixels and a fixed sampling rate of 100 3D patches per sample which were experimentally optimized. In the training cohort, 8 of 256 dictionary elements were identified to have significant correlation with COVID-19 with cutoff FDR value < 0.05 through cross-validation approach (training sample rate: 0.8; bootstrap 100 times). At last, these 8 significant dictionary elements as a set of imaging biomarkers were selected and utilized to build the random decision forests model for COVID-19 screening. A double-blind study was designed and implemented to validate this model in an independent hospital. Visualization of these imaging biomarkers was created in three-dimensional space using ITK-Snap (version 3.8.0), Python (version 3.7.0), Matplotlib (version 3.1.2), Blender (version 2.82) and Three.js (version r115 on GitHub). Snapshots of the three-dimensional visualization were used to generate two-dimensional visualization that overlays with the original CT slices.",

These findings are consistent with the observation of vascular changes in lung tissue from COVID-19 patients, including vascular congestion/enlargement, small vessels hyperplasia and vessel wall thickening [11, 12] . Furthermore, such distinction itself leads to remarkable differentiation between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups in our training cohort (AUC=0.721, Extended Data Fig. 2 , blue curve) with logistic regression approach. Altogether, those results encourage us to identify imaging biomarkers from the \"vasculature-like signal\" space to assist accurate screening of COVID-19.",

These biomarkers also allow the construction of full 3D multispectral staining in the entire lung region (Fig. 2a) , which is further demonstrated in 3D animations ( Supplementary Videos 1-3) . The corresponding 2D multispectral staining into the CT image slices are also constructed ( Supplementary Videos 4-6) .

Specifically, in Europe and the United States, there are tens of thousands of new confirmed cases and suspected cases every day[13-16]. These sharply increased cases of COVID-19 are running out of medical resources in some countries to varying degrees and are paralyzing the medical system in some countries [17] . Therefore, rapid screening, diagnosis, isolation and treatment of COVID-19 patients are particularly important for the prevention and control of the epidemic. However, it is unfortunate that nucleic acid detection kits for COVID-19 have been in short supply in many countries. At the same time, due to improper operation, technical variations among different nucleic acid detection kits and many other reasons, the results of nucleic acid test have certain false negatives. On the other hand, CT examination has been proved to have unique advantages in the early screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 [11, 18] . To discover new possibility for COVID-19 screening, this study utilized an unsupervised deep learning method to identify robust imaging biomarkers .

Furthermore, our imaging biomarkers may provide a new avenue for predicting COVID-19 patients' prognosis and clinical outcome, which will be further investigated in our future research. ",
