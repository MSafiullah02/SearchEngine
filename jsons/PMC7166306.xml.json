The virus causing the epidemic was detected as a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and the resulting pneumonia was then named by the WHO as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [[2], [3], [4]]. As of March 17, 2020, a total of 81,118 patients in China have been diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19, and 68,802 patients were cured and discharged [5]. At the same time, the number of suspected cases has also decreased significantly. This shows that China's epidemic prevention policy has achieved initial results. However, the infection has spread to over 48 countries worldwide, especially in Iran, Korea and some European countries, even affecting the United States. The global risk of this epidemic was escalated to the highest level by the WHO on February 28. Fast and effective diagnostic methods for this disease are of great importance at present.",

Its limited production and relatively long testing period might not be conducive for screening. Accumulated clinical experience suggests that early chest computed tomography might be helpful in the differential diagnosis of suspected cases. Recently, Chung, Fang and Kanne, etc. reported the chest CT imaging features of COVID-19 [[8], [9], [10]]. Fang and Ai further studied the sensitivity of chest CT compared to RT-PCR with a relatively small sample [9,11]. However, there is no agreed standard for how to confirm a diagnosis of COVID-19 with these features. We retrospectively collected chest CT images of suspected pneumonia patients, divided them according to the results of RT-PCR tests into positive and negative groups and then compared the differences in CT features between the two groups. Our goal is to use statistical methods to distinguish the imaging features of COVID-19 from other infectious chest diseases and evaluate the diagnostic value of chest CT for suspected COVID-19 patients.",

These findings are similar to those in previous descriptive studies on COVID-19 [8,10,13,14] and also overlap with the imaging features of other viral pneumonias. For this reason, we estimated the pathological mechanism of COVID-19 involves transmission though the respiratory tract and damage to the terminal bronchioles and lung parenchyma near the bronchioles in the early stages, which in turn affect the entirety of the lung lobules and results in diffuse alveolar damage, similar to other viral pneumonias [15]. Apparently, the imaging features of COVID-19 greatly resemble those of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), which are other members of the coronavirus family [[16], [17], [18], [19]].",

Previous studies have to date merely described the dynamic changes in the chest CT imaging of COVID-19 and presented the features currently used in the diagnosis of the disease [8,10,13,14,21]. Some of them focused on the sensitivity compared to that of RT-PCR with a relatively small sample size, but they did not compare these features with those of other viral pneumonias or explain how a differential diagnosis could be made by chest CT [9,11].

Therefore, we combined several statistically significant imaging features to evaluate the diagnostic value of chest CT scans. Apparently, the combination of features resulted in relatively low sensitivity but extremely high specificity. The average specificity of all combinations was approximately 90%, and the combination of GGOs with the crazy-paving pattern and bilateral pulmonary distribution showed the highest specificity at 99% when three items were combined. The use of a four-item combination also resulted in 99% specificity. In conclusion, the combinations of GGO with different features from chest CT might significantly increase the specificity in the diagnosis of COVID-19. This means that in a series presenting crazy-paving patterns, air bronchograms, bilateral lower pulmonary distributions, bilateral lower pulmonary distributions and pleural distributions, as long as they appear simultaneously with GGOs on chest CT, COVID-19 should be highly suspected, even if the patient has repeated negative RT-PCR outcomes. This might help emergency physicians identify COVID-19 patients faster and more effectively. Based on accumulated experience, we recommend that these patients be quarantined and have their RT-PCR tests repeated until the average incubation ends, especially in areas with severe outbreaks. Epidemiological exposure, RT-PCR tests and chest CT scans are equally critical to diagnosis.",

Therefore, the expression of time may not be precise enough according to the development of this disease. Second, the current gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is merely the RT-PCR test [6].
