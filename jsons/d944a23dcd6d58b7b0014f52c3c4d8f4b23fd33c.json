In order to gain a dynamic description of the binding process that is key to infection, we use molecular simulations with a coarse grained model of the RBD and ACE2. We find that binding occurs in an all-or-none way, without intermediates, and that even in the bound state, the RBD exhibits a highly dynamic behaviour. From short equilibrium simulations started in the unbound state we provide snapshots that result in a tentative mechanism of binding. Our findings may be important for the development of drug discovery strategies that target the RBD. * david.desancho@ehu.eus",

The resulting 2 s of simulation data at each temperature were projected on an order parameter for binding, the logarithm of the RMS , that collapses the unbound state into a narrow well and expands the bound state (see Supplementary Methods) . The simulations are well converged, as shown by cumulative averages that do not change after 0.8 s at each temperature (see Supplementary   Information Fig. S2 ). In Figure 2A we show potentials of mean force derived using the weighted histogram analysis method WHAM [21] . The free energy surface suggests that the RBD:ACE2 complex formation occurs in an all-or-none way, with a dominant free energy barrier between the bound and unbound states. Despite the absence of stable intermediates, the bound state has a small intra-state barrier. The presence of two sub-basins in the bound state with average values of log( RMS ) of \u22120.45 and \u22120.75 is also apparent in the two dimensional free energy landscape we show in Figure 2B , including also a folding coordinate for the RBD, the fraction of native contacts ( RBD , see Supplementary Methods).",

As anticipated, fluctuations are primarily localized in the ridge region, both in the unbound and in the bound form of the protein, although in the former they extend a bit longer to the receptor binding region. We see that upon binding, fluctuations decrease considerably in the RBD but they remain larger than average in the receptor binding ridge. Importantly, the ridge region could not be properly resolved in recent cryo-EM structures of the spike protein [4] . Also, structural disorder is predicted to appear around residue 150 of RBD from multiple servers [22] . Finally, the location of the fluctuations of the coarse-grained simulations is consistent with atomistic MD [23] ,",

In particular, we discern between contacts formed by the ridge residues and those in the remaining part of the extensive RBM. In all the binding events we have observed binding occurs first via the disordered region, which establishes the first few contacts, resulting in a decrease of log( RMS ). Then, the remaining part of the RBD rests on the ACE2 binding site, until the protein fully commits to the bound form. Representative snapshots help visualize how the extended, disordered part of the protein more efficiently searches for its binding partner, possibly due to a slightly increased capture radius (Figure 3 ). This is reminiscent of the so-called \"fly-casting\" mechanism that has been invoked to explain the kinetic advantage of intrinsically disordered proteins for binding [24] .",

There are several potential limitations in our work due to the coarse-grained nature of the model and the simplicity in the description of the interactions. First, the simulation model does not consider explicitly long-range charged interactions, although pairwise energy terms are residue-specific [18] . This prevents an adequate description of electrostatic steering effects that may speed up the binding process [26] . Additionally, we do not incorporate the glycosilation effects, although eperimental structures show that glycosilated sites in ACE2 and RBD are far from the binding interface and hence likely to be small.",

For example, by favouring a reductive environment for the virus that promotes reduction of disulfides would increase the conformational disorder of the receptor binding ridge even further.
