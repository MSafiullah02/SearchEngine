            "text": "In 2017, approximately 11 percent of non-institutionalized people of all ages living in the United States reported having a disability. Types of disabilities included visual, self-care, hearing, cognitive, disability related to living independently and disabilities ambulating in order from lowest to highest prevalence. In that year, the percentage of people ages 18-64 working full time was approximately 24%. Of those people of working age with a disability, 34% had a high school diploma as their highest level of education, 32% had some college and 15% had a bachelor's degree (Erickson, Lee, & Von Schrader, 2020). People with hearing disabilities were most likely to have some college compared to people with other types of disabilities. Those with disabilities related to living independently were the least likely to have any college education. An estimated 19% of people who'd graduated from high school or its equivalent reported having a disability (Erickson, Lee, & von Schrader, 2017). While the number of nurses with disabilities is unknown, 1 in 4 people in the United States has a disability (Centers for Disease Control, 2018). Nurses are likely to be among them.",

The ADA mandated, through three different statutes, that persons with disabilities be treated equitably in both public and private settings, such as businesses and schools. The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendment Act (ADAAA) of 2008 expanded on the original law. The ADAAA maintains the ADA's definition of the term disability \u201cas a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; a record (or past history) of such an impairment; or being regarded as having a disability.\u201d However, Congress expanded on the original law by making it clear that courts should interpret the definition of disability more broadly than the United States Supreme Court had instructed under the ADA as originally passed. Thus, for example chronic illness qualifies as a disability, as do temporary alterations in ability or health. In addition, if a nurse does not have a disability but cares for a family member with a disability or chronic illness, the amendment protects the nurse from discrimination should she/he need to miss work to care for the family member. Title I of the ADA addresses employment, in both the private and public sectors; Title II deals with public services; and Title III concerns \u201cpublic accommodations,\u201d which are private businesses open to the public (ADA, 1990).",

The primary reason for this seems to be concerns about safety, both for the student and the patients they will care for in their clinical placement practica. Despite this widespread belief, there is no evidence to indicate that a student or a nurse with a disability has jeopardized patient safety as a direct result of having a physical disability.",

Yet, we continue to be fearful about recruiting and admitting students with physical disabilities. Studies have shown that faculty misconceptions regarding what students with disabilities can do safely is the primary barrier to admitting and retaining these students (Carey, 2012; Davidson, et al., 2016; May, 2014; Neal-Boylan & Miller, 2018, Neal-Boylan & Miller, 2017).

The results from the qualitative study were difficult to generalize but it was clear there was a disconnect that begged further exploration.

None of the participants had low or no vision, very few had disabilities of communication while most had hearing disabilities or impairments. We postulated that people with vision or communication disabilities were not going into nursing. Most of the nurses with disabilities of hearing, left or contemplated leaving employment in hospital settings despite the minimal accommodations necessary to help them safely perform their jobs. They reported that the accommodations they were supposed to receive were not forthcoming or were ignored. For example, several nurses with hearing impairments asked for meeting minutes to be put in writing. This request was frequently ignored.",

Many nurses need to perform these functions but they don't typically perform them alone and they frequently have the assistance of people and technology. However, these requirements continue to be included as essential job functions to the detriment of nurses with disabilities. In fact, when nurses with disabilities sue their employers for violations of Title I of the ADA, employers often point to the fact that the nurse plaintiff could not meet the \u201cessential job function\u201d of lifting as a defense to the law suit. Unfortunately, courts are often willing to take the employer's definition of the nurse employee's essential job functions at face value, holding that the nurse is not otherwise qualified for the position. This high degree of deference to employer-provided job descriptions makes it more difficult for nurses to win cases under the ADA (Neal-Boylan & Miller, 2015). This is a frustrating reality for nurses with physical disabilities as it is far more relevant and important today to require critical thinking and sound judgment than heavy lifting.",
