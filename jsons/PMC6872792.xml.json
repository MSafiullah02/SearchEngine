In 2015, viral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths, the majority of which imputable to the effects of chronic HBV (hepatitis B virus) and HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection [1]. An estimated 5% of HBV-infected persons are also co-infected with HDV (hepatitis delta virus), which worsens the clinical outcome compared to HBV monoinfection [1]. Less than 5% of overall hepatitis mortality is caused by HAV (hepatitis A virus) and HEV (hepatitis E virus), that are usually associated with acute, self-limiting disease [1]. However, the case fatality rate of HEV is particularly high in specific groups, notably pregnant women and elderly individuals [2]. Although rare, infection with HAV can also cause acute liver failure and death, and the risk increases with age [3]. Despite the existence of a safe and effective vaccine, HAV remains a common cause of acute viral hepatitis in many regions of the world [4].",

In recent years, the availability of high-throughput technologies has revealed that relatives of human hepatitis viruses can be found in a wide variety of animals. This finding, as well as the increasing availability of the genome sequences of human-infecting viruses sampled across different geographic areas, has largely expanded our knowledge about the genetic diversity and evolutionary origin of these human pathogens. In this Review, we thus focus on the latest insights into the possible events and ecological contexts that determined the origin and spread of human hepatitis viruses. A short presentation of the most widely used approaches to estimate the ages of viral lineages is also provided to contextualize recent research efforts on these viruses.",

            "text": "Molecular dating analyses using virus genetic data can be particularly informative due to the rapid rate of evolution of many viral species. By converting genetic differences among sequences into time units, molecular dating provides information on the timing of viral spread or emergence. Most molecular dating approaches are based on maximum-likelihood or Bayesian phylogenetic frameworks [5], [6], and they usually exploit two strategies: molecular clock calibration using the sampling dates of the viral sequences (tip dating) and/or calibration using information on some internal nodes of the phylogeny. Tip dating is well-suited to study relatively recent events (e.g., epidemics or intra-host evolution), but requires that a temporal signal is present in the dataset (i.e., that the sequences have accumulated a measurable amount of change between sampling times) [6]. Calibration using internal nodes can in principle allow to dig deeper into the past, but requires some a priori knowledge about the virus evolutionary history (e.g., host-virus co-evolution, paleontological information). The widespread use of molecular dating has however revealed that the relationship between genetic divergence and time is complex, as evolutionary rates tend to vary with the time frame of measurement. In particular, high evolutionary rates are observed in the short term, whereas low rates are inferred in long time span studies [7], [8], [9]. This pattern was observed for many viral lineages and is sometimes referred to as the time-dependent rate phenomenon (TDRP) [10]. Failure to account for the TDRP can potentially lead to erroneous molecular dating results [10], [11].",

            "text": "The TDRP reflects mutation rate in very short timescales and substitution rate in very long timescales, during which transient deleterious mutations are removed by the action of natural selection, leading to lower rate estimates [12]. Another factor most likely contributing to the TDRP is the saturation of nucleotide substitutions, which is extremely rapid in viral genomes, especially when the polymerase is error-prone [12]. Thus, recent analyses indicated that, for all Baltimore classification groups, viral evolutionary rates tend to decrease continuously with the timescale of measurement [10], [11]. Because the rate of decay is consistent with a power law relationship between substitution rate and sampling timescale, a model using a simple regression was at first proposed to estimate the TDRP effect on viral phylogenies [10]. Very recently, this approach was implemented in a Bayesian statistical framework, in which evolutionary rates can vary among different time epochs [13]. Before the introduction of such an approach, effective attempts to correct for the TDRP were performed by the use of nucleotide substitution models that allow site- and branch-specific variation in selective pressure (selection-informed models). These models, which were applied to analyze the ancient evolution of some viral lineages, at least partially correct for the effects of both purifying selection and substitution saturation in branch length estimation [14], [15], [16].",

Several HAV-related viruses were identified in different mammalian orders. In particular, a number of HAV-like viruses were recovered in placental mammals, mainly in bats and rodents, but also in tree shrews, hedgehogs, seals and Chinese woodchucks [24], [25], [26]. Recently, de Oliveira Carneiro and colleagues [27] identified a novel HAV-related virus in Didelphis aurita, a Brazilian common opossum, further extending the host range of mammal-infecting hepatoviruses. Moreover, viruses related to mammalian hepatoviruses were detected in reptiles, amphibians, and fish [28]. These advances allowed new insights into the evolutionary history of HAV.",

This observation is supported by recombination events observed in hepatoviruses that have been identified in genetically and geographically distant hosts [29]. These cross-species transmission events also involved the opossum hepatovirus, which most likely originated from an ancestral host switch from rodents into marsupials [27]. Conversely, hepatovirus phylogenies suggest no host switch involving a primate donor. This evidence, the absence of recombination events between HAVs and non-primate hepatoviruses, as well as the observation that primate hepatoviruses form, regardless of the genomic region considered, a monophyletic group in the topology of hepatovirus phylogenies, support the hypothesis that humans and NHP have acquired hepatoviruses from other animal reservoirs relatively recently [24], [29].

In areas with a low prevalence (<2%), the most common mode of transmission is through infected blood or high-risk behaviors (e.g. unprotected sex or injecting drug use). In high- and intermediate- prevalence areas, HBV is commonly spread through perinatal and horizontal (especially among children) routes [33]. HBV belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family, which comprises two genera: Orthohepadnavirus (mammal-infecting viruses) and Avihepadnavirus (bird-infecting viruses) (Fig. 2A). Its genome, a partially double-stranded circular DNA of about 3.2 kb (Table 1), is composed of four overlapping frameshifted open reading frames (ORFs) [34]. Viral replication is carried out by a reverse transcriptase with no proofreading ability and considerable variability exists among strains. Thus, at least nine genotypes (A\u2013I) plus a tentative one (J), with a heterogeneous global distribution, have been described to date [35], [36], [37], [38], [39] (Fig. 2B).",

HBV was initially thought to have emerged quite recently in the New World from genotypes F/H infecting Amerindians [48], [49] (Fig. 2A and B). However, the discovery of an ancient strain in a 16th century Asian mummy, as well as the worldwide diffusion of hepadnaviruses in NHPs, questioned this hypothesis [50] (Fig. 2A). An alternative theory suggests that HBV followed the Out-of-Africa migration of modern humans, which occurred approximately 60,000 years ago [51], [52], [53]. In particular, Paraskevis et al. found a good correspondence between the demographic histories of HBV and those of human populations [53]. These authors also showed that the substantial divergence of the F and H genotypes (Fig. 2A), a major evidence in favor of the New World origin hypothesis [49], was probably due to positive selection acting on those branches [54]. Nonetheless, the extensive application of ancient DNA sequencing revealed a more complex scenario. In fact, two European Neolithic HBV genomes did not cluster with any extant human strain in the phylogenetic tree, but did cluster with NHP viruses [55] (Fig. 2A). Other authors [9], who sequenced 12 ancient HBV genomes of different ages (800\u20134500 years old), obtained a similar result, with the ancient strains clustering with known modern genotypes or forming new clades (Fig. 2A). This implies that some HBV lineages of the past went extinct (Fig. 2A). Moreover, Muhlemann and coworkers showed that the geographic distribution of ancient samples does not match the modern genotype distribution [9].

Thus, multiple zoonotic transmissions would have originated HBV genotypes found in humans [56]. This scenario is supported by the diffusion of hepadnaviruses in diverse primate species and by the inferred divergence time of the Orthohepadnavirus and Avihepadnavirus genera, that is very similar to that of their host classes [56]. However, the recent identification of a novel hepadnavirus in capuchin monkeys confirmed that New World monkeys are infected by viruses that are very distantly related to HBV (Fig. 2A), indicating that they do not represent the direct ancestors of genotypes H and F [41]. Instead, evolutionary analyses with human and NHP viral strains placed the origin of HBV ancestors in Hominoid Old World primates, preceding the formation of the human lineage [41].",

            "text": "In summary, although considerable progress was achieved in recent years, a high level of uncertainty concerning the ultimate origin of HBV still exists. The particular organization of the viral genome (i.e. overlapping reading frames in a short genome) limits the variability of most of nucleotide positions (i.e. to avoid the introduction of nonsynonymous mutations) and results in a relatively slow mutation rate. This characteristic, along with the action of natural selection on particular genotypes [54], as well as the adaptation to different human populations [34], contributes to HBV variability and complicates inferences about its origin. Finally, different studies [9], [50], [57] have shown that, as for other viruses (see Section 2), HBV substitution rates are affected by viral sampling time frames. Indeed, the evolutionary rates generated using information from ancient HBV genomes were shown to fit well with the TDRP regression line calculated for Baltimore Group VI and VII viruses (i.e., reverse-transcribing viruses) [11]. Crucially, these results indicate that, whereas tip calibration approaches have demonstrated to be useful in the reconstruction of recent epidemiological events [58], [59], [60], limiting analysis to extant strains for the reconstruction of ancient HBV evolution can be misleading [9] and that approaches that correct for the TDRP should be envisaged.",

For instance, one of the most affected countries is Egypt, where the virus was most likely disseminated through nationwide vaccination programs or contaminated blood-derived products [65]. In fact, sexual or vertical transmission of HCV are relatively rare, and the overwhelming majority of infections occur via the parenteral/percutaneous route. Thus, due to historical reasons and to the transmission pattern, a small number of so-called \u201cepidemic\u201d HCV subtypes (1a, 1b, 3a, and 2a) account for most infections worldwide [64], [66].",

Eight major HCV genotypes (HCV-1 to -8) have been described, and these are further divided into at least 90 subtypes (https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv_wikis/flaviviridae/w/sg_flavi/56/hcv-classification) (Fig. 3A). Several of these genotypes and subtypes were identified and classified only recently [67], [68], suggesting that a considerable proportion of HCV diversity remains undescribed.

            "text": "HCV genotypes display antigenic variability and viral genetic diversity is geographically structured: in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia highly divergent subtypes of the same genotype dominate transmissions across contiguous areas (Fig. 3A). These subtypes are referred to as \u201cendemic\u201d [62], [64] and their presence is consistent with a long-standing association of HCV with populations living in these regions. Because parenteral exposure became common only in the relatively recent past, several hypotheses were formulated to account for the maintenance of endemic HCV transmission. Some authors proposed that traditional practices such as circumcision, tattooing, piercing or acupuncture facilitated and maintained HCV infection among human populations [64], [69]. Others indicated that sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that disrupt mucosal integrity are responsible for increased sexual HCV transmission [70]. This was indeed shown to be the case in modern high-risk populations [71] and STIs have probably been common throughout human history [72]. An alternative scenario is that the bite of arthropods, especially those taking large blood meals, can mechanically transmit HCV, possibly from other animal reservoirs such as horses [73], [74]. HCV infection is in fact restricted to our species but, thanks to extensive field work, a number of hepaciviruses have been described in domestic and wild mammals, as well as in reptiles and fish [28], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83], [84] (Fig. 3B). At present, the largest diversity of hepacivirus species seems to be hosted by rodents and bats (Fig. 3B). Instead, as previously noted [75], the lowest genetic diversity is observed for hepaciviruses that infect cattle and horses (Fig. 3B), suggesting that husbandry practices may have resulted in the artificial selection of specific viral strains or facilitated recent viral transmission from some other animal source (e.g., commensal rodents). Non-human primates also host hepaciviruses, but these are highly divergent from HCV. Overall, the phylogenetic relationships among hepaciviruses poorly mirror those among their hosts (Fig. 3B), suggesting several cross-species and cross-order host switches during viral evolution. Up to now, the closest relatives of HCV were identified in horses/donkeys (equine hepacivirus, EHV) and dogs (canine hepacivirus, CHV) (Fig. 3B). Because CHV is less genetically diverse than EHV, the canine virus possibility originated as a recent cross-species transmission from horses [85], hinting at the ability of hepacivirus to shift among genetically distant hosts. Despite these advances, the events that led to the origin of HCV are still unknown. Taking as a fact the relatedness of the human virus to EHV/CHV, possible scenarios include that: i) HCV originated from a cross-species transmission of EHV, ii) that EHV was transmitted to horses by humans infected with HCV, which leaves the question on HCV origin open; iii) that HCV and EHV originated from the cross-species transmissions of the same (or similar) virus, with subsequent host adaptation and divergence. If this were the case, multiple cross-species transmission events may have originated distinct HCV genotypes [85].",

            "text": "Teasing apart these possibilities clearly requires understanding of the timing and circumstances of HCV (and EHV) evolution. Up to date, no archaeological sample carrying traces of HCV or EHV has been described and the oldest HCV sequence dates to 1953 [86] (1979 for EHV [82]). Thus, molecular dating efforts have relied on extant sequences, with the difficulties associated with the TDRP. Studies that did not account for the TDRP provided estimates of the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of HCV genotypes in a range between \u223c200 and 1000 years ago [64], [76], [87], [88], [63]; the origin of the horse virus was dated around 1800 CE [85]. A study that separately accounted for the rate of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions estimated HCV to have originated at least 2000 years ago [89]. Recently, a method based on an a selection-informed model was used to estimate the divergence time of HCV genotypes and the origin of extant EHV/CHV strains [70]. This approach, provided estimates of \u223c3000 years ago for the TMRCA of extant HCV genotypes (with a low-bound estimate of \u223c5000 years before present) and of \u223c800 years ago for EHV/CHV [70]. If these dates are taken to provide at least an indication of the real evolutionary scenario, the possibility that HCV was transmitted to humans by horses infected with EHV can be excluded, an observation in line with the low diversity of EHV/CHV [82]. The origin of EHV/CHV as reverse zoonosis (i.e., the transmission of a human virus to animals) seems also unlikely, as in this case horse viruses should cluster within HCV diversity, unless the HCV lineage that originated EHV went extinct in the last 800 years. Indeed, as the HBV story exemplifies, viral lineage extinction can occur and was previously documented for other human pathogens such as parvovirus B19 [90], and variola virus [91]. As anticipated above, breeding practices may facilitate this process in the case of animal viruses. We know, for instance, that a minimum of two horse lineages went extinct during the domestication process and that horse genetic diversity has largely been shaped by events that occurred in the last few centuries [92]. It is thus possible that human-mediated selection on the host also resulted in the artificial selection of viral lineages. This would explain the relatively recent origin of extant EHV strains and their low diversity. If viral lineage extinction did occur, the time frames of EHV and HCV evolution would be underestimated and the scenario of HCV originating as a zoonosis from horses (or EHV as a reverse zoonosis) may still hold (Fig. 3C). Of course, the alternative possibility that EHV and HCV were transmitted independently to their present-day hosts by a third unknown reservoir is also in line with data on extant diversity and, if the transmission to horses occurred recently, does not require to postulate viral lineage extinction. Thus, a number of open questions remain on the origin of HCV. Hopefully, technological advances that allow sequencing of trace genetic material from ancient samples will provide information on viral strains hosted by humans and horses back in the past. At the same time, the extensive application of metagenomic approaches to different animal hosts across diverse geographic regions will expand our knowledge on hepacivirus diversity and eventually uncover the direct ancestor of HCV (if it still exists). Indeed, the possibility that the different HCV genotypes derived from independent cross-species transmission events [85] would imply that viruses related to HCV are relatively common in the wild, thus giving good chances to be recovered in large field surveys.",

The evolutionary origin of HDV is nonetheless unknown. HDV-like circular RNAs were only recently described in birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects [98], [99], [100]. However, these HDV-like elements were not found to be associated with hepadnavirus infection, reinforcing the idea the HDV is not necessarily only transmitted in conjunction with HBV-related viruses, at least in these animals [100].

Orthohepeviruses A account for a minority of the overall diversity of hepeviruses that infect vertebrates and their closest relative is a presently unclassified virus detected in a Swedish moose (Fig. 4A) [109]. Field surveys revealed a high prevalence of HEV in moose populations from Sweden and other Baltic Regions [110], [111]. In general, ungulates represent major Orthohepeviruses A reservoirs. At present, eight Orthohepevirus A genotypes are recognized (HEV-1 to -8) (Fig. 4A). HEV-1 and HEV-2 infect only humans and cause waterborne outbreaks mainly in tropical and subtropical regions (Fig. 4B). Conversely, genotypes 3 and 4 account for the majority of hepatitis E human cases in industrialized countries. HEV-3 and HEV-4 also infect several other domestic (mainly pigs) and wild (e.g., ungulates and small carnivores) animals, their transmission to humans being usually zoonotic [2] (Fig. 4A). Phylogenetic analyses showed that HEV-3 and HEV-4 sequences derived from human cases are interspersed within those isolated from swine, indicating that pig-infecting HEV-3 and HEV-4 can easily cross the species barrier and infect humans [112]. Notably, though, evolutionary rates are higher for genotypes 3 and 4 than for the human-specific genotypes, suggesting cyclical adaptation to different mammalian hosts [113]. A distinct HEV-3 clade, mainly detected in rabbits (HEV-3ra), can also cause human hepatitis E [114], [115], [116], [117] (Fig. 4A). The remaining genotypes HEV-5/HEV-6 and HEV-7/HEV-8 have been detected in boars and camels, respectively [2] (Fig. 4A). However, they are also thought to have zoonotic potential, as HEV-5 and HEV-7 can infect cynomolgus monkeys [118], [119] and HEV-7 was detected in a patient who consumed camel meat and milk [120]. Thus, viruses belonging to all HEV genotypes seem to be transmissible to humans. Conversely, experimental infection with HEV-1 and HEV-2 indicated that these viruses have a host range restricted to primates [2]. HEV genotypes are therefore usually referred to as enzootic (HEV-3 and \u22124) or human-restricted/anthropotropic (HEV-1 and -2).",

In fact, character state reconstruction on a large phylogeny revealed that humans were the most likely hosts of the ancestor of extant orthohepeviruses A [121]. This notion is in line with the observation that most, if not all, HEV genotypes can infect our species, whereas other animals are differentially susceptible to distinct HEV genotypes. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that reverse zoonotic events (also known as zooanthroponoses) are all but rare, and examples include other RNA viruses such as rotaviruses, enteroviruses, and human influenza viruses [122], [123], [124], [125]. For both swine influenza A viruses and swine vesicular disease virus onward transmission in pigs is well documented [123], [125] and is facilitated by intensive husbandry practices.",

These inferences well correlate with historical circumstances that may have favored HEV emergence and host range expansion. In this period, sedentary agriculture promoted the appearance of large human settlements in several Asian regions and pig husbandry practices started to intensify in East Asia [126], [127], [128], [129], [130] (Fig. 4C). Crowded living conditions and poor sanitation possibly favored the emergence and spread of the waterborne, human-specific HEV strains. The close contact between humans and pigs most likely promoted HEV zooanthroponotic transmission and emergence of the enzootic strains (Fig. 4C). Additional reverse zoonotic transmissions may have also originated the camel-infecting and rabbit-infecting strains. In fact, the estimated timing of HEV-7/8 emergence (4055 BCE to 1192 BCE) [121] encompasses the time of domestication of Bactrian and dromedary camels [131], [132], [133] (Fig. 4C). As for HEV-3ra, it was estimated to have diverged from HEV-3 around 600 CE, in Europe [121]. This time frame corresponds to the Middle Ages, when historical evidence indicates that rabbits were kept in warrens and bred for meat [134] (Fig. 4C). Of course, these estimates do not necessarily imply that camels and rabbits acquired HEV from humans, as the domestication process may have exposed these animals to various viral sources, including other domestic (e.g., pigs) and peridomestic mammals.",

Likewise, the origin and evolutionary relationship between the moose virus and human-infecting orthohepeviruses remain unclear.",

These insights have been paralleled by the development of computational tools and theoretical frameworks to analyze and mine viral sequence data (e.g., the above-mentioned recognition of the TDRP and the development of approaches to correct for it). The overall picture emerging from these studies clearly indicates that, with the possible exception of HDV, viruses related to human hepatitis viruses infect several other mammalian and non mammalian vertebrates. The specific events that originated these human pathogens remain, however, largely unknown. For HCV and HEV, the evolutionary history of the human viruses is likely intertwined with that of related viruses that infect domestic animals. Conversely, in the case of HAV and HBV, the closest relatives of the human viruses are found in NHPs. In general, these observations indicate that a deeper understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of human viruses has a relevance not only to improve our ability to treat and prevent present infections, but also to gain insight into the ecological contexts that may fuel the emergence of novel human pathogens, with particular reference to zoonotic ones.",
