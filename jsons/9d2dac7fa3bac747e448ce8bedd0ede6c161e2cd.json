Disasters such as Katrina (2005), Hurricane Sandy (2012), Alberta (Canada) Floods (2013), and Super Typhoon Haiyan (2013) are examples that highlight the vulnerability of communities to natural hazards and the crippling effect they have on the social and economic well-being. Through foresight and scenario planning, such events can be expected but can they be predicted to support resilience and enable suppression of the impacts? With consideration of emerging and systemic risks and inherent uncertainty associated with surprising events, planning for and managing risk, crisis and disasters requires understanding of the outliers that challenge our resilience.",

            "text": "Typhoon Haiyan (2013) devastated portions of south-east Asia and was one of the most intense storms ever documented. The Great East Japan Earthquake (2011) was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded to have hit Japan. The earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that reached heights of up to 40.5 m. The earthquake and tsunami caused extensive and severe structural damage to north-eastern Japan and resulted in the meltdown of three nuclear reactors. These events and others such as Hurricane Katrina (2005) , Blackout Canada-US (2003) , Hurricane Sandy (2012), Alberta (Canada) floods (2013), Heartbleed cyber incursion (2014) and global terrorist actions highlight the vulnerability of social and critical infrastructures to natural hazards, natural hazard triggered technological disasters (NATECHs) and man-made disasters and the crippling effect that such events can have regionally, nationally and globally on social and economic well-being ). This networked risk landscape is one characterised by hyper-risks (Helbing 2013) and hybrid risks . As noted in Weick and Sutcliffe (Weick and Sutcliffe 2007), 'Unexpected events often audit our resilience' and thereby challenge response and recovery activities. With our hyper-connected world, the impact of unexpected events such as floods, earthquakes, financial crises, and cyber-attacks has revealed the fragility and vulnerabilities that lie within the social/technological/economic/political/ecological interdependent systems . In particular, events that impact physical and digital critical infrastructure such as damage to electric power, telecommunications, transportation and water-supply systems can ripple across local, regional and global regions. There exists a rich body of knowledge regarding the statistics associated with the occurrence of such outlier events. Taleb (2007) calls these extreme events 'Black Swans' to describe their inherent quality of surprise, sometimes viewed as an 'Act of God'. The question arises: can we predict the occurrence of some Black Swans' (extreme events)? As described by Johnson and Tivnan (2012) '\u2026 understanding, controlling and predicting extreme behavior is an important strategic goal to support resilience planning'. As noted by Sornette (2009) . \u2026extreme events should be considered to be rather frequent and to result from the same organization principle(s) as those generating other events: because they belong to the same statistical distribution, this suggests common generating mechanism(s).",

Moreover, nascent efforts have been made to apply to complex network theory to obtaining a deeper fundamental understanding of the collective responses of human populations to large-scale emergencies such as bombings, plane crashes, earthquakes, and power outages (blackouts) (Bagrow et al. 2011) with important implications for improvements in emergency detection and response. Finally, very recent efforts on the application of control theory to complex networks (Liu et al. 2011 ) has been initiated, and this seminal effort is expected to have a potential long-term impact for the improvement of the robustness of technological and infrastructure networks against failures and attacks.",

What emerges from the discussion is the association of Dragon-Kings with such dynamics as '\u2026 a phase transition, a bifurcation, a catastrophe, or a tipping point' (Sornette 2009 ). Hence, Sornette (2009) argues that the presence of a phase transition provides foresight 'weak-signals' pertaining to the occurrence of Dragon-Kings. What this suggests from a disaster risk reduction perspective, is that through modeling efforts, extreme events (Dragon Kings) '\u2026 can exhibit a degree of predictability' (Johnson and Tivnan 2012) thereby supporting planning and mitigation of risks. In essence, it is argued that through M&S we can proactively examine conditions of vulnerability to decrease the likelihood and/or impact of extreme events (dragon-kings) through scenario analysis. This is essentially a 'flight simulator' framework to test drive and explore different scenarios to facilitate decision making.",

The dependencies of the various components of a network on each other only become clear when failures (catastrophes) occur in the network such as the rapid spreading of a computer virus over the Internet, the collapse of a global financial system, or the large-scale breakdown of an electrical power grid. Yet, researchers (Barabasi 2003; Caldarelli 2007; Newman et al. 2006 ) are discovering general concepts and properties that appear to be intrinsic to the various diverse complex networks, leading to the intriguing concept that there may be a few fundamental organizing principles that determine the topological characteristics and ultimately the behavior of complex networks. In other words, there may be a set of basic universal rules (generic organising principles) that would allow one to predict the emergent behavior in a complex network (despite the seemingly intractability of this enormous task) which according to Barabasi (2005) would allow one '\u2026 to understand the key to nature's code for multitasking-the one that orchestrates the actions of uncountable components into a magic dance of order and ultimate elegance'.",

It was reported that \"\u2026 ten days before Calgary was inundated last summer, supercomputers half a world away were spitting out predictions that showed the city would soon be flooded\" (McClure 2014).",

Such extreme events cannot be inferred from the properties of their parts; hence local events can have far-reaching consequences that are often difficult to anticipate. The question is posed by Sornette and Ouillon (2012) as to how much the understanding obtained on dragon-kings could lead to operational utility. To this, Janczura and Weron (2012) find such a notion controversial, but nonetheless do not outright discount it, but rather call for more research. Sornette and Ouillon (2012) describe the value of modeling and simulation to explore this regime of complexity, and particularly to support decision making. Their analysis of this domain highlight that failures such as Deepwater Horizon Oil spill Wattie and Masys 2014) and subprime crisis, exhibit common patterns including: 'lack or decreasing questioning of assumptions over time; insufficient prior analysis; failure to anticipate side effects; incorrect interpretation of the system's reaction (no immediate obvious negative effect wrongly interpreted as \"all is well\")' (Sornette and Ouillon 2012) . This resonates with such Natural Disaster Triggered Technological Accidents as the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (Ray-Bennett et al. 2015) , as well as humanitarian crisis (Masys 2013) and violent extremism and radicalization (Masys 2014b) . In these analysis and simulations, complex interdependencies and nonlinearity characterize the problem space. Weak signal detection emerges as requirement to facilitate management of such disasters. Suveges and Davison (2012) present an example of a catastrophic event (extreme rainfall) that was apparently impossible from scientific extrapolation or common sense based on the past. In effect, disaster risk reduction through modeling and simulation support planning for and mitigating these types of extreme events. Sornette and Ouillon (2012) are adamant that the cost is too large to learn from real-life crises. They argue that '\u2026 it is possible to develop simulators for decision makers to understand the complex dynamics of out-of-equilibrium systems whose behavior intrinsically includes changes of regimes, bifurcations, tipping points and their associated dragon kings'. The decision maker thus first needs to understand the dynamics of his system holistically, in a systemic way, which means that he needs to understand the existence of dragon-kings as one of the dynamical solutions of the evolution of his system. He needs to have a classification of the different regimes possible, a phase diagram in which he understands which control leads to the region of the dragon-kings and which do not. He needs to understand that bifurcations and changes of regime are a natural and expected part of natural and social systems (Sornette and Ouillon 2012) .",

For example, some initial seminal work (Liu et al. 2011) has already been conducted to determine the degree of controllability of some real networks. This effort can potentially lead to the development of a tool box that can be applied to the control of arbitrary complex networks, providing a framework to increase the robustness of a network to failures or to an attack (viz., to better resist random or intentional attacks). Finally, new avenues involving novel concepts of multiscale connectivity within networks (Dodds et al. 2002) have been shown to possess the characteristic of ultra-robustness by simultaneously minimizing the likelihood of failure (i.e., avoiding the failure) in the network as well as the effect of the failure if and when this occurs (i.e., minimizing any further loss from the failure if it should occur). Ultra-robustness is a key determinant in the characterization of a complex network with respect to catastrophe recovery whether from a failure or from an attack. Another interesting application of complex network theory is to the prediction of human mobility (Song et al. 2010 ) and, more specifically, to the deeper understanding of the role and impact of human dynamics and activity patterns in emergency detection and response (Bagrow et al. 2011).
