Our initiative is organized in various work packages that include; access to reliable diagnostic tests and use of digital solutions to manage and to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic. We are facilitating this initiative while working across various academic disciplines, industries, consultants, HTA organizations and governments, for the greater good ( Figure 1 ). Even though the project has a European focus in this initial phase, the results are of relevance for a broader audience in other regions around the world.",

This may likely jeopardize the regulated processes that ensure efficiency, safety, equitable access and effectiveness of new drugs and technology. In the current stage of the pandemic, it is crucial to control the spread of the COVID-19 and to optimize management and treatment of affected patients where a large proportion of those infected having mild symptoms which can be effectively managed at home. Thus, disease management tools (DMT) are crucial, and the impact of a DMT will depend on both the individual and organizational responses.",

            "text": "From our on-going review of national methodologies by HTA's to evaluate DHS in Europe, we were only able to find a few dedicated methodologies to demonstrate the value and effectiveness of digital health technologies (DHT) to guide developers and decision makers, where the \"Evidence standards framework for digital health technologies\" (2) by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom is the most developed . For the DHS and DHT, the traditional HTA frameworks which focus on a specific clinical pathway are not enough. This is because other aspects such as, acceptance by the user, IT-security, scalability, and the ability to demonstrate effectiveness in a specific context become more relevant. The standard also identifies specific aspects regarding IT-security, to ensure a safe function, which is assumed to be covered within the European CE-marking approval processa prerequisite before a technology is placed on the market. One of the substantial limitations of the current Medical Device Directive (3), include allowing many types of DHS to be placed on the market without any review by an external body. This raises potential risks and concerns which should be evaluated prior to deployment of such solutions. The EUnetHTA makes an important distinction regarding diagnostics in their HTA-core model for evaluation of diagnostic tests (4). They highlight the need to understand the role of a technology in the entire healthcare pathway. They also provide guidance in evaluating what type of regulatory approval the product has. However, they do not include validity consideration. In our recent webinar (5) experts reviewed the extent of validity of the CE-mark in ensuring safe and effective tests in a broader perspective. Similar to the DHS, professional diagnostic tools, under the current Invitro Diagnostic Directive, do not require the evaluation of an external party before they can be CE-marked and placed on the market (6) . Even though the WHO Director General has a simple message to all countries \"test, test, test\" (7), the expert group identified the importance of developing guidance based on evidence, intention and specific performance requirements. In fact, a proper evaluation of a diagnostic test in this category -according to the new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (8), would require a review of an external notified body and a European expert panel, which may take up to a year. Yet, in the current situation we are experiencing use of products, whose development may have lasted for at most two or three months. For example, in Spain the government had acquired test kits with an \"accurate detection rate of just 30%.\" (9) . In Sweden the Medical Product Agency has prohibited the use of two selfadministered tests for COVID-19 (10) which had not been reviewed by a notified body.",
