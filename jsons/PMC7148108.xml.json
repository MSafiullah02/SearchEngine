Automated systems for claim identification and verification can be very useful as supportive technology for investigative journalism, as they could provide help and guidance, thus saving time [14, 22, 24, 33]. A system could automatically identify check-worthy claims, make sure they have not been fact-checked already by a reputable fact-checking organization, and then present them to a journalist for further analysis in a ranked list. Additionally, the system could identify documents that are potentially useful for humans to perform manual fact-checking of a claim, and it could also estimate a veracity score supported by evidence to increase the journalist\u2019s understanding and the trust in the system\u2019s decision.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first shared task that addresses all steps of the fact-checking process. Moreover, unlike previous editions of the CheckThat! Lab, our main focus here is on social media, which are the center of \u201cfake news\u201d and disinformation. We further feature a more realistic information retrieval scenario with pooling for evaluation, as done at IR venues such as TREC. Last but not least, in-line with the general mission of CLEF, we promote multi-linguality by offering our tasks in different languages.",
