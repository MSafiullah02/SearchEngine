Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum), constitutes a serious health problem in various regions of the Mediterranean and the Americas [1]. Since dogs are the most important domestic reservoirs of L. (L.) chagasi\n[2] within Latin America and Europe, the natural history of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) has been studied extensively with respect to parasite load in different tissues and immunopathological changes relating to the progression of clinical forms [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Whilst such data have proven to be valuable in the development of tools employed in the evaluation of chemotherapies and vaccines against CVL, current treatment strategies have failed to achieve a consistent parasitological cure for the disease owing to the presence of latently infected cells [9], [10]. In this respect, a canine vaccine may represent the most practical and effective method by which to reduce the incidence of human VL, and it could also provide a basis for the development of a similar vaccine for humans [11], [12], [13].",

            "text": "In the search for a potential vaccine against CVL, various approaches involving the dog model have been employed, and the use of purified fractions from parasite extracts (e.g. fucose mannose ligand [FML] antigen) [14], [15] and from parasite cultures (excreted/secreted antigens) [16], [17] have shown particular promise. Additionally, some remarkable results have been obtained following vaccination of dogs with killed parasite vaccines [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], thus demonstrating that vaccines prepared from antigenic extracts still remain a reliable proposition in consideration of their cost, safety and broad spectrum of antigenicity. In this context, we have recently demonstrated that killed Leishmania braziliensis, together with saponin (LBSap vaccine; Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Intelectual\u2014patent PI 0601225-6, 17 February 2006), or with saponin and saliva of Lutzomyia longipalpis (LBSapSal vaccine), generates very high levels of immunogenicity in dogs. Vaccinated animals exhibited increased numbers of circulating T-cells (CD5+, CD4+ and CD8+), B-cells (CD21+) and L. chagasi-specific CD8+ T-cells [21], [22], representing the key resistance profile against CVL [6]. Moreover, animals that had received saponin as adjuvant presented only minor local swelling as the major adverse reaction, indicating that in dogs, overall tolerance to the candidate vaccine appears to be adequate [21], [22]. However, further studies are still required to overcome potential problems in this area by searching for additional safety biomarkers associated with the use of saponin as vaccine adjuvant.",

Histopathological examination showed that within the Sap and LBSap groups, animals presented oedema, congestion, haemorrhage and degeneration of the muscle fibres in the inoculated areas, together with signs of significant focal inflammation. Such alterations were observed particularly in the early period (1 h) following inoculation (Fig. 1D and G) and continued until the late period (up to 96 h) (Fig. 1F and I). Sap and LBSap inoculums induced a pronounced inflammatory reaction in the dermis and hypodermis of the study animals, and this was positively correlated with iNOS expression (Fig. 2\n, upper and lower right panels).",

Numerous anti-CVL vaccines containing diverse antigens and adjuvants have been tested in Brazil, and some have shown promising results [14], [18], [21], [22], [23], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. In our continuing effort to develop a vaccine against CVL that is both efficient and safe, we have conducted studies on two new preparations, namely, LBSap and LBSapSal. The results obtained so far have revealed that these vaccines possess strong immunogenic capacities and can induce high levels of anti-Leishmania IgG (IgG1 and IgG2) as well as lymphocytes, particularly T CD8+ (circulating and in vitro L. chagasi-specific) cells. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that these vaccines induce an immune response that is compatible with the control of the etiological agent of CVL, i.e. intense proliferative activity of L. chagasi-specific lymphocytes and increased production of NO during in vitro stimulation by soluble L. chagasi antigens [21], [22].",

Giunchetti et al.

In this context, moderate to intense inflammatory reactions, with oedemas lasting from 2 to 3 days, have been reported in sheep following subcutaneous inoculation with 1 mg of saponin [42]. Additionally, we observed discreet alterations in the skin of the LB animals at 12 and 24 h after inoculation, and these could have been induced by the inoculation itself together with increased vascular permeability.

This finding reinforces the assumption that saponin modulates the immune response by stimulating antibody production and non-specific reactions, such as inflammation, and cell traffic [41], [43]. The numbers of cells observed in the hypodermis of Sap and LBSap animals were larger than in the dermis, probably by virtue of the more extensive vascularisation in the former layer. As demonstrated in the present study, the inflammatory infiltrate increased within the Sap and LBSap groups at 12, 24 and 48 h compared with the S and LB groups, and also in the Sap group at 1 and 96 h compared with the S group.

            "text": "Within the Sap and LBSap groups, increases in the numbers of neutrophils and lymphocytes and decreases in the numbers of macrophages were observed at various times during the study period. In the late period following inoculation, there were increases in the numbers of eosinophils in the inner dermis and hypodermis of Sap animals, and in the inner and outer dermis of LBSap animals. Based on these results it is possible to hypothesise that neutrophils function at the front line of the immune system, responding immediately upon request, and direct the migration of other cells to the inoculation area some hours afterwards. It appears, therefore, that neutrophils participate effectively in the adaptive immune response from the very beginning of the process. This assumption is supported by several studies in which the role of neutrophils has been considered [44], [45]. According to Appelberg [44], neutrophils not only act as phagocytes but also determine the inflammatory immune response and cooperate with other cells in the amplification of such response. Moreover, neutrophils play a role in acquired (or adaptive) immunity since they are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that can activate na\u00efve T lymphocytes [45]. In this context, neutrophils have been shown to migrate to the infection site before macrophages and dendritic cells, and are the first cells to interact with CD8+ T lymphocytes [44]. Moreover, together with saponin [41], the neutrophils stimulate the activation of T CD8+ lymphocytes, hence contributing to the entire immunogenic process. Some reports have suggested that neutrophils operate not only in an indirect manner as APCs, but are also instrumental in the recruitment of other cells (i.e. T lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages and immature dendritic cells) through the production of chemokines [46].",

The co-participation of cells associated with the adaptive response in the activation of the innate response has recently been discussed by Berg and Forman [48]. According to those authors, the migration of CD8+ T lymphocytes represents an additional mechanism since the cells produce IFN-\u03b3 via the interaction with IL-12 and IL-18 cytokines, independent of the T-cell receptor-major histocompatability complex (TCR-MHC) mechanism, and destroy infected cells hence controlling the multiplication of the infectious agent and mediating the initial stages of the acquired immune response [48]. The presence of CD4+ T lymphocytes is also important since these cells produce IFN-\u03b3 and activate macrophages, thus increasing the microbicide capability and the production of cytokines that take part in the adaptive response and control of Leishmania infection [49].",

It is known that iNOS expression is a key factor in the immune adaptive response to external stimuli and virulent pathogens [50], [51], and that NO is particularly important in the control of Leishmania parasites [52]. Semi-quantitative analysis demonstrated that iNOS was expressed in the skin layers of all animal groups including those of the control group S. This finding leads us to believe that all stimuli have the capacity to increase iNOS expression, contributing to the production of NO and participating in a broad range of processes ranging from non-specific reactions to the modulation of the immune system [53].",

This observation can be explained by the presence of a higher number of macrophages, cells that are considered to be important NO producers, recruited to the outer dermis during this period in response to the LB inoculum. In contrast, the Sap and LBSap groups showed larger areas of iNOS expression at 12 h onwards in comparison with the other groups. The increased iNOS expression in these groups may be explained by the great number of NO-producing cells recruited to the inoculation area, activation of which would contribute to the eradication of the parasite. The correlation between the number of nuclei and iNOS expression in the dermis and hypodermis of animals of the Sap and LBSap groups confirms these assumptions.",

In the present study it was shown that in the outer dermis of LB animals, the percentage of macrophages was positively correlated with the area of iNOS expression suggesting that the LB inoculum activated NO-producing macrophages. In addition, within the Sap group there was a positive correlation between the number of cell nuclei and eosinophils present in the inner dermis, suggesting that these cells contribute to the innate response induced by the strong adjuvant power of saponin.",

The high levels of NO observed in the groups inoculated with saponin may be related to the high levels of type 1 cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1) [59] that are essential for the activation of effector mechanisms such as the production of NO for the control of Leishmania parasites.",
