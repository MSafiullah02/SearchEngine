HPIVs can cause a range of upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses including bronchitis, bronchiolitis, laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), and pneumonia [2]. HPIVs are the second most common cause of acute respiratory illness-related hospitalizations in children < 5 years of age, second only to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). HPIVs account for approximately 7 % of all hospitalizations for fever, acute respiratory illness (ARI), or both [3]. Co-infections of HPIV and other respiratory viruses are common and may lead to more complicated and prolonged disease course, especially among children [1,3].",

Infants, young children, the elderly, and those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk for severe HPIV illness. In healthy adults, HPIV illness is usually limited to mild upper respiratory track symptoms [6].",

HPIV-4 seasonal patterns are less well\u2013described; the few studies that assessed HPIV-4 focused on solitary outbreaks of HPIV-4 or were limited to countries outside the United States [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. Available studies that have documented patterns of HPIV-4 circulation have reported conflicting findings, suggesting that HPIV-4 peaks either in the fall of odd-numbered years or annually following HPIV-3 peaks [6,7]. However, these studies reflect regional or local circulation and are not necessarily representative of national HPIV-4 circulation patterns.",

For NREVSS, laboratories report on a weekly basis the aggregated total number of tests performed and the number of positive tests determined in the previous week by either of three categories of detection methods; molecular diagnostic assays, virus antigen detection, and viral isolation by culture. The diagnostic method reported from each laboratory varies by surveillance year and by virus. The NREVSS surveillance year begins in July and ends in June of the following year in order to first capture the onset followed by the offset of most respiratory viruses within a 12-month period.

Overall, HPIV testing increased substantially each year (Supplemental Fig. 1). From July 2011 to June 2012, 100,971 HPIV tests were reported to NREVSS, increasing to 536,527 HPIV tests during July 2017- June 2019. The seasonal distribution and annual prevalence of HPIV by type varied considerably. HPIV-1 rose mainly in the summer and peaked in the fall of odd numbered years (2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017) and declined in the spring of the following year. In contrast, HPIV-2 peaked in the fall of even numbered years (2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018), declining in the spring of the following year. HPIV-3 peaked annually in summer months and declined in the fall of the same reporting year. During 2012 and 2016, smaller HPIV-3 peaks were also observed during fall months. HPIV-4 was most commonly seen during the fall, peaking in winter of each year (Fig. 1\n). Each geographic region had a similar distribution of HPIV detections and seasonal patterns to what was observed nationally (Fig. 2\n).",

As a result, certain laboratories or regions of the US may be overrepresented or underrepresented in the analysis. NREVSS cannot be used to determine prevalence or incidence of infection because reports represent virus detections but not the number of patients testing positive. PHLIP data represent a subset of NREVSS data, limiting our assessment of age and gender of HPIV detections. Molecular panel tests, which contain HPIV, are more frequently ordered among children than adults in NREVSS, which may have affected the age distribution [22]. Additionally, these data include only a limited pool of clinical and sociodemographic factors including information on comorbidities, racial/ethnic background, or clinical course of infection, which limited the ascertainment of clinical associations among the HPIV types. Future studies should explore these other factors. Lastly, while HPIV testing increased over time, this increase may not be representative of viral activity, but a result of increased availability of multiplex molecular panels which contain HPIV targets. Despite these limitations, data collected through NREVSS provides a comprehensive understanding of HPIV trends in the US. The extensive laboratory network routinely reporting to NREVSS allows us to identify circulation patterns and monitor year-to-year changes in HPIV types, including HPIV-4.",
