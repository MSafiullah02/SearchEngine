They were, notably, Ross Harrison, Peyton Rous and John Enders. It evolved out of practical advances in cell biology such as the use of trypsin to disperse cells from solid tissue and the creation of continuous and semi-continuous cell lines; also out of the availability of antibiotics to maintain culture sterility. Virus isolation technique was then refined by the development of methods for recognising occult viral replication on monolayers, aided by skills acquired in passaging and maintaining the cultures long term. Consequently, within 10 years of the publication of the classic paper reproduced below, most of the readily cultivable animal viruses had been isolated and adapted to growth in cell culture. Since then the polymerase chain reaction has emerged as a rival viral diagnostic technique, but it lacks the openended potential of monolayer culture as a means of virus detection. Future diagnostic practice will more likely see these two techniques being used in conjunction to achieve even faster and more sensitive virus isolation and identification.",

At a stroke, it also relieved the log jam in the diagnosis, epidemiological understanding and vaccinology of poliomyelitis. For this the authors were awarded a Nobel prize. Other contributions, before and after, were essential for bringing the in vitro culture of viruses within reach of even the humblest laboratory facility, and it is upon these that, following the text of Enders et al, I concentrate my discussion. This is not meant to detract from the classic paper, only to set it in its wider context. CULTIVATION (2, 5) . The evidence that this may occur is almost entirely indirect, although recent data indicate that Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis virus as well as various mouse pathogenic poliomyelitis-like viruses of uncertain origin may multiply in nonnervous tissue (1, 3) . Direct attempts by Sabin and Olitsky (4) to demonstrate in vitro multiplication of a monkey-adapted strain of poliomyelitis virus (MV strain) in cultures composed of certain nonnervous tissues failed. They obtained, however, an increase in the agent in fragments of human embryonic brain. The general recognition that the virus may be present in the intestinal tract of patients with poliomyelitis and of persons in contact with them emphasizes the desirability of further investigation of the possibility of extra-neural multiplication. Accordingly, experiments with tissue cultures were undertaken to determine whether the Lansing strain of poliomyelitis virus could be propagated in three types of human embryonic tissues. The results are summarized here in a preliminary manner.",

During this interval, in addition to the original set, three successive subcultures have been made to fresh tissue and the fluids have been removed and replaced 10 times ( Table 1 ). Assuming that at each change of fluid a dilution of approximately 1:15 was effected and that at the initiation of each set of cultures the inoculum was diluted 30 times, it has been calculated that the 10% suspension of infected mouse brain used as the primary inoculum had been diluted approximately 10 17 times in the fluids removed from the third subculture on the 16th day of cultivation. These fluids, however, on inoculation into mice and monkeys, produced typical paralysis. Accordingly, since the mouse LD 50 of the original inoculum was 10 \u00c02 , it would appear that the increase in virus during the course of the experiment was at least of the order of 10 15 times. During the 67-day period of cultivation a progressive decrease in mouse infectivity was recorded (Table 1) . On the other hand, in the second experiment, mentioned above, the calculated increase in virus during a 52-day period is now of the order of 10 16 times and no decrease in mouse infectivity has so far been observed.",

The reasons were several, and foremost was the belief that viruses would only grow in the cells, and even only the relevant organ, of their target species. Alexis Carrel wrote in 1928 that 'tissues must originate from an animal susceptible to the disease of which the causal agent is being studied' [11] and his view held sway for 20 years. Thus the idea that poliovirus would only grow in primate brain, a tissue not readily cultured in vitro, led to polio studies getting bogged down in costly and inconvenient animal work, entirely in monkeys until 1937 when Armstrong adapted type 2 poliovirus to mouse brain [12] . By then, however, as Enders wisely observed, 'it was becoming increasingly difficult to visualise the nervous system as the site of manufacture of the enormous quantities of virus . . . found in the faeces of many patients' [13] . Enders, Robbins and Wellers' classic 1949 paper finally dispelled the idea of a narrow organotropism.",

In some cases (influenza, yellow fever and pox viruses) egg culture was highly successful, but perhaps this was at the expense of a more timely adoption of in vitro cell culture. Though Carrel, a pioneer of tissue culture as applied to virology, had suggested as early as 1928 that 'a chick embryo crushed to a fine pulp is capable of producing as much smallpox vaccine as a calf [11] , few could emulate his skill at that technique.

These effects became visible by low power microscopy, usually between 24 and 120 hours later, and they were sometimes recognisably typical for a virus genus. The rapidity of the virus induced changes, whether in the pH of the medium or a focal or general shrinkage and destruction of cells, depended partly on the size of the inoculum but mostly on the growth characteristics of the inoculated virus. Polioviruses, for example, rapidly destroyed cells, but some other viruses needed prolonged incubation of the monolayers, or one or more passages onto fresh monolayers, before a CPE was discernable. The appearance of giant cells and syncytia was sometimes a pointer to what the virus isolate might be, as was the ability to make the infected cells bind mammalian or avian red cells, or release a haemagglutinin detectable as a reaction between the culture fluid and the same range of red cells [25] . For more rapid diagnosis, cell sheets could be disrupted before the CPE was allowed to advance. The cell suspension was then clarified and the virus isolate pelleted from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation for diagnosis by electron microscopy. CPEs might be neutralised by the addition of convalescent or immune human or animal sera, allowing the development of identification tests for an infecting virus as well as, by reversal of the procedure, detection of serum antibodies to it [26] . With suitable controls, normally pre-and post-infection human or animal sera, a range of diagnostic possibilities opened up that involved only limited use of experimental animals and was faster and cheaper than alternative laboratory tests, in so far as any existed. The virologist could at last rival the bacteriologist in giving a timely diagnostic opinion. As a consequence new departments and chairs of virology began to be funded, at a rate and on a scale that it has not always been possible to sustain.",

Some primary and continuous cell lines harboured unwanted viruses, both ones that caused a gross CPE such as 'foamy agent' and other cryptic simian viruses that could nevertheless interfere with diagnostic procedures [28] . Sometimes adventitious viruses were introduced with the animal serum used in cell growth media, and these infections were often occult, too. For example, calf serum was shown to be the source of a bovine polyoma virus found by electron microscopy to be a passenger in a continuous line of monkey kidney cells [29] . Many cell lines also became contaminated with mycoplasmata [30] . Nevertheless, virus isolation and neutralising serological tests were established as routine diagnostic investigations, and this greatly contributed to the demystification of viruses as agents of disease. Clinicians who saw febrile patients and epidemiologists who investigated outbreaks could often be told what the infecting virus was. Also the expansion of virus discovery sparked an interest in virus taxonomy which shows no sign of abating [31] .",

            "text": "Nothing further happened in viral diagnostics to rival the introduction of monolayer culture until, in 1983, Kerry Mullis discovered how virus genomes could be amplified directly from specimens with suitable DNA primers. His polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been of particular value in the study of hard-to-grow agents such as the hepatitis and gastroenteritis viruses, as well as the human immunodeficiency virus. Limitations on the availability of some tissues, disinclination to maintain a full range of cell cultures, safety considerations and other more dubious rationalisations have since led to the view in some quarters that PCR and other gene amplification methods will supersede monolayer culture; but this notion is misguided. In particular, cell culture allows genomically uncertain viruses to be discovered, propagated and characterised. For instance, while it was possible to identify the SARS coronavirus using PCR, the virus also turned out to grow with alarming ease in Vero and other cells. Hybrid approaches involving the initial inoculation of monolayers followed after a few hours by PCR have recently been described. These may heighten the sensitivity and increase the speed of viral diagnosis.",

The published record of their work stands and their names still resonate in virological circles. They described cell culture procedures which several generations of laboratory technologists have since used, lately often in ignorance of their derivation. Anyone tempted to belittle these pioneers' contributions should read the descriptions of the painstaking tissue culture procedures that monolayer cell culture superseded, not to mention the animal work of a yet earlier era which it would now be very contentious to have to rely on. Monolayer cell culture established virology as an independent academic discipline, and while Enders and colleagues' classic paper was only one step on the way it had a lasting impact on diagnostic medicine. It is a sign of the fundamental importance of the technique of cell culture of viruses that it is now taken for granted!",
