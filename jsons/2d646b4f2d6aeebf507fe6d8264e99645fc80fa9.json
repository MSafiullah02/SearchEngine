Using data obtained outside an episodic clinical setting is the first step towards building a continuous health estimation system. In this paper, we explore a system that allows users to combine events and data streams from different sources and retrieve complex biological events, such as cardiovascular volume overload, using measured lifestyle events. These complex events, which have been explored in biomedical literature and which we call interface events, have a direct causal impact on the relevant biological systems; they are the interface through which the lifestyle events influence our health. We retrieve the interface events from existing events and data streams by encoding domain knowledge using the event operator language. The interface events can then be utilized to provide a continuous estimate of the biological variables relevant to the user's health state. The event-based framework also makes it easier to estimate which event is causally responsible for a particular change in the individual's health state.",

ICMR '20, June 8-11, 2020 worked for infectious diseases, where the cause of the ailment was an external agent, it does not work as well for chronic diseases where the cause may be events in daily life that have persisted for years. These events slowly change people's health to an irreversible state, without symptomatic warning. The most widely spread disease burden in the world is cardiovascular disease, and factors that change our cardiovascular health state act without any perceivable signals [30] [8] . While there are tests available to measure a person's risk for chronic diseases, they are usually performed episodically and only in a clinical setting. In the example of cardiovascular disease, the invasive test of choice would be an angiogram [44] . Since these tests are so invasive, they cannot be performed frequently enough to have a constant understanding of the health of an individual. This highlights the need for using unobtrusively collected lifestyle data for estimating individual health parameters [35] .",

These sensors are capable of tracking our life the whole day, every day. Lifelogging systems do precisely this [37] , and track events related to a person's actions (such as exercise or food consumed), or their physical environment (such as exposure to smoke from a fire). Capturing all such events and data streams allows us to enhance the quality of continuous health monitoring systems. Our location history throughout the day can be combined with publicly available pollution and environmental data for computing our exposome, which has been found useful in studying underlying causes of different diseases and assessing disease risk factors [29] [42] [10] . There are IoT devices that can capture air quality and particulate matter concentration even when we are indoors, thus making our exposome even more accurate [4] . These user-generated data and event streams can be used to identify recurring user habits and lifestyle choices which impact their health in the long and short term. The importance of multimodal health tracking and estimation systems is even more apparent in the current context of the widespread pandemic of COVID-19. There are ongoing research studies to build early-diagnosis systems for COVID-19 using multimodal data collected from a variety of wearable devices [2][6]. Such systems can have an immense impact in our fight against this pandemic by diagnosing individuals before they become symptomatic and significantly reducing the community spread of the disease.",

It is necessary to combine all such events and data streams to enable multimodal applications to perform effective health estimation and guidance. We may want to combine events or data streams from different sources to identify more complex events that have a deterministic relationship with health parameters. Such events act as an interface between lifestyle events and biological systems; hence Here two examples of life events are given that cause opposite outcomes in cardiac adaptation. Both events at a crude level can be considered exercise, but precisely extracting the interface event is critical if we are to use the lifelog information to estimate evolving health states.",

Physical activities can strain our heart muscles in two ways, cardiovascular volume overload and pressure overload. Cardiovascular volume overload is a biological event where the heart is required to pump large volumes of blood through the circulatory system. This event would cause structural changes in the heart in the form of eccentric hypertrophy, where the left ventricular chamber volume increases. The volume overload interface event could be caused by a variety of exercise events such as cycling, jogging, soccer, dance, or hiking. Other exercise events such as weight lifting, sprinting, bouldering or even bowel constipation would cause pressure overload in the heart. These events would cause concentric hypertrophy of the heart [31] [28] [12] . This is illustrated in Figure 1 . In this case, we see that similar lifestyle events can have a vastly different impact on our heart, and it is important that we find the cardiovascular volume and pressure overload events if we want to find the impact of any exercise on our heart.",

Lifelogging is the first step towards recognizing various daily activities and how they define user's behavior. Lifelogging applications collect a variety of data streams about an individual, which has the potential to offer unique insights into human behavior. There are many visual lifelogging applications and projects which aim to understand the user's life and activities by using the images taken by a wearable camera (E.g., GoPro) over a long period and the data collected could be used to identify events and daily activities happening in user's life for varied purposes [47] [15][14] [46] . The daily activity recognition could be further enhanced by merging the visual log with other multi-sensory data that can be collected using smartphones, wearable devices, and different IoT systems [7] . Some applications attempt to accomplish this task without using the visual logs to make the logging process more unobtrusive [37] .",

This is especially true for natural language processing, where the data follows the grammatical rules of the language. Knowledge-driven retrieval is appropriate in such situations, where we know the composition of events in terms of other events or patterns observed in data streams. This kind of structure allows us to specify the events as patterns of other events or patterns in data streams. This has been demonstrated in [19] , [36] . [19] utilizes lexico-syntactic patterns related to an event to identify and extract the sentences about the event from web search results.

Building the Personal Event Chronicle is an active research topic, and many researchers are working on systems to recognize and combine daily life events from different sources and sensors in an unobtrusive manner. [37] describes a system that utilizes a smartphone to collect various data streams and segment an individual's day into widely recognized life events [23] . In this work, we propose to use any such system which recognizes a subset of life events and aggregate the output of those systems to recognize events that directly impact user's health in one or more ways. We view every system as a source for a stream of events, and each event may also have a set of data streams associated with it, which provide additional information about the event. For example, a running event captured using a wearable device may have been recognized using the corresponding accelerometer data and has associated heart rate and GPS position streams, which provide information about the event such as calories burned, altitude change, and average pace during the event.

Every time we eat, sleep, or walk up a set of stairs, our health state changes imperceptibly. Over time, these changes accumulate and may present themselves as chronic diseases. In order to provide health navigation for individuals [33] , we need to recognize all such events that are relevant for determining a user's health state. We have adopted a knowledge-driven approach to recognize and retrieve those events. We are calling these interface events as these act as an interface between daily events and biological systems. A lot of these interface events have been recognized in the medical literature. For example, PM2.5 exposure and circadian rhythm disruption are caused by different lifestyle events such as outdoor exercises, changes in sleeping and eating habits, and screen activity and impact the functioning of various biological systems ( Figure  2) . Similarly, links between diet and various chronic diseases such as type II diabetes, hypertension, and ASCVD has been well established in the literature. Thus, we must utilize the existing knowledge to guide the retrieval of these interface events from user-generated data. The interface events can be specified as transformations and combinations of existing events and data streams. These transformations can be as varied as applying a threshold on a data stream (e.g., binning heart rate in different ranges) to recognizing events and actions from a video stream (e.g., fall detection). We currently use a subset of the event pattern language proposed in [21] to describe the interface events. We have implemented a subset of the event operators described in [21] specifically NOT (\u00ac), AND(\u2227), OR(\u2228) and DELAY(\u03b4 ) operators, which can be used in conjunction with user-defined event detection operators to describe complex events. For example, if we want to identify events where the heart rate of the individual is above 120 bpm, and PM2.5 concentration is above 10 \u00b5g/m 3 of air, then we would need first to create a PM2.5 stream using their location stream. We could then define these exposure events using the formulation given below. Figure 4 shows some of the retrieved events.",

The events log table contains, and each data stream has its table in the relational database. All data adapters have the same basic framework. They access a source-relation mapping to identify corresponding relations for every data stream and, if needed, create a new table for the data stream by picking one of the available schema (Fig. 5) . After creating different relational data objects for the data streams and event streams, the adapters pass these objects to a database connector object which handles the I/O operations in the database. This data model allows us to create a new data stream by combining data from multiple sources, thus providing a less sparse data source for events.

For example, if we are trying to estimate the cardiovascular health of an individual, the researcher or the user should be able to specify the interface events using the event pattern language.

This is evident in fig. 6 , which depicts the occurrences of cardiovascular volume and pressure overload events. Volume overload events are detected in two ways, 1) We identify intervals with a sufficiently high heart rate, and 2) We identify intervals where the person is climbing up represented as colored arcs on that circle. Volume and pressure overload events are retrieved using lifestyle data and events such as heart rate and exercise events. We can see that we can retrieve a significantly larger number of interface events by combining events from multiple data streams. This figure also shows the environmental interface events. High PM2.5 intake events are recognized over one week. These are the instances where per minute PM2.5 intake was higher than 0.7 \u00b5g. Low blood oxygen events are recognized over one year, where blood oxygen saturation goes below 95%. The highlighted sectors roughly represent the time between sunrise and sunset; thus, we can see how different events overlap with circadian patterns. a slope under their power (e.g., cycling). These two event definitions are combined using an OR operator to give all occurrences of volume overload events. We could add more methods of recognizing volume overload events using the same operator with minimal additional effort. Similarly, pressure overload events are being recognized from heart rate data stream (spike detection) and power stream (high effort intervals). These events are, by definition, short, and the same can also be seen in fig 6. We can also combine the user-generated data with environmental data to generate their exposome streams. Figure 6 shows the occurrences of PM2.5 intake events over a week, and low blood oxygen events over a year.",

As we showed, using multiple data streams in a knowledge-driven manner allows us to leverage the available medical literature and also leaves the possibility of adding new data streams and information sources in the future. One drawback of this approach is the effort needed to convert the existing knowledge into event operator language. However, we believe that with the advances in natural language processing and knowledge graphs, we may be able to automate this process by directly converting the insights from medical literature to events definition. The approach detailed in this paper facilitates continuous health state estimation and, eventually, continuous health navigation, as described in [33] .",

The graph depicting the causal relationship between various measured and estimated variables is depicted in fig. 9 . The interface events for this estimation scheme were sleep and exercise events. We used sleep events to estimate the user's resting heart rate and aggregated the exercise events' duration to estimate the change in arteriovenous oxygen difference from its base value [1] . The details for this project could be found in [32] . A nutrition guidance/recommendation system could utilize such a system to calculate an individual's electrolyte requirements by combining their location stream with local weather to estimate their activity levels and local temperature, which in turn allows us to estimate how much sodium they lost through sweat [34] . This can be generalized to other macronutrients too.",

Causal discovery algorithms could be used to find a causal link between different lifestyle events and biological parameters [11] . Such causal links indicate an unknown interface event.
