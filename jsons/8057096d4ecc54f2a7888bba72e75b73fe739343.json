This work made an early prediction of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China based on a simple mathematical model and limited epidemiological data. Combing characteristics of the historical epidemic, we found part of the released data is unreasonable. Through ruling out the unreasonable data, the model predictions exhibit that the number of the cumulative 2019-nCoV cases may reach 76,000 to 230,000, with a peak of the unrecovered infectives (22,000-74,000) occurring in late February to early March. After that, the infected cases will rapidly monotonically decrease until early May to late June, when the 2019-nCoV outbreak will fade out. Strong anti-epidemic measures may reduce the cumulative infected cases by 40%-49%. The improvement of medical care can also lead to about one-half transmission decrease and effectively shorten the duration of the 2019-nCoV.",

On 7 January 2020, Chinese government and the World Health Organization (WHO) identified a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative virus, which belongs to the same virus family of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that outbroke also in South China in 2002-2003 [2] . The 2019-nCoV spread rapidly across most regions in mainland China after 17 January 2020 and leaded to over 7000 infectious cases at the end of January (Fig. 1a) . The number of the first-month cumulative cases of the 2019-CoV has exceeded the total number of the SARS cases in 2003, suggesting this novel virus has stronger infectivity than the SARS virus. Since about 23 Jan 2020, the Chinese Government has taken strong measures The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Jonghoon Kim . to prohibit the virus's transmission, such as warning citizens from going outdoors, temporarily suspending the public transport between some big cities, and even taking quarantine for the main infected city. These unprecedented measures were expected to effectively stop the virus transmission and buy necessary time to deploy medical resources to the affected area. At the same time, considering the virus having exported to other countries, including Thailand [3] , Japan [4] , South Korea [5] and the United States of America [6] , the WHO has made decision on identifying the 2019-nCoV outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [7] .",

Releasing the epidemic information in a timely and accurate way is extremely important for the anti-epidemic response of the public. The authentic and transparent information could have prohibited the spread of the 2019-nCoV at the early stage. The other cause is the lacking of scientific diagnostic criterion for the 2019-nCoV. Rapid developing exact testing techniques for a novel virus is very difficult. In fact, the symptoms of the 2019-nCoV are highly similar to those of flu. This aggravated the hardship of diagnosis. The last but not the least, the lacking of an epidemic warning and prediction system lost the opportunity to prohibit the epidemic spread at the initial stage.",

But, the outbreak of the 2019-CoV is just coincident with the large-scale population migration during the most important traditional Chinese festival, which exacerbated the spreading of virus and simultaneously greatly increased the difficulty of the epidemiological investigation. So, on the other hand, monitoring and predicting the evolution of the epidemic becomes extremely meaningful for the decision making against the public health crisis. Mathematical modelling has gained more attention and awareness in epidemiology and the medical sciences [8] - [10] . One family of these models is the dynamical epidemic model called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model [11] . The SIR model originated from the study of the plague almost one hundred years ago [12] . Tremendous advance has been achieved in dynamical epidemic model since mid-20 th century [13] . In recent decades, some realistic factors influencing the epidemic transmission were included in the classic SIR model, such as the model considering the incubation stage [14] , the SEIRS model considering the population age and the population exposed to epidemic [15] , and the SIS model including birth and death of the susceptible [16] . Some dynamical models were also designed for specific epidemic. For example, the dynamical models were designed to simulate spreading of HIV, SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [2] , [17] - [19] . As the development of new methods, the complex network and machining learning were combined with the dynamical model and created a promising direction of the epidemic prediction [20] , [21] .",

As was mentioned in the above, the family of the SIR model has developed complex model to considering more detailed classes of individuals, such as the exposed class and the protection class [11] . In general, the more realistic the model is, the more precisive prediction the model can make. But, the model considering more realistic factors needs more data to define additional parameters. On the other hand, some effort has also been made on simplified model. For example, the well-known logistic equation was used of as the twocompartment ''S-I'' (Susceptible -Infectious) model, which can be further included some stochastic processes in the modelling of SARS [22] . The above-mentioned researches prove that the SIR-family models at different complex levels can well capture the basic mechanism of the epidemic transmission.",

Focusing on the infection rate and removal rate, several experiments were designed to simulate the spreading of 2019-nCoV under different levels of anti-epidemic measure and medical care. The prediction intervals of the infective number and its inflection point, as well as those of the cumulative infected cases and the fading-out time of the epidemic, were presented.

(1), the solution of S generally follows a function monotonically decreasing to a stable final value until the epidemic fading out [11] . The initial value of S is given empirically according to the community population affected by the disease. But, the 2019-nCoV outbroke in Wuhan, a big city with population over ten million. The high population density and frequent population mobility made it hard to exactly estimate the susceptible population in Wuhan, let alone the whole mainland China. Therefore, we assume that the infected population of the 2019-nCoV can be omitted with compared to the huge susceptible population in China. That is to say, we can treat the variable S as a large constant with compared to the variable I . With this assumption, Eq. (1) can thus be dropped out from the coupled system Eq. (1-3). For the rest two-equation system, i.e., Eqs. (2) (3) , the change of the infectives (I ) is thought to be more important for epidemic prediction than the removed infectives (R).

Here, we assume the two kinds of viruses both follow the basic rule of epidemic transmission. From the knowledge of epidemic transmission [22] , the variable I follows a bell-shaped function, i.e., increasing from zero to a turning point and then decreasing to a stable value; the variable S and R, respectively, follow the monotonically decreasing and increasing functions until reaching their stable states. This requires the parameter \u03b2 and \u03b3 satisfying a monotonically decreasing and increasing function, respectively. So, this is one key criterion to fit the parameters in practice. The infection rate (\u03b2) and removal rate (\u03b3 ) can be obtained statistically or empirically. For the early prediction discussed here, we should firstly evaluate the reliability of the available data with combing the knowledge of the historical epidemic, such as SARS in 2003. To do this, several subsets of the epidemiological data are extracted by resampling from the available data. We tried to identify the reasonable subsets of epidemiological data for the model prediction via evaluating the reasonability of the fitted infection rate (\u03b2) from different subsets of data. In the objective analysis of data, there are two criterions used to rule out the unrealistic dataset. One is that the fitted parameter \u03b2 should be monotonically decreasing with time, otherwise, the modelled epidemic will not stop unless all the susceptibles become infectives. This extreme situation is particularly impossible for the epidemic spread over an area like China, which has large spatial scale and huge susceptible population. The other rule-out criterion is VOLUME 8, 2020 the fitted \u03b2 exhibits unrealistically sharp decrease, which will let model significantly underestimate the epidemic transmissibility and predict much less infectives than the real data. Through investigating the characteristics of the fitted infection rates based on different data subsets, we can obtain the reasonable estimates of \u03b2 according to the above two criterions.",

Figure 1a shows the number of infectives (I ) and the SIR prediction of the SARS over Mainland China during 10 April 2003 to 24 June 2003 [23] . The simplified SIR model (Eq. (4)) well depicts the propagation of the SARS in 2003. In contrast, the 2019-nCoV shows a pulse-like increase of infected cases after day 10. As shown by Table 1 , the epidemiological data that can be used by the model was released since 11 January 2020 although some cases of unknown pneumonia have been identified earlier. During 11 January \u221215 January, the cumulative infectives keeps unchanged at 41 cases, i.e., zero infection rate (\u03b2) in the first 5 days. But, on 18 January, the infectives (121 cases) is almost doubled, which causes a pulse-like infection rate of 1.44 per day. The huge change of the infection rate seems not to be explained as the natural variation of the epidemic. The sharp increase of the confirmed infected cases at such a short time may be attributable to the improvements of the government emphasis on the disease and the diagnosis technique. Therefore, the data before 18 January should be used with caution. Since then, all the provinces of China began to continuously release and update the epidemiological data. It is supposed that the data after that day is more reliable to reflect the characteristic of the 2019-nCoV.",

That means every two 2019-nCoV infectives can infect at least one person per day. This rate is more than the doubled infection rate of the SARS in 2003 (Fig. 1b) . Therefore, from the initial epidemiological characteristics, the 2019-nCoV virus exhibited a much stronger infectivity than the SARS virus. This feature was also reported by some latest model studies of 2019-nCoV [24] , [25] . As was mentioned in the above, the infection rate is a key parameter determining the prediction of the epidemic spread based on the SIR model. In order to predict the future infective number, the infection rate is often specified as a constant or a time-varying analytical function. For SARS, 2019-nCoV and other epidemics, treating the infection rate as a time-varying variable [26] can capture the dynamical process of the epidemic transmission, including the natural processes and the human intervention. As the fitted line shown in Fig. 1b , the infection rate of the SARS in 2003 well satisfies a monotonically decreasing exponential function, particular after day 20. This analytical function of \u03b2 is then substituted into Eq. (4) to make epidemic prediction. Figure 1a shows that the predicted the evolution of the infective number of 2003-SARS is highly consistent with the real data (Fig. 1a) .",

Thus, we can obtain the ten subsets successively named by the first day of the extracted data, i.e., t 0 = Jan \u2212 11, t 0 = Jan \u2212 12, . . . , t 0 = Jan \u2212 20. The dataset t 0 = Jan \u2212 11 means all of the released data since 11 January is extracted, and t 0 = Jan \u2212 20 for the data after 19 January. These subsets of data are then used to fit \u03b2 functions of the 2019-nCoV. Therefore, we totally got 10 linear functions and 10 exponential functions of \u03b2, as shown in Fig. 2 . Ten straight lines in Fig. 2a are those fitted by linear regression model. It is found that the positive slopes of the fit lines are obtained based on the datasets before 16 January. After that day, the negative slopes for \u03b2 are fitted. With the knowledge of the historical epidemic, the parameter \u03b2 has to be a constant or satisfy a monotonically decreasing function. The increasing \u03b2 will lead to unrealistic growth of the infectives that cannot converge to a stable state. So, the data before 16 January should be ruled out from the analysis. The rest five linear functions, namely from t 0 = Jan \u2212 16 to t 0 = Jan \u2212 20, can be substituted into the model Eq. (4) for temporal integration.",

Similarly, we also tried to exponentially fit the 2019-nCoV infection rate. As shown by Fig. 2b , the fitted \u03b2 exponential functions also show large differences between different subsets of data. The uncertainties are largely caused by the data quality. It was found that all the fitted functions using the data before 14 January (t 0 = Jan\u221211 to t 0 = Jan\u221213) are monotonically increasing, which can be ruled out according the above-mentioned criterions. The estimations of t 0 = Jan \u2212 16 to t 0 = Jan \u2212 18 have steep downward slopes due to the pulse-like increase of \u03b2 between 17 Jan-18 Jan,, which may result in unrealistically strong prohibition of the infective number. On the contrary, the unrealistic increase of the predicted infectives may be caused by the \u03b2 function with slow decreasing speed (t 0 = Jan \u2212 14) or large base infection rate (t 0 = Jan \u2212 15). Only the two \u03b2 functions (t 0 = Jan \u2212 19 and t 0 = Jan \u2212 20) seems to have appropriate slopes and base values. The reasonability of the \u03b2 functions from subset t 0 = Jan \u2212 14 to t 0 = Jan \u2212 20 will be further discussed in Fig.3a .",

As shown in Table1, the mean value of \u03b3 is about 0.04, which means four out of one hundred infectives are cured or dead per day. It is also found that the parameter \u03b3 stays around 0.02 with weak decreasing trend after 17 January, but fluctuates in large amplitude between 0.1 and 0.2 before that day. This dramatic change of the removal rate also reflects the unnatural influence mentioned above. But for the data after 17 January, the low removal rate with the decreasing trend may be attributable to that most infectives have not yet finished the whole course of the disease. So, at the initial stage of the epidemic outbreak, few fully recovered or dead infectives is not enough to exactly fit the function of the removal rate. The slightly downward trend of \u03b3 (Table 1) will lead to a monotonically decreasing function and thus extreme overestimation of the infected cases by model prediction. So, instead of setting a varying removal rate, this work specifies \u03b3 as a constant. The sensitivity experiments (figure not shown) to \u03b3 were performed under the two \u03b2 functions (t 0 = Jan\u221219 and t 0 = Jan \u2212 20) (Fig. 2b) .

Here, we set the levels of removal rate as \u03b3 = 0.05, 0.06,0.07 to represent low, moderate and high medical levels. Combined with the two anti-epidemic levels defined by \u03b2 function shown in Fig. 2a, i.e., t 0 = 19 \u2212 Jan and t 0 = 20 \u2212 Jan of exponential \u03b2 functions, we totally get six scenarios of the 2019-nCoV propagation in Figs. 3b, c. With compared to low-level antiepidemic scenarios (t 0 = 19 \u2212 Jan), the strengthened measures (t 0 = 20 \u2212 Jan) reduce the peak infected cases by 47%, 42% and 38%, and the cumulative cases by 49%, 44% and 40% under low, moderate and high medical levels (\u03b3 ), respectively. It is also found that the decrease of the infection rate cannot significantly influence the duration of the 2019-nCoV outbreak under the same \u03b3 . However, the increase of \u03b3 is more effective in prohibiting the infected number. It is estimated from the model predictions that every increase of the removal rate in \u03b3 = 0.01 (about 16%-20%) will lead to 50%-60% decrease of infected cases (Fig. 3b) , and 40%-50% decrease of cumulative cases (Fig. 3c) . Furthermore, large removal rate or high-level medical care significantly shortens the duration of the epidemic outbreak. Under the t 0 = 19 \u2212 Jan function of \u03b2, the model with \u03b3 = 0.06 predicts the 2019-nCoV will fade out in late May. But under \u03b3 = 0.07 and the same \u03b2 function, that fading-out time is advanced to early May (Fig. 3b) .

So, until the authors finished this work, the reliable data only covers no more than two weeks, which may lead to large uncertainty in the early prediction of the 2019-nCoV outbreak. But, the effort of the early prediction is still meaningful. Mathematical models of different complexities have been proved to be effective in predicting the evolution of epidemic outbreak. But, the more complex the structure of the model, the more parameters are needed to be determined. Under the condition of lacking epidemiological data, it is hard to objectively determine all the parameters. Too many unknown parameters will bring large uncertainties in the model prediction. Based on the point, this work formulated a simplified SIR model with the least parameters, i.e., the infection rate and the removal rate, to reduce the uncertainty as much as possible.

The predictions are supposed to be a helpful guide to the decision making in coping with the ongoing 2019-nCoV transmission in China. The strictness of the current quarantine measures and infection control precautions employed by Chinese Government is historically unprecedented. So, as predicted by this work, the control measures should pay more attention to the medical-service aspects, such as accelerating the diagnostic speed and enhancing the hospitalization capacity. If all the above efforts get the cumulative infected cases down to below about 80,000 until late February (Fig. 3c) , the severity of the 2019-nCoV may be controlled at the relatively low level finally. The sensitivity of the simplifiedmodel prediction to the parameters also emphasized the importance of the openness and transparency in releasing the data relevant to the public health. As the progressing of the 2019-nCoV, more epidemiological data will be available to verify and revise this early prediction of the 2019-nCoV.",
