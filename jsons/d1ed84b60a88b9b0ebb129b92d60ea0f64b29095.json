The dominant symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 are fever and cough . However, a proportion of patients showed multi-organ damage and dysfunction Zhu et al., 2020) . Of note, liver damage is emerging as a co-existed symptom reported in patients with COVID-19. A recent epidemiologic study in Shanghai (China) reported that 75 out of 148 (50.7%) COVID-19 patients had liver function abnormality, indicated by key liver function parameters above the normal range, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or total bilirubin (TBIL) . A nationwide clinical study collecting 1,099 COVID-19 patients revealed that around 20% of patients had elevated ALT and AST and around 10% of patients had elevated TBIL. Especially, the percentage of patients with liver damage is much higher among severe COVID-19 patients than patients with mild symptoms . Although clinical correlation has been implicated, it remains unclear whether the liver damage is caused by direct virus infection in the liver or by systematic dysfunction such as cytokine storm.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for host cell entering and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for viral spike (S) protein priming (Kuhn et al., 2004; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . It has been shown that ACE2 expression is widely distributed across human tissues, including lung, liver, kidney and multiple digestive tract organs (Qi et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) . Significant enrichment of ACE2+ population in cholangiocytes compared to hepatocytes in the human healthy liver was reported recently (Chai et al., 2020) , implying that SARS-CoV-2 might directly target ACE2+ cholangiocytes in patients. However, whether the virus indeed infects human cholangiocytes thus causes local damage has not been addressed yet.",

To establish the SARS-CoV-2 infection model with human liver ductal organoids, we first determined whether the long-term organoid culture could preserve the cholangiocytes expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 ex vivo. We processed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to interrogate the transcriptome of cholangiocytes in human liver ductal organoids. A total number of 7,978 cells were analyzed and cell populations were visualized by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), partitioning the cells into 7 clusters (Fig. 1A) . The common cholangiocyte markers epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) and keratin 19 (KRT19) were uniformly highly expressed in all the 7 clusters, indicating the heterogeneity of cholangiocytes in these organoids was relatively low (Fig. 1B) . Notably, we identified the SARS-CoV-2 receptor gene ACE2 expressed sparsely among cluster 0-5 in unbiased preferences and was detectable in 2.92% cells (233 out of 7,978) ( Fig. 1C and 1D). Anti-ACE2 immunostaining further verified the presence of ACE2+ cholangiocytes in human liver ductal organoids (Fig. 1E) . Besides, TMPRSS2 expressed uniformly across all the clusters and accounted for 51.45% of the total cells (4,105 out of 7,978), it is worth mentioning that 68.24% of the ACE2+ cells were co-expressing TMPRSS2 (159 out of 233) ( Fig. 1C and 1D ), making this cell population potentially highly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Taken together, our data demonstrate that long-term human liver ductal organoid culture preserves the human-specific ACE2+/TMPRSS2+ population of cholangiocytes. Next, we examined the susceptibility of human liver ductal organoids to SARS-CoV-2. We isolated and plaque-purified the SARS-CoV-2 from a COVID-19 patient in Shanghai. The liver ductal organoids from two individuals were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h then re-embedded in Matrigel and maintained in the culture medium. We performed immunostaining to identify the virus-positive cholangiocytes 24 h post-infection. The expression of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein was readily detected in patchy areas of human liver ductal organoids whereas no signal was found in uninfected control ( Fig. 2A) . In addition, the infected cholangiocytes underwent membrane fusion and formed syncytia ( Fig. 2A, enlarge) . Although the number of infected cholangiocytes was limited, the examination of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNAs revealed a dramatic increase of viral load in organoids at 24 h post-infection (qRT-PCR in Fig. 2B and ORF1 reads count analysis in Fig. 2C ). These data demonstrate that human liver ductal organoids are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and support robust viral replication. The recapitulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human organoids suggests that this model could be employed to dissect the viral pathogenesis and to test antivirals.",

The main function of cholangiocytes in homeostasis is to transport bile acid secreted by hepatocytes into bile ducts. The tight junction between cholangiocytes maintains the barrier function of bile ductal epithelium, which is essential for bile acid collection and excretion. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection ablated the expression of claudin 1 (CLDN1) (Fig. 2F ). In addition, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that SARS-CoV-2-infected organoids had decreased enrichment of cell junction organization signature genes (Fig. 2G) , suggesting that the barrier function of bile ductal epithelium was disrupted. More importantly, the expression of two major bile acid transporter genes, solute carrier family 10 member 2 (SLC10A2) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), was significantly decreased following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 2F) . These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through modulating the expression of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation. Our study therefore supports the idea that the liver damage in COVID-19 patients might result from direct cholangiocyte injury and consequent bile acid accumulation induced by viral infection.",
