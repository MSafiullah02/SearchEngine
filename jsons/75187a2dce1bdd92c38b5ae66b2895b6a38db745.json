            "text": "United Kingdom 5 have caused public health concerns, and highlighted the dangers of zoonotic transmissions of novel or emerging organisms across the species barrier, as well as drawn attention to the need for vigilance and public health surveillance. Unfortunately, due to its low incidence and logistical challenges in multidisciplinary collaboration, CNS infection is difficult to study prospectively, and MRI characteristics of infectious diseases are not well-described. The Singapore Neurologic Infections Program (SNIP) was set up as a prospective multi-hospital, multidisciplinary, nationwide surveillance study to capture, describe and study the epidemiology of CNS infections and to identify and assist in outbreak detection in Singapore. 6 Since December 2014, an unusual cluster of patients with group B streptococcus (GBS) infection amongst healthy nonpregnant adults was observed in Singapore. The cause of the outbreak, thought to be related to consuming infected raw freshwater fish, is currently being investigated. 7, 8 GBS is a common gastrointestinal and genitourinary commensal organism, and although it is an important cause of bacteremia and meningitis in neonates and pregnant women, it seldom causes disease in healthy adults; food-borne zoonotic GBS infection has not been well-described in the literature. 9 Although there is recent recognition that this organism is a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality among patients with chronic underlying conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, malignancy, neurologic disorders, and skin diseases, [10] [11] [12] these adults with invasive GBS infection and comorbidities typically suffered from urinary tract and soft tissue infection, osteomyelitis, infective endocarditis and pneumonia; only a minority had meningitis. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] During the Singapore outbreak of GBS infection, an increased frequency and unusual manifestations were noticed during the prospective surveillance of acute CNS infections by the SNIP investigators and other physicians (T. Barkham and B. Ang, unpublished data). We describe here the clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging features of a cluster of adults with CNS infections caused by GBS.",

            "text": "In the recent past, clusters of patients with unusual CNS manifestations and abnormal DWI and computed tomography have been described in infectious disease outbreaks in Singapore. These included detecting microinfarction in Nipah virus encephalitis from a novel pig-borne virus 3,20,21 and large artery thrombosis in severe acute respiratory syndrome or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a novel zoonotic coronavirus causing pneumonia. 22 These early case descriptions based on multi-hospital and multidisciplinary collaborations in situations of important public health hazards, enabled local investigators to conduct surveillance and follow-up of patients. Our current study thus illustrates the potential contribution of MRI in surveillance programs such as SNIP to identify and report unusual patterns of cases of CNS infection. [20] [21] [22] In our cohort of patients, initial MRI detected conspicuous abnormalities on DWI, consistent with meningitis and pus in the subarachnoid space and lateral ventricles caused by GBS meningitis. Meningeal infection due to bacteria, tuberculosis or fungi can cause subarachnoid DWI hyperintensities in both adult and children, in addition to conventional MRI features such as meningeal enhancement, cerebral abscess formation, or hydrocephalus. [23] [24] [25] [26] Furthermore, sulcal and ventricular DWI abnormalities have been described to occur more often in Streptococcus pneumoniae, compared with meningitis caused by other organisms, and our cases, caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, appear to show similarities. 24 In some of our patients, these tiny abnormalities in the dependent portions of the occipital horns were the only abnormal finding in an otherwise normal MRI study, consistent with past reports that DWI was more conspicuous and sensitive to detection of ventricular pus than conventional pulse sequences. 27, 28 Unlike GBS that affects neonates by means of maternal transmission, there are few reports of MRI findings in adult GBS, but features similar to ours have also been described. 26 Our results highlight the utility of DWI to detect and diagnose subtle findings in CNS infection. 28, 29 In many patients, we also found DWI hyperintensities in the brain parenchyma suggestive of cerebral infarction. These lesions were hyperintense on early DWI (within 10 days of symptom onset), many were not visible on conventional T2-weighted or FLAIR images, and all did not enhance after contrast injection. These features are suspicious of acute focal or multifocal subcortical cerebral infarction 30 which can complicate bacterial meningitis [31] [32] [33] [34] and viral encephalitis. 20, 21, 35 However, the pattern of our DWI findings differed from the large territorial cerebral infarction and vasculitic narrowing of the major intracranial arteries detected on MR angiography previously described in neonatal GBS. [17] [18] [19] 23 The relationship between CNS infections and acute ischemic stroke is complex, 33, 34 and alternative explanations for MRI findings other than cerebral infarction, including cerebritis from direct infection by bacterial invasion, also need to be considered. 24, 36 The cerebellar MRI findings in our patients are also unusual for CNS infection: they did not correlate with clinical features and are difficult to characterize. The cerebellum may be involved in CNS infection, either by direct invasion (typically described in Listeria monocytogenes, Mycoplasma pneumonia, typhoid fever, Lyme disease, and Whipple disease) or later in the course of disease from post-infectious immune-mediated mechanisms, with several small neuroimaging series describing normal MRI or diffuse cerebellar swelling with hydrocephalus and brain herniation. 37, 38 However, the distinction between direct invasion and immune-mediated damage is difficult, and neither finding has been well-described in GBS infection. On the other hand, the findings on DWI in our patients bear some similarity to the typical multifocal and patchy appearance of acute cerebellar infarction. 39 Hence, we postulate that at least some of the findings in our patients with small, multifocal involvement of the gray matter of the vermis and hemispheres may be more consistent with cerebral infarction rather than direct infectious cerebellitis. Other, more complex MRI features such as case 14 with T2-weighted rather than DWI involvement of the entire basal ganglia, are unexplained, and the unifying pathological cause for the DWI hyperintensities still remains to be elucidated.",

As it reports only the initial MRI findings on admission in patients enrolled in SNIP in an ongoing infectious outbreak, comparison with a nationally co-ordinated database of cases (S.

GBS infection can be classified according to serotypes (I to IX), and initial studies suggest that this outbreak associated with consumption of raw freshwater Song fish (bighead carp) and Toman fish (snakehead), was associated with Streptococcus agalactiae serotype III, specifically sequence type (ST) 283. 40 This potential foodborne zoonotic source had previously been reported to cause severe disease in farmed fish in Asia, and further study is needed to determine virulence factors of the bacteria which could account for the severity and relative incidence of complications, as well as the pathological features and source of the outbreak. 7, 8, 41, 42 Because meningitis and cerebral infarction have been previously reported to be associated with poor prognosis, follow-up studies of our patients will also be needed, as would comparison of MRI features of meningitis caused by GBS and other organisms. 26 Nevertheless, our initial findings demonstrate that some patterns of MRI features that may be useful to alert clinicians and radiologists to the novel GBS CNS infection outbreak involving Streptococcus agalactiae Serotype III.",
