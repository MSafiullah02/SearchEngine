There is limited data to base decision making on in this climate, and many guidelines have had to be written in a data vacuum. It is concerning seeing International Scientific Societies and Health Care Institutions endorsing recommendations and guidelines promoting for the first time 'new' standards of practice backed up by severely limited science. Perhaps the race to publish \"something\" has been prioritized over the one to generate solid knowledge. For many solid tumours, algorithms to prioritize patients based on cancer type and extension, prognosis, life expectancy, treatment opportunities, as well as risk of COVID infection have been proposed with varying results. These versions of patient selection scores carry substantial ethical dilemmas, especially when related to senior adults and palliative patients who have been prevented, based on many of these algorithms, to have access to care. Surgeons have to balance utilitarian and deontological principles, keeping in mind that delaying probably decreases survival and may significantly impact quality of life. Non-operative strategies have been recommended in some cases, as treatment pathways have been urgently redesigned, but uncertainty remains about the mid-and long-term impact.",

Thus, it becomes necessary to focus on the longer effects on cancer management. One strategy to overcome near-future failures has been tried in areas with small volumes of COVID where clean areas within hospitals or entire hospitals have been preserved as \"clean\" site for cancer surgery to continue in a \"cocooned\" environment. The challenge in maintaining a \"clean\" site is significant. Techniques described include getting patients to self-isolate prior to admission, screening patients before admission with swabs and frequent screening and appropriate PPE for healthcare workers. The commitment of hospital administrations and politicians is essential. Surgeons should play a pivotal role in coordinating cancer-services reorganisation.",
