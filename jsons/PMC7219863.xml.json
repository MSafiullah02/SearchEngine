In our article,2 we emphasized the possibility of spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to endoscopy team members in an ambulatory endoscopy center. Viral transmission may occur during the asymptomatic period of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) via aerosolized viral particles generated from vomitus and stool or body fluids leaked via the endoscopic equipment.",

These groups of patients facilitate rapid dissemination of COVID-19 and are a major source of documented cases leading to a rapid pandemic status.6 For these reasons, we strongly agree with Drs Hagan et al2 that we should make every effort to prevent the transmission of this virus, including administration of a reliable diagnostic test, such as a reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction before the procedure and taking strict protective measures, including effective use of personal protective equipment.",
