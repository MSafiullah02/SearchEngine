            "text": "ACE2 is a metalloproteinase and its active domain is exposed on the cell surface to facilitate the catalysis of circulating polypeptides. ACE2 can cleave angiotensin I into inactive angiotensin 1\u20139 (Ang 1\u20139) peptide,5\n,\n6 which is further converted by ACE or other peptidases into angiotensin 1\u20137 (Ang 1-7) peptide.5 Moreover, ACE2 can efficiently metabolize angiotensin \u2161 (Ang \u2161) into Ang 1\u20137, which binds to Mas receptor (Mas), a G-protein coupled receptor, to exert vasodilation and anti-proliferation effects.11 It is well established that Ang II has two G-protein-coupled receptors, the angiotensin \u2161 type 1 receptor (AT1R) and angiotensin \u2161 receptor type 2 receptor (AT2R). Ang II exerts its biological functions and is involved in in pathogenesis of various diseases mainly through AT1R. The activation of ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway leads to vasoconstriction, proliferation, fibrosis and inflammation, which may ultimately result in progressive tissue damage.9 The effects of Ang 1\u20137 counterbalance the deleterious effects of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway12, 13, 14, 15 (Figure 1\n). Ang 1\u20137 exerts multiple cardioprotective effects, including anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, anti-fibrotic, anti-arrhythmic, and natriuretic effects. It has also been shown to inhibit cardiac hypertrophy and plaque formation, and ameliorate vascular dysfunction.16 The ACE2/Ang 1\u20137/Mas pathway has shown beneficial effects in many animal models of hypertension, heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.17 In the lungs, the Ang 1\u20137 peptide inhibits inflammatory cell infiltration and regulates the release of anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines to alleviate lung inflammation. In addition, it also improves oxygenation, reduces airway hyperresponsiveness, decreases alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis, and inhibits fibroblast proliferation and migration, goblet cell metaplasia, and airway remodeling. The ACE2/Ang 1\u20137/Mas pathway has been shown to exert protective effects on the lungs in animal models of ARDS, asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension.18 In addition, in vitro experiments have shown that ACE2 cleaves apelin-13 to remove one amino acid from the C-terminal,11 which affects the hypotensive effects of apelin-13.",

In 2003, ACE2 was confirmed to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.19 ACE2 mediates infection of this virus, which is independent of its protease activity. Structural analysis shows that the spike protein of SARS-CoV comes in contact with the apex of subunit I in the catalytic domain of ACE2 without involvement of subunit II and does not block the active site. Once the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV spike protein binds to ACE2, the extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved and the transmembrane domain migrates into the cell, mediating further fusion between virus particles and host cells20 (Figure 2\n).",

Brake et al. showed elevated ACE2 protein levels in the lung tissues of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and smokers with normal lung function.24 Kuba et al25 demonstrated that ACE2 protein expression was significantly decreased in a mouse model of ALI. Koitka et al26 discovered that ACE2 mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in rats with kidney disease or rats that underwent subtotal nephrectomy. However, the precise molecular mechanism of ACE2 regulation remains unclear. Some transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms have been investigated. ACE2 was recognized as a target gene for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b2 (HNF-1\u03b2), as binding sites for HNF-1\u03b2 were identified in the promoter regions of ACE2.27 Accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1, a crucial transcription factor, was found to decrease ACE2 mRNA and protein levels at the later stages of hypoxia.28 Energy stress has been shown to regulate ACE2 mRNA expression by activating adenosine monophosphate kinase, following which sirtuin 1 binds to the promoter region of ACE2 and enhances its transcription.17 Furthermore, microRNA-421 was shown to bind with the 3\u02b9-untranslated region of ACE2 transcript and reduce ACE2 protein level post-transcriptionally.29\n",

Ishiyama et al30 employed a rat model of myocardial infarction to assess the effects of myocardial infarction on myocardial ACE2 mRNA expression. The results showed that myocardial infarction did not cause significant changes in the myocardial ACE2 mRNA level; however, when the rats were treated with the AT1R antagonists, losartan and olmesartan, for 28 days, the cardiomyocyte ACE2 mRNA level increased by 97% and 42%, respectively. This suggested that the cardioprotective effects of AT1R antagonists on myocardial infarction were partially mediated by ACE2. Subsequent studies showed that myocardial ACE2 mRNA levels were significantly increased when lisinopril, losartan, and a combination of these two drugs were administered to rats continuously for 12 days. In addition, losartan monotherapy or combined therapy with lisinopril has been shown to significantly increase myocardial ACE2 activity in rats.31 Keidar et al32 showed that mineralocorticoid(aldosterone) inhibition could inhibit oxidative stress through the Ang \u2161/nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling pathway, thereby increasing macrophage ACE2 mRNA levels in patients with heart failure. Interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-4 could reduce ACE2 mRNA levels and ACE2 expression in epithelial cells in vitro to decrease susceptibility to SARS-CoV.33 Additionally, Tikoo et al34 showed that ACE2 protein but not mRNA expression was downregulated in the rabbit heart and kidneys in a high-cholesterol diet-induced atherosclerosis model. However, atorvastatin treatment increased ACE2 protein expression in the heart and kidneys, but only increased ACE2 mRNA level in the heart. Furthermore, enhanced occupancy of histone H3 acetylation mark on the promoter region of ACE2 was observed in the heart after atorvastatin treatment, suggesting that epigenetic regulation might be involved.",

After the spike protein of SARS-CoV comes in contact with ACE2, the complete molecular structure or transmembrane domain of ACE2 and the virus are endocytosed (internalized) using clathrin. Under the effects of trypsin and furin, the spike proteins are further activated to induce membrane fusion, and the virus RNA is released into the cytoplasm, thereby infecting the cell19. In addition, cleavage of the extracellular domain of ACE2 (shedding) can occur under the action of the transmembrane protein, a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), to release the catalytic domain to the extracellular space35. Although the physiological function of shedding has not been fully elucidated, studies have shown that it is associated with virus entry into cells and virus replication36. In brief, internalization and shedding decrease ACE2 expression on the cell surface.",

            "text": "The whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was successfully determined by next-generation sequencing1. A comparison with the genome sequences of previously detected coronaviruses showed that SARS-CoV-2 was closely related to two bat SARS-like viruses (88% similarity): bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Evolutionary analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 belonged to the subgenus Sarbecovirus in the genus Betacoronavirus. A comparison of the spike protein sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV showed that the similarity of the entire spike protein sequence was 76%\u201378%, RBD was 73%\u201376%, and receptor binding motif (RBM) was 50%\u201353%.37 The high sequence similarity in spike proteins between these two viruses suggested that they utilized the same receptor, ACE2. Further analysis showed that ACE2 not only mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, but also resulted in human-to-human transmission. The RBD of SARS-CoV-2 interacted with ACE2 through its polar residues.38, 39, 40 Shang et al41 showed that the Asn487 and Ala475 residues in the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 formed an extra hydrogen bond in the main chain compared with that in SARS-CoV. This resulted in a tighter conformation in the ridge structure and the Ala475-containing loop approached ACE2. In addition, structural changes were observed in two virus-binding hotspots at the RBD/ACE2 interface, which increased binding interface stability. Therefore, the affinity between the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 was significantly higher than that between the RBD of SARS-CoV and ACE2.42 The higher affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for ACE2 enabled easier human-to-human transmission.43 Hoffmann et al44 performed in vitro experiments and showed that SARS-CoV-2 used host cell proteases to cleave the spike protein at the S1/S2 and S2\u2019 sites, thereby activating it, and then utilized ACE2 as a receptor to enter target cells. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV used transmembrane serine protease 2 to activate their spike proteins. Unlike in SARS-CoV, a furin cleavage site has been shown to be present between the S1/S2 subunits in SARS-CoV-2.38 Bao et al45 showed that SARS-CoV-2 could infect transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 to cause interstitial pneumonia, and the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 colocalized with ACE2 receptors on alveolar epithelial cells. These results show that ACE2 acts as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and mediates viral infection of cells.",

Its pathological presentation includes increased capillary permeability, characterized by the presence of neutrophils, macrophages, and protein-rich fluid in the alveolar cavity, and formation of hyaline membranes.46\n,\n47 Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-induced ARDS in 2003, the role of RAAS in ARDS and ALI has attracted widespread attention. In an animal model of ALI induced by acid aspiration, the Ang II levels in the mouse lungs and plasma were significantly increased, and ACE inactivation decreased Ang II levels. The latest study by Liu et al48 showed that Ang II levels were significantly elevated in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, ALI was shown to be less severe in complete Ace knockout (Ace\n\u2013/\u2013) mice, followed by partial Ace knockout (Ace\n+/\u2013) mice, which suggested that the expression level of ACE was associated with the severity of lung injury. Furthermore, lung injury was found to be less severe in AT1a receptor knockout mice than that in wild-type mice.49 In another study, the expression level of Ang II in mice was increased after injection of recombinant SARS spike protein, and treatment with an AT1R antagonist alleviated acute respiratory distress in these mice.25 A cohort study showed that insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in ACE was associated with ARDS susceptibility and prognosis. The proportion of ARDS patients with the D/D genotype was higher than that of control individuals with the D/D genotype, and the mortality rate of ARDS patients with the D/D genotype was higher than that of ARDS patients with the I/I genotype.50 These results showed that ACE/Ang \u2161/AT1R might mediate ALI pathogenesis.",

As the imbalance between ACE and ACE2 plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI, interventions targeting ACE2 may improve the prognosis of patients with severe COVID-19. In various animal models of ALI, administration of rhACE2 has been shown to improve distribution of pulmonary blood flow, lung function, and elastance, and attenuate edema formation, hypoxemia, and pulmonary hypertension.49\n,\n52 Moreover, rhACE2 was found to be capable of binding to the coronavirus directly. Li et al19 showed that a soluble form of ACE2 could bind the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV spike protein in Vero E6 cells with a high affinity. Hofmann et al53 proved that the soluble ACE2 ectodomain dose-dependently blocked SARS-CoV spike-induced pseudovirus infection of 293T cells. Recent in vitro experiments by Monteil et al. showed that rhACE2 dose-dependently decreased SARS-CoV-2 growth in Vero E6 cells by a factor of 1,000\u20135,000, and effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of human blood vessel and kidney organoids in vitro, which suggested that rhACE2 could block the early entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells.54 In addition, previous studies have validated the safety of rhACE2 in healthy volunteers and patients with ARDS without any adverse effects on hemodynamic parameters.55, 56, 57 Currently, the application of rhACE2 in patients with severe COVID-19 is in the trial phase (Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT04287686). Activators of ACE2, such as diminazene aceturate have been shown to increase the enzymatic activity of ACE2 and might exert protective effects on SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI.58 Besides, ACEIs and AT1R antagonists can be used to inhibit the effect of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis to alleviate lung injury. According to two recent observational studies, there is no evidence as yet that ACEIs or AT1R antagonists enhance the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.59\n,\n60 Similarly, Ang 1\u20137 peptide may be used for its protective effects on lung tissues through Mas.61\n",

An in-depth understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 will help in the development of targeted interventions to control the COVID-19 epidemic. ACE2 is not only a receptor that mediates coronavirus infection, but is also an important RAAS enzyme that regulates virus infection-induced ALI. Although increased ACE2 expression may elevate the risk of coronavirus infection, it may also have protective effects against ALI. However, the effects of enhanced ACE2 expression (such as RAAS inhibition) on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and patient outcomes are not fully understood, and further basic and clinical studies are urgently required.",
