These patients are particularly challenging, because it is unclear if the infiltrates are due to pulmonary involvement of leukaemia or to an infection resulting from the underlying immunosuppression (Koh et al, 2005). In cases where an informative lung biopsy (or autopsy) has been obtained, leukaemic infiltration along the lymphatics in the peribronchovascular, septal, and pleural interstitial tissue represents the typical pattern (Koh et al, 2005), and the majority of patients affected do not have pulmonary leucostasis caused by hyperleucocytosis (Potenza et al, 2003). An acute lysis pneumopathy associated with diffuse alveolar damage may occur during or shortly following the initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy (Tryka et al, 1982).",

However, at least during febrile neutropenia, virological diagnostic tests are seldom ordered because of uncertainty about their relevance and the lack of effective agents to treat these infections. The vast majority of RSV infections occur among haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, while reports on viral pneumonia in other patients mainly involve out\u2010patients and show conflicting results with regard to their clinical importance (Lehners et al, 2013). Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was identified in the early 2000s and affects up to 9% of adult patients with HM and symptoms of respiratory tract infection (Williams et al, 2005), but the outcome tends to be favourable despite the absence of effective anti\u2010hMPV antivirals (Godet et al, 2014).

However, among neutropenic patients with fever persisting despite more than 48 h of broad\u2010spectrum antibacterial therapy, only about 10% of CXR show abnormalities, while high\u2010resolution CT scans taken at the same time show pathological findings in approximately 50% of patients (Heussel et al, 1999). Abnormalities seen on CXR indicate a CT scan should be done to more specifically identify the most likely aetiology. Hence, a CXR is of very limited value, as a pulmonary CT scan (without contrast media) must be ordered anyway as soon as possible, preferably as part of the investigation of fever during neutropenia.",

The \u2018halo sign\u2019, i.e., a dense nodular infiltrate surrounded by an area of ground\u2010glass opacity representing an infarction and a haemorrhage, has been described as characteristic for neutropenic patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) (Bruno et al, 2007). The \u2018reversed halo sign\u2019, showing a focal rounded area of ground\u2010glass opacity surrounded by a crescent or complete ring of consolidation, has been reported to be relatively specific for fungal pneumonia due to mucormycosis (Georgiadou et al, 2011; Legouge et al, 2014). However, it also may also be associated with other lung diseases, such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (Godoy et al, 2012);The pattern of LI on the CT scan may also help to distinguish fungal from other aetiologies of LI (Caillot et al, 1997; Heussel et al, 2004). PcP typically causes diffuse perihilar infiltrates, areas of ground\u2010glass attenuation, cysts and septal thickening, consolidation and centrilobular nodules (Kanne et al, 2012; Vogel et al, 2012). However, this \u2018classical PcP pattern\u2019 has also been described for LI from acute leukaemia (Potenza et al, 2003). Nodular or cavitary lesions indicate an invasive \u2018mould\u2019 disease, while differential diagnoses include pneumonia caused by other microorganisms, such as mycobacteria (in patients from high prevalence areas), Nocardia, Pneumocystis jirovecii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and infiltrates by the underlying malignancy (Shorr et al, 2004).\n",

Magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) may be an alternative to a CT scan, but it appears to be inferior to CT in visualizing ground\u2010glass opacities (Attenberger et al, 2014).",

This may create a false impression that the current antifungal medication is ineffective and should be changed.

The diagnostic relevance of these culture results, however, is often difficult to assess (Boersma et al, 2007; Azoulay et al, 2008), because bronchial samples from these patients may contain microorganisms that have no aetiological significance, such as Candida species, coagulase\u2010negative staphylococci, viridans streptococci and enterococci. Moreover, bacteraemia due to these bacteria seldom, if ever, results in pneumonia. At the same time, as many as 3 of 4 cases of invasive fungal disease found at autopsy had not been detected ante mortem (Chamilos et al, 2006). By contrast, isolation of Aspergillus spp. or other filamentous fungi from oropharyngeal or upper respiratory tract specimens from severely immunocompromised patients is regarded as a sign of pulmonary mould infection (Perfect et al, 2001).",

CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is recommended for BAL samples from febrile neutropenic patients with LI, as the test has a high negative predictive value, so CMV can be excluded. However, the positive predictive value is low (Hohenthal et al, 2005), so rapid culture, immediate early antigen, direct fluorescent antibody tests, DNA hybridization or cytology is required to confirm the diagnosis of CMV pneumonia (Boeckh, 2011).",

It is essential to distinguish infection from colonization as this may affect over half of individuals without any signs or symptoms of PcP (Ponce et al, 2010). Meta\u2010analysis of PCR showed the test to exhibit both high sensitivity (99%) and specificity (90%) (Lu et al, 2011). Hence, a negative test result on a BAL sample indicates that anti\u2010Pneumocystis therapy is unnecessary. More recently, quantitative PCR assays have been shown to boost the specificity. A report on non\u2010HIV 71 patients with proven PcP showed a positive predictive value of 98% when more than 1450 organisms per ml were detected in BAL samples (M\u00fchlethaler et al, 2012), however, this threshold has not yet been prospectively evaluated in clinical studies, and in individual patients with severe PcP, a much lower copy number may be present.

Currently, an optical density (OD) index >0\u00b75 from blood samples is regarded as the threshold for detecting GM, whereas a cut\u2010off of \u22651\u00b70 is more appropriate for BAL samples (Zou et al, 2012), as this indicates probable invasive fungal disease in severely immunocompromised patients. Whether Aspergillus GM will be detected in blood earlier than finding suggestive infiltrates in a chest CT scan is contentious (Weisser et al, 2005). The GM test is also prone to yield false\u2010positive results in blood samples obtained from patients treated with semisynthetic beta\u2010lactam antibiotics, such as amoxicillin\u2010clavulanate, piperacillin\u2010tazobactam, carbapenems, ceftriaxone or cefepime (Boonsarngsuk et al, 2010), those given enteral nutrition (Girmenia et al, 2011) and those with other fungal infections, such as fusariosis (Tortorano et al, 2012). False\u2010positive GM can also be found in BAL samples obtained using specific lavage solutions, such as Plasmalyte\u2122 (Hage et al, 2007), and may also be due to blood products (Mart\u00edn\u2010Rabad\u00e1n et al, 2012). Systemic antifungal prophylaxis with a mould\u2010active azole, such as posaconazole, also reduces the reliability of the Aspergillus GM test (Duarte et al, 2014). A significant decline in GM OD indices was noted to result after storage of serum samples, but not BAL samples, so that the time from taking a blood sample to testing should be minimized (Johnson et al, 2013).",

PCR also appears useful for lung biopsy specimens in addition to histopathology and culture as it allows identification of the pathogen (Rickerts et al, 2007). The lack of standardization of PCR for blood and BAL samples was the primary reason for not incorporating these assays in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Mycoses Study Group (MSG) definitions for invasive fungal diseases. However, progress is being made by the European Aspergillus PCR Initiative (http://www.eapcri.eu), and a cogent argument has recently been published for now including PCR in the EORTC/MSG definitions (White et al, 2015). It also seems likely that PCR will be incorporated into diagnostic work\u2010ups for LI alongside thoracic CT scans, serology and conventional microbiology from blood and BAL samples (White et al, 2015). The combination of Aspergillus PCR and GM in BAL samples enhances diagnosis because the detection of both GM and PCR make the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis highly likely, as has been confirmed by meta\u2010analyses (Avni et al, 2012). Nonetheless, previous exposure to antifungal therapy may reduce the sensitivity of quantitative PCR assays as well as Aspergillus GM tests (McCulloch et al, 2012).",

Candida spp. are frequently isolated from respiratory tract samples, but represent the cause of LI only in rare cases of disseminated Candida fungaemia with haematogenous spread to the lungs (Kontoyiannis et al, 2002). Updated recommendations for the treatment of documented mucormycosis are provided in evidence\u2010based guidelines (Mousset et al, 2013; Cornely et al, 2014; Schelenz et al, 2015). First\u2010line treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is intravenous voriconazole (6 mg/kg every 12 h day 1, 4 mg/kg every 12 h thereafter) or liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/d), while for mucormycosis (zygomycosis), liposomal amphotericin B at a dose of \u22655 mg/kg/d is preferred. Most patients need more than 7\u201310 d of full\u2010dose antifungal therapy to show clinical improvement (defervescence, decreasing inflammatory parameters, declining dyspnoea, better oxygenation), whereas CT scans taken after the first week of treatment often show an increasing volume of LI (Caillot et al, 2001). Antifungal treatment should not be changed at this point, unless new LI emerge at previously normal pulmonary sites and clinical deterioration is obvious. A second infection, immune reconstitution syndrome, infiltrates caused by the underlying malignancy or toxic side effects from cancer treatment should be revisited (Segal et al, 2008).",

Treatment delay may enhance mortality (Guo et al, 2014). Blood gas analysis should be done before the start of antimicrobial therapy. If oxygen partial pressure is \u226570 mm Hg or alveolar\u2010arterial oxygen difference <45 mm Hg, upfront oral therapy may be considered, otherwise intravenous treatment is indicated. Treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks. Clinical improvement is expected after 5\u20138 d, otherwise a second infection should be considered and diagnostic procedures be repeated. If TMP/SMX is not tolerated or ineffective, clindamycin (600 mg three times daily or 450 mg four times daily) plus primaquine (30 mg/d orally) appear to be the most effective option (Smego et al, 2001). Other potential salvage regimens include atovaquone oral suspension (750 mg twice daily orally with meal) or intravenous pentamidine (4 mg/kg/d). Subsequently, patients should be given secondary prophylaxis with TMP/SMX 160/800 mg given orally on 3 d per week or monthly pentamidine inhalation at a dose of 300 mg. In patients with respiratory failure, the use of systemic corticosteroids is controversial, as recent (non\u2010randomized) studies did not show a clinical benefit (Moon et al, 2011) or were associated with increased mortality (Lemiale et al, 2013).",
