The city also serves as home to more than 300 factories of the world's best 500 companies, including Microsoft, German software company SAP, and French car maker Groupe PSA.\n2\n In recent years, its monetary development has been recorded to have surpassed China's national growth, with a GDP growth of 7.8% in 2019\n2\n as against the national average of 6.1%.\n3\n After the spreading of the recent viral disease, numerous firms have now evacuated their expat workers from the city and temporarily halted business activities. The strict travel restrictions that have been enforced in Wuhan and different urban communities in Hubei are expected to have ripple effects throughout China and beyond, as far as trade is concerned. Among the industries that would be negatively impacted, retail, tourism, and hospitality sectors are likely to be most affected.\n4\n\n",

This impact is quite obvious in the rattled stock market.\n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n It is quite interesting how the lockdown of a province with a population just a bit less than that of France or the UK has threatened to be a blow to the global economy. This could be said to be amplified by the thorough integration of China, the second\u2010largest economy behind the US, with the rest of the world. During the SARS\u2010CoV outbreak in China from 2002 to 2003, the global economy was estimated to have lost roughly $40 billion.\n9\n Currently, as China has an economy 8 to 9 times larger than it had during the SARS epidemic, and is even more connected to the rest of the world, experts believe that the total impact of the 2019\u2010nCoV on global economy could be quite huge.\n4\n As China now contributes approximately 16.3% of the world's GDP, the country has been the main growth driver worldwide, with the IMF estimating that China alone accounted for 39% of global economic growth in 2019.\n10\n This implies that any slowdown in the nation's economy could likely send waves across the global economy.\n11\n Figure 1 presents the growth of China's GDP and its share of the global GDP from 2003 to 2018.",

These provinces equally supply auto\u2010parts to carmakers in the US, Europe, and South Korea. If the manufacturing companies remain idle until February 10, 2020, the experts believe that there could be production loss of about 350 000 units. This figure could skyrocket to over 1.7 million units if the outbreak situation continues until mid\u2010March, equating to about 32.3% decline from precrisis expectations.\n13\n Similarly, S&P believes the nation's auto\u2010parts production could suffer up to a 50% decline. Some carmakers have already expressed concerns over the shortage of car parts. Hyundai has reported the shutdown of its domestic factories after running out of parts from China. The managers of various carmakers in the US and Europe have also expressed concerns over the likely disruptions in business if China does not resume a full supply of parts to them within a week.\n14\n According to industry consultant LMC Automotive, China's auto market will shrink 3% to 5% in 2020 if the coronavirus outbreak continues into the second quarter.\n15\n\n",

Due to Chinese tours being canceled and a general recession in domestic and international travelers, Vietnam's tourist industry is expected to lose up to $7.7 billion in the first 3 months of this year.\n15\n As Chinese arrivals in Thailand are expected to decline by 80% in the first 4 months of 2020, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) estimates that the nation could loss $3.1 billion in revenue.\n18\n Aside Vietnam and Thailand, the tourism industries of Indonesia, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia, and many more countries across the world are expected to be hit by the outbreak.\n19\n\n",

A market diagnosis completed by Bloomberg economists, concludes that China's first\u2010quarter GDP growth may slip to 4.5% year\u2010on\u2010year. According to an estimated modelling by the same experts, to analyze the expected losses to different countries across the world, the global GDP is likely to decline by roughly 0.42% in first quarter of the year due to the outbreak. This is illustrated in Figure 2. That notwithstanding, the Bloomberg economists believe that it is too early to tell the full impact of the fatal disease since the infection has not attained its peak yet.\n20\n\n",
