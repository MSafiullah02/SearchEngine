Many such patients are cared for in the ICU and in turn become an infectious hazard for other vulnerable patients. Health care workers can acquire common viral infections from the community and spread them to susceptible patients in the ICU. Patients in neonatal (NICU) and paediatric (PICU) ICUs are most vulnerable because of the lack of prior immunity against many viruses circulating in the community. Recent improvements in diagnostic methods have enabled the rapid diagnosis and monitoring of many viral infections. Rapid and accurate typing of viral strains using a molecular technique can help identify the source of outbreaks. Also, specific postexposure prophylaxis and treatment are now available for many important nosocomial viral infections. In this chapter, we discuss some of the important viruses that could be associated with nosocomial infections in the ICU, according to their usual route of transmission (Table 20.1). Infection control measures recommended for preventing these viral infections are listed in Table 20.2.\n\n",

Annual seasonal outbreaks of influenza are caused by minor antigenic changes (antigenic drift) seen in influenza A and B viruses. Major changes in antigenic subtypes (antigenic shift) are only found in influenza A virus and typically involve the emergence of novel hemagglutinin (H) and/or neuraminidase (N) proteins on the viral envelope. Pandemic influenza occurs when a new influenza A strain emerges, to which the majority of the world\u2019s population has little or no immunity. There were three influenza pandemics in the last century, of which the pandemic in 1918 due to the H1N1 virus was the most severe. The first pandemic of this century occurred in 2009 [1] and was due to another H1N1 variant that emerged through a quadruple reassortment of viral RNAs derived from human, avian, Eurasian and North American swine influenza sources [2]. The presence of animal influenza subtypes, particularly avian influenza viruses such as H5N1, is of continuous concern, as these could be the source of future pandemics. Though with relatively high case-fatality rate, H5N1 avian influenza virus has so far only caused a limited number of human infections in restricted geographical locations with little evidence of human to human spread. However, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus proved to be a major burden for ICU staff [3].",

During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, children and young adults were more susceptible [4]. Overall fatality rate was <0.5%, but as many as 9\u201331% of hospitalised patients needed ICU admission [5]. Severe disease and high mortality rates were seen in pregnant women, patients with underlying medical pulmonary, cardiac, metabolic, neuromuscular illness and severe obesity, and those in whom the diagnosis and admission was delayed [6\u20138]. Respiratory failures could be caused by viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The virus is transmitted via droplets, and patients are infectious during the prodromal phase and up to 7 days after symptom onset. Rapid antigen detection from respiratory secretions is available, but this was found to be insensitive for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus [10]. More sensitive and specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods had to be used [11]. Due to the infection-control hazards of taking nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage, the use of throat and nasal swabs were advocated. A complete respiratory diagnostic workup needed to be performed to exclude other viral, bacterial and noninfectious causes. A single negative influenza PCR result on an upper respiratory sample did not definitively exclude the diagnosis [12]. In addition, other concurrent or secondary infections had to be considered. Protocols needed to be in place to ensure satisfactory triage of patients according to severity [13]. Early administration of specific neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oral doses of oseltamivir or inhalation zanamivir, seemed to be beneficial [14]. In more refractory cases, the off-license use of intravenously administered zanamivir or peramivir was tried. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was found to be useful in very severe cases [12].",

The diagnosis can be confirmed by ELISA, RT-PCR or electron microscopy of stool samples. Noroviruses are highly infectious and are usually transmitted by direct contact via the faecal\u2013oral route or via oropharyngeal exposure to aerosolised vomit. A number of outbreaks have recently been described in NICUs involving mainly premature neonates, some of whom developed necrotising enterocolitis. Neonates and immunocompromised patients can shed the virus for a prolonged time over months, which emphasises the need for rigorous adherence to effective infection control measures (Table 20.3). Additional measures such as increased hand hygiene and wiping of floors and incubators with agents active against caliciviruses have been proven to be particularly useful in controlling outbreaks in NICU wards [43].",

Nosocomial transmission of hepatitis A virus is well documented. An outbreak in an adult ICU (AICU) occurred as a result of inadequate precautions taken while handling bile of a patient not suspected of incubating hepatitis A [49]. Most other outbreaks occurred in PICUs or NICUs, with attack rates varying between 15 and 25%. Risk factors for outbreaks have been attributed to handling soiled bed pads, nappies or gowns of an index patient, failure to wash hands, and eating in the ICU. In the NICU, vertical transmission and blood transfusion have been implicated as the cause of infection in the index case. The effect of nosocomial hepatitis A infection varies from asymptomatic to classic presentation with acute hepatitis. Diagnosis is by serological detection of hepatitis-A-specific IgM. The use of molecular techniques such as RT-PCR can help identify early infection or in difficult cases, such as those with immunodeficiency. Sequencing of PCR products is useful in establishing epidemiological linkage during outbreaks. NHIG has been successfully used for postexposure prophylaxis to control outbreaks. There is now increasing evidence that hepatitis A vaccine can be used for prophylaxis if the contact occurs within 14 days from onset of illness in the index case [50].",

They are either zoonotic or arthropod-borne infections and are often endemic in certain parts of the world. They are often highly infectious through close contact with infected blood and body fluid and therefore pose a significant risk of hospital-acquired infection. As many patients with VHF present with shock and require vigorous supportive treatment, it is a potential problem in the ICU. The major viruses of nosocomial concern in this setting are Marburg, Ebola, Rift Valley fever, Lassa and Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (Table 20.7). The incubation period for these VHFs ranges from 3\u201321 days. Initial symptoms are often nonspecific but may eventually lead to haemorrhage and shock. Any febrile patient who has returned from an endemic area of one of the VHF agents or has a history of contact with cases suspected to have VHF within 3 weeks should be considered as at risk. However, malaria should always be excluded. A risk assessment needs to be performed, and any patient known or strongly suspected to be suffering from VHF should be admitted to a high-security infectious disease unit that is designed to manage these patients. While awaiting transfer to a secure unit, such patients should be placed in a negative-pressure room with strict source isolation. Specimens for patient management should be processed in a high-security laboratory designated for category 4 pathogens, and the aetiological agent established using PCR, serology and virus culture. All areas and materials in contact with infected patients should be autoclaved, incinerated or treated with hypochlorite (10,000 ppm of available chlorine). If the patient dies, the body should be placed in a sealable body bag sprayed or wiped with hypochlorite. Individuals who have been in contact with a case of VHF should be put under surveillance for 3 weeks. The successful i.v. use of ribavirin has been reported in some cases of VHFs (Lassa, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever and Hantaan). Apart from yellow fever, no vaccines are available.\n",
