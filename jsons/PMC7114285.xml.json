            "text": "Enveloped RNA viruses that cause human viral haemorrhagic fevers include mainly filo-, flavi-, bunya-, and arenaviruses (Paessler and Walker, 2013). These viruses are prevalent worldwide and infect people in areas with poor public health (Gonzalez et al., 2018). New World (NW) arenaviruses, such as Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MACV), Guanarito virus (GTOV), Sabia virus (SBAV), and Chapare virus (CHAPV), uninterruptedly break out in South American countries, such as Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Brazil (Gonzalez et al., 2007; McLay et al., 2014; Pontremoli et al., 2018). They asymptomatically reside in rodents but are highly pathogenic in humans after occasional infection through the skin, respiratory tract or gastrointestinal mucosa (Radoshitzky et al., 2008). Due to their high fatality rates, as high as ~30%, and limited prophylactics or therapeutics, they are identified as biosafety level (BSL) 4 pathogens in most countries, except that JUNV can be handled at BSL 3 lab in certain circumstances (Nunberg and York, 2012).",

As we know, an attenuated live-virus vaccine (Candid#1) licensed in Argentina markedly reduces the mortality rate of AHF (Maiztegui et al., 1998). Human immunoglobulin G (IgG) from convalescent individuals is currently the main therapeutic option for AHF, while the risk of viral transmission between humans and concern regarding a shortage of plasma may exist (Enria et al., 2008; Kenyon et al., 1990; Ruggiero et al., 1986). Hence, additional drugs are urgently needed.",

(2016), vaccine-elicited human mAbs discovered by Clark et al. (2018), and a series of mouse mAbs identified by our group (Pan et al., 2018). These mAbs target the envelope glycoprotein complex (GPC) for neutralization, which consists of trimeric noncovalently bound subunits: receptor recognition subunit glycoprotein 1 (GP1), membrane-fusion subunit glycoprotein 2 (GP2), and stable signal peptide (SSP) (Radoshitzky et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2016). Although one single-domain antibody targeting nucleoprotein was also reported to neutralize Candid#1 in vitro (Linero et al., 2018), most reported neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) for JUNV were demonstrated to target GP1. In addition to mAbs, polyclonal antibodies also play a role in combating JUNV infection. Polyclonal antibodies purified from DNA-immunized rabbits have been demonstrated to protect guinea pigs from a lethal JUNV challenge (Golden et al., 2016). In fact, horse antiserum-derived polyclonal antibodies that demonstrated good efficacy against infectious diseases caused by highly pathogenic agents, such as Ebola virus (Wang et al., 2018a; Zheng et al., 2016), West Nile virus (Cui et al., 2016), H5N1 influenza virus (Lu et al., 2006), severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (Lu et al., 2005), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Zhao et al., 2017), have been extensively reported.",

To achieve this goal, different immunogens and immunization strategies were first tested in mice and then in horses. Antisera prepared from horses vaccinated with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes bearing JUNV GP were subsequently demonstrated to contain abundant nAbs against JUNV. Then, total IgG was purified, and F(ab\u2019)2 was obtained by removing Fc from IgG by pepsin digestion. Specific IgG and F(ab\u2019)2 were prepared through affinity chromatography against recombinant JUNV GP1. Finally, the neutralizing activity was verified with both VSV pseudotypes bearing JUNV GP and recombinant VSV expressing JUNV GP along with four other pathogenic NW arenaviruses. Antibodies specific to GP1 were finally found to bind an important site, Asp123, on GP1. This study presents an efficient strategy to prepare horse nAbs against JUNV and provides a foundation for developing potential therapeutics for AHF.",

GP1-specific IgG and GP1-specific F(ab\u2019)2 were yielded one fiftieth of total IgG and total F(ab\u2019)2, respectively, through affinity chromatography against eukaryotic GP1.

After a set of PVNTs, the 50% and 80% inhibitory concentrations (IC50 and IC80) of these antibodies were obtained. As presented in Fig. 4B, the IC50 values of total IgG and total F(ab\u2019)2 were 13.9 and 7.7 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. GP1-specific IgG and GP1-specific F(ab\u2019)2 had lower IC50s than total IgG and total F(ab\u2019)2, which were 0.8 and 2.0 \u03bcg/ml, respectively.

Furthermore, residual IgG collected from the flow-through fractions of GP1-affinity chromatography hardly neutralized VSV pseudotypes bearing JUNV GP even at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml.

In comparison, residual IgG weakly bound to these peptides, reflecting little nonspecific binding. In fact, P5 overlapped with the neutralizing epitopes of GD01 reported by Mahmutovic et al. (2015) and with those of eOD01 reported by Zeltina et al. (2017) at Y122 and D123 on GP1 (Fig. 6B). To verify the importance of Y122 and D123 to neutralization with the GP1-specific antibodies prepared in our study, we employed both mutated peptides and GP1s as antigens in another two sets of ELISAs. As a result, mutations at Y122A, D123A, and both sites on P5 partially abolished the binding of antibodies to similar degrees (Fig. 6C). We further validated this result with recombinant GP1, and mutation at D123A and mutations at Y122A&D123A impaired the binding to GP1, while mutation at only Y122A did not (Fig. 6D). Thus, we speculated that Asp123 on P5 is an important site on GP1 for the binding of these GP1-specific nAbs.",

In our study, both antisera and JUNV GP1-specific IgG purified from antisera had some cross-neutralizing effect on the five NW clade B arenaviruses, although the results were only validated with VSV pseudotypes bearing arenaviral GPs, which may be different from those validated with actual viruses. Beyond that, the exact cross-neutralizing mechanism is not clear. As one clue, antisera produced by vaccinating horses with pseudovirus expressing GPC reacted with not only pseudovirus-expressed GPC but also with cell-expressed GPC. This result implies that antisera and JUNV GP1-specific IgG purified from antisera might target diversiform or flexible structures of GPC to work, thus escaping hinderance from tiny structural differences among the five viruses. Another clue may be that they bound the key site Asp123 on GP1, which is conserved across the five NW arenaviruses. Even so, studies on cross-nAbs for pathogenic NW arenaviruses are at an early stage and require further validation or exploration. Additionally, cross-neutralization against the five NW pathogenic arenaviruses remains a major challenge, and more attention should be paid to their structural similarities rather than their sequence similarities.",

Even so, some disadvantages limit the wide application of horse F(ab\u2019)2. As a fragment of full-length IgG, horse F(ab\u2019)2 cannot function through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and crystallisable receptor-mediated cross-presentation, which are contributed by Fc and are considered important in protection in vivo (Chung et al., 2006; Mehlhop et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2017). As a heterologous protein to human immune system, horse F(ab\u2019)2 may be susceptible to immune resistance, thus a large therapeutic dose should be administered when applied in clinic. However, horse antibodies advantageously have a multitarget mode of action, which differs from that of mAbs. Moreover, multitarget actions affect not only multiple epitopes of the same pathogen but also multiple epitopes of different pathogens, thus providing an irreplaceable advantage for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Despite of those, the horse F(ab\u2019)2 developed in our study, as a potential therapeutic under study, provides another possibility for AHF therapy.",

We vaccinated horses through multipoint injection with aluminium phosphate as an adjuvant while employing electroporation to vaccinate mice without adjuvant. Hence, we speculate that electroporation is a necessary means for using DNA immunization to stimulate the antibody response in horses. This conclusion is also confirmed by other reports (Grunwald and Ulbert, 2015; Saade and Petrovsky, 2012).",

            "text": "It is worth mentioning that the affinity chromatography method against GP1 employed in our study substantially enriched the neutralizing activities of the horse antibodies. Specifically, the neutralizing activity of GP1-specific IgG (IC50 = 0.8 \u03bcg/ml) was almost 17 fold higher than that of total IgG (IC50 = 13.9 \u03bcg/ml). Hence, we deem GP1 to be an important target of nAbs in horse antisera despite that the immunogen employed by our study possessed full-length GPC. Through peptide epitope mapping, we found that P121-135 was strongly bound by GP1-specific IgG and that Asp123 on GP1 was an important site for antibody binding. Even though P121-135 shows significant binding, there can be other potential highly reactive epitopes in GP1 which are not presented in the peptide mapping scheme. These findings further proved that GP1, as a receptor recognition subunit, is a pivotal target of nAbs for JUNV. Despite that, antibodies targeting GP2 or GP1/GP2 interface may also exist in the horse antisera prepared by our study. Actually, antibodies targeting GP1/GP2 interface for blocking structural rearrangements that are required for fusion, have been demonstrated effectively neutralize Lassa virus (Yu et al., 2016). Thus antibodies in horse antisera targeting more epitopes are worth to be further studied.",
