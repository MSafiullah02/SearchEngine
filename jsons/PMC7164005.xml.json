Thus, development of new anti\u2010SARS drug is urgently needed for the potential SARS re\u2010emergence. The relative conservation and essentialness in functionality of a particular gene are used as indicators to evaluate a drug target. On the basis of these criteria, helicase is a good target, being a relatively conserved protein in SARS\u2010CoV (e.g. a less variable protein compared to spike protein) and critical for viral replication [9]. Accordingly, the latter protein has been proposed as an attractive target for anti\u2010SARS research [10], in analogy with the promising results obtained for herpes simplex virus\u20101 [11, 12].",

Bananins are a class of compounds with a unique structural signature incorporating a trioxa\u2010adamantane moiety covalently bound to a pyridoxal derivative to add potential cytoprotective functionality [15]. Several parent adamantane derivatives are already used clinically [16, 17], although the antiviral activity of the newly developed bananin has not yet been investigated extensively. In vitro assays demonstrated that bananin effectively interferes with SARS\u2010CoV ATPase activity by inhibiting helicase activity. Furthermore, in a cell culture system of SARS\u2010CoV, bananin inhibited viral replication at a half maximal effective concentration of less than 10 \u03bcm and a concentration causing 50% of cell death of over 300 \u03bcm, suggesting that it represents a promising anti\u2010viral drug candidate [10]. To investigate bananin primary targets, bananin\u2010resistant viruses were selected by culturing SARS\u2010CoV (GZ50 strain; GenBank accession number AY304495) on fetal rhesus monkey kidney cell line FRhK\u20104 in the presence of high concentrations of this adamantine derivative. The half maximal effective concentration of bananin on these mutant viruses was demonstrated to be more than 50 \u03bcm. Mutations were found in helicase (S259L), membrane protein (A68V and R124W) and spike proteins (N479I). The trans\u2010expression of mutant helicase or membrane protein during wild\u2010type virus infection can rescue viral replication in the presence of bananin, demonstrating that the SARS\u2010CoV helicase and M proteins were effective drug targets [14].",

Of primary relevance is the fact that the S259L mutation in helicase is always present, as well as the A68V and R124W mutations in membrane protein. This finding initially suggested that the observed antiviral activity could arise from bananin interference on a hypothetical helicase\u2013membrane protein interaction, as in the case of the closely\u2010related coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus, where the replicase protein complex including helicase colocalizes with M in the endoplasmic reticulum\u2010Golgi intermediate compartment for virion packaging [18]. Thus, co\u2010immunofluorescense and co\u2010immunoprecipitation experiments were performed, although no evidence of helicase\u2013membrane protein interaction could be obtained (Doc. S1 and Fig. S1). Thus, the mechanisms of bananin activity have been ascribed to the binding of the small molecule to single viral proteins and, in particular, to those exhibiting mutations in the bananin resistant SARS\u2010CoV variants.",

In the case of SARS\u2010CoV spike protein sequence, Shannon\u2019s entropy (in the range from 0 for invariant to 1 for hypervariable protein sequence positions) reveals that the 479 position, where the N/I mutation is found, corresponds to a highly variable site. A Shannon\u2019s entropy value of 0.72 is obtained by retrieving all of the 92 complete sequences of SARS\u2010CoV spike protein present in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases. The fact that bananin does not target on SARS\u2010CoV entry (Doc. S1 and Fig. S2), suggests that no bananin\u2010related activity can be attributed to the N479I mutation.",

From a structural point of view, the A68V mutation, occurring in a predicted protein trans\u2010membrane region, should exhibit only a minor functional relevance. The case is different for the R124W mutation, which is outside the trans\u2010membrane segments, with the arginyl residue being very conserved in all the available related sequences. Thus, the zero Shannon\u2019s entropy value calculated for the totally invariant 124 position of the membrane protein sequence suggests some functional role for such R/W replacement. However, the absence of tertiary structure information for the SARS\u2010CoV membrane protein prevents further functional analysis of the R124W mutation.",

Of primary relevance is the fact that both S259 and L297 are predicted to be outside the surface regions where DNA binding, NTPase activity and dimerization occur. Moreover, it is interesting to note that L297, replaced by a phenylalanyl residue, is totally buried in the helicase structure, and that the conservative L/F substitution [20, 21] does not cause any major changes in the helicase core structure.",

This surface pocket, formed by N257 and I258 backbone atoms together with S259, D260 and E261 side chains in the wild\u2010type helicase (Fig. 2), reduces its volume from 253.45 to 211.40 \u00c53 upon S/L replacement.

Thus, it is apparent how surface pockets of native and S/L mutated helicases are differently filled by bananin because binding with the small molecule involves a larger molecular interface in the case of the former helicase.

Alternative mechanisms of bananin antiviral activity have to be found because its protein target at the 259 sequence position presents a fully exposed side chain, and hence only limited local conformational rearrangements should result from the S/L mutation. Moreover, the fact that this mutation site is very far from the active site suggests that S259 is located either in an allosteric site of the enzyme or in a critical position for the overall protein flexibility. The fact that the S259/L helicase mutant is fully active is consistent with the above hypothesis proposing that this amino acid substitution, which is critical for bananin binding, does not interfere in the interaction of the enzyme with its natural substrates. The presence of the leucyl side chain in the protein mutant appears to cause steric hindrance to bananin binding, leaving the traffic of water molecules in and out from the hydrophilic pocket almost unaffected. Removal of such water molecules upon bananin binding could reduce helicase flexibility, which a very critical feature for the activity of this class of enzymes [22].",

By structural homology with other helicase dimers and helicase\u2010DNA adducts (PDB ID codes 1UAA, 3PJR and 2IS1), the interface between SARS\u2010CoV helicase and DNA has also been predicted. The structure of bananin (i.e. 1\u2010[3\u2010hydroxy\u20105\u2010(hydroxymethyl)\u20102\u2010methyl\u20104\u2010pyridinyl]\u20102,8,9\u2010trioxaadamantane\u20103,5,7\u2010triol) was parameterized by using mopac2007 [27]. Volumes of the proposed bananin binding pocket of native and mutated SARS\u2010CoV helicases were measured using the online tool castp (http://cast.engr.uic.edu) [28]. adaptive poisson\u2013boltzmann solver software was used for evaluating the electrostatic properties of SARS\u2010CoV helicase [29]. Figures were prepared with pymol using pdb2pqr [30, 31].",

The autodock tool (adt) was used to optimize ligand and protein by adding polar hydrogens and loading Kollman united atoms charges, as well as to perform docking calculations. A grid box with dimensions 40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 58 points was constructed around the SARS\u2010CoV helicase S259 residue. All bond rotations and torsions for bananin were automatically set by the adt routine. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm procedure was employed and the docking runs were set to 250 and a maximum number of 2 500 000 energy evaluations. In the docking simulations, all the other parameters were set to defaults. The resulting orientations with rmsd \u2264 0.5 \u00c5 were clustered.",
