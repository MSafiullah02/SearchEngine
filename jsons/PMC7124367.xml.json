Interest has arisen with regard to F. tularensis as it has emerged in new locations, populations and settings, and increasingly figured in scientific research gauging its potential use in bioterrorism [7], [9]. The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) 2012 surveillance report refers a total of 891 confirmed cases of tularaemia in a number of European countries in 2010, with Sweden reporting the highest confirmed case rate, followed by Finland and Hungary [10]. Tularaemia is considered an unusual disease and the confirmed case rate in Europe has remained stable from 2006 to 2010. Recent outbreaks of tularaemia have occurred in several European countries, presented in Table 1\n, including the Czech Republic, Kosovo, Bulgaria, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Spain, Turkey, France and Norway [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Besides these outbreaks, sporadic case notifications have occurred in Austria, Estonia, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and the United Kingdom [10]. Although there are no reports of tularaemia for Denmark during this period, a confirmed case of the disease in a human was recorded there in 2003 [21]. In Portugal, the bacterium has been detected in the blood of an asymptomatic man and in a Dermacentor reticulatus tick by molecular methods [9].",

F. tularensis is the most common and pathogenic species and is formally divided into three subspecies with different pathogenicities and geographic distributions: tularensis, holarctica and mediasiatica. The species Francisella novicida is currently widely accepted as a fourth subspecies of F. tularensis\n[3], [4], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], as it shares with F. tularensis an average of 99.2% nucleotide identity over a 1.1 Mbp of genome sequence [4], [26], [27], [30]. However, some objections to the transfer of F. novicida to the subspecies rank of F. tularensis have been recorded, based on recent multiple genome sequencing results, which show divergent evolutions for F. tularensis and F. novicida populations. Therefore, separate species may be retained [32].",

Sub-population AI has been additionally sub-divided into groups AIa and AIb [3], [6], [30], [35]. The subspecies holarctica, related to milder forms of the disease and classified as Type B, occurs throughout the Northern Hemisphere [3], [22], [30], [33]. Human infection with AIb strains usually have a fulminant clinical progression and are associated with high mortality rates, in contrast with infections by AIa and AII strains or Type B tularaemia [25], [30], [35]. Recently, this subspecies has also been detected in Tasmania, Australia [36]. Subspecies mediasiatica presents a similar virulence to subspecies holarctica, but its geographic distribution is restricted so far to Central Asia [26], [33]. F. novicida is less virulent and has been isolated in North America, Australia and Thailand [3], [26], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [37].",

FLEs belong to a distinct phylogenetic clade from F. tularensis species [39]. The effect of FLEs, if any, on vector competency and in the transmission of F. tularensis by ticks is still unknown [6]. FLEs have a worldwide distribution and are vertically transmitted by hard and soft ticks of the genera Amblyomma, Dermacentor, Ixodes and Ornithodoros\n[39], [40], [41], [42]. FLEs have been detected in ticks in North America (Texas, California, Minnesota), Canada (Alberta) and European countries such as Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45]. Their pathogenicity to humans is undetermined. They have recently been detected in free-living small mammals in Europe, suggesting the possible transmission of some FLE types from ticks to small mammals, although, to date, attempts to demonstrate it have failed [39], [41], [42], [45], [46]. The phylogeographic distribution of F. tularensis is given in Fig. 1\n; the geographic locations where FLEs have been detected in ticks are also indicated.",

Still, few pathogens show the adaptability of F. tularensis to such a wide range of arthropod vectors capable of infection dissemination [6]. Arthropod found infected in nature include ticks of the genera Amblyomma, Dermacentor, Ixodes and Ornithodoros, mosquitoes of the genera Aedes, Culex, Anopheles and Ochlerotatus excrucians, and flies from the Tabanidae family (Tabanus spp., Chrisozona spp. and Chrisops spp.) [6], [22], [27], [49]. Nevertheless, vector competence has only been demonstrated in ticks of the genera Dermacentor\n[35]. Tick-borne transmission of F. tularensis usually results in sporadic cases, although occasional outbreaks have also been reported [6]. Although regarded as merely mechanical vectors, mosquitoes have been associated with widespread epidemics of tularaemia and are capable of transient disease transmission [6], [50]. Both ticks and mosquitoes may be infected in the larval phase. Transtadial transmission has been demonstrated in ticks although in mosquitoes evidences for transtadial transmission are only based in molecular methods [35], [50]. Although transovarial transmission of F. tularensis in ticks was reported [2], [6], [51], a recent study in Dermacentor variabilis has proved otherwise [52]. Despite dissemination to ovaries and then to the oocytes, the pathogen was not recovered from the subsequently hatched larvae. Tabanid flies are regarded as mechanical vectors for F. tularensis and the long-term survival of this bacterium does not occur in these arthropods [6].",

Differences in transmission patterns have also been recorded within the USA: in western states, both ticks and deer flies are considered to be important vectors of tular\u00e9mia, while in the east only ticks are considered relevant.

So far, this is in accordance with previous findings regarding the epidemiology characteristics of vector-borne tularaemia, suggesting that, in Portugal, mosquitoes have no role in the transmission of this disease. Ticks are thought to be the most important vectors of tularaemia in the majority of countries where tularaemia is endemic [53].

            "text": "Few pathogens show the adaptability of F. tularensis to varying vector, host and environmental conditions. Variations occur in local transmission cycles in association with differing ecologies. Both F. tularensis type A and type B are associated with different life cycles in which different animal hosts and arthropod vectors intervene [6]. Type A tularaemia is more commonly associated with the terrestrial cycle of the disease, with wild lagomorphs such as rabbits and hares acting as vertebrate hosts in which amplification of the agent occurs and where arthropods are disease-disseminating vectors [6], [22], [54], [57]. Type B tularaemia is more frequently associated with the aquatic cycle, although outbreaks of tick-borne tularaemia involving subspecies holarctica have been reported [2], [6], [57]. In this life cycle, F. tularensis circulates in rodents such as beavers, muskrats and voles, and can be introduced in water courses from animal carcasses [6], [22], [27], [54]. There is also evidence that F. tularensis can persist in water courses in association with amoebas [27], [49], [58]. Contaminated water can be the source of infection to humans, flies and mosquitoes [49]. An unusual waterborne outbreak of human tularaemia has been described in Spain associated with crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) caught in a contaminated freshwater stream. The crayfish acted as mechanical vectors, through mud- or water-contaminated carapaces, although the presence of F. tularensis in crayfish stomach and hepatopancreas could indicate their eventual role as hosts [51]. A diagrammatic representation of the terrestrial and aquatic cycles of tularaemia is shown in Fig. 2\n.",

Antigen-presenting cells (APC) such as macrophages or dendritic cells, appear to be the primary cell types targeted by the bacterium at the outset of infection [59]. The virulence of the bacterium is directly related to its capacity to replicate within the cytosol of infected cells [60]. F. tularensis clearly possesses several mechanisms by which it manipulates immunity. The bacterium evades detection at the point of entry in the host in three ways: (a) it has modified cell-surface structures that enable it to avoid interaction with host receptors that are associated with the induction of inflammation; (b) it targets cells that lack co-receptors which facilitate binding to receptors that might alert the host cell to invasion; (c) it utilises receptors that fail to initiate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [60].",

FPI encodes for a putative type VI secretion system [4], [8] and contains 19 genes that have been demonstrated as essential for intra-cellular growth and virulence [24]. Less virulent F. novicida presents only one copy of FPI in contrast with F. tularensis subspecies tularensis and holarctica that present two copies [4], [24]. Genes within the FPI are regulated by mglA [4]. Although current knowledge of the gene's functions is far from complete, this is one of the most active areas of Francisella research [8].",

Clinical signs include lethargy, dehydration and grossly enlarged cervical lymph nodes.

Still, as F. tularensis exhibits highly conserved genomic sequences among strains of diverse origin, genetic polymorphisms allowing for individual strain typing have been difficult to find [77]. As for other bacteria, more recent PCR-based techniques such as variable-number tandem repeats (VNTR), multiple-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) and short-tandem repeats (STR) typing have been successfully used for identification at the subspecies level and for molecular epidemiology purposes [54], [77], [80]. One of the most discriminatory methods for the molecular subtyping of F. tularensis is MLVA, which consists of a series of VNTR loci that are PCR amplified via flanking primer sites and examined for size variation [79]. One MLVA system designed for F. tularensis is based on polymorphisms of 25 VNTR loci, Ft-M1 to Ft-M25. This MLVA typing system has a greater discriminatory power when applied to a worldwide set of F. tularensis isolates and provides accurate classification at the subspecies level [77]. This MLVA system has recently been improved by redesigning the subset of the 25 previously identified VNTRs to produce a new optimised, multiplexed MLVA system with a similar level of discrimination but with fewer time and cost requirements [79]. Ten of the previously described VNTR loci were selected based on their discrimination ability within the subspecies: Ft-M02, Ft-M03, Ft-M04, Ft-M05, Ft-M06, Ft-M010, FT-M20, FT-M22, Ft-M23 and Ft-M24. Locus Ft-M20 was split into two loci, Ft-M20A (which contains the originally described 12 bp repeat and is polymorphic across subspecies) and Ft-M20B (which contains the insertion with its 15 bp repeat and varies only among type A.II and F. novicida isolates) [79].",

Chloramphenicol is effective but seldom the first choice due to its possible irreversible effects on haematopoiesis. Tetracyclines have been associated with high relapse rates on withdrawal. Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, have been shown to be highly effective in per os and are the best choice for uncomplicated tularaemia. Also, ciprofloxacin has proved suitable and effective in the treatment of tularaemia in children and pregnant women [4], [49]. In domestic animals, gentamicin, enrofloxacin, doxycycline and chloramphenicol are referred to as therapeutic options for dogs [55], [70]. In cats, there are reports of the use of doxycycline or enrofloxacin and amoxicilin-clavulanic acid as being beneficial in the early stages of the disease [81].",

            "text": "One focus of current research work in the USA and in Europe is to develop a vaccine for protection against F. tularensis intentional release [49]. The restricted efficacy of the LVS has fostered extensive research with a view to providing alternative vaccine formulations, including the exploration of different live and killed attenuated strains and immunogenic components to produce subunit vaccines [4], [82]. In view of its immunogenic antigens, an effort has been made to develop attenuated strains of SchuS4, a representative strain of Type A tularaemia, for vaccine production. In fact, between LVS and SchuS4 strains there are about 35 genes that encode for different protein sequences, whose functions are not well defined, and may represent important immunogenic antigens. Still, given the increased virulence of the SchuS4 strain, only a small number of bacteria should be required to generate effective protection against wild type F. tularensis\n[85]. A recently published study demonstrated that inoculation with low doses of specific attenuated mutants of the F. tularensis strain SchuS4 provided protection against parenteral and intranasal challenge with a fully virulent wild type SchuS4 strain [86]. This favours the role of T-cell memory response as a critical determinant of F. tularensis immunity, additionally to the humoral response. This feature is the basis of the challenges foreseen for vaccine development, aiming at identifying antigen determinants that elicit an effective cellular-mediated immune response [4], [82], [84], [85]. Cell-mediated immunity was found to persist three decades after tularaemia vaccination. A recent study sought to identify the T-cell responses present in immune individuals in order to characterise F. tularensis-specific immune response [84], [86]. The findings showed that the production of INF-\u03b3, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b2 and CD107a (lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 or LAMP-1) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells appeared to be a characteristic of protective immune responses and that a correlation exists between these parameters and immunity [84].",

The same factors are thought to be related to the emergence of tularaemia. Special concerns regarding this bacterium exist in relation to its high infectivity, and easy dispersion through aerosols and contaminated water, which make it a potential bioterrorism weapon. Also, tularaemia presents a wide geographic distribution and has recently emerged in new settings, particularly in Europe. In Portugal, an on-going research project on tularaemia aims to increase our knowledge about the disease, particularly its impact in this country, which is still poorly understood, in view of the fact that there is little information available to risk population and health professionals, with the result that there is a possible underestimation of prevalence in man and animals. To this regard, efforts have been made by the National Institute of Health to increase awareness of the disease among risk populations, particularly hunters and health professionals. In accordance with the preliminary results, on-going research will further identify and characterise F. tularensis circulating strains and develop molecular and typing methods with increased sensitivity, specificity and discriminatory power. The role of autochthon wild lagomorphs in the F. tularensis life cycle, their involvement in animal-to-human transmission and their suitability as tularaemia sentinels will be accessed. Moreover, considering the economic and social relevance of hunting-related activities in this country, with very few studies having acknowledged its relation to zoonotic disease transmission risks, research into infection in game species is of major importance.",

As with any zoonotic emergent disease, the role of wild and domestic animals in F. tularensis epidemiology needs to be further evaluated, in particular, those which may act as reservoirs. Other epidemiologic data such as the population dynamics of susceptible animals, particularly lagomorphs and rodents in Europe, should be part of surveillance programmes, as they are thought to be directly associated with disease transmission patterns. From a public health perspective, disease surveillance in animals is crucial in order to prevent and monitor human outbreaks, particularly in endemic areas, where contact between humans and wildlife reservoirs or vectors is likely. Although tularaemia is not regarded as a common disease, and there is little awareness of the disease among health authorities and practitioners, its eventual future impact as an emergent zoonosis should not be neglected.",
