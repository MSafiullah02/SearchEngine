As of March 30, 2020, over a third of the population in the United States were under \u201cstay at home\u201d orders given by state governors to protect the vulnerable and the unexposed. Unprecedented steps have been taken by governments globally to contain the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a rapidly spreading pandemic. This has resulted in more than 690,000 cases and over 33,000 deaths worldwide (Supplementary Table 1). The index case of the disease, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified more than 3 months ago. Since then, public health authorities worldwide have taken aggressive measures to blunt the exponential spread of this coronavirus. Furthermore, several nations, including Italy, Spain, and France, have imposed nationwide lockdown measures to enforce social distancing to further prevent the spread of COVID-19 in their respective countries.",

Observations made in health outcomes following the 1918 influenza pandemic have guided public health policy regarding these preventative measures. Importantly, during this pandemic, some U.S. cities chose more effective measures to address the spread of the disease, resulting in observable differences in mortality rates across the nation (1). Social distancing is an evidence-based practice to help prevent the transmission of pathogens that are known to spread from person to person within a 3\u20136 feet distance through respiratory droplets (2, 3). This practice requires individuals in a community to choose behaviors that increase the physical distance between themselves and others (infected, asymptomatic carriers, or non-infected). Social or physical distancing helps reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 and slows the incidence of the disease by reducing the opportunities for potential viral exposures. Furthermore, this is an excellent example of how integral the public health system and policies are to the proper function of medical and healthcare systems. Acting swiftly and mobilizing precautionary measures can substantially aid in flattening the disease incidence curve, thereby reducing the number of critically ill patients who will need medical treatment all at the same time. This, in turn, reduces the burden on the healthcare system that takes care of patients presenting with the most feared complication of COVID-19, i.e., severe bilateral pneumonia (4). This concept, now widely referred to as flattening the curve, gives critically ill patients a fighting chance to survive by obtaining life-saving supportive therapy in hospitals. This, therefore, significantly reduces the mortality rate (1). If the number of critically ill patients is higher than what can be accommodated in hospitals, many more patients will die due to the lack of life-saving medical attention.",

For example, on February 4, 2020, the Diamond Princess Cruise ship carrying 3,711 passengers and crew members reported 10 cases testing positive for COVID-19 after their 14-day voyage. As a response to this, the ship was quarantined for 14 days while docked off the coast of Japan. Following this quarantine period, a total of 634 cases reportedly tested positive for COVID-19, despite droplet precautions and social distancing principles practiced on board (7). In retrospect, public health officials acknowledge this was not the best practice implemented to contain COVID-19. Additionally, public health officials responded differently to the Grand Princess Cruise ship off the coast of Oakland, California, based on suspicions that the dramatically widespread transmission of fomites or COVID-19 aerosols may have been exacerbated by interconnected central ventilation between ship cabins (8). Public health officials removed all susceptible and unexposed passengers from this cruise ship, which resulted in a significantly lower number of COVID-19 cases (8).",

Once the number of COVID-19 positive cases surpassed 5,000, the government of Italy imposed a nationwide lockdown measure on March 9th (Supplementary Figure 3, solid black arrow). However, even after these measures were in place for over 2 weeks (dotted black arrow), the number of cases of COVID-19 continued to rise exponentially, surpassing 50,000 cases by March 22nd (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figures 2, 3). This may suggest that Italy responded far too late to implement preventative measures that could have flattened the curve. Or, this example may indicate that even amidst the aggressive precautionary measures taken to reduce droplet spread, other modes of transmission may have also occurred. These observations are not limited to just Italy. To date, many of the European nations are experiencing an exponential increase in the incidence rate of COVID-19 despite many stringent precautionary measures employed over the past several weeks (Supplementary Figure 3). These epidemiological observations in the rapid spread of the disease across nations practicing droplet precautions strongly suggest there may be other modes of disease transmission involved (Figure 1).",

Remaining longer in the environment may mean this coronavirus can easily transmit through indirect transmission routes. This can be either a certain level of airborne spread or vehicle-borne (fomites) transmission. Pathogens like influenza virus and rhinovirus that usually spread through respiratory droplets have some airborne transmission properties making it plausible that SARS-CoV-2 may have such characteristics as well (2, 15, 16). Coughing, sneezing, and talking can produce droplets of various sizes. Fluid mechanical principles show that exhaled droplets smaller than 10 \u03bcm can travel longer distances through air streams (17). Respiratory droplets <50 \u03bcm can also remain suspended in the air long enough to contaminate ventilation systems located over 12 feet from the source (18). With the ability to remain viable longer in the environment, SARS-CoV-2 likely transmits more than 6 feet in the air.",

There are ways to help prevent such spread. (1) First, it is essential to follow all droplet precautions including washing hands with soap or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer for 20\u201340 s, (2) protecting viral entry points, (3) covering one's mouth when coughing or sneezing, and (4) appropriate social/physical distancing. In addition, (5) continually disinfecting contact surfaces can eliminate the risk of fomite-based transmission. (6) Furthermore, to prevent the possible spread of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 infections, we will need to reevaluate the current recommendations of 6 feet of physical separation between individuals to possibly increasing it further. Also (7), infected hosts can help prevent the propagation of the virus by donning a face mask covering their mouth and nose to disrupt the airflow near the source. (8) CDC's latest recommendation that all individuals wear a cloth face mask addresses asymptomatic carriers, also known as silent spreaders, and will help protect susceptible hosts. Finally in areas at increased risk of COVID-19 transmission such as hospitals and patient care facilities, (9) appropriately fitted N95 respiratory (facemask), with other personal protective equipment (PPE) and (10) expanded use of special air handling and ventilation systems (e.g., AIIRs) need to be in place (19, 20). This can help contain and safely remove SARS-CoV-2 likely transmitted through aerosolization.",

First, it is transmitted person to person (direct contact) through respiratory droplets. These droplets can travel for distances 6 feet or less in air. Second, SARS-CoV-2 is likely transmitted through fomites (indirect contact) for the duration it is viable on environmental surfaces. Third, it is also likely transmitted through aerosols (indirect contact) for distances longer than 6 feet in the air. To establish an infection, SARS-CoV-2 needs to first reach an entry point (eyes, nose, or mouth) on a susceptible host.",
