Although the current knowledge may not be able to explain how plant derived small nucleic acids enter mammalian cells and survive the nuclease degradation within, plant-derived small RNAs have been successfully detected in mammalian cells and tissues (Chin et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2017) . Before we believe that regulation by small RNA occurs across phylogenetic kingdoms, three critical questions need to be answered: (1) What is the quantity of plant-derived small RNAs entering mammalian cells and tissues? (2) By which routes does entry occur? (3) What protects small RNAs from degradation after entry?",

Using a critical micelle concentration assay, small RNAs in the bencaosome were found to co-assemble with the lipid layers, suggesting that these small RNAs may be protected from degradation. A previous study reported that 2\u2032-O-methyl groups on small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can stabilize the siRNAs in serum without affecting their activity in mammalian RNA interference (Yu et al., 2005) .

The main instability of RNA comes from 2\u2032OH group in the ribose. It acts as a nucleophile, reacting with the adjacent phosphate and resulting in cleavage of the RNA backbone. Thus, the ribose or phosphodiester modifications are likely to impact the stability of RNA. Moreover, RNA backbone modifications can impact base-pairing affinity. For example, 2\u2032-O-methylnucleotides have been demonstrated to have elevated melting temperature of resulting duplex molecules (Majlessi et al., 1998) . Future studies are necessary to explore additional modifications that might protect sRNAs from nuclease degradation in cells.",

Bencaosomes with PGY-sRNA-6 inhibited poly(I:C) induced inflammation both in vitro and in vivo . HJT-sRNA-m7 was selected from anti-fibrotic herb HJT and targets three fibrotic genes simultaneously: alpha-SMA, fibronectin, and Collagen type III alpha 1 . The design from Mother Nature is fantastic: the bencaosome with HJT-sRNA-m7 improved lung fibrosis both in vitro and in vivo . Furthermore, RNAs resembling mi-croRNAs were identified in Ophiocordyceps sinensis, a renowned traditional Chinese medicine used to stimulate the immune system, decrease blood pressure and inhibit tumor growth . The target predictions of these microRNA-like RNAs and GO analysis have confirmed their functions . The large amounts of small RNAs we have consumed from plants over time may precisely regulate human gene expression, suggesting that the phrase \"You are what you eat\" may have scientific foundation. Further studies are necessary to discover sRNAs from herbs that target all human genes, so that a healthy balance of gene expression can be achieved. It appears that Mother Nature may have provided precise remedies for many human diseases.",

Although quite a few compounds have been shown to provide effective treatment, delivery remains an important hurdle since oligonucleotides do not enter cells by diffusion. In this issue, the bencaosome has been used as a novel therapeutic to deliver oligonucleotides to mice by oral administration, and showed marked treatment effects . By mimicking a decoctosome, the bencaosome could consist of synthetic lipids, sRNAs, chemicals, and proteins targeting different genes in combination to achieve an optimal therapeutic effect.

Her research is to elucidate molecular pathogenesis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome induced by RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV, Avian and Swine Influenza, and Ebola. Her group has also studied molecular mechanism of lung fibrosis, psychiatry and cancer. She has proposed a number of repurposing drugs after elucidation of disease molecular targets.
