This provided estimates of multivariate normally distributed random effects (under a logit link) at the host level and also residuals at the microbe level which have a multivariate Bernoulli distribution. Modelling of multivariate longitudinal data is frequently performed but in most cases the correlations between dependent variables are regarded as nuisance parameters which must be accounted for in order to estimate fixed effects accurately [21, 22] . However, in this study, they are the main focus of interest. One previous study has investigated separate levels of multivariate association in longitudinal binary data with a similar approach to that used here [23] . Estimated covariances of the random effects and their standard errors provide an indication of significance of the association between each pair of pathogens, at both the host and microbe levels. The models incorporated fixed effects to adjust for a quadratic dependence of log odds of carriage on age and also for seasonal effects. Patterns of co-occurrence were analysed separately in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children.

Similarly, a positive covariance will always equate to an OR of greater than 1.

Concurrent multiple bacterial infections may be more pathogenic than single infections. It has been suggested that the more persistent severe OM experienced by Aboriginal children compared with non-Aboriginal children may be related to simultaneous prolonged carriage of multiple OM pathogens in the nasopharynx of Aboriginal children [2] . Hence the host-level social and environmental factors giving a high force of infection must be addressed to reduce the concurrent carriage of pathogens in the URT and the resulting severe outcomes of OM in Aboriginal children. Environmental factors are also likely to contribute to the positive host-level association observed between rhinovirus and S. pneumoniae in Aboriginal children. At the host level, mucosal immune function may play an important role in preventing colonisation by potential pathogens [28, 29] .
