            "text": "Adenoviral (Ad) vectors possess many attributes that favor their use in gene therapy, particularly their high efficiency.1 One of the key limitations to the use of Ad vectors is the restricted tropism of the virus. Systemic administration of Ad vectors leads to gene expression mainly in the liver.2 Pulmonary gene transfer by Ad vectors via the vascular route has proven to be limited with respect to efficiency in part because of difficulty in assuring significant residence time in the lung and/or paucity of receptors for adenovirus on the endothelium. Two approaches have been proposed to overcome the problem of restricted tropism: one is to genetically modify Ad vectors to render them target cell-specific345 and the other one is to use bispecific conjugates to redirect Ad vectors to target cells.6789 Several groups have reported selective delivery of Ad vectors to various types of cells via genetic modifications of Ad vectors.345 Thus far, there is no successful report of targeted delivery of Ad vectors to pulmonary endothelium using this approach. The concept of targeted delivery of Ad vectors to pulmonary endothelium has been nicely demonstrated in a study by Reynolds et al8 using a bispecific antibody. The complexing of Ad vectors with a bispecific antibody to Ad vectors and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) leads to a significant improvement in the infection of endothelial cells that overexpress ACE receptors. Systemic administration of the complexed Ad vectors also leads to improvement in pulmonary gene transfer.8 More importantly, the enhancement in pulmonary gene transfer was associated with a decrease in gene expression in the liver, although the level of gene expression in the liver is still substantially higher than that in the lung.8 In this study, we have shown that pulmonary gene transfer by Ad vectors can also be significantly improved via preinjection of cationic liposomes followed by Ad vectors. This protocol, together with genetic modification of adenovirus, may prove to be useful for pulmonary gene transfer for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. This method may also be extended to pulmonary gene transfer using other types of viral vectors via the vascular route.",

Gene expression was assayed 3 days following the injection. When AdCMVLuc alone was used, the liver had the highest level of gene expression (Figure 1b). A low level of gene expression was found in the lung and other organs. There was about a 100 to 1000-fold difference in the level of gene expression between the liver and lung Figure 1b. Preinjection of cationic liposomes significantly improved gene expression in the lung. As shown in Figure 1a, increasing the amount of cationic liposomes from 0.3 to 0.9 \u03bcmol/mouse led to a steady increase in the level of gene expression in the lung. At the dose of 0.9 \u03bcmol DOTAP per mouse, a range of eight- to 40-fold increase in gene expression was observed in seven different experiments. Continuous increase in DOTAP dose was not associated with a further increase in gene expression in the lung. Interestingly, the improvement in gene expression in the lung was associated with a dramatic decrease in gene expression in the liver Figure 1b.",

No blue cells were observed in the lungs of mice treated with a control vector (AdCMVLuc) (Figure 5a). In contrast, there was localized gene expression throughout the distal lung of mice that received AdCMVLacZ Figure 5b. The primary loci of LacZ expression appeared to be the capillary endothelium located within the alveolar septum Figure 5b. No sign of inflammation was noticed in any of the lung sections examined. The cell type of transfected cells was further analyzed by anti-platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) immunofluorescence staining of lung sections of mice receiving cationic liposomes followed by AdCMVEGFP. PECAM is a transmembrane adhesion molecule expressed at high levels on endothelial cells. As shown in Figure 6a and b, EGFP signal was substantially co-localized with PECAM labeling, confirming that endothelial cells were the major cell type transfected.",

Recently Tan et al10 have extended these studies by showing that pulmonary gene transfer via sequential injection protocol is even more efficient than that via cationic liposome/DNA complexes. Moreover, the sequential injection protocol overcomes, at least partially, the CpG-related proinflammatory cytokine response that is associated with systemic administration of cationic liposome/DNA complexes. The mechanism of pulmonary gene transfer via sequential protocol is not clearly understood at present. It might be due to a transient slow-down of pulmonary microcirculation by preinjected liposomes, which allows for efficient interaction of subsequently injected DNA with the target cells (endothelial cells). The improved lung gene transfer by Ad vectors via the sequential protocol might be due to a similar mechanism. This was supported by the observation that more viral DNA was detected in lungs of mice that received sequential injection of cationic liposomes and Ad vectors than in lungs of mice that received Ad vectors alone Figure 7. The increased pulmonary uptake of Ad vectors may play an important role in improving the efficiency of gene expression in the lung. Ad vectors are likely to be taken up by endothelial cells in free form.",

However, mixing of AdCMVLuc with DOTAP:cholesterol liposomes had minimal effect on infection of cultured mouse lung endothelial cells (MLEC) despite an increased cellular uptake of Ad vectors (data not shown). At high doses, DOTAP:cholesterol liposomes inhibited infection of MLEC in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). Similarly, mixing of DOTAP:cholesterol liposomes with AdCMVLuc led to a decreased level of gene expression in the lung Figure 2. These differences might reflect the different cellular barriers in Ad-mediated infection in different cell types. MLEC might lack an efficient mechanism in mediating the release of Ad vectors into cytosol following cellular uptake of cationic lipid-complexed Ad vectors. Despite an improved cellular uptake, cationic lipids may inhibit the subsequent release of Ad vectors into cytosol, thus resulting in an overall decreased level of gene expression.

The advantages of our method lie in its simplicity. Cationic liposomes can be prepared in large quantities in a cost-effective manner. This protocol requires no modification of Ad vectors, therefore it can be used for different Ad vectors containing different therapeutic genes.

The size of liposomes was around 150 nm as measured by dynamic laser scattering using a Coulter N4SD particle sizer (Hialeah, FL, USA).",
