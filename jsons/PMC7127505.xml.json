Most of them use PCR as the base chemistry, but other forms of nucleic acid amplification are also available in a rapid cycle or \u201creal-time\u201d format. Traditional PCR, which in the distant past took days to accomplish, has often been supplanted by faster and more user-friendly rapid cycle or real-time PCR methods. These assays are performed in a closed system, in which both amplification and detection occur within the same reaction vessel. Opening of the vessel and further manipulation of the amplicon are unnecessary, which greatly minimizes the risk of amplicon contamination of the laboratory and significantly diminishes the possibility of subsequent false positive amplification results. Although many of these are laboratory-designed and verified assays, several have been submitted and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and many more are under development or in clinical trials.",

For example, one may use this type of approach for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, or Pneumocystis jiroveci from respiratory specimens.2, 3, 4 The technique is most advantageous for the rapid diagnosis of serious infections with microorganisms that are slow-growing, fastidious, or that cannot be cultivated in the routine laboratory. When multiple organisms cause similar or identical clinical manifestations, or an internal amplification control is desired, then a multiplex PCR reaction is needed (that is, two or more nucleic acid amplifications are performed in one assay). Multiplex assays that address the most likely causes of a particular disease (for example, community-acquired pneumonia or diarrhea) would be the most helpful and cost-effective way to diagnose the responsible pathogen in many instances. Multiplex assays have recently been developed for the viruses that cause meningitis, and two FDA-approved assays are available for the rapid detection of common respiratory viruses.5, 6\n",

            "text": "Post-amplification analysis represents the third category in which there has been, and we predict will continue to be, advances in diagnostic molecular microbiology. Post-amplification analysis consists of a variety of methods that involve additional amplicon processing or analysis, in order to obtain more information than is available from the amplification reaction alone. Post-amplification analysis allows more accurate identification or characterization of a microorganism, often to the species level. Methods include melt curve analysis, reverse hybridization, DNA sequencing, and microarray analysis. Melt curve analysis consists of differentiating amplified DNA products after real-time PCR based on the probe dissociation characteristics. In brief, amplicons from a PCR reaction that are detected as fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes that are not consumed by the reaction (such as FRET or Eclipse probes) may yield additional information based on melt curve analysis. Oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to their target sequence with 100% complementarity will have a particular dissociation or melt curve that may be analyzed by heating the reaction mixture while monitoring fluorescence. If any nucleotide polymorphisms exist at the probe hybridization site, then the melt curve will be shifted. There have been amplification assays and probes designed that will afford microorganism differentiation through post-amplification melt curve analysis. This type of analysis has been used to detect and differentiate M tuberculosis from non-tuberculous mycobacteria (Figure 1), and to distinguish the subtypes of herpes simplex virus (HSV). Whiley et al described an assay that detected both the BK and JC polyomaviruses but differentiated them from one another based on the unique melt curves generated.7 Post-amplification melt curve analysis may also be accomplished using nonspecific DNA binders like SYBR green, or more recently with newer modifications of these chemistries that afford high-resolution melt curve analysis without the need for an oligonucleotide probe.",

In brief, the amplicon is labeled and then applied to a nitrocellulose membrane strip that contains the probes for the microorganisms of interest; the amplicon will hybridize to the location on the nitrocellulose strip of the complementary probe. Thereafter, a chemical reaction demonstrates the location of the amplicon, and the identification of the microorganism of interest is thereby obtained. This technology has been used to detect common and unusual mycobacteria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes, and more frequent causes of fungal infections.8, 9, 10, 11\n",

The EIA tests vary widely in sensitivity (50%-99%) and specificity (70%-100%), depending on the study and the reference standard.22 Ticehurst et al showed the sensitivity of one EIA to be as low as 36% when they compared this test to the two-step diagnostic algorithm for Clostridium difficile\u2013associated disease (CDAD) consisting of a screening glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) by solid-phase EIA (C diff Check-60; Techlab, Blacksburg, VA), followed by a confirmatory cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assay (CCNA) for those specimens that test positive with the GDH assay. Sensitivity for screening GDH EIA was 96% with a negative predictive value of >99%. This approach rapidly screened out the negative specimens (75%-80% of samples); confirmatory testing was then performed on the remaining 20% by CCNA. Negative results could be reported on the same day, whereas the GDH-positive specimens had to be incubated for another 2 days before CCNA results could be finalized.23 Gilligan also found a low sensitivity of 59.5% for the Premier (Meridian Biosciences, Cincinnati, OH) toxin A and B EIA compared to the two-step diagnostic algorithm. The use of the screening GDH followed by CCNA enhanced the detection of C difficile\u2013positive specimens by 40% in this study.24\n",

Sensitivity and specificity of the BD assay were 83.6% and 98.2%, respectively, compared to toxigenic culture. Real time-PCR proved to be more sensitive than CCNA, which had 67.2% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity in detecting C difficile from fecal specimens.

Additional selectivity may be obtained through the incorporation of antibiotics.

The growth of MSSA is inhibited by the cefoxitin, whereas the MRSA grows as green-colored colonies. CHROMagar MRSA (CHROMagar Microbiology, Paris, France; BD Diagnostics, Erembodegem, Belgium) also contains cefoxitin but has a different chromogenic reaction that yields rose to mauve MRSA colonies. The sensitivities of these assays vary somewhat between media and incubation, but the specificities are uniformly high for 24 hours of incubation.16, 31, 32, 33 A comparison of two chromogenic media, MRSA ID (bioM\u00e9rieux, La Balme et Craponne, France) and CHROMagar MRSA, with oxacillin screening agar performed on swabs submitted for nasal screening, demonstrated sensitivities of 77% for MRSA ID and 73% for CHROMagar MRSA at 24 hours. Specificity was 98% for both media at 24 hours, but declined to 94% for MRSA ID and 90% for CHROMagar MRSA at 48 hours.34 The bacteria that caused false positives on the MRSA ID included Enterobacter sp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), whereas on CHROMagar MRSA they were streptococci, CoNS, and Corynebacterium spp. In general, an extended incubation for these chromogenic media results in increased sensitivity but decreased specificity at >24 hours for MRSA detection. Hence, some authors recommend additional confirmatory testing in the form of Gram stain and latex agglutination tests to improve specificities, especially if incubation times >24 hours are used.16, 34 It is also important to note that if this chromogenic media alone is used for MRSA screening, as many as 18% of the MRSA-colonized patients may be missed compared to real-time PCR.35\n",

A modification of culture methods, the microscopic-observation drug-susceptibility (MODS) assay, was recently described: broth cultures are performed in multiple wells and viewed daily under light microscopy at 40x magnification.46 The presence of cording is considered diagnostic for the presence of M tuberculosis in this assay. The sensitivity was 97.8% for MODS culture, 89% for automated mycobacterial culture, and 84% for culture using Lowenstein-Jensen medium. Importantly, the median times to culture positivity were 7 days, 13 days, and 26 days, respectively. When prospectively evaluated in Brazil and Honduras, this assay was proven to be suitable for these resource-limited areas that perform high-volume testing.47 The method is, however, quite labor-intensive and time-consuming for laboratory personnel.",

Although there have been some improvements in culture-based assays such as chromogenic media for S aureus and the MODS assay for M tuberculosis, the majority of the vanguard work has been related to molecular diagnostic methods. Many of these assays, which were first performed in sophisticated university or reference laboratories only, have been made user-friendly and are now utilized routinely in many clinical laboratories worldwide. Complex molecular diagnostics that use DNA sequencing and microarrays are available, but there are also significant efforts to make such assays easier to use and more reproducible so that they too may be implemented as diagnostic tools in more laboratories. The more widespread implementation of these and similar technologies will undoubtedly improve the laboratory-based diagnosis of infectious diseases.",
