            "text": "To the Editor T he application of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) continues to be controversial. As evidence increases in favor of NIV usage in this setting, the subpopulation of patients who might benefit NIV remains still elusive. As clinicians who daily encounter this dilemma, we would like to briefly critique the current approach in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that appears to undermine the role of NIV by recommending a low threshold for intubation. 1 Clinical Benefits of NIV The Large observational study to UNderstand the Global impact of Severe Acute respiratory FailurE (LUNG SAFE) study, a large multicenter study, demonstrated that there is no significant difference in intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital mortality rates of patients with ARDS receiving NIV or mechanical ventilation, when ARDS severity, demographic characteristics, and associated comorbidities of both treatment groups were matched. This study showed the rate of mortality and NIV failure in the NIV group correlated with the severity of the patient's respiratory failure. 2 An earlier multicenter study by Antonelli et al 3 showed that an early 1-hour NIV in ARDS patients on ICU admission could be helpful to clinically stratify them and avoid unnecessary intubation in more than half of the patient population.",

Cheung et al 4 studied the efficacy of NIV and the risk of disease transmission on 20 patients with positive serology for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus treated by NIV and 105 health providers taking care of these patients. None of 102 health care providers who did the serologic test showed positivity for SARS.",

            "text": "Although it is still early to speak of an atypical ARDS in COVID-19, results of the early observations are in this line. A higher level of pulmonary compliance and shunt fraction is seen in COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS compared to the expected levels of ARDS from other causes. 5 An early study from Wuhan, China, showed an recruitment to inflation ratio (R/I ratio) lower than 0.5 in >80% of COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS, suggesting a significantly poor pulmonary recruitability in COVID-19. 6 Disrupted vasoregulation due to vascular insult has been suggested to be the cornerstone of poor oxygenation in the early stages of ARDS in COVID-19. Thus, pursuing the common treatment approaches of applying high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may accentuate underlying microvascular injury and contribute to a worse outcome. 7 Until we learn more about the pathophysiology, it may be wise to apply intubation and mechanical ventilation at the earliest signs of NIV failure or initially in those patients in whom failure of NIV is highly predictable.",
