Of particular interest to our work is the identification and understanding of the fluxes of cytokines and chemokines produced during infections with viruses that cause haemorrhagic fevers in humans. Many of these viruses are thought to target and infect cells of the innate immune system (macrophages and dendritic cells) resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (reviewed by (Bray, 2005). Of the most highly pathogenic microorganisms studied, Ebola virus has received the major share of attention in part due to sampling and investigations during outbreaks, but also due to the availability of suitable animal models and high containment facilities in the USA. Thus, in human Ebola infection levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b1, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein (IP)-10, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b2 and RANTES (regulated on activation, normally T cell-expressed and -secreted) have been monitored, showing differences in levels compared to control patients as well as between survivors and non-survivors (Hutchinson and Rollin, 2007). In addition to these cytokines, levels of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-2, IL-4 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 have been assessed in Ebola-infected cynomolgus macaques (Hutchinson et al., 2001).",

This application can also be extended to determine responses post-vaccination or after drug therapy, especially when assessing novel interventions. Such work with highly pathogenic material has only been possible by performing down-stream assay work in high containment laboratories or by inactivating infectious material using gamma irradiation. Currently the practicalities of such down-stream assay work are difficult in the UK due to (i) a regulatory history of working with contained pathogens in biological safety cabinets, thereby using the concept of primary containment; and (ii) the consequential lack of amenable facilities including ready access to irradiation equipment. Additionally the availability of a contained (CL3/CL4) luminex reader presents difficulties: as there is an unknown risk of using of aligned lasers within microbiological safety cabinets and it is unclear what impact subsequent treatments with formaldehyde vapour during cabinet decontamination procedures will have. Thus, investigations into the role of many immunological processes associated with the pathogenesis of agents which require high containment (such as the viral haemorrhagic fever infections), necessitate an appropriate form of sample inactivation before such measurements are made.",

            "text": "One of the most simple and widely used methods to eradicate virus infectivity in samples is heat inactivation and this is often used in subsequent tests that require antibody detection. Although many viruses including the viral haemorrhagic fevers such as Lassa, Ebola and Marburg are inactivated by heating to 60 \u00b0C for 60 min (Mitchell and McCormick, 1984), cytokines are prone to heat degradation under these conditions so an alternative to allow measurement of these factors in clinical samples is required. Irradiation using gamma (\u03b3) rays (at approximately 5 \u00d7 106\n rad) is a suitable alternative which has been used to measure cytokines using the multiplex luminex analysis, (Hutchinson and Rollin, 2007). However, facilities for \u03b3 irradiation are not widely available and efficiencies of this treatment depend on the viral genome size, sera concentrations and the temperature of inactivation (Mahanty et al., 1999). Chemical inactivation of virus infectivity with formalin is another simple and routinely used method, but unfortunately such treatment alters cytokine and chemokine proteins so that their detection in immunoassays is impaired (Mahanty et al., 1999).",

This enabled data acquisition on the luminex-200\u2122 analyzer using normal methodologies of setting bead regions given by the suppliers. It was observed that formalin treatment did significantly alter the MFI readings, by reducing the intensities measured. This observation has also been seen in flow cytometry protocols, where formalin inactivation reduced MFI when cells were fixed prior (Maes et al., 2007) and after (McCarthy et al., 1994) staining with fluorescence antibodies. This effect of photobleaching by formalin has also been noted in cells fixed and mounted for immunofluorescent slide methodologies (Canete et al., 2001). The authors of this latter report suggest that an oxygen-scavenging solution may reduce the bleaching effect of fluorescent probes.

Treating the beads with formalin overnight allows for inactivation of any pathogenic material and also for the sterilisation of the plates surfaces for analysis outside of containment, e.g. by fumigation with formaldehyde vapour.

This observation is comparable to a study where inflammatory cytokines were measured by luminex analysis in supernatants inactivated with 0.2% and 2% paraformaldehyde prior to microbead staining. The results showed that with two cytokines of the five displayed (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10), responses were detected in the 2% paraformaldehyde-treated samples but not using the 0.2% concentration (Mahanty et al., 1999). Additionally, using 3% paraformaldehyde fixation for fluorescence in situ hybridisation resulted in cells with greater stability and integrity over time than fixation in 1% paraformaldehyde (Murrell-Bussell et al., 1998). Therefore, a higher concentration of formalin could be leading to an increased stability of the microbead that has bound with the cytokine and detector antibodies. However, future work with differing levels of formalin solution is warranted to investigate this observation further.",

It has been shown that concentrations as low as 1% formalin can completely inactivate CL4 filoviruses such as Ebola and Marburg within 1 hour of exposure (Kuhn, 2008). Treatment with formaldehyde solutions has been reported to be effective for a wide range of viruses used in CL3 and above facilities, including: the coronavirus that induces severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Darnell et al., 2004) and Hantaan virus (Kraus et al., 2005) with concentrations of 0.009% and 1% formaldehyde, respectively. Additionally, 2% formaldehyde has been proven to be efficient in inactivation of bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Schwebach et al., 2001). As well as being used for human samples, the fact that luminex analysis is now routinely available for non-human primate material (Giavedoni, 2005) will allow for the testing of parameters using this assay in this important animal model.",

Despite 0.37% (v/v) formaldehyde being used to inactivate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Lifson et al., 1986), temperature also exerts a critical effect. For example, using 1% paraformaldehyde solution it was shown that after 18 h of incubation at 4 \u00b0C HIV was still detectable, but by incubating at 37 \u00b0C all virus had been inactivated within 6 h (Aloisio and Nicholson, 1990).
