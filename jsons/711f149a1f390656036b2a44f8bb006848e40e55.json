We statistically analyzed the clinical symptoms and laboratory results of COVID-19 patients and explained the discharge rate and fatality rate with a single-arm meta-analysis. The available data of 1994 patients in 10 literatures were included in our study. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fever (88.5%), cough (68.6%), myalgia or fatigue (35.8%), expectoration (28.2%), and dyspnea (21.9%). Minor symptoms include headache or dizziness (12.1%), diarrhea (4.8%), nausea and vomiting (3.9%). The results of the laboratory showed that the lymphocytopenia (64.5%), increase of C-reactive protein (44.3%), increase of lactic dehydrogenase (28.3%), and leukocytopenia (29.4%) were more common. The results of single-arm meta-analysis showed that the male took a larger percentage in the gender distribution of COVID-19 patients 60% (95% CI [0.54, 0.65]), the discharge rate of COVID-19 patients was 52% (95% CI [0.34,0.70]), and the fatality rate was 5% (95% CI [0.01,0.11]).",

The results of the randomized effects model meta-analysis showed that the discharge rate of the COVID-19 patients was 52% (95% CI[0.34,0.70]) (Figure 2E). The sensitivity analysis (Supporting Information Materials) showed that none of the literature had significantly interfered with the results of this meta-analysis. A funnel plot was drawn to test the publication bias (Figure 2F). Publication bias test results: Egger's test (P = .104 > .1) indicated that there was no publication bias.4 | DISCUSSION This meta-analysis included the latest studies from December 2019 to March 2019 to analyze the clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus. Our study, which included 1994 patients, reflects the most recent data since the emergence of novel coronaviruses.Although all the studies were case studies and data of randomized controlled studies were lacking, most of our results had relatively low heterogeneity in terms of single-arm meta-analysis, and the sensitivity analysis also showed that the results were not affected by individual studies and there was no publication bias. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials are not necessarily superior to nonrandomized controlled trials in terms of the level of evidence.18 The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fever (88.5%), cough (68.6%), myalgia or fatigue (35.8%), expectoration (28.2%), dyspnea (21.9%). In addition to common respiratory symptoms, the symptoms of headache or dizziness (12.1%) diarrhea (4.8%), nausea, and vomiting (3.9%) were also obvious in some patients. Up to 30% of patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV) also have diarrhea.19 Moreover, MERS-COV was shown to survive in simulated fed gastrointestinal juice and have the ability to infect intestinal organoid models.20 A recent study showed that nCOV was detected in stool samples of patients with abdominal symptoms.21 Therefore, while paying great attention to patients with the respiratory system as the primary symptom, more attention should also be paid to patients with headaches, dizziness, diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Fecal samples should be tested to exclude a potential alternative route of transmission that is unknown at this stage,10 to minimize false negatives in the diagnosis. Laboratory results showed that lymphocytopenia (64.5%), increase of CRP (44.3%), increase of LDH (28.3%), and leukocytopenia (29.4%), were more common. Overall, all of them were consistent with respiratory virus infection. The lymphocytopenia could be used as a reference index in the diagnosis of new coronavirus infections in the clinic. Studies have shown that the levels of inflammatory cytokines may be related to the severity of the disease, 10,16 which is expected to be an indicator of the severity of the disease. The data provided are not comprehensive enough, and the laboratory result values in different studies are not uniform, more studies are needed to confirm whether relevant indicators can provide clinical help.",
