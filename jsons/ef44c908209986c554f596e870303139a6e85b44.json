            "text": "Acute respiratory infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children, especially in developing countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), acute respiratory infections account for approximately 20% of all deaths among children under 5 years [WHO, 2010] , and 70% of these deaths occur in Africa and Southeast Asia [Williams et al., 2002] . Viruses are a leading cause of acute respiratory infections with epidemiological variability that depends on the climate [Armstrong et al., 1999] . To date, most of the known data are based on studies with children and infants only [Choi et al., 2006; Costa et al., 2006; Kusel et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2006; Ord\u00e1s et al., 2006; Pierangeli et al., 2007] whereas the etiology remains largely undetermined for infections in the elderly [Fine et al., 1999; Garbino et al., 2002; File, 2003] . In children, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza viruses induce bronchiolitis, asthma exacerbation and pneumonia, leading to high rates of hospital admission [El-Hajje et al., 2008; Di Carlo et al., 2009] . Human rhinovirus, believed previously to cause only mild upper respiratory illnesses, has also been found in association with acute and chronic lower respiratory tract infections, including asthma exacerbations and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); although the role of human rhinovirus as a cause has only been established for asthma [Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Friedlander and Busse, 2005; Xatzipsalti et al., 2005; Pierangeli et al., 2007; Singh and Busse, 2007; Matthew et al., 2009] . It was reported that metapneumovirus accounted for approximately 5-10% of all acute respiratory infections in children and adults [van den Hoogen et al., 2001] whereas adenoviruses were responsible for 5-10% of acute respiratory infections only in children [Chen et al., 2004] . In addition, infections caused by other respiratory viruses such as parainfluenza viruses and coronaviruses occur worldwide. Furthermore, coronavirus NL63 [van der Hoek et al., 2004] , coronavirus HKU [Fouchier et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005] and bocavirus [Allander et al., 2007] are also responsible for acute respiratory infections in pediatric, elderly and immunosuppressed patients. Most studies based on laboratory diagnosis in hospitals are still restricted to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. On the other hand, emerging respiratory viruses have been a subject of concern because of the risk of rapid spread and high fatality rates due to lack of both diagnosis and effective antiviral therapy.",

            "text": "In 2004, surveillance for influenza viruses was expanded to India, as part of the global influenza surveillance network. However specific diagnosis which requires laboratory tests, were not widely available in eastern India. Hence the information on epidemiology and clinical features of respiratory virus infection in India is based entirely on research studies and the disease burden or seasonal prevalence of respiratory viruses remains largely undefined. This study initiated to complete the information on circulating respiratory viruses among patients attending the outpatients departments of different hospitals with acute respiratory infections in the eastern region of India during 2010 through 2011. During this surveillance, influenza B infection was found to be most prevalent followed by influenza A. In 2010, only influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulated whereas in 2011, only influenza A/H3N2 was found. This was in contrast with the previous report from eastern India, where higher prevalence of influenza A was observed compared to influenza B . Increased frequency of influenza B infection could be due to the post-pandemic effect of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 following which seasonal influenza A/H1N1 and influenza A/H3N2 viruses disappeared during 2009-2010. This is consistent with studies from Vietnam [Do et al., 2011] and other Asian countries [Mathisen et al., 2010] . Metapneumovirus has been associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children (3-13%) [van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Bosis et al., 2005; Gerna et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2006; Sarasini et al., 2006; Boivin et al., 2007] . During this study period, metapneumovirus was found in only 3% samples. This finding corroborates with reports from Canada, England and the USA, where the infection rate due to metapneumovirus varies from 2% to 4.5% [Stockton et al., 2002; Falsey et al., 2003; Boivin et al., 2004] , but is significantly less compared to the prevalence in Netherlands (10%), Australia (9.7%), and Chile (5.4%) [van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Luchsinger et al., 2005; Mackay et al., 2006] . Respiratory syncytial virus which is the most common etiological agent of viral lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children in the world caused 33.8 million new episodes in children <5 years of age [Nair et al., 2010] and is also associated with hospital admission of 3-9 per 1,000 children below 1 year [Pancer et al., 2011] . In Thailand alone, 417.1/100,000 incidences of pneumonia per year are attributed to respiratory syncytial virus [Olsen et al., 2010] . Worldwide, respiratory syncytial virus has been identified as the cause of 3.4 million cases of acute lower respiratory infections requiring hospital admission. Among all age groups, 7.1% cases were found positive for respiratory syncytial virus during 2010-2011 in this study. Following respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus-2 was the most predominant virus (6%) compared to parainfluenza virus-1, -3 or -4. Consistent with surveillance results during 2006-2009, in eastern India Roy et al., 2011] and in Bangladesh [Zaman et al., 2009] children under 5 years old were found to be most vulnerable to infections due to influenza B and influenza A (H3N2) viruses. Whereas, influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 affected adults and the elderly which is consistent with findings from other studies [Cauchemez et al., 2009; John and Moorthy, 2010; Mukherjee et al., 2010] . Similar to influenza viruses, metapneumovirus infection was also detected mainly in children (under 5 year of age), suggesting early acquisition of infection [van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2011; Zappa et al., 2011] . During 2007-2008, only 8.7% of respiratory syncytial virus infection was found among children [Agrawal et al., 2009b] ; whereas in the same geographical region, 13.7% samples were found to be positive for respiratory syncytial virus in children (under 5 years) during this study period (2010) (2011) . The higher prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus during this study period could be due to lower activity of influenza A viruses compared to the activity of influenza A viruses in 2007-2008 [Agrawal et al., 2009b] . Among children with acute respiratory infections, co-infection with one or more respiratory viruses has been observed [Bonzel et al., 2008; Canducci et al., 2008] which correlates with results of present study, where predominant mixed infections were observed only in children.",

            "text": "Unlike temperate countries where the prevalence of seasonal influenza may reach epidemic proportions during the winter months [John and Moorthy, 2010] , in tropical countries like India, year round circulation of strains has been reported, though the infection peaks during rainy season (June-September) [Agrawal et al., 2009a . There could be several factors such as socio-economic, environmental, education, overcrowding and other factors, which could affect the seasonal incidence and distribution of viral infections. In eastern India, influenza B was found to be prevalent after the monsoon season as well as in the winter months [Roy et al., 2011] , and influenza A viruses predominated during the monsoon (June-July) [Agrawal et al., 2009a; Mukherjee et al., 2010] . During 2010-2011 seasonal infection due to influenza A [influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 or influenza A/H3N2] correlated with previous reports. However the seasonal pattern of infection with respiratory syncytial virus during 2010-2011 was found to be different from the previous reports from Kolkata, India [Agrawal et al., 2009a,b] and Bangladesh [Huq et al., 1990] , where respiratory syncytial virus infection was found more commonly in the winter months or the dry seasons. Such variations in seasonal incidence are difficult to explain, as virus infection could be affected by a large number of different factors [Weber et al., 1998 ]. Previous studies in temperate climates showed that parainfluenza virus-1 and -2 infection occurs annually [Laurichesse et al., 1999; Karron and Collins, 2007] , parainfluenza virus-4 infection occurs twice-yearly during the late fall and winter [Aguilar et al., 2000; Vachon et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2009] and parainfluenza virus-3 infection occurs mainly during late spring and summer [Laurichesse et al., 1999] . These differences may be attributed to different geographical regions and study years. However, as the numbers of positive cases were very low in the present study, the seasonal prevalence of influenza C, parainfluenza viruses and human rhinovirus could not be determined. Hence large-scale studies over a broader geographical range and longer time period are required to understand the seasonal infection pattern of respiratory viruses in India.",
