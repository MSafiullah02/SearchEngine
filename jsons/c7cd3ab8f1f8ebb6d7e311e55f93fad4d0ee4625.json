These patients are immunosuppressed not only as a result of the immune defects associated with the underlying disease, but also because of the treatment regimens that generally further decrease the patient's resistance to infections. An intensive transfusion support with platelets, red cell concentrates, immunoglobulins, cytokines, and other drugs is necessary. Many patients also need antiemetic agents, nutritional support, pain medication, and, very often, venous catheters. All of these measures are considered supportive care and apply in a similar fashion to the high-dose treatment of solid tumors. Supportive care measures, along with the treatment and prophylaxis of infections, are discussed in this chapter. Transfusion support is discussed in Chapter 22.",

Neutropenia has been recognized as the major risk factor for development of opportunistic infection in patients with hematological malignancy or undergoing cancer chemotherapy. Bodey and colleagues studied the relationship between the neutrophil count and the development of severe infection in 52 patients treated for acute leukemia at the National Institutes of Health from 1959 to 1963 (1) . In the presence of severe neutropenia, defined as less than 100 cells/mm 3 , there were 43 episodes per 1000 d with a marked drop in infection rate as the neutrophil count rose. In addition, the risk of infection increased with increasing duration of neutropenia. This relationship between neutropenia and life-threatening infection has been reported by numerous investigators since the initial publication by Bodey et al. in 1966 (2,3) . The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) defines neutropenia as an absolute neutrophil count of less than 500 cells/mm 3 , or <1000 cells/mm 3 with a predicted decrease to less than 500 cells/mm 3 (4) . Although the risk of neutropenia has been recognized for more than 40 yr, other qualitative defects in humoral and/or cellular immunity may also increase the risk of infection with a variety of pathogens including bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. Examples include infections with encapsulated bacteria in patients with dysgammaglobulinemia due to underlying myeloma or infections due to cellular immune deficiency such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or cryptococcal meningitis in the patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma, and invasive aspergillosis or cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia in the leukemic patient with chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) on immunosuppressive therapy (5) . All of these patients may have a normal or elevated neutrophil count.",

This situation is consider an emergency and should lead to prompt evaluation and initiation of empirical antimicrobial treatment. Evaluation includes a thorough history and physical examination (4) . The history should include the nature and status of the underlying disease, chemotherapy received, other immunosuppressive drugs such as steroids, use of cytokines, and past and recent infections as well as previous procedures. Initial examination should assess all sites of possible infection. The profoundly neutropenic patient may have minimal signs or symptoms of inflammation with 50 to 75% of cases having no definable source of infection when fever develops. The clinician should carefully inspect the eyes, orophar-ynx, and skin (with particular attention to vascular catheter tunnel and exit sites, bone marrow aspirate sites, nails, and nailbeds) (2) . The perineal and perirectal areas are frequently missed but are critical areas to inspect initially and on a regular basis when fever persists. Evidence of perirectal or perianal infection in the neutropenic patient may require modification of initial empirical antimicrobial treatment. Surgical intervention may be warranted for drainage of developing abscess(es) (6) . It is also important to carefully inspect the scalp, as hair may hide evidence of infection.",

Cultures of blood and urine should be obtained, as these are the most common sites of microbiologically documented infection. A minimum total of two sets (aerobic and anaerobic) of blood cultures should be obtained for the initial evaluation. It has been recommended that, in addition to drawing one set of cultures from a peripheral venipuncture, one set of blood cultures should be obtained from each lumen in patients with central venous catheters. In this group of patients, it is often difficult to obtain peripheral venous access even for simple blood sampling. The need to routinely obtain cultures from the peripheral vein in cancer patients with central venous catheters, therefore, has often been questioned. In a recent retrospective review, DeJardin et al. found a high predictive value of negative blood cultures drawn from central venous catheters of febrile cancer patients (7) . These authors have suggested that peripheral venipuncture was thus not routinely required unless blood cultures from the central venous catheter were found to be positive. A routine chest radiograph should be performed to exclude or diagnose pneumonia. Performance of the chest radiograph, however, should not delay initiation of empirical antibacterial therapy immediately after cultures are obtained.",

In addition to blood and urine, cultures should be obtained from any other site(s) found on exam to be suspicious for possible focus of infection.

Biopsy specimens should then be sent for cytology and/or histopathology with special stains for microorganisms as well as culture for bacteria, fungi, and viruses (e.g., Herpes simplex and Varicella zoster). In the setting of diarrhea, stool culture for bacterial pathogens, screening for the presence of Clostridium difficile toxin, as well as evaluation for ova and parasites should be considered. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be obtained from a lumbar puncture (or Ommaya reservoir when present) in patients who have neurological symptoms or a change in mental status to diagnose meningitis. Bacterial surveillance cultures from the oropharynx, urine, and stool have been performed on a regular basis in neutropenic patients at a number of institutions. Although information obtained from these cultures may be valuable for epide-miological purposes, they are not recommended for the management of the individual patient. In the absence of specific signs or symptoms of infection, bacterial surveillance cultures have little value in predicting infection, rarely change antibiotic therapy, and are costly (2) .",

The sensitivity and specificity of this test may vary in different populations of patients (i.e., children versus adults, neutropenic versus non-neutropenic hosts) and therefore results must be taken in context with the clinical situation. \u03b2-glucan is another surrogate marker for invasive fungal infection and may apply to a broad group of pathogens that possess a high concentration of \u03b2-glucan in their cell wall (9-11).",

            "text": "A large array of pathogens is responsible for infections in immunosuppressed and/or neutropenic patients with hematological disorder. The source of infection may be from the normal endogenous flora or may result from nosocomial acquisition from the exogenous environment. Gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., and others) usually arise from the gastrointestinal tract and may cause serious infections in compromised patients. Antimicrobial developments in the 1980s and 1990s led to an increase in the armamentarium of antimicrobial agents available to treat these common Gram-negative pathogens (e.g., extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactams, carbapenems, quinolones) (2, 4) . Unfortunately, increased exposure to these agents empirically and prophylactically has led to the selection of Gram-negative pathogens with broad-spectrum antimicrobial resistance. Organisms with broad antibacterial resistance such as Acinetobacter anitratis and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia are usually acquired from the hospital environment (3, 12, 13) . The incidence of infection with Gram-positive cocci (Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphyloccocus aeurus, \u03b1-hemolytic such as Streptococcus mitis, and Enterococcus spp.) has increased over the last decade, and now accounts for the majority of microbiologically documented bacterial infections in the neutropenic host in many institutions (3, 12, 13) . Although the increased use of indwelling central venous silastic catheters has been considered to be the cause of the increase in Gram-positive bacteria infections, the oropharnynx and gastrointestinal tract are also considered sources of infection. Severe mucositis after intensive chemotherapy and the use of quinolone prophylaxis have been found to be independent risk factors that can increase the risk of \u03b1-hemolytic streptococcal sepsis. Bacteremia with \u03b1-streptococcus can lead to septic shock accompanied by adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), more commonly seen with Gramnegative rod bacteremia (14) . Approximately 10-20% of neutropenic patients with microbiologically documented bacterial infections are infected with anerobic bacteria (anaerobic streptococci, Clostridia spp., Bacteroides spp.) or mixed (Gram-positive, Gram-negative, aerobic, and/or anaerobic) infections.",

Patients with T-cell dysfunction caused by an underlying hematological disorder or its treatment may also be at increased risk for fungal infection. GVHD after allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation is a well-known risk factor for invasive mycosis that may last for months or years (15) (16) (17) . The use of monoclonal antibodies with anti-T-cell activity for treatment of lymphoproliferative malignancies or GVHD has been recognized as a risk factor for development of invasive fungal infections (18) . Candida albicans and Aspergillus spp. have accounted for the majority of invasive fungal infections in patients with hematological disorders. However, a shift toward the non-albicans Candida spp. and an increase of Aspergillus spp. as the major cause of fungal-related morbidity and mortality has been seen in many institutions (19) . In addition, infection with a wide variety of previously uncommon opportunistic fungal pathogens has been noted over the last two decades. These emerging pathogens include a number of septate filamentous fungi such as Fusarium spp. and Scedosporium spp. that may mimic Aspergillus spp. on microscopic inspection of tissues. Nonseptate filamentous fungal infections with Zygomycetes, previously considered a complication of uncontrolled diabetes, has been increasing reported in patients with hematological malignancies or after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Invasive infections with the dematiaceous molds, as well as a variety of yeast including the Trichosporon spp. have also been reported. It is important to be familiar with these potential pathogens, as they may have variable sensitivities or be frankly resistant to amphotericin B, the newer triazoles, and/or the echinocandins (20) .",

Other risk factors noted have been the use of oral vancomycin for the treatment of C. difficile-related enteritis, use of drugs with anaerobic activity, gastrointestinal procedures, mucositis, acute renal fail- ure, glucose intolerance, or diabetes (38) (39) (40) . Compared with the mean rate of growth of vancomycin-resistant isolates of enterococci reported to the NNIS database over the prior 5 yr, the rate of growth between 1998 and 2000 appeared to be decreasing (35, 36, 41) . It is hoped that this trend will continue as a result of both better infection control practices and more judicious use of vancomycin. Newer antimicrobials such as linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin have been developed for the treatment of VRE (42, 43) . Although the initial experience had suggested that linezolid might have more hematological side effects (especially thrombocytopenia) compared with the other antimicrobial agents, recent reports in both children and adults suggest that the toxicity profile is not worse than that of vancomycin (44, 45) . Even with these newer agents, however, resistant organisms have already been reported (46) . Most Gram-negative bacterial isolates from patients with hematological disorders remain sensitive to standard antibacterial agents. Patients will usually respond to appropriate therapy if there is eventual recovery from immune dysfunction. As with the Gram-positive bacteria, however, there has been a gradual increase in isolation of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative organisms like S. maltophilia (12) . These infections usually occur in the most complicated patients with uncontrolled malignancy, prolonged hospitalization, prolonged immune suppression, and multiple courses of prior antibiotic therapy.",

For patients not already receiving azole prophylaxis, fluconazole is the most commonly used antifungal agent for the systemic treatment of oropharyngeal candidiais. Typically, this infection is due to C. albicans, which is usually highly susceptible to treatment with fluconazole. In the unusual setting of oropharyngeal infection refractory to systemic therapy with fluconazole, documentation of persistent or recurrent fungal infection should be attempted. Treatment with a broader-spectrum antifungal agent that covers the non-albicans species of Candida would then be recommended. Broader-spectrum antifungal drugs would include amphotericin B, one of its lipid formulations, or an echinocandin. Although alternative triazole such as itraconazole or voriconazole could be considered, cross resistance between azoles has been seen among the non-albicans Candida spp.",

It may present as isolated candidemia, infection of a single organ (endocarditis or endophtalmitis), or wide-spread disseminated infection involving the liver and spleen (hepatosplenic candidiasis), kidneys, and/or other organs. Some clinicians will differentiate disseminated candidiasis into acute and chronic forms. Acute disseminated candidiasis is a syndrome of acute, life-threatening infection presenting as persistent fungemia, hypotension, and multi-organ failure in the neutropenic patient. Cutaneous and skeletal muscle involvement frequently occurs in the acute form of invasive candidiasis. In contrast, chronic disseminated candidiasis is established by hematogenous spread of infection during neutropenia. It is not accompanied by hypotension and frequently previous blood cultures failed to document fungemia prior to the patient manifesting signs and symptoms of infection. As marrow function recovers and neutropenia resolves, radiological manifestations of chronic infection are seen in the liver and spleen on ultrasound, CT, or most reliably on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient may have presented with persistent or new fevers, but may also have had minimal temperature elevations with anorexia, weight loss, or failure to thrive along with an isolated increase in alkaline phosphatase. This clinical presentation warrants further evaluation to rule out chronic disseminated fungal infection. Although frequently referred to as \"hepatosplenic candidiasis\" because of the radiological manifestations in the liver and spleen, this infection may be widely disseminated involving many other organs. Confirmation of the diagnosis of fungal infection with biopsy and culture of liver and/or other accessible lesions should be attempted in order to direct appropriate therapy. Although most of these infections are caused by Candida spp. disseminated infection with other bacterial, fungal, or protozoal pathogens may have similar clinical presentations (47, 48) .",

The need for routine removal of central venous silastic catheters (Hickman \u00ae and Broviac \u00ae [C.R. Bard, Inc.], etc.) for successful treatment of candidemia has therefore been controversial. Fungemia with certain species of Candida (e.g., C. parapsilosis) however is clearly felt to be linerelated, necessitating removal of the indwelling catheter. If the catheter is left in place and fungemia does not rapidly clear with appropriate antifungal therapy, the central line will need to be removed promptly. All patients with positive blood cultures for Candida spp. should be treated with an appropriate course of antifungal therapy regardless of immune status and whether or not the central line was removed (49, 50) .",

Historically, however, appropriate treatment for disseminated candidiasis consisted of prolonged treatment with amphotericin B, possibly combined with flucytosine.

The use of this azole has usually been reserved for the non-neutropenic patient and as follow-up therapy for patients responding to induction treatment with amphotericin B. Lipid formulations of amphotericin have been shown to be useful in patients with disseminated disease refractory to treatment with conventional amphotericin B and fluconazole (47) . A recent randomized trial comparing caspofungin with amphotericin B deoxycholate in the treatment of invasive candidiasis has shown the echinocandin to be equally efficacious and less toxic than the polyene in both neutropenic and nonneutropenic hosts (51) .",

            "text": "Infection with Aspergillus spp., once the second most-common fungal infection in immunocompromised hosts, is now the most common cause of mortality related to invasive fungal infections in the United States (19) . More than two decades ago, Gerson et al. showed that a prolonged severe neutropenia (>2 wk) led to an exponential rise in risk of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a group of patients with leukemia (52) . More recent studies have focused on the risk of invasive fungal infections in the allogeneic transplant recipient on immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD after marrow recovery (15, 53) . The most common site of invasive Aspergillus infection is the lungs. Infections can also involve the sinuses and other organs and expand in a locally destructive fashion. Pulmonary disease has a characteristic radiological appearance (round mass overlaid by a crescent of air) (8) and may result in catastrophic bleeding. On CT, a nodular lesion is typical and has a surrounding \"halo\" due to bleeding into the tissues. These lesions will frequently evolve as neutropenia resolves with contraction of tissue surrounded by a crescent of air (\"air crescent\" sign) (see Fig. 3.1A,B) . Although amphotericin B deoxycholate had been the drug of choice for invasive Aspergillus infections for four decades, overall response to treatment was poor in patients with underlying hematological disorders with most neutropenic patients dying of fungal disease (48, 53, 54) . Over the last decade, lipid formulations of amphotericin B have become available, allowing higher doses of drug to be delivered safely for longer periods of time (55) . Caspofungin was also found to be active in a retrospective trial of the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients refractory or intolerant to other standard antifungal therapy (mainly amphotericin B or its lipid formulations). A recent large, multinational, multi- institutional randomized clinical trial has led to a major change in the recommended standard therapy for invasive aspergillosis. In this trial, amphotericin B deoxycholate was compared prospectively to the newer triazole voriconazole in patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis. This study showed superior response rates and overall outcome in patients who began therapy with voriconazole as compared with those whose treatment was initiated with amphotericin B deoxycholate. This superior outcome was seen even when taking in to account a change to other licensed antifungal therapy, which in the case of amphotericin B deoxycholate, was most commonly a switch to a lipid formulation of amphotericin B because of toxicity. Moreover, the survival benefit with voriconazole was seen even in the neutropenic patient population and those who had received a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (56) . Although one must take into account the increased risk of drug-drug interactions, visual hallucinations, and photosensitivity of the skin not seen with the more narrow-spectrum agent fluconazole, voriconazole now appears to be the drug of choice for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in the immunocompromised host with a hematological disorder. Unfortunately, a large proportion of these patients were still considered nonresponders and no doubt died from complications of invasive aspergillosis. Although difficult to study in a randomized trial, most experts feel that surgical debridement, when possible, is beneficial in improving overall outcome in patients with invasive filamentous fungal infections like Aspergillus (54, 57) .",

In addition to a shift toward the non-albicans Candida spp. and an increase of Aspergillus spp. as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many centers, a wide variety of previously uncommon opportunistic fungal pathogens have been encountered over the last two decades (19) . These emerging pathogens include septate filamentous fungi such as Fusarium spp. that may be difficult to distinguish from Aspergillus spp. on microscopic inspection of tissues, along with an expanding group nonseptate Zygomycetes, the dematiaceous molds, as well as a variety of yeasts including the Trichosporon spp.. The increasing recognition of these isolates as causes of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in patients with hematological disorders mandates knowledge of the microbiology, epidemiology, and options for the prevention and treatment of these previous uncommon opportunistic pathogens (20) .",

If prolonged neutropenia (longer than 3-5 d) is expected, the patient should be housed in private rooms and strict hand washing should be observed. Potential sources of pathogens (e.g., fresh flowers) should be removed from the patient's room. Contact with infected patients should be avoided under all circumstances. For patients with more prolonged neutropenia, such as recipients of bone marrow grafts, special measures such as isolation in rooms with positive pressure and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration may reduce the risk of acquisition of aspergillus spores and the development of subsequent invasive aspergillosis (66) . The use of a total protective environment (TPE) with isolation of patients in a \"sterile\" room with HEPA filters and laminar air flow, a low-bacteria diet, topical antiseptics and washings, and the administration of oral nonresorbable antibiotics (colistin, neomycin, norfloxacin) and antifungal agents (amphotericin B, nystatin) in these high-risk patients led to the reduction in documented infections in some prospective randomized clinical trials. Unfortunately, the lack of a survival advantage has led to the decline in use of TPE in most centers, although many centers continue to use positive pressure and HEPA filtration.",

Numerous studies have focused on the use of oral absorbable antibiotics (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones, and others). The most commonly used agents utilized for antibacterial prophylaxis are the extended-spectrum fluoroquinolones. Although they may reduce the frequency of Gram-negative infections, they do not have significant enough activity to prevent breakthrough infections with Gram-positive organisms and may also lead to the development of resistant Gram-negative organisms. Oral antibiotics, therefore, should be reserved for certain high-risk situations. Antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole was shown to be highly effective in prevention of infections with Candida (mainly albicans species) in bone marrow transplant recipients in several randomized trials in the 1990s. Recent studies are focusing on the utility of newer broader-spectrum agents such as voriconazole and posaconazole in this high-risk group of patients. Unfortunately, like antibacterial therapy, when an effective therapy for one infection is found (e.g., Aspergillus), increased or \"breakthrough\" infection with resistant organisms may be seen (e.g., Zygomycetes).",

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is active as a prophylaxis of infections with P. carinii. (see Chapter 18) . Although aerosolized treatment with pentamidine and oral dapsone has been used, breakthrough infections have been seen. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therefore remains the prophylactic agent of choice. Such a prophylaxis is indicated in highrisk situations (e.g., bone marrow transplants, patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia under high-dose steroids). Antiviral prophylaxis with acyclovir was shown to be extremely effective in reduction of the morbidity due to mucositis exacerbated by infection with H. simplex after bone marrow transplant over two decades ago. Although many centers use acyclovir, valcyclovir, or famciclovir for prophylaxis against infection with V. zoster virus, the dose of drug needed is higher and the period of time required for adequate protection is much longer (e.g., 6-12 mo after a hematopoietic stem cell transplant) than that needed for prophylaxis against H. simplex. Many clinicians will, therefore, educate their patients, family members, and other caregivers regarding the early signs and symptoms of viral infection. Antiviral treatment for Varicella is then withheld until the earliest signs of infection are evident. This approach is only effective if therapy is begun within 48-72 h of the first sign of infection and may serve to reduce the risk of visceral dissemination, reducing the need for prolonged prophylaxis in high-risk patients. For CMV infections (see Chapter 18) , several drugs are active for prophylaxis (e.g., ganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir), but because of their toxicity profile, routine prophylactic use is not indicated. Prospective monitoring of blood for a positive signal for CMV antigen or by quantitative PCR is now standard of care for patients at high risk (i.e., allogeneic blood or marrow transplant recipients, patients receiving therapy with anti-CD52 antibody, etc.) for development of CMV-related disease (e.g., pneumonitis, hepatitis, cerebritis). Pre-emptive therapy with either ganciclovir or foscarnet is given in the presence of a positive signal for CMV to reduce the risk of progression to CMV disease and withheld in patients with a negative signal in attempt to avoid unwarranted drug toxicity. Recent and ongoing prophylactic studies of newer oral formulations of antiviral agents with activity against CMV (e.g., valganciclovir) are promising. The routine use of hyperimmuneglobulins as a means of antiviral prophylaxis, more common in past years, has fallen in to disfavor because of costs, toxicities, and the improvements in the use of pre-emptive antiviral therapy.",
