There are no studies regarding the role of complement system in Chandipura virus (CHPV) infection. The current study has investigated the role of complement pathways in the in vitro neutralization of CHPV in Vero E6 cells. Using normal human serum (NHS), heat-inactivated serum (HIS), human serum deficient of complement factor, respective reconstituted serum, assays like in vitro neutralization, real-time PCR, and flow cytometry-based tissue culture-based limited dose assay (TC-LDA) were carried out for assessing the activation of different complement pathways. NHS from 9/10 donors showed complement dependent neutralization, reduction in viral load and decrease in percentage of CHPV-positive cells compared to their HIS counterparts. EGTA or EDTA pretreatment experiments indicated that CHPV neutralization proceeds through the alternative pathway of the complement activation. Our data showed a strong dependence on C3 for the in vitro neutralization of CHPV. Disparity in CHPV neutralization levels between factor B-deficient and reconstituted sera could be attributed to amplification loop/\"tick-over\" mechanism. Assays using C3, C5, and C8 deficient sera indicated that complement-mediated CHPV neutralization and suppression of CHPV infectivity are primarily through C3 and C5, and not dependent on downstream complement factor C8. With no specific anti-viral treatment/vaccine against Chandipura, the current data, elucidating role of human complement system in the neutralization of CHPV, may help in designing effective therapeutics.",

            "text": "Chandipura virus (CHPV), belonging to family Rhabdoviridae, genus vesiculovirus, was discovered in Chandipura village, Nagpur region of India during an outbreak of febrile illness caused by dengue and chikungunya viruses in 1965 [1] . Since then, it has been responsible for several outbreaks in Andhra Pradesh in 2003 [2, 3] , Gujarat in 2004 [4] , Nagpur in 2007 [5] , and Odisha in 2009 [6] . It is one of the major causes of acute encephalitis in pediatric population in India [2] . Chandipura virus has a negative sense, singlestrand RNA genome of size 11 kb. Genome comprises of five proteins. Glycoprotein (G) enables virus absorption, assembly, and budding and, therefore, act as major antigenic determinant., matrix protein (M) responsible for cytotoxicity in infected cells, large protein (L) forms the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thereby acts as a catalytic subunit, Nucleocapsid protein (N) wraps the viral genome, forms template for virus transcription and phospho protein (P) acts as transcriptional activator [7] . Compared to other encephalitic viruses, CHPV-associated fatality occurs within 24 h of onset of illness [2, 6, 8] , leading to infrequent appearance of IgM antibodies to CHPV. Thus, the diagnosis is mainly dependent on the detection of the P gene of CHPV in viral RNA in the human clinical samples by RT-PCR [4] . IgG antibodies against G protein to CHPV are a marker of immunity/recovery from CHPV infection [9] .",

Complement activation plays an important role in viral pathogenesis [19] and could also serve to improve the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic vectors [19] . The complement cascade can be initiated through three main pathways (depending upon virus recognition): the classical pathway, lectin pathway, or alternative pathway [20] . The classical pathway is antibody dependent and is activated upon binding of C1q to antigen antibody complex on the surface of pathogen. The lectin pathway gets activated when carbohydrate patterns on pathogen, attached to serine proteases like Mannan-binding serine proteases (MASPs) associated with mannan-binding lectin (MBL) [21] , ficolins [22] .",

These three pathways converge on a central component C3, which is activated by cleavage into C3a and C3b. C3a serves as a potent anaphylatoxin to promote inflammation. C3b can bind covalently to viral components to aid in opsonization and phagocytosis. The association of C3b with components further downstream, such as C5 through C9, can lead to formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which is capable of lysing virus particles or infected cells [16, 24] . Progression of the complement cascade depends on the assembly of C3b with other cleavage products from C4, C2, and factor B to form the C3 convertase [25] , a protein complex which functions to amplify the signal by further cleavage of C3 molecules in feedbackloop. The alternative pathway C3 convertase complex consists of C3b together with a factor B cleavage product to make C3bBb and the classical/lectin pathway C3 convertase consists of C4 and C2 cleavage products to make C4b C2a.",

Total RNA was extracted after 24 h PI. CHPV RNA was quantitated by real-time RT-PCR. \"NHS + CHPV\" group shows significant inhibition in CHPV replication compared to mentioned groups. Results represent mean of three independent experiments with error bar representing standard deviations. Values are given as mean log 10 CHPV RNA copies/well. Overall, (p < 0.0001), NHS could high significantly suppress CHPV copies by 5 log10 (p = ***) in \"NHS + CHPV\" group compared to CHPV only group, whereas virus copies were comparable in \"HIS + CHPV\" and CHPV only groups (p = NS). The reduction in the CHPV copies was by 3 log10 (p = ***) when \"NHS + CHPV\" group was compared with \"HIS + CHPV\" group ( Fig. 2a) . At individual serum level (except for one serum), NHS could effectively suppress CHPV copies by 1-6 log10 in \"NHS + CHPV\" group compared to CHPV only group and by 1-6 log10 in \"HIS + CHPV\" group ( Fig. 2b) . CHPV viral load per well was determined by absolute quantification using standard curve method. In brief, a standard curve was generated by the amplification of serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed CHPV RNA (10 8 to 10 2 serial dilutions), followed by comparison of test sample with the standard curve and subsequent extrapolation. Viral loads were expressed as RNA copies per well. Detection limit of real-time PCR was 10 copies per reaction.",

Here, our data indicated that 9 out of 10 NHS (at 1:4 dilution) showed neutralizing activity against CHPV with reciprocal neutralization titres ranging from 2 to 16 and 7 out of 10 counterparts HIS did not neutralize CHPV at any dilutions ( Table 1 ), suggesting that the observed neutralization could be complement mediated as reported in VSV infection [46] . The observation was further supported by (1) real-time RT-PCR assay showing suppression of CHPV copies by 1 log10 in \"NHS + CHPV\" group compared to both CHPV only and \"HIS + CHPV\" groups ( Fig. 2a, b) . However, factors like antimicrobial peptides present in the serum could be attributed to the observed neutralization of CHPV for HIS1, HIS3 and to some extent for HIS10 (Fig. 2b) compared to their respective virus controls. Besides, in a biological system, all individuals may not behave in a similar manner in response to a pathogen. (2) Flow cytometry-based TC-LDA assay showed decrease of 18.25% and 23.08% in \"NHS7/ NHS8/NHS9 + CHPV\"-positive cells compared to CHPV only and \"HIS7/HIS8/HIS9 + CHPV\" groups ( Fig. 2d) , thus establishing the activation of complement system.",

Since EDTA chelates both Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, hence, it inhibits all the three pathways [25] , whereas EGTA chelates Ca2+ ions, has lower affinity for Mg2+ ions, and thus inhibits classical and lectin pathways, but does not affect the alternative pathway. The pleiotropic effects of EGTA, MgCl 2, and EDTA on the function of various pathways/proteins were ruled out using optimized concentrations, where by themselves they had no effect on the virus. Moreover, the concentrations of the chelators and Mg2+ ions used in the current study were much lower than the related published report [36] , where the authors had checked the pleiotropic effects of chelators on the integrity of host cells as well as the complement system. Pretreatment of NHS7/8/9 with 20 mM EDTA failed to show complement-mediated CHPV neutralization, whereas NHS7/8/9 pre-treated with 1 mM EGTA + 2 mM MgCl 2 showed a reciprocal neutralization titre of 4 ( Fig. 4a) , hereby suggesting the participation of alternative pathway. Similar results showing decrease in CHPV copies by 2 log10 in \"NHS7/8/9 pre-treated with EGTA + MgCl 2 \" group compared to \"NHS7/8/9 pre-treated with EDTA\" group as assessed by real-time PCR further confirmed that the observed neutralization is through the alternative pathwayof the complement system (Fig. 4b) .

The binding of factor B to C3b is Mg2+ dependent [50] and results in the cleavage of factor B into Ba and Bb. Bb combine to the hydrolyzed form of C3 to form C3 (H2O) Bb. Therefore, a constant level of C3b remains in human plasma during this process of self-defense and no pathogen recognition molecule participates in this pathway, and this phenomenon is known as \"tick-over\" [51] [52] [53] . The role and mechanisms of alternative pathway involvement were further explored using in vitro studies, where factor B-deficient human serum showed reciprocal neutralization titre of 4 that was amplified to 8 upon reconstitution with factor B. Reciprocal neutralization titre of 4 in factor B-deficient human serum could very well be attributed to an amplification loop/\"tick-over\" mechanism. Through the \"Tick-over \"mechanism, a steady level of C3b remains in human plasma even when pathogen is absent [51] [52] [53] and this leads to vigorous activation of alternative pathway upon pathogen recognition [54, 55] .

Since C8 is also one of the major constituents of the MAC, the effect of C5 and C8 depletion on CHPV neutralization and infectivity was examined. C5-depleted serum failed to exhibit any neutralizing activity against CHPV, but the same was restored when the physiological concentration of C5 was the same as NHS. Parallel evidence of decrease in CHPV infectivity (by real-time PCR) in reconstituted C5 suggested C5 as an essential factor for the in vitro neutralization of CHPV. C8-depleted serum by itself was capable of neutralizing CHPV (4 reciprocal neutralization titer), reconstituting C8 resulted in more effective in vitro neutralization of CHPV (8 reciprocal neutralizing titer) indicating that C8 is not essential for in vitro neutralization of CHPV. However, C8 enhanced neutralization of CHPV at low concentrations of serum (8 reciprocal neutralizing titer).",

            "text": "Several studies have reported that C3 activation results in virion lysis through MAC formation [59] [60] [61] , virion aggregation, opsonization and through activation product deposition on virus particle [62] . Initial studies on VSV have shown that C3b deposition on VSV hinders its attachment to host cell, thereby leading to virus neutralization [63] . Johnson et al. have reported that C3 upon activation by paramyxoviruses, mumps virus and simian virus gets aggravated and deposited on virion which leads to viral lysis [33] . Though C5 is the initiator of MAC formation, it can also directly participate in virus neutralization [44, 58] . In a similar line, C5 involvement but non-involvement of C8 and C9 in the CHPV neutralization of the current study probably denies MAC formation.",

Vero E-6 cells were infected with NHS7 + CHPV; HIS7 + CHPV; CHPV only (100 TCID 50, 24 hpi). Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and probedwith mouse polyclonal purified anti-CHPV antibody followed by anti-mouse Alexa Flour 680 and acquired in the APC channel of flow cytometer. CHPV-positive cells were gated in the P3 region, set on the basis of CHPV and cell controls in the assay. d Measurement of infectious CHPV by TC-LDA -NHS group shows substantial decrease in CHPV-positive cells percentage compared to other groups.
