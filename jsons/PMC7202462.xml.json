It was not officially announced as a human-to-human transmitted disease by the Chinese government until Jan 20, 2020. Prior to that, many local physicians noticed a new kind of pneumonia caused by an unknown pathogen and Ai Fen, known as the \u201cwhistle distributor\u201d, initiated the reporting procedure to the local contagious disease control agents. Other physicians, including the soon to be well-known whistle-blower, Dr. Li Wenliang, posted their concerns about SARS-like cases on WeChat, a Chinese social media and messaging application, but received administrative warnings and were summoned by local police. On Feb 7, 2020, Dr. Li WenLiang died from COVID-19 pneumonia. It has been reported that more than 3300 healthcare professionals contracted the Coronavirus while on duty, including at least 13 of them who lost their lives (https://www.businessinsider.com/healthcare-workers-getting-coronavirus-500-infected-2020-2). In addition, many more healthcare professionals have faced intense stressors leading to mental health crises.",

On Jan 23, 2020, a group of professionals formed a team whose mission was to help Chinese healthcare workers who were fighting the Coronavirus pandemic on the frontline.An early leading member quickly built a group on WeChat. The team grew quickly and the project began operation on Jan 24, 2020, the day after Wuhan was placed on lockdown.Further recruitment continued using the following criteria:Licensed Mental Health Professionals or qualified preliminarily licensed professionalsTraining and experience in CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), MI (Motivational Interviewing), and/or Crisis InterventionA model of interdisciplinary team was established, while the scope is defined as short term peer supportMembers signed up for shifts based on their own availability.Soon after the initiation of operation, the members elected a five-person committee to oversee daily administration issues in a timely manner.The volunteer group integrated professionals from different mental health disciplines based on the belief that their work would be more effective with diversified clinical experiences and trainings. This was derived from experiences from inpatient interdisciplinary team and ACT model.The group eventually included a total of 45 members, which included psychiatrists, psychologists, Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSW), Licensed Professional Counselors (LPC), Licensed Mental Health Counselors (LMHC) and Registered Nurses (RN). The majority of our members were located in the US, with several from Canada and Australia. One member was located in Wuhan.\n",

Most of our team members worked during the day and provided online psychological support primarily in the evening of their local time. Hours were reduced as the epidemic slowed down and eventually the project was closed.Due to the WeChat setting, once joining the group, one\u2019s avatar remained in the chat room till one left the group. There was no indication of one\u2019s status (if online or not), hence volunteers could not determine who might be a candidate for a private session. Hence, the strategy was that the volunteer would try to engage HCPs in the group setting, which contained 300 + members, then invited HCPs into a private chat after receiving some response. HCP could also contact a volunteer for a private chat.Members offered both individual and group support. We focused on engagement and general/group intervention in the group, then did individual intervention in private chats, which were shielded from the main group. Engaging the participants was the most challenging issue, especially at the beginning. This was due to following reasons:Culture unlike Western culture, traditional Chinese culture does not encourage complaining, which is considered a sign of weaknessTrust it takes time to establish rapport with strangersStigmatization toward mental health conditions: considered as \"weak\" or \"crazy\"Fear of government scrutiny or political repercussionBurn-out from overloaded workStrategies and tools used:Useful strategies of engagement:Healthcare workers from Wuhan could use an alias in order to conceal their real identities (volunteer group members used real names). They could communicate with texting or talking, instead of by face to faceVolunteers strived to provide a loving, caring, and relaxing environmentVolunteers intentionally offered a certain amount of self-disclosure to help participants become more familiar with their peersVolunteers coordinated, organized, and connected with local and national authorities to help the flow of information in an effort to get basic needs metVolunteers sent messages daily with the content that \u201cwe are here, we care, we are listening\u2026\u201dPsychological support tools:Self-care, including eating and sleeping hygieneMindfulness techniques to relax and manage emotionsActive listening, empathy, and validationMusic therapy, sharing literature, traveling stories, personal anecdotal, etc.Internal counseling and problem-solving among ourselves\n",

In addition, we have observed other changes that may be unique to this particular epidemic.Stage 1: BewildermentThis occurs in the very early stage of the epidemic. There have been significant uncertainties, lack of transparency, critical deviation of perception from actual facts, and even accusatory sanction toward clinicians who shared their suspicion of some forms of infectious respiratory disease emerging in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan (December 8th 2019 to January 19th 2020). Such measures had increased bewilderment in general population, more specifically in health care providers.Stage 2: ShockThis was a relatively brief, although it varies among individuals. The change from being rumor to verification of the COVID-19 infection occurred dramatically and reflected wrongdoing among certain provincial and municipal administration and authorities. With an abrupt decision to lock down Wuhan, an emotional shock was inevitable and lasted in various durations.Stage 3: AngerAnger exists throughout the following several stages, especially after Dr. Li, Wenliang's tragic death. People continued to demonstrate more anger when more medical providers and citizens succumbed to COVID-19. Healthcare professionals were upset that they were not informed about the truth, and many of them were not aware of the severity of the illness and did not or were unable to take full actions to protect themselves and their families.Stage 4: AnxietyThis stage lasts the longest and continued for the duration of this project. It included many worries:Concern about one\u2019s own safety when directly face patients with COVID-19. This was heightened by the scarcity of PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) at the beginning stage when there were frequent close contacts with patients and coworkers who were infected.Concern about one\u2019s own family members who might get infected and not receive adequate careConcern about family members\u2019 wellbeing, especially when there was extended separation due to work duties and/or quarantinesConcern about the unknown, this was a new illness with no established treatment guidelines or known treatmentConcern about healthcare system overload and ineffective managementConcern about the locking down of the cityConcern about the political repercussionStage 5: Burn outHospital systems were overloaded and malfunctioningWorking for long hours exacerbated by the lack of PPE. In order to preserve the limited supplies, doctors and nurses would choose not to eat or drink so that they did not have to get changed while using bathroom.Facing traumatic events, such as witnessing entire families die in succession after contracting the diseaseLimited availability of lodging, heating, water, and foodStage 6: DesperateThinking about giving up as a result of no prediction of end of the situationFeeling hopeless and helplessPassive death thoughts (rarely actual suicidal ideation)Fear of getting infected and dyingFeeling abandoned (especially at the beginning of lockdown and other special situations)Stage 7: AcceptanceRising to face the reality, elevating hope as progress occurred\u2014the entire nation was mobilized; the city and province changed leadership, new hospitals were built in stunning speed, and assistance from healthcare workers from other provinces arrived.Stage 8: HopeWith more resources pouring in from all around the nation, by February 25, 2020, over 42,000 healthcare workers from other provinces had arrived in Wuhan to help fight the epidemic.More effective procedures were put into place. With the growing number of recoveries, healthcare workers started to regain hope and confidence.Stage 9: RecoveryLife starts to get back to normal. Physical and mental symptoms are mitigated as the situation improved. Healthcare providers present as less anxious and depressed; many are more hopeful. They start to review what happened and plan for the future.Stage 10 (presumptive)Aftermath. Most people get back to baseline; however, some of them progressed into long-term mental illness, such as PTSD (Maunder et al. 2006).",

This is unlike the other crises such as earthquake or volcano eruption, which last for shorter periods of time and leaving people to deal primarily with the aftermath. Therefore, people are exposed to continuous loss and trauma for a long period of time. Second, our approach was novel. There is little research on the use of social media for crisis intervention, despite the growing popularity of social media among all age groups. A PubMed search using key word \u201ccrisis intervention\u201d and \u201csocial media\u201d only found one article (Bailey et al. 2018). Although there are quite few very recently published articles discussing the mental health consequences of COVID-19 for both general public (Dong et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020; Ho et al. 2020) and healthcare personnel (Lai et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2020), including other online mental health services or telehealth approaches in China (Liu et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020), but our practice model is unique. Finally, this was a grassroots international effort comprised of volunteers. This demonstrates the value of peer support, even when the peers are fellow professionals.",

Social media provided easy accessibility, and anonymity to HCPs, it reduced barriers and resistance and improved engagement. But, the clinical skill we utilize during routine work, such as interviewing and psychotherapy techniques, were not directly applied to this setting without adjustment and flexibility.",

We organized a group of active clinical mental health providers who were familiar with Chinese culture and were willing to voluntarily provide crisis peer-to-peer psychological support to the frontline healthcare providers in Wuhan. We utilized an existing social media platform. We found that it was, despite many challenges, an effective way to implement mental health support. This form of disaster outreach via social media requires further study for development and improvement in different settings. Nevertheless, in the time of COVID-19 pandemic, psychological support to the frontline responders and community is of paramount importance. Thus, we hope our work can shed some lights on effective mental health disaster outreach utilizing existing cyber technology to help workers fighting this unprecedented pandemic.",
