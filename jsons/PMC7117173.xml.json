Although experimental infection tests indicated that PCV1 was non-pathogenic (Tischer et al., 1986, Allan et al., 1995), serological surveys revealed a high prevalence of PCV1 antibodies in the swine population (Hines and Lukert, 1995, Tischer et al., 1995). Significant cross-reactivity between PCV1 and PCV2 antigens was demonstrated, but serological evaluation based on PCV1 alone underestimated the seroprevalence of PCV2 (Magar et al., 2000, Rodriguez-Arrioja et al., 2000). Thus, specific tools for serologic detection are essential to determine the prevalence of PCV2 infection and elucidate how PMWS develops. Testing for PCV2 antibodies in sera is now performed by indirect immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescence staining of PCV2-infected cell cultures (Balasch et al., 1999, Ellis et al., 1999). These tests are not PCV2-specific because of slight antigenic cross-reactivity between PCV2 and PCV1. Other tests recently developed with PCV2-specific monoclonal antibodies (Sala et al., 2000, Walker et al., 2000) use the PCV2 virus and involve specific preparation of the antigen. However, PCV2 is difficult to produce on cells, requiring treatment with d-glucosamine and successive passages of the cells.",

This peptide proved highly specific for PCV2, but the limited sensitivity of this ELISA was unsuitable for individual serodiagnosis. The present study used whole capsid protein for specific, sensitive serodiagnosis of PCV2 infection. An ORF2-based ELISA was developed using GST-fused antigen as well as GST alone, both of which are expressed in recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells. The specificity of this test was evaluated using PCV1 and PCV2 antisera as well as other antisera from different swine viruses. Diagnostic sensitivity (DSn) and specificity (DSp) were compared in this ELISA and an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA), using 322 sera from pigs of Brittany herds. Investigations of the current state of PCV2 seroprevalence in swine indicated that the percentages of PCV2 antibodies in different age categories from PMWS-affected or PMWS-free herds constituted a possible epidemiological indicator relative to the clinical symptoms of PMWS.",

As PCV2 is associated with PMWS, PCV2-specific diagnostic tools are necessary to elucidate the course of infection. To date, most serological studies have used PCV viral particles for detection of PCV2 infection. PCV2 antibodies are currently detected by indirect immunofluorescent or immunoperoxidase assays after PCV infection of culture cells, and serotyping is achieved by comparative analysis of the titers obtained in PCV2- and PCV1-infected cells (Labarque et al., 2000, Magar et al., 2000, Rodriguez-Arrioja et al., 2000). However, such assays are not only time-consuming, but also lack PCV2 specificity, owing to antigenic cross-reactivity between Rep proteins of the two strains. More recently, PCV2 viral particles in combination with specific PCV2 monoclonal antibodies were used to develop a competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) for specific detection of PCV2 antibodies (Walker et al., 2000, Sala et al., 2000). However this c-ELISA still required culturing of PCV-infected cells. An interesting feature of the indirect protein-based ELISA proposed in the present study is that the baculovirus expression system used for antigen production allows high yields.",

Moreover, antibodies to PCV2 have been detected several years before the onset of the disease (Magar et al., 2000, Rodriguez-Arrioja et al., 2000, Walker et al., 2000). These findings suggest that PCV2 infection does not necessarily results in PMWS. However, further serological surveys are needed to determine the dynamics of PCV2 infection in herds and its relation to PMWS. The availability of a specific, sensitive, suitable for different categories of animals and easy-to-use PCV2 serological method would allow us large-scale PCV2 serological diagnosis in herds. We therefore investigated PCV2 seroprevalence in the swine population.",

            "text": "PCV2 serological analysis conducted in eight breeding\u2013fattening farms in Brittany showed that almost all sows and finishing-fattening pigs were seropositive, irrespective of the presence or absence of clinical signs of PMWS. These results are concordant with those obtained in Belgium, Spain, the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, Canada and the USA. However, high PCV2 seroprevalence was observed at the beginning of fattening (11\u201313 weeks) and during fattening (16\u201317 weeks) in PMWS-affected herds (96 and 90%, respectively), as compared to more moderate seroprevalence for both categories in PMWS-free herds (53 and 54%, respectively). These observations were corroborated by analysis of the mean OD ratio for each category, which revealed a statistically significant difference, depending on the presence or absence of clinical symptoms (P<0.001), in pigs in the 11\u201313- and 16\u201317-week categories. These results strongly suggests that PCV2 infection appears in PMWS-free farms during the fattening phase, whereas that observed in affected farms appears during the post-weaning phase. Active PCV2 seroconversion seems to occur later in PMWS-free farms than in PMWS-affected farms. It is noteworthy that the results for one of the four PMWS-free farms gave a different profile, showing only slight seroprevalence for the 16\u201317-week category. This would seem to indicate that the period of passive immunity was longer in this herd. Other experimental works indicated that passive immunity can last up to 14 weeks (data not shown).",

Thirty-five percent of the animals exhibited active seroconversion at 13 weeks and 57% at 18 weeks, whereas 8% showed a decline in PCV2 antibodies up to 18 weeks. The results are totally corroborated by those of the transverse study. PCV2 seroprevalence was slight in the transverse study between 11 and 17 weeks, whereas the cohort study showed major active seroconversion at 18 weeks. No pigs seroconverted at 10 weeks. Thus, these two studies suggest that PCV2 infection appears later in pigs with no PMWS history, whereas infection develops early in PMWS-affected pigs. These results emphasize the importance of the period of passive immunity, which was apparently longer on PMWS-free farms and probably resulted in a later onset of PCV2 infection. These pigs would be more resistant to PCV2 and therefore less likely to show clinical signs of PMWS.",
