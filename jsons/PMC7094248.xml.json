            "text": "However, China had 1.65 million nurses by the end of 2008, which means, with a population of 1.3 billion, the country needs 5 million more nurses to catch up with the global standard. Although the country saw a large increase of 80 000 nurses in 2008, the number still cannot meet the demands for patient care.13 In July 2007, there was an investigation of 696 comprehensive Grade A hospitals in 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. In China, Grade A hospitals are the hospitals that provide high quality and specialized medical health care service to several districts and are responsible for the education of nurses in the baccalaureate, master's and doctoral programs, as well as research. According to the investigation, these hospitals all had a very low ratio of nurses to beds (about 0.38 to 1) which was far lower than in other countries. According to the World Health Statistics 2009, the nurses-to-beds ratio ranges from a low of 1.1 in the African Region to a high of 1.25 to 1 in the European region.14 In that investigation, ward nurses in China were expected to provide care for at least 10-14 patients. For some, this figure was > 30 patients to 1 nurse. Sixty-five percent of \u201cfirst line\u201d nurses worked > 10 hours every day.15 In 2005, the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China (MOH, PRC) published the Nursing Development Plan in China (2005-2010), expecting that the nursing vacancy rate would reach 50% of all health worker positions by 2010. By the end of 2008, the vacancy rate of nursing was 27%, which means that there are at least 1.4 million vacancies for registered nurses (RN) that need to be filled. In fact, the total number of health professional graduates\u2014including nurses, doctors, and dentists\u2014will only be approximately 0.9 million based on the number of entrants to the colleges and secondary schools. It is no doubt that China is in a state of serious imbalance between the demand and the supply for nurses.",

            "text": "At present, the reform of the health system in China, including innovations in the healthcare workforce, is still in process. Old and new systems exist in parallel in this particular era of reform, which leads to many unusual and inequitable practices. In China, nurses can be categorized into 2 kinds: formal employed nurses and contract supernumerary employed nurses (ie, temporary nurses). Most temporary nurses don't receive equal pay for equal work when compared to formal nurses. In a number of health institutions, a contract nurse earns half of the pay bonus of a formal nurse. As a result, many hospitals have reduced certain nurses' income by classifying them as temporary workers, which means they can pay them reduced salaries in order to cut costs. Additionally, in some hospitals, nurses employed by supernumerary contract cannot participate in continuing education, job promotions, and are not paid for public holidays.15 At the same time, hospital administrators in China are prone to hire more physicians than nurses because physicians are seen as a source of income generation related to surgeries and expensive medications.17 As a result, China has more physicians than nurses, which differs from most countries in the world. Table 1\ndepicts the nurse-to-physician ratio of the Western Pacific region (WPRO) as 1:4, which is the lowest of the 6 WHO regions. As a member of WPRO, the ratio in China (0.7) was far lower than the average level of even the WPRO.14 It is possible that the duties or responsibilities of nurses in China are different from nurses in other countries and could be a factor influencing the low ratio of nurses to physicians. Nurses are only permitted to do basic treatments, as the majority of nurses are not educated in higher academic degree programs but rather hold associate degrees and diplomas. In addition, patients often rely mostly on doctors in the traditional health system of China.",

Many nurses leave their posts in protest of a hospitals' poor working conditions, their own low socioeconomic and professional status, and poor job availability. As a result, hospital nurses who remain suffer from even heavier workloads and stress. In order to relieve the pressure on nurses, much of the patient care in hospitals is supplied by patients' relatives, or by unlicensed personnel, which obviously lowers the quality of nursing and subsequently threatens the safety of patients. Eventually, young women who would consider nursing, as well as dissatisfied nurses, seek other career opportunities, so it is expected that the shortage will worsen. It is reported that Shanghai has lost 13% of its nurses over the last 5 years.18 Among these nurses, 93% felt their job was too hard; 85% said the salary was too low; 84% felt that they were under too much pressure; and 81% complained about poor professional status.18\n",

Some believe this is due to poor labor planning, poor distribution of nurses, and imperfections in the healthcare system.19 Although jobs are always available in rural areas, the pay and working conditions are usually not attractive to many nurses. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Health of China, nurse density in urban areas is much higher than that in rural areas. There are 18.8 RNs per 10 000 population in urban cities and only 5.5 RNs per 10 000 population in rural areas. Hence, in rural China, the shortage is even worse (Table 2\n).20 The nurse distribution is also inequitable in regions with low incomes (Figure 1\n).20 Most RNs (713 421) work in eastern China with a highly developed economy. By contrast, there are many fewer RNs (only 36 477) in western China, which is also the poorest area in the country.20 Yet the unemployment rate in urban areas keeps increasing because many students with a diploma are denied by hospitals in urban and wealthy provinces, leading to a worsening imbalance and a waste of human resources. Sudhir Anand et al concluded these inequalities may also be associated with corresponding economic disparities (eg, between countries, between provinces, and between strata). 21\n",

Since the adoption of the Opening-Up policy in 1978 (the Chinese economic reform led by Deng Xiaoping which opened up the economy to whole world), great progress has been achieved in China.22 Economic improvements and well-coordinated public health initiatives have resulted in dramatic decreases in the rates of most infectious diseases, lower infant mortality, and a corresponding increase in longevity of Chinese people. However, it has also brought about great foreign challenge and competition, especially after China's entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. China, like other countries including India, the Philippines, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, becomes a major donor in this global nursing shortage as a result of its abundant supply and high unemployment rate for nurses. As discussed previously, many Chinese nurses are leaving the profession due to poor working conditions, low socioeconomic and professional status, and poor job availability. Others believe it is a good choice for them to move to developed countries in search of increased wages, better working conditions and continued educational opportunities. The average salary for entry-level nurses in some Chinese urban hospitals is equivalent to that of a janitor. By contrast, Chinese nurses can earn 30-50 times more if employed in the United States.23 As a result of China's very high level of unemployment and underemployment, these nurses are even being encouraged by the government to pursue international opportunities.",

On January 23, 2008, the \u201cNursing Act\u201d was signed by Premier Wen Jiabao to deal with major problems that existed in nursing. The head of the Office of Legislative Affairs claimed the primary objective for publishing occupational regulations was to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of nurses. The act is viewed as a milestone in the process of nursing development in China. The rights of nurses were stated explicitly and fell into 4 categories: (1) better wages, benefits, and social security rights; (2) health protection and healthcare services; (3) improved individual development opportunities, and (4) professional development. In addition, the provision of encouragement and reward for outstanding nurses was also specified in the Act.26 The premier hoped these provisions would inspire the enthusiasm of nurses, attract more talented people to the nursing profession, and improve the overall quality of life for Chinese nurses.",

The government also plans to expand the scope of community nursing which will generate more nursing jobs for nurses.27 Research conducted by the Ministry of Health predicted that 1.036 million vacancies must be filled to meet the need by 2015.25 On the other hand, the Ministry has also, in past years, urged hospitals to lower the nurse-to-bed ratio (ie, less beds per nurse) by listing it as an important factor for appraising work of hospitals. The Nursing Act required that the nurse-to-bed ratio should reach the national standard for all hospitals in 2010. Finally, in 2004, nursing was identified as a profession requiring high technical talent for increased health demands in China, which promoted nursing as a rewarding career choice. This news encouraged people to enter and remain in nursing careers, thus reducing the growing shortage.28\n",

            "text": "In the field of nursing education, the government has made a large investment to build sustainable nursing education infrastructures since higher education was revived in 1983. At present, the nursing education system in China includes diploma, associate degrees, baccalaureate and master's degrees, and doctoral programs. Over recent decades, there has been a massive expansion in the number of individuals admitted to medical, nursing, and other health-related education programs. Since 1998, the government has made a substantial effort to expand health professions education. From 1998-2007, the number of admissions to college level programs in medical and health-related fields expanded by 461% (increased from 1.1 million in 1998 to 6.1 million in 2007), while admissions to all junior technical schools in the same fields expanded by 94% (increased from 1.7 million in 1998 to 3.3 million in 2007). In the same period, the number of nurses grew by 27% (and by 7% for all health workers) (Figure 3\n). 20 Experts proposed that the average number of all nursing programs admissions should be about 150 000 annually from 2003-2010.25 By the year 2010, enrollment of nursing students from senior or junior schools will be reduced to 50%, while there will be a significant increase in the number of students of junior colleges or secondary technical schools by 30%, and an increase at the college level or above by 20%. In the past, most nurses were educated after they graduated from junior schools, but now the number of these programs are being gradually reduced. If that occurs, nurses with a diploma degree or above (ie, baccalaureate) will comprise > 30% of the nurses. In the third level hospitals, 50% of the nurses will have a diploma degree or above and, in the second level hospitals, 30% of the nurses will have a diploma degree or above.29 In China, the hospitals are divided into 3 levels according their function. Third level hospitals are Grade A hospitals, as described earlier. Second level hospitals are district hospitals that provide comprehensive medical and health care services to multiple communities and carry out some teaching and research activities. First level hospitals are community hospitals that directly provide primary healthcare services including disease prevention, medical care, health care and rehabilitation, to a certain population in the community. In addition, specialized nurse training has been an important goal of nursing education in recent years. Between 2005-2010, China also plans to develop programs to educate clinical nurse specialists (CNS) in the area of critical care nursing, organ transplant, operative nursing, nursing care of tumor patients, etc. However, in China, there is still much discussion about the level of education for the CNS program (i.e., bachelor or master's degree). According to the investigation of Shen Ning, 53% of nursing experts propose the CNS program should be at the bachelor degree level considering the actual situation of nursing in China.30\n",

In China, military nursing education is of top quality. For example, the first nursing doctoral program in China was opened in the Second Military Medical University. However, in the era of peace, the demand for nurses in the military is not very high. Therefore, these advanced and abundant nursing faculties and other resources are available in the military. Nursing programs for non-military service are also run in military medical schools. In addition, military faculty members are asked to give lectures in civilian universities. The students trained in military school are welcomed by hospitals, for they are not only proficient in clinical skills but also have a strong physical capability to deal with the heavy workload in nursing practice.",

However, it is a concern of some that the quality of these educational programs is often ignored by these agencies based on their economic interests. As a result, a higher education evaluation was initiated by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to improve the quality of education and to build a high quality, competent workforce. The entire process of the nursing educational program would be evaluated, and the outcome will be related to the funding received and discipline enforced if standards are not met.

Through collaborative models with other universities, nursing leaders in China are moving towards development of their own models that merge the uniqueness of Eastern philosophy with elements of Western models. Supported by the China Medical Board (CMB), the Program on Higher Education Degrees in China (POHNED) was created to train competent nursing faculty and leaders in order to achieve higher retention rates. The first graduate nursing program in China was developed in cooperation with Chiang Mai University in Thailand. The Chiang Mai faculty were the primary faculty and they mentored returning graduates of the Committee on Graduate Nursing Education program(COGNE). Students spent one semester at Chiang Mai University to concentrate on community health nursing and gerontology, while practical learning experiences related to clinical, teaching, and research were conducted in the student's home university. By remaining more closely connected to their home institutions with less disruption on daily life and their families, the program was highly successful with all graduates initially returning to their home institutions. The POHNED programs demonstrate a unique model of international collaboration between developed and developing countries to meet the challenges of nursing education yet retain indigenous culture and control.31\n",
