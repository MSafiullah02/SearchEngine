Without major investments, the effort has been to integrate existing resources, to implement tight links among national and supranational agencies and to make plans for their most ef fi cient involvement in case of need. The mainstay for the response to a biological attack is represented by the public health system, entrusted to Italy's national health service, centrally coordinated but put into action by the Regions. The emerging threat of emerging infectious diseases and of bioterrorism has shown the need for a change in the education curricula of sanitary professions and for speci fi c training of fi rst line operators. Speci fi c courses have been activated by universities and other bodies, but attendance has been limited by the lack of ad hoc funds.",

However, the speci fi c threat posed by biological agents (and chemical or nuclear weapons) dictates that the military apparatus be ready to face it, so it maintains specialized units for NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) defence, and a national centre for research and speci fi c training, which is done at the Nubich grounds, near Rieti. The centre runs courses for the personnel of all the armed forces, the national and local police corps, the Italian Red Cross, the fi remen, the SSN, and the railway and port authorities. The centre, which participates in international working groups, develops policies, procedures, and guidelines for the integrated response to NBCR emergencies. Although subsidiary, the role of the Army remains essential, on account of its logistics and the capacity to mobilize its manpower, including its specialized medical and engineer corps ( Fig. 13 .1 ). One particular unit, the 7th Regiment \"Cremona\", is fully dedicated to NBC defence; the regiment has specialized units for the delimitation of the affected area and for the decontamination of people and materials. Regarding the biological hazards, it is equipped with a mobile laboratory capable of molecular detection of biological agents, isolator tents, and ambulances.",

Human cases from animal contacts have declined so much that the basic public health curricula have given less and less attention to it, relegating anthrax to be dealt with in the occupational medicine courses. Still in the 1960s a standard treatise of hygiene [ 27 ] gave a full education of anthrax and its control. Sophomore medical students exercised with Bacillus anthracis culture, guinea pig inoculation, and post-mortem dissection. Veterinarians on the fi eld could perform the Ascoli reaction to diagnose anthrax in the carrions. And all provincial public health laboratories routinely tested for it, which in the Italian language had always been named carbonchio . In time, provincial health laboratories were dismantled, and slowly entire cohorts of MDs were formed who only had a cursory knowledge of carbonchio , even less of antrace, as the media started to call it.
