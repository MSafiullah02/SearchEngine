However, each country or state decides independently what mobility 2 restrictions to administer within its borders, while aiming to maximize its own citizens' welfare. 3 In turn, since individuals travel between countries and states, at least during periods when 4 quarantines are less restrictive, the policy in one country may ultimately affect the infection level 5 in other countries. Therefore, major questions are whether the policy dictated by a decentralized 6 government is efficient, and if not, how the governments can coordinate a better policy. Here, 7 we focus on the decision regarding the timing of releasing the quarantines. We consider a game 8 theory model in which each of two governments decides when to switch from a restrictive to a 9 non-restrictive quarantine and vice versa. We used parameter values driven by the literature and 10 publically available data. We show that, if travel is sufficiently frequent during the non-restrictive 11 quarantine periods, then the strategies are sub-optimal: Each governor tends to release the 12 quarantine sooner, which ultimately leads to longer periods of restrictive quarantines and a 13 higher prevalence of the disease. In turn, if the governments restrict international and interstate 14 travel to a low level even when the quarantines are non-restrictive, the policy dictated by the 15 decentralized governance may become optimal. 16 ",

While by multiple countries [14] [15] [16] , or independently by multiple states in countries like the U.S., or 23 even independently by multiple municipal authorities. Each governor is expected to dictate the 24 strategy that best serves her/his own citizens; however, in periods when the quarantines are less 25 restrictive, travelers can transmit the disease between countries, sates, and cities. Consequently, 26 the quarantine policy in one country/state may ultimately affect the outcome in other 27 countries/states. 28 Decentralized governance has a benefit: Each country or state may have a better knowledge of 29 its own citizens' lifestyle and needs and may dictate a policy that better suits its own citizens. 30 However, the decentralized policy also comes with a cost: Each government might ignore the 31 cost borne to citizens of other countries due to international and interstate travel. Accordingly, 32 various previous game theory studies have suggested that agents (individuals and countries) 33 under-invest in the prevention and control of diseases [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . 34 In this paper, we examine the case where each governor decides independently about the timing 35 of releasing the quarantine, and we ask what the inefficiency is due to such decentralized 36 governance. Namely, we examine how the strategy of different governments differ from the 37 socially optimal strategy of a hypothetical centralized government that aims to maximize the 38 welfare of all the citizens in all the countries (price of anarchy). Specifically, we consider two 39 countries/states, and we analyze the following three cases (Fig. 1 ) [14] [15] [16] 23] : (1) ",

(Even a restrictive 57 quarantine is not expected to eliminate the disease entirely, and min characterizes some minimal 58 infection level that persists in the population.) In turn, according to evidence showing that the 59 infection level may still increase under non-restrictive quarantine conditions [4, 15, 16, 25, 26] , 60 we assume that increases at a rate under a non-restrictive quarantine, where is country-61 specific and can be higher in those countries or states where interactions among individuals are 62 more frequent. Also, we assume that if a country is under a restrictive quarantine, there is no 63 travel from or to that country, whereas if two countries are both under a non-restrictive 64 quarantine, some individuals travel between these countries (we denote as the number of 65 individuals that reside in country but are in travel to country ). We describe in more detail the 66 dynamics of 1 and 2 in Methods: Dynamics of the infection levels. 67 In turn, the government in each country dictates the timing at which it switches from the non-68 restrictive quarantine to the restrictive one and vice versa. We assume that a government will 69 not allow the health system in its country to collapse [1] , and therefore, it will always switch to a 70 restrictive quarantine if approaches some maximum capacity, = max . .

This 92 result is consistent with previous results that suggested that agents under-invest in control of 93 diseases [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . In turn, notice that in both the optimal solution and the Nash equilibrium, the 94 governments tend to be coordinated in the sense that the second country to switch does so when 95 its infection level is similar to that of the other country (Fig. 2D ,F). 96 The difference between the optimal solution and the Nash equilibrium emerges if the number of 97 travelers between the authorities is above a certain threshold, in which case the price of anarchy 98 increases with the number of travelers (Fig. 3) . On the other hand, if the number of travelers is 99 below the threshold, the Nash equilibrium and the optimal solution are identical (Fig. 3) . This 100 suggests that one way to prevent the inefficiency due to the decentralized governance is to 101 declare in advance that travel will be restricted to a low level even when the quarantines are 102 non-restrictive. This may be applicable at the international scale, but much more difficult at the 103 municipal scale. 104 There are two mutually dependent reasons why decentralized governance results in releasing 105 the restrictive quarantine sooner. First, each governor ignores the damages that its own travelers 106 inflict on other countries, and thus, keeping a higher level of infection is perceived by the 107 governor as less costly. Second, as a consequence of the first reason, each country hosts more 108 infected travelers from the other country, and its own travelers are also hosted in countries with 109 higher infection levels. Consequently, if the infection level in a given country is low, it increases 110 rapidly due to travel, and therefore, it is not worthwhile for the country to reduce its infection 111 level beyond a certain value (where due to travel, this value may be lower than min ). 112 Finally, note that we have made numerous simplifying assumptions in our model, which suggests 113 various future directions for the examination of the consequences of relaxing these assumptions. 114 First, we considered only two types of quarantine, whereas in reality, more options are available. 115 In particular, governments can try to administer an intermediate level of quarantine that keeps 116 the infection at a constant level. Examining whether this policy is better than the ones that we 117 considered is beyond the scope of this paper (see [1] [2] [3] ); however, it is likely that a similar result 118 will hold: Decentralized governance might maintain a higher infection level than the optimum. 119 Second, we assumed that travel is allowed under non-restrictive quarantine. However, it would 120 be interesting to examine policies that also dictate how to best integrate the quarantine policy 121 with travel policy. Specifically, further restrictions on travel might mitigate the problem (Fig. 3) ; 122 however, it should be noted that restrictions on travel come with economic cost [13] . Third, we 123 considered only two countries, whereas considering more countries is generally expected to is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

Notice that some parameter values vary 218 significantly between countries and states, and therefore, we performed sensitivity analyses to 219 verify that the main results are general and hold within wider parameter ranges.Under restrictive quarantine conditions, a daily decline rate of 5% in the infection level after the 221 first two weeks is a reasonable estimate. For example, in China, the number of infected 222 individuals declined from ~86,000 to ~3,000 within 76 days, which implies 0 \u2248 \u22125% per day.In turn, in several countries, it took about 14-21 days before any decline occurred following a 224 quarantine, which suggests that considering delay \u2248 14 days is reasonable. Next, note that 225 depends on the restrictions used in a given non-restrictive quarantine, and it may vary between 226 states and countries. We used estimates that reflect the weeks before a restrictive quarantine 227 was administered in countries in Europe, where 5% \u2264 \u2264 15% per day is a reasonable",
