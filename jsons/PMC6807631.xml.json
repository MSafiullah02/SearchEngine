After the first case of influenza pdm2009 in Thailand was reported, the virus spread rapidly throughout the country. The symptoms of influenza pdm2009 were fever, cough, sore throat, and myalgia. During the epidemic, there were some patients who had similar clinical symptoms but were not infected by the influenza pdm2009 virus. Thus, influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) was used to describe a clinical syndrome that may be attributed to influenza and others respiratory viruses. ILI is caused by many viruses, including influenza virus, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and parainfluenza viruses 1. Hombrouck et al. reported that during the epidemic of influenza pdm2009 virus in Belgium, ILI in children aged <5 years was caused by influenza viruses (25%), RSV (19%), rhinovirus (17%), hMPV (9%), and parainfluenza viruses (7%; 2). When patients were infected by these viruses, there were some overlapping symptoms that rendered clinical diagnosis unreliable.",

(2004) and Wang et al. (2008; 11, 35). One sample (JQ745075) had tryptophan substitution for cysteine conserved position 156 (related to NL/00/01 position), which has not been found previously. The effect of amino acid change might involve structure of F gene which affect neutralizing antibody response. The amino acid change position 156 should be studied further. Variation in the fusion domain allows us to differentiate genotype A from genotype B but not subgenotype. Many factors influence circulation of hMPV, such as antigenic variability, viral infectivity, and immunity. Our study reveals that genetic variability of F gene is less heterogeneous; thus, the preexisting immune response can control viral infection. Further investigation of A2 genotype is needed because Vicente et al. (2006) have found that genotype A is more pathogenic than genotype B, which results in greater clinical severity in children 14. There are still discrepant reports about the relationship between the subtype of hMPV and disease severity, and further study should be performed.",
