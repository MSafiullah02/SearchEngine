In Brazil, epidemics of the diseases transmitted by Ae. aegypti, i.e. dengue, chikungunya and Zika, have been responsible for significant human and economic losses, and led the authorities to formulate strategies to attempt to increase vector control [1]. In 2015 and 2016, an annual average of 1,586,155 probable cases of dengue were recorded in Brazil; although a reduction to 252,054 cases was observed in 2017 [2], which could be the result of the cross-herd immunity to Zika virus [3]. The differential diagnosis of these diseases is difficult because of the similarity of symptoms, cross-reactivity, co-circulation and overlap of infections by different arbovirus species and strains [4, 5]",

Epidemiological studies have clearly associated the expansion of these diseases with haphazard and unplanned urban development processes, mainly caused by the lack of infrastructure and basic sanitation in areas that have been occupied without prior planning. In north-east Brazil, the population has been disproportionately affected by arboviruses, with 94% of all cases of congenital Zika syndrome being reported in this region [2, 6, 7]. Poor access to garbage collection and an intermittent water supply provide conditions for vector breeding, which in turn makes vector control more difficult in this region [3].",

Software is used to generate a list of starting blocks and subsequent blocks are selected according to a sampling interval. In each selected block, endemic disease control agents (ACEs) survey an average of 25 houses per day, targeting every fifth house on a street (i.e. 20% of properties).

These indices may facilitate understanding of the ecology of vectors in a given control area, but they also serve as useful measures for determining the success of intervention strategies [11, 14]. In Brazil, data for the calculation of infestation indices is collected on a bimonthly basis according to PNCD guidelines [12].

Spatial autocorrelation (association) measurements and tests can be differentiated by the range or scale of analysis, as distinguished from global and local measures [24]. A global measure implies that all elements in the matrix W are included in the spatial correlation calculation, producing a spatial autocorrelation value for any spatial weight matrix. In contrast, local measures are concentrated, i.e. they evaluate the autocorrelation associated with one particular area or a few area units rather than all of them [24].",
