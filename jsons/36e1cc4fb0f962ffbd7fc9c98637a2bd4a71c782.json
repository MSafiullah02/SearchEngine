This virus is responsible of a clinical condition, defined as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a clinical spectrum from mild respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms to interstitial pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, possible multi-organ failure and death (2). COVID-19 severity directly correlates with patient's age and presence of comorbidities (3). Pro-inflammatory cytokines may play an important role, especially in the more severe form of COVID-19. As a consequence, patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy might be to some extent protected from the SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complications (4). Indeed, COVID-19 has not been described in solid organ transplant recipients so far (5). Current AASLD recommendations acknowledge that post-transplant immunosuppression",

Thirty-four (5.3%) patients experienced a flu-like syndrome, complicated by bronchitis or bacterial pneumonia in 6, all recovered with antibiotic therapy.

The different populations investigated by the two groups could explain the disparities: our cohort in Milano concerns only adult patients, while D'Antiga's cohort in Bergamo mainly included pediatric transplanted patients. Results may also be affected also by the different time frames in the two reports. However, both studies showed that transplant settings may differ from the general population, possibly in regards to a high degree of surveillance at individual patient level and a milder disease expression which could be related to immune-suppressed status of liver transplant patients. Notably, all patients with COVID-19 live in Lombardy (Supplementary Figure 1), the region with the highest prevalence of infection in Italy: 10 million inhabitants with 63.094 ascertained infected people and 11.608 virus-related deaths.",
