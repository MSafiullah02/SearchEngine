Thus, livestock diseases may be responsible for negative social, economic and environmental impacts, at different levels (locally, nationally, regionally and internationally). Hence, the introduction of a new livestock disease not only has an impact on animal health, but also affects international trade, food supply and, if zoonotic, human health (Food & Agricultural Organization, 2018).",

Noteworthy, examples of (re\u2010)emerging animal diseases are the foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in the United Kingdom in 2001 (Knowles, Samuel, Davies, Kitching, & Donaldson, 2001) and in Japan in 2010 (Muroga et al., 2012) and the continuing outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) since 2003\u20132004 around the world (Elbers et al., 2004), the Bluetongue epidemic in Western Europe (Carpenter, Wilson, & Mellor, 2009; Wilson & Mellor, 2009) and the newly identified Schmallenberg disease in Germany in 2011, which has further spread to other parts of Europe, like the Netherlands, Belgium and Northern Ireland (Afonso et al., 2014; Anonimous, 2013). Also, in 2016, cases of HPAI were reported to the OIE from different European member states including Belgium (World Organisation for Animal Health, 2018). Another very important recent emerging livestock disease reported specifically in Belgium at the end of 2018 was African swine fever, although cases so far have been reported only in wild boars (Linden et al., 2019). Its emergence is of great concern for the pig industry of the region and being a disease, which until now has been exotic for Belgium. It shows how diseases may re\u2010emerge unexpectedly with most likely origin attributable to human activity (Saegerman, 2018).",

The joint presence of these drivers can create an environment in which infectious disease can (re\u2010)emerge and be maintained in animal and/or human compartments (King, 2004). Many drivers have been identified, such as climate change, global travel, immigration patterns, increase in the human population, environmental degradation and others (Altizer, Ostfeld, Johnson, Kutz, & Harvell, 2013; Daszak, Cunningham, & Hyatt, 2000; King, 2004).",

In Belgium, the monitoring and reporting of livestock diseases are subjected mostly on self\u2010reporting of suspected clinical cases by the farmers to the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC), with an established list of mandatory notifiable diseases for livestock and other species (aquatic, exotic) (Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain, 2019). Each suspicion is then confirmed by laboratory analysis (Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain, 2019). Thus, a rational priority setting approach is needed to assist decision\u2010makers in identifying and prioritize diseases that are more likely to (re\u2010)emerge and as such allocating the right resources tailored to a particular disease threat. One such approach used is disease prioritization, which has as main objectives: to optimize financial and human resources for the surveillance, prevention, control and eradication of infectious disease and to target surveillance for early detection of any emerging diseases (Humblet et al., 2012).",

Hence, these focused on human or zoonotic diseases and the impact they would have in certain countries. In this study, the focus is livestock epidemic diseases and the aim was to identify (re\u2010)emergence drivers' criteria and with it use expert elicitation to prioritize livestock epidemic diseases that may emerge in Belgium.",

Multicriteria decision analysis requires identifying criteria and scoring criteria according to the pathogen/disease. By weighting each criterion and calculating weighted scores from the criteria, an overall score per pathogen/disease was calculated (European Centre & for Disease Prevention & Control, 2015; Humblet et al., 2012).",

Each spreadsheet included two columns. Experts had to fill both of them. The first one corresponding to the coefficient for the choice for the criterion, and the second one for weighting they gave to the criterion (intradomain weighting). Regarding the weighting system, a Las Vegas method was applied (Gore, 1987). The number of points to be distributed was proportional to the number of criteria per category multiplied by ten. Indeed, the criterion with the most points allocated is considered the one that weighs the most in the category. If, on the other hand, all the criteria have the same weight in the category, the distribution is equitable, with 10 points for each criterion. For example, 90 points were to be distributed between the 9 criteria of the \u2018pathogen characteristics\u2019 domain. Indeed, the criterion with the most points allocated is considered the one that weighs the most in the pathogen characteristics. Such process illustrated the experts' opinion on the relative importance of criteria within one domain.",

An outbreak of diarrhoea occurred on a Belgian fattening pig farm at the end of January 2015; this was the first confirmed PED case in Belgium in decades (Theuns et al., 2015).

Low pathogenic avian influenza shows less signs and symptoms than the HPAI, and the vast majority of LPAI viruses are maintained in asymptomatic wild birds (Center for Food Security & Public Health, 2015); thus, an incursion of LPAI in an area free of the virus is more likely to happen and go undetected. Additionally, the HPAI viruses can evolve directly from low pathogenic (LPAI) virus precursors following introduction into domestic poultry (Monne et al., 2014). Hence, these characteristics of the virus give in this prioritization LPAI a higher score than HPAI, but HPAI is more likely to be detected and notified.",

These vectors are often highly abundant, across most of Africa, the Middle East, Europe and southern Asia (Carpenter, Mellor, Fall, Garros, & Venter, 2017).

In this prioritization, ASF did not obtain the highest ranking score at 16th place and placed in the group of moderate importance of the regression tree analysis. However, ASF has become more prevalent in the Caucasus regions since its spread from eastern Africa to Georgia in 2007 and the virus reached the European Union member states of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland; in 2016, Moldova; in 2017, the Czech Republic and Romania (Chenais, St\u00e5hl, Guberti, & Depner, 2018); and in 2018, the Hungary and Bulgaria. It emerged in Belgium in September of 2018 when authorities in Belgium reported that ASF had been confirmed in 2 wild boars (Linden et al., 2019). The detection of ASF in Belgium was unexpected as ASF appears to have jumped a considerable distance from previously affected countries: ~500 km from the border with the Czech Republic, 800 km from Hungary and 1,200 km from the border with Romania (Garigliany et al., 2019) and how it was introduced in the wild boar population until the writing this article is unknown (presumably related to illegal human activities) (Saegerman, 2018). The ASF score (ranked 16th place and was in group of moderate importance of the regression tree analysis) may be explained that although there was an awareness of the risk of ASF spreading to EU member states, when the questionnaire was answered by the experts (year 2016) the risk that ASF would become endemic in domestic pigs in Ukraine and Belarus was considered to be moderate and the risk to further spread into unaffected areas was also considerate moderate (European Food Safety Authority, 2014; 2014). Furthermore, the score reflected the geographical position of where ASF had been reported and it was unexpected that ASF skipped neighbouring countries and directly entered Belgium (Garigliany et al., 2019). In addition, any ranking cannot include unforeseen circumstances such as the human factors; the vigilance should be always implemented for new introduction.",

Another study, which may be used for comparison as it used MCDA approach and had swine diseases, done by Brookes, Hernandez\u2010Jover, Cowled, Holyoake, and Ward (2014), ASF ranked higher, but in this study only exotic diseases for the pig industry in Australia were ranked using criteria related to impact and the experts were pig producers, which changes the importance in the scores, giving ASF a higher ranking.",

Moreover, until recently only WNF had been reported in Europe (Sambria et al., 2013).

This is of no surprise, as economic and trade activity has priority in the age of globalization; increased movement of live animals and animal products crossing oceans and international boundaries increase the risk of spread for animal and zoonotic diseases (Domenech, Lubroth, Eddi, Martin, & Roger, 2006). On the other side of the scale, the domain defined as \u2018characteristics of farm/production system\u2019 was given the least weight, therefore with the least influence. Although this true for many diseases within the EU Member States, it is important to consider that for some other diseases in certain cases this domain could be a strong influence. One example is farms, which may have backyard pigs, with no biosecurity set in place and not always under the full control of veterinary services.
