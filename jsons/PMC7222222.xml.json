Writing at an early stage in the development of LA, Long and Siemens, two of the principal actors in the field, explained the rationale for the development of LA, arguing that research indicates that \u201cdata-driven decision-making improves organizational output and productivity\u201d, and that education is falling behind other fields in this respect.",

Important issues have been identified, the possible courses of action analyzed in depth, and recommendations are made. The designers of LA systems are tasked with providing particular functionality, and they need guidance on how to go about this in an ethically defensible way, and without alienating stakeholders. These are important matters, which have been addressed in the literature which I cite above. In this chapter, however, I am concerned less with the internal workings of the field of LA, and more with the ethical implications of the connections between LA and the wider social context in which it is situated.",

            "text": "In response to the ethical considerations which I have described above, a number of institutions have established codes of practice for LA, to make explicit what will and will not be done with student data, and the roles of those involved. Such policies include, in the UK, Jisc (2015) and The Open University (2014c); in Canada, The University of British Columbia (undated); and in Australia, Charles Stuart University (2015). These codes of practice have the great merit of making explicit the basis for LA design, and they are the results of many person-years of reflection by experts in the field. Nevertheless, contradictions can arise between ethical practices in LA and those prevailing in academic research. The Open University (OU) of the UK provides a good example, because of the exemplary clarity of its policies on research ethics and on LA. The OU FAQs on LA inform students that in order to have \u201ca complete dataset\u201d available to the University \u201c\u2026it is not possible, at present, to have your data excluded\u201d (The Open University, 2014b). At the same time, the OU\u2019s Ethics Principles for Research Involving Human Participants assert that \u201cExcept in exceptional circumstances, where the nature of the research design requires it, no research shall be conducted without the opt-in valid consent of participants.\u201d and that \u201cParticipants \u2026 have a right to withdraw their consent at any time up to a specified date\u201d (The Open University, 2014a). LA at the OU is intended to \u201cidentify interventions which aim to support students in achieving their study goals\u201d (The Open University, 2014c), an aim which has traditionally been addressed by means of academic educational research. From these documents, it inescapably appears that an OU PhD student who is researching into teaching and learning outside the OU would need to obtain ethical approval and consent from participants before gathering any data, while the student\u2019s parent organisation carries out the same research on its own students without any such constraint. All three OU documents that I have cited are dated 2014, and so this contradiction is not a case of outdated policies failing to keep track of recent developments.",

If it is unfamiliar in academia, outside areas such as management science and information systems, this may be because its objects of study have not overlapped with those of academic researchers. Once academics accept OR as \u2018research\u2019 in the full sense of the word, often working with human respondents, they may assume without further reflection that ethical codes of practice drawn from the Nuremberg Code will be applicable to it, but this has not been the case at any point in the history of OR. The lack of ethical scrutiny in OR is not simply a matter of ignorance or evasion. An athlete can keep records of their own performance, and use this data in optimising their diet and exercise regime, without the requirement for any ethical approval. Similarly, the organisation can be seen as a metaphorical (and, in many cases, legal) person that owns its own data, and has the freedom to do as it wishes with it to optimise its own performance. As Picavet comments \u201cin operational research, efficiency is not usually viewed as something which conflicts with ethics. Quite simply, it does not refer to the same category of problems.\u201d (Picavet, 2009, p. 1122). Moreover, the methods and processes which result from this research may bring significant competitive advantage to the organisation. It is therefore not surprising that opening up this research to ethical scrutiny is not only seen as unnecessary, but is also actively unwelcome, as it threatens the secrecy required to protect competitive advantage. There has been ongoing discussion of ethics within the OR community over a number of years, see, for example Le Menestrel and van Wassenhove (2009). However, where ethical codes for OR exist, they make no mention of the key dispensations of the Nuremberg Code, in particular those of informed consent and of a right to withdraw. This is the case, for example in the ethical principles of the Operational Research Society (2019).",

To illustrate the nature of these changes it is sufficient to look back at the concerns about computing in the years before the emergence of the Internet. Culman and Smith (1995) describe the furore that surrounded Lotus Marketplace. Launched in 1990, this was a CD-ROM for sale at $695 containing information about 120 million Americans, including name, address, age, gender, marital status, household income, and lifestyle and purchasing propensities. Software was included to facilitate creation of mailing lists that targeted prospective customers. 30,000 letter writers and callers contacted Lotus, complaining that the product was a violation of privacy. The CEO of Lotus concluded that the company \u201cwould be ill-served by a prolonged battle over consumer privacy\u201d, and the product was cancelled in January 1991. Despite the reticence of Lotus, that battle has since taken place, and has resulted in an unqualified victory for commercial interests over personal privacy. Today the scale of data held by Lotus Marketplace, and the threat of increased junk mail which it presented, both seem insignificant. The supermarkets where we shop (Rowley, 2007) and the websites which we visit (Evans, 2009) hold and exchange vastly more detailed data about us than Lotus could have dreamed of. The revelations of Snowdon (Greenwald, 2014) have shown that governments have secretly developed vast infrastructures to monitor and analyze the communications of individuals. Cambridge Analytica, the firm accused of harvesting millions of people\u2019s data from Facebook, \u201csaid publicly that it held up to 5000 data points on each of over 230 million American voters.\u201d (Mr. Justice Norris, 2019). While this case ended in litigation, no effective opposition has emerged to the gathering of data on a massive scale by private companies, and its use in marketing, advertising and politics. Similarly, within the field of LA the InBloom analytics initiative was closed following a public reaction to intrusive data gathering (Bulger, McCormick & Pitcan, 2017), but this has not slowed the growth of the field.",

Today, however, huge quantities of data are available, generated by clients and stakeholders\u2019 engagement with computer systems, which enable organisations to address a much wider range of OR questions, many of which are situated beyond the confines of the organisation per se. For example, retailers would in the past have conducted operations research on their organisation and communications, but would usually have relied on social scientists to analyze the social context in which they were operating. Now, however, an advertisement for analytics roles at TESCO says that successful applicants will \u201chelp the business to really understand our customers and suppliers\u201d (TESCO, 2019).

In the face of this shift in power, many social scientists appear to have accepted that a change in research practices is inevitable, with concomitant ethical implications which have yet to be spelt out. For example, the Social Science Research Council has entered into the Social Science One collaboration with Facebook. This development has been welcomed by some social scientists, for example Puschmann (2019), while the complaints of the European Advisory Committee for Science One (2019) are that \u201cFacebook has still not provided academics with anything approaching adequate data access\u201d. In contrast Leetaru (2019) argues that Social Science One will make the personal and intimate data of two billion Facebook users available for data mining by researchers, with little information available about the details of aggregation, privacy or how the results of the research might be used in intervening in society. In the context of developments such as this, it is unsurprising that LA practitioners are unwilling to commit to the constraints which would be placed on their relatively small scale studies by compliance with policies on research ethics with human participants.",

Furthermore, the contradictions identified above between ethical policies for academic research with human subjects, and ethical guidelines for the practice of LA, correspond closely to the tension between the ethical traditions of OR and academic research. I propose that the resolution of these ethical contradictions can only be achieved through an understanding of the implications of these changes for educational systems, institutions and the people who work and study in them, and then taking decisions in the light of that understanding. In the remainder of this chapter, I will consider some of the issues which will need to be addressed in order to achieve such an understanding.",

If LA is research, and is governed by the Nuremberg code, then education institutions will be required to seek consent from students and teachers for any analytical activity, in advance, and to specify the purpose of the data gathering. As we have seen above, this flies in the face of universal education practice in maintaining records of student attendance and achievement, and would rule out many of the activities of LA. It would also have significant consequences for commercial suppliers of services to education. On the other hand, if, as I have argued, LA is most usefully conceptualised as the extension of OR to the institution, then there is a prospect that the entire ethical framework for educational research could become irrelevant. There are two ways in which this may take place. Firstly, in the medium term the availability of data on the systems of institutions and their commercial partners, and the ease of access and ethical approval through LA, will inevitably be an attraction to educational researchers, and a cause for cynicism about research ethics procedures. It is hard to see how this could not undermine the authority of research ethics procedures.",

To take an example, researchers from Pearson presented a paper at the American Educational Research Association Annual Meeting (Belenky, 2018) which described a randomised control trial in different messages that were embedded in the MyLab Programming application, in order to see which would lead students to attempt and complete more problems. Five thousand students were unknowingly involved in the experiment. According to Herold (2018) \u201cthe research prompted a fierce debate over issues of ethics, privacy and consent\u201d leading to a fall in stock value. Pearson then described the experiment as a \u201crelatively minor product update\u201d (Herold, 2018) No related research has been published by Pearson, but institutions who use their products cannot know if the company is no longer carrying out such work, or if such analytics work is simply not being reported. The same is true, of course, for other companies. The question for educational institutions is whether it is ethical to make use of educational services which are not sufficiently transparent in their use of data, when doing so means that they cannot ensure that their institutional codes of practice for both research ethics and LA are being respected.",

From this perspective, it is not sufficient for LA to publish codes of practice. The ethical challenge for LA is to discuss in one framework both the codes governing research with human subjects and those governing LA, and to justify the exemptions which are granted to LA. This discussion may result in desirable changes to the governance of research with human subjects, as well as adjustments to LA. It will have to take into consideration wider changes in society regarding the use of data, and so will have social and political dimensions.

Nevertheless, while educational institutions refuse to exclude students from datasets (for example The Open University, 2014b), LA codes of practice cannot be seen only as the individual choice of an institution, but rather also as symptomatic of a society-wide coercive extraction of data from its citizens, for good or ill.

These models then become an active element in the management of the institution and of the activities of lecturers and students, and can change relationships in the institution. Brans and Gallo offer two ways of viewing the ethics of OR practice which can be applied to this situation. One perspective is that of \u201cthose whose view on ethics is mainly internal, i.e. those who focus on the relation between OR/MS professionals and clients and on the way the modelling work is carried on\u201d (Brans & Gallo, 2007), emphasising technical correctness and honesty. Within LA, such correctness would include respecting the relevant codes of practice and regulations covering the management of data. Brans and Gallo identify others for whom ethical professional behaviour \u201cmeans taking always into account the effects on society and nature of the decisions derived from their analyses and models\u201d (ibid). From this perspective a person concerned with the ethics of an LA implementation needs to look at the systemic impact of LA on the institution as a whole, and on all of the people who will be directly or indirectly affected by it. Given the complex intertwining of LA with systemic change in education, it seems incumbent to pay attention to these wider consequences of model making in LA, both positive and negative, in assessing the ethics of LA implementations.",

It is the fulfilment of Skinner\u2019s dream of a teaching machine (Skinner, 1958). To the extent that we can know and specify what is best for others to learn, and how they should learn it (and this can certainly be argued in some situations), then this approach may be justified, indeed perhaps ethically obligatory. However, the application of such an approach as a technocratic imperative, and the lack of trust which that would bring with it, would not only clash with political and ideological ideas of personal freedom, but also fly in the face of the requirements for education as they have been set out in the twenty-first century. For example, the key competences set out by the European Commission in the New Skills Agenda for Europe (Kraatz, 2017) include learning to learn, social and civic competences and a sense of initiative and entrepreneurship. It is hard to see how such reflective communication skills and intellectual autonomy can be developed if error is not allowed or, indeed, encouraged.",

With this in mind, I hope to have shown that the ethics of LA concerns not only the self-contained act of data collection, or the details of data governance, but also more complex and relative issues of who is doing what for whom, how and with what ends. This requires an engagement with pedagogy, politics and ideology which has so far been more conspicuous by its absence than its salience in the discourse around the ethics of LA.",

How did xenophobic nationalism re-emerge in democracies? How did we let the ocean become filled with plastic? Why are we unable to do anything about climate change? Why do we work more hours every year? Why were we so unprepared for the coronavirus? The answer to these questions is, I suspect, that our attention has been misdirected towards problems of marginal importance, while unnoticed processes have been radically transforming our way of life. If we want to understand the ethics of \u201chow one should live\u201d with data analytics in education, then we need to ask if our attention is well directed, or if, as I suspect, we are failing to examine links between our use of technology and wider processes that are transforming the way that students and teachers live their lives. Such a failure would risk the emergence of unintended consequences which would horrify many enthusiasts for the powerful and potentially beneficial technology of LA.\n",
