Although mixed bacterial infections can occur, the vast majority of UTIs involve a single bacterial species.1 The most common uropathogen isolated is E. coli, which accounts for approximately 50% of all isolates, followed by Staphylococcus, Proteus, Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus species. Mycoplasmas have also been isolated from dogs with UTIs, although their clinical significance can be unclear because they are usually isolated from dogs that have other disorders of the lower urinary tract, such as underlying neoplasia or cystolithiasis. Spayed females and older dogs are at increased risk for bacterial UTIs; the mean age at diagnosis is 7 to 8 years of age.1., 2. As a result of breakdown in host defense mechanisms, systemic disorders such as acute or chronic kidney disease, hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus, and systemic neoplasia also predispose dogs to UTIs (Table 89-1\n).",

The prevalence of bacterial UTI in cats with lower urinary tract signs (i.e., stranguria, hematuria, pollakiuria, or dysuria; hereafter referred to as LUTS) evaluated by referral institutions has ranged from just 1% to 3%,3., 4., 5. although the prevalence was higher (23% of cystocentesis-collected specimens) in a study from Norway.6 Most young cats with LUTS have disorders such as feline interstitial cystitis, which are not associated with bacterial infection. When UTIs do occur in young adult cats, they are generally secondary to catheterization, perineal urethrostomy, or rarely, congenital anatomical defects. In older cats, UTIs often accompany diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD). The prevalence of UTIs in cats with diabetes mellitus is 11% to 13%.7., 8. At two referral institutions, positive aerobic bacterial urine cultures were found in 17% and 22% of cats with CKD and 22% and 12% of cats with hyperthyroidism.7., 9. Other factors that may predispose cats to UTI are breed (Persians or Abyssinians), female sex, older age, and lower body weight,5., 8., 9. although some of these risk factors may also be associated with the comorbidities mentioned earlier. As in dogs, E. coli is the most common infecting species in cats. Other potential uropathogens in cats include Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Klebsiella spp., Pasteurella spp., and Enterobacter spp.1., 8., 9. Mycoplasmas are very rarely isolated from the urine of cats.9\n",

Urease production by this organism leads to precipitation of large amounts of struvite and calcium phosphate within the bladder and along the bladder and urethral mucosa, and in some cases within the ureters and renal pelvis as well.10., 11., 12. Most animals with C. urealyticum infections have severe LUTS. Emphysematous cystitis is characterized by the production of gas by bacteria within the urinary bladder wall (Figure 89-1\n). The most common cause is E. coli, but Clostridium spp. may also be involved.13., 14. Most dogs and cats that develop E. coli emphysematous cystitis have glucosuria (usually secondary to diabetes mellitus), and gas production may result from fermentation of glucose to gas products by E. coli. In the absence of glucose, proteins such as albumin may be fermented to gas. Emphysematous cystitis caused by Clostridium perfringens occurs in the absence of diabetes mellitus.13., 14.\n",

The term subclinical UTI could perhaps be applied to dogs and cats if cytologic evidence of infection (e.g., pyuria or hematuria) is present,15 but in human patients, the term subclinical bacteriuria is used even when pyuria is present.

Less commonly, hematogenous spread to the kidney occurs. A single bacterial species (most often E. coli) is isolated from the urine of approximately three quarters of dogs with pyelonephritis; two species are isolated in fewer than 10% of dogs and three species from fewer than 5% of dogs. Pyelonephritis may be acute or chronic. Strains of E. coli that cause pyelonephritis have greater ability to adhere to cells than strains that cause cystitis. Adhesins located on the tip of E. coli fimbriae (P fimbriae) adhere to glycolipid residues on tubular, collecting duct, and bladder epithelial cells. In human pyelonephritis, both P and type I fimbriae are important in colonization of the renal pelvis.21., 22. Other E. coli virulence factors associated with pyelonephritis include hemolysin, cytotoxic necrotizing factor, the iron scavenger aerobactin, and a serum protease known as Sat. Fimbriae are also important in the pathogenesis of Proteus pyelonephritis.23 The renal medulla is more sensitive to colonization than the cortex, possibly owing to impaired host defenses in a high osmolality, low pH, and low blood flow milieu. Organisms adhere to pelvic, distal, and proximal tubular epithelium and have been observed intracellularly. Considerable renal injury results from the inflammatory response to infection. Aggregation of neutrophils within capillaries and induction of vascular spasm by bacterial toxins and/or cytokines can contribute to renal ischemia.",

Guidelines for diagnosis of bacterial UTIs in dogs and cats have been published.15 Ideally, urine should be collected by cystocentesis; if this is not possible, urethral catheterization can be used. Although any pathogens isolated from specimens collected by cystocentesis are likely significant, bacterial contamination from the skin is possible; therefore, the presence of more than 103 CFU/mL of bacteria is considered clinically significant. If specimens are collected via catheterization, colony counts that exceed 104 CFU/mL for male dogs and 105 CFU/mL for female dogs are considered clinically significant.15 Free-catch (midstream voiding) specimen collection should not be used for dogs or cats because it is highly susceptible to contamination. A positive aerobic bacterial culture of a cystocentesis-collected urine specimen confirms the presence of bacterial infection in animals that have LUTS. Culture can also help to differentiate re-infection from relapse should a UTI return; if the second isolate is a different bacterial species or has a different antibiotic susceptibility pattern (also known as an antibiogram), reinfection is likely.15 Specimens for culture should be refrigerated immediately and submitted to the laboratory as soon as possible. For specimens that reach the laboratory more than 24 hours after collection, culture results should be interpreted with caution, because false-negative and false-positive test results can occur.

These paddles can be useful screening tools when client finances do not permit submission of specimens to a microbiology laboratory for culture, and they allow identification of significant bacterial growth by comparison of colony numbers to a chart provided by the manufacturer. They also reduce the effect of delays in submission of specimens to a laboratory. However, they may be inaccurate for identification of bacterial species involved, especially when mixed infections are present.28 Paddles may not yield reliable results if submitted to a laboratory for confirmation and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing.

Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid could be considered if practice/regional susceptibility trends suggest a high (>10%) prevalence of \u03b2-lactamase production by uropathogens isolated (i.e., >10% of bacteria isolated in a practice show susceptibility to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid but not amoxicillin).15 However, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid may need to be given q8h to ensure significant concentrations of clavulanic acid in the urine. Once culture and susceptibility results are available, the chosen antimicrobial drug should either be continued (if a clinical response has occurred) or switched to an alternative drug with activity against the pathogen that enters urine in high concentrations. A treatment duration of 7 days has been suggested.15 One study showed that treatment of dogs that had uncomplicated UTIs with high-dose enrofloxacin (20 mg/kg) for 3 days was not inferior to treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid for 14 days.29 Additional studies of dogs with naturally occurring UTI that evaluate short durations of treatment with other antimicrobial drugs such as amoxicillin or TMS are needed. Studies are also needed to evaluate the need for posttreatment cultures to determine whether resolution of infection has occurred.15\n",

Referral should be considered for advanced imaging and diagnostic tests to evaluate the patient for predisposing factors. The choice of antimicrobial drug should be based on culture and susceptibility test results, and preference should be given to drugs that are excreted in the urine in active form. If excreted in the urine, drugs with intermediate susceptibility could be used to treat UTIs that are resistant to other appropriate drug choices; however, a higher dose (for concentration-dependent antimicrobials) or dosing frequency (for time-dependent antimicrobials) should be considered in these circumstances. Use of nitrofurantoin could be considered for lower UTIs that are resistant to other oral antimicrobial drugs that are excreted in the urine. When mixed infections are present, ideally antimicrobial drug treatment should be directed at all organisms present. In mixed infections that involve Enterococcus spp., anecdotal evidence suggests that the Enterococcus spp. infection will resolve when the other organisms are successfully treated.15 Typically, 4 weeks of treatment is recommended for complicated UTIs, but shorter courses may be effective. Urine culture could be considered 5 to 7 days after initiating treatment to ensure the infection is not persistent and is recommended 7 days after treatment has been discontinued. If follow-up cultures are positive, further investigation to identify an underlying cause may be required. If no clinical signs are present, management should be as for subclinical bacteriuria (see later discussion).",

The use of a fluoroquinolone that is excreted in the urine in active form (i.e., not difloxacin) is recommended for gram-negative bacterial pyelonephritis, provided regional susceptibility data do not show widespread resistance to fluoroquinolones.15 The dosage used may need to be reduced if severe renal impairment is present. If combination treatment is initiated and antimicrobial susceptibility test results show susceptibility to only one drug, the other drug should be discontinued. Treatment for 4 to 6 weeks is recommended, although shorter periods of treatment may be effective and require further study. Dogs with acute pyelonephritis may need hospitalization and treatment with intravenous fluids and other medications for acute renal failure or sepsis. Urinalysis and culture should ideally be performed after 7 days of treatment and again 7 days after treatment has been discontinued, to ensure that infection has been eliminated. If the same organism is isolated again, then an additional antimicrobial drug with in vitro activity against the organism could be added. Struvite nephrolithiasis (such as \u201cstaghorn\u201d calculi) or struvite cystoliths may dissolve with antimicrobial treatment, although dietary intervention may also be needed in some cases.

Other calculi such as calcium oxalate, urate and cystine can predispose animals to recurrent bacterial infections and, if possible, should be removed.

Because trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol are more likely to be associated with adverse effects when administered for prolonged periods, a fluoroquinolone such as enrofloxacin is the drug of choice for initial treatment of gram-negative bacterial prostatitis. If the MIC of the organism is between 0.5 and 1.0 \u00b5g/mL, the highest dose of enrofloxacin is recommended (20 mg/kg q24h). Clindamycin may be a reasonable choice for dogs with gram-positive bacterial prostatitis, although this is uncommon. Treatment of dogs with chronic prostatitis should continue for at least 6 weeks. Organisms may persist within the prostate of dogs with chronic prostatitis despite appropriate antimicrobial drug treatment. Cure may not be possible without castration.",

The end result for some dogs and cats is opportunistic bacterial invasion, most often by E. coli strains that have virulence factors typical of uropathogenic isolates.35., 44. Other bacterial species that cause pyometra are similar to those that cause UTIs, with the exception that anaerobes are more often involved in pyometra, usually in mixed infections with other bacteria. CEH is not an absolute requirement for development of pyometra, and some animals with CEH never develop pyometra. Exogenous administration of estrogen (used to treat mismating) or progesterone has also been associated with pyometra.45 Rarely, pyometra occurs in conjunction with uterine neoplasia.46 Emphysematous pyometra has been reported in dogs but is uncommon.47., 48., 49.

This treatment causes lysis of the corpora lutea with expulsion of uterine contents. Medical treatment for pyometra without surgery is not recommended for dogs that are systemically unwell, and the possibility of pregnancy must first be ruled out with ultrasound. Medical treatment is less attractive for dogs with closed pyometra because (1) it risks uterine rupture; (2) it is less effective than in dogs with open pyometra; and (3) dogs are often systemically unwell. Nevertheless, it has been used with success in some dogs with closed pyometra. Medical treatment is most likely to be successful in dogs in late diestrus (>5 weeks after the end of estrus). Improvement is generally not evident for at least 48 hours, and adverse reactions to PGF2\u03b1 are common and include restlessness, hypersalivation, panting, vocalization, vomiting, diarrhea, mydriasis, fever, and rarely, signs of shock. As a result, treatment should be given in the morning on an empty stomach, hospitalization and observation are recommended for at least 4 hours after the injection (or throughout the treatment period in dogs with closed pyometra), and the dose should be carefully calculated and appropriate for the product used. Walking dogs for 20 to 40 minutes after drug administration (while adverse effects occur) may lessen the adverse effects and promotes close observation.58 The severity of signs tends to decrease with each injection administered. For dogs with closed pyometra, serial abdominal ultrasound examinations are recommended every 2 days during treatment to evaluate for evidence of peritonitis. PGF2\u03b1 can also be used to treat postpartum metritis.",

Use of estrogens to treat mismatings is not recommended.CASE EXAMPLESignalment\u201cMolly\u201d, a 6-year-old female spayed shih tzu mix from Sacramento, CAHistoryMolly was brought to the UC Davis VMTH for evaluation of recently diagnosed nephrolithiasis and hematuria. Three weeks previously, the owners had observed blood in Molly\u2019s urine. There had been no stranguria, polyuria, polydipsia, or change in the frequency of urination. They took her to their local veterinary clinic, where blood work was performed; her hematocrit was 56.5% and thrombocytopenia (86,000 platelets/\u00b5L) was present. A urine dipstick analysis revealed 2+ protein, a pH of 8, hematuria, and pyuria. Urine specific gravity was 1.014. Abdominal radiographs revealed a 3-cm opacity in the right renal pelvis that was consistent with a nephrolith (see Figure 89-2). The kidneys had a mildly irregular shape but were normal in size. Treatment with amoxicillin was initiated (23 mg/kg PO q12h for 10 days). Twelve days later, the dog was returned for dental prophylaxis. A CBC showed a hematocrit of 50% and persistent thrombocytopenia (51,000 platelets/\u00b5L). An abdominal ultrasound showed a 2.9-cm right renal pelvic nephrolith and a 7-mm left renal pelvic nephrolith. The kidneys were normal in size but had a mildly irregular shape. There was moderate thickening of the apical wall of the urinary bladder, with a small (4-mm) apical polyp. Moderate flocculent suspended debris was present within the urine and multiple sand-like calculi were present. All other organs evaluated were within normal limits. The dental procedure was canceled and Molly was referred for further evaluation.Other Medical HistoryMolly had traveled frequently to Oregon and Nevada. She was fed a stone dissolution diet (Royal Canin Urinary SO), which had been prescribed 4 years ago when crystals were seen in her urine on urinalysis, as part of a wellness examination. She was also occasionally fed dog treats. She had been vaccinated using a 3-yearly protocol for canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus, canine parvovirus, and rabies; and yearly for Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine coronavirus, leptospirosis, and Lyme disease. Her last vaccination was more than 8 months previously. She was treated with imidacloprid and ivermectin for flea and heartworm prophylaxis, respectively, each month.Physical ExaminationBody Weight10.8 kg.GeneralBright and alert, hydrated.

Both Proteus spp. were resistant to ampicillin (\u2265256 \u00b5g/mL) but susceptible to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid (4 \u00b5g/mL), cephalexin (8 \u00b5g/mL), chloramphenicol (\u226416 \u00b5g/mL), enrofloxacin (\u22641 \u00b5g/mL), tetracycline (64 \u00b5g/mL), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (\u22644 \u00b5g/mL). The E. faecalis was susceptible to ampicillin, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid (\u22642 \u00b5g/mL), chloramphenicol (\u226416 \u00b5g/mL), enrofloxacin (\u22641 \u00b5g/mL), and tetracycline (16 \u00b5g/mL).Diagnosis\nProteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis cystitis and suspected pyelonephritis with nephrolithiasis, with possible secondary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia.TreatmentMolly was treated with enrofloxacin (7 mg/kg PO q24h). The following day her platelet count increased to 31,000 platelets/\u00b5L, and by day 3 of treatment it was 64,000 platelets/\u00b5L. After 7 days of treatment, a CBC showed a neutrophil count of 5700/\u00b5L and no band neutrophils, and the platelet count was 79,000 platelets/\u00b5L. A urine culture obtained by cystocentesis at this time showed 104 CFU/mL of E. coli and E. faecalis. The E. coli was resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, enrofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but susceptible to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid (64 \u00b5g/mL). The susceptibility of the E. faecalis had not changed, with the exception that the MIC for tetracycline was 32 \u00b5g/mL. Treatment was changed to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid (23 mg/kg PO q12h). When reevaluated 3 weeks later, Molly had no clinical signs of illness. A CBC showed only mild thrombocytopenia (146,000 platelets/\u00b5L, with an MPV of 12.6 fL). However, bacteria and large numbers of white blood cells were still present in the urine sediment, the urine pH was 8.0, and E. coli with the same susceptibility pattern was again isolated from the urine. An extended panel showed susceptibility to amikacin (\u22644 \u00b5g/mL) and imipenem-cilastatin (\u22641 \u00b5g/mL), but resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefpodoxime, cephalothin, gentamicin, marbofloxacin, orbifloxacin, and ticarcillin\u2013clavulanic acid. The dosage of clavulanic amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid was increased to 23 mg/kg PO q8h. The diet was changed to a commercial urolith dissolution diet (Hill\u2019s s/d Canine Dissolution diet). After an additional month, urinalysis findings were unchanged and the same E. coli was again isolated from the urine. The platelet count was 244,000 platelets/\u00b5L and a biochemistry panel was unremarkable. Abdominal radiographs and ultrasound showed no evidence of nephrolithiasis, but multiple small, rounded mineral opacities were present in the region of the right ureter.Antimicrobial drug treatment was ultimately changed to amikacin (15 mg/kg SC q24h) 2 weeks later because an E. coli was isolated that was resistant to clavulanic acid\u2013amoxicillin. Kidney values were monitored every 2 weeks during amikacin treatment to evaluate for nephrotoxicity. The urine then became sterile, and ultrasound examination showed disappearance of all urinary calculi over a 2-month period, after which antimicrobial drug treatment was discontinued and the diet was changed to a maintenance diet. Because of the recessed vulva and the dog\u2019s excess body condition, a weight loss program was discussed with the owner. Molly was diagnosed with a subclinical Enterobacter aerogenes UTI 2 months later, which was broadly susceptible to antimicrobial drugs and treated with enrofloxacin. The platelet count was within the reference range. Further evaluation for underlying conditions predisposing to recurrent UTIs (contrast cystourethrography and cystoscopy), followed by vulvoplasty if no other abnormalities were detected, were offered to the owners but they declined further treatment and evaluation. The dog remained alive, untreated, and without clinical signs 4 years later, at which time CBC and biochemistry panel results were unremarkable but MDR E. coli was repeatedly isolated from the urine.CommentsThis is an interesting case of bacterial cystitis and pyelonephritis associated with struvite nephrolithiasis, and probable secondary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. The struvite urolithiasis was likely secondary to the P. mirabilis infection, because P. mirabilis produces urease. Months of antimicrobial treatment were necessary because of bacterial sequestration within urinary calculi. This may have explained continued isolation of bacteria from the urine in the face of antimicrobial drug treatment, although ultimately resolution of the E. coli infection quickly followed the change in antimicrobial drug choice. Meropenem would have been another appropriate choice based on the susceptibility of the organism isolated, but its use in animals is controversial because it is an important option for treatment of serious resistant bacterial infections in humans. Fortunately, dissolution of the nephroliths occurred in this case with antimicrobial and dietary therapy, and surgery to remove infected uroliths was not required. Continued UTIs were a likely sequela in this dog in the absence of successful identification and treatment of an underlying cause. Although treatment of the UTI was necessary during nephrolith dissolution, treatment of the subclinical E. aerogenes infection may not have been necessary.\n",
