Most point-of-care tests for detection of respiratory viruses have limitations in diagnostic performance and clinical usability. A novel, multianalyte point-of-care antigen detection test system (mariPOC \u00ae ; ArcDia International Oy Ltd., Turku, Finland) detects eight respiratory viruses (influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza type 1, 2, and 3 viruses) from a single nasopharyngeal swab specimen by a fully automated, random-access immunoassay method.
