This connectivity hampers efforts to eliminate infectious diseases such as malaria through reintroductions of pathogens, and thus accounting for it becomes important in designing global, continental, regional, and national strategies. Recent works have shown that census-derived migration data provides a good proxy for internal connectivity, in terms of relative strengths of movement between administrative units, across temporal scales. To support global malaria eradication strategy efforts, here we describe the construction of an open access archive of estimated internal migration flows in endemic countries built through pooling of census microdata. These connectivity datasets, described here along with the approaches and methods used to create and validate them, are available both through the WorldPop website and the WorldPop Dataverse Repository.

Additionally, in 2014 around 67 million passengers travelled on international and domestic flights every week 3 and hundreds of millions are estimated to commute daily by public transport and private vehicles 4 . Human mobility is expected to continue rising in volume and reach, producing increasing global connectivity that has a range of impacts, including rising numbers of invasive species, the spread of drug resistance, and disease pandemics. In this context, quantifying human mobility across multiple temporal and spatial scales, becomes crucial for quantifying its effects on society 5-7 , evaluating its relationship with the environment 8,9 , better understanding human-related processes such as urbanization and land use change 10-13 , and providing a strong evidence base to support both development 14-16 and public health 17-19 applications and policies.",

Evidence from the previous global malaria eradication program 37 , as well as from recent studies, control campaigns, and elimination efforts 38-41 highlight the importance of accounting for human mobility in designing elimination plans. Infected people may unknowingly transport malaria parasites (potentially including antimalarial-resistant strains 42 ) into new areas. Parasites can be imported either from other countries 43 or from other areas within the same country 44 . Thus, because of the flow of imported cases from high-to low-transmission settings, the latter will face difficulties in achieving elimination and maintaining malaria-free status if it is achieved 43 . Nevertheless, despite the importance of these dynamics being long recognized 45,46 , attempts to translate human mobility model outputs into malaria policy are still rare 47 .",

In particular, patient travel history data, containing detailed demographic information and travel motivations, are traditionally used to understand malaria parasite importation patterns 48-50 . Recently, mobile phone call detail records (CDRs) have been increasingly used for measuring short-term human movements 51,52 and thus, either alone 38, 53, 54 or in combination with travel history data 55 and malaria case data, for supporting malaria control and elimination strategic planning.",

Since the census-based migration microdata extracted from the IPUMSI database 61 represent only a sample of the total census, a logistic regression was used to model the proportion of people migrating between administrative units 65 . In particular, the logistic regression was used to model the proportion of people residing in j in the census year who were in i 'n' years prior to the census. Thus, the proportion of migrants in j in the census year that were previously residing in i was estimated using the following logistic regression function:",

Considering that 5-year was the temporal interval available for most of the countries in the IPUMSI database and the fact that it has been demonstrated that both 1-and 5-year census-based internal migration data generally align well with shorter-term population movements in terms of relative strength of connections 56,58 , the 5-year migration data were used in this study. This maximised the amount of data that could be used to fit the gravity models subsequently used for predicting internal migration flows for every malaria endemic country. Thus, for each country listed in Table 1 , harmonized, census-based 5-year internal migration data were extracted from the most recent census microdata available through the IPUMSI database 61 , downloaded locally, and eventually uploaded into a PostgreSQL database using a Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 user interface. The IPUMSI data stored in the PostgreSQL database were subsequently queried, using SQL, to quantify the number of people that migrated from each subnational administrative unit i to every other subnational administrative unit j during the 5-year timespan. These numbers were then matched to the corresponding country administrative unit spatial dataset, extracted from either the Global Administrative Areas (GADM) 75 or the Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) 76 database, in a GIS environment. This was done by manually adding a unique 'ID' to each spatial unit corresponding to the one in the PostgreSQL database (hereafter referred as 'IPUMSID'). In some cases, depending on the country, either the spatial detail of the IPUMSI migration data had to be reduced to match the lower spatial detail of the corresponding administrative unit dataset or spatially contiguous units in the administrative unit dataset had to be merged together to match the lower spatial detail of the IPUMSI migration data. In some other cases, 'IPUMSIDs' had to be edited or spatially contiguous units in the administrative unit dataset had to be merged together to match the reorganisation of the administrative units during the 5 years prior to the census. Finally, before calculating the migration flows between administrative units, another SQL query was used to classify each person in the census sample as either an internal migrant (1) or not (0). Examples of SQL queries used to perform the tasks described above are included in the WorldPop-InternalMigration-v1 code 74 ",

            "text": "There are a number of limitations, caveats, and assumptions inherent in the approach that should be considered when using the datasets outlined here. For consistency, internal migration flows were estimated using a fixed set of pull and push factors common to all countries and thus only a limited number of covariates were used to fit the gravity-type spatial interaction models and to create predictions. For this reason, as is a trade-off in the production of generalizable models, the model fit varied between countries and for some of them, such as Malawi, China, Cambodia, India, and Venezuela ( fits could be improved by considering additional, locally-specific migration drivers that could help to increase the percentage of variance explained 60, 78 . Other limitations are the fact that migration models were fitted using only a small sample (ranging between 0.07 and 10%) of the full census for each country, and that in each sample a small number of households were swapped across administrative units. Moreover, the spatial detail at which migration is captured and summarized varies by country. Because of this, for some countries, the modelled role of some of the pull and push factors, may not have been captured at the spatial level at which they influence migration as recorded in the census. It is also important to consider that the underlying migration data are based only on permanent movements captured by the census and other types of migrations, such as seasonal movements and forced displacements, may be not captured by the model [88] [89] [90] . The two main assumptions behind the approach presented here are that for each country (i) the census samples are considered to be representative at the administrative unit level at which migration was recorded and (ii) the percentage of people migrating between administrative units is considered to be constant over time. Regarding the second assumption, it is important to highlight that the use of census data from many years ago for some countries may have generated inaccurate estimates for the period considered in this study (i.e., 2005-2010), for example because of major changes in the countries' socioeconomic conditions from the time period covered by the census (e.g., the rapid economic development and urbanization that has occurred in China during the last two decades 91, 92 ) . Similarly, in some other countries, either the presence of conflicts 93 or the occurrence of natural disasters 88,89 during the specific time period covered by the census may have produced fluctuations in the number of internal migrants and consequently biased results for the period considered in this study.",
