Although RV infections cause only mild disease and are self-limiting in normal individuals, they represent a significant economic burden, particularly in loss of working hours and missed school days (Proud, 2005). Accumulating evidence also suggests that RV is an important trigger of acute exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma (Johnston et al., 1995, Seemungal et al., 2000, Seemungal et al., 2001). Experimental RV infection of asthma and COPD patients results in the development of lower respiratory disease, airflow obstruction, and systemic and airway inflammation which are greater and more prolonged than the similarly-infected control subjects (Mallia et al., 2006, Mallia et al., 2011, Message et al., 2008). The clinical outcomes of experimental RV infection correlate with viral load and inflammatory cytokines in sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage.",

            "text": "The RV life cycle offers many opportunities for intervention. The initial stage of the viral life cycle involves binding to a cell surface receptor, endocytosis, acidification of the endosome, viral uncoating, and release of viral RNA (vRNA) to the cytoplasm (Prchla et al., 1994). In the next stage, vRNA is translated as a single large polyprotein from an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) which is located in the 5\u2032 untranslated region of RV genome. The polyprotein is processed through sequential enzymatic cleavages by two virus-encoded proteinases, 2A and 3C proteinase (Foeger et al., 2003, Hellen et al., 1989). Simultaneously, transcription of viral genome that is catalyzed by virus-encoded RNA polymerase begins (Meredith et al., 1999). In the final stage of viral replication, RNA and capsid proteins are assembled into mature viral particles, which are then released by cell lysis. During the replication process, RNA viruses, including RV, modify the cellular functions to their advantage. For example, RV proteinase 2A attacks the host translational machinery in susceptible HeLa cells by cleaving eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4GI and eIF4GII, thereby shutting off cap-dependent host cell protein synthesis (Glaser and Skern, 2000, Gradi et al., 2003). Drugs which interfere with any of the above steps would be beneficial in treating RV infection.",

Non-structural proteins of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus and hepatitis virus competitively inhibit eIF2\u03b1 binding to PKR, thereby inhibiting eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Gale et al., 1997, Groskreutz et al., 2010, Li et al., 2006, Tan and Katze, 2001).

            "text": "Quercetin (3,3\u2032,4\u2032,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) is a plant flavonoid present in many plants including broccoli, apples, berries, onions, and tea. Flavonoids share a common chemical structure consisting of two phenol rings linked through three carbons. Quercetin has potent antioxidant effects, combined with free radical species to form considerably less reactive phenoxy radicals. Quercetin also has inhibitory effects on several lipid, protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases including phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3-kinase, and induces nitric oxide synthase (Agullo et al., 1997, Davies et al., 2000, Huang et al., 1999, Jiang et al., 2006, Peet and Li, 1999). Quercetin has also been shown to exert antiviral activities in vitro. Quercetin or its derivatives reduce the infectivity or replication of herpes simplex virus type 1, poliovirus type 1, parainfluenza virus type 3, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus an influenza virus in vitro (Castrillo and Carrasco, 1987, Chiang et al., 2003, Kaul et al., 1985, Kim et al., 2010b, Neznanov et al., 2008). Among the several quercetin derivates examined, 4\u2032,7-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-5,6-dimethylflavone exhibited potent antirhinoviral effects in human skin fibroblasts (De Meyer et al., 1991). However, quercetin by itself had no antirhinoviral effect in this study. Later, quercetin was shown to inhibit the SARS-CoV protease that is required for SARS virus replication (Chen et al., 2006) as well as hepatitis C viral protein translation and release of newly formed viral particles (Gonzalez et al., 2009). Quercetin supplementation was also shown to reduce susceptibility to influenza A virus infection and severity of disease following stressful exercise in mice (Davis et al., 2008) and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections in athletes (Nieman et al., 2007). This is of importance, because quercetin supplementation increases skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis modestly in untrained athletes and this is associated with improved exercise performance (Nieman et al., 2010). Since mitochondria orchestrate antiviral signaling following recognition of cytosolic viral components (Tal and Iwasaki, 2011), there may exist a relationship between quercetin-induced mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced susceptibility to influenza infection. Although, association of physical stress/fatigue with susceptibility to RV infection is not established, RV causes severe exacerbations in patients with COPD and asthma (Mallia et al., 2006, Mallia et al., 2011, Message et al., 2008). Understanding the mechanisms by which quercetin inhibits rhinovirus infectivity and replication is necessary to determine the suitability of quercetin to treat RV infections in these patients. In the present study, we examined the effects of quercetin treatment on RV endocytosis, viral genome transcription and translation, and pro-inflammatory responses in vitro. We also assessed the effect of quercetin in vivo using a novel mouse model of RV infection (Newcomb et al., 2008).",

We also showed that endocytosis of RV requires activation of PI-3-kinase. Since quercetin inhibits PI-3-kinase activity (Davies et al., 2000), we determined whether quercetin pretreatment inhibits endocytosis of RV. Quercetin pretreatment significantly decreased endocytosis of both RV1B and RV39 by BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 2\nA and B). We observed similar attenuation in the endocytosis of UV-RV. We also examined the colocalization of RV1B and EEA1, an early endosomal marker, by confocal microscopy. Cells inoculated with sham HeLa cell lysate showed diffuse signals for EEA1 in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Cells infected with RV1B showed clustering of RV particles. These cells also showed punctate staining for EEA1 as opposed to diffuse staining, an indication of recruitment of EEA1 to endosomes. Clustered RV particles frequently co-localized with endosomal EEA1, indicating endocytosis of RV in these cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, cells pretreated with quercetin and infected with RV1B showed an EEA1 distribution similar to sham-treated cells and only faint signals for RV which did not co-localize with EEA1-positive endosomes. (The faint signals for RV may represent the bound, but not endocytosed virus.) These results suggest that pretreatment with quercetin may block endocytosis of RV. Next we examined whether quercetin inhibits RV-induced phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream effector of PI-3-kinase. As observed previously, RV1B treated cells showed increased Akt phosphorylation compared to sham-infected cells (Fig. 2D). Quercetin pretreatment completely inhibited RV-induced Akt phosphorylation. These results indicate that quercetin decreases RV endocytosis and PI-3-kinase/Akt signaling, leading to a reduction in IL-8 expression.",

Although, cells pretreated with quercetin showed a slightly lower viral titer and vRNA than the vehicle-treated cells, the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 6\nA and B). Similarly, no difference in IFNs or IL-8 levels between quercetin and vehicle treated cells was observed (Fig. 6C and D). This is not surprising because quercetin or its metabolite levels in the cells peak at 5 h post treatment and it is slowly reduced with time and completely depleted by 24 h (Kim et al., 2009, Kim et al., 2010a).

Mice infected with RV1B show the presence of negative-strand viral RNA in the lungs, transmissibility of RV infection from the lung homogenates of inoculated mice to cultured HeLa cells, and the induction of a robust lung IFN response (Newcomb et al., 2008, Sajjan et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2011).

As observed above, mice infected with RV1B showed increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFN responses and this was not affected by quercetin pretreatment (Fig. 10\n). In addition, quercetin pretreated mice showed similar levels of vRNA, and viral titer to those mice treated with vehicle (Fig. 11\nA and B). Further, quercetin pretreated mice infected with RV1B also showed airways hyperresponsiveness to methacholine challenge similar to mice pretreated with vehicle (Fig. 11D). These results indicate that quercetin treatment during or after viral infection rather than pretreatment is more effective in vivo. These findings are not surprising, because half-life of quercetin ranges between 11 and 28 h (Boots et al., 2008) and therefore one would expect the plasma quercetin levels return to basal levels by 48 h.",

Quercetin inhibited replication of RV by suppressing transcription of RV genome. Further, quercetin decreased RV-induced cleavage of eIF4GI and increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. Finally, we showed that quercetin treatment of RV-infected mice decreased viral replication, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and airways hyperresponsiveness to methacholine challenge.

It inhibits several lipid, protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases by competing for the ATP binding site (reviewed in (Williams et al., 2004)). In fact, a potent inhibitor of PI-3-kinase, LY 294002 was designed based on the structure of quercetin (Vlahos et al., 1994). We and others have shown that PI-3-kinase activity is required for RV endocytosis and also for viral replication-independent IL-8 responses (Bentley et al., 2007, Lau et al., 2008, Newcomb et al., 2005). Therefore, treatment of cells with quercetin prior to or during RV infection could inhibit viral infection by abolishing RV endocytosis, an essential initial step of RV infection. Consistent with this idea, pretreatment of cells with quercetin decreased Akt phosphorylation, endocytosis of RV and attenuated the associated chemokine responses in human airway epithelial cells.",

For instance, quercetin and its derivative 3-methylquercetin were shown to inhibit synthesis of poliovirus RNA (Castrillo and Carrasco, 1987, Neznanov et al., 2008) and this was attributed to inhibition of viral RNA polymerase 3Dpol (Castrillo and Carrasco, 1987). Viral RNA polymerase 3Dpol is required for conversion of viral genome to create negative-strand RNA, which serves as a template for generating positive strand viral genome (Castrillo and Carrasco, 1987, Hung et al., 2002). Recently, polyphenols including quercetin were shown to increase zinc uptake in Caco2 cells and zinc ions have been shown to inhibit 3Dpol\nin vitro (Hung et al., 2002, Krenn et al., 2005, Sreenivasulu et al., 2010). Further, quercetin may also interfere with the processing of RV polyprotein by RV proteases that is required for activation of RNA polymerase (Hellen et al., 1989). In addition to processing viral 3Dpol, viral protease 2A also cleaves eIF4G to inhibit cap-dependent host protein synthesis and promote viral genome translation (Glaser and Skern, 2000, Gradi et al., 2003). Our results demonstrate that quercetin significantly reduced both negative and positive strand viral RNA and this was associated with reduced cleavage of eIFG4II and reduction in viral capsid protein, VP2, suggesting that quercetin may inhibit initial polypeptide processing that is required for both viral RNA polymerase processing and for cleavage of eIFG4II thereby blocking all the downstream steps in RV replication. Another possibility is that quercetin may directly inhibit viral RNA polymerase thereby blocking genome translation and synthesis of new progeny virus.",

Recently, replication of enterovirus, a member of picornaviridae family was shown to occur in specialized organelles enriched in phosphoinositide-4-phosphate (PI4P) lipids generated by PI-4-kinase III\u03b2 (Hsu et al., 2010). If RV replication requires PI4P-enriched orgenelles, it is possible that quercetin which inhibits PI-4-kinases (Prajda et al., 1995) may interfere with formation of these orgenelles thus blocking viral replication. Together, these observations suggest that quercetin may interfere with viral replication by more than one mechanism.",

Using this model system, we show for the first time that quercetin not only inhibits RV replication in vitro, but also inhibits RV replication, RV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression, and RV-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in vivo. Mice treated with quercetin showed a significantly decreased viral load, diminished levels of negative-strand RNA, and decreased replication-dependent expression of type I and type III IFNs (Wang et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2011), providing direct evidence that quercetin effectively inhibits viral replication in vivo. In addition, quercetin treatment decreased RV-induced lung inflammation, as evidenced by reduced expression of CXCL-1, CXCL-2, CCL2 and TNF-\u03b1. We have previously shown that, in addition to their role in lung inflammation, CXCR2 ligands and TNF-\u03b1 contribute to RV-induced airways hyperresponsiveness (Nagarkar et al., 2009). Neutrophils, attracted to the airways by CXCR2 ligands, induce a state of hyperresponsiveness by elaboration of TNF-\u03b1 (Nagarkar et al., 2009). Therefore, decreased airways responsiveness observed in RV-infected mice treated with quercetin may be due to decreased lung CXCL1, CXCL2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels.",

            "text": "Quercetin dihydrate is an aglycon and is passively absorbed by small intestine. Only 24% of the ingested quercetin aglycon is absorbed as oppose to 52% of naturally occurring quercetin glycosides (Hollman et al., 1995). Plasma quercetin levels are in the low nanomolar range (<100 nM) in humans consuming normal diet which is estimated to provide 5\u201340 mg/day quercetin (Boots et al., 2007, Harwood et al., 2007). Upon supplementation with 1 g of quercetin aglycone/day increases plasma levels to 1.5 \u03bcM (Boots et al., 2007, Conquer et al., 1998). Previously we have shown that treatment of mice with 0.2 mg of quercetin yield total plasma quercetin (including both quercetin and its primary conjugates) levels on the order of 150 nM (Ganesan et al., 2010, Nanua et al., 2006). This dose of quercetin was sufficient to reduce lung inflammation in a mouse model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and also an allergic mouse model of asthma (Ganesan et al., 2010, Nanua et al., 2006, Rogerio et al., 2007). Based on the present study, it appears that a nanomolar range of plasma quercetin is also sufficient to inhibit viral replication in vivo, even though a higher concentration (10 \u03bcM) of quercetin is required in vitro. Although, the precise explanation for this is unclear, it may depend on the differences in the stability and bioavailability of quercetin. One possibility is that quercetin may be absorbed better in vivo via small intestine compared to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. Another possibility is that quercetin metabolites generated in vivo may be more potent as an antiviral agent than the parent compound. Quercetin dihydrate is metabolized in different organs including small intestine and liver similar to quercetin glycosides (Harwood et al., 2007). Quercetin glycosides are in fact precursors of quercetin aglycon in vivo. Quercetin glycosides are initially hydrolyzed to form quercetin aglycon in the epithelial cells of small intestine (Murota and Terao, 2003) and the aglycon generated is metabolized by phase II enzymes present in the small intestine, liver and other organs to methylated, sulfated and glycosylated forms. One hour after intragastric administration of quercetin to rats, the majority of the absorbed quercetin was found in the form of quercetin glucuronides, sulfoglucuronides and sulfates as well as isorhamnetic conjugates (Justino et al., 2004). Quercetin glucuronide was proposed to be a more potent modulator of reactive oxygen-generating enzymes than quercetin (Terao et al., 2011). Further studies are required to assess the antiviral effects of known quercetin metabolites.",
