The solid line is based upon the presence of CF antibody at a 1: 4 dilution, or greater; of the sera positive for CF antibody, 44.8% had a titer of greater than 1: 4. The occurrence of CF antibody was less than 1% in sera collected from July to December, 1966.

The prevalence of CF antibody then declined sharply in sera collected in May and June, with a moderate increase from July to September. This increase probably does not represent a second wave, but rather the tendency of infections to cluster in families who were bled at the same time. Thereafter, the\u00b7level approached that observed during the same period in 1966. These serologic data indicate that an outbreak of infections with 229E-like virus occurred during April, 1967. In view of the usual delay in production of antibody, an increased incidence of infection probably occurred also in March, 1967. Calculation of results in terms of actual rises in antibody titer produced the dotted line shown in figure 1 ; the time indicated for each paired serum was the time of collection of the second serum in the pair. This is nearly identical with the curve of antibody prevalence because of the almost uniform absence of antibody in sera collected in 1966. The similarity also suggested that CF antibody is not of long duration, for had CF antibody persisted in those infected in the spring of 1967, it would be expected to be present in the fall.

Both isolation and serologic methods were to be employed in detecting the agents. Isolation of infectious agents was intended to demonstrate their presence in the community but because of practical limitations of the technique, was never expected to define the extent of infection. For this purpose, an extensive collection of sera on a routine basis was begun; testing of the sera would give information on the impact of a particular agent on the community and its population. This serologic approach was used to characterize the outbreak caused by a 229\u00a3-like virus, The virus was not actually isolated in Tecumseh,. since its primary isolation requires cell lines that are sensitive specifically to this virus [1, 8] . Because of the possibility that another coronavirus might have been responsible for the serologic findings in Tecumseh, it is of interest to examine the relationship of 229E to other members of this group. . Recent findings indicate that 229\u00a3 virus is. antigenically distinct from the known organ culture-grown coronaviruses (the National Institutes of Health organ culture strains and the B814 strain) [6, 7, 14] . The 229\u00a3 virus fails to react in CF and neutralization tests with immune animal sera prepared against the organ culture strains. Likewise, sera of patients from whom the organ culture strains have been isolated do not show a CF response to 229\u00a3 virus. In addition,. no cross-relationship has been found to exist between 229E and the recognized animal coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and avian infectious bronchitis virus (lBV) [6, 7, 14] . Therefore, it would appear that an antigenically similar or identical virus to coronavirus strain 229E was most likely responsible for the outbreak detected in Tecumseh in 1967. This outbreak occurred at a time when 229E was isolated in Chicago (D. Hamre, personal communication) and Washington, D.C.

The results indicated that infection with this virus was common in all age groups. Of particular interest was the fact that young children were also infected, although at a lower rate; the lower rate may mean in part that the virus was acting as a poor antigen in children. Our data confirm the findings of Bradburne et al. [10] that such infection is possible during the first 5 years of life, and suggest that this virus or group of viruses may be responsible for some of the respiratory illnesses of unknown etiology seen in this age group.

There was suggestive evidence that the older children and adults Cavallaro and M onto were responsible for the introduction of infection into the family.
