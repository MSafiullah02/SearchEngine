The hydrophobic or lipophilic molecules do not require energy for crossing the membrane. They can diffuse freely from higher to lower concentration till equilibrium is established. This process is called passive transport or diffusion. This is not true for polar or lipophobic molecules because of the nonpolar nature of membrane lipid bilayer. For polar molecules, the cell recruits mediator or transporter proteins in the membrane to facilitate their movement. If the direction of transport is from higher to lower concentration region, the transporter proteins do not use external energy and the process is called facilitated transport, because the energy needed for transport is dispensed by molecule's own concentration gradient (unequal distribution across the membrane) in the favorable direction. The free energy is minimal in unequal distribution of polar molecules. If polar molecule is transported from lower to higher concentration region, against the concentration gradient, the energy has to be provided by external source to mediator protein to make the process spontaneous in the cell, and this process is called active transport. In the cell, the energy source is mostly adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The facilitated transport unlike diffusion has shown speed and specificity, saturation kinetics, susceptibility to competitive inhibition, and susceptibility to chemical inactivation. The active transport of polar molecules against concentration gradient requires energy for transport. A large group of transporters that hydrolyze ATP to transport molecules across the membrane are known as ATPases. These carrier ATPases are classified into five subclasses according to their structure and physiological functions as P-type ATPases, V-type ATPases, F-type ATPases, ecto-type ATPases, and A-type ATPases. P-type ATPase transporters are multidomain integral membrane proteins involved in the transport of cation and lipids. Phylogenetically according to their function, these P-type ATPases are divided into five major types and various subclasses. The vacuolar ATPases are ATP-dependent oligomeric protein proton pump, which regulate acidic pH in organelle compartment like phagosome and endosome for the separation of ligand from their receptors transport proton (H + ) across the plasma membrane. The secondary transport, also known as ion-coupled transport involves the use of electrochemical potential generated by an ion transport for the co-transport of another ion against the gradient across the membrane. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, importers, and exporters, the newly identified integral proteins, comprise a large superfamily of integral membrane proteins with diverse functions. There are three major transporters which are known as flippases, floppases, and scramblases. The flippases are also known as P4-ATPases, which transport phospholipids to inner leaflet of membrane and have substrate specificity to phosphatidyl serine and phosphatidyl choline. Aquaporins (AQPs), the inte-gral proteins of membrane, are small, hydrophobic, and homotetramer proteins, which are involved in bidirectional transport. The bacteria take nutrients from their surroundings by various modes of transport but the transport of sugars and its derivatives like sugar alcohols, amino sugars, glucuronic acids, and disaccharides is transported by group translocation with histidine heat resistance protein HPr as high-energy phosphate donor protein. The transporting sugar molecule is also phosphorylated during transport, which makes sugar negatively charged. The various organisms have specialized proteins of rhodopsin family to seize light energy for various physiological functions. The rhodopsin protein part, opsin, is covalently linked to retinal chromophore, which may be in trans-or cis-configuration. The animal rhodopsin (also known as Type II) are cell G-coupled receptors, while microbial rhodopsin (Type I) may act as ion pump, ion channels, sensors, photosensory receptors and regulator for gene expression and kinases. Pore-forming toxins (PFTs), the bacterial virulence factor, single major family of proteins, are secreted by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. PFTs may be present either in cytoplasm or in the membrane. The conformational change in cytoplasmic PFTs may translocate them to membrane in need of hour. Ionophores are natural and synthetic organic molecules of diverse type, which can transport cations by forming lipid ion-soluble complex. Each ionophore possesses a unique property of changing transmembrane ion gradient and electrical potential, synthesized by bacteria, and acts as protector against competing microbes. The bacterial and eukaryotic membranes are found to have special proteins in their outer membrane for transport, which are known as porins and form channels for various small size solutes, ions, and other nutrients. The protein ion channels are passive transporters, are made up of transmembrane, are selective for their substrate ions, and have much faster rate of transport than pumps. These channel proteins do not interact with transporting ions and have two conformations, closed and open, to regulate flow of ions. The trimeric ATP-activated channels are permeable to cations like sodium, potassium, and calcium. There are seven subclasses of the group, which are involved in various physiological functions like muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release and immune responses regulation. The GABA and glycine receptors are anion channels but inhibitory in nature. GABA receptors have two subdivisions as GABA receptors family of ligand-gated channel (ionotropic) GABA A and G receptor protein family (GABA B ). The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are known as glutamate-gated cation channel for calcium permeation. The tetrameric ionotropic receptors include NMDA, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), and kainate receptor as per their synthetic ligand binding. The voltage-gated ion channels open or close in response to change in voltage and the unit of membrane potential. In excitable cells like nerve and muscle, the chemical or electrical signaling is initiated through voltage-dependent sodium or calcium influx. The K2P channels or voltage insensitive channels formerly referred to as leaky or resting channels, are ubiquitously found in all organisms. The functionally active K2P channel has two subunits, and each subunit is made up of two pore regions (P1 and P2), four transmembrane domains (M1-M4), and two characteristic extracellular helices Cap C1 and C2.

The membrane is made up of lipid bilayer to have hydrophobic interior in membrane, which is selectively permeable to small hydrophobic molecules but not to large polar ones. The passive diffusion of charged species across the membrane depends upon the concentration and also on charge of particle Z and the electrical potential difference across the membrane Dw. The diffusion of particle across the membrane is determined by Fick's law of diffusion and affected by magnitude of concentration gradient, molecular weight of solute, distance, permeability, and surface area of membrane. The diffusion coefficient of any solute molecule of Fick's law is proportionality factor, which can be defined as mass of solute diffusing through a unit area in a unit time (unit is square meter per second).

Glutamate uptake in presynaptic vesicle is found to be dependent on V-type ATPases. The V-type ATPases regulate plasma pH by exporting proton through renal intercalated cells of kidney. The mutation in V-type ATPases may cause renal tubular acidosis. The vacuolar ATPases also regulates acidic pH in osteoclasts for bone degradation, and the genetic defect in V-type ATPases may cause osteoporosis. V-type ATPases are present at the surface of neutrophil and macrophage for maintaining pH. The sperm maturation and storage also need V-type ATPases in epididymis of testis. The cancer cells are also found to manipulate V-type ATPases. The V-type ATPases are potential target for drug in various diseases. The prerenin receptors' study has indicated the role of renin/angiotensin signaling in V-type ATPases' regulation.

The catalytic domain of vacuolar ATPases contains heterohexamer of alternate A-and B-subunits with the ATP binding site at the interface of A-and B-subunits. Three subunits of A contribute majorly to three catalytic sites, and B-subunits are regulatory in functions.

During transition of E1 to E2 change in conformation (regulated step), the P-domain rearranged itself for bringing TGE loop near to phosphorylation site, which stabilizes phosphoryl group binding and ADP dissociates. The A-domain M1 and M2 segments movement closes access to cytoplasmic ion access channel (light gray).

The four monomers together form a central pore or channel for ions and gases to move but water is not allowed through this central channel. The water diffuses through individual monomers of aquaporins. The three connecting loops A, C, E are externally located, while B and D face cytosolic side. The two loops, one from each side B and E, have signature motif of aquaporin family (major intrinsic family) asparagine, proline, and alanine (NPA). There are two conserved sequences of NPA in aquaporin channel with two asparagine side chains toward pore at the end of hemipore. All transmembranes have their N-terminal and C-terminal in cytoplasm. The B-loop entering from extracellular side and E from other cytosolic side create seventh alpha-helical domain to form a part of surface for water channel. If water is moving from outside to inside, it has to interact with side chain carboxylic group of amino acid at the surface of aquaporin. The presence of arginine and aromatic amino acids at the narrowest part of the pore is the final selection for any molecule to enter.

In the pore, the electrostatic interaction of the NPA repeats and the aromatic/arginine (ar/R) constriction results in the exclusion of protons. These amino acids' segment of NPA is strong lipid anchor for changing water orientation, which is also supported by strong dipole of B and E helices to change water dipole in opposite side to previous one.

Gramicidin, isolated from Bacillus brevis, has 15 amino acids, linearly arranged in D and L alternate fashion with amino-terminal formaldehyde and carboxyl terminal ethanol amine. The hydrophobic amino acids in gramicidin support its function in channel formation. These channels have outer lining of hydrophobic amino acids to interact with lipid bilayer of membrane with hydrophilic interior for ion interaction. These channels allow very fast diffusion of ions through them in very short period unlike carrier ions.

The tetrameric ionotropic receptors include NMDA, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), and kainate receptor as per their synthetic ligand binding. These are excitatory neurotransmitters. In excitatory transmission, glutamate released from presynaptic membrane binds to NDMA or AMPA receptor of postsynaptic membrane. The NDMA receptor family have three different subunits known as Glu N1-3. The crystallographic and functional studies have revealed detail structure and mechanism of channel opening. Active NMDA receptors are tetramer with two GluN1 and two GluN2. The monomer subunit may be divided into four distinct domains as extracellular N-terminal domain, ligand binding domain, pore-forming membrane domain, and C-terminal intracellular. The extracellular N-terminal domain is linked to ligand binding domain through small linker, which is also attached to pore-forming transmembrane ( Fig. 6.51 ). The transmembrane is liked to C-terminal domain. The channel opening starts in sequential order of ligand binding ! change in conformation ! channel opening. Two separate ligands are required for NMDA receptors activation. The ligand binding domain of subunit has two subdomains S1 and S2. The S1 domain of two neighboring subunits, at their interface, creates ligand binding site and is rigid in structure but lower one S2 domain is mobile without any interaction. In typical NDMA receptor, GluN1 and GluN2 will interact with two molecules of glutamate and two molecules of glycine. The receptor with Glu N1 and Glu N3 will require only glycine for the activation. The NMDA receptors have high affinity to glutamate, high calcium (Ca 2+ ) permeability, which may be blocked by magnesium ion in voltage-dependent manner.

The other function of NMDA receptor in learning and memory can be inhibited by magnesium ion in voltage-dependent mode. In close state of receptor, the magnesium is bound to receptor in inhibition mode, which can be released only by sufficient depolarization of the membrane.
