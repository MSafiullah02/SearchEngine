Simple and rapid immunodiagnostic methods are urgently needed to identify positive cases. Here we report the development of a rapid and sensitive lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) that uses lanthanide-doped polysterene nanoparticles (LNPs) to detect anti-SARV-CoV-2 IgG in human serum. A recombinant nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was dispensed onto a nitrocellulose membrane to capture specific IgG. Mouse anti-human IgG antibody was labeled with self-assembled LNPs that served as a fluorescent reporter. A 100-\u03bcL aliquot of serum samples (1:1000 dilution) was used for this assay and the whole detection process took 10 min. The results of the validation experiment met the requirements for clinical diagnostic reagents. A value of 0.0666 was defined as the cutoff value by assaying 51 normal samples. We tested 7 samples that were positive by reversetranscription (RT-)PCR and 12 that were negative but clinically suspicious for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. One of the negative samples was determined to be SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, while the results for the other samples were consistent with those obtained by RT-PCR. Thus, this assay can achieve rapid and sensitive detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum and allow positive identification in suspicious cases; it can also be useful for monitoring the progression COVID-19 and evaluating patients' response to treatment.",

According to the COVID-19 report published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, over 70 000 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed in China. As our knowledge of the clinical features of COVID-19 and route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has grown, it has been determined that the virus has an incubation period that may be as long as 24 days, along with a high basic reproductive number (R 0 = 3.77). 3, 4 Early diagnosis and treatment are critical for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak.",

            "text": "A rapid and accurate laboratory method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is desired, 5 but the huge number of samples and complex situations in hospitals pose major challenges. 6 Establishing standards for specimen collection and nucleic acid extraction as well as the proper testing environment, and correctly interpreting test results are the major problems faced by hospital laboratories, especially those in rural areas, where resources are inadequate. Many factors could contribute to false negative results by reverse transcription (RT-)PCR, and the positive rate of the first RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was just 70%. 7 Chest computed tomography (CT) is being used as a confirmatory diagnostic method for samples with high clinical suspicion that were found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. 8 A simple and rapid immunodiagnostic method for COVID-19 would be a useful adjunct or more practical alternative to chest CT. Immunodiagnostic methods such as lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) have the advantages of being convenient and rapid. However, traditional colloidal goldbased LFIAs do not have optimal performance or quantification capability. In recent years, many fluorescence-based LFIAs have been developed for quantitative or semiquantitative detection, 9\u221212 but conventional fluorescent dyes are not the ideal reporter because they are prone to photobleaching and have poor stability or quantum yield. Lanthanide-doped polysterene nanoparticles (LNPs) can overcome these problem while maintaining the advantages of simple and rapid detection. 13, 14 COVID-19 diagnosis based on the detection of anti-SARS-CoV IgG in serum has been reported. 15, 16 Monitoring changes in serum SARS-CoV IgG concentration can also be useful for evaluating response to treatment and prognosis. 17 Highthroughput sequencing has revealed a high degree of similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the causative pathogen in the 2003 SARS outbreak. 18 Based on this finding, quantitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is entirely feasible. Given the absence of a specific medicine, convalescent serum and plasmapheresis may be used to treat COVID-19, as in the case of SARS. 19 In this study, we report the development of a LFIA that uses a recombinant nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and self-prepared LNPs to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum. . Rabbit IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Rockland Immunochemicals (Limerick, PA, USA). Mouse anti-human IgG was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). Nitrocellulose (NC) membranes, glass fiber conjugate pads, and cellulosic absorbent pads were purchased from Millipore (Hong Kong, China). Cellulosic sample pads were from Jieyi Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was obtained from Roche Diagnostics (Hong Kong, China). Other chemicals used in this study were of analytic grade and used without further treatment. Ultrapure water, obtained using a Milli-Q Advantage A10 purification system (Millipore), was used in all experiments.",

Briefly, 20 \u03bcL of EDC (1% EDC [w/v] in activating buffer) and 180 \u03bcL of sulfo-NHS (1% sulfo-NHS [w/v] in activating buffer) solutions were mixed and added to 2 mg of LNPs resuspended in 0.8 mL of activating buffer.

As shown in Figure 1 , serum samples were diluted with assay buffer (1:1000), and 100 \u03bcL of diluted sample was added to the sample well of a LFIA strip. As the liquid migrated from the sample pad toward the absorbent pad, functionalized LNPs were captured at the test and control lines. After a 10-min incubation, the strip was loaded into the portable fluorescence reader for detection of fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 and 615 nm, respectively, with the delay time set at 20 \u03bcs. Excitation of the fixed LNPs produced a bright fluorescent zone on the membrane. The results are denoted as the fluorescence peak area of the test line (At) and control line (Ac). The At/Ac ratio (R) was calculated to ",

In aqueous environments, the emission of lanthanide chelates is strongly suppressed due to energy loss through the nonradiative activation of the 5D 0 state to the O\u2212H vibration of water molecules. 22 Thus, it is preferable to encapsulate lanthanide chelates in water-dispersible spheres. The maximal fluorescence emission peak of LNPs was obtained at \u223c615 nm; the peak was narrow and symmetric (Figure 2a) . Dynamic light scattering analysis was performed for physical characterization of LNPs before and after functionalization. The change in the size and surface zeta potential of LNPs (Figures 2b and 2c) indicated that the M-HIgG and RIgG antibodies were successfully conjugated.",

Our assay can be used to monitor the progression of COVID-19, as well as responses to treatment.
