            "text": "Currently, the world has experienced various episodes of novel corona virus outbreaks. 1 As of March 1, 2020, 86,993 cases have been identified in 72 countries, and 2979 deaths have been reported from 25 countries. 2 The major outbreaks have been experienced in china, followed by South Korea, Italy, Japan, Iran and other countries including all continents except Antartica. 3 China has tried to halt the transmission of virus by quarantine of affected cities, shutdown of transport systems, and enforcing the use of face masks. 4 while other countries have focused on emergency preparedness, and strengthening surveillance systems at their ports of entry to prevent incursion of virus into their countries. [5] [6] [7] Control, containment and responding of an epidemic costs millions of dollar, 8 which is not be feasible for resource poor countries. While high income countries, and countries with efficient healthcare systems could mobilize resources and technical manpower in an efficient manner, low income countries with poor health care system and political instability may not be able to contain viral epidemic on time, 4 which could have devastating effects on public health and overall economy of the nation. The disastrous effects on public health and economy could be even more worse in the low income countries having weak capacity to effective diagnostic and treatment options, and lack of inter-sectoral collaboration leading to failure of timely containment and control of epidemics. Thus, it is imperative to resource poor countries, to rapidly detect and contain the virus at the point of entry, before the disease gets entry and establish within the country; otherwise it would be too late and humanity will suffer.",
