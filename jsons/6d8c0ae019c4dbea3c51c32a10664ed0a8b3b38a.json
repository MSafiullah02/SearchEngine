However, much evidence has now accumulated that the nucleolus is involved in many other nuclear processes. Nucleoli are of moderate protein complexity, comprising a few hundred proteins, and can be isolated for proteomic analysis. In this chapter we describe the purification and analysis of plant nucleoli by proteomic methods and summarise the current results. We also discuss more specific tagging methods that have been used to analyse individual protein complexes, as well as methods for analysing post-translational modifications of nucleolar proteins. Finally we discuss the assessment of the reliability of such proteomic data, and the presentation and curation of this type of data. 247 J. \u0160amaj and J. Thelen (eds.), Plant Proteomics",

It is where ribosomal RNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase I and where these transcripts are processed to form pre-ribosomes. Like all such nuclear substructures, the nucleolus lacks any bounding membrane, and must therefore be held together by intermolecular interactions as well as by the continuity of the rDNA within it with the rest of the nuclear DNA. It has been suggested that the biochemistry of ribosome biogenesis itself is responsible for the existence of the nucleolus as a distinct compartment (Melese and Xue 1995; Hernandez-Verdun et al. 2002) and nucleolar volume correlates with transcription levels. However rRNA transcription occurs without nucleolus formation in Archaea (Omer et al. 2000) , whereas nucleoli are formed in organisms lacking RNA polymerase I ( Conrad-Webb and Butow 1995) or multiple rRNA repeats (Matsuzaki et al. 2004) , suggesting that the formation of a nucleolus is not essential to rRNA transcription, but is an adaptation to create a compartment in which pre-ribosomes may be formed with high efficiency (Raska et al. 2006) .",

            "text": "However, much evidence now suggests that there must be more to nucleolar structure and function than making ribosomes. In the first place, nucleolar structure varies considerably between species, between cell types and between individual cells. Second, a number of unexpected, unconventional activities have been localised, at least in part, to the nucleolus (Raska et al. 2006) . In most cases these unconventional activities have been investigated in only one or two species, so that it is not yet clear whether they are general nucleolar functions or specific adaptations. For example the nucleolus has been implicated in many other aspects of RNA biology, including biogenesis of snRNAs and snoRNAs, of the signal recognition particle, of tRNAs and RNAse P, and of telomerase, as well as in mRNA surveillance. The nucleolus has also been linked to viral infections, to cell cycle regulation, to cancer and to stress responses (Hiscox 2002; Rubbi and Milner 2003; Maggi and Weber 2005; Mayer and Grummt 2005; Yuan et al. 2005) . In many cases the involvement of the nucleolus was discovered by localising factors involved in the various processes to the nucleolus. However, recent approaches using high throughput localisation studies and proteomic analysis of purified nucleoli have put these unconventional activities on a more systematic basis (Scherl et al. 2002; Andersen et al. 2005; Pendle et al. 2005) .",

This has frustrated attempts to predict nucleolar localisation in silico. Nucleolar localisation sequences (NoLS) exist in viral proteins, such as the plant umbravirus ORF3 protein (Kim et al. 2004 ) and both potato leaf-roll virus (PLRV) capsid proteins (Haupt et al. 2005) . Indeed, the nucleolar location of one PLRV capsid protein was predicted through NoLS identification (Haupt et al. 2005) , and comparison of coronavirus N-protein sequences allowed similar predictions for components of the SARS virus (Reed et al. 2006 ). However, these reflect binding to existing nucleolar proteins (nucleolin, in the latter case) and the interacting sequences are not well conserved. Similarly, a native nucleolar protein may include sequences important for localisation, as in the basic C-terminal domain of yeast Nop25 (Fujiwara et al. 2006 ) but even this is not widely conserved. Hence, nucleolar localisation remains difficult to predict.",

Direct visualisation of subcellular localisation has also been used in mice to identify nucleolar proteins amongst other nuclear proteins via an enhancer-trap system, although this study took as a starting point a broad range of predicted nuclear proteins of which only 10% were exclusively nucleolar (Sutherland et al. 2001) . In pilot screens aimed at systematically localising proteins in mammalian (Simpson et al. 2000) and plant cells (Cutler et al. 2000; Escobar et al. 2003; Tian et al. 2004; Koroleva et al. 2005 ) by systematic green fluorescent protein (GFP) open reading frame fusion expression, 2-3% of GFP fusions were highly enriched within the nucleolus. As expected, these included many RNA processing functions as well as protein kinases and phosphatases that may regulate various aspects of rRNA metabolism (Koroleva et al. 2005) . Perhaps more surprising was the finding that certain transcription factor-like proteins were preferentially located in the nucleolus, whereas related family members were found mainly in the nucleoplasm (Tian et al. 2004; Koroleva et al. 2005) .",

            "text": "The two techniques commonly used for proteomic purposes are 2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC/MS) methods. Although 2D gel approaches do have some advantages (see Chap. 2 by Hurkman and Tanaka, this volume), such as quick visualisation of the distribution of major protein groups, accessibility and relatively low basic costs, and ease of sample and data storage, they are applicable only to the major protein components of the proteome, and not suitable for proteins with extreme values of Mr (relative molecular mass) or pI (isoelectric point), hydrophobic membrane components or low-abundance proteins. More advanced uses of this methodology, such as difference in gel electrophoresis (DiGE) (Unlu et al. 1997; Lilley and Dupree 2006) significantly increase the costs -fluorescent dyes and image analysis software are expensive -but the dynamic resolution is still not very high. Furthermore, since many plant proteins are extensively modified, plant protein mixtures do not generally resolve very well on 2-DE gels. It has been estimated that single gel-based analyses allow the identification of approximately 5% of expressed cellular proteins (Heazlewood and Millar 2003) . Only an estimated 120 nucleolar proteins had been identified by such techniques prior to the use of high throughput MS methods . Therefore, there seems be more future in non-gel-based approaches for analysing the plant proteome, such as recently developed techniques like LC-MALDI MS; LC ESI MS/MS and MuDPIT (Aebersold and Mann 2003) . Nevertheless, there are several examples where a combination of 2D gel separation with subsequent identification of proteins from excised spots have allowed analysis of the plant nuclear proteome. In Arabidopsis, 500-700 spots were detected on 2D gels, and analysis using MALDI-TOF (matrix assisted laser desorption / ionisation-time of flight) MS led to the identification of 184 spots corresponding to 158 different proteins (Bae et al. 2003) . In rice nuclei isolated from suspension culture cells, from a total of 549 proteins resolved on 2-DE, 190 proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF MS from 257 major protein spots (Khan and Komatsu 2004) .",

This method simply measures the mass of each ionised peptide, providing a \"fingerprint\" of protein composition, with protein identification based on matches between measured masses of peptides and predicted masses of proteolytic cleavage products of the proteins present in databases. The caveat is that with the increasing length of the peptide chain, many peptide fragments with different sequences will have very similar masses. The same problem sometimes results from protein modifications. Besides MALDI, another common ionisation method is electro-spray ionisation (ESI). The multiply charged ions generated by ESI often produce MS/MS spectra that are cleaner and potentially easier to interpret (Bodnar et al. 2003) . In general, thorough protein separation/purification is required for ESI, since this technique is very intolerant of any contaminants.",

MALDI tandem mass spectrometers allow a preliminary LC separation \"off-line\", in which the eluted fractions are spotted onto a MALDI sample plate for later MS analysis. Therefore, LC-MALDI techniques do not suffer from the time constraints imposed by the transient presence of peptides eluting from a column; if necessary, each sample can be analysed more than once. On the other hand, with LC-ESI techniques the sample eluted from the LC is sprayed directly into the ESI source and data is acquired immediately. Because in LC-MALDI the LC is decoupled from the MS analysis, the data is not available immediately, as it is with ESI analyses, and chromatography problems can be present but undetected until too late. MuDPIT (multi-dimensional protein identification technology) is a development of an online LC approach, in which two sequential microcapillary columns (an ion exchange column followed by a reverse phase column) are used to separate very complex mixtures of peptides for MS/MS analysis. This type of analysis allows the identification of very large numbers of proteins/peptides from complex mixtures with the minimum of pre-treatment.",

For these reasons, all methods for preparing nucleoli have relied on mechanical fragmentation procedures. In the case of plant cells, the cell wall must be digested by degrading enzymes, such as cellulases and pectinases, to produce protoplasts. This is necessary to avoid the nuclei and nucleoli being trapped inside the cell wall residues after cellular fragmentation. Pendle et al (2005) used Arabidopsis suspension cultures as a convenient, reproducible and abundant source of cells. The cells were protoplasted, and then the protoplasts were carefully disrupted by a small number of strokes of a stainless steel homogeniser, with a clearance between the piston and chamber of 25 \u00b5m, observing the state of the preparation after every few strokes. In general the first few strokes released mostly intact nuclei, while further homogenisation then disrupted the nuclei to release nucleoli.",

One of the most critical factors is the Mg 2+ concentration. Magnesium ions causes chromatin to cross-link into an unworkable network, and centrifugation steps then bring down the chromatin with the nucleoli enmeshed in it. To solve this problem, Pendle et al (2005) simply left Mg 2+ out of the homogenisation buffer. The nucleoli could then be separated from the chromatin. However, a small concentration of Mg 2+ was added immediately after centrifugation, since lack of Mg 2+ caused a gradual disintegration of the nucleoli.",

            "text": "Studies during the past few years using live cell imaging of fluorescently tagged proteins have caused a reappraisal of the dynamic nature of the nucleolus, and indeed all other nuclear compartments. It has become clear that virtually all nuclear and nucleolar proteins are rapidly exchanged with the nucleoplasm, and that what distinguishes 'nucleolar' components is a mean nucleolar residence time of the order of seconds rather than of fractions of a second (Phair and Misteli 2000; Raska et al. 2006 ). This raises the interesting questions of how nucleoli can be isolated as distinct structures over the timescale of minutes or hours necessary for the purification, and how the structures isolated relate to nucleoli seen in living cells. It would be expected that most of the associated protein and other mobile factors would be lost to the medium during extraction and purification, leaving only the most strongly attached factors. The fact that most of the expected proteins are present in purified nucleolar fractions suggests that the situation is more complicated. One possibility is that, along with the rapidly exchanging population of proteins, there is a more stable population. Another possibility is that the changes in medium, ionic strength, metabolite concentrations, etc., that occur during nuclear fragmentation and nucleolar purification cause the dynamic exchange of many of the proteins to stop, either because active processes necessary are halted or because changes in the medium cause an effective precipitation of nucleolar contents into a less soluble state. It is important to bear in mind that these processes may affect different nucleolar constituents to different extents, and that 'purified' nucleoli are unlikely to have exactly the same composition as their in vivo counterparts. However, extracted Arabidopsis nucleoli remain transcriptionally competent (P. McKeown and P. Shaw, unpublished data), which gives some confidence in the validity of the purified fractions.",

Many of the unexpected human proteins have also subsequently been confirmed as being in the nucleolus by structural methods such as GFP tagging and immunofluorescence . It is also notable that a large proportion of the nucleolar proteins identified in these proteomic analyses are currently completely uncharacterised, further supporting the view that we have as yet a very incomplete picture of the biochemistry that is taking place in the nucleolus.

It is also likely that PTMs of other non-histone proteins have been underestimated, and will be revealed by detailed MS analyses. The use of tandem MS/MS processing to sequence covalently modified peptides was first reported by Olsen and Mann (2004) , and the method is amenable to highthroughput techniques by using a quadrupole as the first MS stage. As with identification of unmodified peptides, it is possible to study either a pre-selected group of proteins of interest, or to sample the entire proteome. More focussed approaches have been used in several organisms for different modifications, and may allow a greater level of detail. Nevertheless, full determination of all modification sites is still technically difficult. For example, analysis of phosphorylation sites of the nucleolar RENT complex in yeast failed to detect all known sites, even when several different techniques were focussed on just these proteins (Chen et al. 2002) .",

McKeown and P. Shaw, unpublished work). In the same study, eEF1a (1g07930) was found acetylated at two sites, and the mammalian equivalent has also been detected in an acetylated form (Kim et al. 2006 ). The total number of acetylations found was fewer than in mouse, partly because the majority of acetylated proteins in mouse are mitochondrial or cytoplasmic, and many acetylated nuclear proteins are probably not enriched in the nucleolus (Kim et al. 2006 ). Kim et al. made use of affinity purification with an anti-acetyl lysine antibody, but were still unable to detect many known acetylations, especially those associated with rare transcription factors. Combining fractionation with affinity tagging may increase the number of nucleolar covalent modifications detected, but restricts the number of modifications that can be searched. For example, our survey detected seven sites of methionine acetylation that would not have been detected had an acetyl lysine-specific antibody been used.",

Dimethylation and citrullination are isobaric and hence cannot be distinguished by this method. Additionally, it may not be possible to distinguish between the modifications of different residues within peptides, a particular problem with highly modified proteins such as histones.

Finally, it will also depend on a presence of the peptide sequence in the database or databases to be searched subsequently.

Although significant progress has been achieved recently with the development of fluorescent stains and the DiGE technique (Unlu et al. 1997; Lilley and Dupree 2006) , 2-DE still allows only a subset of the proteome to be analysed, as certain groups of proteins, such as membrane proteins, co-migrating, low abundance proteins and those with extreme values of molecular mass and pI, cannot be clearly separated and/or visualised. In our experience this means that the majority of plant nuclear and nucleolar proteins either do not run cleanly in 2D gels or do not enter the gel at all. The low dynamic range of DiGE is also a major limitation of this technique. Protein identification from excised gel spots also has limitations because the spots are often contaminated with other proteins. Alternative approaches, non-gel-based quantitative proteomic methods, are based on comparison of peptide abundance, determining the isotopic composition of one or more elements in a compound after stable isotope labelling of a sample, either in vivo or in vitro. We will describe here a selection of isotopic labelling techniques that have been used on plant material. The labels can either be incorporated in vivo as substituted metabolites such as amino acids, or after purification and digestion by reaction with the resulting peptides.",

Two or more cell cultures are grown in parallel using different substituted amino acid mixtures, and then the cultures are subjected to different conditions or treatments, such as drug treatments or stress. After treatment, the cultures are pooled and used for biochemical purification. At the MS stage the relative amounts of each peptide can be quantified, since the origin of the peptide can be determined by its isotopic composition. In general, isotopically substituted lysine and arginine are used together, since all tryptic peptides should then be labelled. It is usually necessary to grow the cell culture in the substituted amino acids for a few days to get a good level of incorporation. This approach was used by Andersen et al (2005) to determine the effects of different drug treatments on human nucleoli. Other typical applications are analysing dynamics events by adding isotopically substituted amino acids to a cell culture at a given time, and analysing samples during a time course (Ong et al. 2002; Blagoev et al. 2004) . A large scale proteomic study tested the feasibility and technical challenges associated with SILAC to uncover quantitative changes during apoptosis in the nuclear proteome, resulting in the identification and quantification of 1,174 putative nuclear proteins (Hwang et al. 2006) . Another recent example of the application of this technique is selective isotope labelling of proteins from Arabidopsis cell cultures by growing cells in the presence of a single stable isotopically labelled amino acid (Gruhler et al. 2005) . A potential problem in applying this method to plants is that plant cells are better at inter-converting amino acids than animal cells, and so there is a risk that other amino acids may eventually be labelled.",

Disadvantages of iTRAQ include the increased MS time required because of the increased number of peptides, and the fact that samples must be prepared according to strict guidelines.",

All three approaches yielded quantitative results with reasonable accuracy when the same protein mixture was used. In DiGE, accurate quantification was sometimes compromised due to the full or partial co-migration of proteins. The iTRAQ method was more susceptible to errors in precursor ion isolation, especially with increasing sample complexity. The global-tagging iTRAQ technique was more sensitive than the cysteine-specific ICAT method, which in turn was as sensitive as, if not more sensitive than, the DiGE technique.",

The most common previous purification methods for protein complexes used antibody pull-down, and this caused a high background of peptides arising from the antibodies used. The original TAP tag consists of tandem protein A domains, linked via a tobacco etch-virus (TEV) protease site to a calmodulinbinding protein (CBP) domain. In practice, the protein of interest is expressed as a TAP-tagged fusion protein, and a cell extract is made after expression of the fusion. The tagged protein, along with complexed proteins, is absorbed on to IgG beads via the protein A domains, washed, and then released by TEV protease treatment. A second round of purification involves binding to calmodulin beads in the presence of Ca 2+ , followed by washing and release by a buffer containing EGTA to remove the Ca 2+ , and dissociate the calmodulin complex.",

            "text": "However, the NTAPi and CTAPi tags also have some disadvantages. First, many plant proteins have CBDs and therefore will be co-purified with the tagged protein (Reddy et al. 2002) . We regularly observe co-purification of elongation factor (EF) 1-alpha proteins, from a small EF-Tu/EF-1A subfamily of identical genes At1g07920, At1g07930, At1g07940, At5g60390 (an example present in Table 16 .1), which have a CBD, in protein mixtures pulled down by a number of different NTAPi-and CTAPi-tagged proteins. Two rice EF-homologous proteins were reported to be among the recurring cellular proteins in the TAP procedure by Rohila et al. (2006) . Second, the proteolytic treatment by TEV protease involves incubation at 16\u00b0C, which may lead to proteolysis by endogenous proteases, because at this stage general protease inhibitors cannot be added to the reaction buffer because they would inhibit the TEV protease. The exception is E-64, but this inhibits only cysteine proteases. These problems have been addressed recently by development of an alternative tandem affinity purification tag for the isolation of plant protein complexes, called pC-TAPa (Rubio et al. 2005 ). This construct is also a Gateway-compatible vector, allowing convenient recombination of ORFs from pre-existing Gateway entry clones. The pC-TAPa tag consists of two protein A binding domains, a 3C HRV protease site, six histidine repeats (6-His) and nine myc epitope repeats (myc tag). An advantage of 3C HRV protease is that this enzyme is active at a wide range of temperatures from as low as 4\u00b0C (although this requires an increase of either the amount of the enzyme in the reaction mixture, or in incubation time, compared to the relatively fast cleavage at 16\u00b0C). The second purification step can use either the 6-His tag or the myc tag, but 6-His tag Ni affinity chromatography has been reported to be more efficient than myc-tag epitope immunoprecipitation (Rubio et al. 2005) .",

This produced relatively high levels of expression of this particular protein. Another significant change made to the original protocol was using TCA protein precipitation and tryptic digestion of the pellet, instead of separating proteins on a gel and cutting out bands with subsequent digestion. This modification of the procedure avoided losses of yield at the stage of gel separation and extraction of peptides from the gel, which can be 50% or more. It also minimised the time required for MS analysis, as 39 proteins (Table 16 .1) were identified simultaneously during a single 1 h LC run followed by nano ESI Q-TOF analysis. Several fractions were set aside from the affinity purification steps for subsequent Western blot analysis, which showed the molecular mass for the fusion protein band to be much higher than expected for this small 14 kDa protein (Fig 16.2 ). This suggested that the protein was isolated in its homo-or hetero-dimeric form. Another nuclear transport factor, p15h3 (At1g27310), was present among the copurified proteins (Table 16 .1), and so it is likely that these proteins form a stable hetero-dimer or higher order complex. Half of the identified proteins (Table 16 .1) were components of the large and small subunits of the ribosome, which would be expected for a nuclear transport factor. We expressed a GFP fusion of p15h2 ORF in Arabidopsis suspension culture and observed a striking pattern of localisation on the surface of nuclear envelope, which probably corresponds to nuclear pores with which p15h2 is associated (Fig 16.3) . From our experience with several other TAP-tagged proteins, the most essential factors for the successful isolation of protein complexes are the abundance and stability of the complex, a conclusion also drawn by Rohila et al (2006) .

However, when data from different large-scale projects are compared, certain groups of proteins appear to be ubiquitous despite pre-proteomic sample fractionation techniques. So an important challenge is how to set up criteria to distinguish between true positive identifications and false positives. A consortium has been established to develop general criteria for the publication and exchange of MS data and database search results (Kaiser 2002) , and guidelines have been developed to assist researchers in the publication of protein identification from MS data (Carr et al. 2004) . A method to estimate the rate of false positive identifications using a reverse database (Peng et al. 2003) has provided a technique for reporting the stringency of the search parameters (Cargile et al. 2004 ). This approach was applied to the analysis of nucleolar proteins in the most recent publication of the nucleolar proteome . The criterion used in this study was set up as at least two matching peptides per protein, a mass accuracy within 3 ppm, a MASCOT score for individual peptides of more than 20, and a delta score of more than 5. The threshold of statistical significance in MASCOT searches is a generally accepted criterion for protein identifications. However, researchers working with unsequenced or incompletely sequenced genomes have to perform searches against expressed sequence tag (EST) databases and sometimes have to consider single peptide matches.",

(2006) note, the data on the basis of which such identifications were made may need to be provided to ensure valid comparisons between different experiments or systems (such as the full list of peptides made available following recent analysis of the human acetylproteome; Kim et al. 2006 ) in a manner analogous to the 'MIAME' standards (http://www.mged. org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame_1.1.html), which allow direct comparisons between microarray data.",

Neither can it determine the distribution of that protein within the organelle. All of this information provides important guides to function. For these reasons, and also to assess the rate of false positives, about half of the proteins identified in our original Arabidopsis nucleolar proteome (those for which we could obtain ORFs at the time) were transiently expressed as GFP-fusions (Pendle et al. 2005) . These data are also provided in the Atnopdb database, including specificity for subnucleolar compartments and presence in other parts of the nucleus and cytoplasm. Attempts to understand the complexities of protein localisation could be aided by the use of databases that compile and compare localisation data from different sources. Unfortunately, neither the cross-species Organelle DB (http://organelledb. lsi.umich.edu; Wiwatwattana and Kumar 2005) nor the Arabidopsis-specific GFP/ MS-based \"sub-cellular location database for Arabidopsis proteins (SUBA)\" at www.suba.bcs.uwa.edu.au (Heazlewood and Millar 2003) or GFP-based database at http://aztec.standford.edu/gfp/ ) specify sub-nuclear regions.",

The presence of protein domains of known function within such proteins can help both in suggesting potential functions and in the broader study of the nucleolus in evolution. For example, an analysis of protein domains of the human nucleolar proteome concluded that the core functions of the nucleolus (i.e. those connected to ribosome biosynthesis) were of archaeal origin, but that the many eukaryote-specific domains suggested that the nucleolus had undergone a massive subsequent enlargement, driving the evolution of, for example, RNA helicases (Staub et al. 2004 ). Accordingly, the human proteome database is searchable by protein domain, as well as by gene ontology.",

Full use will have to be made of EST databases, and it will be necessary to ensure that such libraries are as amenable to automated searching by MASCOT or related software as are genome databases. BLAST search against the genomes of sequenced relatives such as rice will also be important. Although considered the 'model grass', rice is only distantly related to wheat (diverging 130-240 million years ago; Crane et al. 1995) , and the proposed sequencing of the Brachypodium genome may be important for searching for homologues of wheat proteins within a more closely related species.",

Cell biologists would add to this the determination of the sub-cellular and sub-organellar location and the dynamics of all the cell's proteins. We are a long way from achieving these ambitious goals, if indeed they are achievable or if they are still considered worth achieving when they become technically possible. One major problem is the sheer number of possibilities; most mammalian genes are subject to alternative splicing, and alternative splicing is likely to be much more widespread in plants than currently expected. Each resulting polypeptide is then potentially subject to hundreds of PTMs. In addition to the enormous number of possible molecular species arising from each gene, the dynamic range in concentrations of proteins is also enormous, ranging from as low as one or two molecules to many billions per cell. This is currently one of the most significant limitations in proteomics technology; low abundance species are simply swamped by the overpowering concentrations of common proteins.",

Each new generation of MS machines has greater sensitivity, speed and throughput. The result is that current technologies are proving highly productive for samples of medium complexity, such as nucleoli, which contain a few hundred different proteins. In many cases, these 'partial proteomes' seem more accessible than total cellular proteomes and, at least in the short term, the information that this type of analysis can provide seems more useful. Many practical problems of displaying, interpreting and curating the information remain, as well as issues of reproducibility and control of artefacts, but these technical problems are likely to be alleviated as the technology matures. As with other types of large-scale bioinformatics data, accessibility and interoperability of different types of data is still a problem. In our experience, the power of proteomics analysis has to be seen in the context of the complementary cell biology techniques for localisation of the proteins identified. Proteomics will clearly be most powerful when closely integrated with other techniques in multi-disciplinary approaches to biology.",
