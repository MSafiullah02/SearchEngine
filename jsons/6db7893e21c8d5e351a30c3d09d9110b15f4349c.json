Later definitions emphasize the hazards that characterize disasters, meaning that a disaster is viewed as an extreme event that arises when a hazard agent intersects with a social system (Burton, Kates and White, 1978) . In this approach, environmental hazard cycles and agents are the focus (Quarantelli, 2005: 347; Perry, 2007) . This approach is close to the traditional geographers' view, which also defines disaster as \"the interface between an extreme physical event and a vulnerable human 3 population\" (Susman, Okeefe and Wisner, 1983: 264) . While more recent definitions in the hazard approach retain the hazard origins of disasters, they have begun to examine them in social terms, particularly with regard to vulnerability and resilience (Alexander, 1993; Mileti, 1999; Cutter, 2005; Perry, 2007) .",

It focuses on vulnerability as socially constructed and the idea of social change, all to the near exclusion of physical agents (Kreps, 1998; Stallings, 1998; Quarantelli, 2005; Perry, 2007) . Therefore, this approach departs from the two discussed so far. In his definition of disasters Quarantelli (2000: 682) includes a variety of features. Disasters: (1) are sudden-onset events, (2) seriously disrupt the routines of collective units, (3) cause the adoption of unplanned courses of action to adjust to the disruption, (4) have unexpected life histories designated in social space and time, and (5) pose a danger to valued social objects. The entire concept is social: vulnerability is socially constructed by relationships in the social system and disasters are based on the notion of social change (Rosenthal, 1998: 226; Perry, 2007 ).",

If, as a result of the hazardous materials spill, a neighborhood must be evacuated and a local stream is contaminated, these are also cascading events. Taken together, the effect of cascading events can be crippling to a community (May, 2007) . Indeed, the T\u014dhoku earthquake of 11 March 2011 is considered an outstanding example of a cascading disaster. It affected three prefectures in northeast Honshu, the main island of Japan. Although only about 100 people died as a direct result of the earthquake, about 18,000 were killed by the ensuing tsunami. The most enduring consequence of this event may be the radioactive contamination resulting from the damage the tsunami inflicted on the Fukushima Dai'ichi nuclear reactors which, in the short term, forced the evacuation of 200,000 people from the surrounding area (Pescarolli and Alexander, 2015) . Further effects of these events included damage to the global supply chain, severe environmental damage and a worldwide impact on attitudes and policies about nuclear energy.",

(2018) develop a network model with complex connections between the different nodes, yet they also propose an input-output model for analyzing each node in the network in isolation from the others. Indeed, network effects may inflict damage in a variety of areas in complex and non-linear ways. However, when planning a particular operating system or a strategy to cope with emergency or crisis situations, these effects can be considered inputs. Hence, each node or event in the chain may be analyzed in isolation from others. I will argue that in this kind of crisis situation, as in any isolated disaster, there are cascading effects but these occur at the social level and involve the development of a panic or the mobilization of efforts to deal with the crisis.",

While purely spontaneous collective action is rare, there are mechanisms that fit this characterization quite well. One such mechanism is the \"bandwagon\" effect, also termed the \"domino\" or \"snowball\" effect, where individuals' decisions about whether or not to participate in a collective action are influenced by the number of people currently involved 9 in those efforts. Assuming that individuals recognize the need to protest or exert effort to achieve a collective goal, it follows that a larger number of participants reduces the costs of action and increases the chances of success (Granovetter, 1978; Schelling, 1978; Karklins and Petersen, 1993) . Opponents of the collective goals, such as the government in the case of mass protest, who observe a large-scale movement are less likely to take violent measures to counteract the movement but, rather, will tend to be sensitive to public demands. Similarly, when many people join the efforts to increase the readiness for a disaster, the costs that each one has to pay decline as the collective efforts increase. Thus, players join collective efforts when the number of participants reaches a certain subjective threshold, meaning that the probability of non-participants joining the collective effort is proportional to the number of participants. This creates a cumulative effect that may lead to mass mobilization.",

Indeed, the literature on the bandwagon effect focuses on explaining its basic rationale (Schelling, 1960; Taylor, 1987; Karklins and Petersen, 1993; Colomer, 1995) or its disadvantages and limitations (Granovetter, 1978; Kuran, 1995) .

Hinz et al (2011) argue that seeding strategies have strong influences on the success of viral marketing campaigns, showing that seeding to wellconnected individuals is the most successful approach because these attractive seeding points are more likely to participate in viral marketing campaigns. On the contrary, Watts and Dodds (2007) show that under most conditions that they consider, large cascades of influence are driven not by \"influentials\" -a minority of individuals who influence an exceptional number of their peers -but by a critical mass of easily influenced individuals. In the current paper, I argue that a critical mass of participants is necessary for successful collective action while entrepreneurs, or activists, may also have important roles in such dynamics.",

These may be human agents, social structures or forces of nature. Furthermore, the model takes into account that while some people withdraw from collective action, others may join in. This complex modeling approach makes it possible to identify the conditions for specific types of the bandwagon effect. In keeping with the approach, a mathematical model for calculating the time that elapses until the dynamic reaches equilibrium is proposed. Since these conditions are only implicitly linked with individual preferences and beliefs, the model suggests that a given bandwagon effect can be explained and planned without knowing the exact preferences of the players. In other words, by aggregating individual beliefs and actions we are able to analyze the outcome of a certain bandwagon effect depending on a few structural variables rather than measuring 11 individual beliefs and preferences in a given society. Furthermore, the continuous time model makes it possible to determine how long it takes the dynamic to converge to equilibrium.",

The rate of new participants joining the collective activity is influenced by the preferences of passive citizens, and is also strongly affected by the mobilization efforts of activists. It should also be noted that the participation rate increases as the number of citizens increases, because the participation rate is expected to rise as the number of potential participants increases. Similarly, the participation rate is expected to increase as the number of those who already participate increases. In other words, based on the bandwagon mechanism, it is assumed that people who do not participate will do so when the number of participants reaches a certain subjective threshold.

All that has to be known is the size of the population, the number of participants at the starting point, and the approximate ratio between the resources invested by those who try to mobilize collective action and those who are in a position (or have the motivation) to counteract it. The estimation process involves varying interpretations, but it is easier than the precise identification of individual preferences and beliefs in society at large. Furthermore, the theoretical framework allows us to draw several testable conclusions. Second, the time it takes for the movement to reach its equilibrium size approximately depends on all of the parameters in the system, including the size of the entire population and the initial starting points. Thus, although a very small group of activists can successfully initiate a mass movement, it may take much more time to reach its maximal size compared to the initiation of a collective action by a large group of activists. Third, the model shows that the ratio between the initial number of potential protesters and the leaving and joining rate determines whether the movement will decline from the very beginning or will grow to a certain maximal level and then decline to zero. Finally, we should emphasize that real-world applications of this theoretical framework do not require empirical measurement of individual preferences and beliefs. Therefore, such applications may improve 13 our understanding of the shared mental models guiding individual behavior discussed by Denzau and North (1994) .",

According to this approach, when people watch other people participating in an action, they do not necessarily update their cost-benefit calculations or learn about the identity of others. Rather, given that they know other people's beliefs, they use the actions of these people to learn about the state of the world, that is, a whole set of parameters external to the players themselves. This approach is a general conceptual framework for analyzing information processing in any dynamic of collective action and hence cascading events. It can accurately, yet simply, describe complex mechanisms of information processing. At the same time, it is general enough to rationalize individual behavior in a wide variety of collective action dynamics. A good example are the processes of learning and information updating during the recent Covid-19 pandemic.",

This reasoning is also the basis of Aumann's (1976) seminal paper concerning the inability of rational players to \"agree to disagree\" about the probability of a given event. The intuition for this is that, if a player knows that his/her opponent's beliefs are different from his/her own, he/she should revise these beliefs to take the opponent's information into account. Based on this conceptual example, a variety of applications to economic theory have been proposed (Kreps, 1977; Tirole, 1982; Rubinstein, 1989; Hart and Tauman, 1996) . This approach has been also used to explain dynamic information aggregation. Rob (1991), Caplin and Leahy (1993; Chamley and Gale (1994) show how information externalities might cause agents to delay action inefficiently, because there is an incentive to wait for others to take costly action. Caplin and Leahy (1998) suggest a search theoretic model with information spillovers showing that the delay until the first player acts is suboptimally long due to information externalities. They provide examples in which social optimality demands immediate action, but the market produces an arbitrarily long delay.",

Players who decide whether to join a collective action face a complex decision that includes several variables. They do not simply count the number of participants but, rather, try to identify the \"state of the world\" in which they act. This state is composed of various structural parameters, external to the group, such as the natural and environmental conditions, government attitudes, the conflicts and coalitions in the political system, the international conditions, the socio-political situation, economic conditions, and other parameters that may be relevant to specific groups. Each player forms subjective beliefs concerning the state of the world that must exist before he/she decides to take action. These beliefs implicitly express the individuals' cost-benefit calculations as well as their attitudes toward risk. In comparison, in the threshold models the costs and benefits attached to collective action constantly change according to the observed number of participants. For example, consider two states of the world -State 1 and State 2 -that are identical in all aspects except one-the attitudes of the government towards collective action, or towards the Covid-19 pandemic. State 1 represents a situation in which the government is flexible about collective action, or the pandemic, while in State 2 the government is determined to suppress mass collective action, or the pandemic. In such a case, a player who has all the information about the state of the world except the attitudes of the government cannot distinguish between State 1 and State 2. The less information a player has about his/her situation, the less he/she can distinguish between states of the world.",

The basis for acquiring information is the prior beliefs of members in society about the type of information that each one has. In strong social networks, which typically characterize small communities that also face significant risks, members of society may know the identity, beliefs and type of information held by other people in society but they may be ignorant of certain structural conditions or the attitudes of the regime. This theoretical game approach includes a few basic components. The conceptual term 'The state of the world' gives a detailed specification of the physical universe, past, present and future. It specifies the players' preferences, mutual beliefs, subjective knowledge, strategies, and actions, as well as the rules of game and structural conditions. When a player cannot accurately observe all of the components that comprise a specific state of the world, he/she cannot distinguish between several states of the world with respect to a certain component. The player's knowledge is formally described by a collection of mutually disjointed and exhaustive classes of states of the world. If two states of the world are in the same cell, the player who observes reality can tell which cell reflects this reality, but cannot distinguish the states that are in the same cell. Note also that the fewer the states of the world in each cell, the greater the player's information about reality.",

But, in terms of game theory, such information may be considered \"cheap talk,\" which is costless pre-play communication that does not bind the players to the statements they make. Thus, its reliability is questionable. Therefore, people tend to rely on other people's actions, rather than on talk, as an indication of these people's preferences and beliefs.

The probability that joining the effort will prove effective increases as more people join in; hence 20 the bandwagon rationale.

Yet, this is only one case. By changing the partitions and/or the decision rules or increasing the possible states of the world, we can have similar phenomena but with different timings. This possibility underscores the role of leaders or the media in providing some basic information, which leads players to learn about the state of the world in which they operate. According to this argument, social leaders and the media do not convince people that they are in a bad situation nor do they always inform players 21 about the preferences or expected actions of others. Rather, they make certain facts common knowledge, thus leading people to update beliefs by their own observations. We should emphasize that the mechanism discussed so far does not explain changes in preferences. We assume that people's preferences are already shaped, meaning that they are willing to participate in collective efforts if they know that certain conditions are fulfilled.",
