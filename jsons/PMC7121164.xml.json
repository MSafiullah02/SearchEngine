In the case of 2\u2032-O-ribose methylation of rRNA, the methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MTase) fibrillarin utilizes small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), so-called Box C/D snoRNAs that guide the enzyme complex to complementary regions of the rRNA for methylation [2]. Base methylation of rRNA and tRNA as well as 2\u2032-O-ribose methylation of tRNA are carried out by position/sequence-specific methyltransferases independent of snoRNAs. For example, in E. coli uracil-5-methyltransferase (trmA) and guanine-7-methyltransferase (yggH/trmB) methylate specific bases in tRNA such as uridine 54 (m5U54) or guanosine 46 (m7G46), respectively [3\u20135]. In contrast, the Gm18-2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (spoU/trmH) methylates the 2\u2032-O-position of a conserved guanosine at position 18 of tRNA (Gm18) [6].",

Also pseudouridine-containing or 2\u2032-O-methylated synthetic RNA loses its immunostimulatory capacity via RIG-I [19]. We and others have further demonstrated that 2\u2032-O-methylation of synthetic RNA and tRNA not only renders TLR7 ligands non-immunostimulatory but also converts modified RNA into a TLR7 antagonist [23\u201325].",
