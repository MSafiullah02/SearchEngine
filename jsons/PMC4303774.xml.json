To obtain insight into laboratory testing during the outbreak, the sample reception list in JRL was analyzed (Figure 1). There was a striking increase of diagnostic requests during April, which was mainly caused by samples from Jeddah (Figure 1A). From 1 January to 28 April 2014, JRL received 6285 samples for RT-PCR testing for MERS-CoV. Of these samples, 5828 were received since 26 March, the date when the first case in the Jeddah outbreak was tested. This suggests a 36.8-fold increase of the monthly workload in April. The maximal number of samples received in a single day was 481. Almost half of all positive testing samples during the Jeddah outbreak (82 of 168) stemmed from King Fahd Hospital (KFH). The rate of samples with positive tests from KFH seemed to increase earlier than in other hospitals in the city (Figure 1B). Over the course of 4 weeks in April, the fraction of positive RT-PCR results in samples from Jeddah as well as samples from all cities did not vary significantly (Supplementary Table 1). Although the laboratory entry list did not identify the symptom status of patients, it indicated by presence of a patient identifier code whether cases were in hospital or likely part of a contact investigation (Table 1). There was a marked increase of contact investigations in Jeddah vs other locations. Expectedly, the proportion of samples with low viral loads (indicated by high cycle threshold [Ct] values) was high in contact investigations (Figure 1C and 1D). Studies of reliability of laboratory procedures did not reveal any evidence for generic background contamination in the laboratory (Supplementary Data 1).\n\n",

Further partial sequencing of this virus did not yield any other double peaks, suggesting the ongoing formation of quasispecies as described before [16], rather than simultaneous infection with 2 viruses. The sequences from a US patient and a patient in Riyadh with known travel histories to Jeddah had Jeddah-typical SNP patterns (Table 2). In contrast, viruses detected in Jeddah 1 month and 5 months before the outbreak did not cluster with the Jeddah-type outbreak viruses. A virus detected in Riyadh (SA2014_158) was related to camel viruses sharing a recent common ancestor with Jeddah-type outbreak viruses, but was distinct in its SNP pattern.\n",

Our initial sequence analyses communicated during the ongoing outbreak provided a preliminary idea of the molecular epidemiology, with outbreak viruses forming a homogeneous, monophyletic clade [17]. Paraphyly of concurrent viruses is expected when infections are independently acquired from a diversified source population such as expected in animal reservoirs. In Riyadh, concurrently circulating viruses were indeed distributed across at least 6 different clades, suggesting that these infections resulted from increased zoonotic activity or introduction of human viruses from other regions. One larger virus cluster was observed in Riyadh, associated with 1 specific hospital, suggesting nosocomial transmission (clade 2). The patient exported to Indiana had worked in this hospital, whereas the cases in the Netherlands were hospitalized in Madinah but not Riyadh [14, 15]. This suggests unnoticed transmission links such as infected patients transferred between hospitals, or acquisition from common zoonotic sources.",

            "text": "Interestingly, one of the viruses seen in Riyadh resembled camel viruses in close relationship to Jeddah-type strains. These viruses may have been widely distributed in camels by late 2013 to early 2014, as they were detected in Taif (southeast of Jeddah) and in Qatar on the eastern Arabian Peninsula [16, 18]. Viruses encountered in Jeddah shortly before the outbreak such as Jeddah-1 or Jeddah_C6664 were clearly distinct, suggesting that the outbreak might have been initiated by the introduction of Jeddah-type viruses into camels in the region. The monophyly and similarity of outbreak viruses favors the idea that the subsequent transmission took place in humans. The regional restriction of outbreak viruses matches our earlier observation of low transmissibility between humans in nonnosocomial settings such as household contact clusters [19]. Despite a documented transmission from Jeddah to the capital, Riyadh, there was no evidence of further human-to-human spread in Riyadh. From the analysis of SNP patterns, it was concluded that all Jeddah-type viruses were homogenous, without evidence for concomitant circulation of other strains during the outbreak. Nevertheless, our preliminary sequencing studies found no relevant genetic changes sufficient to explain an altered epidemic pattern [17]. As we have now been able to isolate live viruses, we can provide a first side-by-side comparison of different viral strains of MERS-CoV. Of note, these virus isolates were representative of 2 likely nosocomial outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh, both causing international spread of the virus to the United States, the Netherlands, and Greece. Cell culture experiments yielded no evidence for changes in viral replication or immune escape. The absence of differences in serum neutralization disfavors antigenic variability as a promoter of transmissibility. As the selected viruses represent major branches of the known MERS-CoV tree, these data additionally suggest the absence of serotypes in MERS-CoV, which is reassuring regarding the prospects to develop immunization approaches.",

We have obtained no evidence suggesting that concentrations of shed virus might have changed. A subjective trend toward higher peak (but not average) concentrations later into the outbreak may be explained by increased disease awareness in hospitals, leading to an earlier investigation of suspected cases. Similar observations were made during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong where cases were detected with less delay after the outbreak had progressed for some time [20]. The absence of changes in average virus concentrations makes it unlikely for the virus to have changed its transmissibility and virulence over the course of the outbreak.",

In this light, our analysis of laboratory statistics is highly suggestive of an outbreak fueled by the healthcare setting. Not only did about half of all patients with a positive diagnosis pertain to one particular hospital, but the first peak case counts in this hospital also predated increases elsewhere, and new peaks were followed by peaks of cases in other hospitals. This pattern is highly suggestive of an epidemiological hotspot where the virus is amplified and from where limited transmission chains are seeded. Indeed, KFH is the largest communal hospital in Jeddah and serves as the primary care center for all patients attending the Ministry of Health healthcare system, as well as for a large fraction of expatriate workers in the city. It is reassuring that the number of new cases in KFH declined toward the end of the study period. This trend started even before changes such as the closure of emergency rooms and the transfer of infected patients were implemented, pointing to the possibility that transmission may have been limited mainly by heightened awareness of the disease among healthcare workers and patients. Again, a similar effect has been documented during the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong [20].",

As shown in our assessment of sample receptions, the huge amount of laboratory requests during peak phases of the epidemic caused an overload on laboratory capacities, without a significant increase of the fraction of requests that were confirmed virus-positive. A low predictive value of clinical suspicion is caused by an insufficient case definition or lack of adherence to the case definition, as is suggested by a high fraction of tests in cases without a proper hospital registration number. Unjustified RT-PCR testing raises the likelihood of human error. As far as possible, we have assessed the technical capabilities of JRL and found no general issues of cross-contamination. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude issues elsewhere in the logistics chain, such as near the bedside where diagnostic samples may have been handled in bulk. The high similarity of all Jeddah-type viruses will make it impossible to resolve potential contamination sources retrospectively by sequencing of stored samples. Nevertheless, a certain rate of positive test results in asymptomatic persons might be considered plausible, as unnoticed replication has been shown for patients with SARS-CoV whose RNA was detected in exposed healthcare workers with no or mild symptoms, as well as in our recent study on household contacts of MERS-CoV cases [19, 21].
