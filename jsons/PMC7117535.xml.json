            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the alphacoronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales), is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that causes disease in swine with great financial losses (Chen et al., 2012). The PEDV genome comprises two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoding two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) and five other proteins, spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). Several mutations have been identified in the S (spike) 1 region in recent years. Small intestinal epithelial cells in vivo are primarily attacked by PEDV, which causes acute watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and anorexia in pigs of all ages (Li et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014). After first being discovered in the 1970s in Europe, PEDV became widespread with significant mortality and morbidity, particularly in nursing piglets (Langel et al., 2016). Although PEDV vaccines have been available in China, the preventive effect is not evident and infectious cases still occur in the swine industry. Therefore, new anti-PEDV methods are urgently needed.",

            "text": "For over 50 years, lipid components, including cholesterol and its derivatives, have been studied as important structural components of physiological processes. Crucial cellular processes require the maintenance of sterol homeostasis. As a family of transcription factors, the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are considered modulators of lipid biosynthesis. One antiviral lipid effector, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), is reportedly able to suppress cholesterol biosynthesis by repressing the activation of SREBPs (Holmes et al., 2011). Newly translated SREBPs bind the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Under conditions of sterol depletion, this SREBP\u2013SCAP complex is transported to the Golgi apparatus, and site-1 protease (S1P) and site-2 protease (S2P) are used to cleave SREBP into its mature transcription factor form (Olsen et al., 2011). Under conditions of excess lipid, SCAP undergoes a conformational change that causes it to bind to insulin-induced genes (INSIGs). Retention of the SREBP\u2013SCAP complex in the ER is accelerated by 25HC, not via direct action with SCAP, but through the overexpression of INSIGs that control the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, a degenerative-feedback mechanism for the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis has been recognized, which is associated with the expression of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) (Singaravelu et al., 2015). Rapid proteasomal degradation can be effected by HMGCR through high cellular 25HC levels, independent of SREBPs (Singaravelu et al., 2015). Therefore, 25HC has been regarded as an inhibitor of cholesterol.",

Interferons (IFNs) have been found to induce hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that have been identified as a broader range of inhibitors against various viruses, such as protein kinase R, viperin, IFITM1, ribonuclease, and MX protein (Raniga and Liang, 2018). Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) encodes an ER-associated enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of cholesterol to 25HC (Blanc et al., 2013; Hotter et al., 2013). Recent reports have revealed that CH25H inhibits many enveloped viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Liu et al., 2013), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Moog et al., 1998), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Anggakusuma et al., 2015), Ebola virus (EBOV) (Liu et al., 2013), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Song et al., 2017), pseudorabies virus (PRV) (Wang et al., 2017) and Zika virus (Li et al., 2017a), as well as some non-enveloped viruses, such as human rotavirus and human rhinovirus (Fessler, 2016). However, the antiviral effects and mechanisms of CH25H and 25HC on PEDV are still unclear.",

In the present study, we investigated whether PEDV infection could upregulate CH25H expression in Vero cells. Vero cells seeded in 24-well plates were infected with the PEDV YZ strain (at an MOI [multiplicity of infection] of 0.1) containing 8 \u03bcg/mL trypsin, and incubated for 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. The mRNA levels of CH25H and PEDV N protein were measured by qRT-PCR. In contrast, CH25H mRNA levels in Vero cells were significantly downregulated by PEDV infection with increasing time (Fig. 1\nA) and PEDV N protein mRNA levels were significantly increased with time (Fig. 1B). In addition, Vero cells were treated with 20,000 IU/mL IFN-\u03b1 (Song et al., 2017) and incubated for 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 36 h at 37 \u00b0C. The CH25H and MX2 mRNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR. The results indicated that the CH25H mRNA levels apparently showed no fluctuations. In addition, CH25H was evidently not an ISG in Vero cells (Fig. 1C), and MX2 mRNA levels were induced by IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 1D).",

At present, many anti-PEDV therapies are in general use, including recombinant Lactobacillus casei expressing dendritic cell-targeting peptide fused with the COE protein of PEDV (Langel et al., 2016), and IFN-lambda, which preferably inhibits PEDV infection (Li et al., 2017b).

In the present study, the overexpression of CH25H or 25HC inhibited PEDV infection by impeding virion entry, which is similar to that observed in PRRSV. In addition, the catalytically inactive form of CH25H retains antiviral action against HCV and PRRSV (Chen et al., 2014). We further investigated the antiviral activities of CH25H-M on PEDV. Similar results were observed, such that CH25H-M still restricted PEDV infection, although the antiviral effect was attenuated. These findings demonstrate that CH25H does not depend entirely on enzymatic activity against PEDV.",

Overexpression and knockdown of CH25H indicated that it has superior antiviral activity against PEDV. Further study revealed that CH25H-M retained the effect of restriction on PEDV replication and 25HC inhibited different viral strains of PEDV. In addition, we found that replication of TGEV, another coronavirus, was also suppressed by CH25H and 25HC in ST cells. These findings provide novel research insights for the future control of porcine intestinal coronaviruses, including PEDV and TGEV, and even other members of the Coronaviridae family.",
