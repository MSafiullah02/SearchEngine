Apart from causing a latent infection of basal keratinocytes, HPV is also known for inducing benign warts and diverse cancers such as anal, cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and rectal cancer, as well as head and neck tumours [1, 2]. HPV high-risk types, including the most oncogenic type HPV16, are causative agents of cervical cancer. This kind of tumour is known as the most prevalent viral infection of the female genital tract with ranking as the fourth most frequent cancer in women [3, 4]. HPVs are composed of an icosahedral capsid harbouring the major capsid protein L1 and the minor capsid protein L2, and a circular double-stranded DNA genome [5].",

A direct association of CD9 with the metalloproteinase ADAM17 was reported in monocytic and endothelial cells. Through that interaction, CD9 was shown to negatively regulate ADAM17 shedding activity, resulting in reduced release of its substrates, the tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) [31]. This functional interaction between CD9 and ADAM17 has been subsequently confirmed in other cell types and for additional ADAM17 substrates. In this regard, Tsukamoto et al. reported that CD9 negatively regulates the shedding of the substrate LR11, a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family which has a key role in cell migration, adhesion, and drug resistance, in various leukaemia cell lines [32]. Furthermore, Liu et al. have recently shown the direct association of CD9 with ADAM17 in keratinocytes and confirmed that CD9 exerts negative regulatory effects on this metalloproteinase resulting in diminished shedding of its substrate heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) and reduced activation of EGFR/ERK signalling pathway, crucially affecting keratinocyte migration and wound healing [33].",

As earlier described, control siRNA-treated HeLa cells showed prominent HPV16-CD63 colocalization in vesicular structures (Fig. 1b, upper panel). By contrast, CD9-depleted cells showed only a minor colocalization of L1 and CD63 while viral capsids localized in the cell periphery (Fig. 1b, lower panel) suggesting that HPV16 uptake and trafficking to MVBs are disturbed. To verify the crucial role of CD9 in regulating early HPV16 trafficking, a prerequisite for capsid disassembly, we examined the quantity of disassembled capsids in endosomes. Here, we used the disassembly-specific monoclonal antibody L1-7 that recognizes a linear L1-epitope, which is only accessible after capsid disassembly [13]. CD9 knockdown led to a strong reduction of L1-7 positive pixels (Fig. 1c) again demonstrating the functional relevance of CD9 for HPV16 entry.",

Using equal protein amounts in the cell lysates and the same exposure times for all tested cell lines, we found that HaCaT cells exhibit a four- to ten-fold higher CD9 expression level, when compared to HeLa and NHEK cells, respectively. These results suggest that the contrary outcome in infection rates in HeLa and NHEK versus HaCaT cells is associated with the different intracellular expression level of CD9. Hereby, both a particularly high (HaCaT) and the absence of CD9 protein (CD9-siRNA depleted HeLa and NHEK) seemed to have a negative effect on the infection rate.

Our data uncovered a significant decrease in the amount of released TGF\u03b1-AP into the supernatant of HeLa cells after CD9 overexpression (Fig. 5b). This effect was comparable to its effect on HPV16 PsV infection as shown above (Fig. 4). Conversely, depletion of CD9 in HaCaT cells led to a significant increase in the amount of released TGF\u03b1-AP (Fig. 5c), which again corresponds to the effect of CD9 siRNA on infection rates in these cells.",

Indeed, modulation of the endogenous CD9 level in HeLa cells resembles the results obtained in HPV16 PsVs infection assays (for infection assays in CD9 overexpressing HeLas see Figs. 4b and S1; for knockdown see Fig. 2a). This was investigated by overexpressing and depleting CD9 in HeLa cells and we observed that both treatments induced a significant decrease of phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 levels (Fig. 6).

Subsequent quantitative analysis on endogenous CD9 levels revealed that significantly lower amounts of CD9 are expressed in HeLa and NHEK when compared to HaCaT cells. This observation led to the speculation that a low level of endogenous CD9, as it is the case in nontreated HeLa and NHEK cells, promotes HPV16 infection, whereas high CD9 amounts, naturally present in HaCaT cells, impair HPV16 infection. This notion was further confirmed by the dose-dependent decrease of HPV16 infection in HeLa cells following CD9 overexpression, thereby mimicking the high CD9 levels naturally present in HaCaT cells.",

Functional analyses revealed a repressive function of high CD9 expression levels on ADAM17 shedding activity in different epithelial cells. This is in line with the previously reported results showing CD9-mediated negative regulation of ADAM17 shedding activity in different cells [31, 33, 56]. Furthermore, modulation of the CD9 amounts, both through its increase or decrease, led to a reduction of ERK1/2 activation in HeLa cells. These effects correlate with those on infection rates. Moreover and similarly to our comparative infection analyses in different cells, opposing effects on ERK activation upon CD9 depletion were observed depending on the cell line under study [49, 50]. Differences in endogenous CD9 expression levels might explain these contradictory results and support our conclusions drawn from our infection data.",

The sheddase activity of ADAM17 has been proposed to be also regulated through other factors, such as interaction with integrin \u03b15\u03b21 [57, 58]. Associations between the sheddase and this integrin resulted in the inhibition of both the adhesive capacity of integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and the metalloproteinase activity of ADAM17 due to steric hindrance leading to the decreased accessibility of its catalytic site for the substrates. Moreover, the formation of tri-molecular complexes comprising CD9, ADAM17, and integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and interactions between laminin-binding integrins have been described [28, 56, 59]. Therefore, varying expression levels of CD9 could influence integrin localization and activity that might also contribute to the observed changes in HPV16 infection rates, as integrins are important proviral factors contributing to virus binding and signalling.",

Likewise, during influenza A virus (IAV) and coronavirus (CoV) entry, CD9 mediates the close proximity of a protease and the virus enabling the cleavage of viral proteins which is a precondition for infection [24, 60, 61]. Similar concepts of the regulation of signaling pathways by tetraspanins is summarized in Kummer et al. in this issue [62].

Likewise, an almost complete loss of CD9 in the microdomain might enhance the free diffusion of both protease and substrates but at the cost of reducing their effective local concentrations on the plasma membrane required for the optimal accessibility of substrates to the catalytic site of ADAM17, again leading to impaired shedding. Only a low level of CD9 would then ensure the proper membrane composition for storage, diffusion, and accessibility of ADAM17 and its EGFR-activating substrates.

The data were analysed with two-tailed unpaired t test (*p \u2264 0.05, **p \u2264 0.01, ***p \u2264 0.001, ns not significant). c CD9 depletion increases ADAM17-mediated TGF\u03b1 release. HaCaT cells were depleted of CD9 and the next day transfected with alkaline phosphatase-tagged TGF-\u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1-AP) plasmid for 24 h. The next day AP activity was assessed and served as a measure for released ADAM17-specific substrate TGF\u03b1-AP. AP activity is shown as a percentage and the mean for control siRNA-transfected cells (ctr. si) was set to 100% \u00b1 SEM. The data were analysed with two-tailed unpaired t test (*p \u2264 0.05, **p \u2264 0.01, ***p \u2264 0.001, ns not significant)",
