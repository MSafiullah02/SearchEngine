However, because many of these pathogens must be handled in biosafety level, 3 or 4 containment laboratories, research and development of antivirals or vaccines against these diseases are often impeded. Alternative approaches to address this issue have been vigorously pursued, particularly the use of pseudoviruses in place of wild-type viruses. As pseudoviruses have been deprived of certain gene sequences of the virulent virus, they can be handled in biosafety level 2 laboratories. Importantly, the envelopes of these viral particles may have similar conformational structures to those of the wild-type viruses, making it feasible to conduct mechanistic investigation on viral entry and to evaluate potential neutralizing antibodies. However, a variety of challenging issues remain, including the production of a sufficient pseudovirus yield and the inability to produce an appropriate pseudotype of certain viruses.

As such, an additional plasmid or stable cell line expressing the surface proteins is needed to make the pseudovirus. 2 Pseudoviruses are capable of infecting susceptible cells, but they only replicate for 1 round in the infected host cells. 3 Compared with wild-type (WT) viruses, pseudoviruses can be safely handled in biosafety level (BSL)-2 laboratories 4 and are usually easier to manipulate experimentally. 5 Nevertheless, the conformational structure of pseudoviral surface proteins bears high similarity to that of the native viral proteins, and these surface proteins can effectively mediate viral entry into host cells. Therefore, pseudoviruses are widely used for the study of cellular tropism, 6 receptor recognition, 7 and virus inhibition, 8 as well as for developing and evaluating antibodies 9 and vaccines. 10 In addition, data from in vitro pseudovirus-based antiviral assays and in vivo biodistribution analyses have been found to correlate very well with the results generated by using live WT viruses. 11, 12 As pseudoviruses have usually been engineered to carry reporter genes, it is much easier to perform quantitative analyses on these viruses than on WT viruses, 13 and the number of pseudovirus-infected cells has been shown to be directly proportional to reporter gene expression.

Sandrin et al cotransfected 293 T cells with the pSIV-12 packaging vector, pSIV-T1 + transfer vector, and RD114/ TR expressing envelope protein. The SIV-based pseudoviruses demonstrated high transduction efficiency in primary blood lymphocytes and CD34 + cells derived from either humans or macaques. 54 These investigators also used a pR4SA-green fluorescent protein vector and a pSIV-3 + packaging vector to determine the factors that contribute to the intracellular and cell surface formation of various target viruses and the yield of pseudoviruses. 55 Moore et al used an SIV packaging system to construct a pseudotyped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to screen anti-SARS-CoV compounds. 56 In theory, the SIV-based pseudovirus may be safer than its HIV counterpart as well as resistant to preexisting neutralizing antibodies against the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), or gibbon ape leukemia virus; when pseudotyped with the RD114 (feline endogenous virus) envelope glycoprotein, the SIV-based pseudovirus demonstrated augmented transduction efficiency in blood cells from both humans and primates.

When compared with the EBOV pseudovirus packaged by the HIV system, the EBOV pseudovirus packaged by the FIV system had a higher titer. Apparently, the mutation of the GP proteins contributed to higher pseudoviral titers and better safety of the resulting pseudoviruses. 57 By using the FIV packaging system as a backbone, other investigators have developed various pseudotyped viruses for SARS-CoV, VSV, RV, and Ross River virus.

Scott et al optimized the production of equine influenza-HA-pseudotyped viruses via the addition of exogenous neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens to allow the release of nascent pseudovirus particles. 111 These observations indicate that the packaging conditions should be optimized to improve the pseudovirus yield on a case-by-case basis.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": "Notably, Duehr J et al indicated that some anti-EBOV glycoprotein monoclonal antibodies could neutralize and protect against pseudotyped VSV-EBOV but were nonneutralizing against WT EBOV. 118 Recently, pseudoviral systems have also been explored for the analysis of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, which might be a better choice than the use of target cells transfected with a DNA plasmid. The success in employing pseudovirus in ADCC assays may be because the surface proteins of pseudovirus largely retain their native conformation and, following infection, a portion of these proteins remains on the surface of the target cells. In the pseudovirus-based ADCC assay, target cells are first infected with the pseudovirus, followed by the addition of monoclonal antibody and modified Jurkat cells (effector cells). If the monoclonal antibody has ADCC activity, the Fab portion will bind to the target cell, while its Fc will bind and activate the modified Jurkat cells, which have been engineered to stably express the Fc receptor, V158 (high affinity) variant in addition to luciferase under the control of an NFAT response element. 52 4.3 | Drug screening Various studies have been carried out by using pseudoviruses to screen small-molecule compounds including those against LASV, EBOV, MARV, SARS-CoV, NiV, and influenza H5N1. 119,120 Wang et al used pseudotyped MARV, influenza H5N1, and LASV to screen 1200 small-molecule compounds that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat other medical conditions. It was found that some of these compounds have a broad range of antiviral activities against MARV, influenza H5N1, and LASV. 8 By using pseudovirus, Elshabrawy et al were able to select a small molecule compound that had a broad spectrum of antiviral activity against SARS-CoV, MARV, Hendra virus, and NiV.
