However, few large systematic studies have addressed host and viral factors for severe respiratory illness caused by HCoV, and even fewer data describing outcomes in immunocompromised children are available. In this study, we evaluated the risk factors for LRTD and severe LRTD in a large cohort of pediatric patients, including a significant number of immunocompromised children. Younger age and presence of an underlying pulmonary disorder, a respiratory copathogen (especially RSV), and an immunocompromised state were associated with increased risk of LRTD or severe LRTD in multivariable models. Striking seasonality was found; all 4 strains were present predominantly from December through March every year, and clinical outcomes among patients infected with each of the 4 strains were similar. The expansion of immunocompromised populations has raised concern about whether these patients are at risk for severe HCoV respiratory tract disease [22, 23] . Recent data suggested a significant association between HCoV-related LRTD and a need for respiratory support and increased risk of death in immunocompromised adults [12] . Previous pediatric studies of HCoV infection have included small numbers of immunocompromised children [10, 24, 25] ; few data from studies that focused specifically on this high-risk population exist. In our study, an immunocompromised state was associated with a higher risk of severe LRTD after we adjusted for clinical and virologic covariates.

The age distributions in the immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised groups differed. We assume that the broader age distribution in the immunocompromised group reflects the overall age distribution of the immunocompromised population, although these data were not available to us. A prospective longitudinal cohort study examined the effect of 3 HCoV strains on children younger than 5 years and found a substantial burden of LRTD, especially in children younger than 2 years [27] . Lee and Storch [9] characterized clinical features of hospitalized children younger than 5 years infected with HCoV strains OC43 and NL63. The presence of congenital heart disease and a chronic respiratory disorder was associated with severe disease. These reports are consistent with our findings. The overall rates of respiratory copathogens in our study (22% in immunocompromised children and 31% in nonimmunocompromised children) are lower than those of previous studies in children (35%-75%) [9, [28] [29] [30] . Conflicting data regarding the clinical implications of detecting multiple respiratory viruses exist. In children, detection of multiple viruses has been associated with less-severe disease [31] , but the opposite result was reported for adults [32] . The specific combination of respiratory copathogens might be important. In this study, we found that compared to HCoV alone, the odds of LRTD or severe LRTD were much higher in children with RSV coinfection than in those with coinfection with a non-RSV copathogen. This result was likely driven by the higher pathogenicity of RSV, as indicated by previous studies [9, 28] .

Two recent large prospective studies of symptomatic patients with respiratory viruses compared to asymptomatic controls suggested that most of the HCoV detections were associated with symptomatic illness [11, 39] . Nonetheless, the presence of HCoV does not necessarily indicate its etiologic role in clinical symptoms. Furthermore, testing bias by the attending physician was still possible despite the fact that we investigated only patients who visited our institution for acute care. However, most physicians would have a lower threshold for testing (ie, for less severe presentations) in a population at high risk; thus, the positive relationship between an immunocompromised state and severe LRTD would be weakened rather than accentuated.
