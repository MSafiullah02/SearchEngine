At the National Institute of Oncology of Rabat, we share the same guiding principles for team safety. However, we would like to draw attention to time-delay risk on screening symptoms for novel coronavirus (COVID-19), especially in cancer patients.",

Afterwards, in the recovery room, there was a de novo worsening clinical respiratory condition, in addition to a thorough anamnestic investigation, at which time the patient revealed a contact situation and exposure to a COVID-19\u2013positive patient in the family.",
