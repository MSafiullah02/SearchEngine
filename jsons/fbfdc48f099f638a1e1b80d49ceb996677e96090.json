The principal aim of the project was to gather as much information concerning small companion animal practice, infectious disease and vaccination as possible, to form a firm basis for the recommendations to be made subsequently. To that end, in 2012 to 2013, the VGG undertook a series of fact-finding visits to Japan (Tokyo and Osaka), India (Delhi and Mumbai), China (Beijing and Shanghai) and Thailand (Bangkok).

            "text": "In 2012, the VGG began a new 2-year project that focussed on the vaccination requirements of small companion animals in Asia. The project, which was completed in late 2013, was born of the recognition that there are many unique political, educational and scientific challenges in the Asian countries that may not have been addressed specifically by the previous documents produced by the VGG. The present paper represents the final outcome from this Asian study. It summarises the key challenges faced by small companion animal veterinary practitioners in those parts of Asia studied (many of which may be extrapolated to other Asian Recommendations on vaccination for Asian small animal practitioners animal infectious disease, medicine and surgery. In India and China, veterinary schools are charged with providing practitioners to service the production animal industry and public health. Very little tuition related to small companion animal disease is provided and few academic staff have strong interest or expertise in small animal clinical studies. Therefore, practitioners working in this sector have largely gained their knowledge via postgraduate education. With the exception of some individuals who have worked abroad in other Asian countries or further afield, this postgraduate knowledge is largely gained from CE events provided by the veterinary associations. In Japan and Thailand, there is significantly greater development of small companion animal curricula, supported by well-equipped teaching hospitals and designated academic staff; however, even in these countries, there are relatively few veterinary clinical specialists holding North American or European board certification, and the Asian Board of Veterinary Specialties, and associated speciality colleges, has only been established relatively recently. It was also notable that academics in the Japanese and Thai schools highlighted that there was less than optimal teaching of core clinical practice skills related to the client consultation and the delivery of vaccinations within that setting.",

            "text": "In the four countries visited, some common themes emerged concerning small companion animal infectious diseases. With the exception of canine rabies (which should be notified to the OIE, although it is widely recognised that gross under-reporting occurs), there is little or no formal surveillance for small companion animal infectious diseases conducted by government, industry or academia. With some notable exceptions, particularly in Japan, there are very few academic staff who conduct research or publish in the area of small companion animal infectious diseases or vaccinology. This also means that practitioners in these countries have insufficient access to research-led diagnostic laboratories that might help confirm diagnoses of infectious diseases in challenging, individual patients. Private diagnostic laboratories are also relatively uncommon in some countries; for example, an international group has only recently established the first veterinary diagnostic laboratory in Shanghai. In India, there are private laboratories only in Delhi and Mumbai. Many practitioners therefore rely on in-practice diagnostic test kits, often manufactured in Asia, for detection of infectious agent antigen or antibody. The VGG identified few peer-reviewed publications dealing with small companion animal infectious diseases and vaccinology that originated from India, China and Thailand. Some key manuscripts, brought to the attention of the VGG, are given as Appendix 3. This situation, which is particularly acute in India and China, relates largely to two factors: (1) academics are not encouraged or supported to investigate diseases of small companion animals within institutions that have a production animal focus and (2) there are virtually no sources of research funding that might permit the investigation of small companion animal diseases.",

Given the importance of canine rabies in Asia, the VGG also met with the Deputy Director of the International Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in the Asia-Pacific region, the Chairman of the Animal Welfare Board of India, and the founder of a major non-governmental organisation undertaking a rabies control programme in Sri Lanka (the Blue Paw Trust). The formal meetings were supplemented with site visits to 12 small animal practices (of a range of size and standards) in India and China. Outwith these committee visits, during 2013, the Chair of the VGG (M. J.

In all of the Asian countries visited, most practitioners continue to adhere to an annual revaccination programme in which all core and noncore components are administered, often with multi-component products containing numerous antigens. In part, this is reinforced by the erroneous belief that in areas of \"high infectious disease pressure\", individual animals may be better protected by more frequent administration of vaccines. Although practitioners understand the concept of \"herd immunity\" in the context of mass vaccination campaigns for the control of canine rabies, there is little sense that herd immunity applies also to other key infectious diseases.",

In most Asian countries, vaccines are supplied by the major international companies and by national manufacturers.

            "text": "A further issue, identified by the VGG during discussions and practice visits, relates to the concept of \"vaccine husbandry\" in some Asian countries. It is our belief that \"vaccine failure\" due to inappropriate storage or administration of products in the practice is common in some Asian countries and that this again reflects a lack of fundamental education in this area. In some countries, vaccines are transported long distances from the point of manufacture or importation to the veterinary practice. Most practitioners are well aware of the concept of the \"cold chain\". However, practitioners may be too quick to blame a breakdown in the cold chain before delivery to the practice for vaccine failure and do not necessarily appreciate the monitoring measures that are put in place by the suppliers of international vaccines. The VGG has identified a number of practices related to vaccine storage and usage by practitioners, which have been highlighted in simple guidelines for correct vaccine husbandry (Table 3) . Table 3 . Vaccine husbandry: key points for veterinary practitioners \u2022 Vaccines (and particularly adjuvanted vaccines) have an optimum storage temperature that is usually between 2 and 8\u00b0C (domestic refrigerators should be maintained at 4\u00baC). These products should not be frozen or positioned adjacent to the freezer compartment of the refrigerator, and refrigerator temperature should be monitored regularly. Vaccines transported into the field should also be subject to continuation of the \"cold chain\". \u2022 Freeze-dried vaccines should be reconstituted immediately before use with appropriate diluent or liquid vaccine given concurrently (as per the manufacturer's recommendations). It is bad practice and contraindicated to make up the vaccines anticipated to be used during the day first thing in the morning. Some vaccine components (e.g. CDV, FHV-1) are particularly labile in this regard and so these vaccines may not induce adequate immunity if not reconstituted just before use. \u2022 Vaccines should only be mixed together in the same syringe if this is specified as acceptable in the manufacturer's datasheets.",

Core vaccines are those that every dog or cat must receive as they protect the animal from prevalent diseases that may be lethal or induce significant morbidity. Non-core vaccines are those that might be administered to individual animals whose geographical location or lifestyle places them at risk of contracting those particular infections. Non-core vaccines are not required by every animal and should not be used where there is no evidence that the related disease exists in a country. The VGG also describes some vaccines as not recommended (where there is judged to be insufficient scientific evidence to justify their use). For individual-owned pet animals in a domestic environment, the current WSAVA vaccination guidelines should be applied when quality-assured MLV core vaccines are used in a practice. The VGG is unable to comment on whether nationally produced vaccines confer equivalent protection to those available internationally because of a lack of published, peerreviewed data.",

In many countries, there is a limited range of international multicomponent canine vaccines incorporating both core and noncore antigens, and where feline vaccines are available at all, the product range is similarly limited. Practitioners should begin to understand that while current datasheet recommendations for international MLV core vaccines recommend annual revaccination of adult animals, the same vaccines are given triennially in many other countries. Practitioners and their national associations should therefore continue to lobby industry and government regulators for changes that will bring recommendations concerning international products into line with current global standards and practices. Table 5 presents some pragmatic recommendations that may assist Asian practitioners make the transition from the current situation to the newer global trends in small animal vaccinology. Practitioners should opt for a quality-assured vaccine product range that enables them to deliver core components [i.e. canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus-2 (CAV-2) and canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2) for dogs; feline parvovirus (FPV), feline to individual animals. With respect to international core MLV vaccines, key changes to current protocols would be introduction of a final puppy and kitten primary core vaccination at or after 16 weeks of age and revaccination of adult dogs and cats with MLV core vaccines no more frequently than every 3 years. The unnecessary annual use of international MLV core revaccination may be regarded as an inappropriate use of limited client financial resources that may be better applied to address other health issues in the pet. Even though the international products in most Asian countries do not carry datasheet recommendations for use in this way, it would be useful if local professional guidance permitted practitioners to use these products \"off label\" with informed client consent. This approach was used successfully for a number of years in other countries before datasheet recommendations were updated. As discussed earlier, the VGG hopes that in due course the international core MLV vaccines will have datasheet changes made in the Asian countries.",

In the case of mass vaccination campaigns, the VGG accepts the logic of annual revaccination of populations within which long-term identification of individual vaccinated animals is impractical. In such free-roaming populations, there is often high turnover of the animals, with new puppies being born and older dogs dying during the period between vaccination campaigns.

The annual health check concept is rapidly gaining popularity in many countries of the world, where it has been proven to be advantageous for the business of veterinary practice. There is no reason why this concept should not be equally well received by the affluent urban clients of Asian veterinary practitioners and the VGG would encourage the national associations to provide education in, and endorsement for, the concept. Even in a less affluent rural community, the small animal practitioner should consider aspects of nutrition and ecto-and endoparasite control at the same time as deciding on a vaccination protocol for the individual pet animal. In some parts of Asia, it has been observed that a high proportion of pups and kittens carry high parasitic burdens and that it would be a sensible approach to deal with these before vaccination, in order to achieve the greatest possible protective immune response following administration of a vaccine.",

Outbreaks might occur among puppies that did not obtain sufficient MDA as the bitch was not effectively vaccinated. In contrast, where puppy vaccination is not performed according to WSAVA guidelines (i.e. with a final puppy vaccine at 16 weeks of age or older), there is a risk that some puppies may be unprotected if the bitch does have a high level of MDA. Finally, there are some breeds of dog (e.g. Rottweiler, Dobermann) that have a greater risk of being genetic non-responders to these vaccines. Good husbandry, hygiene and nutrition all play a role in minimising disease outbreaks in kennels.",

Most non-responders will fail to seroconvert to just one of the core vaccine antigens (i.e. CDV, CAV or CPV-2). You may attempt to revaccinate and retest that dog, but a true non-responder (or low-responder) may still not respond to revaccination. Such animals simply lack the immunological ability to make an immune response to that particular antigen and will never respond to that vaccine component.
