Recently, a YHV strain was detected in Litopenaeus vannamei cultivated in Mexican farms that lacked virus-associated mortalities or epizooties, and the animals were apparently healthy. The identity of the virus was con\u00a2rmed by sequencing replicative and structural proteinencoding regions and comparing with homologous virus sequences. Phylogenic relationships and genetic distances were also determined and, although some di\u00a1erences were observed, an in\u00a3uence on virulence was uncertain. In addition, the expression levels of several transcripts (3CL PRO , POL, GP64 and GP116) were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction during an experimental infection. Although the transcript showed varying kinetics, viral genes were expressed in infected L. vannamei, demonstrating the replicative capability of thisYHV strain.",

However, bacterial and viral infections represent a major constraint a\u00a1ecting the industry due to signi\u00a2cant economic losses. The yellow head virus (YHV) and the white spot syndrome virus have been reported to be the most dangerous viruses for cultivated shrimp (Durand,Tang & Lightner 2000) , and besides virulence, the epizooties are typically associated with poor management and/or environmental conditions. Yellow head virus epizooties cause up to 100% mortality 3^5 days after virus introduction (Wongteerasupaya, Sriurairatana, Vicker, Akrajamorn, Boonsaeng, Panyim, Tassanakajon, Withyachumnarnkul & Flegel 1995) , and an e\u00a1ective treatment is not available. In addition to its high virulence and infectiveness, YHV is a very risky virus (Boonyaratpalin, Supamattaya, Kasornchandra, Direkbusaracom, Aekpanithanpong & Chantanachookin 1993 ), as it is also able to naturally infect other shrimp populations, which can then act as natural reservoirs (Lu,Tapay, Brock & Loh1994; Ma, Overstreet & Jovonovich 2009 ).",

However, by genomic taxonomy, YHV is classi\u00a2ed as an Okavirus, a member of the Roniviridae family that characteristically has a (1)ssRNA genome (Cowley, Dimmock, Wongteerasupaya, Boonsaeng, Panyim & Walker 1999; Cowley, Dimmock, Spann & Walker 2000; Sittidilokratna, Hodgson, Cowley, Jitrapakdee, Boonsaeng, Panyim & Walker 2002; Gonza \u0141 lez, Gomez-Puertas, Cavanagh, Gorbalenya & Enjuanes 2003; Gorbalenya, Enjuanes, Ziebuhr & Snijder 2006; Pasternak, Spaan & Snijder 2006) . The insertion of YHV into Nidovirales was supported by similarities in both its genomic organization and its replication mechanism (de Vries, Horzinek, Rottier & de Groot 1997; Pasternak et al. 2006; Sittidilokratna, Dangtip, Cowley & Walker 2008) . In Nidovirales, includingYHV, the key biochemical machinery for virus replication is typically encoded by a large discontinuous open reading frame (ORF), referred to as ORF1a and ORF1b, which overlap in a small area containing a \u00c0 1 ribosomal frameshift (Cowley et al. 2000; Sittidilokratna et al. 2002; Gorbalenya et al. 2006) . Other genomic regions include ORF2, which encodes the nucleocapsid and envelope proteins (Cowley, Dimmock & Walker 2002; Jitrapakdee, Unajak, Sittidilokratna, Hodgson, Cowley, Walker, Panyim & Boonsaeng 2003; Cowley, Cadogan, Spann, Sittidilokratna & Walker 2004; Gorbalenya et al. 2006; Sittidilokratna, Phetchampai, Boonsaeng & Walker 2006) ; ORF3, which encodes the precursors for the envelope glycoproteins GP116 and GP64 Jitrapakdee et al. 2003) ; and ORF4, which is interrupted by multiple stop codons (Nadala Jr,Tapay & Loh 1997; Sittidilokratna et al. 2008) .",

Although P. monodon is the most a\u00a1ected shrimp, other penaeids have also been reported to be susceptible to di\u00a1erent grades of virulence. For example, when a mixed culture of P. monodon, Pterocarpus indicus and Penaeus merguensis was a\u00a1ected by YHV, signi\u00a2cant mortalities were observed only in P. monodon, and this phenomenon was explained as a host speci\u00a2city (Mohan, Shankar, Kulkarni & Sudha 1998 ). In addition, YHV has been found in non-cultivable shrimp (P. merguiensis, Acetes sp., P. styliferus and P. ensis) without typical disease symptoms (Durand et al. 2000) . This apparent host speci\u00a2city and wide distribution in natural non-cultivable shrimp populations is indicative of the immense natural reservoirs and their role in YHV dissemination. An apparently non-virulent strain of YHV,YHV-Lv, was recovered from healthy L. vannamei cultivated in Mexican farms, where YHV-associated epizooties have not been reported (de la Rosa-Velez et al. 2006) , leading to questions about the di\u00a1erent virulence of YHV-Lv and otherYHV strains. Also, the Asian strain, YHV-Pm, was recovered from P. monodon during a YHVepizooty in Thailand, in 1996, and it has been experimentally reproduced in L. setiferus.",

The genomic regions (3CL PRO , POL, HEL, GP64, GP116, N, PEP1, ORF1a/1b and M1) to be sequenced were selected based on the importance of these genes in viral metabolism, the availability of similar sequences and/or similarity to related viruses (Cowley et al. 2000 Jitrapakdee et al. 2003; Ziebuhr, Bayer, Cowley & Gorbalenya 2003; Sittidilokratna et al. 2006 ). In addition, primers published by Sittidilokratna et al. (2002) were used for ampli\u00a2cation and sequencing of the region containing the slippage and involving an RNA pseudo knot located immediately downstream of this slippery sequence. The optimal annealing temperature was determined by temperature gradient, for each primer pair. Most annealed between 56 and 58 1C, while temperatures of 42 and 66 1C were used for ORF4 and GP116 respectively (Table 1) . After PCR, the corresponding fragments were sequenced as many times as necessary to obtain complete and error-free sequences.

To determine viral gene expression through an experimental infection, the viral doses for inoculation were established as the maximal viral dilution able to induce all disease symptoms, but still showing 100% survival of animals up to 96 h. This assay was performed by inoculation of 90 apparently healthy animals with di\u00a1erent viral dilutions (10 animals per dilution) and the time for maintaining 100% of living animals was recorded. As expected, with high doses (up to dilution 1:10), mortality was observed in the \u00a2rst 36 h; however, when dilutions 1:20 and 1:30 were used, the \u00a2rst death of an animal was recorded at 84 and 108 h respectively. By non-linear regression analysis, the 1:24 dilution was determined to be the highest viral concentration where100% survival could be observed at 96 h after inoculation (Fig. 2) , and then this dilution was used in all subsequent experiments. Next, the best tissue for sampling was determined by inoculation of 10 animals with 20 mL of adequate viral dilutions, and the ampli\u00a2cation of the PEP1gene was performed in haemocytes, the haepatopancreas, muscle, gill, gut and pleopods obtained at 24 and 96 h postinoculation. Polymerase chain reaction products were separated on acrylamide gels and silver stained, which is a fast, inexpensive and sensitive method (Fig. 3a) . Ampli\u00a2cation was not observed in the haepatopancreas and gut (Fig. 3b) , while a moderate signal was obtained in the muscle and gill. However, intense ampli\u00a2cation of the PEP1 gene was observed in pleopods from 36 to 96 h (Fig. 3c ) and haemocytes at 24 and 96 h (Fig. 3d) . Although haemocytes and pleopods showed the most intense signal, the isolation of total RNA from haemocytes requires a careful manipulation of the sample to avoid degranulation or cellular lysis. Thus, pleopods were selected as the sampling tissue for monitoring the expression of 3CL PRO , POL, GP116 and GP64 as a measurement of the replicative capability of the YHV-Lv.",

As in all Nidovirales studied, the structural glycoproteins, GP116 and GP64, are involved in the interaction with host cells (Gonza \u0141 lez et al. 2003; Jitrapakdee et al. 2003; Gorbalenya et al. 2006) , and speci-\u00a2cally, GP116 has been associated with the pathogenic behaviour of several YHV strains (Sittidilokratna et al. 2008 ).

The gene expression pro\u00a2le is compatible with the viral replication model, initially proposed by Ellis and Delbruck (1939) . The \u00a2rst phase, associated with virus adsorption and/or penetration, and the third phase, related to virus assembly and release, characteristically show low gene expression, while the second phase is di\u00a1erentiated by a fast increment in gene expression probably due to virus replication.",

Although comparable expression pro\u00a2les could be established, quantitative di\u00a1erences were detected (Fig. 4 ) among individuals and, consequently, high dispersion was obtained. For example, at 96 h postinfection, the number of copies of GP64 ranged from 10 5 to 10 8 , although discrete dispersion was observed for GP116 (10 5^1 0 6 ) and 3CL PRO (10 7^1 0 8 ). Then the curve slope from 24 to 72 h, representing the expression rate, was calculated for each gene and each shrimp. Equimolecular concentrations of 3CL PRO and POL coding sequences are expected because they are transcribed together as the replicase polyprotein 1ab, which is encoded by two large overlapping ORFs (ORF1a/1b) that contain the \u00c0 1 ribosomal frame shift. After transcription, 3CL PRO and POL functional proteins are produced by site-speci\u00a2c cleavage of the replicase polyprotein 1ab.",

Afterwards both transcripts displayed similar increasing rates, but maintained the 3CL PRO /POL ratio around 10 3 . Likewise, GP116 and GP64 are encoded by ORF3, but di\u00a1erent concentrations of their corresponding transcripts were detected, mainly between 24 and 48 h, when the concentration of the GP64 transcript rapidly increased (Fig. 4) . These disparities could not be explained due to the poorly understood replication and transcription mechanisms in Nidovirales where sub-genomic mRNA and double-stranded RNA intermediates, as well as the poorly described non-structural proteins seem to be implicated (Pasternak et al. 2006; Enjuanes, Sola, Zun \u00ec iga & Moreno 2007) . The importance of 3CL PRO for Nidovirales replication has been corroborated by the silencing of this gene in YHV-infected P. monodon, which caused a strong inhibition of viral replication, whereas silencing GP116 and GP64 was less e\u2044cient (Ziebuhr et al. 2003; Tirasophon, Roshorm & Panyim 2005; Yodmuang,Tirasophon, Roshorm, Chinnirunvong & Panyim 2006; Tirasophon, Yodmuang, Chinnirunvong, Plongthongkum & Panyim 2007) . As shown in Fig. 4 , 3CL PRO is highly expressed early, perhaps because this protein is required for creating other functional viral proteins by proteolytic cleavage (Ziebuhr et al. 2000) . On the other hand, transcripts of the structural glycoproteins GP116 and GP64 also showed di\u00a1erent concentrations. This could be due to di\u00a1erences in the hydrolytic action of RNases where polyA tails have a degradation-protective role (de Vries et al. 1997; Pasternak et al. 2006) .",

In this way, two shrimp (Org 3 and Org 5) showed a lower viral expression rate (Fig. 5 ) and this could be associated with individual resistance to virus attachment. Expression of viral genes is associated with viral replication and disease severity; hence, organisms with high viral replication should be more susceptible than those with lower rates of virus replication. Considering that viral replication is complete 24^72 h after inoculation, the slope in this time frame is representative of the gene expression rate and could be used as a measurement of viral susceptibility. Although further experiments are required, viral replication analysis could be used to establish shrimp infection status and expression levels associated with disease.",
