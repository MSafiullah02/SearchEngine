All DNA and RNA polymerases share a similar structure, and RdRps are more similar to each other than to other polymerases. There are several crystal structures of RdRps available including those from poliovirus (PV);1 Hepatitis C virus;2 Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV);3 bacteriophage \u03c664; Foot and Mouth Disease Virus;5 Bovine Viral Diarrhea Disease Virus;6 Rhinovirus;7 and Reovirus.8 All adopt the typical polymerase structure of a right hand complete with fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains. Cocrystallization with nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) or with oligonucleotides of these enzymes has mapped substrate binding sites, while the binding of divalent cations, Mg2+ or Mn2+, has been mapped to the catalytic sites.3, 5, 6, 8 The active site is at the heart of the molecule, in the centre of the palm domain, and an additional domain, N\u2010terminal to the fingers that anchors the tips of the fingers to the thumb is present in RdRps.3, 6, 8 Beyond several conserved motifs there is little primary sequence conservation among the RdRps of the RNA viruses in general, or among those of the double\u2010stranded (ds) RNA viruses. The catalytic site is normally characterized by a GDD motif, also known as motif C.9, 10, 11, 12 In addition to the GDD motif, several other less obvious sequence motifs (A, B, and D\u2013F) have been identified from diverse virus families on the basis of primary and secondary structure analysis.9, 10, 11, 12\n",

VP1 is the largest BTV protein at 150 kDa, and is encoded by BTV RNA segment 1. BTV VP1 has been shown to be a processive viral RdRp, synthesizing dsRNA from a single stranded (ss) RNA template in the absence of other viral proteins,16, 17 but there is currently no X\u2010ray crystal structure data available for it. The RdRps of bacteriophage \u03c66 (P2) and Reovirus (\u03bb3), for which detailed structural data are available, are potentially the most similar to VP1 as both viruses have segmented double stranded (ds) RNA genomes. The P2 protein of \u03c66 is small at 664 amino acids in comparison with the 1302 amino acids of VP1. P2 acts both as a replicase and a transcriptase and is able to use both ssRNA and dsRNA as templates.4, 18, 19 In contrast, there is currently no experimental evidence that VP1 is able to transcribe RNA from a double\u2010stranded template in the absence of other viral proteins. It may be that the transcriptase activity of VP1 is dependent on the presence of another BTV protein, VP6, which is a helicase protein and has the ability to unwind the dsRNA prior to transcription.20 Reovirus \u03bb3, which has a total of 1267 amino acids, is a similar size to BTV VP1. \u03bb3 has a centrally placed polymerase domain (PD) and large N\u2010terminal domain (NTD) and C\u2010terminal domain (CTD) which form a cage around the PD holding it rigid and preventing movement during the catalytic cycle.8 The NTD covers one side of the active site, and anchors the fingertips to the thumb. It occupies a similar position to the NTDs found in other RdRps but is considerably larger. A cap recognition site has been located on the NTD of \u03bb3 which anchors the 5\u2032 end of the dsRNA template during RNA replication.8 The CTD of \u03bb3 forms a bracelet structure with two tightly sealed circles. The opening in the centre of the bracelet forms the exit route for the nascent double stranded RNA.8\n",

Initially the BTV\u201010 VP1 sequence was submitted to the web\u2010based server SAM T\u201002 in blocks of 500 amino acid residues. Submission of the central 500 amino acid residues of VP1 produced alignments with the RdRps of two positive sense ssRNA viruses, RHDV and PV. Subsequently PSIPRED21 was used to predict the secondary structure of VP1, and then this prediction was compared to the secondary structure assignments obtained from the X\u2010ray crystal structures of the RHDV and PV RdRps. Further alignment of motifs A\u2010F and secondary structure was performed manually. The final polymerase sequence alignments (Figures 1A and 1B) were submitted together to the program MODELLER,23 to generate a spatially restrained three\u2010dimensional model of the PD of VP1 (Figure 2A). The model has a typical polymerase structure and has the canonical structure of a right hand with \u201cfingers\u201d (blue), \u201cpalm\u201d (red), and \u201cthumb\u201d (green). The \u201cfingers\u201d subdomain has three \u03b1 helices (\u03b1\u2010a,d,e; supplementary information) and four \u03b2 strands (\u03b2\u20101,2,4,5 supplementary information). Generally most RdRps have eight \u03b1 helices and five or more \u03b2 strands, one of which is contributed by the NTD.1, 3, 5, 6, 7 The modeled PD of VP1 might therefore be missing some alpha helical structure. Also, there is a region between the NTD model and the PD model (residues 374\u2013580), which currently remains unmodeled as sequence homology in this region is too low for reliable alignment with known protein structures. Although it is possible that VP1 may have an area of unique structure adjacent to the \u201cfingers\u201d subdomain, it would be surprising if it was not possible to model the complete \u201cfingers\u201d subdomain as this structure is well conserved between polymerases. Another possibility is that the unmodeled region belongs to the NTD.",

This is an arrangement universally found in polymerases. The architecture of the \u201cpalm\u201d region is the most highly conserved structure of all known polymerases and many of its features are shared across all families of RNA and DNA polymerases.12 It contains some of the conserved sequence motifs common to all RdRps and which are involved in nucleotide binding, phosphoryl transfer, structural integrity of the \u201cpalm\u201d subdomain, and priming nucleotide binding.5 Figure 2C (i) depicts a portion of the modeled PD of VP1 showing the region containing conserved sequence motifs A\u2013D, all of which show strong structural similarity to the solved structures of other RdRps (Figure 2C, ii, iii, iv). The sequence motifs make up the highly conserved structure of the \u201cpalm\u201d subdomain. The aspartate residues in motif C which are predicted to be responsible for divalent cation coordination are at positions 764 and 765 (Figure 2B).

The other two VP1 fragments did not produce any radiolabeled band at the correct positions in the gel indicating that these two VP1 fragments did not have NTP binding sites.

PCR was carried out using a standard reaction mixture. The amplified DNA fragments were digested with BamHI (Fermentas) and ligated into plasmid pET15b (Novagen). Clones with the VP1 fragment in the correct orientation were identified by restriction digest. The resulting expression vectors pET15b NTD, pET15b PD, pET15b CTD and pET15b PD+ were amplified in E.coli strain DH5\u03b1 and verified by sequencing before being introduced into expression strain HMS175 (DE3).
