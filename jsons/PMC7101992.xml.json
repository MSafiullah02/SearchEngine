Brain tissue oxygen (PbtO2) monitors, placed directly into brain parenchyma, permit continuous bedside PbtO2 assessment and for quantification of hypoxic events in the brain. When used with an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor PbtO2 monitors have enhanced the ability to detect secondary neuronal injury after severe brain injury. Observational clinical studies demonstrate a consistent association between reduced PbtO2 and poor outcome [1\u20133]. In addition clinical studies suggest that PbtO2 goal-directed therapy may be associated with improved outcomes among patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) [4\u20136].",

There are many factors that may influence compromised PbtO2 but one possible mechanism is altered pulmonary function [7, 8]. Obesity affects control of the respiratory cycle, impairs respiratory muscle function, hampers gas exchange, and increases the risk of aspiration [21]. Airways resistance, metabolic demands, and work of breathing also are increased in obese patients; this may induce rapid shallow breathing, which exacerbates ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch [22, 23]. The intrapleural pressure at the lung base can exceed atmospheric pressure in the airway, causing bronchioles at the lung base to collapse [15, 24]. This further contributes to ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch [14, 25].",

We had hypothesized that obesity would affect ICP by altered intracranial compliance and/or decreased venous return, and so compromise PbtO2. Consistent with this hypothesis, induced abdominal compartment syndrome is associated with an increase in central venous pressure, internal jugular pressure, and thoracic transmural pressure that together contribute to increased ICP. Future studies measuring cerebral blood flow, cerebrovascular resistance, and autoregulation may shed light on the effect of obesity on intracranial compliance.",

However, the data were collected prospectively and our patients were treated according to a standard practice guideline that may limit potential bias. Second, the study was performed on patients with several different forms of acute brain injury. This may obscure the effects of obesity in different types of brain injury. For example, risk factors for DCI, such as arterial vasospasm, were not accounted for in our analysis. However, we lacked sufficient power to analyze the effect of DCI in the subset of brain-injured patients with SAH. Third, our sample size was limited since not every patient admitted to our ICU had both measured height and weight assessments. This may introduce a selection bias although demographic characteristics did not differ between the study cohort and excluded patients. Recorded estimates of height and weight were available for some patients; however, we chose not to use this data since it is known that estimates by health care providers often are inaccurate. This issue is common to many studies in this field where inadequate documentation of height and weight measurements compromises sample size [39\u201341]. Fourth, we defined obesity using BMI. While this is a valid method to define obesity, percent body fat (% BF) or abdominal girth may be more sensitive markers of patient risk than BMI [42]. Finally, the study is not a pure observational study since patients received therapeutic interventions to correct a reduced PbtO2 or an increased ICP. It is possible that interventions themselves may have obscured the effect obesity had on PbtO2.",
