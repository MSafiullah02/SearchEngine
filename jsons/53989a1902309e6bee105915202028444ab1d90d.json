The pandemic has led to many social and health-care challenges. In this context, surgery is an area that is facing the need for many adaptations. In this systematic literature review, we analyzed different perspectives concerning this situation, aiming to provide recommendations that could guide surgeons and entities toward screening, elective and emergency surgeries, decision making, and operating room management. A computerized search in PubMed, Scopus, and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) for relevant literature up to April 4, 2020, was performed. Articles were included if they were related to surgery dynamics in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 281 articles found in our initial search and 15 articles from alternative sources, 39 were included in our review after a systematic evaluation. Concerning preoperative testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, 29 (74.4%) articles recommended some kind of screening. Another major suggestion was postponing all (or at least selected) elective operations (29 articles, 74.4%). Several additional recommendations with respect to surgical practice or surgical staff were also assessed and discussed, such as performing laparoscopic surgeries and avoiding the use of electrocauterization. On the basis of the current literature, we concluded that any surgery that can be delayed should be postponed. COVID-19 screening is strongly recommended for all surgical cases. Moreover, surgical staff should be reduced to the essential members and provided with institutional psychological support.",

These cases were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Further analysis through unbiased sequencing and isolation of airway epithelial cells revealed a previously unknown betacoronavirus, named 2019-nCOV (2019 novel coronavirus), which became the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans (2) . Early reports suggested the onset of a potential coronavirus outbreak because of the high reproduction number. By the end of January 2020, 7,734 cases were confirmed in China, with 90 others being reported in other countries including Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Japan, Republic of Korea, United States, India, Australia, Canada, France, and Germany. At this time, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On April 4, 2020, the most recent date covered by this review, the WHO reported 1,051,697 confirmed cases and 56,986 deaths in 207 countries affected by the epidemic (3), after coronavirus disease (COVID-19, named by the WHO on February 11, 2020) was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (4) .",

Its replication rate (R0) of 2.0-3.0, death rate of approximately 5%, and the absence of immunological memory in humans, together with the time of adaptation for disease screening and notification, led to a rapid growth in the numbers of infected individuals worldwide (4, 5) . This phenomenon brought the attention to the greatest challenge posed by this disease: the high demand for health-care services versus the capability of health-care systems (5) . The rapid growth in the numbers of infected individuals has drastically increased the demand for health services, which has led to social and health-care adaptations, ranging from social distancing to the reformulation of health-care delivery (6) .",

We also conclude that all surgical patients should be screened for COVID-19, with preference given to PCR tests. Regarding surgical practice recommendations, we believe that surgical staff should be reduced to the minimum, without compromising the procedure and any operation should be performed by the most experienced surgeon, so that the procedure time is reduced. An institutional workflow to assist medical staff in decision making and in dealing with mental health issues should also be established.",
