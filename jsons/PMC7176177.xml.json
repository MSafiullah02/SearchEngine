            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important respiratory pathogen among infants and toddlers, with infections prevalent and nearly universal in this age group. Severe infections are more common among premature infants, those with cardiac and pulmonary anomalies, and the immunosupressed. Effective prophylactic monoclonal antibody treatment is available for high-risk infants, but there is no effective vaccine. Mouse challenge models have been used for the study of the human RSV pathogen, but the most severe forms of RSV disease are not replicated by this approach. Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM; family Paramyxoviridae, genus Pneumovirus) is a mouse pathogen of the same family as human respiratory syncytial virus. PVM replicates efficiently in mouse-lung epithelial cells in vivo in response to a minimal virus inoculum, and replication is accompanied by local production of proinflammatory cytokines (MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-2, MCP-1, and IFN-\u03b3) and granulocyte recruitment to the lung. PVM infection and the ensuing inflammatory response can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory compromise. Our laboratories have pioneered the use of the PVM model for the study of human clinical disease, which has provided important insights into the role of the inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory virus infection. As part of this work, we have presented several immunomodulatory strategies that clearly reduce morbidity and mortality when administered to PVM infected, symptomatic mice, and thus hold promise as realistic therapeutic strategies for severe RSV infection in human subjects.",

            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a near universal affliction of infancy and childhood, accounting for approximately 50% of all pneumonia and up to 90% of the reported cases of bronchiolitis in infancy. Of those infected during the first year of life, one-third develops lower respiratory tract disease, and 2.5% are hospitalized (more than 90,000 children in the United States every year). In many previously healthy infants, RSV disease is a mild and self-limited infection involving the upper and lower respiratory tract, with varying degrees of peribronchiolar and interstitial inflammation. In others, the disease progresses to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia, including submucosal edema and bronchiolar obstruction requiring oxygen, and in the worst cases, mechanical ventilation. Infants at particularly high risk for severe disease include those born prematurely, infants and children with cardiac or pulmonary anomalies, and the immunocompromised. Prophylactic monoclonal antibody therapy is available for high-risk infants, but no vaccine is yet approved for use. RSV has also recently been recognized as an important pathogen in the institutionalized elderly. The clinical features and pathology of RSV disease have been reviewed extensively, and the reader is referred to these excellent sources of additional information [1\u20134].",

This is particularly true when considering infectious pathogens, many of which have particular tropisms or specificities for a limited range of hosts, and in some cases present with completely different clinical illnesses in different species. While it would perhaps be ideal to study all human pathogens in natural, relevant human or higher primate hosts, this approach is of course completely limited and impractical. Despite clear and recognized differences between human and rodent immune and inflammatory responses, various factors (availability of characterized strains, ease of handling and breeding, availability of sophisticated experimental tools). together have provided a focus on inbred strains of mice as a centerpiece for human disease research. As such, it is critical that one understands what the unique features of each infectious disease model are and that the specific advantages and the individual limitations in each situation are clearly understood.",

Interestingly, PVM was isolated from lung tissue from the control (thought to be uninfected) mice, which yielded an infectious isolate after undergoing serial mouse-to-mouse passage. Choppin and colleagues [10] presented the first electron micrographs of these newly discovered virions (Fig. 35.1), which they described as defining a new, third subgroup of myxoviruses. The polymorphic virions formed spheres of 80\u2013120 millimicrons in diameter to filaments up to three microns in length, and replicated over a period of 24\u201330 hours in mouse lung tissue in vivo, with virus amplification proceeding at \u223c16-fold per cycle. Perhaps most interestingly, Ginsberg and Horsfall [11] recognized the potential of PVM for the exploration of acute respiratory virus infection in an evolutionarily relevant host. Among several studies, these authors were the first to relate the development of lung lesions to ongoing virus replication and to evaluate altered morbidity and mortality in response to rudimentary immumodulatory therapy, specifically in response to administration of bacterial capsular polysaccharide [11\u201313].\n",

The original studies by Horsfall and colleagues [9,11\u201313] were performed on an isolate known as strain 15, which was at that time highly pathogenic in mice. Since that time, PVM strain 15 has reportedly undergone tissue-culture passage and lost some of its pathogenicity in vivo, although the extent to which this is so, and in which specific isolates, remains uncertain. A second strain, PVM strain J3666, also developed at the Rockefeller University, has been reportedly maintained in mice with minimal tissue-culture passage, and has recently been shown to be highly pathogenic in nearly all inbred strains of mice [19]. In our hands, PVM strain 15 from Dr. Andrew Easton\u2019s laboratory (PVM strain 15 Warwick) is highly attenuated and elicits a minimal inflammatory response in the highly susceptible BALB/c strain of mice [20]. In contrast, PVM strain 15 from the American Type Culture collection (PVM strain 15 ATCC) is pathogenic in BALB/c mice (unpublished findings), but results in little to no disease in the less susceptible C57BL/6 strain at similar inoculating doses [<100 pfu/mouse [21]]. Krempl and colleagues [22] likewise found PVM strain 15 (ATCC) to be highly pathogenic in the BALB/c strain. Complete sequence data are available for both PVM strain J3666 and PVM strain 15 [23,24]. The most remarkable differences are in selected regions of the G (attachment protein) and throughout the sequence of the SH small hydrophobic glycoprotein.",

Specifically, MIP-1\u03b1 gene-deleted mice are readily infected with PVM, although 105-fold fewer granulocytes are recruited to the lung tissue in response to the identical initial inoculum. Similar results were obtained upon infecting mice devoid of CCR1, the major receptor for MIP-1\u03b1 on neutrophils and eosinophils. We have used this observation to design specific immunomodulatory strategies for the virus-induced inflammatory response and its associated pathology [31,32] (discussed further below). Interestingly, although MIP-1\u03b1 is clearly crucial for granulocyte recruitment in response to PVM infection, this chemokine, acting alone, even at high concentrations, does not induce ARDS, nor does it recruit granulocytes effectively in the absence of IFN-\u03b3 [33].",

In a study performed using young adult (eight\u201312 weeks) through aged (up to 78 weeks), but otherwise immunologically na\u00efve mice, we observed no change in the kinetics of PVM replication, but diminished local production of several proinflammatory mediators, including MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, and IFN-\u03b3, along with diminished recruitment of granulocytes to the lung tissue [35]. The differences observed when comparing these results to those reported among elderly human subjects, who tend to have more severe, rather than less severe forms of RSV infection, may be related to virus re-exposure and its impact on the ensuing biochemical and cellular inflammatory responses. Interestingly, there is no published data on PVM replication and disease pathogenesis in neonatal mice, a critical target population given the prevalence of pneumovirus infection among human infants and toddlers.",

Of particular recent interest are the ways in which IFNs and IFN-mediated signaling mechanisms interact with proinflammatory pathways and modulate the production of chemoattractant cytokines. As part of a larger exploration of the inflammatory responses to PVM, we examined the differential expression of cytokine genes in wild-type mice and mice devoid of the receptor for type I interferons (IFN\u03b1\u03b2R gene-deleted mice) [36]. As anticipated, PVM infection induces transcription of IFN antiviral response genes preferentially in lung tissue of wild-type over IFN\u03b1\u03b2R gene-deleted mice. However, we demonstrate that PVM infection also results in enhanced expression of eotaxin-2, TARC, and the proinflammatory RNase mouse eosinophil-associated RNase (mEar) 11, and we observe paradoxically prolonged survival among the IFN\u03b1\u03b2R gene-deleted mice.",

Neutralizing antibodies were detected at 14 days after inoculation in mice receiving live attenuated virus (but not heat-inactivated virus), which correlated with protection against subsequent challenge with the highly pathogenic strain J3666 [21]. Among the interesting questions, we are not certain of the duration of protective immunity. Interestingly, the responses of IFN\u03b3R gene-deleted mice were indistinguishable from the wild-type mice, indicating that any role for IFN-\u03b3 in generating acquired immunity in this setting is at least somewhat dispensable (Fig. 35.5). Among our other findings, PVM antigens, when prepared and administered in a manner analogous to the earlier hRSV lot 100 vaccine [37], will induce a Th2-mediated hypersensitivity response [38].\n",

The PVM model replicates this scenario, as ribavirin at concentrations of >10 \u00b5g/ml is effective at blocking virus replication in tissue culture, and at concentrations of 75 \u00b5g/kg/day, at blocking virus replication in mouse lung tissue in vivo. Yet, analogous to observations made in clinical studies, administration of effective doses of ribavirin alone to PVM-infected, symptomatic mice, has little impact on the ultimate outcome of disease, when measured in terms of morbidity and mortality [31,32]. In conjunction with this observation, we found that, although ribavirin was quite effective at blocking virus replication, it had no impact on the ongoing production of proinflammatory chemokines and associated recruitment of granulocytes to the lung tissue. Clearly, there is some disconnect between virus replication and the ensuing inflammatory response, in that inflammation is not necessarily controlled effectively at all given points in time by reducing or eliminating the primary stimulus.",

We have determined that hydrocortisone therapy has no effect on the production of MIP-1\u03b1 or on the influx of neutrophils; PVM-infected mice responded to hydrocortisone with enhanced viral replication and slightly accelerated mortality [41]. These results suggest several mechanisms to explain why glucocorticoid therapy may be of limited benefit in the overall picture of pneumovirus infection.
