HBoV types 1-4 were determined to be members of the Bocaparvovirus genus in the Parvoviridae family, with sequence similarity to both bovine parvovirus and canine minute virus [4]. Despite HBoV1\u2019s frequent detection in respiratory samples from subjects with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), its role as a respiratory pathogen is not fully understood. High rates of co-infection (up to 70-80% in some studies) with predominantly Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Rhinovirus, Parainfluenza, Adenovirus [5,6] and also frequent detection in asymptomatic subjects [7], have promoted a hypothesis of HBoV1 as a \u201cpassenger\u201d virus [5,7,8]. In vitro culture models of the virus have been described [9,10] which could further elucidate pathogenicity.",

            "text": "Clinically, HBoV1 infections are typically characterized by mild self-limiting acute respiratory symptoms including cough, rhinitis, acute otitis media, and pharyngitis [7,11]. However, possibly due to the unknown pathogenicity and frequently asymptomatic or self-limiting nature of bocavirus infections, HBoV is often omitted from diagnostic investigation. Nevertheless, evidence to support HBoV1 as the aetiological agent in presentations of ARTI is growing, for instance by use of serological diagnosis using acute convalescent sera [12] and through correlation of HBoV1 viral loads with symptom severity in mono-infections [5,11,13]. Furthermore, the virus has been associated with respiratory symptoms in the absence of other viral, fungal, or bacterial agents, with a significant detection rate difference between cases and controls [5]. HBoV1 has been associated not only with self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections, but also lower respiratory tract symptoms including wheezing, bronchiolitis, respiratory distress, and pneumonia [5,8]. Indeed, there are several documented cases of bocavirus infection associated with severe lower respiratory illness requiring hospitalization, oxygen therapy, and even intensive care [[14], [15], [16], [17]]. Taken together, these findings suggest HBoV1 can function in isolation as a respiratory pathogen.",

Samples were collected from January 2015 to April 2017 from individuals between 6 months and 5 years of age that were known to be negative for a panel of more established respiratory viruses. Having identified a significant number of bocavirus mono-infections associated with clinically severe disease, HBoV1 was included as a target in routine respiratory viral panel screening. HBoV1 detection was also reported throughout a calendar year (September 2018 to August 2019) in upper and lower respiratory tract samples, again identifying significant numbers of patients infected with HBoV1, mainly children but also adults, encompassing both mono- and co-infections. Overall, our findings support the hypothesis that HBoV1 can be a significant human pathogen responsible for clinically relevant respiratory disease.",
