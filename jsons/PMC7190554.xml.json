Three phenomenological models are presented in [13], which were validated with outbreaks of other diseases different from COVID-19, trying to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of reported cases. Other works (see e.g. [14]), propose SEIR type models with little variations and some of them incorporate stochastic components. COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new virus, which is generating a worldwide emergency situation and needs a model taking into account its known specific characteristics. In particular, it would be convenient to develop a model which incorporates the following:\u2022the effect of undetected infected people (see [15]), being able to show the dependence of the impact of COVID-19 on the percentage of detected cases over the real total infected cases. Here, we denote by \u03b8 the fraction of detected cases over the real total infected cases. We note that there exist in the literature various works that propose estimations of \u03b8 in several countries (including China) for the COVID-19 pandemic (see, e.g.,\n[15\n,\n16]\n).\n\u2022the effect of different sanitary and infectiousness conditions of hospitalized people (differentiating those with mild and severe conditions that will recover from those who will finally die),\u2022the estimation of the needs of beds in hospitals (which is one of the major problems for policy makers addressing COVID-19).\n",

That model was initially used for the 2014-2016 ebola outbreak (see [17]) and has also been used for the 2018-2020 ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (see [18], [19]), in both cases with very successful forecasts. Other works of our group related with the mathematical modeling of epidemics can be seen on the website https://www.ucm.es/momat/epidemics. In this paper, we have adapted that model to the specific case of COVID-19. Only within-country disease spread is considered in this paper for territories with a relevant number of people infected by COVID-19, where local transmission is the major cause of the disease spread. We point out that, when available, the parameters of the model are taken from the literature (see, e.g. [15], [20]). Undocumented parameters or specific parameters to our approach are identified by using a multi-objective optimization approach, developed in a previous work (see [19]). We point out that we use a novel approach that relates the disease fatality rate with the percentage of detected cases over the real total infected cases, which allows to study the importance of this percentage on the impact of COVID-19.",

To do that, it uses two procedures at each iteration: reproduction and replacement. Firstly, the reproduction method applies some classical genetic operators (here: selection, mutation, and crossover) to the population of the previous iteration to obtain a new offspring population. Secondly, the replacement procedure decides which solutions from the previous iteration and the offspring populations should compose the population for the next iteration. The main feature of WASF-GA is that this decision is based on preferences, which are defined as reference values for the objectives. Indeed, it classifies the individuals using an achievement scalarizing function (see [39]) characterized by the L\u221e distance between the objective function values and the reference values with different weights. The considered sample of weight vectors is built following [39] to ensure they are well distributed. As a result, WASF-GA returns a set of solutions covering a region of the Pareto optimal front.\n",

Focusing on the number of new daily people in the exposed compartment E, we observe that the peak was reached on 27 January 2020, suggesting that the isolation measures taken in China on 23 January 2020 were efficient to quickly reduce the magnitude of the epidemic. The peak for the new daily cases and deaths (which is the visible part for the society) is delayed due to the transition rates between each compartment of the disease. Therefore, despite the effects of the control measures are immediate, this effect is visible for the society after a non negligible delay (in this case around two weeks).",
