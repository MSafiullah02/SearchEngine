It is an epithelial malignant tumor of endometrium, which has a high mortality rate and seriously threatens the health of women [4, 5]. It can be divided into two types: estrogen dependent and non estrogen dependent [6]. The incidence of non estrogen dependent tumors is low, but the malignancy is high and the prognosis is poor [4, 7]. The prognoses of endometrial cancer patients with metastasis are poor regardless of grade or stage, and the overall survival rate of patients is significantly reduced [8]. There is evidence that microsatellite unstable endometrial cancer has infiltration of granzyme B + cells, activated cytoxic T-lymphocytes, and PD-L1 + cells [9], which suggests that endometrial cancer can be treated with immunotherapy to improve prognosis.",

Moreover, the immune cell response is closely connected with the clinical prognosis of KIRP, and tumor related macrophages can represent the indicator of good prognosis of KIRP [14, 15].

Surprisingly, the promoter methylation levels of ACE2 in UCEC and KIRP were significantly reduced (Figure 5A, 5F). ACE2 may be activated and up-regulated due to its hypomethylation, which to some extent explained the elevated ACE2 in UCEC and KIRP. SARS-CoV-2 can use ACE2 as a receptor to enter cells, and it has high homology with SARS-CoV [24]. Therefore, we used the GSE30589 and GSE52920 databases to study the changes of ACE2 of Vero E6 cells and mouse that were infected with SARS-CoV. The results showed that ACE2 expression levels in both of them were reduced after SARS-CoV infection (Figure 6). This finding suggested that tumor tissues may also have decreased ACE2 levels after SARS-CoV-2 infection in UCEC and KIRP.",

            "text": "As an important member of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 has shown different roles in some pathological processes. One study showed that overexpression of ACE2 can protect endothelial cells by inhibiting the inflammatory response, which is beneficial to early prevention of atherosclerosis [36]. Walters et al. [37] found a direct relationship between atrial structural remodeling and plasma ACE2 activity in patients with atrial fibrillation. While ACE2 not only affects the progress of cardiovascular diseases, but also plays a new role in tumor pathology. Yu C et al. [20] found that down-regulating the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis caused breast cancer metastasis by activating store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and PAK1/NF-\u03baB/Snail1 pathways. ACE2 also down-regulates VEGFa expression in breast cancer cells and inactivates phosphorylation of VEGFR2, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in human umbilical endothelial cells, furthermore, ACE2 can prevent breast cancer cell metastasis in zebrafish models [38]. A study carried out by Yu X et al. [39] showed that ACE2 can block the inflammatory response of pancreatic acinar cells by blocking the p38 MAPK/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Li J et al. [40] examined the role of ACE2 and FZD1 in squamous cell/adenosquamous carcinoma (SC / ASC) of the gallbladder, the results showed that negative ACE2 expression in SC/ASC was associated with high TNM stage and lymph node metastasis, and survival analysis showed ACE2 and SC/ASC overall survival were positively correlated. ACE2 was also decreased in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but overexpression of ACE2 in vitro exerted protective effects by inhibiting cell growth and VEGFa production [41]. In addition, ACE2 overexpression in non-small cell lung cancer can inhibit tumor angiogenesis induced by acquired platinum resistance [42]. In general, ACE2 mainly affected tumor metastasis by intervening signaling pathways, but the mechanism by which ACE2 affected the prognosis of UCEC and KIRP is unclear. Here, we found that ACE2 may affect the prognosis of UCEC and KIRP through a new mechanism, that was, immune infiltration, which can provide a direction for future in-depth research. But this research also has some limitations, due to the limitation of the database, we did not continue to analyze the deep relationship between ACE2 and immune infiltration. Also, experiments are urgently needed to verify the analysis results in our research.",
