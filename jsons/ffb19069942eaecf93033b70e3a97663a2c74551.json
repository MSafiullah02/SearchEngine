            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is a frequent cause of paediatric morbidity and mortality and a common reason for both outpatient visits and hospitalizations. Among humans, RNA viruses are the most frequent agent to cause the common cold; usually resulting from a self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection (URTI; [Heikkinen and J\u00e4 rvinen, 2003] ). Viruses are also frequently associated with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) among children [Klig and Shah, 2005] which may necessitate assisted ventilation. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are among the most common traditionally diagnosed viruses while human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and recent members of the genus Coronavirus are now understood to contribute significantly to acute respiratory tract infections [Hayden, 2004; Fouchier et al., 2005; van der Hoek et al., 2005] . Because of increasing reports of an association between HRVs and lower respiratory tract infections, these viruses should be common diagnostic targets yet they, along with the classical human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are frequently absent from diagnostic research studies. Similarly, studies describing newly identified viruses (NIVs) belonging to the family Coronaviridae indicate that there is considerably greater potential to cause illness within the genus than once thought [Heikkinen and J\u00e4 rvinen, 2003; van der Hoek et al., 2004] .",

Furthermore, epidemiological studies addressing the role of these and other viruses in acute respiratory infection using PCR often sacrifice sensitivity and specificity by combining the rapid molecular technique with laborious and subjective culture and serological assays.

A variety of putative HRV lineages were circulating during the study period but most of these clustered within the HRV type A (HRV-A) classification (92.5% of all HRV; n \u00bc 37; Fig. 1 ). HRV were detected during summer (23.7% of HRV detections; n \u00bc 33), autumn (29.5%; n \u00bc 41), winter (17.3%; n \u00bc 24) and spring (29.5%; n \u00bc 41).

Eighteen strains identified as HRV by the RT-PCR assay were sequenced from the summer secondary study population; nine were HRV-A1 and nine were HEV-like.

Typically, HAdV type C has been associated with less severe respiratory illnesses while HAdV type E has been linked to viral pneumonia [Horwitz, 2001; Heim et al., 2003] . The type C HAdVs were sequenced most commonly in this study, present alongside other viruses in three patients with suspected bronchiolitis. One patient with suspected pneumonia was positive for HAdV type E in the absence of any other microbe. HAdV type C was also the predominant lineage not detected by the original PCR method, demonstrating the clinical inadequacy of that assay.",

Our screening did not detect HCoV-HKU1, Mimivirus, Mossman virus, HPIV-4, IFCV nor human Parvovirus B19. The existence of HCoV-HKU1 in Brisbane was described previously among specimens collected during the winter of 2004 at a rate of 3.1% [Sloots et al., 2006] . Its absence in the present study population may reflect that HCoV-HKU1 has an outbreak pattern of incidence missed by our specimen sampling, as has been reported for HCoV-OC43 [Vabret et al., 2003] . Similarly, the low rate of IFAV and IFBV can be explained by a paucity of specimens from some months of the winter season, particularly August, a peak period of influenza virus activity. A study of more specimens would address this issue. Overall, DNA viruses were more frequently codetected with another microbe than were RNA viruses.",

We considered the inclusion of an endogenous internal control important to monitor the PCR components of testing. In contrast, other recent studies have used an exogenous RNA target [Druce et al., 2005] or a DNA target for RT-PCR assays [Syrmis et al., 2004] . A supplemented control does not test template integrity although it does monitor the extraction process, while a DNA template cannot monitor the most inefficient step of the RT-PCR process, namely reverse transcription [Kolls et al., 1993] . Both endogenous internal control and viral target failed to amplify in four of tested specimens but in three other specimens for which the internal control failed, viral sequences were still detected. The latter result suggests that human DNA may sometimes be absent in NPA specimens.",

While some of these viruses do not appear to be the sole agent of suspected acute respiratory tract infection in our population, future studies are needed to better define their roles and further refine the composition of diagnostic panels for the benefit of routine diagnostic laboratories. Whilst the implication of an expanded laboratory test panel is increased cost this is not the case on a per test basis [Hyypi\u00e4 et al., 1998 ]. Furthermore, any additional expenditure should be measured against increased laboratory diagnoses which can better direct expensive patient therapies, reduce overall hospital stay and its associated costs, and minimize the spread of nosocomial infection. The number of specimens lacking a laboratory diagnosis (33.0%; n \u00bc 104) fell within the range reported by other epidemiological studies which describe 12% to 66.2% of negative specimens [Jartti et al., 2004; Syrmis et al., 2004] .",

Additionally, the PCR methods employed in this study permitted the detection of many viruses whose routine isolation by culture was impossible without expending considerable time and effort and for which no molecular testing was currently employed on our campus. The recent discoveries of HMPV, HCoV-NL63, HBoV HCoV-HKU1, and an increasing body of literature implicating HRV in lower respiratory tract infection make it clear that the importance of any respiratory virus should not be underestimated. It is essential to keep an open mind about the potential for newly identified viruses to cause illness and about the possible requirement to redefine associations between characterized viruses and respiratory illnesses as molecular diagnostic techniques improve our understanding of the dynamic nature of respiratory tract infections.",

The nucleotide distance matrix was generated using the Kimura 2-parameter estimation. Nodal confidence values indicate the results of boot strap resampling (n \u00bc 1,000).
