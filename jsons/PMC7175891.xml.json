Survival is the most critical goal for different pathogens and parasites, especially concerning their chances of reproduction. Past research has shown that behavioral host manipulation can occur to promote the best interest of the pathogen [1], [2]. Host manipulation can be viewed as adaptations that commandeer the behavior and actions of the host in ways that promote the reproductive best interests of the virus. Benefits may result in increased chances of transmission and survival. Host manipulation has been recognized in a number of pathogens such as toxoplasmosis, rabies, and influenza [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. It is important to mention that certain pathogens are neuro-invasive, and understanding how it targets and manipulates the central nervous system (CNS) can broaden possible questions about host manipulation [7], [8].",

The current incubation period for SARS-CoV2 has been estimated at 5 days, but has been observed with a range between 0-24 days. It might be the case that incubation period is facultatively responsive to the possibility of transmission rate and R0. In other words, with a high possibility of transmission, incubation to infection may be delayed in order to maximize number of hosts.\n",

            "text": "An alternative means by which a virus could increase sociality is to reduce the negative emotional consequences of social exclusion. Several studies have documented that social exclusion produces the feeling of \u201cpain\u201d, discomfort, and loss of self-esteem in humans [11]. This effect is magnified by the possibility of kin relationships[12]. The neural underpinnings of this social pain/neural alarm system appear to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). If a virus could manipulate the response of the ACC to social exclusion (i.e. social distancing) people would feel less upset and might thus seek additional social support or simply gather socially (e.g., parties). In other words, if your primary friend group excludes you, you might find yourself seeking new people to \u201chang out\u201d with instead of simply wallowing in your own discontent.Hypothesis 2There is some evidence that P.A.N.D.A.S. (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection) produces increased separation anxiety in young children, along with obsessive compulsive behaviors [13]. These separation anxieties could promote infection of older hosts. Children have been reported to be fearful of being away from their primary caregivers - expressed as separation anxiety about being isolated from them for extended periods of time. If children become asymptomatic carriers of this virus, then they could function as strong vectors for transmission.\n",

            "text": "Hu et al. recently investigated 71 cases involved with pneumonia developing from the novel SARS-CoV2 virus [14]. It was found that many patients had low levels of serum cholesterol compared to 80 healthy controls. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-Cholesterol were found to be significantly lower. Looking deeper into low cholesterol levels, Huang et al. found that lower serum cholesterol levels might correlate with depressive and anxious patients [15].Hypothesis 3There is mounting evidence in support of the idea that children born to mothers infected with various pathogens are at heightened risk of later complications, both physical and psychiatric. Most notably, children born to mothers that have been infected with the seasonal influenza virus show an increase in the incidence of schizophrenia and affective disorders [16], [17], [18]. The best estimates are that children born to mothers infected with influenza have a 4 times greater risk of developing either schizophrenia or an affective disorder, with schizophrenia being more likely. This line of research is still preliminary and controversial. We will not be able to observe the effects of SARS-CoV2 on unborn children for some time, but the possibility that this virus manipulates fetuses for its own reproductive success is not out of the question. For example, fetal exposure could produce an early immunological response that results in a suppression of symptoms, but not the elimination of infection nor behavioral changes that could later promote reemergence. Thus, these individuals could be very powerful vectors for transmission in the future. This is of course conjecture, but not outside the realm of possibility.\nHypothesis 4Perhaps the biggest threat associated with this or any virus, is mutation that 1) becomes even more easily transmissible to others and 2) becomes rapidly lethal after the incubation period. Signs of the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 mutating are already being observed [19]. There appears to be a larger divergence between the novel SARS-CoV2 virus and other known coronavirus\u2019. Researchers also found that the virus has branched into at least two types, type L and type S, in which the S is portrayed as the ancestral version of the SARS-CoV-2. Type L is known to be more prevalent and more aggressive, which could lead to a quicker spread throughout the populations.\n",
