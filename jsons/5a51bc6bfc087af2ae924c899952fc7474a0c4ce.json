All individuals preferentially interact with those who have tested positive, such that seropositive individuals act as immunological 'shields.'

In the United States, 600,000 cases and 25,000 deaths were reported by that date [1] . Unprecedented 'social' or 'physical' distancing measures have been put in place to reduce transmission and thereby blunt the epidemic peak (i.e. \"flatten the curve\"). Beginning early in March, U.S. states began to close schools, suspend public gatherings, and encourage employees to work from home if possible. On March 17, 2020, the US federal government issued national social distancing guidelines, leading to wider implementation of such policies throughout the country. At present, 95% of the U.S. [2] and over 30% of the global population is under some form of lockdown or government-issued shelter-in-place order [3] . However, the U.S. federal guidelines are set to expire on April 30, 2020, which may result in some activities resuming and facilities re-opening in a matter of weeks [4] .",

Germany, for example, has plans to test millions of people and to provide 'immunity passports' to those who test positive [8] . Moreover, it has been proposed that immune individuals could be returned to society in a more efficient way by having them act as 'shields' [9] .

These tests and likely others that become available will be imperfect [12, 13] . For the purpose of informing social distancing, specificity (rather than sensitivity) is of primary concern. An imperfect test will inevitably lead to false positive results, which in this context leads to individuals being incorrectly classified 2 as immune. If used as a basis to relax social distancing measures, this error could lead to an increase in transmission. The probability that a person with a positive test truly has immunity (the positive predictive value) will change over the course of the epidemic as true prevalence increases.",

(Figure 1) We assume that after a latent period, infected individuals progress to either undocumented or documented infection. A fraction of symptomatic cases are severe enough to seek care and become documented infections. A proportion of those with documented infection are hospitalized, with a subset of those requiring critical care. Surviving cases, both undocumented or documented, recover and are assumed to be immune to reinfection (Table 1) . All individuals who have not tested positive and are not currently experiencing symptoms of respiratory illness are eligible to be tested. All hospitalized cases are tested prior to discharge. Recovered individuals are moved to the test positive group at a rate that is a function of the test sensitivity. Susceptible, latently infected, and undocumented cases may falsely test positive and are moved to the test positive group at a rate that is a function of test specificity. False positives may become infected, but the inaccuracy of their test result is not recognized unless they develop symptoms that are sufficiently severe to warrant hospitalization and health providers correctly diagnose COVID-19, overriding the history of a positive antibody test. The ordinary differential equations corresponding to this model are included in the supplemental material. All models were run using R in the package 'deSolve' in R version 3.6.2.

Some states and municipalities issued their own guidance before this date, others after. To account for variations in timing, we assumed that national social distancing began on March 25th. Although adherence to these measures varies geographically and is generally difficult to measure, we made several assumptions about how these policies have changed location-specific contacts. First, we assume that under these measures, all contacts at school and daycare 3 were eliminated and that contacts at non-home, non-work, non-school ('other') locations were reduced by 75%. We assume that contacts at home remain unchanged. To address differences in work-based contacts by occupation type, we classified the working adult population into three subgroups based on occupation: those with occupations that enable them to work exclusively from home during social distancing, those continuing to work but reduced their contacts at work by 90% (e.g., customer-facing occupations such as retail), and those continuing to work with no change in their contact patterns (e.g., frontline healthcare workers). The percent reduction in other contacts, percent contact reductions for essential workers who can reduce their contacts, and the timing of the start of national social distancing were calibrated by fitting to incidence observed in the US under social distancing such that the estimated number of deaths was within an order of magnitude to that reported on April 16, 2020 . This corresponds to a 64.7% reduction in overall contacts for working-age adults, which is consistent with initial data from reductions in face to face contacts, which ranged from 50-85% [19] .",

We consider a phased approach to re-opening that begins to relax social distancing restrictions on May 1, 2020 and that these changes begin to affect contact patterns one week later on May 9, 2020. At this time, we assume that schools and daycares remain closed but that social distancing measures for the general population can be relaxed, by allowing work and other contacts to be increased. To represent this, we scale 'work' and 'other' contacts to a proportion of their value under general social distancing based on a scalar constant, c, such that c = 1 is equivalent to the scenario in which social distancing measures as put into place on March 17 are maintained and c = 0 is equivalent to a return to pre-pandemic contact levels for both 'work' and 'other' contacts for essential workers and pre-pandemic contact levels for ''other contacts for all other groups. We assume that all children return to school and daycare on September 1,2020.",

Individuals that test positive can return to work (if they are not already working) and can increase their non-home and non-school contacts to normal levels. To represent the deployment of immune persons in customer-facing and other high-contact occupations, we assume that contacts at work and other (non-home, non-school) locations are preferentially with immune persons by specifying that the probability of interacting with a test positive person is 5 times what would be expected given the frequency of test-positives in the population (\u03b1=4), modeled using 'fixed shielding' as described previously in [9] .

Social distancing has the potential to greatly reduce this burden, with indefinite social distancing reducing cumulative deaths by 83% and leading to a flattened epidemic curve.

We estimate that current social distancing policies have reduced total contacts for adults by 65%, which is supported by recent estimates [19] . If social distancing measures are relaxed such that adults only reduce their contacts by 41% compared with pre-pandemic levels (c=0.5) and schools are reopened in the fall, 688,000 deaths would be expected by January 15, 2021 ( Figure 2 ). However, if yearly serological testing of the US population (1 million tests/day) is also implemented in tandem with nationwide relaxation of social distancing, expected deaths fall to 561,000, saving 127,000 lives. If monthly testing is achievable (10 million test/day), expected deaths fall to 514,000, saving an additional 47,000 lives. In the same scenario with monthly testing, 67% of the US population would test positive by the end of one year and be able to both return to work and increase other social contacts to pre-pandemic levels ( Figure 3 , 24% if yearly testing is used). The magnitude of this benefit depends on the degree of immunological shielding-if \u03b1 = 0 (no shielding), 726,000 deaths would be expected, more than if testing were not implemented at all.",

Testing 200,000 people per day is roughly equivalent to a 10% increase in social distancing intensity (Figure 4 ). At higher levels of testing, these effects are more complex: one million tests per day reduces mortality equivalent to 50% increase in social distancing intensity for scenarios with weak social distancing, but can have perverse effects with very strong social distancing, if infection prevalence remains low and thus the rate of false positives is higher (Figure 3 ). While a test with 100% specificity would eliminate the potential for false positives, the impact of this change on cumulative deaths would be minimal.

School reopening in early fall is unlikely to trigger a second wave of infections unless the US remains under nationwide lockdown until the start of the academic year (c = 1). A secondary peak is more likely to occur during the summer, after social distancing measures are initially relaxed. If the US elects to maintain social distancing at its current level until early fall, small increases in transmission may occur after schools reopen.

Our models suggest that serological testing can make an important contribution to these efforts. Maintaining a moderate level of social distancing (i.e., at half the current level) together with an aggressive serological testing program (at least yearly testing) could release 24 to 67% of the population from social distancing within the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals who test positive could act as 'shields' to reduce transmission, leading to greater reductions in overall deaths [9] . Although our model with moderate relaxation of social distancing plus monthly serological testing still results in 514,000 deaths, it also results in a flattened curve that provides time to improve treatment and expand healthcare capacity, which could ultimately reduce mortality rates [22] . Moreover, our models suggest that an approach with serological testing results in up to 174,000 fewer deaths than a strategy without testing, with promise of greater benefit if testing is targeted towards higher-risk groups [9] . In addition to fewer deaths, serological testing would also allow a substantial fraction of the population to return to work and other activities with relative safety, compared to a universal rollback of social distancing policies that would erase hard-earned gains we have made to date in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (see SI).

Germany has already implemented serological testing on a large scale, including repeat testing of the same individuals on a regular (i.e. monthly) basis [23] . Although this would require a significant and rapid scale-up in testing capacity, significant scale-up has already been achieved for diagnostic PCR testing: from fewer than 1,000 tests per day in early March to nearly 150,000 tests per day in early April. Drawing whole blood samples requires trained healthcare personnel, which would likely be prohibitive in terms of cost and time on a mass scale. However, self-administered dried blood spot tests, which require only a finger prick, may address some of the logistical challenges of a mass serological testing program if assays can be optimized and validated for use on dried blood spots. Even if testing can be scaled up, requiring evidence of a positive test to return to work creates strong incentives for people to either misrepresent their immune status or intentionally get infected. A successful mass testing program must consider how a program would enforce existing social disparities and guard against potential inequities in the availability of testing. Moreover, a history of a positive antibody test should not change the clinical care of individuals with respiratory symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection if a PCR diagnostic test would otherwise be indicated.",

Thus, deploying immune individuals so they are responsible for more interactions than susceptible individuals will always tend to decrease risk. If shielding is not used, this benefit disappears and testing can become a liability, which may explain why our findings differ from others [25] . In our model, cumulative deaths are not substantially impacted by the false positive rate given that deaths are similar when specificity is 100%. Although false positives are more important than false negatives for disease transmission risk, suboptimal sensitivity also has implications for a mass testing strategy. The first FDA-authorized serological test has 94% sensitivity, which may reduce cost-effectiveness of testing by missing truly immune individuals. Complementing serology with PCR-based viral diagnostic testing could substantially increase the pool of immune people able to return to work and other activities. Strategies that use both tests should be the subject of future modeling studies.",

First, we assume that antibodies are immediately detectable after resolution of infection. In reality, this likely occurs between 11 to 14 days post infection [26] , similar to SARS-CoV-1 [27] . In practice, a small fraction of recent infections would be missed by serology, which would have a minor effect on our results. Second, we assume that immunity lasts for at least a year. Given that the virus has only been circulating for a matter of months in the human population, both the duration of antibody protection and the extent to which those antibodies protect against future infections is unknowable. Antibody kinetics of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS suggest that protection will last for at least months and as long as several years [27] . Ongoing studies of SARS-CoV-2 show that antibodies persist for at least 7 weeks, with more data to become available over the coming months [26] . Third, we assume that antibodies detected by serology are a correlate of protection. However, for some coronaviruses, antibodies do not appear to protect against subsequent infections [27] . To explore how this might impact our results, we conducted a sensitivity analysis where specificity was set to 50%, which assumes no discrimination between true and false positives. In this scenario, higher testing rates led to increased deaths due to increasing interactions with seropositive individuals with low levels of immunity (see SI). This increase in deaths was not apparent until testing rates reached 100,000/day, the same level at which a more specific test would be expected to begin to provide population level benefits.",

Several estimates of case fatality have been reported (including [28] ), but these numbers have varied significantly by setting. As case fatality is often uncertain in the early stages of an epidemic, the value of R 0 is better estimated using generation time data. Using this method, estimates of R 0 have ranged between 2 and 3 [29] . We derived the expression for R 0 based on our model and varied R 0 within the credible range defined by previous studies. While we did not formally fit to incidence data, we tuned Die ad , Die el , and R 0 to be consistent, within an order of magnitude, with reported death rates in early March 2020, before national social distancing began. We then calculated the resulting q value (see S4 for derivations of the basic reproduction number).",

Higher testing rates tend to lead to lower immunity in the test positive population because a greater number of false positives are released from social distancing, and when shielding is strong these test positives mix to a greater extent with the test-negative/untested population, contributing to ongoing transmission. The level of immunity in the test positive population is shown in Fig-ureS2 below for 5:1 shielding.
