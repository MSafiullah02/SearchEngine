The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic affected about 30 countries and resulted in 8422 cases and 916 deaths globally between November 1, 2002, and August 7, 2003 [1]. According to the data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), from April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010, approximately 60.8 million H1N1 cases and 12,469 deaths occurred in the United States [2]. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) also causes severe respiratory illness with a high case-fatality rate in humans [3]. As of July 21, 2017, it had attacked 27 countries and induced 2040 cases, including at least 712 deaths [4]. Viral or bacterial respiratory infections are the cause of more than 10% of the 6 million global annual deaths [5]. Hong Kong has a high population density and has been badly affected by SARS [6], H1N1 [7], and H7N9 [8]. For example, from November 1, 2002, to August 7, 2003, approximately 20.8% of the global SARS cases and 32.8% of the SARS deaths occurred in Hong Kong [9]. Therefore, a study of airborne infectious disease transmission at the city level in Hong Kong can provide information that the local government needs to plan for, and deal with, emergencies.",

Simulation of infectious disease transmission based on mathematical models such as SIR [10], SEIS [11], SIRS [12], SEIR [13], and complex networks [14] is generally very fast, but these models do not reflect micro-patterns such as personal contact, which are essential for studying the effects of intervention at the personal and building levels. Models based on human behavior use simulated human activity at hourly intervals to calculate infection probabilities [15], [16], but are significantly limited by computational power. Most studies of human behavior and infectious disease transmission have focused on a single space, such as a hospital [17], a cruise ship [18], or an office [19]. The total population considered in these studies is usually no more than 50,000; when the total population in a study is several million, it is very computationally complex to simulate all human behavior that occurs in many different indoor environments. For a large city such as Hong Kong, the computer storage requirement alone can be formidably large if detailed behaviors are to be simulated [20]. However, if we combine these two types of models, most of their disadvantages can be solved and simulations can be accurately conducted within an acceptable amount of time.",

Models that could simulate human behavior in detail for every room and building and consider many environmental factors would help governments to make more effective intervention plans. This study builds such a model using smallpox as a typical airborne infectious disease. We constructed a human behavior integrated hierarchical (HiHi) model to simulate airborne infectious disease transmission in Hong Kong, which has more than 7 million people, 2.5 million homes, 700,000 offices, 30,000 classrooms, 30,000 restaurants, 54 hospitals, and 2566 public transportation routes. For indoor environments, the simulation accounts for human behaviors and considers transmission patterns in a typical home, office, school, restaurant, hospital, and on public transportation. To reduce computer storage requirements, we determined mathematical patterns for indoor infectious disease transmission in each different type of indoor environment. Airborne infectious disease transmission at a city level was then simulated by combining mathematical equations for locations at a more granular scale (building and room) with daily human behavior.",

In this study, the infection probability is defined as the probability of a person being infected in 1 h. In Fig. 2, using buildings as an example, P2, which is the infection probability in the building, is calculated from four primary indices: infection probability at the lower scale (room) (P\u2032), personal attributes (P\nR), indoor environment variable (E\nR), and human behavior in a room (B\nR). Personal attributes include resistance (age and gender); indoor environment variables include total population and population density in a building, ventilation, hygiene, temperature, humidity, and building size (number of floors, offices/classes, public rooms including conference rooms and toilets); and human behavior includes the frequency of visits to public rooms, visits to other offices/classes, wearing of a mask, and hand washing. Based on these secondary indices, we can simulate airborne infectious disease transmission in a particular indoor environment, and an infection probability can be obtained. For example, there are millions of buildings in Hong Kong. Each building has fewer than hundreds of rooms, and each room has fewer than hundreds of people. Based on this method, the calculation time can be drastically reduced if the simulation can be hierarchically classified.",

Fig. 6\nshows the effects of different personal decisions on infectious disease transmission. The green line shows the results of the hospital group, and the purple line shows the results when all of the infected people stay home. (We assumed that infected people make a random decision during the infectious period.) The number of infected people is much lower in the scenario where most of the infected people decide to go to hospital. In the case of all infected people staying home (purple line), the infection spreads very quickly because many people have already spread the disease before they decide to stay home. In other words, the efficiency of transmission prevention is low if infected patients stay home, and no other measures such as work stoppages and school closures are taken during the early stage of the outbreak. The red line (case 6) shows the results when 90% of the infected patients stay home and the other 10% take no measures. The percentage of infected people increases to 57% of the population after 115 days if there are no other controls. Comparing the black and purple lines, we can see that staying home is more helpful in controlling disease transmission than taking no measures.

When Vent increases to 5, the smallpox will be generally controlled without any additional measures, and the cumulative infected population is less than 3000 after 1 year. However, a high ventilation rate signifies a serious waste of energy, especially in Hong Kong. Therefore, balancing ventilation and energy consumption is very important.

We also found that the number of infected people increases slowly during the first several weeks and then sharply increases between days 60 and 150. This means that it is very important to control the transmission of smallpox during the early stages of the outbreak.",

            "text": "Here we compare our results to those of previous studies. About 43% of the population would be infected during the peak period of a smallpox outbreak in Hong Kong [20]. Our simulation also shows that at its peak, three out of every seven people would be infected. Focusing on the infection risks of different places, we determined that the number of people infected during their daily routines (at work or school) is twice the number of those infected at home [45]. This value is 1.4 because we assumed that people stay at home instead of going outside. Based on smallpox data collected in London from 1950 to 1965, the peak number of infected people occurs about 20\u201322 weeks after the beginning of an outbreak [46]. Due to the higher population density in Hong Kong, this peak will occur at about 19.75 weeks, which is when the most people will become infected by smallpox on 1 day. A smallpox outbreak will be naturally controlled after 150\u2013200 days if no steps are taken to control it. If 50% of the population is vaccinated, the infection risk decreases to 29% [47]. We found that under a no-control scenario, a smallpox outbreak tends to stabilize after day 200. In the case of 50% vaccination, the infection risk becomes 27% if no other control measures are taken. Research has also indicated that the increasing trend agrees with Eq. (9) (R0 is the basic reproduction number; T\nG is the generation time). Smallpox is less infectious (R0 = 4\u201310) and has a much longer incubation period (T\nG \u2248 21) [48].(9)Ninf=exp((R0\u22121)tTG)\n",

The effects of very high air exchange rates due to window opening are not considered as a high ventilation rate is known to minimize the airborne spread of diseases and most windows in commercial buildings are not operable in Hong Kong. Moreover, we have ignored exposure in transient spaces such as elevators due to relatively short exposure period.

Offices and school buildings rank second and third for infection risk, due to their higher population densities, complex people movement, and poorer ventilation. Work stoppages and school closures are shown to be effective at protecting residents from airborne infectious diseases. If both work stoppage and school closure measures are taken when the number of infected people is greater than 1,000, an infectious disease can be effectively controlled after 2 months. Having infected people stay at home also reduces the number of infected patients, but the efficiency of this approach is low if no other measures are taken. If 90% of infected people go to hospital during the infectious period, the peak number of infected people decreases by 25% compared with the do-nothing scenario, and the peak infection period is delayed by about 40 days. In an ideal situation, the spread of smallpox would be halted within a short period if infected people went to hospital during the symptomatic period rather than during the infectious period. If ventilation could be increased to five times the default setting, the smallpox outbreak would be gradually controlled. The HiHi model used in this paper greatly reduces the time needed to calculate the spread of infection.",
