The clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection varies from asymptomatic or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death. Common clinical symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but it might not always be present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit. MERS-CoV has a reported case fatality rate of approximately 35%. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in the elderly, immunosuppressed and those with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes (2) (3) (4) (5) .",

The vector was constructed in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to facilitate genetic manipulation of genomic clones with improved stability and flexibility. Cellular immunogenicity of recombinant E1 E3-deleted ChAdOx1 was comparable to that of other species E derived chimpanzee adenovirus vectors including ChAd63, the first simian adenovirus vector to enter clinical trials in humans. The E1 region is essential for viral replication, hence the ability to delete E1 renders the new vector immediately replication incompetent. The deletion of the non-essential adenovirus E3 region increases the insert capacity of the new vector by approximately 5kb. It is known that the proteins encoded by the E4 region of adenoviruses interact with E1 during viral replication, and the imperfect interaction between the gene products of the AdHu5 E1 gene produced by HEK293 cells and simian E4 gene products has been found to result in impaired viral replication in this cell line, and consequently lower virus yields. In ChAdOx1, Ad5 E4Orf4 has been inserted to replace the homologous simian virus coding sequence, resulting in improved viral replication during vaccine production. Since no replication of the virus takes place after immunization, this replacement has no effect on immunogenicity of the viral vector. Insertion of recombinant antigens at the E1 locus is performed using Gateway\u00ae site specific recombination technology (Invitrogen).",

Serum neutralising titres were measured 28 days after vaccination, when the mice were then challenged with MERS CoV by intranasal inoculation.
