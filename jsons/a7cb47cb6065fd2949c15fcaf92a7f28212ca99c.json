We included children aged 2-16 years with active asthma, defined as three or more recurrent episodes of reversible wheezing. The severity of asthma and of asthmatic exacerbations was recorded. Immunofluorescence assays (IFA) on nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS), serological tests, or both, were used for detection of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays on NPS were used for rhinovirus and enterovirus. Serological tests for Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were performed. A control group of asymptomatic asthmatic outpatients was examined for respiratory viruses (using IFA and PCR). Eighty-two symptomatic children (mean age, 7.9 years) were examined. Viruses were detected in 38% (enterovirus, 15.8%; rhinovirus, 12%; RSV, 7.3%). Serological tests for atypical bacteria were positive in 10% of patients (C. pneumoniae, 5%; M. pneumoniae, 5%). Among the 27 control subjects (mean age, 7.9 years), one PCR was positive for enterovirus. There was no correlation between severity of chronic asthma or asthmatic exacerbations and the diagnosis of infection. Atypical bacterial pathogen infections were linked with prolonged asthmatic symptoms. In conclusion, we confirmed the high incidence of viral infection in acute exacerbations of asthma, especially enteroviruses or rhinoviruses.

It is estimated that 10% of children in France will, at some time, have signs and symptoms compatible with asthma. 1 Numerous studies suggest that the prevalence of asthma has been increasing for 20 years. 1, 2 Our understanding of the pathogenesis of asthma has improved, resulting in a new concept of asthma as a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. Control of the inflammatory component has become one of the most important therapeutic targets of long-term treatment. 3 Despite improvements in treatment, asthmatic crises still occur, resulting in costly visits and hospitalizations. 2 The link between respiratory tract infections and acute exacerbation of asthma has been recognized for a long time. [4] [5] [6] Through advances in microbiological diagnosis, recent studies have highlighted the role of upper respiratory tract viruses as probably the commonest cause of exacerbations of asthma. 7 Other research also suggests that atypical bacteria, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, may play a role in asthma. 6, 8 The purpose of this regional prospective study was to investigate the role of these organisms in acute exacerbations of asthma in children.

Asthmatic patients often report a history of colds and upper respiratory symptoms in the days preceding the onset of an exacerbation. An association between respiratory infections and asthma attacks has also been suspected, and is supported by epidemiological data. Using conventional techniques (IFA, virus isolation, and serological methods), viruses were detected in about 30% of patients with asthmatic exacerbations. 5 By combining conventional and molecular techniques, Johnston et al. identified an infectious organism in 81.8% of patients with exacerbated asthma in a community study of 9-11-yearold asthmatic children. 7 The same authors reported that seasonal patterns in the prevalence of upper respiratory viruses correlated closely with hospital admissions for asthma in the area from which the cohort was drawn. 12 Finally, they confirmed a high frequency of viral infection, with positive findings in 68% of infants and children admitted to hospital for severe wheezing illnesses. 13 In a similar study over 4 years, Freymuth et al. identified infectious organisms in 77% of children aged between 3 months and 14 years and hospitalized for wheezing. 14 In our study, only 38% of children had a proven viral infection. The population's characteristics, and our diagnostic methods, may explain this low frequency. We only included children with a previous diagnosis of asthma, or with a history of three or more episodes of wheezing, and we excluded children under 2 years of age, to avoid any confusion with bronchiolitis. In their study of hospitalized children, Johnston et al. included all children with wheezing, including those with bronchiolitis and pneumonia. 13 Freymuth et al. did not describe the criteria used to define asthma, and toddlers (and therefore cases of bronchiolitis) were included in their study. 14 A weakness in the diagnostic methods of our study was the absence of PCR detection of adenovirus, RSV, parainfluenza, and coronavirus, as used in previous studies. 7, 13, 14 Molecular techniques are more sensitive than IFA and viral isolation for the detection of these viruses, as previously reported. 15 Community studies, involving intensive monitoring of children and their parents, allow early sampling, which probably increases the rate of detection of viruses compared with hospital-based studies. 5 In fact, several days may elapse between rhinitis and cough and the onset of wheezing, and between the onset of wheezing and hospital admission. 5 In our study, the delay between the onset of exacerbation and viral investigations could explain, in part, our lower rate of viral detection using the same methods. Finally, the exclusion of September, due to a delay in obtaining Ethics Committee approval, could have contributed to this low rate. The viruses predominantly detected in our study were the Picornaviridae, which represented 28% of positive samples, of which 12.2% were rhinovirus and 15.8% enterovirus, in agreement with previous studies. 7, 14 The PCR method is 3-fold more sensitive than cell culture techniques. 15, 16 In the Southampton community study, rhinoviruses were detected in 50% of children. 7 In hospital-based studies, similar results were reported for children older than 2 years, with detection rates of 46% 14 and 50%. 13 Our lower detection rate might be explained by variations in viral ecology between areas, or by the different sensitivities of the assays used. The first hypothesis appears unlikely, because rhinoviruses are ubiquitous, and have been detected with the same prevalence in the United States, Finland, England, and France. 7, 14, 17, 18 To detect Picornaviridae, we used the same primers (OL26 and OL27) used in similar studies. 7,13,14 Rhinovirus was specifically identified by Freymuth et al. 14 and by us with a specific primer. In the community study, 7 rhinovirus was identified in 29.8% of patients, but in 21.2% of patients, picornaviruses were classified as rhinovirus without confirmation with a specific primer. Therefore, these viruses may correspond to rhinovirus or enterovirus. Indeed, enterovirus is frequently detected, occurring in 15.8% of patients in our study. Freymuth et al. identified enterovirus in 9.8% of patients, 14 and Johnston et al. identified it in 10% of patients in their hospital-based study. 13 Enterovirus was not specifically identified in the community study. 7 To detect RSV, we coupled IFA on nasopharyngeal secretions and serological tests, as in the Southampton studies. 7, 13 In our study, RSV was detected in 7.3% of patients, and only during November and December, confirming an epidemic variation for this virus. RSV infections were found principally in the youngest children, and the RSV detection rate increased to 15% in children less than 7 years old. RSV was identified in 18% of children older than 2 years in the study of Freymuth et al. (using IFA and PCR), 14 in 12.5% of children in the hospital-based study of Johnston et al. (using IFA, culture, and serology), 13 and in only 4.1% in the community-based study of older children (IFA, culture, and serology). 3 Detection levels for other viruses were 3.6% for influenza, 2.4% for parainfluenza, and 1.2% for adenovirus. Our results for the influenza virus are similar to those of previous studies. 7, 13, 14 In our study, parainfluenza virus was always associated with another pathogen: enterovirus in one patient, and M. pneumoniae in the other. Adenovirus was identified in just one patient. However, Freymuth et al., using molecular techniques, detected adenovirus in just 1.5% of children older than 2 years. Adenoviral infections seem to play a minor role in the exacerbation of asthma. Finally, we did not detect coronavirus with IFA. Freymuth et al. identified this virus in 4.5% of patients using IFA, 14 and Johnston et al. identified it in 13% by culture and molecular amplification. 7 Viruses are not the only organisms incriminated in the acute exacerbation of asthma. Previous studies suggested that common bacterial infections do not play such a role. 5 However, atypical bacteria that can develop intracellularly, such as C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae, 19 may be associated with the exacerbation of asthma. 20, 21 Dallo and Baseman 19 demonstrated intracellular development of M. pneumoniae in human cells cultures, but this has not been reported in patients with respiratory disease. Future research may clarify whether or not this organism, generally recognized as a surface parasite, can also play an intracellular role. C. pneumoniae, an obligate intracellular organism, is a common respiratory pathogen associated with atypical pneumonia, bronchitis, rhinitis, or sinusitis in children and adolescents. 22 C. pneumoniae infection is associated with wheezing in both children and adults. 21 The diagnosis of C. pneumoniae infection remains difficult. The PCR technique is more sensitive than other techniques, but is susceptible to false-positive diagnoses in cases of asymptomatic carriers or environmental contamination. Serological tests have a poor sensitivity because of the difficulty in detecting specific IgM by immunofluorescence techniques and the delayed rise of antibodies. In fact, IgM appears after 3 weeks in C. pneumoniae infections, and IgG after 6-8 weeks. 23 The half-life of serological IgA is short (less than 1 week), and the presence of IgA may correspond to persistent antigenic stimulation and reflect chronic infection. 23, 24 Emre et al. identified C. pneumoniae in 11% of patients by culture and in 25% by serological testing in children with exacerbated asthma, and reported improvement in respiratory symptoms after treatment with macrolides. 25 Cunningham et al., 8 using PCR and specific secretory IgA in nasal aspirates, showed similar results in asthmatic children with or without exacerbations (23% and 28%, respectively). However, patients with repeatedly positive PCR and high local IgA presented with more frequent acute exacerbations, suggesting a link between asthma symptoms and chronic C. pneumoniae infection. 8 Four C. pneumoniae serological tests were positive in our study (5%), of which three might be suggestive of chronic infections, according to our definition.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 602, "end": 603, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 808, "end": 809, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1008, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1178, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1345, "end": 1347, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1861, "end": 1863, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2182, "end": 2184, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2185, "end": 2188, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2189, "end": 2191, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2321, "end": 2323, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2523, "end": 2524, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2670, "end": 2671, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3176, "end": 3178, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3179, "end": 3181, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3252, "end": 3255, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3256, "end": 3258, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3342, "end": 3343, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3462, "end": 3464, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3474, "end": 3476, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3797, "end": 3799, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 3800, "end": 3803, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3804, "end": 3807, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3808, "end": 3810, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3969, "end": 3971, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 4415, "end": 4417, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 4502, "end": 4504, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 4573, "end": 4574, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 4688, "end": 4690, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 4691, "end": 4693, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 5194, "end": 5196, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 5291, "end": 5292, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 5480, "end": 5482, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 5483, "end": 5486, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 5487, "end": 5489, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 5992, "end": 5994, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 6076, "end": 6077, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 6248, "end": 6249, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 6352, "end": 6354, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 6406, "end": 6409, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 6410, "end": 6412, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 6907, "end": 6909, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 6991, "end": 6993, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 7478, "end": 7480, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 7649, "end": 7652, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 7653, "end": 7655, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 7876, "end": 7878, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 7898, "end": 7899, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 8256, "end": 8257, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Asthma and Infection: Epidemiological and Microbiological Data"}, {"text": "M. pneumoniae is the primary causative agent of community-acquired pneumonia in children aged 2-15 years in industrialized countries, and is more common after 3 years of age. 20 Asymptomatic carriers are not infrequent, and represent 20% of positive PCR results in cases of familial epidemics. 26 As in previous studies, our detection rate was low in exacerbated asthma.

In our study, we examined a control population of 27 asthmatic outpatients with demographic characteristics similar to those of the hospitalized children. Only one PCR was positive for enterovirus in the control group. In this patient, subsequent examination revealed the presence of rhinitis at the time of sampling, with no symptoms of asthma. Therefore, our study provides further supportive evidence that acute infection is a significant cause of exacerbations of asthma. Viruses can induce asthmatic crises by two different pathways: directly, by infection of the lower airways; or indirectly, by an infection limited to the upper airways, which induces lower airway inflammation by immunological and neurogenic mechanisms, and consequently asthma symptoms. 27 Recent studies have shown positive signals for rhinovirus in bronchial biopsies 28 or bronchiolar lavage fluid, 29 strongly suggesting that rhinovirus replicates in the lower airways, as do parainfluenza and influenza viruses, adenovirus, and RSV. These results support the hypothesis of a direct effect on the lower respiratory tract. Although the precise mechanisms by which respiratory viruses cause symptoms are unknown, there is evidence to suggest that the immune response to the virus plays a major role in symptom pathogenesis. 27, [30] [31] [32] This response is complex and involves many airway cells, cytokines, and mediators, but few of these are likely to play key roles in this process.
