Signals in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region dominated the landscape of viral antibody response, with 40 independent loci and 14 independent classical alleles, 7 of which exhibited pleiotropic effects across viral families. We also link viral response genes with complex diseases, such as C4A expression in varicella zoster virus and schizophrenia. Lastly, based on 1028 subjects tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we identify 7 class II HLA susceptibility alleles (5 associated with other viruses). We also observe that genetic determinants of ACE2 expression may influence SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Our findings elucidate the genetic architecture of host response to viral infection, with potential implications for complex diseases and COVID-19. : medRxiv preprint SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be smokers (55.1% vs. 45.2%), had higher mean BMI (28.7 vs. 27.4 kg/m 2 ), higher levels of deprivation based on the Townsend index, and a higher burden of comorbidities based on the Charlson index (1 or more: 50.0% vs. 29.8%). Individuals with at least one positive test result (n=669) included a higher proportion of men (56.5%), former smokers (43.2% vs. 38.3%), and self-identified as non-white (15.5% vs. 8%).

We identified 40 independent SNPs/indels associated with EBV (EBNA, EA-D, VCA p18, and ZEBRA), VZV, and MCV antibody response that accounted for all significant HLA associations for other phenotypes. Of the 14 conditionally independent, genome-wide significant classical alleles identified for 10 antigens, 7 were associated with multiple phenotypes. The most commonly shared HLA alleles were DRB5*99:01, DRB1*04:04, an know rheumatoid arthritis risk allele 62 , and DQB1*02:01, which is implicated in susceptibility to celiac disease 63 . Furthermore, nodes anchored by HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 were at the center of the protein interaction network identified for TWAS genes that were implicated in antibody response to multiple antigens. Despite the predominance of association in HLA class II, one notable association in HLA class I was detected for A*29:02 and MCV seroreactivity, which is consistent with downregulation of MHC I as a potential mechanism through which Merkel cell tumors evade immune surveillance 64 .",

Formed immunocomplexes were quantified using a Luminex 200 flow cytometer, which produced Median Fluorescence Intensities (MFI) for each antigen.
