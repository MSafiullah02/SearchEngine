            "text": "Subtype distribution of influenza A (in the populations from children and adults over the winter 2009 influenza season are displayed in Figure 1 . The local epidemiology of respiratory viruses circulating in the community (both children and adults) for the 16 weeks preceding the outbreak is shown in Figure 2 . These data, obtained through weekly surveillance of respiratory viruses using molecular detection methods demonstrate that activity of non-S-OIV influenza A peaked from mid-February to mid-March and subsequently declined to a minimal level with no cases detected in the two weeks preceding the onset of detection of S-OIV. At the time of onset of the S-OIV outbreak (week 17 of 2009), parainfluenza was the major respiratory virus (of those tested) circulating in the community (maximum 11.1% weekly positivity rate) along with declining levels of influenza B and RSV at 2.4 % and 2.3 % respectively. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) and rhinoviruses (HRVs) were not tested during this out break. A small number of CHW samples were tested by PCR for adenovirus (# positive / # tested): 7/47 (14.9%) week 17, 7/39 (17.9%) week 18, 0/7 (0%) week 19, 1/18 (5.6%) week 20, 1/16 (6.3%) week 21 of 2009. It is probable that a significant percentage of the samples that tested negative for influenza A, B, RSV, HPIV 1, 2, 3, ADV, and S-OIV would test positive to HCoV or HRV. Influenza B accounted for all of the influenza strains detected in the 2 weeks preceding the outbreak. Enhanced surveillance conducted subsequent to the first positive case of S-OIV demonstrated a sharp spike in influenza A activity from no isolates to N=79 (8.3% positive of those tested) in Week 1, a small transient increase in influenza B activity (N=44; 4.6% positive), and co-circulation of parainfluenza viruses with detection rates of the latter (14.4%) exceeding that of S-OIV during the first week of the outbreak (week 17 of 2009) ( Figure  2 ). Influenza A activity continued to rise during the next 3 weeks of surveillance with detection rates in patients tested of 14.9%, 23.7% and 37.5% per week respectively (Duplicate clinical samples were removed before data analysis). Influenza B and RSV continued to be detected at low levels with weekly detection rates ranging from 0.2-1.7% and 0.6-1.3% for the two viruses respectively. Parainfluenza remained the most prevalent seasonal respiratory viral agent with detection rates of 8.9-12.6% in the last 3 weeks of study period. Seasonal human subtypes of influenza virus continued to be detected at low levels with daily patient positivity rates of 0%-2.5% during the first two weeks of the study period (weeks 17-18 of 2009), versus S-OIV daily positivity rates of 5.8%-58.2% in children and 0-3.7 % and 0%-40% respectively in adults. S-OIV percent positivity and total number of infections were significantly greater in children compared to adults during the first four weeks of the outbreak (weeks 17-20 of 2009) (Table 1, Figure 3 ). Of note, only 6 adults (2.4% of those tested) with S-OIV were identified in comparison to 68 (9.6 % of those tested) children in the first week of enhanced surveillance. The rate of positive tests for children and adults increased dramatically over the next 3 weeks (Figure 4 ). This most likely reflects the change in testing recommendations during the second week of May to test only seriously ill or high risk patients. Interestingly the number of patients between 5-18 that were tested each week remained fairly stable except for the first week (n=53,143,102, 179) . Week of specimen collection # of patients positive The number of cumulative cases in Wisconsin being independently reported by the CDC, the WI SLH and the MRVP during the first two weeks of the outbreak can be seen in Figure 5 . The number of cases identified at our laboratory exceeded the number reported by the WI SLH for the first 5 days of the epidemic. Rapid validation of our in-house subtyping assay by WI SLH enabled subsequent timely reporting of the number of cases by the WI SLH as early as the 6 th day of the epidemic. Cases reported by MRVP were validated to be \"probable\" S-OIV by WI SLH. MRVP cases were then included automatically in SLH totals. Arrow 2: Cases reported by MRVP were validated as \"confirmed\" by WI SLH using the CDC assay. MRVP and SLH cases were then included automatically in CDC totals. Arrow 3: testing is restricted to high risk patients. Note that the MRVP samples only come from southeastern Wisconsin, while the WI SLH cases include reporting from throughout the state.",

Subsequent rapid screening of patients with ILI symptoms, and subtyping of all influenza A positive samples was instrumental in identifying and assessing the evolution and extent of the outbreak in a timely manner. This provided information critically needed by both local and state public health officials for making decisions regarding utilization of diagnostic and therapeutic resources and public health interventions.",

Continued detection of seasonal human influenza during the S-OIV outbreak demonstrates the persistent presence of these viruses after their apparent \"disappearance\" from a community. The enhanced respiratory virus testing stimulated by the S-OIV epidemic led to increased identification of seasonal human influenza isolates in clinical samples. Utilization of multiplex assays for respiratory virus diagnostics, coupled with routine subtyping of influenza A positive samples, is important to identify respiratory disease due to an unusually long persistence of seasonal influenza or emergence of novel strains of the virus. Post -seasonal influenza outbreaks caused by clinically indistinct influenza strains could otherwise be obscured by seasonal surges from concurrently circulating parainfluenza or other respiratory viruses in the spring. Therefore, it is possible that novel strains of influenza have emerged previously and been unrecognized because they caused relatively mild disease and were not identified.",

Detection and evolution of an outbreak in real time is important for rapid implementation of community mitigation measures such as school closures, that have been suggested to be important for reducing transmission and subsequent morbidity and mortality in an outbreak [6, 7] . Mathematical modeling of the 1918 pandemic showed that public health interventions to reduce influenza transmission were efficacious only when implemented at very early stages of an epidemic [8] .",

Empiric use of oseltamivir was complicated by co-circulation of other influenza viruses and equal amounts of parainfluenza virus. At a time when pharmacies were depleted of oseltamivir in our city, between 6 and 10 patients needed to be treated empirically for each actual S-OIV infection we identified.

Later, on 8 May 2009, the screening criteria were changed to become more restrictive, prioritizing testing patients with moderate to severe ILI or those with ILI with risk factors for complications of S-OIV infection. Moderate -severe ILI was defined as ILI with evidence of lower respiratory involvement (increased respiratory rates for age with or without accessory muscle use) but not requiring supplemental oxygen, hemodynamic or ventilator support. Patients considered to be at high risk for S-OIV complications were the same age and risk groups as those at higher risk for seasonal influenza complications (< 5 years or \uf0b3 65 years of age, children and adolescents who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy, pregnant women, patients with chronic medical conditions, patients with imunosuppression or residents of nursing homes and other chroniccare facilities) [16] . Testing criteria were further modified by local health authorities on 11 May 2009, to recommend testing of only those who were severely ill (e.g., hospitalized or had symptoms of LRI requiring hemodynamic or respiratory support) or who belonged to the high risk groups. Respiratory specimens tested during the outbreak were obtained from both hospitalized and ambulatory patients of all ages from Southeastern Wisconsin region. The majority of pediatric specimens tested in the study originated from non-hospitalized children, however the precise distribution of adults between inpatient and outpatient groups was not known.
