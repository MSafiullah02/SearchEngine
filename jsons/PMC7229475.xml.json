Initial venous blood gas revealed a PCO2 of 37 mmHg and a venous pH of 7.4. The patient was tested for COVID-19 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Although initial testing was negative, a second test was positive. Subsequent hematology studies revealed the presence of lupus anticoagulant (LAC). Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with incomplete right bundle branch block. Lower-limb compression ultrasonography was positive for a nonocclusive deep venous thromboses (DVT) in the bilateral popliteal veins. The left internal jugular vein, which had been cannulated for central access, was also noted to subsequently develop thrombosis (Video 1).",

The predominant clinical picture appears to be disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with high rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE), elevated d-dimer levels and high fibrinogen levels, in concert with low anti-thrombin levels and pulmonary congestion, with microvascular thrombosis. Recent studies by Zhou et al. and Tang et al. reported a positive correlation between elevated d-dimer levels on hospital admission and in-hospital mortality [2,3]. Tan et al. performed a retrospective analysis of 183 confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrating an 11.5% death rate. Of the patients who died, 86% had elevated d-dimers of \u22653 \u03bcg/ml, and 71% of them developed disseminated intravascular coagulation [3]. In a separate study by Zhou et al., they also found that a d-dimer >1 \u03bcg/ml was a predictor of mortality, with an 81% rate of mortality in those having an elevated d-dimer [2]. In a retrospective study of 449 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, 99 patients received heparin. The study showed a decrease in 28-day mortality among the subgroup of patients with a sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score \u22654 or a d-dimer result that was 6 times the upper limit of normal [4]. Recent guidelines have also suggested that an elevated d-dimer levels are associated with higher risk of requiring mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, or death [5].",
