News article archives help users to learn detailed information on events that occurred at specific time points in the past and constitute part of our heritage [1]. Some professionals, like historians, sociologists, or journalists need to deal with these time-aligned document collections for a variety of purposes [2]. Moreover, average users can verify information about the past using original, primary resources. However, it is difficult for users to efficiently make use of news archives due to their large sizes and complexities. Large scale question answering systems (QA systems) can solve the problem, with the aim to identify the most correct answer from relevant documents for a particular information need, expressed as a natural language question. User questions on these archives are often event-related and include temporal aspects. They can be divided into two types: (1) those with explicit temporal expressions (e.g., \u201cNATO signed a peace treaty with which country in 1999?\u201d), and (2) those only implicitly associated to time periods, hence not containing any temporal expression (e.g., \u201cHow many members of International Olympic Committee were expelled or resigned because of the bribery scandal?\u201d). We focus on the latter type, which is more challenging, as the temporal information cannot be obtained directly. Table 1 shows some examples of the questions that we use.\n",

It exploits the temporal information of a question, of a document content and of its timestamp for reranking candidate documents. In the experiments, we use New York Times (NYT) archive as the underlying knowledge source and a carefully constructed test set of questions which are associated with past events. The questions are selected from existing datasets and history quiz websites, and they lack any temporal expressions which makes them particularly difficult to be answered. Experimental results show that our proposed system improves retrieval effectiveness and outperforms the existing QA systems commonly used for large scale question answering.",

However, recent studies [6\u20138] indicate that IR module is a bottleneck having a significant impact on the performance of the whole system (degraded performance of MRC component due to noisy input). Hence, few works tried to improve the IR task. Chen et al. [9] propose one of the most well-known large scale question answering system, DrQA whose IR component is based on a TF-IDF retriever that uses bigrams with TF-IDF matching. Wang et al.

The questions and documents are then processed in the same way as on synchronic collections. Even though some temporal question answering systems that can exploit temporal information of question and document content have been proposed in the past [11, 12], they are still designed for synchronic document collections (e.g., Wikipedia or Web) and they do not use document timestamps.

[18] propose a method that analyzes query frequencies over time to infer the implicit temporal information of queries and exploit this information for ranking results. Arikan et al. [19] design a temporal retrieval model that integrates temporal expressions of document content into query-likelihood language modeling. Berberich et al. [20] propose a similar model but also consider uncertainty in temporal expressions. However, in [19] and [20], the temporal scopes of queries are explicitly given in their setting and the proposed methods do not utilize timestamp information. Kanhabua and N\u00f8rv\u00e5g [21] propose three different methods to determine the implicit temporal scope of queries and exploit this temporal information to improve the retrieval effectiveness by reranking documents. [21] is probably the most related work to ours as it also linearly combines both textual and temporal similarity to rerank documents, however, that work does not use any temporal information embedded in document content and the linear combination is done in a static way. In our experiments, for comparison with [21] we will replace our ranking method in the reranking module with the best one proposed in [21].\n",

On the other hand, the distribution of relevant documents corresponding to the second question is more complex as it contains many peaks, and documents are not located in a specific short time period, and the number of relevant documents published around the actual event time is relatively small when compared to the total number of relevant documents. However, the distribution line near the actual time of the event (November, 2003) still reveals useful features, i.e, the highest peak (maxima) of the dashed line of the data is near the event time.

The performance improvement is due to the use of temporal information for locating more correct documents which is derived from the question itself, document timestamp and document content. We then compare our model with others by considering the top 1 and top 5 documents. When comparing with the DrQA system, which is often used as QA baseline, the improvement is in the range of 17.77% to 32.14%, and from 24.25% to 33.49% on EM and F1 metrics, respectively.\n",

The events in questions with many bursts are likely to be similar to other events that occurred at different times, which causes the difficulty to distinguish between the events.
