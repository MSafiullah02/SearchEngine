Immunosuppressive regulatory pathways utilized by the fetus for protection against possible infections and maternal\u2013fetal rejection in utero are still reflected in the newborn infant immune system, characterized by immune-suppressive, antiinflammatory, and immature cellular responses to foreign antigens. Although newborns and young infants lack the ability to mount effective immune responses against many pathogens, they acquire initial immune protection through the passive transfer of maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) in utero via the placenta (termed \u201cpassive immunity\u201d)2 and from secretory IgA and antimicrobial factors present in maternal breast milk. Alternations in passive immunity (e.g., preterm birth) can lead to increased susceptibility to infections and breakdown of immune tolerance in the infant. Passive immunity can be enhanced by vaccination of pregnant mothers to promote the transfer of vaccine-specific IgG in utero. However, within the first months of life, as maternal IgG wanes and breastfeeding is discontinued, infants must actively develop their own innate and adaptive immune responses to initiate and maintain immune protection. An overview of the development of innate and adaptive cells, as well as the repertoire of diversity during aging, is outlined in Fig. 38.1\n.",

The most significant functional limitation of neonatal innate immune cells is their collective inability to kill pathogens. Limited chemotaxis in neutrophils is accompanied by a reduced ability to effectively kill pathogens as a result of poor phagocytosis and decreased secretion of neutrophil extracellular traps under inflammatory conditions, which in combination results in decreased killing of infectious pathogens. Moreover, NK cells and plasmacytoid DCs have reduced capacity to prevent infection through reduced cytotoxic function and lower secretion of interferon- (IFN-\u03b1), respectively. In addition, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are unable to provide effective help to T cells because of reduced expression of costimulatory molecules and skewed cytokine production toward more antiinflammatory, T-helper 2 (Th2)\u2013inducing cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). These combined limitations during early infancy lead to increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections and also contribute to the reduced functionality of adaptive immune cells.Image 1 Key Concepts: Characteristics of the Developing Innate Immune System\n\u2022Reduced antibacterial responses (i.e., phagocytosis, secretion of neutrophil extracellular traps [NETs]) by neutrophils and monocytes\u2022Impaired neutrophil chemokinesis (\u201cdirected movement\u201d)\u2022Diminished capacity of antigen-presenting cells (APCs; i.e., dendritic cells [DCs]) to provide proper costimulatory help to T cells\u2022Reduced antiviral responses (i.e., interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 secretion) by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs)\nAlt-text: Unlabelled box\n",

It is important to note that although lymphocytes initially develop within the fetal liver (\u22487 WG) and then in bone marrow (\u224812 WG), T-cell maturation occurs in the thymus, and B cells continue maturation in bone marrow in utero and after birth. Over the course of gestation, both na\u00efve T- cell and B-cell compartments expand, reaching absolute cell concentrations greater than that of the adults by birth. Thus a defect in cellular generation cannot account for the immune limitations observed in infants. However, the composition of the each lymphocyte population within young infants is distinct from that of adults. At birth, both the newborn infant T- and B-cell compartments consist mainly of na\u00efve and immature cells recently migrated out of the thymus or bone marrow (>90% of the population). Both infant T- and B-cell repertoires have less diversity within their receptors' antigen-binding regions compared with those of adults. T-cell receptors display reduced V-J complexity and fewer amino acid additions. In addition, B cells have decreased B-cell receptor diversity because of less affinity maturation (i.e., somatic hypermutation; Chapter 7) compared with adult populations.",

Not only are infants born with limited antigen exposure and thus little memory, infant responses to antigenic stimulation in the T- and B-cell compartments display altered functions compared with that of adults. The most striking alterations are seen within the CD4 T-cell compartment, characterized by significantly increased frequency of immunosuppressive T regulatory cells (Tregs; 30\u201340% in infants vs 1\u201310% in adults).4 These changes accompany increased Th2 subsets and defective differentiation to effector Th1 and T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells during early infancy. Moreover, decreased expression of Lck in infant CD4 T cells leads to decreased T-cell activation upon antigen exposure.2 Altered differentiation of CD4 Th subsets and blunted T-cell activation promotes a tolerance-inducing environment good for controlling unnecessary responses to foreign antigen exposure after birth. However, it also leads to inhibition of effective cytotoxic T cells and limits B-cell antibody responses against infectious pathogens and to vaccination (Fig. 38.2\n).",

Within hours after birth, the infant intestinal tract is colonized with nonpathogenic bacteria (termed \u201cmicrobiome\u201d; Chapter 14). The microbiome can reach concentrations of 1010 bacteria per gram of stool by age 7 days, but only mirrors an adult-like composition after age 2 years. Early studies in animal models demonstrated that microbial colonization is essential for the normal development of the immune system during early infancy and throughout life.6 In particular, IgA, the most abundant antibody within the GI tract, requires the presence of colonizing bacterial for its development and long-term maintenance. Moreover, the specific composition of the microbiome influences the generation of innate lymphoid cells, CD4 T-cells subsets (e.g., Treg, Th17, Tfh), and antibody development. Perturbations in the infant microbiome, caused by such factors as mode of delivery, antibiotic treatment, and diet, may significantly alter developing immune responses.",

Indeed, infections are one of the major causes mortality, accounting for more than 24% of global infant mortality. More than 1 million deaths per year are caused by respiratory tract infections (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]) and almost the same amount by intestinal infections (e.g., rotavirus, Escherichia coli). The development and distribution of vaccines targeting these pathogens have significantly reduced infant infection rates and subsequent mortality; however, vaccine efficacy can vary, depending on the infant's gestational age at birth, mode of vaccine delivery (oral vs intramuscular), interference by maternal antibodies acquired through passive immunity and via breast milk, and immaturity of infant immune responses, as described above. Additionally, infants require multiple vaccine boosters to elicit and maintain robust protective immunity against infectious pathogens (Chapter 90). Better understanding of the limitations of the human infant immune system that prevent effective immune responses, particularly at mucosal sites where these pathogens initially infect, would facilitate the generation of better vaccines designed to overcome these limitations and induce more rapid and robust immune protection during early infancy.Image 3 Clinical Relevance: Consequences of Immaturity of the Developing Immune System\n\u2022Increased morbidity and mortality from bacterial infections (e.g., pneumococci)\u2022Increased morbidity and mortality from viral infection (e.g., influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV])\u2022Ineffective primary vaccinations; multiple boosters required for most vaccines to elicit effective protection\u2022Susceptibility to allergy and asthma when microbiome colonization disrupted during early infancy\nAlt-text: Unlabelled box\n",

Additionally, for lymphocytes, which are more long-lived but are also more numerous because of their wider tissue distribution, the daily need is in the order of several billion cells. Studies in the 1960s showed that the hematopoietic tissue in bone marrow decreases with age. A similar decline is seen for the frequencies of peripheral CD34+CD45+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In addition to these numerical differences, the functional potential of HSCs changes with age.7 Old HSCs exhibit a reduced capacity to regenerate the hematopoietic system. Telomerase expression in peripheral HSCs is not fully protective, and a shortening in telomeric length is seen with age, similar to differentiated mononuclear cells. Lymphoid differentiation potential diminishes with age in favor of myeloid differentiation as a result of altered lineage specification programs driven by DNA damage and epigenetic changes. This shift may contribute to the clinical observation that HSC-derived leukemia preferentially has a lymphoid phenotype in the young and a myeloid one in older adults.Image 4 Key Concepts: Aging Influences Immune Cell Generation and Population HomeostasisAging influences immune cell generation and population homeostasis.\u2022Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are reduced in frequency and biased toward myeloid lineages and against lymphoid lineages.\u2022Myeloid cell generation is largely intact.\u2022B-cell generation declines and B-cell repertoire selection is disturbed.\u2022As a result of thymic involution, na\u00efve T cells are generated from homeostatic proliferation of peripheral T cells.\u2022Ability to rebuild a T-cell repertoire after lymphocyte-depleting interventions is severely compromised after mid-adulthood.\u2022Virus-specific effector T-cell population accumulates.\nAlt-text: Unlabelled box\n",

Moreover, the frequency of typical memory B cells expressing CD27 declines, whereas other B-cell subpopulations increase. In particular, a functionally distinct B-cell population that responds to Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation has been described.9 These age-associated differences in B-cell selection and expansion may contribute to monoclonal gammopathies (in >5% of individuals older than 70 years; Chapter 80) or increased autoantibodies with increasing age. High-throughput sequencing of Ig genes has the promise to provide insights into the age-associated decline in B-cell responses at the single-cell level. Data so far have indicated that older individuals have prevaccination-expanded B-cell populations that have a high mutation load and are further expanded with vaccination, suggesting that the B-cell response in older individuals relies on the adaptation of a restricted repertoire of memory sequences.",

The thymus undergoes dramatic structural changes that begin during childhood and puberty.10 Thymopoietic niches disappear, and the numbers of thymic epithelial cells and thymocytes decline. In parallel, the thymic perivascular space increases. One major structural change that does not appear to be a compensatory response but, rather, is an active and regulated developmental step in thymic organ transformation is the accumulation and infiltration of adipocytes in the perivascular space. Thymic resection in children undergoing cardiac surgery reproduces many of the T-cell repertoire changes in 20-year-old individuals that are usually seen in 70- to 80-year-olds, confirming that thymic production during the growth period of childhood and adolescence is important. However, throughout adulthood, homeostatic proliferation of na\u00efve T cells accounts for the bulk of T-cell generation.11 For human CD4 T cells, this process is robust, and frequencies of na\u00efve CD4 T cells only moderately decline with age. In contrast, the na\u00efve CD8 T-cell compartment clearly shrinks. However, repertoire diversity (i.e., the number of different T-cell receptors [TCRs]) remains very high for both na\u00efve CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets, suggesting that thymic activity is not necessary to prevent holes in the repertoire once a repertoire has formed. Strategies to reactivate thymic T-cell generation will be more important in older patients who cannot restore the na\u00efve T-cell repertoire after a medical intervention, such as chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, compared with their healthy counterparts.",

Infections therefore leave a permanent imprint on the immune system, a mechanism on which vaccinations capitalize. However, the pathogen-induced clonal expansion also represents a challenge to homeostatic mechanisms that are supposed to maintain a balance among na\u00efve, memory, and effector cells.12 This is particularly evident in persisting infections where the offending pathogen cannot be cleared. Herpes virus infections are highly prevalent in an apparently healthy population without causing active disease, as they establish latency. Classic examples are varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). The effects of these herpes viruses with immune aging differ greatly; VZV tends to relapse with age, with reactivation presenting as shingles. A decrease in the frequency of VZV-specific CD4 memory T cells has been postulated to explain this lack in viral control mechanisms. In contrast, EBV and CMV infections only relapse in severely immunocompromised individuals, but not during normal immune aging. The immune system commits extraordinary resources to controlling CMV, and CMV-specific CD8 T cells can make up a large fraction of the entire T-cell repertoire. Whether this memory inflation has broader implications for immune health remains a matter of controversy. Expansion of the CMV-specific T cells may compromise the size of na\u00efve and central memory T cell repertoires; however, many of the CMV-specific CD8 T cells have the phenotype of end-differentiated effector T cells that lack the expression of CCR7, CD28, and CD27 and therefore do not compete for the same space as na\u00efve cells.",

Increased IL-6 and cross-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels and increased white blood cell (WBC) counts, presumably resulting from increased production of neutrophils, predispose to, and are associated with, frailty. A causative relationship may also exist between the increased production of IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1 and the age-associated loss in muscle mass, eventually presenting as sarcopenia.

Proliferation alone may be sufficient to drive initial steps of differentiation. A classic example is the acquisition of memory-like and effector phenotypes with lymphopenia-induced homeostatic proliferation. So-called virtual memory cells, which presumably have never seen an exogenous antigen, have been identified in mouse models; clonal expansions are also seen within the human na\u00efve T-cell compartment.

Changes in cell surface molecules that are seen with terminal differentiation, such as the gain in CD57 and the loss of CD27 and CD28 expression, are the most striking. Of functional importance, predominantly for CD8 T cells, is the gain in expression of cell surface receptors that are usually only found in NK cells.

The frequencies of different innate and adaptive B and T cells changes over the course of a lifetime (upper three panels). In addition to compartment size, diversity of antigen receptors is essential for immune function. During infancy, diversity of immune populations expands and is then maintained during adulthood (lower panel). Aging is characterized by the general decline in diversity within na\u00efve B- and T-cell populations. Dotted lines indicate that the progression of these populations is either controversial or unknown.",

The infant immune environment is distinctly antiinflammatory characterized by altered Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling from monocytes, blunted T-cell and B-cell receptor (TCR/BCR) signaling, and skewing toward T regulatory cells (Tregs). Infant B cells are incapable of class-switch recombination (CSR) or affinity maturation via somatic hypermutation (SHM) upon antigen exposure. Altered monocyte TLR signaling and altered function of adaptive immune cells is also observed in older adults, but with a distinct, more proinflammatory outcome.",
