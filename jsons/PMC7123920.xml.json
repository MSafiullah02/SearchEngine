The ability of amphibians to survive in such different conditions may be attributed to the evolution of many different morphological, physiological, biochemical and behavioral adaptations. Like for other species, skin is one of the most important organs for amphibians, as it fulfills many functions such as i) respiration, (ii) water regulation and (iii) defense (barrier). Glands are major functional components of the skin of amphibians. Three types of glands are widely distributed in amphibians\u2019 skin: mucus glands, granular glands and the tubulosaccular or alveolar glands [1]. Mucus glands help to maintain a moisture and slippery skin surface. Granular glands are the place of a wide range of chemical compounds synthesis. Their secretions have a protective function against bacterial and fungal infection as well as predators [3]. Main types of amphibian skin biologically active compounds are: biogenic amines, bufodienolides (bufogenines and bufotoxins = steroids), alkaloids, peptides and proteins [4, 5].",

            "text": "Amphibian skin, especially granular gland secretions, is a rich source of novel therapeutic agents such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), polypeptides and proteins. An important event in this area was the discovery of magainins peptides isolated from the skin of Xenopus laevis [6]. Magainins exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, inhibiting the growth of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformansand, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and also demonstrated to induce lysis in several protozoan species [6]. Those discoveries stimulated great interest in amphibian skin peptides [7, 8]. These peptides are stored in granular glands, which are localized mostly in the skin of dorsal area and are surrounded by myocytes and innervated by sympathetic fibers [9, 10]. Adrenergic stimulation of myocytes leads to compression of serous cells, which discharge their contents by a holocrine-like mechanism. As a result, secretions contain not only antimicrobial peptides and other biologically-active agents, but also cytosolic components and cells\u2019 genetic material [11]. The main advantage of using amphibian skin as the object of investigation is the use of gentle methods (e.g. skin stimulation by norepinephrine [12] or gentle electrical stimulation [13] for sample preparation. Hence, there is no need to harm or kill animals for this work.",

            "text": "The amino acid sequence of Brevinin-1 is poorly conserved across species and has four invariant residues (Ala9, Cys18, Lys23, Cys24) [24]. Pro14 is often present in Brevinin-1 peptides, and it was shown that this residue produces a stable kink in the molecule [25]. Functional activities of antibacterial peptides are largely determined by their structural features. The presence of cationic amino acids facilitates the interaction of Brevinins with the anionic phospholipids of the bacterial membranes and with negatively charged eukaryotic cell membranes (cancer cells, erythrocytes). In aqueous solution, Brevinin-1 exists predominantly as a random coil but adopts an amphipathic \u03b1-helical structure in hydrophobic membrane-mimetic environment such as 50 % trifluoroethanol [26]. It has been postulated that the \u03b1-helical structure in such an environment leads to perturbation of the phospholipid bilayer of targeted membranes. Such membrane function disturbances lead to growth inhibition or death of the targeted microorganisms. This hypothesis correlates with experimental results performed with synthetic D-amino acids peptides [27]. Biological activity of such analogs were similar to their corresponding native peptides, so a mechanism based on an interaction with chiral binding sites of receptors, enzymes, or other membrane proteins can be ruled out. The number and distribution of positive charges could be the cause of selectivity for some of these peptides to bacterial membranes [9]. Two main mechanisms of amphipathica-helical peptides interactions with membranes were suggested: the \u201cbarrel-stave\u201d (Fig. 10.1a) and the \u201ccarpet-like\u201d models (Fig. 10.1b) [28, 29]. The primary structure of Brevinin-2 is also poorly conserved with the invariant amino acid residues in the peptide being Lys7, Cys27, Lys28, Cys33 [23].\n",

            "text": "Various AMPs belonging to different families and their cDNAs have been cloned. A prokaryotic expression system such as Escherichia coli is commonly applied. AMPs are expressed in E. coli as fusion proteins to protect the bacterial host from the lethal effect of AMP and the peptide from proteolytic degradation. Several major fusion-protein systems for the expression of AMPs in E. coli have been reported which are summarized here:Thioredoxin as a low-molecular weight protein (~12 kDa) has been frequently exploited as carrier protein of antimicrobial peptides. This protein exhibits a chaperon activity that can promote the expression of recombinant peptides in E. coli.GST (glutathione S-transferase) is a commonly used carrier protein for fusion expression of antimicrobial peptides in E. coli. GST fusion proteins can be quickly purified from crude lysate by glutathione-affinity chromatography. The commercial GST-fusion plasmids usually contain a specific protease recognition site releasing the desired peptide from the fusion protein. Due to the relatively large size (~26 kDa) of GST, the efficiency of the system decreases and makes the fusion highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation as well.PurF fusion, the protein fragment containing the N-terminal 152 amino acids of PurF (amidophosphoribosyltransferase) is widely used as a carrier for the expression of antimicrobial peptides. Insoluble expression of AMP PurF fusions can not only protect the host cell from the peptides\u2019 intrinsic toxic effects but also effectively protect the peptides from proteolytic digestion. The inclusion bodies of PurF fusions can be easily removed from the cell lysate by centrifugation.Inteins chitin-binding domain: upon applying intein system, the usage of exogenous proteases or chemicals is eliminated to remove the carrier protein. Consequently, the downstream process of expression is simplified, and the target protein can be obtained at high purity in a one-step purification employing a single column.Npro fusion technology, which benefits from autoproteolytic function of N-terminal autoprotease, while Npro is originally extracted from classical swine fever virus (CSFV). The target protein/peptide is fused to the C-terminus of Npro and is expressed in inclusion bodies in E. coli. The expressed fusion protein must be dissolved under chaotropic condition. Upon switching to cosmotropic in vitro refolding conditions, the fused partner with an authentic N-terminus is released from the C-terminal end of the autoprotease by self-cleavage. A special Npro mutant called EDDIE has been designed for preparative application, which possesses a better solubility and cleavage rates [35\u201338].A few peptides of the Brevinin family have been purified through the thioredoxin fusion system so far. The synthetic gene of Brevinin-2R has been also cloned into the pET32a (+) vector to allow the expression of Brevinin-2R as a Trx fusion protein in E. coli [39]. Brevinin-2GU, an antimicrobial peptide isolated from skin secretion of the Asian frog Hylarana guntheri possesses insulin-releasing activity. The coding sequence of Brevinin-2GU gene has been expressed using pET32a (+) vector as a Trx fusion protein in E. coli to produce over a 45 % yield of the total cell proteins. After purifying the soluble fusion protein by Ni2+-chelating chromatography, the fusion partner was cleaved by Factor Xa protease to release mature Brevinin-2GU [40].",

Brevinin-2R kills different tumor cells (Jurkat, BJAB, MCF-7, L929, A549) at 1\u201310 \u03bcg/ml concentration, and exerts higher cytotoxicity in comparison with commercial doxorubicin and cisplatin drugs (P < 0.0001). In experiments with normal cell lines (CD3+ T cells from human donor and lung fibroblast), the level of cytotoxicity was approximately two times lower [45]. Brevinin-2 kills cells in a caspase-independent manner, implying cell death mechanisms other than classical apoptosis. After treatment with Brevinin-2R, a decrease of both the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) and the ATP level was observed [45].",

            "text": "The main mechanism of its anticancer action is most likely the same as for pathogens namely the modification of membrane properties, especially membrane permeability. Brevinins preferentially interact with cancer cells because the outer membrane surface of these cells has an additional negative charge due to the presence of higher levels of O-glycosylated mucines [46], negatively charged phosphatidylserines [47] or higher number of microvilli, which leads to increasing of membrane surface area [48]. Also it was found that Brevinin-2R interacts with the lysosomal compartment, initiating lysosomal damage and cathepsin leakage into the cytosol, which leads to cell damage. These data suggest that Brevinin-2R-induced cell death also involves autophagy processes [45].",

These values were comparable to those produced by insulinotropic peptides, GLP-1 and GIP (under the same experimental conditions). Unfortunately, however, the peptides were cytotoxic at the tested concentrations [53]. Also, it was shown that increasing the cationicity of B2RP (Asp4 \u2192 Lys) enhanced the insulin-releasing potency (137 % of basal rate at a concentration of 0.3 \u03bcM; p < 0.05), while increasing amphipathicity and hydrophobicity showed reduced insulin-releasing potency of analog [50].

Liu and colleagues introduced core-shell nanoparticles formed by self-assembly of amphiphilic peptide with potential antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens including bacteria and fungi [56]. Peptides, particularly cationic peptides, belonging to the Brevinin family represented antimicrobial effect against several multi-drug resistant microorganisms [45].

Thus, a Brevinin functionalized nanostructure would be of great importance from the objective of developing advanced functional bionanomaterials with antimicrobial properties. Researchers reported the functionalization of a novel gold-based nanocarrier with a therapeutic application (PMI (p12)) as well as a receptor-targeted (CRGDK) peptide to investigate the biological and medicinal effects of conjugated gold nanoparticles on breast cancer cells [57].

The \u201ccarpet-like\u201d model (b), predicts that peptides accumulate massively at the membrane interphase. Such sequestration of the membrane would lead to the disruption of the membrane integrity. The \u201ctwo-states\u201d (toroidal) model (c) could be interpreted as a variant of the \u201ccarpet-like\u201d model, however with a different final outcome. The massive peptide accumulation creates mechanical tension. To relieve that tension, some peptides are forced to adopt a transmembrane orientation, forming a mixed phospholipid-peptide pore spanning the membrane. In a further step, the pore undergoes a stochastic disruption (loses its wall-integrity,with relocation of the monomers at both sides of the membrane), and thus membrane destabilization leading to the loss of its integrity",
