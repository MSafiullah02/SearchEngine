Although the onset phase of this illness takes many years in most patients, once significant respiratory obstruction has developed, the prognosis is poor. The 10-year mortality of a cohort of 60-year-old nonatopic smokers rose to 60% compared with 15% in nonsmoking asthmatic subjects.10\n",

In the 1970s, male death rates ranged from 33/100,000 in social class 1 to 97,115, and 191/100,000, respectively, in classes 3, 4, and 5.11 Epidemiologic surveys, for example in England and Wales,12 have suggested that recurrent respiratory tract infections in childhood, consequent upon the poor social conditions of the 1920s, may have predisposed to the development of chronic bronchitis in later life and that such factors may have had a greater influence on the geographic distribution of the disease than cigarette smoking. However, numerous studies have shown a positive correlation between mortality rates from chronic bronchitis and smoking, perhaps the most convincing describing this relationship among British doctors.13\n",

Another study of 214 patients found this organism in almost 30% of sputum cultures.22\n",

In the United Kingdom, this accounts for a substantial proportion of the 17.2 million antibiotic prescriptions issued per year (Intercontinental Medical Statistics, MDI Dec 1993, MAT). However, between 13 and 25% of such patients with lower respiratory tract infections treated on a domiciliary basis return within a matter of a few weeks because of persisting symptoms.6, 7, 28 It is thus necessary to question whether antibiotic therapy per se is effective in AECB, and if so, whether certain of the newer antibiotics, which have improved in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics, are likely to prove more effective than traditional agents such as the broad spectrum penicillins. It is perhaps even more important to assess the evidence for the efficacy of rapid, effective therapy of acute exacerbations in preventing the inexorable decline in respiratory function which characterises this disease. Anthonisen and colleagues29 found that the acute reduction in FEV1 associated with AECB improved more rapidly with antibiotic therapy than with placebo. However, a comprehensive literature review18 found only one study which indicated recurrent infective exacerbations to have any long-term detrimental effect on pulmonary function in chronic bronchitics.",

Patients allocated antibiotic therapy received either amoxycillin (40%), co-trimoxazole (40%), or doxycycline (20%). Although the results overall indicated a significant difference in favor of antibiotic treatment, optimal benefits were observed in patients who had exacerbations characterized by increases in dyspnea, sputum production, and sputum purulence (often termed the \u201cWinnipeg criteria\u201d). Subsequently, an Italian group31b studying a similarly sized population, showed a highly significant difference in favor of co-amoxyclav (Augmentin) compared with placebo in patients with standardized disease severity. This group based their assessment on an empiric scoring system which incorporated the Winnipeg criteria together with additional factors, including the presence and degree of pyrexia, severity of cough, and presence of coexistent cardiopulmonary disease. The results of these and earlier studies are shown in Table 3.",

However, insistence by many registration authorities that new drugs must be compared to traditional agents such as amoxycillin and that for standard evaluation, all isolates should be sensitive to both the investigational and comparator agents often results in failure to prove what should be clear advantages.",

Reviews of the efficacy of fluoroquinolones in AECB indicate response rates of 80 to 95%, and trials of ciprofloxacin have frequently demonstrated superiority to standard agents such as ampicillin, cefaclor, cephalexin, and josamycin in terms of bacterial eradication, notably of H influenzae.56 Prior to its abrupt withdrawal, temafloxacin, which had enhanced activity against the pneumococcus, appeared to have a very promising future.79 Sparfloxacin also has similarly improved activity, but proved only equivalent to co-amoxiclav by both evaluables and intention to treat analyses in a double-blind, multicenter study of 734 adults with exacerbations conforming to Winnipeg type 1 criteria.80 The increasing prevalence of resistance to standard antibiotics among respiratory pathogens may soon elevate the fluoroquinolones to a position of primary choice in the management of moderate-to-severe exacerbations, an outcome supported by the development of new compounds, such as Bay 3118 and CP 99,219, which have even greater Gram-positive activity.",

Despite this, very few trials have succeeded in demonstrating the superiority of novel agents which offer significant improvements in antibacterial activity and respiratory tissue/fluid penetration, over standard antibiotics. Thus, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin should prove superior to agents such as amoxycillin and cefaclor, but very few studies based on assessments at the end of therapy have confirmed more than equivalence.54, 56, 57, 75 In some cases, this may relate to the assessment criteria used. Thus if, as in the studies on fluoroquinolones by Davies and his group,78 clinical response and pathogen eradication are insisted upon, the reappearance of a pathogen in follow-up studies a week after therapy may be interpreted as overall failure. However, it is increasingly recognized that H influenzae and pneumococci may persist in bronchial secretions despite apparently satisfactory clinical response,24, 25 calling into question this method of assessment.",

For example, Pines and colleagues70 found no difference between amoxycillin and co-trimoxazole at the end of therapy but only a third receiving co-trimoxazole remained free of relapse at 2 to 4-week follow-up compared with 72% of those who had received amoxycillin. This difference was statistically significant.70 Chodosh,52 analyzing long-term follow-up data on a series of trials in AECB, has shown that the mean time from the end of therapy of one exacerbation to the onset of the next may allow more reliable assessment of comparative efficacy. Thus, if the time to relapse after ampicillin therapy (about 200 days) is taken as the index value, ratios for the same periods applicable to other agents can be calculated. Using this approach, the poor performance of oral cephalosporins is emphasized, the ratios for cephalexin and cefaclor being 0.31, indicating much earlier relapse after treatment with these compounds. In contrast, the efficacy of the quinolones is demonstrated by such methods. Ciprofloxacin (208 days to relapse) and temafloxacin (235 days) offer ratios equal to or in excess of unity when compared with ampicillin.79\n",

For example, Petrie and coworkers58 found the relapse rate 3 months after azithromycin therapy of hospitalized patients conforming to Winnipeg type 1 exacerbation criteria29 to be significantly lower (46 vs 62%) than that for patients treated with amoxycillin. Clearly, the advantages of quinolones, new macrolides, and azalides are augmented by the relative lack of resistance among respiratory pathogens: for example, a recent study noted that only 105 of 162 isolates from AECB were ampicillin-sensitive.76\n",

Empirically based systems such as the Winnipeg criteria29 and the Italian composite score31b may define acute exacerbations, but no studies were undertaken to correlate their observations with outcome and thus with severity. We have performed an observational study of 471 patients with acute exacerbations, recording historic and clinical parameters at presentation and follow-up, and relating these to outcome, utilizing stepwise logistic regression techniques.7 The results show that, while they may accurately define an exacerbation, none of the Winnipeg criteria (increase in dyspnea, sputum production, and sputum purulence) either singly or in combination predict outcome. The two factors found positively to predict return to the family practitioner with similar symptoms within 4 weeks of the initial presentation were (1) frequent exacerbations (>4) within the previous year, and (2) significant comorbidity (unrelated cardiopulmonary disease). The latter factor conforms to similar observations relating to outcome of bacterial pneumonia.81, 82 Trials comparing new quinolones, macrolides, azalides, and other antibiotic classes with traditional compounds should, in the future, be performed in patients who conform to these and the Winnipeg criteria and should involve assessments both at the end of therapy and through extended follow-up. Real differences might then appear in favor of the new agents which could be translated into improved patient care.",
