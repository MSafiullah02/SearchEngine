Similar motifs are also present in other RNA viruses. Two fecal specimens and 18 litter extracts collected from chickens and turkeys yielded RT-PCR products. BLAST search and phylogenetic analysis revealed that all amplicons represented picornaviruses that clustered into two major groups. Four chicken and one turkey samples yielded 250 bp amplicons with 84-91% nucleotide identity to the recently described turkey hepatitis viruses, while 280 and 283 bp amplicons obtained from 11 chicken and 4 turkey samples represented novel picornaviruses with the closest nucleotide identity to kobuviruses (54-61%) and turdiviruses (47-54%). Analysis of 2.2-3.2 kb extended genome sequences including the partial P2 (2C) and complete P3 (3A, 3B (VPg), 3C pro , and 3D pol ) regions of selected strains indicated that viruses yielding the 280/283 bp amplicons represent a putative new genus of Picornaviridae. The 3 0 -non-translated region (NTR) of the turkey hepatitis-like viruses described in this study was significantly longer (641-654 nt) than that of any of the other piconaviruses and included a putative short open reading frame (ORF). In summary, we report the molecular detection of novel picornaviruses that appear to be endemic in both chickens and turkeys.",

All known picornavirus genomes encode a single long open reading frame (ORF) from which a long polyprotein is translated and cleaved by virus encoded proteases to yield the individual structural and non-structural viral proteins. The long ORF has been divided into three regions: P1, P2, and P3. The P1 region encodes the viral capsid proteins while the P2 and P3 regions encode proteins involved in protein processing or genome replication: 2A pro , 2B, 2C and 3A, 3B (VPg), 3C pro , 3D pol , respectively. Picornaviruses have been described in humans and different animal species and can be the causative agents of a wide variety of diseases. The Picornaviridae family currently consists of 12 genera: Enterovirus, Cardiovirus, Aphtovirus, Hepatovirus, Parechovirus, Erbovirus, Kobuvirus, Teschovirus, Sapelovirus, Senecavirus, Tremovirus, and Avihepatovirus [1] . Several other picornaviruses including the recently described turdiviruses and turkey hepatitis viruses still await species or genus assignment.",

The P3 region of picornaviruses encode proteins 3A, 3B (VPg), 3C pro (protease), and 3D pol (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). For strains CHK165, CHK175, TRK90, and TRK91 a segment (*1 kb) stretching from the P290 primer binding site of 3D pol to the poly-A tail was amplified. For strains CHK148, CHK168, TRK22, and TRK24 a segment (*1.8-2.2 kb) stretching from the GxCG motif of 3C pro to the poly-A tail was amplified. Finally, for strain CHK1 a segment (*3.2 kb) stretching from the DDxGQ motif of the 2C protein to the poly-A tail was amplified. Phylogenetic and distance analyses of the complete 3D pol amino acid sequences placed genus 1 viruses closer to Turdivirus 1 (''Orthoturdivirus'') than our original analyses based on partial RdRp sequences, indicating that genus 1 viruses may represent a highly divergent species of ''Orthoturdiviruses'' rather than a new genus (Fig. 2a) . However, analyses of the partial 2C and the 3A-3C region supported their classification as a new genus ( Fig. 2b ; Table 3 ). The 3 0 -NTR sequences of genus 2 (THV-like) viruses obtained in this study were significantly longer than any of the other picornaviruses (Table 3 ). These long 3 0 -NTRs contained a short open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative protein (98-114 aa) (Fig. 3) . BLAST searches of these ORFs did not reveal any similarity to known proteins in public databases.",

            "text": "Based on the previous description of calicivirus-like particles in avian species [5] [6] [7] , including chickens with RSS [4, 8] the initial goal of our study was the molecular detection of caliciviruses in avian fecal specimens. Fecal swabs collected from broiler chickens, domestic ducks, turkeys, and Canadian geese in Delaware, and litter extracts collected from chicken and turkey farms in North Carolina were tested using P289/P290 (Table 1) . With the exception of the 28 swabs collected from RSS positive chickens in Delaware, all of the fecal specimens represented healthy animals. Data on the health status of North Carolina flocks (litter extracts) were not available. The primers (P289/P290) used in this study are targeting nucleotide sequences encoding for conserved amino acid motifs (YGDD and DY(T/S)(R/K/G) WDST) in the calicivirus RdRps. However, RdRps of RNA viruses because of their common evolutionary origin share several conserved motifs. Indeed, using P289/P290 for the detection of caliciviruses in several previous studies resulted in the unintentional detection of RNA viruses including rotavirus, porcine kobuvirus and astrovirus [14] [15] [16] . Similarly, in this study novel picornaviruses were serendipitously amplified with amplicons that were indistinguishable from the calicivirus positive control by size (Fig. 4) . Analysis of the complete 3D pol sequences of CHK1, CHK148, CHK168, TRK22, TR24, and the THVs revealed *16-18 nt match in the 23 nt P290 binding site, with DYSCFDST and DYS-CFDSS amino acid motifs for genus 1 and genus 2 viruses, respectively. Recently, two reports describing the molecular detection of caliciviruses in avian species were published. Day et al. [17] reported a partial calicivirus sequence (936 nt) identified in a metagenomic analysis of turkey gut RNA virus community and Wolf et al. [18] reported the full genome sequence (7908 nt) of a chicken calicivirus detected in two clinically normal and one RSS chicken. Both of these caliciviruses are genetically related to but distinct from Sapovirus and represent two putative new genera of Caliciviridae. Unfortunately, there is no published data on the prevalence of these avian caliciviruses and their role in disease still needs to be established. Surprisingly, despite the relatively large number and diverse samples tested, caliciviruses were not detected in any of the samples including the 28 chicken samples collected from chickens with RSS. The primers used in our study could not be evaluated directly for their ability to detect the avian caliciviruses but sequence analysis of the chicken calicivirus [18] indicated a good match for primer binding at the sites encoding for the DYSGWDST and YGDD amino acid motifs. Picornaviruses were detected both in chicken and turkey samples including two fecal swabs collected from chickens with RSS, 13 litter samples collected from egg layers and 5 litter samples collected from turkey farms ( Table 2) . Phylogenetic analyses of partial 3D pol sequences divided the 20 picornaviruses into two distinct clusters (Fig. 1) . Both clusters contained viruses detected in both chicken and turkey samples suggesting that these picornaviruses can infect both avian species.",

Phylogeny of the complete 3D pol sequences separately indicated that genus 1 viruses might represent a highly divergent species of ''Orthoturdivirus'' (Fig. 2a) , however, this was not supported by analyses of the partial 2C and the 3A-3C regions which placed genus 1 viruses further apart from ''Orthoturdivirus'' supporting their classification as a new genus ( Fig. 2b ; In accordance with the results of the phylogenetic distance analysis, alignments of the separate P3 proteins revealed that CHK1 3D pol region alone shared a higher (62%), while the 3A-3C pro region of P3 and the available partial 2C region of P2 shared a lower (28 and 41%, respectively) amino acid identity with Turdivirus 1 (Table 3) . Ortho-and paraturdiviruses were discovered recently in tracheal and cloacal swabs obtained from dead wild birds of the genus Turdus in the family Turdidae [2] . Turdiviruses could not be propagated in cell culture or in chicken embryos and their prevalence, host range, and disease burden are unknown. Based on our analysis, genus 1 viruses described in this study represent a putative new picornavirus genus with the closest evolutionary roots to Orthoturdivirus. Since genus 1 viruses were described in chicken and turkey samples we propose the tentative name ''Gallivirus'' for the genus. For the final classification and nomenclature of genus 1 viruses, analysis of complete genome sequences, their host range, pathogenicity, and antigenic relationships needs to be determined. The remaining five picornavirus sequences (genus 2) clustered separately from genus 1 viruses and together with the recently described THVs [3] (Fig. 1) . Pairwise amino acid alignments of the complete 3D pol revealed a high (97-99%) homology between TRK22, CHK148, and the THVs. The published sequences of the turkey hepatitis viruses did not include the complete 5 0 and 3 0 -NTRs. In this study complete 3 0 -NTR sequences of three genus 2 viruses (CHK148, CHK178, and TRK22) were obtained revealing a significantly longer 3 0 -NTR region (641-654 nt) than that of any other picornaviruses ( Table 3) . Aligments of the 3 0 -NTRs with the partial (137 and 172 nt) 3 0 -NTR regions that were published for THVs clearly separated the chicken and turkey viruses into two groups. CHK148 and CHK178 had a 52-55% nucleotide identity with THV0091 and THV2993D, while TRK22 exhibited a 82-89% identity to THV0091 and THV2993D, respectively. Moreover, an eight nucleotide deletion was clearly conserved among THV0091 and THV2993D and TRK22.",

The putative short ORF sequences of CHK148 and CHK178 had 93% nucleotide and 99% amino acid identity to each other but only 53% nucleotide and 34% amino acid identity and 50% amino acid similarity to the TRK22 short ORF.

Whether these ORFs encode for a functional protein or the relevance of the unusually long 3 0 -NTR of these viruses remains to be established in future studies.",

As sequences at the extreme 3 0 -ends of picornaviruses, arteriviruses, and coronaviruses are important for antigenome and subsequent genome synthesis [21] , and given the limited sequence identity among the strains examined, we used a structural alignment-based set of programs to predict common structural elements of these 3 0 -NTRs.

Since THVs are the proposed causative agents of turkey hepatitis, evaluation of the pathogenicity of these viruses in chickens is important. Preliminary studies indicate that both CHK148 and TRK22 can be propagated in embryonated chicken eggs (unpublished data). Efforts for the tissue culture adaptation of the picornaviruses described in this study were unsuccessful. Virus isolation from fecal material can be difficult due to low virus load, toxicity of the material, and the abundance of diverse viral agents that often overgrow the target virus. Many enteric viruses require polarized epithelial cells for replication and may have species-specific requirements. More cell lines and primary cell cultures should be evaluated in future studies.

Boxed sequences in alignments b and c correlate with the boxed loops in the secondary structure predications and are provided for reference and orientation In summary, we described the molecular detection of novel picornaviruses in chicken and turkey samples, including viruses that were recently suggested to be the causative agents of turkey hepatitis. These viruses represent two possible new genera of Picornaviridae that appear to be endemic in both chickens and turkeys. Further characterization of these viruses including their host range and prevalence and studies to link infection to clinical disease such as hepatitis or RSS are necessary.",
