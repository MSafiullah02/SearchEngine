Chronic lung diseases, such as COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), are characterized by extensive changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM), the three-dimensional (3D) scaffold that provides mechanical and biochemical support/signals to cells. The ECM is often an underrecognized element in lung disease (4, 13, 29). However, increasing evidence suggests that the ECM plays an active role in lung pathophysiology.",

The lung ECM is a viscoelastic network of both elastic and nonelastic constructive fibrillar proteins embedded in a water-retaining gel of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. Viscoelastic materials exhibit time-dependent strain often measured as relaxation when undergoing deformation (6). Viscoelasticity as a mechanical property influences cellular spreading, proliferation, and differentiation, together with or independently of stiffness (7, 8). For the lung, which undergoes repeated stretch and relaxation, usually greater than 14,000 times each day, replicating the mechanical properties of the ECM is essential to accurately model the cellular environment in vitro.",

Natural hydrogels have been generated from, e.g. decellularized human adipose (20), heart (15), and liver (17) tissue and more (1, 9, 23, 25). As for the lung, hydrogels have been generated from porcine lung ECM (22). ECM hydrogels are generated from intact tissue by detergent-based decellularization then gentle proteolytic solubilization (often with pepsin). Upon pH neutralization and bringing to physiological osmolarity, hydrogels form spontaneously at 37\u00b0C. As such, these hydrogels comprise the native ECM composition, albeit not the macroscopic (micrometer sized) architecture (10, 23).",

Twenty milligrams of whole tissue and dECM powder was solubilized in 1 mL of RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) containing 4 \u00b5L of proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 10 \u00b5L of phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 20 mg of pre-gel was prepared. The solubilized tissue, dECM powder, and pepsin-digested ECM solution were mixed 1:1 with 2\u00d7 sample buffer and separated on 5% and 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue for 1 h and destained with 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid. Images of the stained gels were subsequently digitized.",

The LabVIEW 7.1 program was used for the LLCT load cell and linear positioning for control and data acquisition. The resolution in position, load, and time determination was 0.1 mm, 2 mg, and 25 ms, respectively, and the velocity of motion was controlled in feedback mode. The top plate moved downward (5 \u00b5m/s) until it experienced a counterforce of 10\u22124 N. Samples were deformed by 20% of their original thickness (strain \u03b5 = 0.2) at a deformation speed of 20%/s (strain rate \u03b5\u0307 = 0.2 s\u22121). The diameter of the indentation probe was 2.5 mm. The deformation was held constant for 200 s and the required stress monitored. During compression, the required stress was plotted against the strain. In this plot, a linear increase in stress as a function of strain was observed between a strain of 0.04 and 0.1; the slope of the line fit to this region was taken as stiffness (Young\u2019s modulus). Since the stiffness of the viscoelastic gel depends on the strain rate, values reported here are valid only at a strain rate of 0.2 s\u22121.",

Linking specific hydrogel components such as water, molecules, cells, or ECM to individual Maxwell elements remains difficult, such that currently these remain mathematical entities with no clear biological correlations as yet. However, in bacterial biofilms the constituent components were attributed to Maxwell elements with regard to their contributions to viscoelastic relaxation (21). For dECM hydrogels, the first element made the greatest contribution to the relaxation sequence, possibly reflecting the major role played by the water content of dECM hydrogels and absence of cell-derived or other tissue-related cross-links. In tissue each element contributed more equally to the relaxation process, except in IPF tissue. The 4th, slowest, element made the largest contribution to the relaxation in IPF tissue. Interestingly, all tissues and the IPF ECM hydrogel required 4 Maxwell element models to describe their relaxation, whereas control and COPD GOLD IV dECM hydrogels required 3, further suggesting that ECM composition also plays a role in viscoelasticity.",

All the LLCT measurements were recorded at RT and thus may not fully reflect the biomechanical properties of the lung in vivo.",
