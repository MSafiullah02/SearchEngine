Recent studies have suggested that the virus binds to the ACE2 receptor on the surface of the host cell using spike proteins, and explored the binary interaction of these two partners [8,23]. In this work, we focused our analysis on the interface residues to get insight into four main subjects: (1) The architecture of the spike protein interface and whether its evolution in many isolates supports an increase in affinity toward the ACE2 receptor; (2) How the affinity of SARS-COV-2-RBD and SARS-CoV-RBD toward different ACE2 homologous proteins from different species is dictated by a divergent interface sequences (3); A comparison of the interaction hotspots between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; and finally, (4) whether any of the studied ACE2 variants may show a different binding property compared to the reference allele. To tackle these questions we used multi-scale modelling approaches in combination with sequence and phylogenetic analysis.",

The General Time Reversible (GTR) model was chosen as the best fitting model for nucleotide substitution with discrete Gamma distribution (+G) with 5 rate categories. For the RBD sequences, the best substitution model for maximum likelihood (ML) calculation was selected using a model selection tool implemented on MEGA 6 software based on the lowest BIC score. Therefore, the WAG model [20] using a discrete Gamma distribution (+G) with 5 rate categories has been selected.",

The construction of the complex applies a comparative-based approach that uses a template structure in which both partners (ligand and receptor) are closely related to those in the target system respectively. In our study, we only modeled the interaction of the RBD which was shown to be implicated in the physical interaction with ACE2 (Fig. 2\nA). The lowest sequence identity of the modeled spike proteins as well as those of any of the orthologous ACE2 sequences (Human, civet, bat, pig, rat, chicken and snake) do not fall below 63% toward their respective templates. At such values of sequence identities it is expected that the template and the target complexes share the same binding mode [6].",

While the binding energy score falls in the boundary limit of the incertitude margin for PRODIGY calculation (section 2, Supplementary material 2), the differences in the scores calculated by FoldX and MM-GBSA are not. Therefore we consider that such differences in energies compared to SARS-CoV-2 are consistent between the three methods.

All these amino acids form three patches of interaction spread along the linear interface segment (Fig. 3C): two from the N and C termini and one central. T500 establishes two hydrogen bonds using its side and main chains with Y41 and N330 of hACE2. N501 forms another hydrogen bond with ACE2 residue K353 buried within the interface.

Our results showed that if ACE2 is the only route for the infection in humans, variants interacting physically with RBD are not likely to disrupt the formation of the complex and would have a marginal effect on the affinity. Therefore, it is unlikely that any form of resistance to the virus, related to the ACE2 gene, exists. However, this analysis merits to be investigated in depth in different ethnic groups for a better assessment of the contribution of genetic variability in host-pathogen interaction. The similar values of binding energy scores with different ACE2 orthologues suggest that the ability of binding to different ACE2 orthologous is preserved in many species either for SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV. Therefore, the transition to the zoonotic form is trivial if that depends only on ACE2 as the primary route to the infection in both the intermediate and the final host. However, we know that such a process is very complex since it requires many protein-protein interactions to acquire the specific capacity of infecting and replicating in the host cells [18]. Consequently, it makes sense to assume that many other types of receptors or co-receptors may be critical to determine the capacity of crossing the species barrier. This has been already suggested for SARS-CoV [1] and similarly, SARS-CoV-2 may show the same feature. Moreover, our results show that the significant overlap of glycosylation sites with the protein-protein interface implies a likely interaction of SARS-CoV-2 progenitors with receptors other than ACE2. Finally, recent transcriptomic profiling has suggested the possibility of multiple route infections via the interaction of many human receptors for SARS-CoV-2 [11].",

The use of RBD sequences, however, places the virus in a clade that comprises SARS-CoV related homologs including isolates from Bat and Civet. The clade swapping as seen in Fig. 1A, seems also to occur for RaTG13 and Rm1 isolated from bat. This is expected as the use of different phylogenetic markers may considerably affect the topology of the tree. However, The significant divergence in the interfaces segments as a key molecular element contributing to the determination of the tree topology has driven our work toward studying their impact on the interaction with hACE2. The binding of the spike glycoprotein to ACE2 receptor requires a certain level of affinity. In the case where the RBD evolves from an ancestral form closer to that of Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21, we expected a decrease of the binding energy scores through the evolution process following incremental changes in the RBD. In such a scenario, we presume that there are other intermediary forms of coronavirus that describe such variation of the binding energy score to reach a level where the pathogen can infect humans with high affinity toward hACE2. On the other hand, our results show that the binding energy score and the interface sequence of SARS-CoV-2 RBD are closer to SARS-CoV related isolates (either from Human or other species). Therefore a recombination event involving the spike protein that might have occurred between SARS-CoV and an ancestral form of the current SARS-CoV-2 virus might be also possible. This will allow for the virus to acquire a minimum set of residues for the interaction with hACE2. The recombination in the spike protein gene has been previously suggested by Wei et al. in their phylogenetic analysis [4]. Thereafter, incremental changes in the binding interface segment will occur in order to reach a better affinity toward the receptor. One of these changes may involve P499 residue which substitution to threonine seems to drastically destabilize the interface segment and has a distant effect. Moreover, the decomposition of the interaction energy showed that 5 out of 6 hotspot amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 have their equivalent in SARS-CoV including N501. Contrary to what Wan et al. [17] have stated, the single mutation N501T does not seem to enhance the affinity. Rather, the residue Q493 might be responsible for such higher affinity due to a better satisfaction of the Van der Waals by the longer polar side chain of asparagine. Indeed, when we made the same analysis while mutating Q493 to N493, the favorable contribution decreases from \u22122.55 kcal/mol to a non significant value of \u22120.01 kcal/mol, thus supporting our claim.",

This suggests that the molecular elements required for the binding with the receptor might also be involved in the interaction with other orthologous forms of ACE2 and that these elements are not optimized specifically for the human form. Therefore, it is unlikely that the interface of RBD from SARS-CoV-2 is a result of human intervention via genetic engineering aiming to increase the affinity toward ACE2. For example, residue E484 contributes unfavorably to the binding energy with 2.24 kcal/mol due to an electrostatic repulsion with E75 from hACE2. This residue is an apparent choice for engineering a protein-protein complex with high affinity by substituting E484 with a polar residue. It is, however, noteworthy that the lesser homogeneity of the nodes of SARS-CoV-2 group, in comparison to SARS-CoV, may suggest a higher tolerance for the mutation of the new virus which would allow it to cross the species barrier more easily and to efficiently optimize the interaction in the host.",
