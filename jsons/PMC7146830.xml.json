No single antiviral drug has ever been licensed for clinical use against entero- or rhinovirus infections. The most extensively studied for its potential against enteroviruses has been pleconaril. This compound binds to a hydrophobic pocket beneath the \u201ccanyon floor\u201d of the VP1 capsid protein of picornaviruses,93 thereby \u201cfreezing\u201d the viral capsid and preventing its dissociation (uncoating) from the viral RNA genome. The clinical efficacy of pleconaril has been evaluated in experimentally induced enterovirus (Coxsackie A21) respiratory infections in adult volunteers145 and, on a compassionate basis, against potentially life-threatening enterovirus infections.142 Pleconaril has also been shown to reduce the duration and severity of picornavirus-associated viral respiratory illnesses in adolescents and adults.66., 67. Pleconaril would also shorten the course of enteroviral meningitis (as compared to placebo recipients), albeit only modestly in patients with more severe disease.37\n",

A more pronounced inhibitory effect on Coxsackie B3 virus-induced myocarditis, accompanied by a marked reduction in the virus titers in the heart, was obtained with the interferon inducer poly(I)\u22c5poly(C) and poly(I)\u22c5poly(C12U) (also known as Ampligen), and to a lesser extent with (pegylated) interferon-\u03b12b.125 Combination of an inhibitor of viral replication (such as Ampligen) with an immunosuppressant (such as MPA mofetil) could be an ideal treatment strategy for viral myocarditis, whether due to Coxsackie B or other viruses.

CyP B is a functional regulator of the HCV RNA polymerase.185 Cyclosporin A which interacts with CyP B inhibits HCV replication in vitro.185 We have recently demonstrated that the non-immunosuppressive cyclosporin DEBIO-025 is even 10-fold more potent an inhibitor of HCV replication.127 DEBIO-025 proved also additive to slightly synergistic when combined with interferon-\u03b12a, and at concentrations of 0.5 and 1 \u03bcg/ml was able to clear the cells from their HCV replicon within three to four passages, whereas treatment with cyclosporin A at the same concentrations for seven consecutive passages did not result in clearance of the HCV replicon.127 DEBIO-025 may form an attractive new option for the therapy of HCV infections, particularly in HCV/HIV co-infected patients,127 and the clinical studies with DEBIO-025 have been recently initiated.",

Several attempts have been, and are still being, made to develop an effective vaccine for rotavirus infections. Current treatment for rotavirus diarrhoea is mainly based on the administration of fluids to prevent dehydration. There are no serious attempts to develop an antiviral drug for this disease, although it is noteworthy that the replication of reo- (and rota)viruses is exquisitely sensitive to SAH hydrolase inhibitors such as 3-deazaneplanocin A.32 Also, small interfering RNA (siRNA) corresponding to the VP4 gene has been shown to efficiently inhibit the synthesis of this protein, and to reduce the yield of viral progeny in virus-infected cells.35\n",

Antiviral agents may also exert their antiviral effects through an interaction with cellular targets such as IMP dehydrogenase (ribavirin) and SAH hydrolase (3-deazaneplanocin A). The latter enzymes are essential for viral RNA synthesis (through the supply of GTP) and viral mRNA maturation (through 5\u2032-capping), respectively. Finally, interferons (now generally provided in their pegylated form) may be advocated in the therapy of those viral infections (actually, HBV and HCV; prospectively, Coxsackie B, SARS, \u2026) that, as yet, cannot be sufficiently curbed by other therapeutic measures.",
