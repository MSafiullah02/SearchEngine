On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and by March 11, 2020 , it was officially declared a pandemic. 1 As of April 5, 2020, the United States has 330,891 reported cases and 8,910 deaths in total, with 64,966 of those cases and 2,472 deaths attributed to New York City alone. 2, 3 The rapid progression of COVID infection rates has stimulated the international implementation of social distancing practices and temporary cessation of all nonessential businesses. Because COVID is primarily transmitted through respira-tory droplets and close contact, strict adherence to social distancing procedures is critical to limit the spread of infection and mitigate the foreseen impact on healthcare systems. 4 Within the healthcare setting, adaptations to regular clinical procedures are necessary to reduce the risk of infection in patients, families, and healthcare providers alike while balancing the risks and benefits of delaying or altering typical patient care.",

In Italy, front-line healthcare workers were disproportionately prone to COVID infection, and often contracted the most severe form of the disease. The risk specifically to surgeons is that the virus is transmitted primarily through aerosolsdroplets containing the virus. This puts anesthesiologists at particular risk during intubation and extubation, but the rest of the team is also susceptible. The risk of aerosolgenerating procedures has led centers to minimize personnel in the operating room. Orthopaedics often requires the use of power tools with aerosolization of material putting the team at further increased risk in comparison to other surgical procedures. Although blood is not the preferred route of the virus, research supports the idea that COVID is an opportunistic invader. Consequently, blood donors in Wuhan are now screened for the virus.",

However, the risks of deferring treatment must be weighed against the risks of continuing treatment as usual during the COVID crisis. A unique feature of pediatric care is the number of caregivers and/or family members who typically accompany an infant or child to a clinic appointment. It is common to see two or three caregivers in clinic along with the child. In addition, there are typically a minimum of four healthcare workers in contact with the family during the visit. Each family member present could potentially be an asymptomatic or presymptomatic vector for viral transmission, increasing the chance of spreading infection to healthcare workers or other patients and families. Eliminating as many of these visits as possible during the peak of the pandemic can greatly reduce the chances of viral spread.",

Although initial impressions of COVID have been that children are not as susceptible to infection, a recent retrospective review of the epidemiology of pediatric cases in China suggested that infants were more susceptible to the severe infection than older children, with 10.6% of cases severe or critical in infants younger than one year of age. 20 For a condition such as DDH, most children coming to the orthopaedic clinic for DDH are younger than one year of age; therefore, these patients represent a potentially vulnerable cohort during this time. Children with cerebral palsy also represent a particularly at-risk and open reduction even in older infants seen within IHDR can allay some of these concerns.",

After careful consideration of the risk/benefit ratio of delaying treatment to reduce odds of infection, BCCH is choosing to postpone assessment and treatment of DDH for the next 2 to 4 months. There is evidence to suggest that good outcomes for DDH can still be achieved, by either conservative or surgical approaches, beyond 4 months of age. Even when treated by conservative methods, infants require frequent hospital visits throughout their treatment course. Given the emerging evidence showing infants may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, this would put them at increased risk.",
