This explains the absence of information about the contribution of ARVI with gastrointestinal syndrome in the structure of infection pathology in general and among ARVI. At the same time, a number of reports about GIT disorders in children with RT infections and catarrhal symptoms in the rhinopharynx appeared in the 1960s [4, 10] .

Thus, combined involvement of RT and GIT is recorded in every 4th-5th patient admitted to the hospital with ARVI, primarily in children of the fi rst 3 years of life. Viral infection (adeno-, rota-, and coronavirus in the form of mono-and mixed variants) plays the leading role in the etiology of this symptom complex. The therapy should be complex and depend on the leading syndrome; IFN inductor AP can be included. ",
