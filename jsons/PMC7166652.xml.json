Early studies suggested that nasal aspirates were superior to swab specimens [Lieberman et al., 2009]; however, this might not be true for all respiratory viruses and all detection methods.

However, it is used rarely for the detection of respiratory viruses using traditional methods such as the viral antigen test or viral culture. With nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), sputum samples have been used for the detection of respiratory pathogens. Currently, few data comparing the diagnostic yields of nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples for respiratory virus detection have been published. The present study found that the overall detection rate from sputum samples in adults was significantly higher than from nasopharyngeal swabs using multiplex real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. This finding is consistent with the result of a previous study that sputum samples showed higher diagnostic yields than nose\u2013throat swabs in adults using RT\u2010PCR [Falsey et al., 2012].",

Generally, it is hard to compare detection rates of respiratory viruses because of differences in testing methods, specimen types (upper or lower airways, swabs or washes, nose or throat, flocked or regular swabs), and types of transport media. Our results are still relatively high compared with those of other reports [Lieberman et al., 2009; Falsey et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2012]. These differences can be explained by several factors. First, the Anyplex II RV16 Detection kit is a multiplex real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay that can detect simultaneously 16 different types of viruses. This kit offers higher sensitivity in the detection of traditionally diagnosed respiratory viruses in addition to the ability to detect newly recognized viruses, such as HBoV, PIV 1, and HRV C. Second, nasopharyngeal samplings were obtained using flocked swabs in the present study, and it is known that flocked swabs can collect significantly more epithelial cells, thus providing higher positive rates than conventional swabs [Loens et al., 2009].

A prior study compared the yields of paired nose\u2013throat swabs and endotracheal aspirates for the detection of influenza virus using RT\u2010PCR. Among the 22 influenza A patients that were admitted to adult ICUs, this group detected influenza viruses from 14 (63.6%) nose\u2013throat swabs and 20 (90.9%) endotracheal aspirates [Roa et al., 2012].

In this study, co\u2010infections in sputum samples were more common than those in nasopharyngeal swabs (19% vs. 6%).

Therefore, pre\u2010treatment of sputum samples is needed, but no standardized pre\u2010treatment procedure is available for viral detection. Dithiothreitol or NALC (N\u2010acetyl\u2010L\u2010cysteine)\u2010NaOH, which are used generally for the digestion of sputum in mycobacterial laboratories, may cause substantial loss of RNA due to the repetitive washing and pipetting steps in the procedures [Desjardin et al., 1996; Xiang et al., 2001]. In this study, sputum samples were diluted with PBS and mixed by vortexing, and the volume and time depended on the sputum viscosity. This procedure was sufficient for sputum homogenization. Another problem is that NAAT inhibitors in respiratory specimens may affect the sensitivity of the assay or lead to false\u2010negative results. Inhibition of the amplification of the internal control was noted in 15% of the sputum samples, which is a high proportion compared with that of nasopharyngeal swabs (3%). A widely applied method for the removal of PCR inhibitors is sample dilution, which may lead to decreased inhibitors. In the present study, samples that showed invalid PCR results were diluted with twice the initial volume of PBS and re\u2010extracted manually. In the author's experience, thoroughly mixing and homogenization of sputum samples might be important to obtain valid results.

            "text": "In conclusion, the detection rates of respiratory viruses from sputum samples are significantly higher than those from nasopharyngeal swabs in adults using multiple real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. However, the use of sputum is limited to patients who can produce sputum. These findings suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of respiratory viruses by NAATs in patients who produce sputum. Further studies are needed to establish standardized RNA extraction methods from sputum samples.",
