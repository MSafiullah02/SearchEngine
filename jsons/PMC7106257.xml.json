With support of the WHO, authorities in affected regions implemented epidemiologic surveillance and adherence to infection-control procedures, including patient isolation and quarantine for contacts, which helped to contain the SARS outbreak by mid-July 2003. However, there were a total of 8098 SARS cases and 774 associated deaths.",

This novel CoV has satisfied Koch\u2019s postulates for causation by its consistent isolation from SARS patients, viral isolation, reproduction of disease in non-human primates after inoculation and the presence of specific antibody response against the virus in both patients and experimentally infected primates8. All of these remarkable findings were accomplished within a few months of the issue of the WHO global alert on SARS, testifying to the rapid response of the collaboration of the international research effort to deal with such emerging pandemics. The origin of SARS remains uncertain despite closely related CoVs that were recovered from civet cats and other animals in Guangdong Province, suggesting the SARS-CoV could have originated from such animals and implicating SARS as a zoonotic disease.9 Other members of the CoV family can cause fatal diseases in poultry and laboratory rodents. The two previously known human CoVs cause only mild upper respiratory infections.10\n",

At present, the treatment is largely empirical and therefore controversial, ranging from supportive therapy without intervention to a combination of antivirals and steroids. A recent report on an open trial of a combination of a protease inhibitor and a nucleoside analogue against a historical control suggests a favourable clinical response using lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin.13 However, controversy remains as no controlled studies have been undertaken, and there is a need to set up international clinical trial networks to develop and perform clinical protocols should SARS reappear.",

A soluble form of the ACE2 may slow viral replication in an infected individual.17 Recently, a human monoclonal antibody 80R, against S1 domain of the SARS CoV, has been developed that can potently neutralise SARS CoV infection and efficiently inhibit syncytia formation through blocking of receptor binding.20 This monoclonal antibody can be used as an immediate treatment strategy for emergency prophylaxis and treatment of SARS, while the more time-consuming development of vaccines and new drugs is underway.",

The mechanism through which the SARS CoV precipitates such lymphopaenia so rapidly is unclear but could be related to immunologic trigger of apoptosis of uninfected lymphocytes. Elucidation of the underlying mechanism may help design treatment strategies.",

SARS CoV S protein, expressed by attenuated vaccinia virus, has been shown to immunise mice protectively.30 Similarly, a DNA vaccine encoding the SARS CoV S protein can induce T cell and neutralising antibody responses, as well as protective immunity, in a mouse model.31 Viral replication can be reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these S plasmid DNA expression vectors and protection is mediated by a humoral but not a T-cell-dependent immune mechanism.31\n",
