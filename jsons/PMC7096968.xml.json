Aliquots of 10 \u03bcL of culture media supernatants and standard reagents were evenly coated onto Ni (358 \u00b0C) Curie-point wires and evaporated to dryness by rotation. The wires were held in quartz sample tubes and inserted into the mass spectrometer via a direct probe inlet. The temperature rise time of Ni wires is on the order of 210 ms. The equilibrium temperature of 358 \u00b0C was held for 9.9 s. The ion source was operated in the positive electron ionization (EI) mode with an energy of 70 eV. The ion source and transfer line (quartz tube 5 cm long and 1.2 mm i.d.) temperatures were maintained at 210 \u00b0C.

Biomolecules, regardless of their origin, are thermally degraded to the same degree. Therefore, pyrolysis of the virus is expected to produce molecular fragments of similar nominal masses as produced by the culture medium. Because the two mass spectra in Figure 1a, b are nearly identical it is presumed that the contribution of the virus is negligible, otherwise a noticeable difference in peak ratios between the two spectra would be visibly apparent. This result was not unexpected, considering that the yield of viral mass from infected cells is small (\u223c0.1% w/w) relative to the overall masses of the host cells and growth media. The chemical signal originating from the cell culture media dominates the spectra of the unpurified viral media overwhelming the peaks generated from the viruses. This result is consistent with the previous study by Tas et al. [16] which concluded that purification appeared to be a prerequisite for reliable classification of the virus.",

Each datapoint, on the score plot, represents a mass spectrum from either the complete growth media or one of its constituents.

The closer the distance between two datapoints, the more these two mass spectra resemble one another.

Distinguishing cholesterol ions include its molecular ion at m/z 386 and fragments ions at m/z 368, 353, 326, 301, 274, and 213.

The mass to charge ratio values for the FFAs detected are given in Table 2. The appearance of an intense linoleic peak in the horse serum spectrum and its almost complete absence in the spectrum of the fetal bovine serum agrees with reported concentrations of this acid in the two blood sera [26]. The total concentration of FFAs in horse serum and fetal bovine serum are 0.49 and 0.35 \u03bcmol/mL, respectively [26].

The lower pyrolysis temperature helped reduce the contribution made by other components less volatile than the lipid compounds. Meuzelaar and Huff [27] reported the detection of cholesterol and long chain aliphatic fragments in human white blood cells using 358 \u00b0C Curie-point wires. Their spectra were generated by pyrolyzing the sample on the wire, removing the spent wire from the quartz sample tube, and then reheating the condensate that formed on the inside of the quartz sample tube. The spectra displayed in this report were all generated by direct pyrolysis from the Curie-point wire. This technique is simple in practice and unique because underivatized fatty acids are rarely employed for taxonomic studies [28].",

To substantiate this proposal, an extensive examination of aerosolized viral media using the field-portable unit will need to be conducted in the near future. As part of this study, limits of detection and potential interferents such as diesel fuels, cleaning reagents, pesticides, automobile exhausts, and other common background constituents will also need to be evaluated.
