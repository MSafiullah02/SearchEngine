            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), has caused serious worldwide epidemics. Because it is highly contagious, potentially life-threatening, and spreads rapidly, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization continue to closely monitor the SARS situation to strictly control its spread. Because it is an airborne disease, and is easily transmitted from person to person, several measures have been taken to prevent the recurrence of another SARS outbreak. Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2002 and 2003, there is growing demand for diagnostic tools for early, accurate, and safe laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV. Thus, the development and evaluation of specific and early detection of SARS-CoV may contribute to its risk management in the future. The 3 major diagnostic methods currently available are (i) viral RNA detection using real-time reverse-transcription PCR (Yam et al., 2003; Jiang et al., 2004; Poon et al., 2004), (ii) antibody detection (Chan et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005), and (iii) antigen detection (Che et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005). The most predominant SARS-CoV-derived protein throughout the infection is the nucleocapsid protein (NP) due to the comparatively high levels of mRNA expressed upon infection (Hiscox et al., 1995). The NP is also reported to be high in humans infected with SARS-CoV. The NP of SARS-CoV exhibits low homology with other members of the coronavirus family (Marra et al., 2003). This unique feature makes it a suitable candidate for developing a monoclonal antibody (mAb) for ultrasensitive SARS diagnostics. It has also been demonstrated that there is a significant amount of circulating shed NP antigen in serum samples from infected patients ranging from 100 pg/mL to 3.2 ng/mL. Detection of the NP antigen by ELISA was peaked at d 6 to 10 with 71% of patients being positive for the antigen (Che et al., 2004). It has also been reported that the NP was detectable from SARS-CoV-infected patients in other body fluids, such as nasopharyngeal aspirate, urine, and fecal samples, collected between d 2 to 33 after the onset of symptoms (Peiris et al., 2003; Lau et al., 2004).",

During the first 10 d after disease onset, the NP was detected in 90% of the patients compared with the detection of IgG and RNA (Li et al., 2005). The detection rate of the NP between d 11 to 15 of the disease was significantly higher than those of anti-SARS-CoV IgG and RNA. Hence, there is a need for the development of sensitive and highly specific diagnostic kits that can be used in the field. Traditionally, polyclonal antibodies (pAb) and mAb are used for various clinical diagnostic applications. Highly pathogenic strains of bacteria and viruses can be detected by exploiting the pAb technique for its higher sensitivity due to its ability to bind to multiple epitopes.",

Avian pAb raised against different targets produces chicken IgY in abundant amounts compared with the amount in mammalian and rodent species. Chicken IgY can also be obtained by noninvasive methods by the collection of antibodies in the egg yolks of hens hyperimmunized with the specific antigen. Chicken IgY is structurally similar to mammalian IgG in its affinity, but its molecular weight (\u02dc180 kDa) is comparatively higher than IgG (\u02dc150 kDa). This is due to its additional heavy-chain constant domain and carbohydrate chains. It has been demonstrated in the literature that IgY has been used in several applications, which includes quantitation of tumor biomarkers (Xiao et al., 2008) as immunotherapeutic agents against Candida albicans (Ibrahim et al., 2008), and detection of E. coli O157 (Sunwoo et al., 2006) and Salmonella (Terzolo et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2002).",

Specific activities of IgY from chickens immunized with SARS-CoV NP antigen were monitored by indirect ELISA during the period of immunization (Figure 1\n). The IgY titer estimated by indirect ELISA indicated a primary response characterized by slight increase in its activity. Following a booster injection, a rapid secondary response was shown with high SARS-CoV NP specific IgY activity at a peak of 8 wk. As a result, a high antigen-binding specificity of anti-SARS-CoV NP IgY could be obtained from the egg yolks collected from immunized eggs during the immunization period of 6 to 10 wk. The WSF of the egg yolk was purified and analyzed for purity and specificity to the NP antigen. The crude egg yolk IgY WSF showed only 38% purity (data not shown), indicating that the rest of the fraction was contaminated with alpha and gamma livetins, lipoproteins, and fatty acid molecules. The crude IgY WSF from the immunized hens were further purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and subsequently by Sephacryl S-300 gel chromatography. The purified IgY was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, which revealed that the purity of IgY was greater than 95% (Figure 2A\n). The specificity of the immune IgY was determined by Western blotting, which demonstrated that IgY strongly binds to the NP in the Western blot (Figure 2C). There was no cross reaction with other viral proteins, Dengue virus, or Ebola virus (data not shown).",
