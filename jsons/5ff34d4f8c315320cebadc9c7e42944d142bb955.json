I had a pretty solid outline for a column in which I would have delved into the global safety literature and then explored the idea of informed consent in maternity care. I would have explored the idea of choice and what it means in terms of planned place of birth, specifically within our unique, U.S. health care system.",

By the time you read this column in another 6 weeks, I cannot begin to speculate about what our lives will look like-what your lives, as health care providers, will look like. (Thank you, so much, for doing what you do.) As an epidemiologist, I have spent the last 2 weeks answering questions from my friends and family; no doubt this will continue as we are bombarded by daily news-some true, much of it not-about the novel coronavirus. My children are out of school at least through the end of April, and my university has announced that all classes for spring quarter will be held online only. Hopefully these and other social distancing measures will allow our health care system to keep up with the sudden, increased demand for critical care. Perhaps, by early May when this is published, we will be beginning to return to our normal lives. As I write, China is just beginning to relax some of their mandatory social isolation measures following several days of no observed communitytransmitted cases. Hopefully, this is where the United States will be in 6 weeks. Although, of course, it is entirely possible that China will be forced to return to mandatory social distancing in the meantime and that we would be wise to follow suit.",

Thus far, it seems that pregnant women and children are not at high risk of severe disease given SARS-CoV-2 infection (so few data are available that I cannot provide citations). However, like so many other things about our current situation, we just don't yet know. What we do know is that even under best case scenarios, in the next few weeks our hospitals will likely exceed their capacities, and our health care workforce will shrink as physicians and nurses become infected themselves. Hopefully, the excess demand is not too high. Regardless, as a pregnant woman would you want to have your baby in a hospital in which most other patients have COVID-19? In which the medical staff are stretched even more thin than normal? In which there might not even be a bed for you? Unfortunately, most women who are due to give birth in the next several weeks will not have a choice.",

(2019) explored factors that might conceivably be associated with anorectal infections with chlamydia or gonorrhea in women: concurrent urogenital infection, concurrent oropharyngeal infection, and anal intercourse. As expected, more women overall had C. trachomatis infections than N. gonorrhea infections; however, as all studies were conducted at sexually transmitted infection clinics, the prevalences of both were quite high in the study populations.",

The authors concluded, \"anorectal NG [N. gonorrhea] was substantially more associated with urogenital and oropharyngeal detection than was anorectal CT [C. trachomatis].

Less obvious are the potential mechanisms for anorectal infection with either of these organisms in women who deny anal intercourse. Lau et al. (2019) speculated that urogenital infections may be transmitted to anorectal infections via toileting and that oropharyngeal infections may be transmitted to anorectal infections via the gastrointestinal tract. Regardless of mechanism, these co-infections are more common among women with gonorrhea than women with chlamydia.",

It is easy to imagine a scenario in which cheiloplasty followed by surgeonrecommended spoon or cup feeding leads to early weaning, particularly in settings in which women do not have access to high-quality breast pumps. The literature summarized by Matsunaka et al. (2019) does not allow us to draw definitive conclusions about preferred feeding method following cleft lip repair, at least in terms of wound healing. However, this also means that cup or spoon feeding has not been shown to be beneficial. Until such time as larger, more definitive studies are conducted, it seems that the known benefits of avoiding early weaning likely outweigh the unproven claims of increased wound dehiscence if breastfeeding continues.",
