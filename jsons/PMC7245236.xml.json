This viral outbreak has raised serious concerns among the public and patients with health conditions. In the medical community, Rheumatologists are particularly concerned because their patients represent a population of autoimmune rheumatic disorders who are mostly on immunosuppressive agents and are susceptible to infection. While much has been learnt on COVID-19 in general, little is known of COVID-19 severity and outcomes in patients with rheumatic diseases (RD). Herein, in conjunction with the literature review, we report a case series of patients with RD, who were infected with COVID-19",

These patients had underlying RD on disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) prior to developing COVID-19. In our patients, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was made based on clinical grounds and by polymerase chain reaction of samples from nasopharyngeal swabs. In addition, a literature search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted between December 2019 and May 2, 2020 using the terms: \u201cCOVID-19\u201d and \u201crheumatic disease\u201d or \u201cbiologic\u201d. The search process and result are depicted in PRISMA (Figure 1\n). English language articles that reported single case or case series of COVID-19 in RD were reviewed. Relevant information such as demographic, clinical, therapeutic data, and outcomes of these patients were gathered from the literature. Other relevant literature regarding the virus (SARS), immune response, and cytokine storm, were also searched between 1990 and May 2, 2020. Descriptive statistics was used.",

All 4 patients had elevated acute phase reactants, 2 patients had mild COVID-19 with lymphopenia, and 2 patients had severe infection with normal lymphocyte counts and high levels of interleukin (IL)-6. None of the patients exhibited an exacerbation of their underlying RDs. The lupus patient had normal complement levels and negative anti-double stranded DNA antibodies.

Through the literature search, we identified 9 separate studies of COVID-19 in RD, including 4 single cases (1, 2, 3, 4) and 5 case series (5, 6, 7, 8, 9). These studies involved 197 cases of various inflammatory RD. Most patients were on conventional and/or biologic DMARDs. The most frequently used DMARDs were tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 inhibitors among the patients. There were 2 cases of RD on rituximab, 1 with GPA having severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation; the patient received HCQ and lopinavir/ritonavir. The other patient with RA had clinical improvement after receiving HCQ/azithromycin/lopinavir-ritonavir/tocilizumab, and supplemental oxygen. There were 2 tocilizumab users including 1 Systemic Sclerosis patient who was treated at home and 1 RA patient on MTX and HCQ requiring supplemental oxygen, who was discharged 6 days later. Of the 6 secukinumab users, 5 were treated at home, while 1 required hospitalization but was discharged 3 days later. Among the 17 SLE cases, there were 7 ICU admissions and 2 deaths. All patients were on HCQ and 7 were on immunosuppressive agents. The authors did not specify the medications used among those ICU or severe patients (7). In the Global Rheumatology Alliance registry of 110 cases, there were 19 SLE cases; however, their disease severity and DMARD use was not specified. In addition, there were 39 hospitalized patients and 9 deaths (9). In the New York University Langone Health group study of 59 confirmed cases of COVID-19, there were 45 outpatients and 14 inpatients. Of the hospitalized patients, there were 1 ICU patient who had hypertension, BMI >30, mild psoriatic arthritis, and was on MTX prior to infection and 1 death who had coronary artery disease, BMI>40, and severe psoriasis. The remaining patients had mild viral disease course. Based on the total number of the literature cases plus our 4 cases, we estimated the mortality was 5.9% (12/201) among COVID-19 patients with RD.",

            "text": "SARS CoV2 is an enveloped RNA virus that consists of four primary structural proteins including a spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) glycoprotein, membrane (M)glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein, along with several accessory proteins (11). The S glycoprotein binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor on cell membranes, followed by fusion of the viral membrane and host cell (12, 13). The cellular serine protease, TMPRSS2, is also required to properly process the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and facilitate host cell entry (14). The virus entry initially triggers the innate immune response, where Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRR) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP). The PAMP may be nucleic acids, glycoproteins, lipoproteins and other small molecules that are found in the structural components of viruses. This in turn induces a release of proinflammatory cytokines, which activate transcription factors and JAK-STAT pathways, further releasing a number of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b1, TNF\u03b1, other cytokines and chemokines. This hyperinflammation can lead to cytokine storm (15). The virus also activates the adaptive immune response, where activated Th1 cells can stimulate cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to destroy virally infected cells. Meanwhile, Th1 cells activate and stimulate B cells to produce antigen-specific antibodies (16, 17). Despite this defense mechanism, like the 2002 SARS-CoV, these viruses have the ability to evade the immune system (18, 19), thus making the development of effective drugs more challenging.",

            "text": "It is reported that a subgroup of COVID-19 patients(15%) developed severe infection and life-threatening complications, in which hyperinflammatory responses or cytokine storm are involved (20). Cytokine storm is defined as a syndrome of excessive immune activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes and macrophages with hypersecretion of proinflammatory cytokines. These mediators include interleukin IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1 (21, 22, 23). Huang et al. described a similar cytokine profile in their patients with COVID-19 and cytokine storm (24). Th17 cells and IL-17 are also involved in the cytokine storm response (25). With what has been learned on the role of cytokine storm, it will be important to use that information to guide and formulate a therapeutic strategy for severe COVID-19 patients. Henderson et. al recently suggested to monitor COVID-19 patients as early as possible with such biometrics as cytopenia, fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase, hepatic transaminases, elevated ferritin, CD25, and IL-6 for cytokine storm. They also summarized treatment regimens for cytokine storm in general and their potential utility in severe COVID-19 (26). Among them are IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 inhibitors which have been successfully used in alleviating cytokine storm secondary to certain systemic inflammatory RDs (27, 28, 29, 30). Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, has been studied in COVID-19 patients with some success. A study of severe to critical COVID-19 patients in China has shown improved outcome in 15 out of 20 patients (31). Preliminary data from a French study also has provided promising results (32), An Italian prospective open, single-arm, multicenter study of 63 hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 has demonstrated improvement in respiratory and laboratory parameters (33). According to the literature data in our study, two RD patients on tocilizumab developed mild COVID-19 infection, supporting the positive role of IL-6 antagonist. There are still several ongoing clinical trials to investigate the potential role of interleukin antagonists, particularly IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, in the treatment of severe COVID-19 (34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40). JAK inhibitors which indirectly block IL-6 are also being studied in treating this infection (41, 42, 43, 44). For a full consideration of using anti-cytokine storm to treat this viral disease, other agents to inhibit the inflammatory mediators may need to be explored. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate whether other biologics may have influences in the clinical course of the COVID-19 related respiratory and other complications.",

Similarly, in the published studies 7 cases were on etanercept and developed mild symptoms, although some patients were hospitalized. Etanercept is a TNF\u03b1 receptor II antagonist which is known to be associated with a high rate of infections. Unexpectedly, it did not lead to severe COVID-19 in our patient and literature cases, perhaps due to its inhibition of TNF\u03b1, a cytokine involved in the viral disease cytokine storm. According to the literature data in our study, TNF\u03b1 inhibitors including etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab were more frequently used in RD patients, and they seemed to have less severity of the viral illness. TNF\u03b1 has been reported to be present in the blood and disease tissues of patients with COVID-19 (45). Additionally, it is possible that pretreatment with etanercept could have resulted in a blunted IL-6 response indirectly. In an in vitro study, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 were up-regulated by the recombinant S protein of the 2002 SARS-CoV suggesting that TNF\u03b1 or IL-6 antagonists may potentially reduce the cytokine storm in COVID-19 and its related lung damage (46). These data together suggest that TNF\u03b1 antagonist may be considered as a treatment strategy for severe COVID-19 in the future.",

While some studies showed benefit (47), other studies produced mixed results. Chowdhury et. al surveyed recent literature on clinical trials involving HCQ and Chloroquine. They found 5/7 completed clinical trials showed favorable outcomes, whereas 2/7 trials showed no change compared to control (61). In a French case series of lupus, which was included in our study, HCQ was found to have variable outcomes in the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications (7). Another observational study at the Veterans Affairs hospital showed no benefit of HCQ in severe COVID-19 (62). Although HCQ has been used to treat COVID-19, its efficacy will need to be confirmed by the results of the ongoing clinical trials.",

This drug may have reduced her humoral immune response leading to a more severe disease course. In a prospective study of 200 subjects infected with human coronaviruses, neutralizing antibody has been shown to play a protective role by limiting the infection at a later phase and to prevent re\u2010infection in the future (63). SARS-CoV infection induces IgG production against N protein, which can be detected in serum as early as day 4 after the onset of disease and with most patients being seroconverted by day 14 (64, 65). Hence, B-cell depletion with Rituximab may have altered the antibody response making the patient more vulnerable to the infection. Additionally, SARS-CoV has also been shown to decrease T lymphocytes in 65 patients. Glucocorticoid administration contributed to further decrease in lymphocyte counts (66). As a result, these together hinder the host's ability to adequately respond to the infection. Similarly, the published case of GPA on Rituximab in the current study also developed severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (2). Taken together, these findings suggest that pretreatment with Rituximab, particularly with glucocorticoids, could contribute to a more severe COVID-19 infection and poor outcome.",
