This was the first complete, well-researched, description of the circulatory system including the pulmonary and the systemic circulation.

Harvey calculated cardiac output and demonstrated that it was impossible that the liver could possibly produce the volume of blood required as had been previously thought. This bold insight set the stage for new ideas surrounding treatment\nfor hemorrhage.",

Lower bled a dog\nto the point of death and then saved the animal with a whole blood transfusion from another larger dog. In 1667, blood was first transfused from animal to man by Jean Baptiste Denis and Lower. It must be noted that the transfusion of blood from a lamb into man was not as a treatment for hemorrhage but instead for \u201cmadness.\u201d After much medical and theological debate, the practice of transfusion was banned by the French and later the Pope.

Whole blood is the only agent that prepares casualties for surgery and decreases mortality by reducing infection. Inadequate resuscitation\nwith whole blood resulted in organ damage. There was a widespread misconception by US military medical leadership that plasma was as effective as whole blood [36]. Churchill, incensed by the US Surgeon Generals\u2019 position on blood products, briefed a New York Times reporter with the aim of publicizing the need for military blood banks [37]. In 1943, Colonel Elliott C. Cutler\u2019s memorandum to Brigadier General Paul R. Hawley, Chief Surgeon, European Theatre of Operations, stated that \u201cBrigadier Whitby tells me that the use of wet plasma has practically been given up, and transfusion (of whole\nblood) used in its stead in the British Army\u201d [38].",

Bjerkvig argues for the consideration of failure in two additional linked and very dynamic organ systems, the endothelium and blood, both very sensitive to oxygen debt. The degree of damage to the endothelium is largely modulated by the degree of oxygen debt. Hypoperfusion causes oxygen debt and is believed to begin a cascade of events leading to acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC). This combination of oxygen debt-driven endothelial damage and ATC might be considered collectively as \u201cblood failure.\u201d The article presents the implications of oxygen debt remote damage control resuscitation strategies, such as permissive hypotension\nand hemostatic resuscitation [70, 71].",
