Supply chain management is an umbrella term that captures both operational and strategic functions to meet the needs of customers. Operational activities include routine sourcing, conversion, production, and logistics, while strategic functions focus on coordination, collaboration, and integration of key functions and processes within and across companies [17]. Logistics management is defined as \u201cthat part of supply chain management that plans, implements, and controls the efficient, effective forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and related information between the point of origin and the point of consumption to meet customers\u2019 requirements\u201d [17]. Both operational and strategic factors are critical considerations in designing high performing supply chains.

            "text": "Supply chain risk is a broad area encompassing events that arise due to uncertainty or unpredictability, and which lead to supply chain disruptions that have a negative impact on supply chain financial performance [4]. In general, risk is measured quantitatively by combining the probability of occurrence and the severity of impact [26]. Because of the links that exist between supply chain nodes in one supply chain and those in other supply chains (Brindley, 2004), understanding the source and nature of supply chain risks is important to effectively mitigate risk and manage supply chain performance. Supply chain risks stem from myriad sources, including offshore manufacturing, terrorism, political unrest, natural disasters, economic cycles, fluctuations in demand, infectious diseases, infrastructure, man-made disasters, currency volatility, price risks, information systems risk, quality risks, pilferage, lean supply chain strategies, outsourcing and sole sourcing, forecasting, intellectual property theft, customer payment default, inventory policies, capacity limitations, and delays due to disruptions, [4,[27], [28], [29], [30]]. Supply chain risk (SCR) and supply chain risk management (SCRM) definitions vary and include both customer and firm perspectives. For example, Chase and Jacobs [28] define supply chain risk as the probability that a disruption will reduce a supply chain's capability to deliver customer orders without delays. Zsidisin and Ritchie [31] define supply risk as \u201cthe probability of an incident associated with inbound supply from individual supply failures or the supply market occurring, in which its outcomes result in the inability of the purchasing firm to meet customer demand or cause threats to customer life and safety\u201d Benton [32] supports these definitions by defining supply chain risk in terms of the likelihood of an event occurring that results in negative consequences. Tang [4] takes a more corporate perspective by defining supply chain risk management as the \u201ccoordination and collaboration among supply chain partners to meet profitability requirements and ensure continuity.\u201d From these definitions it becomes obvious that management of risks in pharmaceutical supply chains is necessary to support the delivery of efficient, effective, and timely health care to patients.",

The term \u201cresilience\u201d is used to refer to the ability to return to a former state after being subjected to a period of stress. Ponomarov and Holcomb [39] describe supply chain resilience as the ability to adapt to unforeseen conditions, respond to disruptions, and recover to the desired level of performance to ensure business continuity [39]. Three dimensions of resilience are robustness, resources, and recovery [36]. Supply chain resilience includes preparedness, reaction, recovery, and growth [38]. The emphasis in the literature appears to be on recovery rather than preparedness, but proactiveness is critical for recovery and growth [38]. Some proactive measures discussed in the literature to ensure supply chain resilience include building buffer inventories; hedging currencies; developing rapid means of communication with supply chain partners; strategic staging of resources; resource pooling across supply chain echelons; identifying, evaluating, and approving alternative suppliers; redesigning products to facilitate the interchange of component parts; ensuring redundancy is built into digital networks; and designing supply chain networks such that the concentration of supply sources within a specific geographical area is reduced (Wisner et al., 2012; [4,28].",

These factors have been highlighted in regard to civilian risks following a disaster but are equally applicable to supply chain node risk. With regard to the first point, the dependencies within the supply chain system must be understood, including those factors that impact supply and demand balances within the supply chain. In reference to the second, transportation networks and logistics and supply chain relationships must be known and foreseen to understand where system failures are likely to occur in the movement of goods from supply to demand points. For the third point, critical infrastructures must be identified to enable redundancies, e.g., in the electric power, water, transportation, and telecommunications systems. The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season revealed several factors of importance in designing resilient supply chains to minimize failures and recovery delays in the event of a large-scale natural disaster.",

Failures in the transportation and logistics infrastructure also presented challenges in moving employees and materials to and from manufacturing plants [45] and materials through the main port [46,47]. Other infrastructural failures also impacted the pharmaceutical supply chain due to the ripple effect on factors that ultimately impacted supply chain performance.

FMEA has also been used in combination with other methods. Arabsheybani et al.

Other methods have been used to select suppliers, while also considering supplier risk factors. De Felice et al.

The authors evaluated seven factors: quality system, performance, technical capability, reputation, price and cost, financial stability, and geographical location. Kirytopoulos et al. [19] applied an Analytic Network Process (ANP) approach to evaluate pharmaceutical suppliers. Pourhejazy et al.

More robust quantitative approaches include mathematical programming models and stochastic methods. Fuzzy TOPSIS has been applied to quantify risk factors in pharmaceutical supply chains [51].

Sharma and Sharma [25] developed a conceptual Bayesian network model that integrated a variety of risks based on data collected across a number of industries.

Bayesian networks incorporate conditionalities, so that risk is computed based on a series of prior events that impact the outcomes. Bayesian networks have been applied to multifarious problems, e.g., to evaluate risk and reliability; diagnose the source of faults; prevent the likelihood of failures; assess how managerial interventions impact sustainability; predict uncertainty and metrics in manufacturing; and categorize data and manage projects.

Five risk factors that could cause reduced port operations efficiency are (i) employees failing to report to work, (ii) port equipment and facilities damaged, (iii) electric grid down, (iv) reduced trucking capacity between factory and port, and (v) increased inbound cargo.(i)The potential causal factors of employees failing to report to work are (a) a transportation system not functioning due to fuel supplies depleted because of increased demand for diesel to run home generators as a result of the electric grid going down following a Category IV or V hurricane, and impassable roads and bridges due to a Category IV or V hurricane (b) infeasible employer-employee communication due to the Internet and telecommunications system not operational following a Category IV or V hurricane, (c) employees' housing damaged due to a Category IV or V hurricane and employees' housing not constructed to withstand a Category IV or V hurricane, resulting in damaged roofs and walls, personal injury, and local or overseas displacement; (d) employees unable to access cash for transportation and other needs due to a failed banking system that is caused by a Category IV or V hurricane, which results in the electric grid down and the Internet and telecommunications system down; (e) employees unable to use Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards (payment cards issued under a federal nutrition assistance program to assist qualifying families with the purchase of food) at grocery stores to purchase food due to inoperability of ATM systems caused by a failed banking system and grocery stores closed due to a Category IV or V hurricane that results in the Internet and telecommunications system down, electric grid down, and reduced trucking capacity. Based on US Census data, just under half of Puerto Ricans live below the poverty line; therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a percentage of lower paid factory workers would be dependent on EBT cards to stock up on groceries.(ii)Causal factors for port equipment and facilities damaged or not functioning are a direct hit by a Category IV or V hurricane that damages or destroys material handling equipment and facilities, and also results in Internet and telecommunications down.\n(iii)If a Category IV or V hurricane hits, there is a high probability of the electric grid going down, particularly when these lines are above ground because of a lack of investment by a utilities company in financial distress.\n(iv)Three causal factors that have the potential to result in reduced trucking capacity for\n",

When truckers have limited fuel supplies and communication between factory and truckers is infeasible, there is a possibility that fuel will be conserved by avoiding futile commutes to facilities that are not operating, particularly if attempts to report to work have already been previously made.(v)If a Category IV or V hurricane hits an island location like Puerto Rico, there will be an influx of humanitarian supplies alongside regular imports that result in increased inbound cargo, thereby constraining limited resources and reducing port efficiency.\n\n",

Reduced Production Capacity: Reduced production capacity states are dependent on (i) the number of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sources and (ii) lost production days in the aftermath of a hurricane.(i)\nNumber of FDA Approved Sources: One of the main risk factors for reduced production capacity in the pharmaceutical industry is the number of FDA approved sources. On site- and production line-specific approvals granted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are required for pharmaceutical manufacturers to supply U.S. healthcare facilities. Within the same pharmaceutical company, production cannot be shifted from one site to another without FDA approval certifying compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). Without alternative FDA approved sites prior to a disaster, total production capacity remains fixed at best or reduced in the aftermath. The situation is exacerbated when manufacturers require high volume production to achieve economies of scale, leading to a single supplier situation. Risk factors for the number of FDA approved sources are (a) the percentage of product supplied by a single supplier (Baxter) and (b) the percentage of product supplied by other suppliers.\n(ii)Eight potential risk factors for lost production days are: (a) factory buildings damaged, (b) electric grid transmission lines destroyed, (c) diesel shortage for running factory generators, (d) clean water unavailable (e) Internet and telecommunications infrastructure down, (f) looting and lawlessness that could lead to curfew hours, restricting employee work time, (g) employees failing to report to work due to injury or local/overseas displacement, and (h) delays in inbound logistics due to port congestion from accumulation of containers due to an increase in inbound cargo from overseas and port equipment and facilities damaged.(a)Factory buildings damaged could result from a direct hit by a Category IV or V hurricane and factory buildings not constructed to withstand a Category IV or V hurricane, resulting in roof damage, wall collapse, broken doors and windows, equipment damage, and contamination due to flooding and entry of debris.(b)Risk factors for the electric grid down include inadequate investment in and maintenance of a resilient electric grid structure due to the utilities company's financial status.(c)Diesel shortage for generators could result due to fuel supplies depleted caused by a surge in fuel demand for residential home generators, grocery store freezers, and port generators due to the electric grid down following a Category IV or V hurricane, coupled with insufficient reserves at filling stations due to delays in inbound supplies from overseas.(d)Clean water unavailable could result from a Category IV or V hurricane that damages water lines and causes the electric grid to go down, resulting in water pumps not being powered.(e)If Internet and telecommunications go down, due to a Category IV or V hurricane, factories will likely resort to manual operations, decreasing production efficiency.(f)Curfews are imposed in disaster situations if there is anticipation or exhibition of lawlessness. If a curfew is imposed due to looting and lawlessness following a Category IV or V hurricane, factory production hours could be limited. In the case of Puerto Rico, the initial curfew imposed on September 20 was lifted within three days of the hurricane.(g)Employees failing to report to work could be caused by the transportation system down, employees housing damaged, cash non-accessible, employees unable to use EBT cards to obtain personal needs, or the Internet and telecommunications system down, hindering communication between the factory and employees.(h)Delays in inbound logistics could occur due to reduced port operations efficiency. Five causal factors for reduced port operations efficiency are (i) increased inbound cargo supply (relief and other supplies) due to a surge in vessel calls, (ii) employees failing to report to work, (iii) port equipment and facilities not functioning due to damage and Internet and telecommunications down, resulting in manual operations, (iv) reduced trucking capacity, and (v) electric grid down.\n\n",

The major risk factor for an increased demand for saline is an outbreak of disease (e.g. influenza) in the United States, which leads to an increase in hospitalization rates, resulting in the demand for saline above average season requirements to treat patients. Potential risk factors for a reduction in supply stem from reduced production capacity due to lost production days and a lack of redundancy in the number of FDA-approved suppliers. Another risk factor for supply shortage is delays in outbound logistics due to reduced port operations efficiency.",

At the time the hurricane hit, Puerto Rico's power generators were on average 28 years older than those of U.S. mainland utility companies and Puerto Ricans experienced 12 times as many blackouts [93]. Furthermore, Puerto Rican Power Utility (PREPA) filed for bankruptcy two months prior to Hurricane Maria [81,113,141]. Given this information, the Boolean node states for Utilities Company Financial Status (Node 4) were set at 95% bankrupt, 5% solvent. This signifies that there is a 95% chance that the utility company's poor financial status could have contributed to the failure of the electric grid, resulting in transmission lines down. Following landfall of the hurricane, a 100% blackout was experienced due to destruction of the electric grid transmission lines, towers, and hydro-electric dams [81,83,96,142]. Based on the causal factors, the NPT table probabilities for the Electric Grid (Node 11) resulted in 0.5% operational, 99.5% down.\u2022\nClean Water (Node 12)\n\n",

The Reduced Port Operations Efficiency (Node 26) is conditioned upon five factors, namely: Reduced Trucking Capacity, Port Equipment and Facilities Damaged, Electric Grid down, Increased Inbound Cargo Supply, and Employees Failing to Report to Work. Thus, if we design this variable using Boolean logic, it requires 25 = 32 entries, which is quite tedious and error prone as well. Moreover, many of those 32 entries may be unnecessary and have minimal impact on the Reduced Port Operations Efficiency node. As an alternative, the \u201cNoisyOR\u201d concept was used to design the posterior probability of this node. In addition, it is possible that there are other hidden factors that could influence the likelihood of a disruption. To account for these hidden or \u201cleak\u201d factors, a NoisyOR function is a convenient choice, where the leak factor is the extent to which factors absent from the model could contribute to the outcome being true. For example, this situation would apply if there are n variables designated as A\n1\n, A\n2\n\u2026. A\nn that are conditioned on B, with the probability of B being true when only one of the variables, A\n1, is true and all causal variables other than A1 are false, whereas leak factors are denoted by l.

Reduced port operations efficiency due to manual operations as a result of damaged port equipment and facilities, congestion arising from a surge in inbound container volumes, and the unavailability of truckers, precipitated a backlog that led to logistics delays for inbound raw materials [46,103,142,[147], [148], [149], [150]]; Gillespie, 2017; [5,136].

[145]; impassable roads and bridges, coupled with depleted fuel supplies, greatly impacted the availability of transportation. With a limited number of public bus lines running [152] to accommodate workers out of gas, the posterior probability of inaccessibility of transportation (Node 22) was calculated at 2.78% functional, 97.22% failed. Finally, it is obvious that if the Internet and telecommunications system goes down preventing communication with truckers, roads and bridges are impassable, and depleted fuel supplies are widespread, there will be a scarcity of drivers, resulting in reduced trucking capacity [46,47]. Based on reports indicating that only 20% of drivers reported for work [47,133], and in order to calculate the posterior probability of the reduced trucking capacity, the same NoisyOR logic has been applied as discussed above.",

The previously discussed \u201cweighted average\u201d concept was adopted to compute the posterior probability of the lost production days node. Reduced production capacity is predicated on two factors: lost production days [14,111] and available capacity among FDA approved suppliers following Hurricane Maria. Prior to Hurricane Maria, FDA approved plants were already operating at near full capacity with no supply redundancy [10]. This is supported by reports that indicate Baxter, which supplied approximately half of U.S. hospital saline, reduced order fulfillment quantities by 50% in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria [124]. Based on these contributing factors and reports, the posterior probabilities for reduced production capacity are calculated close to 24% True, 76% False.",

An example of prognostic reasoning is the entering of data on an extreme weather event, e.g. a hurricane, and predicting the resulting risk exposure to an object or system. In our study, we consider prognostic inference reasoning also known as forward propagation analysis to predict the likelihood of disruption in hospital supplies under a combination of influential factors modeled using historical data and expert opinion based on the events following Hurricane Maria. The forward propagation of the model seeks to evaluate the outcome of the target node, disruption in hospital supplies, given the nodal probabilities of the causal factors.",

The three variables were selected because these factors exacerbated an already strained production situation following Hurricane Maria. The unique requirements of the pharmaceutical industry for cGMP compliant facilities and economies of scale in manufacturing encourage large scale production by a few suppliers. This could lead to a precarious single source situation. Epidemics are also likely risks faced by the healthcare sector. In the event of a major epidemic, product demand could rise sharply above existing requirements. Port failure could highly impact the pharmaceutical transportation network to carry the product (saline) from the supplier to the customer (hospitals) within the stipulated time frame. All of these observations together have a negative impact on the hospital supply chain and the results of the propagation analysis indicate that disruption in the hospital supply chain could rise from 65.73% to as high as 89.18%.",

In the event of a disaster, the flow of hospital supplies to the mainland could be quickly severed if the port's primary infrastructure is destroyed forcing a shutdown or if operations are slowed to a pace that fails to synchronize supply with demand. Moreover, the port is a critical juncture in the flow of both inbound raw materials for pharmaceutical manufacturing and outbound finished goods, signifying that any bottleneck in operations will seriously hamper supplies to U.S. hospitals.

Although the Bayesian network is a static model, by understanding the probability of recovery at different points in time following a major hurricane disaster (see Fig. 5), a risk manager can use the model for decision-making in three ways: (i) proactively, to guide the design of a resilient pharmaceutical supply chain network, including the selection of supplier locations to minimize severe weather risk, (2) proactively, to perform scenario analysis to support the development of a risk response contingency plan to minimize the impact of adverse events on supply chain performance, and (iii) reactively, to update the Bayesian model in crisis management situations as data on recovery progress becomes available, to determine the impact on supply chain performance to the end customer. The model can be adapted to include other concurrent non-weather risk events as indicated in the case of the influenza outbreak in the United States. This would allow supply chain managers to more effectively plan for risk management in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The Bayesian network model can also be adapted for the dynamic case by dividing the recovery timeline into time slices and using the associated probabilities in each case to make a prediction.",

At least up to November 2017, a rationing system was required since orders could only be partially filled due to Baxter not being fully reconnected to the electric grid and the persistence of operations and logistics problems [[159], [160], [161]].
