            "text": "Avian influenza virus (AIV) H9N2 emerged in the 1990s as an economically important disease in poultry and occasionally infects humans and other mammals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acquisition and retention of H9N2 AIV on and within the house fly, Musca domestica (Linnaeus 1758), under laboratory conditions. In first experiment, 100 adult house flies were divided into control and treatment groups equally. Treatment group was fed with a meal containing H9N2 virus, while control group was supplied with an identical meal without virus. Fifteen minutes after exposure in each group, flies were washed twice to remove surface particles, disinfected and then homogenized for testing. The two external body surface washes and the homogenate samples were tested for H9N2 to distinguish exterior from interior viral load. Second experiment was performed likewise but five flies from each group were taken at 0, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h post-exposure. All samples were subjected to real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) for detecting H9-Specific viral RNA. Results of the first experiment showed that viral RNA was detectable in both of external surface and homogenates samples. Second experiment revealed that persistence of H9N2 AIVs on external body surface and within the body of M. domestica were 24 and 96 h, respectively. Moreover, viral RNAs concentration declined during the time after exposure to AIV H9N2 either outside or within house flies. Overall, house fly was able to acquire and preserve H9N2 AIV experimentally, which may contribute the spread of virus among poultry farms.",

Two major issues arose with LPAIV H9N2 1) due to persistent outbreaks and widespread vaccination programs it served as a barrier to poultry market economics and 2) from 1998 on, 15 reports of human infections were published suggesting an increasing likelihood of a pandemic (Cox et al. 2017) . Frequency of AI infections in different countries is affected by the structure of poultry sector, including density of poultry production, the infection status, biosecurity practices, and environmental conditions (Paul et al. 2011 , Sims et al. 2017 . LPAIV infections have been reported with varying mortality and morbidity in different developing countries. Since the first Iranian outbreak of H9N2 in 1998, mortality between 20 and 65% has been reported and endemic H9N2 AI virus has imposed a huge strain on the economy of poultry industry (Nili and Asasi 2002) .",

AIV remained viable up to 105 d in liquid manure during winter, 30-35 d at 4\u00b0C in feces and 7 d at 20\u00b0C, and therefore it stands a better chance of dispersal (Sims et al. 2017 ). In addition, transmission of AIV seems to occur through viruses shed from nares, mouth, conjunctiva, and cloaca, either by direct bird-to-bird contact or indirectly via aerosol droplets, contaminated food, water, fomites, and people. Therefore, synanthropic animals such as rodents, wild terrestrial birds, and insects like flies may be possible vectors of AIV (Velkers et al. 2017) . Previously in areas with AI outbreak history, H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses were isolated from house flies, blow flies, black garbage flies, and small dung flies (Brugh and Johnson 1986, Sawabe et al. 2006) .",

After immobilization at \u221220\u00b0C for 2 min, two specimens were obtained by washing external body surface of flies with 1.5 ml of PBS inside falcons; S3 (first outer surface wash fluid before ethanol washing) and S4 (Second wash fluid after disinfecting outer surface). The third specimen (H2) was also obtained after whole body homogenizing of house flies as described in first experiment, but with 1.5 ml of PBS. All samples were labeled with group, sample name, and time point, then were frozen until being subjected to RRT-PCR. The experiment 2 also had five replicates.",

Finally, its concentration was determined by Epoch microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek instrument, United States) as nanogram per microliter. The copy number of H9 gene in the standard was calculated according to the following formula: Number of copies (molecules) = (X ng \u00d7 6.0221 \u00d7 10 23 molecules/mole)/ [(N \u00d7 660 g/mole) \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10 9 ng/g], where X is amount of amplicon (ng), N is length of dsDNA amplicon and 660 g/mole = average mass of 1 bp dsDNA.

More recently, in 2016, a viral exposure experiment also showed the existence of AIV H5N1 for at least 24 h in gastrointestinal tracts of house flies (Tyasasmaya et al. 2016) . In crop of house flies, live Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was detected up to 96 h after initial exposure to NDV while it remained viable only 24 h in midgut and hindgut (Watson et al. 2007 ). However, the H5N1 AIV was isolated from the feces of blowflies Calliphora nigribarbis (Vollenhoven 1863) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) at 48 h after exposure (Sawabe et al. 2009 ). Under experimental conditions, sugar was used in feeding meal and high sugar concentration correlates with meal storage in crop, even for several days (Greenberg 1973) . Thus, dissemination of virus through defecation and specially regurgitation seems more feasible. Flies were not dissected in the current study; however, in order to elucidate different probable routes of virus transmission and spread by flies, we are currently in the process of discovering virus retention sites in each dissected body fractures comparatively.",

The virus did not replicate inside the house fly, supporting the dominant paradigm of mechanical but not biological transmission of avian viruses; rotavirus, turkey coronavirus, reticuloendotheliosis virus, and NDV (Tan et al. 1997 , Calibeo-Hayes et al. 2003 , Davidson and Braverman 2005 , Barin et al. 2010 . Although this is the first experimental study elucidating the dynamic of H9N2 AIV retention in flies, it did not evaluate the viability of virus post-exposure. But generally, the RNA load probably is a high estimate of the viable virus that could be present and that when the samples are negative for RNA, there should not be any viable virus present, however, particularly HPAI H5N1 was shown to remain viable up to 72 h in a similar experiment (Wanaratana et al. 2011) . Further works, which take viability of the viruses into account, is intended to be undertaken using subsequent inoculation to culture media or chickens. The answer to the question 'if the number of viral particles suffice to be transmitted and to infect a chicken in different critical routes?' is deferred to our future work in controlled field conditions.",

In endemic countries, especially those with low quality of biosecurity practices, flies might be involved in intrafarm or close transmission which needs practical implications like reducing flies population as well as boosting biosecurity measures.",
