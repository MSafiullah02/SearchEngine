AAA is defined as an aorta with a diameter more than 30 mm. 3 True abdominal aortic aneurysms affect all three layers of the aortic wall and are characterized by their shape and location. Fusiform aneurysms, the most common type, involve the entire circumference of the aorta while saccular aneurysms involve only part of the circumference of the aorta. 1 The most common location for these aneurysms is infrarenal, usually located several centimeters below the renal arteries, extending to the aortic bifurcation, and frequently involve the iliac arteries.

Inflammatory aneurysms are thought to arise from an immune response to an antigen in the adventitial wall. This antigen is unknown but is thought to be viral, a lipid, or a product of lipid peroxidation from atherosclerosis. 7 Herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus have been identified in the aortic wall in patients with inflammatory AAAs. 6 Patients with inflammatory AAAs are very symptomatic (back, flank, and abdominal pain) and have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.",

Elastin in the media is responsible for the viscoelastic properties of the aorta while collagen present in both media and adventitia provides tensile strength to help maintain the structural integrity of the aortic wall. Early in aneurysm formation, there is fragmentation of elastic fibers, and, as the aneurysm develops, there is degradation of collagen, which is the ultimate cause of rupture. This process is mediated by proteolytic enzymes such as the matrix metalloproteins (MMPs) and plasmin-generated plasminogen activators. 9 There is also a reduction in smooth muscle cells in the media, which participate in vascular wall remodeling and have a protective role against inflammation and proteolysis. 10 AAAs may be associated with mural thrombus formation. Since the thrombus is continuously exposed to blood flow, there is constant remodeling of the thrombus. This leads to ongoing coagulation and fibrinolytic activity as measured by increased serum thrombin-antithrombin III complex and D-dimer levels. 11 Although the thrombus may reduce wall stress, its increasing thickness may lead to local hypoxia at the inner layer of the media, which can induce medial neovascularization and inflammation.",

An AAA may be diagnosed on a lateral abdominal x-ray if calcifications are present, which may allow visualization of the dilated aorta. Abdominal ultrasonography is the simplest and least expensive diagnostic modality. It can accurately measure aortic size and can be used for diagnosis, follow-up surveillance, and screening. 13 If there is an aneurysm detected on screening, the next step is to perform an abdominal CT to determine the type of treatment. 14 Information that can be elicited from a CT includes visualization of the proximal neck, extension to the iliac arteries, patency of the visceral arteries, and the presence and thickness of a mural thrombus. CT can also detect anatomic variants such as a left vena cava, posterior left renal vein, or horseshoe kidney that may interfere with the procedure, and can reveal blood within the mural thrombus called the crescent sign, which may be a predictive marker of imminent rupture. 15 In patients with inflammatory aneurysms, CT can estimate the thickness of the aortic wall and determine the presence of para-aortic fibrosis. CT can also be used to determine the suitability for placement of endovascular devices. (Figs. 14.1 and 14.2).",

Rupture of the anterolateral wall of the aneurysm into the peritoneal wall carries mortality between 60 and 97% (Fig. 14.4 and 14.5). Most patients (88%) present with a rupture of the posterolateral wall into the retroperitoneum where the rupture can be sealed by clot formation, retroperitoneal hematoma, and abdominal muscle tone, and hemorrhage is limited by hypotension. This event is followed within hours by a larger rupture. The period between the two ruptures is called the intermediate period and is the time where the diagnosis and emergency repair can be accomplished. 1 The triad of symptoms of an RAAA include sudden onset of midabdominal or flank pain radiating to the scrotum, circulatory shock, and the presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass. The presence of flank ecchymosis (Grey Turner sign) represents retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Diagnosis is mostly clinical, but ultrasound, CT or MRI scanning, or aortagraphy can also be helpful depending on hemodynamic stability. Contrast CT shows extravasation of contrast material, which is diagnostic of rupture. Early diagnosis reduces mortality by 50%. In rare cases, the first episode of rupture can be contained to become a chronic pulsatile extra-aortic hematoma or aneurysms can rupture into another structure, such as the duodenum, producing an aorto-duodenal fistula or the vena cava, which can lead to lower extremity edema. 17",

They randomized patients appropriate for open repair between endovascular repair (EVAR) and open repair (OR). EVAR decreased perioperative complications, including myocardial events, and was associated with decreased recovery times. In patients with large AAAs who are fit for OR, EVAR offers an initial mortality advantage over OR, with a persistent reduction in AAArelated death at 4 years. However, EVAR offers no overall survival benefit, is more costly, and requires more interventions and indefinite surveillance with only a brief Quality of Life (QOL) benefit. 19 Open repair is more durable and does not require the extensive surveillance unlike endovascular repairs. This may lead to a better quality of life. The DREAM trial patients received QOL questionnaires preoperatively, then at 3 weeks, 6 months, and at 1 year. Preoperative scores were similar. At 3 weeks, the patients undergoing endovascular repair had a better quality of life, but at 6 months and 1 year, the patients undergoing the open repair reported a better quality of life. 20",

After the proximal anastomosis is completed, a second clamp is placed on the graft to assess the strength of the anastomosis under pressure. The distal anastomosis is then performed either to the distal aorta or iliac arteries.

The retroperitoneal dissection is extended to the diaphragmatic hiatus, and the left crus is divided to expose the supraceliac aorta. The proximal clamp is then placed above the celiac axis or between the renal and superior mesenteric arteries. The inferior mesenteric artery is tied close to the aortic wall to keep it collateral to the superior mesenteric artery. In some cases, the inferior mesenteric artery is reimplanted into the aortic prosthesis to maintain blood flow to the sigmoid colon and rectum. Reimplantation is required if there is significant stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery and celiac trunk or if internal iliac flow cannot be restored after abdominal aortic surgery. 22 If the left renal artery cannot be directly included into the anastomosis, it has to be reimplanted into the graft after primary reconstruction has been completed. The surgical risks of pararenal repair are greater because of renal and possibly mesenteric ischemia, increased alterations in cardiovascular physiology due to the higher aortic cross-clamp, and atheroembolization.",

Coronary revascularization is also indicated in patients with stable angina with left main disease, stable angina with 3-vessel disease, and stable angina with 2-vessel disease and proximal left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 0.50 where the survival benefits are proven. 33 Preoperative treatment of patients with no active cardiac conditions but with significant clinical risk factors, such as a history of CAD, stable angina, treated stable or past history of heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, age more than 70 years, renal insufficiency, and diabetes mellitus is more complex. It is controversial whether these patients benefit from preoperative testing and subsequent revascularization. Few clinical trials addressed this issue.",

Though they excluded patients with unstable angina, left main coronary artery stenosis, and a low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 74% of their patients had 2 or more clinical risk factors or moderate or large reversible perfusion defects on nuclear stress testing. 34 The DECREASE-2 (Dutch Echocardiographic Cardiac Risk Evaluation Applying Stress Echo) clinical trial evaluated the value of preoperative cardiac stress testing in intermediate risk (1-2 risk factors) patients. Patients (n = 770) were randomly assigned to testing (n = 386) and no testing. All patients received beta-blockers. Tested and nontested patients had similar 30-day cardiovascular mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction after vascular surgery. Limited ischemia was detected in 17% and extensive ischemia (>3 walls in stress perfusion scintigraphy or > 5 segments in dobutamine stress echocardiography) in 8.8% of tested patients. Of 33 patients with extensive ischemia, only 12 were suitable for revascularization, which did not improve 30-day outcome. However, the cardiovascular death or MI was higher in patients with extensive ischemia (odds ratio, OR = 107) and limited ischemia (OR = 42), compared to patients with no ischemia. 35 The same group of investigators followed up with the DECREASE V clinical trial in which they randomized high-risk (> 2 clinical risk factors) patients with extensive ischemia during cardiac testing into revascularization (n = 49) and norevascularization groups (n = 51). Revascularization did not improve 30-day or 1-year composite outcomes (cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction) after the intended vascular surgery. 36 The results from these studies indicate that high or intermediate risk patients with stable CAD may undergo AAA repair without preoperative revascularization if medical therapy is expected to yield similar protection. The lack of benefit of revascularization is not fully understood, though plaque rupture induced by the perioperative stress response in nonsignificant coronary lesions, which are not revascularized, may be the culprit. 37 Noninvasive stress testing has a low positive predictive value and is not routinely recommended in intermediate and low-risk groups. High risk (>2 risk factors) with poor functional status may be referred for stress testing for risk stratification, though the benefits of revascularization in patients with extensive ischemia are not well demonstrated.",

            "text": "Among the revascularization methods, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was associated with increased risk of MI compared to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in DECREASE V and CARP trials. Several other studies raised similar concerns. The increased risk could be related to stent thrombosis after PCI, especially if dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) is discontinued perioperatively. The type of PCI planned will depend on the interval between PCI and planned noncardiac surgery. If AAA repair is planned within a month, bare metal stent implantation or balloon angioplasty are the most recommended options. With bare metal stents, after the month of dual antiplatelet therapy, the clopidogrel may be discontinued but aspirin should be continued. If discontinued, the clopidogrel should be restarted as soon as possible in the postoperative period. Drug-eluting stents require 12 months of uninterrupted dual antiplatelet therapy before discontinuing clopidogrel to prevent stent thrombosis. 33 In patients with unstable CAD and AAA, the options for treatment include a combined CABG/ AAA repair or a staged approach with shorter interval (2 weeks) between revascularization and AAA repair. The disadvantage of the staged procedure is postoperative rupture of the AAA, which can occur in up to 30% of patients. 38 The staged approach is therefore appropriate when aneurysm rupture is not imminent, such as with nontender aneurysms between 5 and 8 cm in diameter. 39 The combined approach has been adopted in patients when rupture of the aneurysm is imminent in the immediate postoperative period, which includes tender aneurysms, large aneurysms > 8 cm, rapidly enlarging aneurysms, and aneurysms with recent contained leaks. The advantages of the combined procedure are a reduced total anesthesia time, convalescence, hospital stay, and total costs. 40, 41 The CABG can be done on or off cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] In pump cases, both CABG and AAA repair were done while on CPB in some patients while in others, AAA resection was performed after weaning from CPB. 47 CABG on CPB is known to activate inflammatory mediators, produce coagulopathy and embolic phenomenon leading to end organ damage. Operative mortality is high in these patients and ranges from 6% to 33%. 48 Off-pump CABG is a safe and effective alternative to on-pump CABG in these patients. In selected patients, endovascular AAA repair with CABG is an option and can be done either as combined or staged procedure. 48 The anesthetic management of the combined procedure is similar to that for CABG alone. When the AAA is performed following the CABG, the initial heparinization required for CPB is reversed with protamine and then an additional smaller dose of heparin (5,000 U) is administered prior to aneurysm clamping. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable or who have large aneurysms, the surgeon may elect to perform the repair on CPB. This technique is associated with longer bypass times, which can be complicated by post-bypass coagulopathy, myocardial dysfunction due to long ischemic times, and hemodynamic instability. 49 In patients with diffuse small-vessel CAD and poor ventricular function, preoperative medical optimization with aspirin, statins, and beta-blockers and intensive perioperative monitoring may reduce the risk of AAA repair. Other options for these patients include serial three-monthly observations with abdominal ultrasound or internal iliac ligation with axillobifemoral bypass. 50 Besides CAD, the preoperative evaluation should detect and determine the extent of other comorbid diseases including diabetes, hypertension with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, COPD, chronic renal insufficiency, and cerebrovascular disease. Medications that are commonly prescribed to these patients include antihypertensive agents, oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin, diuretics, inhaled bronchodilators and steroids, antianginal agents, antiplatelet agents, and anticoagulants. Except for diuretics and possibly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, patients should continue their antihypertensive regimen up to the time of surgery.",

However, all RWMA are not ischemic and not all RWMA detected by TEE correlate with postoperative complications. 52 TEE, the most sensitive monitor of myocardial ischemia, can also be used to evaluate volume status and valvular function. Cardiac output measured by TEE correlates very well with thermodilution cardiac output derived from PAC in the absence of significant mitral regurgitation. 53 Myocardial performance index (MPI), uses measurements taken during the cardiac cycle, from end-diastole to the next end-diastole, is calculated using isovolumetric contraction time (IVCT), isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), and ejection time (ET). This index is believed to describe both systolic and diastolic performance of the myocardium. An elevated MPI has been shown to predict poor outcomes (congestive and ventilatory failure) in patients undergoing AAA repair. 54 Cardiac output can be measured from continuous analysis of pulse pressure waveform by the insertion of a catheter with manometer into axillary or brachial artery. These pulse contour cardiac output (PiCCO; Pulsion Medical Inc, East Brunswick, NJ, USA) devices can also measure transpulmonary thermodilution cardiac output, but require insertion of central venous catheter in addition to arterial catheter. 55 Echo-esophageal Doppler (Hemosonic 100; Arrow, Reading, PA), which measures cardiac output through mean blood velocity in the descending aorta and diameter of descending aorta, have been found to be useful in infrarenal abdominal aortic surgery. 56 These could be potential alternatives for PAC in these patients, although these devices need further evaluation and validation during different periods of aortic surgery such as clamping and unclamping.",

This can be explained by the effect of the level of crossclamp on blood volume redistribution and myocardial function as described in the chapter on anesthesia for open descending aortic surgery. 57, 58 Left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction are not uncommon in AAA surgical patients. The impact of aortic cross-clamping on diastolic dysfunction and the resultant hemodynamic changes in patients with diastolic dysfunction are not well studied. Infrarenal clamping is associated with a change in ventricular compliance and PCWP did not correlate with left ventricular end-diastolic area (LVEDA) during aortic cross-clamping. 59 Mahmood et al., using transmitral flow propagation velocity in 35 patients undergoing elective AAA surgery, reported an increase in diastolic dysfunction after aortic cross-clamping, which returned to baseline after unclamping. They did not report any hemodynamic parameters, so the impact of the diastolic dysfunction is not clear. 60 Meierhenrich et al. reported a 50% baseline incidence of diastolic dysfunction in patients undergoing AAA repair. Aortic cross-clamping was not associated with impairment of diastolic dysfunction and the hemodynamic changes were similar in patients with or without diastolic dysfunction. 61 Shuetz et al. have shown that the treated hypertensive patients had significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP), PCWP, and mean peak A/peak E velocity after cross-clamping, compared to normotensive controls, but these disturbances normalized after unclamping and the intraoperative management did not differ in both groups. 62 Fayed et al. reported acute diastolic dysfunction after high aortic clamping in six of nine patients with normal E/A ratios before clamping in thoracoabdominal surgery and three of those patients developed myocardial infarction. 63 The level of aortic cross clamp again has an influence on diastolic dysfunction and its effect on outcome.",

Ten patients had evidence of CAD and 15 did not. They concluded that patients with preexisting CAD had significantly lower cardiac indices and increased PCWP, which may suggest that this subgroup is at greater risk for perioperative myocardial dysfunction. 66 Patients with aortic occlusive disease may experience less hemodynamic changes compared to AAA patients to clamping and unclamping. Johnston et al. compared hemodynamics in patients with aneurysmal and aorto-occlusive disease and found that patients in the aortoocclusive group had an increased stroke volume and less of an increase in SVR during aortic cross-clamping compared to patients with aneurysmal disease. 67 These findings could be explained by persistent para-aortic collateral circulation to the lower extremities in chronic occlusive disease and minimal metabolite and lactate accumulation. 68, 69 This accounts for the stable hemodynamics that occurs during aortic crossclamping in patients undergoing repair of aortoocclusive disease.",

During clamping of infrarenal aorta, the lower extremities undergo ischemic vasodilatation and vasomotor paralysis. Release of the clamp causes blood sequestration in the previously ischemic lower extremities, central hypovolemia, and decreased blood flow to the critical coronary, renal, and hepatic circulations (Fig. 14.7) . The use of vasopressors to increase the blood pressure without restoring blood volume may further decrease blood flow to these critical organs. Adequate volume loading prior to release of the clamp to a higher PCWP than the baseline value is recommended. 70 Ueda et al. 71 used volume loading with 10 ml/kg of albumin before unclamping during AAA repair and have shown that albumin did not prevent systemic hypotension, but significantly increased pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular afterload causing RV dilatation. Cautious fluid administration is recommended in patients with cardiac dysfunction. Bitoh et al. 72 reported left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, measured using the mitral annular velocity by tissue Doppler method, after unclamping in eight patients undergoing infrarenal AAA repair and the dysfunction persisted until the end of the surgery. Pulmonary edema occurred in two of their patients with the lowest tissue Doppler mitral annular velocity. Gradual release of the clamp is recommended to prevent adverse events after unclamping in such cases. Close communication with surgical team is essential.",

Typically, rapid sequence induction is done with etomidate and succinylcholine. All other medications, such as fentanyl, midazolam, and inhalational anesthetics, should be titrated very carefully in these patients. Scopolamine can be used to produce amnesia in hemodynamically unstable patients. Vasopressors and fluids should be administered cautiously before clamping, as aggressive resuscitation may unplug the hemostatic clot and cause bleeding. Several animal studies using an abdominal aortotomy model of ruptured AAA have demonstrated improved tissue perfusion, decreased blood loss, and improved survival associated with hypotensive resuscitation compared with aggressive resuscitation. 73 There are human studies advocating delayed rather than immediate resuscitation in trauma patients, 74, 75 but there are no prospective studies of hypotensive resuscitation in patients with ruptured AAAs. Minimal fluid resuscitation seems to be a logical option provided rapid surgical control of bleeding could be achieved. After induction, a PAC is inserted and TEE can be used along with the PAC to monitor volume status and contractility. Arterial blood gases should be obtained to determine the presence of acidosis, electrolyte abnormalities, and hematocrit. A normal hematocrit may be indicative of hemoconcen-tration. If massive blood transfusion is required, a 1:1 mixture of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be administered to prevent dilutional coagulopathy. Autotransfusion may also be useful. Platelets and cryoprecipitate should be available if multiple units of PRBCs and FFP are administered or if the patient is taking antiplatelet agents. Once the aneurysm is clamped, the goal is to maintain hemodynamics and to preserve cardiac function. Hypotension during maintenance is multifactorial and includes the loss of sympathetic tone, hypovolemia, and cardiac dysfunction. If the patient is hypotensive despite adequate fluid resuscitation, vasopressor agents, such as vasopressin or norepinephrine, may be required if the patient has normal cardiac function and inotropic agents, such as epinephrine or dopamine, may be required if the patient has decreased cardiac function. If massive transfusions have been administered, the patient may have citrate toxicity and calcium chloride should be administered. Unclamping shock can be profound and is related to the duration of clamping, degree of shock prior to clamping, the speed with which clamps are released, and the patient's volume status and cardiovascular reserve.",

The blood loss during AAA surgery can occur from the lumbar arteries when aneurysm is opened or at the proximal and distal anastomotic site. Bleeding may be related to inadequate hemostasis, coagulopathy, or excess heparinization. Techniques to reduce homologous blood transfusion are employed to reduce the transfusion risks and prevent the adverse effects associated with extensive stored blood therapy. Preadmission autologous blood donation (PABD) in combination with intraoperative autotransfusion (IAT) has been shown to eliminate the need for homologous transfusion in two thirds of elective AAA patients. 80 Similar efficacy of PABD with IAT was demonstrated in aortic surgery when compared with IAT alone or with no conservation technique. 81, 82 Erythropoietin has also been used in patients undergoing preoperative blood donation. 83 The routine use of IAT in all elective AAA patients is controversial. A meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of IAT reported 37% reduction in risk of allogenic blood transfusion. 84 Few other studies reported lack of efficacy and found this practice to be not cost-effective when applied to all AAA patients. 85, 86 While some surgeons use IAT routinely, few others consider it in selected operations where blood loss is likely to be high, such as RAAA, complex reconstructions, thoracoabdominal aneurysms and suprarenal aneurysm surgery, or in patients with religious concerns. 87 The disadvantages of the washed red cells are that they do not contain platelets or coagulation factors. TEG is utilized intraoperatively to detect and treat coagulopathy. Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) has been used in combination with intraoperative cell savage (ICS) and found to be an effective strategy for AAA patients. 88 Wolowczyk et al. 89 in a randomized controlled clinical trial compared ANH with ICS to ICS alone in patients undergoing elective AAA repair and concluded that ANH did not reduce transfusion requirements and had no impact on systemic inflammatory response or overall outcome. Even without ANH, the large volumes of fluid infused as part of standard fluid management in these patients produced hemodilution, which is the reason why additional ANH is ineffective in saving bank blood. 90",

Added to the hemodynamic stress is hypofibrinolysis and thrombin activation leading to prothrombotic state and myocardial injury. 109, 110 Identifying perioperative MI is difficult because chest pain is infrequent (fewer than 50% of ischemic episodes are symptomatic) and disguised by analgesics. ECG is the mainstay of the diagnosis, but the changes may be subtle and transient. Most of the postoperative MIs are of the non-Q wave variety.

Pararenal AAAs are aneurysms that involve the renal ostia and include juxtarenal AAAs, which involve the renal artery origin and suprarenal AAAs, which involve the aorta above the renal arteries. 3. AAAs associated with mural thrombi have increased coagulation and fibrinolytic activity, produce local hypoxia in the media, which can lead to neovascularization and inflammation. 4.

Ultrasound is the recommended screening modality CT or MRI are used to delineate the anatomy of the aneurysm, and aortography, the gold standard, is reserved for patients with inconclusive studies. 5. For ruptured AAAs, the triad of symptoms include sudden onset of mid-abdominal or flank pain radiating to the scrotum, circulatory shock, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. 6.

The retroperitoneal approach is associated with decreased pain and perioperative complications, and is the approach of choice for pararenal aneurysms. 8. SIRS, more common in patients with RAAAs, is associated with the release of endotoxin, which causes the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNFa, and IL-6b, leading to the development of ARDS and MOF. 9. Advanced age, cardiac arrest with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, hypotension, loss of consciousness, low hematocrit, and elevated creatinine are associated with a poor outcome. 10. Since up to half of patients with AAAs have underlying coronary artery disease and perioperative cardiac complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality, these patients should be evaluated according to the 2007 ACC/AHA guidelines. 11. Monitoring for patients with uncomplicated AAAs includes standard ASA monitors, along with arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, and urine output. For highrisk patients, additional monitoring may include pulmonary artery catheterization and transesophageal echocardiography. 12. The effects of aortic cross-clamping depends on the level of the clamp, the baseline myocardial function and presence of CAD, the type of aortic disease and degree of collateralization, volume status, and anesthetic technique. 13. Aortic unclamping produces hypotension and acidosis, which is due to the release of vasodilating and myocardial depressant metabolites from ischemia and reperfusion. This can be treated with vasopressors, fluid administration, and reclamping, if necessary. 14. The most important determinant of survival in patients with RAAA is time to aortic crossclamp. The goals of anesthetic management in these include performing a rapid evaluation, including hemodynamic status, obtaining large bore intravenous access, obtaining blood and blood products for transfusion, and maintaining hemodynamic stability, with vasoactive agents 15. Fluid and transfusion management for these patients should include fluid restriction and blood conservation techniques, including cell salvage. Patients with coagulopathy during AAA repair should be monitored with TEG and treated with blood products and factor VIIa, if necessary. 16 . Postoperative pain management in these patients is diverse and includes neuraxial analgesia with spinal opioids or epidural anesthesia, paravertebral analgesia, and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia. 17. Although the most common perioperative complication is cardiovascular, other complications during AAA repair include renal, pulmonary, neurological, gastrointestinal, hemorrhage, DIC, and limb ischemia.",
