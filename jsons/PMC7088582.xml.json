Torture, for instance, is usually thought to be absolutely prohibited in the ordinary course of things. However, many people think that in certain extreme circumstances, it may be justified. Suppose that an unusually capable terrorist has planted hydrogen bombs in London, Manchester, and Birmingham, and plans to set them off simultaneously. Time is short, and the only way to stop the bombs from going off is to torture the terrorist into revealing their location. In this situation \u2013 one of supreme emergency \u2013 it can be argued that the absolute ban on torture should be lifted and that the terrorist may, or even should, be tortured. It might even be justifiable to torture or at least threaten to torture innocent people in order to avoid the consequences of the hydrogen bombs. Or so the argument goes.1\n",

Britain responded to the Nazi threat by bombing German cities, thus deliberately targeting non-combatants and thereby blatantly violating the perhaps most firmly established rule of war. Was that justifiable, given the supreme emergency Britain, and not only Britain but also a large part of the civilised world, found itself in? Michael Walzer, the most well-known writer on the supreme emergency argument, argues, hesitantly, that it was (Walzer 2000, Ch. 16).2\n",

In his widely known Just and Unjust Wars, he describes a supreme emergency as being defined by two conditions: the nature of the looming danger and its imminence. Both conditions must be fulfilled for a supreme emergency to be present: the danger must be imminent, and, in addition, \u2018of an unusual and horrifying kind\u2019 (Walzer 2000, p. 253). In a less often-quoted essay entitled \u2018Emergency Ethics\u2019, he states that \u2018[a] supreme emergency exists when our deepest values and our collective survival are in imminent danger\u2019 (Walzer 2004, p. 33). I take the phrase about collective survival and deep values to be a way of making more precise the condition of horribleness. Thus, a supreme emergency is a situation where our deepest values and/or collective survival are in imminent danger.",

I will begin by giving some background on the debate on the supreme emergency argument and its place in the just war tradition. Then I will outline its possible application to non-antagonistic threats. Finally, I will examine two rather different versions of the supreme emergency doctrine \u2013 those of Michael Walzer and Brian Orend. I will argue, first, that it is doubtful whether Walzer\u2019s position is applicable to non-antagonistic threats, and that it is even more doubtful whether it is defensible.

For a supreme emergency to be present, the threat has to be directed against a community rather than, say, merely against a large number of non-related individuals. Walzer himself is explicit about this, and claims that \u2018[s]upreme emergency is a communitarian doctrine\u2019 (Walzer 2004, p. 45). Second, the threat to the community is usually regarded as antagonistic. Antagonistic threats that are threats brought about by agents with malicious intent. Supreme emergencies are typically not thought to be about threats from volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, asteroids or the like. Third, the morally problematic actions supposedly permitted by reference to a situation of supreme emergency are typically thought to be directed against members of the collective that poses the threat, not against innocent bystanders.",

In this tradition, two types of issues have been distinguished. One concerns jus ad bellum, or right to war, and the other jus in bello, right in war.

War must also be declared by recognised authorities, e.g. a democratic government. It must also not be doomed to fail from the outset.

The central theme of discrimination is that only some targets, such as soldiers and military installations, are legitimate, and thus allowable to target intentionally. The typical example is that combatants, such as members of the armed forces, are legitimate targets, but that non-combatants, such as civilians or wounded, incapacitated soldiers, are not.",

            "text": "One possibility is that environmental emergencies are thought to call for environmentally benign dictatorship or \u2018ecofascism\u2019 (Zimmerman 1995). Another, perhaps more important case in point is disease control. Historical examples show that draconian measures in the face of diseases thought to be emerging plagues have sometimes been both advocated and implemented. Calls for such measures were to some extent heard during the early days of the AIDS epidemic (H\u00e4yry and H\u00e4yry 1989). From earlier times, there are examples of forced removals and draconian punishment for violation of sanitation rules as responses to the threat of yellow fever (Ngalamulume 2004), as well as that of plague (Kallioinen 2006). It is also a common but contested idea that societies historically have tended to become more violent in the wake of plagues (Cohn 2002). There have been arguments advanced that this provides a moral reason to prevent or at least curtail public emergencies. Tom Sorell (2003, p. 31) argues that extreme emergency situations \u2013 including not only war, but also those brought about by non-antagonistic threats \u2013 are \u2018not only occasions for great harm; they are also occasions for the serious rupture of moral conventions\u2019. The very institution of morality is at risk, as emergencies threaten to suck us into a \u2018moral black hole\u2019. They \u2018undermine everyday morality itself at a place and time\u2019 (ibid., p. 32). This must not happen, Sorell thinks, and thus a looming emergency justifies extraordinary measures. There is a parallel in law as well. The constitutions of several nations allow for various exceptional measures in times of crisis, not necessarily crises generated only by antagonistic threats (Gross and N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in 2006).",

They lead their lives with their animals, especially pigs and ducks, very close. This way of life is extremely conducive to flu viruses mutating into new variants. These viruses cause yearly flu epidemics. Now, there is compelling evidence that a new, unusually contagious and highly pathogenic virus is emerging from the Farm People.

Two things might be noted, however: First, quarantine and other non-pharmaceutical interventions are probably not as effective as is sometimes thought, in particular not once the flu has begun spreading among the general population. Second, containment at the source \u2013 such as in the case of the Flu-Bug Hatchery \u2013 seems at least theoretically possible, using both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical means.

Such a specification would specify the threshold with reference to \u2018damage that would tend towards the destruction of the institution of morality itself\u2019 (Toner 2005, p. 559). On this view, a particular moral principle is not overridden, but temporarily suspended because of the commitment to the protection of moral principles in general. Toner believes that this is how Michael Walzer\u2019s version of the supreme emergency doctrine probably should be interpreted. I agree that this is a reasonable understanding of Walzer, who states that \u2018[a] supreme emergency exists when our deepest values and our collective survival are in imminent danger\u2019 (Walzer 2004, p. 33). This should probably be understood as saying that our deepest values are always at risk when our collective survival, understood as the survival of our community, is at stake. This goes with Walzer\u2019s explicit communitarianism: The destruction of our community is more than the destruction of a number of lives, even if that number is very large. \u2018When our community is threatened ... we face a loss that is greater than any we can imagine, except for the destruction of humanity itself. We face moral as well as physical extinction, the end of a way of life...\u2019 (ibid., p. 43).",

I am not sure what to make of the claim that utilitarianism, albeit of a certain kind, reimposes itself. Taken literally, the claim is downright mysterious. However, in the same paragraph Walzer explains that supreme emergencies are, however rare, situations when the negative value \u2018that we can\u2019t help assigning\u2019 to a looming disaster \u2018devalues morality itself\u2019. This gives us the liberty to do whatever is necessary to avert the disaster, the only constraint being that our action does not bring about an even worse disaster. However, according to Walzer, absolute deontological constraints can never be suspended. They remain in full force, but in supreme emergencies they may sometimes, and should sometimes, be overridden. This overriding \u2018leaves guilt behind\u2019 (ibid., p. 34).

Walzer puts the same point slightly differently when he writes that \u2018we can only be overwhelmed by supreme emergency\u2019 (Walzer 2004, p. 40). Presumably, it is an empirical psychological issue, and it is not obvious that everyone is as overwhelmed as Walzer supposes. Many of us do have strong intuitions that are consistent with Walzer\u2019s, but that is not sufficient in the present context. This leads us to the second point: The work Walzer wants those intuitions to do is to legitimise our doing \u2018whatever is militarily necessary\u2019. How this comes about is unclear, but, if I understand Walzer rightly, the Kantian dictum of ought implies can is central here. For if we cannot help imposing utilitarianism, then, by modus ponens, it is not the case that we ought to avoid utilitarianism. The third point concerns the one constraint Walzer allows, the requirement that our action does not bring about an even worse disaster. The only example he gives of such a disaster is \u2018the destruction of humanity itself\u2019 (Walzer 2004, p. 43). It seems like a sound requirement, but it is nevertheless problematic. For how are we to know that we do not bring about an even worse disaster by taking actions that are \u2018militarily necessary\u2019? Suppose that, contrary to the facts, the US\u2019 dropping of nuclear bombs on Japan in 1945 were military necessities in a situation of supreme emergency. The scientists responsible for the building of the bomb seriously considered whether the bomb might trigger a chain reaction affecting the entire atmosphere of the Earth. Their calculations led them to conclude that the possibility could be ruled out.9 But what if they were wrong? And how are we to know that we do not bring about an even worse catastrophe by attempting to avoid one, under license from the appeal to supreme emergency? The problem has been discussed at length in connection with the so-called precautionary principle and proposed measures to avoid potential environmental disasters.10 Situations of supreme emergency are typically ones of great urgency, disorder, and even chaos. It is likely that we will thus be less able to assess the consequences of our possible courses of action than in ordinary situations. This means that it will be very difficult to assess whether Walzer\u2019s constraint is fulfilled.",

Communities come and go, ways of life change for different reasons, without moral extinction occurring. The doctrine has the following counterintuitive consequences: Suppose that the survival of our community and thus \u2018our deepest values\u2019 is under threat. Let us also take it for granted that there is more than one community in the world. (Walzer seems to allow this, given his distinction between a community and humanity itself.)

They are (1) Last Resort, (2) Publicity, (3) Appeal to the International Community, (4) Right Intention, and (5) Reasonable Probability of Success. At least rules (1), (4) and (5) are recognisable as variants of rules from just-war theory, notably, from the ad bellum part of traditional just war theory. However, in just-war theory, the rules are explicitly moral, not prudential. The very reason for introducing rules of war is that prudential strategies in war leads to immoral acts being committed. In what follows, I will argue that Orend\u2019s rules are applicable in the non-antagonistic case. I will also argue that they are not best understood as prudential rules, but moral ones, despite Orend\u2019s claims to the contrary.",

As Orend is aware, situations conceived of as crises and emergencies are likely to be characterised by uncertainty, fear, and various forms of stress, including temporal stress. In such situations, decision-makers might of course overlook relevant options. This obviously holds for situations involving non-antagonistic emergencies as well. In fact, in many definitions of crises and emergencies used in the scholarly debate, they are defined as situations in which there is a threat to basic values and limited time for response (Stern 2003, p. 4\u20138).",

First, the problem from the last resort rule remains: If we can appeal to the Farm People through publicly declaring our intentions, or receive assistance from the international community, then we are not in a supreme emergency (yet). In fact rule two seems very much like a way of specifying rule one \u2013 both are ways of making sure that we do not resort to supreme emergency measures until we are in a supreme emergency. Second, and more importantly, the rules do not obviously promote efficacy, even as rules of thumb. In discussing appeal to the international community in the antagonistic case, Orend recognises this. The international community has all too often been slow and passive in its reactions to humanitarian emergencies. Examples include Former Yugoslavia and the Darfur region in Sudan. But, furthermore, public declarations can be counterproductive as well. In the example of the Flu Bug Hatchery, if given advance warning from public declarations, the Farm People might hide from the medical officers sent there to force-feed them antivirals, or flee in order to avoid isolation, thus speeding up the spread of the disease even more. It may be prudentially more efficient to keep quiet. And why should we limit our appeal to the international community? If there is someone else who is in a better position to help us, we should do so. It might be better to secretly appeal to a powerful neighbour or perhaps to our enemy\u2019s enemy (to use an antagonistic example) than to the international community. Prudentially, we should do what is efficacious, but that may often be contrary to what rules two and three prescribe.

This rule is perfectly reasonable, and it is equally applicable in non-antagonistic cases. If we are to survive, it is likely most efficacious to aim for survival.

This rule is \u2018absolutely vital\u2019, according to Orend (2006, p. 156). However, it cannot be absolutely vital from a prudential perspective, when we are in a supreme emergency. That we beforehand should look for measures that are likely to be successful when we are in a supreme emergency is true. Once we are there, however, things are different. Consider the Flu Bug Hatchery again. Suppose that we may choose between (a) doing nothing and face near-certain eradication in pandemic flu, and (b) force-feeding risky antivirals to the farm people. Suppose further that the antivirals are new and that their efficacy is questionable. The probability that they will stop the pandemic is very small; still, they are our best shot. Should we choose the do-nothing alternative, since the medical emergency measures do not have a reasonable probability of success? Or is any probability, however slight prudentially, reasonable in supreme emergencies? I am inclined to think so. If there are no other options, then we should, prudentially, grab for the last straw. Furthermore, given that we are in a struggle for survival with animal instincts kicking in, how could we do otherwise? Again, I believe that the allegedly prudential rule is best understood as a case of backdoor morality. Because interpreted as a moral rule, the rule makes sense. It would be morally unacceptable for us to expose the farm people to great risks in order to reduce the risk to ourselves very slightly. But I cannot see why it would not be the right thing to do prudentially.",

This principle is straightforwardly consequentialist. The same holds for the principle of reasonable probability of success. It can be justified if we adhere to an action-guiding consequentialist principle telling us to maximise the expected (i.e. probability-weighted) consequences. Let us assume that supreme emergency measures (e.g. draconian quarantine measures) are inherently bad. We further assume that those measures are commensurable with supreme emergency itself, and the former are less bad.
