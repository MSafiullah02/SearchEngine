Furthermore, to help with the screening of the A/H1N1pdm virus, rRT-PCR assays were developed also for detecting human seasonal A/H1N1influenza (A/H1N1) and A/H3N2 influenza (A/H3N2) viruses. These highly sensitive and specific rRT-PCR assays for detecting and subtyping A/H1N1pdm, seasonal A/H1N1, and seasonal A/H3N2 viruses will be useful not only for diagnosing influenza viruses, but also for the surveillance of influenza viruses.",

The nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal W software (Larkin et al., 2007). The sequence of the probe was modified slightly to match the HA gene of the recently circulating virus, and the redesigned probe was elongated (seven nucleotides longer than the former probe) to increase the melting temperature and thus improve the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Subtyping primers and probes for detecting human seasonal A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses were designed to correspond to each HA gene by comparing sequences posted over the past five years on the GISAID database. The type A typing primers and probe for detecting influenza A virus were designed previously to correspond to conserved regions of the matrix gene segment (Kageyama et al., in press). The rRT-PCR assay for detecting influenza A virus (Type A rRT-PCR assay) was used as a control for evaluating the new and improved rRT-PCR assays. The sequences and position of the primers and probes are listed in Table 1\n. The sequences of the primers and probes for Type A and H1pdm rRT-PCR assays are disclosed on the Global Influenza Programme website (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/swineflu/WHO_Diagnostic_RecommendationsH1N1_20090521.pdf).",

A/Aichi/472/2009 (H1N1)pdm was shown to have an HA gene in which the adenine nucleotide was substituted with a cytosine nucleotide at position 218 from the start codon located in the target region of the former probe (NIID-swH1 Probe1) (Kageyama et al., in press). A/Sakai/89/2009 (H1N1)pdm showed an HA gene in which the guanine nucleotide and the thymine nucleotide were substituted with adenine nucleotides at positions 208 and 210, respectively, located in the target region of the NIID-swH1 Probe 1. Since both viruses had mutation(s) in the probe-binding region of the HA gene, the sensitivity of the former H1pdm rRT-PCR assay decreased for these viruses (Table 4). However, the improved H1pdm rRT-PCR assay could detect these viruses with high sensitivity (Table 4).",

Type A rRT-PCR and improved H1pdm rRT-PCR assays, as well as the newly developed H1 rRT-PCR and H3 rRT-PCR assays used for subtyping human seasonal influenza A viruses, were shown to have good linearity (R\n2\n = 0.99) and high sensitivity (Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 and Fig. 1). No cross-reactivity or nonspecific reactions were observed in any of the assays performed using isolated viruses and clinical specimens. In the subtyping assay of clinical specimens, all 48 Type A-positive samples were subtyped by H1pdm, H1, and H3 rRT-PCR rRT-PCR assays developed in this study, and there were no unsubtyped Type A-positive samples. These results suggest that H1pdm, H1, H3, and Type A rRT-PCR assays are highly sensitive and specific for each target gene and thus should be of great use for detecting A/H1N1pdm virus and subtyping seasonal influenza A viruses.",

These two viruses were isolated from clinical specimens that failed to be detected by the former H1pdm rRT-PCR assay. The redesigned probe in this study was seven nucleotides longer than the former probe (Table 1). This was done to increase the melting temperature and thus to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. The results of the improved H1pdm rRT-PCR assay performed using serial dilutions of the A/Aichi/472/2009 (H1N1)pdm and A/Sakai/89/2009 (H1N1)pdm viruses demonstrated that the sensitivity of this assay was identical to that of the Type A rRT-PCR assay (Table 4 and Fig. 1), suggesting that the improved H1pdm rRT-PCR assay can detect mutated A/H1N1pdm viruses without losing sensitivity. Thus far, additional mutations of the target sequence of the redesigned probe used in H1pdm rRT-PCR assays have not been observed in recent circulating A/H1N1pdm viruses in Japan.",
