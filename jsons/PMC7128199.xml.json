Notably, all these changes in the veterinary sector have occurred after the unprecedented HPAI H5N1 outbreaks, which revealed the serious shortcomings of China's animal disease prevention and control system.5\n",

For example, after nationwide compulsory immunisation of domestic poultry against infection with H5N1 viruses since October, 2005,7 or avian influenza A H7N9 viruses since the second half of 2017,8 there have been a sharp reduction in H5N1 outbreak incidents in poultry7 and fewer H7N9 virus detections in poultry and environment samples, leading to a decrease in human infections.8, 9 Furthermore, a striking decrease in human rabies cases in China has been observed since 2004,1 which might be attributable to the comprehensive measures (requiring multisectoral collaboration between departments of agriculture, dog management, and health) adopted against this zoonotic disease, such as intensified rabies vaccination in dogs, controlling stray dogs, enhancing rabies virus surveillance in animals, and establishing a diagnostic laboratory for rabies, by the Ministry of Agriculture, in 2005. This laboratory was designated a World Organization for Animal Health Reference Laboratory in 2012. To boost the control of major animal diseases (eg, foot and mouth disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, hog cholera, Newcastle disease, brucellosis, echinococcosis, bovine tuberculosis, rabies, schistosomiasis, and avian influenza) China developed the first medium-term and long-term (2012\u201320) national plan for animal disease prevention and control in 2012.10 With sustained efforts by the veterinary sector, glanders and equine infectious anaemia have approached the elimination status. Notably, glanders (first described in China in the Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies [Zhu H\u00f2u B\u00e8i J\u00ed F\u0101ng] written over 1500 years ago) will probably be the first zoonosis to be eliminated in China. Additionally, controlling zoonotic diseases at the animal source to reduce the risk of their transmission to humans has increasingly become a predominant guideline in China's zoonosis prevention and control.",

Thus, their control situations are worrisome, although mandatory vaccinations of livestock against brucellosis and echinococcosis in the worst-affected areas of China have been required by China's compulsory immunisation plan against animal epidemics since 2016. Furthermore, in the past few months, human Streptococcus suis and anthrax infections transmitted from livestock, and the first emergence and rapid spread over more than ten provinces of China (by Nov 18, 2018) of the deadly African swine fever across hog herds, have caused great public concern over China's veterinary capacity for animal and zoonotic disease control and prevention. Indeed, it should be pointed out that the available veterinary services across China are insufficient for the demands of economic and social progress and development. Past development of China's veterinary services could not catch up with the ever-growing needs of veterinary medicine's role in protecting animal health, public health, food safety and security, and environmental and ecosystem health",
