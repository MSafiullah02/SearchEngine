            "text": "The Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) continues to be one of the most economically-impactful diseases in poultry despite intensive control (Jackwood, 2012). The virus affects mainly the respiratory tract, causing tracheal rales, sneezing, coughing, reduced weight gain and mortality, particularly in broiler chickens (Cook et al., 2012). The etiologic agent is a gamma coronavirus. IBV is an enveloped virus approximately 120 nm in diameter with a single-stranded, non-segmented, positive sense RNA genome. The RNA genome of 27.6 kb has at least 10 open reading frames (ORF), from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 are as follows: 5\u2032-1a-1b-S (S1,S2)-3a,b,c(E)-M-5a,b-N-Poly(A)-3\u2032. The genome encodes four main structural proteins (spike glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N)) and numerous non-structural proteins (Liu et al., 2009). The S1 spike glycoprotein carries virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific antigenic determinants, which can evolve rapidly especially within the three hypervariable regions (HVR) (Abro et al., 2012). Variations in the S1 protein have led to the emergence of numerous variants over time, some of which persist and spread, while others disappear after a short time. (Jackwood, 2012). Improving vaccination efficiency and the understanding of IBV evolution requires knowledge of the IBV variants in the region (Najafi et al., 2016). In Iran, several IBV genotypes have been reported; the first isolation of IBV in Iranian chicken flocks was reported in 1994 (Aghakhan et al., 1994). Later, several Iranian researchers identified the 793/B genotype (Seyfi Abad Shapouri et al., 2004). Genotypes of IBV strains isolated in Iran during 2014\u20132015 were classified into seven distinct phylogenetic groups (Massachusetts (Mass), 793/B, IS-1494, IS-720, QX, IR-1, and IR-2) (Najafi et al., 2016). Currently, Ma5, H120, and attenuated 793/B like IBV-based vaccination strategies are applied for IB control on poultry farms in Iran. Despite the use of vaccines, IBV still occurs in Iranian poultry farms. Vaccine failures are often associated with the emergence of antigenic variants that differ from the vaccine viruses (Huang and Wang, 2006), thus, continuous surveillance programs are necessary to control IB. The present study was conducted to evaluate the frequency of occurrence of different IBV genotypes circulating in Iranian poultry farms in the period 2015\u20132017.",

(Callison et al., 2006). The amplification reaction was performed using a nested PCR assay targeting the hypervariable region 3 of spike gene (393 bp) sequences on cDNA of all positive samples in Real-time PCR step. SX1 (5\u2032-CACCTAGAGGTTTGYTWGCATG-3\u2032) and SX2 (5\u2032-TCCACCTCTATAAACACCYTTAC-3\u2032) primer set were used in first reaction while SX3 (5\u2032-TAATACTGGYAATTTTTCAGATGG-3\u2032) and SX4 (5\u2032 AATACAGATTGCTTACAACCACC-3\u2032) primers were employed in the second round (Worthington et al., 2008). The cycling conditions for both first and second rounds of PCRs were an initial denaturation step at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min and 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 58 \u00b0C for 30 s, and polymerization at 72 \u00b0C for 30 s. We sent all positive samples for sequencing. The AccuPrep\u00ae PCR purification Kit (Bioneer Co., Korea) was used for the purification of the PCR products. Sequencing was performed with the primers (both directions) (Bioneer Co., Korea). Chromatograms were evaluated with CromasPro (CromasPro Version 1.5). After sequences editing, we did NCBI BLAST on the results and did primary identifications. In the following, we draw the phylogenetic tree. Because of the high number of sequences in tree (Data has not been shown), the identical sequences have been removed in each group and finally selected 51 sequences for drawing the final tree and submission in gene bank. Phylogenetic tree for the S1 glycoprotein was generated using the neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates to assign confidence levels to branches using MEGA 7 software package by Kimura-2-parameter model (Kumar et al., 2016). Sequences reported in this paper were added to the GenBank database under accession number (MF322802-MF322852).",

The distributions of different IBV genotypes expressed as a percentage of total IBV detected is shown in Table 1\n. The most frequently occurring type was IS-1494-like IBV with 70.34% frequency of occurrence rate; 793/B was the second most common type with 19.31% frequency of occurrence. The third and fourth most frequently detected IBV types were Massachusetts and QX with rates of 7.58% and 2.75% respectively (Fig. 3\n).

The highest frequently occurring of IBV was detected in Isfahan province (68.57%) and the lowest in Khuzestan province (39.39%).

Since then IS-1494-like IBV type was detected in Jordan, Turkey and other Middle East countries (Ganapathy et al., 2015). In Iran, IS-1494-like IBV was detected in 2010 for the first time and was reported as the second most frequently occurring IBV from 2010 to 2014 (Hosseini et al., 2015), thereafter it turned out to be the most dominant type in the molecular study done from 2014 to 2015 (Najafi et al., 2016). Based on the data, not only is IS-1494-like IBV type still the predominant IBV type, its appearance has remarkably increased up to two times more than that reported in the previous study (Najafi et al., 2016). Since the IS-1494-like IBV type vaccines are not used in Iran and because current vaccines and vaccination strategy do not protect completely against IS-1494-like, it is highly likely to become more widespread (Habibi et al., 2017).",

Mahmood et al. (2011) detected 793/B and Sul/01/09 type IBV strain in the North of Iraq (2008\u20132010) (Mahmood et al., 2011).

In another study from 2009 to 2014, the prevalence of 793/B, IS-1494-like, and Massachusetts genotypes were reported to be 63.7%, 21.2%, and 3%, respectively in Oman (Ganapathy et al., 2015).
