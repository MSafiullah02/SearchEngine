The use of mathematical models describing the effectiveness of a drug as a potent activator or inhibitor of specific enzyme has been given a growing attention for drug design in the last decade. Structure-specific properties that could be modeled using a mathematical equation is the key for fabrication of novel antiviral drugs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Ibrahim et al.,\n2012; Mostafa et al.,\n2014; Saleh et al.,\n2014).",

Those who made injections using unsterile or non-disposable needle or carried out blood transfusion before 1992 (the start of HCV blood screen tests) in the USA were subject to HCV infection (Das et al.,\n2011; Firpi and Nelson, 2007; Lemon et al.,\n2010; Yang et al.,\n2011). Hepatitis C virus is one of the major causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (Massariol et al., 2010). More than 200 million were infected by HCV worldwide with some countries such as Egypt having infection percentages over 14 % of the population. HCV is transmitted by blood-to-blood contact. This was the case for high percentage in Egypt where the focus was to invade the schistosomiasis using unsterile needles during 1980s\u20131990s (De Francesco et al.,\n2003; Lemon et al.,\n2010).",

These drugs worked in competition with the substrate of the viral enzyme (NS3 serine protease). In December 2013, FDA approved sofosbuvir for HCV treatment in combination with ribavirin with and without interferon (Asselah 2014). Different DAA drugs now are in clinical trials, and in the coming years one would expect to find different interferon-free drug formulations in order to avoid the adverse side effects of interferon (Asselah 2014; Beaulieu et al.,\n2011).",

The ability of nucleotides or NIs to interact with the polymerase active site can be predicted from its QSAR parameters. Table 1 shows the QSAR parameters for the activated (triphosphate) NIs (sofosbuvir, IDX-184, and R7128), their activated parent nucleotides (UTP, GTP, and CTP, respectively), and ribavirin. \n",

The UTP possesses the lowest log P (\u22122.185) implying higher water solubility which is important for the interaction that involved divalent cations in the active site of the polymerase and lowest final heat of formation (\u2212567.566 kcal/mol) which means higher stability. On the other hand, activated IDX-184 has the lowest total energy (\u2212190,434.6 kcal/mol) which indicates the stability of the drug, highest molar refractivity (97.136), and highest solvent-accessible surface area (440.056 \u01fa2) which all would help in increasing the interaction possibility with the two aspartic acids of the polymerase. Ribavirin in its active form has the highest dipole moment (65.378 debye) illustrating the reactivity of the compound used more than 20 years ago against HCV. It is very surprising that activated sofosbuvir (approved by FDA in December 2013) and R7128 both show no best values compared to all the active drugs and NTPs.",
