Its main work is to collect and analyze relevant information and data on the incidence of infectious diseases, and to explore the spatiotemporal transmission and epidemic laws of infectious diseases by using genomics, statistics and mathematical methods. It is indispensable to use mathematical methods to establish appropriate warning models in the early epidemic stage so that relevant departments can take timely response measures to prevent the development into a malignant state and reduce the degree of harm as far as possible. As recognized by the WHO, mathematical models, especially those that are timely, play a key role in informing evidence-based decisions by policy-makers (Morgan 2019).",

They used generalized additive models to identify and rank host-specific predictors of the number of total and zoonotic viruses in mammals. The model showed that bats are host to a significantly higher proportion of zoonoses than other mammalian orders (after controlling for reporting effort and the other predictor variables). Moreover, the phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people (Olival et al.2017).",

Comparing the sequence of the genomic sequence obtained with various mammalian coronavirus sequences suggests that bats may be a natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 (Paraskevis et al.2020; Zhou et al.2020), and Pangolins are potential intermediate hosts (Wong et al.2020; Zhang et al.2020).",

Firstly, they found that a majority of the viral reads (99.9% and 99.7% respectively for sample 1 and 2) were associated with coronaviruses and identified SARS-CoV-2 as the sole pathogen. The genome comparisons indicated that SARS-CoV-2 shared a 98.7% nucleotide identity with bat coronavirus strain BtCoV/4991 while it was quite divergent from SARS-CoV (79.7%). Furthermore, phylogenetic trees were reconstructed based on the nucleotide alignment of key viral genes by using the maximum likelihood method, employing a best fit substitution model and a SPR branch swapping algorithm. An understandable phylogeny showed SARS-CoV-2 has the most recent common ancestor with the neighboring bat coronaviruses, supporting the bat origin.",

            "text": "Another way to help identify the origin and evolutionary trends of viral hosts is to study codon usage bias given that the use of viral codons is subject to different selection pressures in different host environments. Ji et al. (2020) found that the codon usage bias of SARS-CoV-2 is most similar to that of snakes by using relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analyses. In fact, there are two levels of codon usage biases, one is at the amino acid level and the other is at the synonymous codon level. Amino acid composition can also introduce confounding effects if we only focus on the variation of synonymous codon usage. In order to overcome the above problem, another research team performed global correspondence analysis (CA), within-group correspondence analysis (WCA) and between-group correspondence analysis (BCA) among different genes in the coronavirus viral sequences (Gu et al.2020). The results showed that the SARS-CoV-2 had amino acid usage similar to bats, but the synonymous codon usages were relatively different, which indicated similar protein characteristics but maybe different evolutionary histories. However, these analytic approaches have not been used in studying viral sequences widely, so the information only provided some insights into wildlife reservoirs and that the further validation by animal model experiments is indispensable. Moreover, as a potential intermediated mammal, virus in civets share ~ 99.8% genome identity to SARS-CoV in humans. As the origin for SARS-CoV-2 is most possibly the bats, and we should also be concerned about other mammals, while are likely to be predicted as intermediate hosts.",

If more than one secondary case is produced for each primary case on average, the chain of transmission events within an outbreak is extended. The basic reproduction number (R0) is the most important index to measure and directly explain the level of virus transmission (Anderson et al.2004). It refers to the average number of people who will be infected with an infectious disease under natural conditions. Due to the facts that (1) the infected patients might die, (2) some patients may develop immunity after recovering, and (3) that the infected population is of a limited size, the R0 value will decrease with the decrease in the infected population, and the transmission speed is significantly reduced (Anderson et al.1992). Essentially, R0 determines how intensive a policy will need to be to control the epidemic, whereas both the generation time (Tg) and R0 determine the time available to implement suitably intensive controls.",

The nonlinear least square (NLS) framework has been adopted for data fitting and parameter estimation (Wallinga and Lipsitch 2007; Zhao et al.2019). Since the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear, many researches adopted the Tg information from SARS and MERS, which is similar to SARS-CoV-2. Zhao et al. (2020) reviewed the SARS-CoV-2 cases and suggests they might have been under-reported roughly from the 1st to the 15th of January 2020 because the number of cases appeared inconsistent with the following rapid growth of the epidemic curve since the 16th of January 2020. They modeled the epidemic curve of SARS-CoV-2 cases, in mainland China from December 1, 2019 to January 24, 2020 through the exponential growing Poisson process. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. As a result, they estimated the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49\u20132.63) and the number of unreported cases was 469 (95% CI: 403\u2013540). This study helped us understand what might be happening in the early stages of outbreak. Another algorithm estimated R0 using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with Gibbs sampling and a non-informative flat prior. Wu et al. estimated the R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was 2.68 (95% CI: 2.47\u20132.86) (Wu JT et al.2020a).",

They estimated that 75,815 individuals (95% CI: 37 304\u2013130,330) individuals had been infected in Wuhan city as of January 25, 2020. And then the SEIR model was extended into a SEIR-metapopulation model to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across mainland China. Given that public health professionals and the general public have realized the threats caused by virus, the transmissibility of the epidemic might be reduced compared with its nascent stage at Wuhan city. So they assumed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was reduced by 0%, 25%, and 50% after Wuhan city was quarantined on January 23, 2020 and the rate of transmissibility was similar across all cities. The estimated result was that if there was no reduction in transmissibility, the Wuhan city epidemic would peak around April of 2020, and local epidemics across cities in mainland China would lag by 1\u20132 weeks. A 50% reduction in transmissibility would push the R0 to 1.3, in which case the epidemic would grow slowly without peaking during the first half of 2020. These analytical data gave us an early warning that SARS-CoV-2 could be about to become an epidemic in the absence of mitigation on its present trajectory.",

The main idea is to calculate based on the data of infectious disease incidence over a long period of time and then establish an early warning line. By comparing the incidence data of a certain period with the early warning line, the epidemic trend of the disease can be judged and the risk of incidence can be estimated. However, this method can only be applied to the outbreak warning of existing infectious diseases. To substitute for it, a moving average prediction limit (MAPL) method was proposed, its standard deviation can be used to establish a prediction limit to predict the epidemic trend, so as to timely predict the epidemic risk grading in the affected area. The data has shown that the number of new cases in the whole country has been moving towards a faster decline zone in the 11 days after February 12, 2020 outside Hubei province, and stabilized near the prediction limit of the faster decline zone in the 5 days up to February 23, which is a low risk level. It indicates that after the nationwide anti-epidemic campaign, the epidemic situation in the country has been reduced as of the end of February. The overall trend of new suspected cases is consistent with the number of new confirmed cases. It is speculated that as long as the previous effective measures for outbreak prevention and control are adhered to, there is a great hope to keep the outbreak at a low risk level, and the risk of the epidemic in Hubei province in the future will be less serious. There is no doubt that understanding the real-time risk levels of the epidemic has a great guiding role in planning measures to gradually lift restrictions and restore normal economic production and social life.",

The estimated cCFR value was 5.3% when the index case onset date was fixed on December 8, 2019 and 8.4% when epidemic exponential growth occurred to fit the data with other model parameters. Although the cCFR of COVID-19 is not high compared to the 17% CFR of SARS in Hong Kong (Donnelly et al.2003; Ghani et al.2005) and 20% CFR of MERS in South Korea (Mizumoto et al.2015), the 5%\u20138% risk of death is by no means negligible given the overall scale of the ongoing epidemic.

Strict control measures are being implemented in densely populated and remote areas, including extended holidays, cancellation of crowd gatherings, calls for home isolation, and so on (Xiong and Yan 2020).

Furthermore, codon usage bias analysis provides us with another method and perspective to trace the source of the virus, although the results are still open to question. At the macro level, to solve the surveillance and detection problem, the next set of issues concern data capture, the development of diagnostic tests and treatment algorithms and the identification of public health measures to control the epidemic spread.

In other words, the key to establish a reliable model is to track the epidemic dynamics and release the clinical information and epidemiological data in a timely manner. However, official data is often uncertain because medical resources are limited. The available data only reports confirmed cases in hospitals and ignores infected people who do not have access to medical services. This makes it difficult to accurately predict the development of the epidemic. Secondly, we need to make it clear that fitting all factors into a model is not easy and models are often built on strong assumptions so the data estimated by the model may be biased in some cases. In this case, simple public health measures are unlikely to be effective, and other measures are needed, such as tighter restrictions on movement, greater availability of antivirals drugs and expanded vaccine development and production facilities. These questions suggest that there is still much room for improvement in rapid risk assessment and accurate early warning of emerging infectious diseases. It is clearly in everyone\u2019s interest to greatly enhance global surveillance capabilities, especially in developing regions, and concomitantly to improve basic training in infectious disease and molecular epidemiology.",
