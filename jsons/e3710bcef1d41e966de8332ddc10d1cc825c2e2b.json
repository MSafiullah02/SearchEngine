My mother, sister and her family members, brother (also an obstetrician-gynecologist) and his wife, as well as some of my best friends live in Italy. I understood from them and Italian news, loud and clear, how bad COVID-19 was for humans, and for pregnant women, early on.",

I also want to thank Elsevier, in particular Andrea Bocelli, Donna Stroud, and Brian Arnold, without whom these manuscripts would not have been promptly processed, and the information would have been too old to help us all early in this quest to save lives.",

            "text": "These early manuscripts highlight the importance of proper personal protective equipment (PPE) for everyone, both healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients, both in outpatient and inpatient settings, and of testing asymptomatic pregnant women presenting for care. 1e3 They offer guidance on how to decrease patient-HCW interactions and still provide essential obstetrical and maternal-fetal medicine care both in outpatient 4 and inpatient settings, including labor and delivery (L&D). 5 They report the first meta-analysis of coronavirus pregnancy cases including COVID-19 cases from China. 6 We thank our New York-area colleagues for sharing some of their early experience that warned us about the possibility of critical COVID-19 infection developing quickly in asymptomatic women presenting to L&D. 2 In the largest-still small-series (n\u00bc43) published so far of pregnant women in the United States who received a diagnosis of COVID-19, 37 (86%) had mild, 4 (9.3%) severe, and 2 (4.7%) critical disease 3 ; these percentages are similar to those described for nonpregnant adults with COVID-19 (about 80% mild, 15% severe, and 5% critical disease), based on the COVID-19 disease severity characteristics described by Wu and McGoogan. 9 Although this is reassuring, obstetrical providers should be cognizant of possible quick progression from asymptomatic admission to transfer to the intensive care unit for respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation, 2 as well as cardiomyopathy, in pregnant women with COVID-19. 7 The possibility of needing extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) has been discussed in the care of pregnant women with COVID-19: we thank the authors of the meta-analysis of ECMO use in pregnancy, a timely subject. 8 UpToDate has published their free guidance on COVID-19 in pregnancy. Dr Manuck, AJOG MFM associate editor, helped develop a dedicated website, , with invaluable information for both providers and pregnant women. A US registry has started (), which will soon provide information about the management and outcomes on hundreds of pregnant women in the United States with COVID-19. There is no need to panic. I feel this is what we'll talk about with our grandchildren, like my grandfather and father (I miss him!) talked to me about the World War-II and the Americans coming to save Italy. Help is co Q3 ming this time too, guidance will continue to evolve, and AJOG MFM is glad to be in a position to offer some of this precious assistance. There's a large group of obgyn moms (in a Facebook group of 1500ish) talking about you and how much they appreciate your guidance. They wanted you to know this ... tell him we know he's trying to save lives. We hear him. We are scared. All leadership he can offer is welcome. 113  114  115  116  117  118  119  120  121  122  123  124  125  126  127  128  129  130  131  132  133  134  135  136  137  138  139  140  141  142  143  144  145  146  147  148  149  150  151  152  153  154  155  156  157  158  159  160  161  162  163  164  165  166  167  168  169   170  171  172  173  174  175  176  177  178  179  180  181  182  183  184  185  186  187  188  189  190  191  192  193  194  195  196  197  198  199  200  201  202  203  204  205  206  207  208  209  210  211  212  213  214  215  216  217  218  219  220  221  222  223  224  225  226 ",
