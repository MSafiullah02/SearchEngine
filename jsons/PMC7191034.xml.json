Besides producing food and stimulating rural community development, the CAP defines one more condition that allows farmers to fulfill their functions in society\u2014environmentally sustainable farming\u2014to produce food while simultaneously protecting nature and safeguarding biodiversity (European Commission, 2020a). Cross-compliance is a CAP's mechanism that links direct payments to compliance by farmers with basic standards concerning the environment, food safety, animal and plant health and animal welfare, as well as the requirement of maintaining land in good agricultural and environmental condition (GAEC). Evidence has shown that agriculture is the single largest cause of biodiversity loss but already nearly one-third of the world's farms have adopted more environmentally friendly practices while continuing to be productive (Pretty et al., 2018). In Europe, since 2005, all EU farmers receiving direct payments under CAP are subject to compulsory cross-compliance which is an important tool for integrating environmental requirements into the CAP (European Commission, 2020b). The good GAECs and the statutory management requirements (SMR), refer to a set of EU standards and requirements aiming at sustainable agriculture (European Parliament, 2013). In the area \u201cEnvironment, climate change, good agricultural condition of land,\u201d when referring to the issue of \u201cLandscape, minimum level of maintenance,\u201d GAEC 7 requires \u201cRetention of landscape features, including where appropriate, hedges, ponds, ditches, trees in line, in group or isolated, field margins and terraces, and including a ban on cutting hedges and trees during the bird breeding and rearing season and, as an option, measures for avoiding invasive plant species\u201d (European Parliament, 2013). After they are defined and detailed at national or regional level, all these standards are to be respected by all the European farmers receiving direct payments or some of the rural development payments.",

Overgrazing leads to the invasion of ruderal plant species, later on categorized as \u201cunwanted\u201d weed species by APIA. From the phytosociological point of view, two of the 10 species, i.e. E. cyparissias and R. acetosella, are natural components of most of the grasslands in the vegetation classes Festuco\u2013Brometea (E. cyparissias) and Molinio\u2013Arrhenatheretea (R. acetosella) (Sanda et al., 2008; Chifu, 2014), and they were erroneously categorized as unwanted vegetation in APIA's guide (Agency for Payments and Intervention in Agriculture, 2019a). Moreover, some of the other 10 species are not the most common and widespread species of their genus in Romania, e.g. Carduus acanthoides invades many more hectares of degraded grasslands than C. nutans (Sarateanu et al., 2008). All the above considered, the APIA's documents with respect to the invasive and unwanted vegetation should be critically reviewed and updated for the future post-2020 CAP.",

In Greece, A. lappa's root is used for musculoskeletal diseases, in particular against joint pains and rheumatism (Tsioutsiou et al., 2019). In Bosnia and Herzegovina this plant is used to treat skin conditions, to strengthen the hair root, against intestinal parasites, for dissolution of kidney stone, for improved urination, against diabetes and rabies, dog's bites, to release stomach gasses, against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and to treat facial nerve inflammation etc. (Redzic, 2010).",

These two groups possess high antioxidant activity (Liu et al., 2012). Arctigenin is reducing the inflammatory process through inhibiting iNOS expression and promoting cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) productions (Zhao et al., 2009). In vitro studies show that lignans extracted from A. lappa have anti-proliferative effect against cancerous cells, inducing apoptosis and limiting migration of metastasis (Lou et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019).",

Despite its poisonous nature, C. maculatum is included in several herbals as Succus conii, described as a narcotic, sedative, analgesic, spasmolytic, anti-aphrodisiac, and anti-cancer agent (Reynolds, 2005). C. maculatum extract is used as a traditional homeopathic remedy for cervix carcinoma (Mondal et al., 2014). This species has been used in ethnomedicine as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent (De Landoni and Conium maculatum, 1990; Arihan et al., 2009; Al-Snafi, 2016,; Madaan and Kumar, 2012), in Turkey to treat diabetes (Paksoy et al., 2016), and in Morocco as an alternative to treat typhoid fever and sterility, and also to ease labor (Kharchoufa et al., 2018). Externally, it has been used to treat herpes and swelled joints (Bloch, 2001). Some studies highlight the antispasmodic property of C. maculatum and it was reported to have a positive impact on patients with epilepsy, asthma, angina, rheumatism, and tetanus (Mitich, 1998; Hotti and Rischer, 2017).",

The increasing demand for herbals and the limited supply of many species that are harvested from the wild (Coghlan et al., 2015) is stimulating the economically-motivated adulteration (EMA) (Simmler et al., 2018). It was recently reported that 27% of almost 6,000 commercial herbal products sold in 37 countries were found to be adulterated, while in Europe almost half (47%) were adulterated. In Romania, 94% of the herbal products analyzed (n = 70) were reported to be adulterated, when their composition was compared with the labeled ingredient species (Ichim, 2019). The availability of new plant biomass while is removed from the Romanian meadows by its owners or farmers can become readily available to the interested users and could reduce the pressure on the existing sources of raw materials. Moreover, because only selected species have to be searched, identified and removed, a supplementary quality check is added to the plant raw material, before being further used or processed, which represents additional benefits for the quality of the herbal products and their benefits for the human health.",

For these unwanted meadow weeds have reported many and various uses in Romanian ethnomedicine, as well as in other nine neighboring East European countries. Some of the ethnopharmacological uses are highly relevant for the modern medicine, supporting the use of the removed biomass from the meadows as additional or alternative source of pharmacologically active ingredients. The local communities and the industry of herbal food supplements can take immediate advantage from these raw plant materials, readily and easily available, while assuring their environmentally-friendly, sustainable, and supportive of local traditions and commercial use.",
