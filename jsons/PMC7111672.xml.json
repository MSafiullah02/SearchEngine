            "text": "The 1997 Asian financial crisis (AFC) and the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) have attracted substantial attention in at least three areas: causes (Eichengreen, 2008, Mishkin, 2000, Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008), effects (Chirathivat and Malikamas, 2010, Click and Plummer, 2005), and remedies (Brunnermeier and Oehmke, 2012, Krugman, 2009). The second area has been investigated from national and regional perspectives (Baig and Goldfajn, 1999, Glick and Spiegel, 2010, Hasan, 2002, Ho, 2011). Table 1\nreports quarterly variations in the stock market indices and current account balances of four Southeast/East Asian countries/areas (henceforth countries) and the U.S. during financial crises. These include Thailand, Malaysia, the Republic of China (Taiwan for short), Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong for short), and the U.S. which are included in the study for different reasons. Thailand was the first nation to feel the effects of the AFC (Chokesirikuchai et al., 2013, Hoontrakul, 2008, Jiranyakul, 2009); Malaysia was the second country affected during the crisis but adopted a different strategy to combat the AFC crisis (Hussin et al., 2012, Md-Yusuf and Abd Rahman, 2013, Rahman et al., 2009); Taiwan (Chou et al., 1999, Kung and Wong, 2009, Tsai and Dean, 2009) and Hong Kong (Jao, 2001, Yu and Tam, 2007) escaped heavy losses; and the U.S. was the originator of the GFC (Roubini & Mihm, 2010). Changes in macroeconomic variables during the AFC and GFC are significant. They form the basis of this study.",

One channel is inadequate risk management (Dwyer and Tkac, 2009, Hellwig, 2008), and another is business cycle movement (Barro & Urs\u00faa, 2009). The third channel highlights the wealth effect in monetary policy (Ludvigson et al., 2002, Mishkin, 2013). In theory, a high level of wealth should lead to a higher level of consumption and ultimately promote higher levels of aggregate income (Fair, 1971, Starr-McCluer, 1998). The effects of changes in wealth have been studied, i.e., a change in wealth holdings leads to a change in consumption, thereby generating a change in income (Stevans, 2004). Would personal consumption expenditure actively affect a stock index and the current account in a general equilibrium-framework in the presence of financial crises? This issue has yet to be examined in depth. During unexpected financial crises, what are the relationships between three macroeconomic policy variables, namely, personal consumption expenditure, the exchange rate, and the interest rate, and two state variables, namely, a stock market index and the nation's current account balance? The purpose of this study is to explore these relationships to shed some light on this area.",

            "text": "A brief discussion of studies of financial crises, stock market indices, and current accounts is presented below. Mishkin (2000) identifies three causes of the 1997 AFC: speculative funds, an unsophisticated market structure, and a weak regulatory environment. Click and Plummer (2005) in addressing the equity market integration issue in the ASEAN-5 nations following the 1997 AFC, conclude that co-integration exists. Regarding the 2008 GFC, Eichengreen (2008) considers the reasons for crises in numerous countries, excluding the U.S., to be the time required to effectively respond, a lack of government actions, and a limited policy choice set. Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) compare 18 historical financial crises in industrialized nations and claim that such crises are related to international capital flows and the country's current account balance.",

This implies that an increase in the change in the foreign exchange rate can mildly attenuate the change in the SET index. The exchange rate acts as a stabilizer for the stock index. Prior to June 1997, the Thai currency traded at 24.534 baht per US dollar. When the 1997 AFC struck Thailand, the Thai exchange rate was 35.256 in 1997Q3. The central bank's intervention failed, as the rate increased to 44.309 in the fourth quarter. Moreover, the SET decreased by 14 percent from the second to the third quarter of 1997 and declined by 22 percent from the third to the fourth quarter, as the central bank decided to abandon its policy of intervening in the foreign exchange market. The effect of the December 2004 Tsunami in West Indonesia and Thailand on the Thai tourist industry is reflected in both the exchange rate and the unemployment rate. The exchange rate stood at 39.1835 per U.S. dollar in 2004Q4 but had reached 39.5935 by 2005Q1. The national unemployment rate was 1.46 percent but had increased to 2.36 percent over the same period. During the 2008 GFC the exchange rate increased from 31.404 in 2008Q1 to 35.737 one year later, and fell to 33.204 in 2009Q4. Our result disagrees with that obtained by Jiranyakul (2009), that the 1997 AFC had no influence on SET stock prices, but agrees with the findings of Chirathivat and Malikamas (2010), Chokesirikuchai et al.

By excluding Hong Kong, it is reasonable to suggest that the one-quarter lagged change in the money supply has a mild influence on a contemporaneous change in the current account balance. The U.S. money growth rate changed from being positive in all quarters in 2008 to negative in the second and third quarters of 2009, while the current account deficit improved substantially in 2009. For instance, this deficit was \u2212US$177 billion in 2008Q1 but \u221298.5 billion one year later. A change in the U.S. money supply reduces the contemporaneous change in the U.S. current account balance.",

The ranking of the countries with respect to magnitude, in descending order is as follows: Hong Kong, Malaysia, the U.S., Thailand, and Taiwan. These figures are relatively higher than the estimates for the other variables with one exception in Thailand. We will briefly discuss the case of Hong Kong. In 1997, Hong Kong reported HK$798 billion (US$104 billion) in consumption expenditures, a current account balance of negative HK$47 billion, and HK$706 billion in foreign currency reserves. One year later, consumption expenditures decreased by 4.5 percent, the current account increased by 147 percent, and currency reserves declined by 3.4 percent. During the 2008 GFC, personal consumption expenditures fell by 0.6 percent from 2008 to 2009, the current account decreased by 39 percent, and foreign currency reserves increased by 38 percent. Reduced exports and a constant foreign exchange rate contributed to the substantial change in the current account balance. In the case of Hong Kong, a change in consumption expenditures served as a destabilizing factor with respect to a change in the current account.",

The year 2009 is selected for two reasons: it is the second year of the global crisis, and the impact of the crisis had already been felt in many countries. In the U.S., mortgage-based derivatives collapsed when massive numbers of homeowners defaulted on their mortgage payments. In April 2007, the New Century Financial Company declared bankruptcy, the Ameriquest Mortgage Corporation fell in August 2007, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 in September 2008, and the Federal Reserve Banks extended loans valued at 85 billion dollars to American International Group in September 2008. In February 2009, the U.S. President Barack Obama signed a fiscal stimulus package into law (Krugman, 2009, Roubini and Mihm, 2010). The effect of U.S. mortgage derivatives on Taiwanese banks and investors is exemplified by the securities issued by the Private Equity Management Group Inc. (PEMG) controlled by Danny Pang. In 2009, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit against PEMG (Tsai & Dean, 2009). The contributions of three policy variables to the two state variables are reported in Table 7\n.",

Row 2 reports the product of \u03bb\n2 and the one-period lagged change in the exchange rate shown in equation 7. For Thailand, only .04 percent of the average stock index change of 79.77 can be attributed to the one-period lagged change in the exchange rate. Malaysia fared better, with a negative .37 percent of the change in the KLCI index being attributable to the one-period lagged change in the exchange rate. The results for the countries indicate a contribution of less than one percent. For the U.S., changes in the exchange rate exhibit an inverse relationship with changes in the DJIA index number, but this change is of insignificant magnitude. This result suggests that changes in consumption expenditures contribute much less than changes in the interest or exchange rated with respect to changes in stock market indices during 2009.",

For example, when a change in the exchange rate in Thailand generated a shock, the standard error of the change in the SET stock index moved in a sequence: \u22120.1 in the beginning, \u22120.3 in the third quarter, positive 0.2 in the next two quarters, and zero in the 16th quarter.
