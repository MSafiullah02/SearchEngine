However, in general, the hospital population shows heterogeneity\u2014patients may be grouped based on sex, age, clinical specialty, severity of illness, given treatments; spatial and/or personnel cohorting may be applied. Second, the movement of each individual staff member within a ward or an intensive care unit cannot generally be considered as random\u2014e.g. the health-care workers may carry out ward rounds on a regular basis and in a set pattern. Third, the transmission rate, as defined by Eq. (1), is a state variable and, as a result, it does not explicitly include the role of individual behaviour in the transmission process. As a result, the individual properties, such as the status or the actions of each agent, cannot be properly represented in this kind of modelling approach.",

The DMC method has an absolute estimation error that decreases with N\n\u22121/2, where N is the number of simulation runs. The typical number of simulation runs performed is between 25 and 100. A discrete approximation (spatial and time discretization) is applied to the dynamics of the system. The temporal evolution of the system is taken into account by using two parameters: the time step and the time scale. The time step is set to 15 min. The time scale is the maximum time interval during which the system evolves. In this study, a time scale of 3 months is chosen.",
