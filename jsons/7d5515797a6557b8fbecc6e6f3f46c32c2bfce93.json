One particularly promising setting for this could be triage: in Italy, tents have been mounted outside the hospital as \"field hospitals\" to avoid contact between infected patients and noninfected ones. Providing every tent with an US scanner could permit early diagnosis outside the hospital, effectively implementing a \"US triage.\"",

Furthermore, the risk in transporting unstable hypoxemic patients, and associated nosocomial transmission, further limits chest CT utilization.",
