Whilst awareness of the importance of public health legal preparedness has grown since the anthrax attacks in the USA and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, there has been relatively little study of the practical use of public health detention in recent times.1 In Ireland, a power to detain and isolate individuals who are \u2018a probable source of infection\u2019 is provided under Section 38 of the Health Act 1947 (as amended).2, 3, 4 The power may only be applied where it is impracticable to isolate the individual in their home. The detention process would typically be instigated by the treating physician making a request of a director of public health (DPH), the senior public health doctor at regional level, who has discretion to issue a detention order. There is no requirement for notice or for a judicial hearing. Detention continues until the DPH certifies that the individual is no longer \u2018a probable source of infection\u2019. Under existing regulations, the power is available for 11 diseases.5 Although only tuberculosis (TB) is of daily relevance, the power would apply in public health emergencies such as pandemic influenza or viral haemorrhagic fevers.",

This approach has recently been adopted in England and Wales where powers had been limited, as in Ireland, to removal to, and detention in, hospital.28 In addition to the absence of legal powers governing DOTS, the current study suggests that, as a practical reality, access to DOTS in Ireland is currently inadequate.

In the case of a psychiatric patient who challenged the failure to release him when the mental illness which had resulted in his detention had resolved, the ECtHR held that the responsible authority must have a measure of discretion in deciding whether immediate and absolute discharge is appropriate in light of \u2018all the relevant circumstances\u2019. Furthermore, the ECtHR held that the responsible authority could make the release subject to conditions and maintain a measure of supervision.36 The potential for relapse of non-compliance and the emergence of untreatable, drug-resistant TB are surely \u2018relevant circumstances\u2019 which may be taken into account in planning discharge. Detention beyond infectiousness was introduced in New York in the context of the MDR TB outbreak in the 1990s and has also been applied in Canada.37, 38\n",

Although the section had only been used once during the study period (Department of Health and Children, Dublin, personal communication), most treating physicians have made reference to the possible exercise of the power. This strategy was regarded by them as being successful in achieving compliance in most of those cases. Several respondents were anxious to highlight that the threat of detention was never employed in isolation from other facilitatory approaches, and that it is several steps along an escalating hierarchy of engagement. Thus, it is difficult to assess how instrumental the threat of detention is in actually achieving compliance. Similarly, the means by which it may achieve compliance are open to question; for some, it may do so through its coercive effect, whereas for others, it may serve to crystallize their appreciation of the significance of their diagnosis and the importance of completing treatment.",

This is certainly the case where the physician knowingly misrepresents the possibility of formal detention, e.g. where he knows the legal grounds for detention do not exist.

Although doctors are entitled to rely on a legal presumption of mental capacity, that presumption is rebuttable.40, 41 Given the association between non-compliance and a variety of factors which may give rise to doubts about the patient's decision-making capacity (Table 1), it is a very real possibility that many patients admitted for isolation may lack legal capacity. In the absence of procedural safeguards, their isolation in hospital may violate the ECHR. In the Bournewood decision, the ECtHR found that there was a deprivation of liberty where medical staff exercised \u2018complete and effective control\u2019 over the care and movements of an autistic man who lacked mental capacity and was admitted to hospital informally.42 An attempt to justify the deprivation of liberty on the grounds of necessity, which had succeeded in the House of Lords, was rejected. The ECtHR held that the doctrine of necessity afforded insufficient procedural safeguards to protect against arbitrary deprivations of liberty, and thus violated Article 5(1). Formalized procedures for dealing with such patients were introduced in England and Wales in response to that decision.43 The so-called \u2018Bournewood gap\u2019 remains unaddressed in Irish law, leaving open the potential for liability.",

It is undoubtedly true that the issues touched on here are complex and that the nature of the study does not allow the nuances of these issues to be reflected completely. Nonetheless, it is clear that there are significant concerns with respect to both the practical and legislative facilitation of the work of public health. While the community deserves to be protected from exposure to dangerous infectious diseases through the reckless indifference of others, individuals should only be detained as a last resort and with meaningful safeguards of their fundamental rights. As Teigen has observed, \u2018public health legislation is simultaneously instrumental and symbolic\u2019.44 The professional community which bears the responsibility for managing infectious diseases is entitled to a clear democratic mandate for the work which it performs on behalf of society, and to protection from personal liability where it performs those tasks reasonably and in good faith. Thus, reform of public health law to reflect modern human rights standards and modern medical knowledge should be an urgent priority.",
