Based on the outbreak of (Coronavirus Disease 2019, COVID-19) sweeping the world, the authors claimed to have been able to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthesized clones of the (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) with a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform. This paper presents the genetic reconstruction of diverse RNA viruses, including the novel coronavirus. The authors believe that with the use of this platform, generation of SARS-CoV-2 from chemically synthesized DNA could bypass the limited availability of virus isolates to allow genetic modifications and functional characterization of individual genes, as well as to generate serological diagnostics, to develop and assess antivirals and vaccines, and to establish appropriate in vivo models. During this critical period of global research and emerging combat with this epidemic disease, the present research could contribute to the development of antiviral therapeutics and that of a vaccine.",

The convention and the relevant laws and regulations draw a red line for dual-use biotechnology research, to ensure \u201cmorality of duty\u201d2\n[4], and also to serve as the bottom line for the development of biological science. Second, dual-use biotechnology must promote scientific independent innovation while ensuring the protection of social safety. The two basic values of safety/security and intellectual freedom of research must be considered evenly. Therefore, countries all over the world are promoting biotechnological innovation while stressing equally on the importance of biosafety and biosecurity legislation. To reduce the predictable risks caused by the dual-use of biotechnology as much as possible, it is necessary to take the following into consideration before development of any high-risk technology: (1) Whether it is essential to undertake the research and to undertake it now? Whether there exist other alternative technologies, as in, whether it is necessary and urgent? (2) Whether and how to undertake the implementation of mandatory safety/security measures? (3) Whether and how to compulsorily certify the technology? (4) Whether and how to educate and train researchers? (5) Whether and how to investigate the reliability of the researchers? (6) Whether and how to oversee the publication and propagation of the research results? How to answer the above questions on the basis of balancing the value of safety/security and intellectual freedom, and risk assessment, depends on which subjects own the biosafety/biosecurity regulation rights, and depends on which standard technique and behavioral norm to carry out.",

On the right side of the axis, government agencies often lack professional judgment on rapidly changing biotechnology; they may overemphasize the value of social safety/security and their strict adherence to formal norms is not beneficial for flexible case-by-case decision-making. However, in the case of the independent regulatory agencies, consisting of scientists, ethicists, jurists, and government regulators, due to the diversity of their decision-making members, they are able to undertake a comprehensive review of the process of knowledge acquisition from the perspectives of science, economy, politics, and law, and balance the value between social safety/security and technological development.",

In 2011, Ron Fouchier of Erasmus Medical Center, the Netherlands, and Yoshihiro Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA, separately performed the genetic alteration of the H5N1 virus, which was found to be easily transmissible between ferrets through the air. Fouchier claimed that it was \u201cprobably one of the most dangerous viruses you can make\u201d [5]. Regarding this, scientists and critics believed that this highly transmissible virus could cause a huge risk to human beings if it was accidently leaked or was misused by bioterrorists [5]. In 2014, the U.S. Government instituted a pause on funding for any new studies that included certain gain-of-function experiments involving influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses, and encouraged those currently conducting this type of work to voluntarily pause their research while the risks and benefits were being reassessed by the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) and the National Research Council (NRC) [6].",

            "text": "From the perspective of responsible development of biotechnology, regarding to the risk assessment of a highly dangerous virus like SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to clarify the items of risk assessment. For instance, whether the yeast-based synthetic genome method in the paper is irreplaceable in the development of therapeutics or a vaccine? If there are alternative safe methods to develop a vaccine and select therapeutics with recombinant DNA technology, such as recombinant viral protein, production of a pseudovirus, or transfection with mRNA fragments of viral structure proteins, why should such a huge risk be undertaken? Especially, the risk of this virus reconstruction technique (transformation-associated recombination, TAR) is in the production of not only the novel coronavirus, but also other dangerous RNA viruses, such as other coronaviruses and the Zika virus (ZIKV). Faced with the situation where other laboratories or universities (such as the University of North Carolina) are also trying to create a copy of the virus from scratch [7], how can we ensure that this technology is not misused or abused in the future? For such technologies, which can be easily applied or converted to risk, the risk of publication needs to be strictly assessed, for example, whether to publish, to which group of people, and under what circumstances could the research be published? In addition, how should we compare and quantify which groups will benefit and which groups will undertake the risk, and what is the criterion of determination? Whether scientists have enough expertise and intelligence to fully assess the dual-use risks of a synthesized virus (including the assessment of the motivation, condition, and capability of bioterrorists to acquire SARS-CoV-2 or to design and synthesize it) [3]54? Once the risks become a reality, who or which organization should take responsibility for them? Whether it is sufficient to deal with and resolve the risk only depending on the \u201cresponsibility after the event\u201d? Furthermore, the ratio of benefits to risks is not only a scientific issue, but also involves differences in risk perception and value judgment of different subjects; the views about the risks involved often differ between the experts and the public. Then, which subject's risk sense should be taken into consideration in the prior ethical review and for the determination of the value balance between social safety/security and biotechnological innovation?",

We believe that research transparency and public participation are very important in the research of pathogen synthesis technology. Scientists and regulators should cooperate with the public and other stakeholders to encourage dialogue with the public to address key issues, such as public acceptability. Although scientific research requires a spirit of freedom and autonomy, for such dual-use biotechnology with a high-risk potential, no single scientist and scientific community can undertake the responsibility, once the risks materialize into real dangers. For that reason, in addition to enhancing the \u201cself-government\u201d and self-discipline of scientists and scientific communities, government supervision must be reinforced, laws and regulations should be improved, and global regulation framework ought to be constructed. Therefore, we appeal to scientists to be highly prudent and responsible while undertaking the research and development involving pathogen synthesis technologies. We share the same earth, interests, risks, and destiny and therefore, we are supposed to assume equal responsibility to protect our world. The whole world should join hands and overcome the challenge posed by this novel virus together. Only through joint participation and effective regulation can we guide dual-use technologies like engineering SARS-CoV-2 to benefit human society.",
