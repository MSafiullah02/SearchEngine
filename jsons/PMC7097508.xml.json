            "text": "The primary cellular targets of the calcineurin inhibitors are immunophilins. Ciclosporin A binds to cyclophilins, and tacrolimus (also known as FK506) binds to FK binding proteins (FKBPs); both events result in a profound inhibition of the phosphatase activity of calcineurin. Immunophilin-dependent signal transduction via calcineurin represents a key event in the activation of T-cell proliferation by regulating expression of the gene that encodes IL-2 (Figure 1a). Apart from their role in calcineurin signalling, immunophilins are catalysts of protein folding and as such have a supportive role in viral infection. Viruses, including HIV, herpes simplex virus, vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and coronaviruses, take advantage of immunophilins for their replication, and this virus\u2013host interaction is inhibited by ciclosporin A.9,10 Moreover, cyclophilin A can actually incorporate itself into these viral particles.9,11 For HCV, it is well established that cyclophilins have an essential role in viral replication and de novo virus production. Early studies suggest that HCV replication is dependent on the interaction between cyclophilin B and nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B, HCV RNA polymerase) to stimulate its RNA binding activity and thereby promote the de novo synthesis of positive and negative stranded RNA.12,13 Ciclosporin A blocks the binding of cyclophilin B to NS5B RNA and thereby inhibits viral replication.12,13,14 Cyclophilin A also directly interacts with NS5B15 and is involved in modulating the polyprotein cleavage activity of NS2.16 In addition, cyclophilin A interacts with NS5A and stimulates its binding with HCV RNA.15,17",

Hirano  et al.28 suggested that tacrolimus, but not ciclosporin A, interferes with interferon signal transduction. However, a later study did not confirm this suggestion, instead demonstrating in two state-of-the-art cell culture models that tacrolimus does not interfere with either interferon signalling or the antiviral activity of interferon.29 Therefore, no further mechanistic understanding has been unveiled on this issue.",

One of the few established experimental animal models to study HCV infection is the SCID/uPA (severe combined immunodeficient, urokinase plasminogen activator transgenic) mouse engrafted with primary human hepatocytes. A study published in 2011 by the group that pioneered the development of this mouse model has attempted to define the effect of ciclosporin A and tacrolimus on serum HCV titres and antiviral interferon therapy in vivo.31 Although no statistically significant differences were observed between ciclosporin A and tacrolimus either on HCV viral titres or the efficacy of interferon therapy, effects could have been masked by some technical limitations. Firstly, the baseline HCV titres differed between the tested groups, with a trend toward higher baseline HCV RNA levels in the ciclosporin A arms than in the tacrolimus arms. Secondly, the antiviral response to interferon in this model was much less robust than that observed in patients. Moreover, models in immunodeficient mice cannot evaluate indirect effects of immunosuppressive drugs on antiviral immune responses unless one of the latest immunocompetent mouse models is used.32",

Three cyclophilin inhibitors are currently being evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies: Debio-025, NIM811 and SCY-635.33 These compounds are developed by structural modifications of ciclosporin A to enhance the antiviral activity and reduce the immunosuppression capacity by increasing cyclophilin binding and abolishing calcineurin affinity, respectively. Debio-025 has been the first to enter clinical trials and the first results are encouraging. In a cohort infected with HCV and HIV, 2 weeks of treatment with Debio-025 decreased HCV viral load by more than 3-log, including in patients infected with HCV genotypes 1, 3 and 4. By contrast, the anti-HIV effects were much less pronounced (1-log reduction of viral load).34 In treatment-naive patients infected with just HCV, treatment with Debio-025 alone resulted in a more than 2-log reduction of viral load in those with genotypes 1 and 4, and a more than 4-log reduction in those with genotypes 2 and 3.35 When combined with PEG-IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin, additive antiviral effects were demonstrated.35",

            "text": "Glucocorticosteroids have been used since the early years of organ transplantation. Prednisolone and its close analogue dexamethasone are potent suppressors of the immune system, as they modulate cellular and inflammatory responses via stimulation or inhibition of gene transcription (Figure 1).36 Although evidence indicates that the oestrogen receptor is functionally involved in HCV replication by promoting NS5B association with the viral replication complex,37 the role of other glucocorticosteroid receptors is largely unknown. A study using the HCV subgenomic replicon model38 found that both prednisolone and dexamethasone have no stimulatory effects on RNA levels, but rather have minor inhibitory effects.39 Using an infectious HCV model (the JFH1-derived chimera Jc1 in Huh-7.5 cells), similar results were obtained showing \u223c50% inhibition of viral replication at high doses of prednisolone.40 However, in this infectious model, prednisolone stimulated HCV infection by enhancing virus entry.40 This specific enhancement was mechanistically linked to the upregulation of the two essential HCV entry factors\u2014occludin and scavenger receptor class B type I\u2014at both mRNA and protein levels.40 On the basis of their observations, the authors speculated that treatment with a steroid bolus (>250 mg prednisolone per day) in patients with HCV might foster virus dissemination through facilitation of virus entry into hepatocytes, thus aggravating HCV recurrence. Moreover, treatment with prednisolone probably suppresses the patient's immune control of the HCV-infected cells, by effects on T cells41 and plasmacytoid dendritic cells,42 and thereby might indirectly accentuate infection.39 Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are of particular interest in HCV infection, as they produce large amounts of IFN-\u03b1; however, the capability of plasmacytoid dendritic cells to produce IFN-\u03b1 seems to be reduced in patients with chronic HCV.43 Experimental data from our group have shown that treatment with prednisolone abolishes the anti-HCV activity of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in vitro (P. E. de Ruiter, personal communication).",

The glucocorticosteroid receptor and type I interferon receptor signalling pathways share the cofactor glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1).54,55 Glucocorticosteroids suppress interferon responses by antagonizing the heterotrimeric STAT1\u2013STAT2\u2013IRF9 (ISGF3) activity via GRIP156 or attenuation of STAT1 activation through induction of SOCS1, which is a suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (Figure 1).57 However, these events probably differ between cell types and no direct link between these molecular interactions and viral infection has been well established.

Inhibition of IMPDH decreases intracellular levels of guanosine nucleotide pools resulting in inadequate quantities for nominal DNA duplication, which was thought to be the antiproliferative and immunosuppressive mechanism of MPA (Figure 2a).64 This mechanism is probably also responsible for its antiviral effects against at least the West Nile,23 yellow fever61 and Chikungunya viruses,62 as supplementation by exogenous guanosine almost completely overcomes these inhibitory effects. By contrast, supplementation of guanosine had little effect on the inhibition of HCV replication.23,65 Consistently, ectopic expression of IMPDH2 mutants lacking the binding site for MPA largely restored its antiproliferative effect, but with only minor effects on HCV replication, suggesting other mechanisms are involved in its anti-HCV action.66 Unexpectedly, MPA was found to induce the expression of important antiviral interferon-stimulated genes in HCV cell culture models, including interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 1, IRF9 and interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3).66 Using an RNAi-based loss-of-function approach, IRF1 was demonstrated to be directly involved in the anti-HCV activity of MPA.66",

Results from prospective nonrandomized or retrospective studies remain controversial at this point of time. However, the in vivo efficacy of many antiviral compounds (such as ribavirin) can be observed only when combined with other antivirals. Ribavirin has shown substantial anti-HCV activity in vitro but is generally considered to have little or no detectable antiviral activity as a monotherapy in patients.70 However, when combined with IFN-\u03b1, ribavirin increases the sustained virologic response by threefold.71 Similarly, a previous clinical study showed that combined treatment with MMF and PEG-IFN-\u03b1 in patients with chronic HCV resulted in a considerably improved end-of-therapy response rate in a difficult-to-treat population of previous nonresponders to standard therapy.72 The sustained virologic response of the IFN-\u03b1 and MMF combination group, however, was lower than that of the group treated with IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin.72 A possible explanation for these limited sustained virologic responses is that MMF interferes with a robust antiviral immune response required to eliminate HCV.23 Notably, MPA works in synergy with IFN-\u03b1 on HCV replication in vitro.23 When combined with IFN-\u03b1, MPA augments the transcription of multiple interferon-stimulated genes that are mediated by interferon-stimulated response elements.66 These latest findings have shed some light on the molecular basis of how MPA works in synergy with IFN-\u03b1.",

Autophagy is a process for catabolising organelles and other cytoplasmic components to balance cellular metabolism and to promote cell survival during stressful conditions. Autophagy is also an important event in regulation of the cellular response against viral infections.74 The role of autophagy is complex and can have both antiviral and proviral effects in different virus infections. During infection, autophagy can be a surveillance mechanism that delivers viral antigens to endosomal compartments to stimulate innate immune signalling and to provide processed antigens for presentation in the major histocompatibility complex. Virus infection can trigger the induction of autophagy, but can also block the function of the autophagy pathway or even subvert autophagy. By contrast, viruses can directly exploit the autophagy machinery to facilitate replication or to promote their maturation and the dissemination of virions.75",

The use of a recently developed infectious culture model has revealed the negative effects of steroids, specifically on HCV entry.40 However, a common question from transplant clinicians is why these clear in vitro effects of HCV are not univocally observed in clinical practice. For instance, the clear antiviral activity of ciclosporin A and MPA in vitro is yet to be confirmed in proper prospective clinical studies, and retrospective data sketch a murky picture. One probable answer to this in vivo and in vitro discrepancy is that tampering of the host immune system against the virus masks the direct antiviral effects of these immunosuppressive agents. The antiviral potency of particular immunosuppressants might not be strong enough to result in a dramatic effect on viral load, but could potentially be reflected in other parameters, such as slowing down fibrosis progression.95,96,97,98 Perhaps the potent effects of the derivates of ciclosporin A, such as Debio-025, in patients were achieved by both deprivation of immunosuppressive properties and enhancement of cyclophilin binding affinity.34,35",

As a caution, a phase I study found that telaprevir interferes with the metabolism of both ciclosporin A and tacrolimus by inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A enzymatic activity.99 Telaprevir caused a tremendous increase in blood concentrations of both these calcineurin inhibitors and could potentially lead to serious or even life-threatening adverse effects.

The effectiveness of interferon-based antiviral therapy is reduced after transplantation, but, to date, no concrete evidence from HCV culture models that immunosuppressive drugs interfere with interferon signal transduction exists. Immunosuppressive medication for transplant recipients who have HCV should be further improved.

The uptake of MPA by cells involves organic anion transporting polypeptides and probably other transporters as well. MPA is an uncompetitive inhibitor of IMPDH and results in the inhibition of de novo nucleotide biosynthesis. Insufficient intracellular levels of guanosine nucleotide pools result in a defect of nominal DNA duplication that is thought to be the immunosuppressive mechanism of MPA. In hepatocytes, persistent attenuation of nucleotide biosynthesis by MPA partially contributes to the inhibition of HCV replication. In addition to this IMPDH-dependent antiviral pathway, MPA also conveys a rapid antiviral effect mediated by induction of the expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Through an unknown mechanism, MPA directly potentiates the activity of the ISRE promoter element both in the presence or absence of IFN-\u03b1 stimulation. Rapamycin engages the cytosolic protein FKBP12 to form a complex. This complex inhibits the mTOR pathway by directly binding to the mTORC1, resulting in blockage of cell cycle progression at the G1 to S phase and thereby causing inhibition of T-cell proliferation. Rapamycin is a potent autophagy inducer, which facilitates HCV infection. The mTOR pathway directly interacts with interferon-activated JAK\u2013STAT signalling.
