How do we answer the questions \u201cWhy me?\u201d and \u201cWhy now?\u201d when we are diagnosed with disease? How do we paint what we know is there but cannot see? Modern medicine, like much pre-Impressionistic art, tried to square this circle by instituting a technical and professional gaze that filters out the ephemera of the individual in order to identify and name what is hidden by opaque bodies (see, of course, Foucault 1994). But this was not Cubism\u2019s aim; it was not a reductive attempt to discover the building blocks common to all landscapes or buildings or humans or musical instruments.

As Fairchild et al. note:Contemporary decisions about whether to reveal the identity of those with disease who posed a public health threat have turned on assessments of the risk to the community. In Texas, in response to a 1993 investigation of a case of fatal hantavirus, state health officials refused to disclose the name of an infected individual to the local media. A 1999 case of meningitis in a Maryland school was not sufficient for the County\u2019s Director of Community and Environmental Health to identify the student by name. The official, however, suggested that had more people been at risk for contracting the disease, it may have been deemed appropriate to identify the infected student by name, even over the objections of her parents. Such criteria were met in the case of SARS. In the 2003 outbreak in Toronto, the names of the first two cases, a mother and son, were released to the press for the purpose of identifying and advising people who might have had contact with them (Fairchild et al. 2007, 10).\n",

While Ebola was initially viewed (and also disregarded) in the same way\u2014as an African phenomenon\u2014this has very rapidly changed as individuals \u201ccloser to home\u201d have become infected. Moreover, Ebola and HIV are different. Although both are viruses spread via bodily fluids (and neither is very durable outside the human body), \u201cEbola is transmitted when a person is sick, usually very sick, and you have to come into direct contact with bodily fluids. So it\u2019s difficult not to know you\u2019re exposed\u201d (Anthony Fauci cited in Siegel 2014, \u00b615). Those with HIV, on the other hand, may remain symptomless but infectious for years, making it much harder to identify and combat infection. Treatments also vary; where one is acute and relies on \u201cgood supportive care and the patient\u2019s immune response\u201d (CDC 2014, \u00b65), the other is ongoing and requires multiple, expensive antiretrovirals.",
