As a result, the presence of C. spp. in deep respiratory specimens is rarely taken into account. However, Corynebacteria, especially pseudodiphteriticum and striatum species, can cause clinically relevant infections in humans. Indeed, this is suggested by a multitude of case-series reporting Corynebacteria-related conditions, such as lower respiratory tract infections [2, 3], endocarditis [4], keratitis or endophthalmitis [5], urinary tract, or wound infections [6]. The pathogenicity of Corynebacteria isolated in respiratory specimens has been further suggested in small series [6\u20138], most often with severe underlying cardiac or respiratory comorbidities [6, 9\u201311]. Although the switch between commensalism and pathogenicity is poorly understood, virulence factors, as well as environmental factors, may play a role in this process [12].",

Microbiological methods to identify pathogens of CAP, HAP and VAP were established according to the recent American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America criteria and the European Manual of Clinical Microbiology [13, 17, 18]. The threshold values used to define significant quantitative cultures were \u2265 104 CFU/mL for B-BAL and \u2265 103 CFU/mL for NB-PTC, respectively. Endotracheal aspirates or sputum examinations were not considered. Virus or fungi were not studied as co-pathogen. All bacteria, except coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Enterococcus spp., were considered if they were isolated at a concentration above the threshold value. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and interpreted using the disk diffusion method according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines [19]. In the absence of diameter breakpoints specific for Corynebacteria (amoxicillin, piperacillin, imipenem, erythromycin), clinical categorization was made according to non-species-related breakpoints recommended by the antibiogram committee of the French Society for Microbiology (CA-SFM) [20]. The definition of the Intermediate category used in this article is the one that applied before 2019: (1) a level of antimicrobial activity associated with uncertain therapeutic effect. It implies that an infection due to the isolate, (2) may be appropriately treated in body sites where the drugs are physiologically concentrated or (3) when a high dosage of drug can be used; it also indicates, (4) a buffer zone that should prevent small, uncontrolled, technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretations [20].

Indeed, impaired airway protection, decreased lung clearance, damaged lung structure, antibiotic exposure, primary immunocompromised conditions or acquired immunodeficiency after a prolonged stay in ICU, are all conditions that can be encountered in ICU, and that may promote the onset of C. spp. pneumonia.",

The role of C. spp. colonization in the causal relationship with VAP, or as a simple surrogate of the immune paralysis associated with acute illness, is speculative. Herein, it is very difficult to assess the clinical relevance of these putative infections. Interestingly, Llitjos et al. have recently highlighted that a first episode of pneumonia promotes the onset of further episodes, due to initial lung damages [21]. However, we chose not to consider viral co-infections to discriminate the proper role of C. spp., and as the impact of viral pneumonia, due to viruses such as Herpes Simplex or Cytomegalovirus is highly debatable in critically ill patients [22]. Moreover, isolation of viruses requires B-BAL, which was rarely performed because NB-PTC is the historical technique of choice in our institution [23].",

This is in accordance with the reported susceptibility of C. spp. in the literature, as most of these bacteria are commonly considered sensitive to \u00df-lactam, aminoglycosides and glycopeptides agents, and resistant to macrolides, clindamycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones and/or rifampicin [7, 8, 10, 24]. In our cohort, only one isolate was resistant to vancomycin and linezolid and one third of isolates were resistant to cefotaxime. Resistance to cefotaxime may be here explained by the prior exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics and the high potential of microorganisms to select drug-resistant strains in ICU. However, some species, including C. jeikeium, C. macginleyi and C. xerosis are resistant to \u00df-lactam and require glycopeptides; C. propinquum and C. striatum are inconsistently sensitive to penicillin and cephalosporins. Thus, profiles of antimicrobial sensitivity of C. spp. are considered unpredictable [10, 24, 25] and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has been increasingly reported so far [12, 26]. In addition, Campanile et al. reported 36 multidrug-resistant strains of C. striatum strongly associated with devices such as tracheal tubes or catheters [26]. Overall, these data might advocate for a short empirical treatment with vancomycin or linezolid as soon as C. spp. is isolated from respiratory specimens with clinical feature consistent with severe pneumonia. This antimicrobial therapy should then be tailored based on species identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing results.",

The respective parts of direct attributable responsibility of C. spp., or the absence of antimicrobial therapy in patients who had probable C. spp. pneumonia but who were left specifically untreated, remains to be elucidated. No conclusion can be drawn about the association between C. spp. and patient outcome, because of the small number of patients, the specific weight of comorbidities, and the absence of control population. Underlying comorbidities may have a stronger impact on outcome that the pneumonia itself, as suggested by the analysis of causes of death, as well as the delay between C. spp. pneumonia and death.",

Classification of clinical relevance into probable, possible or unlikely was independently evaluated by independent investigators. There were blinded to each other, limiting classification bias with only three patients classified by consensus due to different assessments. We used only quantitative cultures of specimens obtained with invasive diagnostic techniques, to avoid contamination from the upper respiratory tract. These data can be helpful for critical care physicians challenged by a C. spp. positive deep respiratory specimen in a setting of pneumonia. Although it remains controversial whether a respiratory sample with C. spp. isolated beyond a significant threshold should be regarded as a mere colonization, our findings reinforce the belief that C. spp. should be considered as a possible pathogen.",

            "text": "Our study presents several limitations. As in all previous studies on the clinical relevance of C. spp., data were analyzed retrospectively and the small number of isolates prevents from performing statistical analysis. For the same reason, we were not able to evaluate the clinical response of treating these infections: even if it seems justified to treat C. spp. when its impact is high in a setting of pneumonia, this strategy does not seem to lower mortality, probably due to the overall morbidity of the patients. The low incidence of C. spp. isolation also prevents from performing prospective studies. The clinical diagnosis of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients remains challenging and controversial and we acknowledge that despite reaching consensus, some cases may have been debatable. In addition, we chose to classify the clinical features of pneumonia as probable, possible or unlikely, as thresholds may not be always as clear as infection or colonization. As developed in others fields of critical care medicine [27], this classification allows a \u201cgrey zone\u201d approach, which is closer from the real life. The small number of patients has restricted the statistical analysis and precluded assessment of risk factors of infection. Moreover, the majority of the patients had co-infections and received complete antibiotic courses covering C. spp. isolates, even when the latter may have not been considered as a causative pathogen by clinicians. In addition, the fact that half of the samples containing C.spp. were not considered or treated, outlines the difficulties to assess and manage these patients. Finally, as the MALDI-TOF has only been implemented since 2015 in our institution, we were not able to identify all the Corynebacteria subspecies. In our cohort, we were not able to describe potential temporal trends in C. spp. antimicrobial sensitivity, due to the low number of strains.",
