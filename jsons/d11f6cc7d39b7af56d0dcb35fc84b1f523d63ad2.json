We evaluated the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV immunization and infection and did not observe high ALT levels in ferrets after vaccination with inactivated SARS-CoV or after live virus challenge. This difference may be due to several factors, such as the specific viral strain used, titer of virus challenge, strength of the immune response, specific response to the spike protein, use of female ferrets, or the presence or absence of vaccinia virus components. More experiments are needed to settle these apparent differences.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 94, "end": 98, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 211, "end": 215, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 216, "end": 219, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 357, "end": 360, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 548, "end": 551, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In our study, lung lesions were mild to minimal in severity and were focal.

The worst lesion was in the lungs of a ferret in the mock vaccine group, consistent with virus-associated, not vaccine-associated, disease. Lesions found in some ferrets included the bronchiolar hyperplasia and perivascular cuffing often found in monkeys and mice with experimental SARS-CoV infection and a lesion not usually reported-focal hepatic inflammation, which was minimal.

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been observed during FIP-CoV infection [7] and may be part of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection. Disease associated with SARS-CoV infection results from immune-mediated infiltration of the airways by lymphocytes and macrophages. Enhanced disease should be marked by increased viral titer after prior exposure to the virus or virus components. In the case of FIP, the virus gains entry into macrophage cells via neutralizing antibodies to the spike envelope protein, which bind the virus and are internalized by the cell. Macrophages have been shown to be virally infected in patients with SARS, and the concern is that these macrophages provide an additional host substrate in which the virus may grow. Furthermore, early and more robust seroconversion has been associated with more severe disease in patients with SARS, implicating SARS as an immune-mediated disease [25] . If SARS-CoV gains entry to macrophages through antibodies, then vaccines that elicit these responses may not be safe. We purposely designed a weak vaccine that elicited a mild antibody response to test the possibility that low antibody titers are associated with enhanced pulmonary disease as opposed to a strong antibody response, which should be completely protective. We did not see an increase in viral titer in vaccinated ferrets versus mock-vaccinated ferrets, and the vaccine did not induce ADE. This suggests that, under these conditions, an inactivated whole-virus vaccine can provide some measure of protection without the risk of enhanced lung or liver disease. Still needed are kinetic studies to show that infected ferrets are protected from further infection in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the role played by the level of the immune response in ADE needs to be analyzed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 166, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 997, "end": 1001, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Several animal models have shown promise for use in the evaluation of SARS antivirals, vaccine safety, and efficacy.
