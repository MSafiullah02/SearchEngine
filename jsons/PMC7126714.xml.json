            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), with a large infectious RNA genome (27.6 kb), belongs to the family Coronaviridae, the group 3 Coronavirus. The RNA molecule of the IBV is linear, single-stranded, positive sense and possesses a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 poly-A tail. IBVs can replicate in respiratory, alimentary and urogenital tracts in chickens of all ages, resulting in great economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003). Clinical signs associated with respiratory and enteric tracts and renal damage might be found in infected chickens (Cavanagh, 2007). During infection, IBV possesses a unique discontinuous transcription system, i.e. a nested set of 3\u2032 co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs sharing a common leader sequence in the 5\u2032 end are transcribed in the presence of negative-stranded RNA intermediates. The viral polymerase \u201cjumping\u201d possibly contributes to the high RNA recombination frequency in coronaviruses (Lai, 1992, Lai and Holmes, 2001).",

            "text": "The IBV genome encodes four structural proteins: spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E; also known as sM), membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N) (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003). The spike glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit anchors onto the viral outer membrane using the S2 subunit to form a club-shaped projection on the mature virion (Cavanagh, 1983). The S1 glycoprotein is involved in cell attachment and carries epitopes for serotype-specific hemagglutination-inhibition and virus-neutralization antibodies (Cavanagh and Davis, 1986, Hodgson et al., 2004, Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2005, Koch et al., 1990). The S2 glycoprotein, in which two antigenic determinants were identified (Koch et al., 1990), may possess different secondary structures that affect the S1 specific antibody binding (Callison et al., 1999). The membrane glycoprotein is associated with virus assembling and budding (Lai and Holmes, 2001). The nucleocapsid protein interacts with genomic RNA to form the viral nucleocapsid, playing a role in viral RNA synthesis and cell immunity (Lai and Holmes, 2001). In addition, four non-structural proteins of unknown function are expressed by the polycistronic genes, gene 3 and 5 (Britton et al., 2006). Virus mutants carrying truncated 3b genes demonstrate increased virulence and growth advantages in vitro and in ovo (Shen et al., 2003). The open reading frames (ORFs) of 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b encode accessory proteins not essential for IBV replication (Casais et al., 2005, Hodgson et al., 2006, Youn et al., 2005).",

            "text": "As a signature of avian coronaviruses, IBV strains are continuously evolving through point mutations and recombination of their genomes. Those variants have better adaptation or increased virulence advantageous to IB outbreaks. To date, a large number of IBV sero- or genotypes have been identified worldwide (Cavanagh, 2007). Most molecular epidemiologic studies have focused on the spike glycoprotein gene. (Bochkov et al., 2006, Dolz et al., 2006, Dolz et al., 2008, Jackwood et al., 2007). It was reported that slight sequence differences in the S1 gene probably lead to poor cross-protection (Cavanagh et al., 1997). Viruses of different types can co-circulate within a region (Capua et al., 1999, Liu et al., 2006), raising the inter-strain RNA recombination frequency (Bochkov et al., 2007, Jia et al., 1995, Lee and Jackwood, 2000). The wide use of live virus vaccine may also critically contribute to the genetic evolution of IBVs by acting as a heterologous RNA donor template (Kusters et al., 1990, Wang et al., 1993). The emergence of viral variants has complicated disease control requiring persistent IBV molecular surveys.",

There were originally two IBV genotypes (TW-I and TW-II) circulating in the field (Liu et al., 2003, Wang and Tsai, 1996) until genetic variants 2992/02 (Huang et al., 2004) and 3374/05 emerged. Both variants showed a high S1 gene homology with the proventriculus pathogenic strains J1, Q2, T3, CK/CH/LDL/97I and CK/CH/LDL/98I, belonging to the China genotype VII (Liu et al., 2006, Yu et al., 2001). The 3\u2032 6.8 kb gene of CK/CH/LDL/97I was used as a putative parental strain. Mass type viruses have been widely used as vaccine strains in Taiwan. Our primary concern was the possible viral recombination resulting from the co-circulation of heterologous vaccine strains in flocks. The consecutive sequence of 3\u2032 7.3 kb genome in strain H120 was obtained first in this study and served as another putative parental strain. To our surprise, six local strains experienced crossover events with the strain CK/CH/LDL/97I instead of H120. Thus, inter-strain recombination events had occurred between the IBVs from Taiwan and China. Taiwan and China are geographically separate. Neither live poultry nor processed poultry products from China have been allowed to import into Taiwan for years. How those recombinants arose remains unknown. A recently identified IBV isolate in Korea (Kr/D64/05) also revealed a close relationship to the China CK/CH/LDL/97I-type strains (Lee et al., 2008). Furthermore, the appearance of the China-like strains in Taiwan is reminiscent of the spread of the China QXIBV strain in European countries (Beato et al., 2005, Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2006). In this case, it could be speculated that migrating birds provide the genetic sources of IBV variants in Taiwan. A chicken-nephropathogenic IBV strain was identified from a non-diseased teal (Anas sp.) in China (Liu et al., 2005). Thus, the transport of IBVs over long distances by other avian species appears to be possible (Cavanagh, 2005). However, we still cannot overlook illegal trafficking or unapproved vaccine use in the field.",

In this study, however, nearly all of the strains showed nephropathogenicity (lesions of kidney) in chickens, rather than the proventricular lesions caused by the CK/CH/LDL/97I-type strains. How a variant with a chimeric genome arrangement from heterologous strains demonstrates its tissue tropism or pathogenicity in a host is not clear. In addition, it was found that chicks challenged with virulent CK/CH/LDL/97I were incompletely protected by commercial vaccines and other heterologous strains (Liu et al., 2007).

In addition, the CTTTTG sequence was observed adjacent to the putative recombinant junction (Brooks et al., 2004, Wang et al., 1993). In this study, T-rich motifs (A/T/G)TTTTG, consensus among a recombinant and its parental strains, were located upstream of several crossover sites. For instance, the motifs were found in the S2 gene of the 3263/04, the 3b gene of the 2575/98, and the IG region of the 2992/02 and 3468/07. All of the recombinants experienced crossover events in the 3\u2032 end of the S gene, indicating a possible region for template switching in viral RNA synthesis. Similar results were obtained from the IBV strain CU-T2 and Cal99, whose recombination sites were deduced in the 3\u2032 751 and 700 nucleotide of the S gene, respectively (Jia et al., 1995, Mondal and Cardona, 2007).",
