Efficient transport systems enable economies to develop optimal allocation of scarce resources, thereby maximizing wealth while securing the smooth operation of society at-large. In addition to its vital economic role, the transport sector carries indispensable social responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis labor conditions, public health, and consequently, sustainable development.",

This combined movement has an ultimate impact on the juxtaposition of various species of oftentimes disparate ecosystems. While humans build road networks, tunnels, bridges, ports, railways, ferries, and supersonic planes that form effective means to traverse natural barriers to species spread, they often accelerate and even facilitate disease movement from one area to another. Mass processing and wide distribution networks further allow for the amplification and extensive dissemination of potential human microbes. Particularly in marginalized areas, transport milieux are highly conducive to risk-laden behavioral patterns and are Chapter 8",

Wide geopolitical turmoil and subsequent demographic shifts in volatile regions along with the breakdown of public-health structures and environmental and ecological upheavals have contributed to an upsurge of pre-existing and the advent of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. This \"anomaly\" in the epidemiological transition poses additional threats to both the transport sector and humans, as wide dissemination of infectious pathogens remains an unintended but enormous consequence of transport. Within this context, this chapter places the transport sector firmly within the discourse of epidemiology and demography, and critically reviews its far-reaching role in the diffusion of diseaseprimarily of sexually transmitted (STIs) and bloodborne (BBIs) infections and secondarily of tuberculosis (TB), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, and malaria. While all transport modes are reviewed, the chapter places particular emphasis on the trucking and maritime sectors in developing regions and presents new findings on trucking in the United States.",

Within this context, transport functions as an intervening variable with the potential to affect both, by either hampering or accelerating growth that ultimately influences health. The transport sector-which physically moves humans, animals, goods, and services between different geographies-employs millions of workers, generates revenues, and consumes materials and services produced by other economic sectors. Not only does it provide vital links between centers of production and consumption, but the existence of adequate transport infrastructure and the provision of transport services are indispensable for the normal functioning of economic and sociocultural life and to the development of nations. Aggregate data indicate that the transport sector accounts for 5.3% of GDP in low-income and 6.8% in middle-income countries, while it ranges between 8-10% in the industrialized nations of North America and the European Union (EU) (BTS, 2006; EU, 2006) .",

Overall, the transport sector has been linked with a multitude of airborne, foodborne, waterborne, bloodborne, and zoonotic disease risks (i.e., SARS, TB, malaria, avian influenza, STIs/HIV) (CDC, 2006) . The inherent occupational risks of the transport sector render its workers as well as the populations they come into contact with particularly vulnerable to aquiring and spreading disease. Thus the dissemination of infectious diseases has far-reaching and complex implications not only for the transport sector but also for all sectors of economy and society. Transport appears to be the most affected economic sector in developing regions and as a result, STI/HIV outbreaks and epidemics have become serious barriers to development (World Bank, 2006) . Transport corridors, stopping places, and terminal points have proven to constitute prime vectors for STIs/HIV and associated risks (CSIR, 2004) . These settings bring together transport services and construction and maintenance workers in temporary establishments where the absence of stable social networks is demonstrated with prevalent sexual multipartnering among non-regular partners (ILO, 2003) . With about 80-90% of passengers and freight transported by road in East and Southern Africa, data show that mobility increases not only travelers' own STI/HIV risks but also that of their partners at home and of sexual partners encountered along transport corridors and at transport hubs (ILO, 2005b) . Along Polish and Lithuanian borders, 42% of interviewed truckers reported engaging in commercial sex, 33% of whom without condoms (Kulis, Chawla, Kozierkiewicz, & Subata, 2004) , and at about the same time, 50-fold HIV increases were recorded after the completion of the Kunming-Nanning highway in China (UNDP, 2001) . In South Africa, 22% of transport workers were forecast to die of AIDS within five years while enormous economic impacts were anticipated, while in Thailand, HIV/AIDS related costs to the trucking sector were expected to surpass US$15 million just in 2000 (FHI, 2002) . Despite the fact that railway tracks run along major road corridors in several African nations and Indian provinces, very limited research is available on the potential role of railways in disease spread.",

Just as severe malnutrition and multiple bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections have been predominant forces behind the unparalleled HIV epidemic-characterized by high prevalences, rapid spread, and uneven distribution and endemicity-the road sector has also consistently rendered populations highly vulnerable to STIs/HIV, TB, malaria, and other opportunistic infections (Caldwell, Caldwell, Anarfi, Ntozi, Orubuloye, Marck, Cosford, Colombo, & Hollings, 1999) . The distribution of labor demand resulting in labor migration and family social structuring (IOM, 2003) has brought about prevalent multipartner sexual mixing and networking (Williams et al., 2002) . Consequently, these and other factors have led to the current situation in SSA, which accounts for 60% of all HIV/AIDS cases in the world and the highest adult HIV/AIDS prevalence rates, estimated at 7.4% (UNAIDS, 2006) . Southeast Asia (SEA) 1 constitutes an equally large and diverse geographic area, where large population segments live in areas of pervasive poverty and maldevelopment (ADB, 2006) . Equally pervasive is population mobility as internal (rural to urban) migration is gradually increasing with overall movement patterns involving high proportions of temporary migrants, and migration flows including significant numbers of youth and women (Guest, 1999) . These \"floating\" populations, in search mainly of work, are highly vulnerable and oftentimes operate as bridges to the general population similar to other people at-risk (i.e., sexworkers, trafficked women, IDUs). Within such contexts, SEA is a collage of mini-epidemics displaying a considerable variation in scope and intensity. At the end of 2003, although adult HIV prevalences were estimated to be at most 0.9%, 4.1-9.6 million adults and children were living with HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, 2006) . India alone is second to South Africa in terms of the overall number of people living with HIV/AIDS, which was estimated to be about 5.1 million at the end of 2003 (UNAIDS, 2005) . Epidemics in this region remain largely concentrated among intravenous drug-users (IDUs), men who have sex with men (MSM), sexworkers and their clients, and the sexual partners of all these population segments (UNAIDS, 2006) .",

In India, truckers engage consistently with large numbers of non-regular and usually commercial sex partners; in fact, they can have anywhere from 40-400 sex partners a year, depending on how much time and money they have on their hands (Synergy Project, 2002) . In several predominantly Muslim SSA countries, quasi-polygamous patterns have been noted among truckers who have \"serial\" wives along their routes (Synergy Project, 2002) , while others have \"road wives\" with whom they stay when traveling in certain directions (ILO, 2005) . Commercial sexworkers are only part of the far-reaching sexual networks that exist at trucking-related hotspots. Both men and women who live and work around these settlements often have other regular sexual partners (in addition to their husbands and wives), while some trucker wives, who are left behind for months at a time, have other sexual partners of their own. Moreover, truckers frequently offer rides in exchange for sexual favors to itinerant market women traveling with their goods. Truck routes, therefore, operate as transmission settings that facilitate the travel of HIV from high-to low-prevalence areas along with trucks (Apostolopoulos, n.d.) .",

While as South American nations with the highest HIV rates, HIV prevalences in Argentina and Brazil range around .5-.6%, infection levels among IDUs reach 60% in urban Brazilian centers and surpass 24% in some cases among MSM in Argentina (Fernandez, Kelly, Stevenson, Sitzler, Hurtado, Valdez, Vallejo, Somlai, 9 Four of the six highest HIV prevalence countries in the region-Belize, Honduras, Panama, and Guatemala-are located in Mesoamerica (USAID 2006) . Amirkanian, Benotsch, Brown, & Opgennorth, 2005) . In Mesoamerica where HIV is transmitted predominantly via sex, IDU plays a lesser role, but HIV prevalence among female sexworkers ranges from about 1% in Nicaragua, 2% in Panama, 4% in El Salvador and 5% in Guatemala, to over 10% in Honduras (UNAIDS, 2006) . Because developmental deficiencies in Mesoamerica frequently compel large numbers of people to migrate, which further fuels the epidemic, HIV is found mainly among marginalized populations. Recent surveillance data indicate that although sex between men is hidden, it is a powerful factor in the newly-emerging epidemics of Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Panama (UNAIDS, 2006) .",

Why are transport workers and their sexual partners particularly susceptible to these diseases, as compared to other professional groups? Part of the explanation lies in the fact that the broad risk environment includes transport corridors, nodes, and hubs as well as bars, brothels, and other related operations. Further, transport in Mesoamerica connects areas of high-and low-HIV prevalence, while busy transport routes, nodal points, and border crossings are associated with factors of transmission and higher than average prevalence (Bronfman et al., 2002; Bronfman, Negroni, & Kendall, 2002) . Finally, transport workers experience elevated insecurity, have limited access to health services, and are vulnerable to harassement and extortion (often with police complicity) (Bronfman et al., 2002) . Transport workers are not the only ones at risk; individuals who provide various services along transport corridors are also highly vulnerable to disease.",

Argentinian truckers are known to engage in unsafe sexual practices with sexworkers, teenagers, and sometimes children, as young girls in the poorest northern regions often exchange unprotected sex for material resources (CDC, 2003) . Brazilian truckers, on the other hand, who drive longer distances, are particularly vulnerable to risks due to their long waits at checkpoints to clear customs, which gives them time and opportunity for risky encounters (Population Council, 2006 ) and due to their extensive drug use (Silva, Greve, Yonamine, & Leyton, 2003) . According to data collected in several Brazilian towns bordering Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay as well as in the town of Santos, truckers form complex and risky sexual networks with multiple partners on the road (Lacerda, Gravato, McFarland, Rutherford, Iskrant, Stall, & Hearst, 1997; Lippman, Pulerwitz, Reingold, Chinaglia, Ogura, Hubbard, van Dam, & Diaz, 2004) . In addition to truckers, three-wheeled motorcycle taxi-drivers, used heavily in public transport in Peru, play an important role in the spread of bacterial STIs (Paris, Gotuzzo, Goyzueta, Aramburu, Caceres, Crawford, Castellano, Vermund, & Hook, 2001) . Motorcycle operators at a northeastern Amazon city were found to use the services of sexworkers and have other casual sex partners of both genders during their trips. In fact, findings reported high gonorrhea and chlamydia incidences along with low condom use.",

Within this environment, Polish, Belarussian, Russian, Ukrainian, Moldovan, and Lithuanian truckers who cross the borders of these nations engage in regular casual sex on the road with random partners. Revealing data denote that over 60% of these truckers practice unprotected sex, even though they are aware of STI/HIV transmission risks (Kulis et al., 2004) .

Sexual exchanges unfold primarily at truckstops where sex is solicited via CB-radio communication, via pimps and drug runners who provide women and drugs as \"package deals,\" or by knocks on truck doors by women themselves and the actual sex takes place mostly in the cabs of trucks parked in the \"party row\" 17 , at nearby motels, or in nearby wooded areas. Condom use is at best inconsistent, mainly due to truckers' incomplete understanding of potential risks and sexworkers' need for income expressed in the desire to have as many encounters as possible by going from one truck cab to the next. Research findings corroborate that truckers' risk-laden sexual encounters along their routes are often combined with substances that are used to relax or party during downtimes (alcohol, crack, cocaine, marijuana) or to stay awake during long drives (methamphetamines, speed) (Apostolopoulos et al., 2006a; Stratford et al., 2000) . Various drugs are easily available around truckstops and other trucking settings 18 and are frequently exchanged between truckers and sexworkers either as payment for sex or to use together during their encounters. Most female sexworkers interviewed at truckstops were victims of various traumatic experiences (i.e., abuse, violence), homeless, addicted to drugs, and at great risk for STIs/HIV. Many women indicated that they came from socioeconomically depressed and densely populated urban areas, where they engaged in sex with members of other core groups (drug suppliers, pimps), thereby corroborating STI endemicity in these populations at risk (Apostolopoulos et al., 2006a,b) . Life around truckstops further increases sexworkers' risks for physical, emotional, and sexual abuse as well as disease and social stigmatization. Nevertheless, many of these sexworkers remain at 19 Initial contact ranges from truckchasers loitering in toilets at highway rest areas and tapping the brake-lights of their parked cars to various types of suggestive body language to get truckers' attention. 20 Empirical studies have focused on Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Ghana, Brazil, and Kiribati. truckstops because they feel safer than on the street, they assume that truckers have more money and can offer other resources such as rides, and some have repeat customers who are truckers. Sexworkers at truckstops are important members of truckers' risk networks and significantly influence the dissemination of STIs via truckers who bridge high-and low-STI prevalence groups and settings (Apostolopoulos et al., 2006a,b) .",

Within such risk-filled environments, alcohol abuse, contact with sexworkers, poor knowledge of STIs, and unsafe sexual practices comprise key factors that contribute to elevated risks for STIs/HIV and disproportionately high infection rates (Binghay, 2005) .

There are parallels between the chlamydia prevalences among seafarers in Kiribati and truckers (10.2%) in China's Anhui province (WHO, 2001) . The endemicity of chlamydia is of concern because most seafarers have regular female partners in Kiribati with whom they do not use condoms. It is likely that there is a significant rate of chlamydia transmission from seafarers to their partners who are at higher risk for STIs than the general population, as was the case with HIV infection in the same community. Moreover, despite a low .3% HIV seroprevalence, the STI picture suggests that seafarers are also vulnerable to the acquisition and rapid spread of HIV infection-supported by the fact that the high HSV-2 prevalence found reflects high levels of sexual activity by seafarers. In contrast, prevalence of nonviral STIs was lower than expected with no cases of gonorrhoea, and only nine cases of diagnosed syphilis. Low HIV rates can be explained by the low prevalence of bacterial STIs and low drug use (1.4%). Because these surveys did not test for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, or trichomoniasis in the general population, it is unclear if the risk behaviors are occurring in Kiribati at-large. Nevertheless, other studies (Synergy Project, 2002) suggest that itinerant men who have left behind wives and/or steady girlfriends demonstrate low condom use associated with increased STI/HIV transmission to their partners and the general community 21 .",

Similar behavioral patterns were also recorded in the HIV hotspot of Haiphong, among both fishermen and passenger-boat crewmembers (Trang, 2002) . Irrespective of age or marital status, many fishermen in May Chai (docking area of fishing boats) and Binh dock visit sexworkers (with erratic condom-use patterns, despite easy access) even though they are not far from their wives as they live and work in the same town. In addition to frequenting sexworkers, many fishermen also have extramarital affairs along fishing routes, despite social disapproval, and share the view that condoms are not needed with mistresses because such relationships are based on love.",

Because fishing involves heavy physical labor and keeps fishermen away from their homes for over three weeks each month, the men do not see their spouses for extended periods. As a result, during the week-long break when their boats are docked and fishermen get their pay, they engage in entertainment activities that often include commercial sex-readily available wherever the boats dock, and especially at popular karaoke bars in Haiphong and Cat Ba. Conversely, in the central region of Vietnam, there is some level of social pressure on fishermen to remain loyal to their wives, which deters the men from keeping mistresses but not from frequenting sexworkers.

Around the ports and harbors of Ghana, women involved in informal economic activities (i.e., selling food), practice opportunistic transactional sex to supplement their income. Their clients include sailors, truckers, freight forwarders, various port employees, dock workers, and other food sellers and hawkers of various goods. Another HIV risk factor for the dockworkers is that many share occupation-protective items, such as gloves, boots, and helmets, and any accidents involving blood are opportunities for easy transmission (Okello & Ighure, 2004) . Similarly, increased HIV rates of 7% have been recorded among sexworkers at Brazilian ports, whose clients are mainly dockworkers, sailors, and truckers (Hearst, Lacerda, Gravato, Hudes, & Stall, 1999; Lacerda, Stall, Gravato, Tellini, Hudes, & Hearst, 1996; Trevisol & da Silva, 2005) .",

The most notorious delays are experienced at Beitbridge (Zimbabwe-South Africa), Chirundu (Zambia-Zimbabwe), and Komatiapoort/Machipanda (Mozambique-other country) border crossings where truckers can be stuck for as long as several weeks.

Just as its workforce is vulnerable to high risks for STI/HIV infection, it can also play a critical role in influencing the trend of such epidemics by serving as a social vector in disease transmission. This bidirectional relationship that the transport sector has with the STI/HIV epidemic can be instrumental in efforts to combat the epidemic and limit its impact. While prophylaxis, care, and treatment constitute the framework of interventions, the development of robust surveillance systems is fundamental to intervention strategies. Measures need to include comprehensive tracking of: (a) mobility patterns of transport workers; (b) HIV/STI knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of high-risk transport populations; (c) points and types of contact between transport populations and other high-risk core groups; (d) disease spikes and outbreaks within transport groups and the general population; and (e) potential risk-practices of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and their relationhips. It is also imperative to establish an early-warning rapid-response system (EWRRS) for the identification of stressors and to focus on their root causes in order to ultimately reduce disease vulnerability (UNDP, 2004) .",

These efforts have employed synergistic approaches among transport, health, and development agencies with hitherto encouraging outcomes in reducing disease susceptibility for transport populations.
