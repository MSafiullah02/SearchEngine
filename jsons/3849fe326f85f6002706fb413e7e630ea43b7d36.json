Although defence against weaponized pathogens was part of CBRN training in the military, it was the 9/11 massacre followed by the anthrax letters horror that triggered a more active involvement of the Greek public health sector. In that historical moment a third bullet was added to the already existing disease outbreak classi fi cation -naturally, accidental and now deliberate. These incidents and the subsequent 2004 Olympic Games in Athens drove the Greek government to focus on biodefence and revise existing civil emergency planning by inclusion of new emerging threats.",

We witnessed the contribution of faster travel to the spread of disease recently during the 2010 fl u pandemic. Apart from the legal movement of a population, mass illegal immigration also poses a signi fi cant problem in certain parts of the world -e.g. in Greece -in relation to the spread of a disease or reemergence of old diseases like malaria or tuberculosis. The geographical location of Greece and its porous borders due to the signi fi cant coastline make it an attractive destination for those seeking a better living environment or as a way to enter other EU countries as a fi nal destination.",
