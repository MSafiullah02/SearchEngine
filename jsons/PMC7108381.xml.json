The domestic dog has been regarded as a definitive host of N. caninum, but other canids, including coyotes, Australian dingoes and gray wolves, have recently been demonstrated to be definitive natural hosts for the parasite [2]. Many mammals, including cattle, sheep, goat, water buffalo, horse, bison, white-tailed deer, and red fox, can serve as natural intermediate hosts for N. caninum [3]. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that many wild animals are positive for Neospora antibodies or DNA, indicating that these animals may play an important role in the transmission of N. caninum, which makes neosporosis difficult to control [4,5].",

Bacteria and protozoa have also been detected positive in bats, by which these pathogens may be transmitted to other animals or humans. For example, Toxoplasma gondii DNA has been detected by PCR in bats collected from the Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces in China, and they share the same genotype as those found in other wild and domestic animals, and humans [8]. However, there is no evidence of N. caninum infection in bats. Recently, de Jesus examined for N. caninum DNA by PCR in free-living bats in Bahia, Brazil, but the results were negative [9]. The present study aimed to detect N. caninum DNA by PCR in bats from Yunnan Province, Southern China.",

The second nested PCR was performed to amplify the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of the ribosomal DNA in N. caninum using the primers NN1 and NN2 as external primers, and NP1 and NP2 as internal primers [12]. Positive and negative controls were included in each test. The genomic DNA of the N. caninum NC-1 strain was used as positive control, and ultrapure water was used as negative control. The PCR products were electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with an ethidium bromide solution (1 \u03bcg/ml).

Recently, a study conducted in Brazil showed a negative result of N. caninum infection in 97 bats, including 12 fruit bats, 49 insectivorous bats, and 36 vampire bats. These results may be related to the contamination of oocysts in the environment, the susceptibility of bats to N. caninum, and the sensitivity of detection methods. We used nested-PCR methods targeting Nc-5 and ITS1 genes to detect N. caninum DNA in bats, which may be helpful to increase the positive detection rate of the parasite. Unfortunately, the bat tissue had been used for the detection of viruses and parasites and was no longer suitable for histopathological analysis to confirm the molecular detection of N. caninum [21,22].",
