Such specific antibodies are often inaccessible and the only solution is in-house antibody production commonly conducted in laboratory mice and rabbits. Standard antibody production in mammals consists of in vitro expression of the antigen, its purification and administration and finally bleeding of the immunised animals for serum extraction. Depending on the amount of serum needed and on how bleeding is commenced up to the whole amount of the animals' blood must be collected. In such cases final bleeding is commenced and leads to animal sacrification.",

Since 1969 it has been known that IgG-like molecules are found in chicken serum (Leslie and Clem, 1969). Because of their predominance in the egg yolk they have been designated IgY. Until today IgY have been found in all bird species which offers new perspectives for antibody production. The necessity for antibodies specific for several poxviral proteins that are potentially involved in pathogenesis and modulation of apoptosis has led to the development of a straightforward procedure of producing IgY.",

One of the most striking advantages is the fact that B-cell formation and differentiation in the chicken are performed completely differently from those in mammals (Reynaud et al., 1989, Pink et al., 1985). Because IgY antibodies recognise different antigens they can become valuable tools against difficult target epitopes. Moreover, birds can produce antibodies against proteins that are highly conserved in mammals and that may not be immunogenic in rabbits or mice (Tini et al., 2002). Finally, there is no cross-reactivity between mammal and avian antibodies, as well as no interference in immunological assays caused by the human complement system and rheumatoid factors. This is useful for complex immunocytochemistry applications with multiple antibodies (Larsson et al., 1993, Carlander et al., 1999). In cases where antibodies are used for virus diagnostics, IgY help avoiding false positive reactions in samples containing bacteria which could occur when IgG is used. This is founded by the fact that IgY do not bind bacterial surface proteins like protein A or protein G (Warr et al., 1995).",

It is reported that the amount of IgY equal to the antibody content in 0.5 l of mammalian serum (in mice 0.1 ml blood can be taken once a week [Diehl et al., 2001]) can be delivered by a chicken in one month (Jensenius et al., 1981).",

This leads to a reduction of stress for the animals (Schade et al., 1991) along with the reduced frequency of immunisations because high antibody titres are reached after DNA applications (Gassmann et al., 1990). In general, DNA immunisation forms an effective alternative for antibody design and production in mice (Wolff et al., 1990, Wolff et al., 1992). By applying nucleic acids for immunisation, there is no longer a need for expensive expression, complex purification and renaturation of immunogenic epitopes. Furthermore, the exclusion of inactivated biological materials (like virus particles or bacterial cells) for immunisation increases security for animal holding facilities. By application of DNA there is no risk of contamination with inefficiently inactivated microorganisms especially when working with highly pathogenic agents.",

Furthermore, codon optimisation becomes possible for higher expression efficiency (avoiding the usage of low-level tRNA species) (Grosjean and Fiers, 1982), as well as selection of highly immunogenic domains of complex proteins for subunit immunisation. Recently, a DNA vaccine was used to produce antibodies in ducks specific for Hepadnavirus proteins (Abouzid et al., 2005). DNA was applied by injection and different expression vectors (pCI, pTriEX) were used to optimise protein expression. Also, recently IgY antibodies specific for SARS-Coronavirus were produced in chickens (Fu et al., 2006). However, whole inactivated virus particles were used in this approach, potentially reducing specificity to native virus particles, as immunogenicity may be modified following inactivation.",

A reason for this could be the fact that the p28 subunit chosen for immunisation showed a low relative surface probability compared to the F1L subunit according to Fig. 1. Due to its putative function and importance within p28, the C-terminal part (RING domain) of this protein seems more adequate for immunisation. However, this part is lacking in p28 homologues of several VACV strains and should not be used for antibody production when generic detection is required. An expansion of the subunit used for immunisation in 3\u2032-direction would presumably have not increased immunogenicity as hydrophilicity, antigenic index and surface probability downstream amino acid residue 100 are extremely low. The implementation of an earlier third immunisation step before day 60 post immunisation could prevent a titre reduction and lead to a further boost (Wang et al., 2008).",

The OPV codon usage is more effective in mice as rodents represent a possible host for VACV and a natural host for CPXV. Codon optimisation during DNA vaccine design could achieve higher immunogenicity caused by a more effective expression of antigen in the chicken and lead to higher titres, particularly with regard to p28 (Garmory et al., 2003, Liu et al., 2001). A drawback of codon engineering is the necessity of gene synthesis or a complex PCR strategy; however, future projects will evaluate this approach.",
