            "text": "With the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the number of infected patients was rapidly increasing in Daegu, Korea. With a maximum of 741 new patients per day in the city as of February 29, 2020, hospital-bed shortage was a great challenge to the local healthcare system. We developed and applied a remote brief severity scoring system, administered by telephone for assigning priority for hospitalization and arranging for facility isolation (\"therapeutic living centers\") for the patients starting on February 29, 2020. Fifteen centers were operated for the 3,033 admissions to the COVID-19 therapeutic living centers. Only 81 cases (2.67%) were transferred to hospitals after facility isolation. We think that this brief severity scoring system for COVID-19 worked safely to solve the hospital-bed shortage. Telephone scoring of the severity of disease and therapeutic living centers could be very useful in overcoming the shortage of hospital-beds that occurs during outbreaks of infectious diseases.",

Only healthcare facilities were allowed to carry out isolation during epidemics. 6 An empirical guideline was very in need to reduce the mortality rate of the population in the emergent situation in Daegu, Korea. We developed a brief severity scoring system for COVID-19 confirmed patients which can be used for assessing the severity of patients by telephone communication ( This system aimed to give priority to hospitalization for severely ill patients and we began using this system on February 29 2020 ( Fig. 1 ). This scoring system is composed of items indicating age, the severity of the disease, underlying diseases, and social factors and each item has a different weight ( Table 2) .",

Facility isolation centers for patients who were waiting at home were prepared while waiting for approval for the facility isolation option and this was included in the revised government guidelines on March 2, 2020. Health officials of government labeled \"therapeutic living centers\" for the isolation facility. Asymptomatic to mild cases of COVID-19 were considered suitable for the therapeutic living centers. Moderate severity patients were deemed suitable for the community hospital (group A and B, A is more severe than B). Severe pneumonia patients were to be admitted to a tertiary care hospital. It was necessary to determine the appropriate hospitalization option by doctors recording the symptoms of a person over the telephone without seeing the patient with COVID-19.",
