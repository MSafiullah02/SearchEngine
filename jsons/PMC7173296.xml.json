            "text": "\nInfectious bronchitis virus (IBV) represents one of the most relevant infectious diseases of poultry, causing severe economic losses mainly associated to respiratory and reproductive syndromes, decreased productive performances and increased mortality. Even if biosecurity and good management practices are fundamental in the disease containment, widespread vaccination is also essential to control the disease. Like other coronaviruses and ssRNA+ viruses, IBV displays a high mutation and recombination rate [1], [2]. This has caused the crowding of a huge genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity and the emergence of plenty of IBV variants whose cross-protection has been proven poor [3], [4]. In Italy, IBV is still the major threat for poultry farms and displays a high prevalence and variety of circulating genotypes. Although five genotypes are currently detected (i.e. QX (72%), followed by 793B (16%), Mass (8%), Q1 (3%) and D274 (1%)) [5], the QX genotype is by far the most commonly associated to clinical outbreaks and, in all probability, the only relevant field genotype. Despite the development of homologous vaccines was often impractical or impossible, the immunization using multiple vaccines, based on different genotypes, has been proven to be beneficial, broadening the protection spectrum (i.e. \u201cprotectotype concept\u201d) [6]. Consequently, vaccination schedules typically involve a combination of two genotypes, with acertain variability among countries and/or regions. In Italy, broiler vaccination protocols conform to this theory: animals were routinely immunized with a Mass-based spray vaccine at hatchery and a 793B-based one in field via drinking water. Recently, a trend toward administration of the two vaccines at 1 day of life has been observed. However, the costs associated with the vaccination as well as the risk of rolling-reactions, have persuaded many companies to suspend or modify vaccination protocols against IBV. In a recent study, we demonstrated that such change had a noteworthy impact on IBV genotypes circulation in Italy, leading to the substantial disappearance of the 793B genotype, suggesting that its presence was due to the spreading of vaccine strains or vaccine-related ones [5]. However, the effects of this strategy on field strain epidemiology and clinical outbreak frequency has been never evaluated in detail. Despite experimental trials demonstrated that the Mass vaccination is not protective against a QX challenge when administered alone while it is effective in combination with a 793B vaccine strain [7], their generalization to field conditions is often hazardous due to the extreme differences between the two settings. On the other hand, the collection of the huge amount of data necessary for rigorous large-scale field studies is often impossible due to economical and practical constraints. The development of a theoretical framework and mathematical models to reconstruct evolutionary features and population history of rapidly evolving viruses offers a great opportunity to reconcile and investigate viral epidemiology and evolution [8], [9], [10], [11], an approach that has been proven effective for the study of many human [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] and animal [17], [18], [19], [20] diseases.",

Each dataset was analyzed performing at least two independent runs of 200 million generations each. Population parameters and trees were sampled every 20 thousand generations. Results of the two runs were merged using LogCombiner and accepted only if estimated sample size (ESS), after removal of a 10% burn-in, was greater than 200 and the trace plot, displayed using Tracer 1.5, demonstrated a good convergence and mixing.

A transitory decrease was observed between December 2013 and June 2014. Since late spring 2014, a new sharp increase, peaking in February 2015 was observed.

At first, a comparison between countries with similar epidemiological status but pursuing different vaccination plans was performed based on the coalescent-based analysis of the hyper-variable region of S1 gene. In Spain the same approach based on a combination of Mass plus 793B vaccination was applied over time. Accordingly, and differently from Italy, the IBV QX population dynamics remained constant during the whole study period, already suggesting that, despite not being able to eradicate the pathogen, this strategy was effective in controlling it in field conditions.

It seems clear that vaccination with Mass plus 793B genotypes was able to at least partially control QX spread during the first epidemiological phase, confirming the experimental evidences. While the persistence of a viral shedding was reported also under experimental conditions, the report of a certain frequency of clinical outbreaks in vaccinated flocks clashes with the absence of clinical signs reported by Terregino et al., (2008). Nevertheless, it is well known that vaccine administration is often sub-optimal in field conditions and the presence of several co-factors can easily explain the partial protection induced by these vaccination strategies. After vaccination via drinking water with the 793B genotype was suspended in spring 2013, the epidemiological situation remained substantially stable for almost a year. The transitory decrease in relative genetic diversity, which occurred between December 2013 and June 2014 (Fig. 1), mirrors the implementation of a large-scale trial with a newly registered 793B-based vaccine. Therefore, it can be speculated that this new strategy provided a higher protection against the circulating strains. Nevertheless, the companies decided to stop the trial because the reduction in the number of outbreaks was considered unsatisfactory. This decision was followed by a dramatic increase in viral population size, which preceded in about 2\u20133 months a peak in the number of clinical outbreaks (Fig. 2). This evidence is quite expected since the sole Mass vaccine was already reported to be ineffective against QX challenge [36]. The delay between the change in viral population and clinical manifestation is probably ascribable to the need of reaching an adequate infectious pressure plus the disease incubation time, a hypothesis that could also be adduced to explain the apparent limited practical effect of the introduction of the new 793B vaccine. In fact, it is possible to speculate that a relatively low viral burden can be tolerated without evident clinical problems thus limiting the benefits of a further reduction. Nevertheless, the economical impact of sub-clinical infections, demonstrated for several livestock diseases [37], [38], [39], [3], [35], was not accounted in the present study. The inverse relationship between relative genetic diversity as well as vaccination period and the age of outbreaks occurrence (Fig. 3) further supports this hypothesis. The higher and long lasting protection induced by double vaccination protocols can have both increased the individual resistance to infection and decreased the infectious pressure (of which the relative genetic diversity can be considered as a proxy) leading to a delayed disease outbreaks. More challenging is to explain the long latency observed between vaccination withdrawal and epidemiological changes. Other concomitant and unconsidered changes like co-infection, climate changes or other managerial choices, etc. could have also played a role and will deserve further investigation. The scenario herein described and the relative lack of information stress once more the need for a systematic and rigorous evaluation of the long term effects of managerial policies, since extemporaneous and subjective judgments can lead to a dramatic bias in disease epidemiology comprehension.",

Among the factors that could have contributed to this impressive effectiveness, two changes could have played a major role. Firstly, part (less than 20%) of the Italian poultry population started to be vaccinated with QX-based vaccines, which can be reasonably assumed to provide an optimal protection against the homologous strains [40]. Secondly, a strong trend toward the administration of both Mass and 793B vaccine at 1 day of life emerged during the last year in Italy. Traditionally, the induced protection is thought to be higher when vaccines are administered two weeks apart compared with their combination on the same day [3]. Consequently, the benefits of the new strategy could be due to the higher standardization, vaccine coverage and to the decrease of vaccine-reactions compared with field vaccination via drinking water.",

A set of criteria for judging if the available information is enough to support a conclusion of causality were proposed by Sir Austin Bradford Hill [41] and are here briefly summarized: (I) Strength of Association. The stronger the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, the less likely the relationship is due to an extraneous variable. (II) Temporality. A cause has to precede an effect in time. (III) Consistency. Multiple observations under different circumstances and study settings increase the credibility of a finding. (IV) Theoretical Plausibility. It is easier to accept an association as causal when there is a theoretical basis for such a conclusion. (V) Coherence. The association must be coherent with other knowledge. (VI) Specificity in the causes. In the ideal situation, the effect has only one cause. (VII) Dose Response Relationship. There should be a relationship between the risk factor exposure and the disease. (VIII) Experimental Evidence. Related researches based on experiments support a causal inference. (IX) Analogy. A commonly accepted phenomenon in one area can be applied to another area.",

Criteria I and II are clearly accomplished by the Italian scenario where vaccine administration changes were invariably followed by a decrease on IBV population. Similarly, the reversibility of this effect was proven after vaccine withdrawal which led to an increase in viral population size and outbreak frequency in absence of other reasonable causes (point VI). The vaccination trial performed between December 2013 and June 2014, affecting only a limited portion of the poultry flocks, caused a less marked decrease in viral population size compared with the outstanding one experienced after November 2015, when the whole poultry population was massively vaccinated. Consequently, even if it is hard to be confidently proven in the present study, a dose response relationship (point VII) can be at least hypothesized.",
