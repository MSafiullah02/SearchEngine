Currently, no standard method is available to determine its location. Occasionally, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or angiography has been used [1] [2] [3] . Both techniques, however, bear disadvantages including radiation exposure and use of iodinated contrast media. We assessed the feasibility and safety of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to detect the watershed at the bedside in patients on bifemoral VA ECMO at three ICUs of a European tertiary care facility.",

The mechanical index was set to 0.05-0.10 field of view. Prior to CEUS, the arterial bubble sensor activating zero-flow mode was disabled. The acoustic alarm was kept active.

The feasibility of CEUS was assessed based on qualitative image evaluation, the amount of contrast media administered, and the rate of bubble detection. Secondary outcomes were safety and frequency of radial arterial pulsatility. Safety variables included ECMO settings, hemodynamics, and neurologic assessment and were obtained over a 6-h period after CEUS.",

In the remaining five patients, contrast-enhanced continuous blood flow was visible throughout the abdominal and thoracic aorta indicating watershed location close to the aortic root. The pulsatility of the left radial arterial waveform and opening of the aortic valve was present in all patients. Acoustic bubble detection occurred in all patients after CEUS. No changes in the safety variables related to CEUS occurred (Table 1) . CT imaging of the brain (8/10 patients) showed no cerebral lesions suggesting particle embolism. ",
