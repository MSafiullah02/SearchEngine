It is estimated that risk of DM will be greatly increased in the future. Between 1990 and 2010, the incidence of DM nearly tripled with 1.9 million new cases diagnosed in 2010 in USA (Yu et al. 2014). According to the World Health Organization, America, Bangladesh, India, Italy, Brazil, Russia, Pakistan, China, Japan and Indonesia, are the top ten countries with highest number of diabetic patients (Noor et al. 2015). T2DM is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by impaired insulin secretion, variable degrees of insulin resistance, and increased glucose production which is more common and mainly known disease of the elderly age. In adults, there is increased chance of early-onset of DM especially in industrialized countries. In 2011, the incidence of DM in people older than 65 years was 26.9% in USA and 11.3% in people older than 20 years (Apelqvist et al. 2000).",

            "text": "DM is a known risk factor for certain infectious diseases because diabetic individuals are in an immunocompromised due to their uncontrolled diabetes mellitus notably hyperglycemia (Shah and Hux 2003; Muller et al. 2005). Due to which there is a higher risk of number of other medical complications including eye problems and blindness, cardiovascular disease, lower extremity amputations and renal disease in diabetic individuals as compared to that in non-diabetic individuals. Among the various causative factors, hyperglycemia is one of the main culprits to impair the overall immunity of diabetic patient via involvement of various mechanistic pathways. Immunocompromised state is invariable in all diabetic patients. Not all diabetic patients are immune-compromised except those patients having uncontrolled diabetes are considered immunocompromised due to negative effects of hyperglycemic environment that favors immune dysfunction such as damage to neutrophil function, impairment of antioxidant system and humoral immunity as shown in Fig. 1 (Casqueiro et al. 2012a; Calliari et al. 2019). High blood glucose impairs both innate and adaptive immunity through various mechanisms. Chronic hyperglycemia in diabetic patients can result in acidosis, which reduces the activity of immune system. Upon treatment of acidosis and hyperglycemia, the effects can be reversible (Casqueiro et al. 2012b). Immune-compression is a heterogeneous group of diseases affecting various components of the immune system. The immune-compromised states can lead to different disorders that results in impairment of human immune system including human immunodeficiency virus infection, primary immune deficiency, and immunosuppression-related medical treatment, such as high-dose corticosteroid uses or transplantation therapy. Among these, human immunodeficiency virus infections are the most notorious. Clinical complications in immune-compromised patients vary from severe infections to unusual malignancies affecting major organs (Zheng and Zhang 2014).",

In diabetic patients, identified bacteria, i.e., Enterococcus spp. (4%), Staphylococcus spp. (5%), Klebsiella spp. (6%), and E. coli (71%). Enterococcus spp. were more commonly found than Klebsiella spp. and Staphylococcus spp. in patients without DM. Rates of other species such as Proteus spp., Pseudomonas spp. and other bacteria such as Streptococcus B were found close in both groups of individuals (Table 1) (Malmartel and Ghasarossian 2016). As E. coli causes majority of infections in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. However, in these patients, other strains are also cultured frequently. For example, one study reported that 47% of urinary tract infections in diabetic patients and 68% chance of urinary tract infections in non-diabetic patients was due to more common uropathogen named as E. coli (Lye et al. 1992). Uropathogen other than E. coli also found in diabetic individuals, include Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., and Group B Streptococci (Cook et al. 1989; Zhanel et al. 1990b, 1995). Some studies have also noted that patients with DM are at greater chance of getting infection from a resistant uropathogen (Johnson and Stamm 1989; Lye et al. 1992).",

            "text": "Regarding the outcomes of treatment strategies for asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with DM, few clinical trials have been conducted (Forland et al. 1977; Forland and Thomas 1985). The results of these clinical trials indicate that (1) 2 weeks and 6 weeks of treatment have same effectiveness; (2) the rate of recurrence of urinary tract infection was high, even after following antibiotic treatment for longer duration; (3) mostly re-infections were recurrent (4/8 weeks post-therapy) and these reversions were not with same microorganism. Among bacteriuric women with DM, physician should have awareness about high prevalence of underlying structural genitourinary abnormalities (Forland and Thomas 1985). If asymptomatic bacteriuria leads to serious complications as functional deterioration of kidney then there is need for screening of asymptomatic bacteriuria in diabetic female (Nicolle 2000). Since due to unavailability of such evidences (Schmaldienst et al. 2002) but not including all (Zhanel et al. 1990a; Patterson and Andriole 1997) believe that there is no justified treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria. A randomized controlled trial has been conducted in which 108 diabetic women with asymptomatic bacteriuria diagnosed by two urine cultures showing \u2265 105 colony forming units of an organism per milliliter were randomized to receive a 3 or 14-day course of either co-trimoxazole or placebo (Harding et al. 2002). Patients in group of antibiotic treatment who were infected with resistant microorganism was provided with ciprofloxacin but this study was discontinued due to the occurrence of early relapses in first six patients that were prescribed to an antibiotic regimen of 3-day. Screening of all patients were done after every three months for the detection of bacteriuria. Further suppressive antimicrobial therapy was provided to women confirmed as bacteriuric that were assigned to group of antibiotic therapy. When compared with 20% of women who received antibiotics, only 78% of placebo recipients showed bacteriuria following 4 weeks at the end of initial course of therapy. 23 out of 55 women (42%) in antimicrobial-therapy group and 20 out of 50 women (40%) in the placebo group had at least one episode of symptomatic urinary tract infections during mean follow-up of 27 months. In placebo and antimicrobial-therapy group, the time to first symptomatic episode was similar as were the rates of hospitalization for urinary tract infections and any symptomatic urinary tract infections which exhibited that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in diabetic women fails to decrease the risk of complications. For the screening and/or treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, DM itself should not be considered as an indication (Harding et al. 2002). Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends a 3-day course with co-trimoxazole as standard therapy for uncomplicated acute phase of bacterial cystitis. Alternative treatment can be used in which diabetic patient can be prescribed fluoroquinolone or trimethoprim alone. Other fluoroquinolones also show similar rate of effectiveness but these should only be used as alternative treatment in communities with higher resistance to co-trimoxazole (Warren et al. 1999). For the treatment of complicated lower urinary tract infections, the efficacy of 5-day ofloxacin treatment was compared with 10-day regimen that was performed by double-blind study (Hoepelman et al. 2003). 416 women were included in this study with no confirmed information that how many of them have DM. The authors concluded that both treatments have similar effectiveness (Hoepelman et al. 2003). Another randomized double-blind study which recruited 85 (20%) women with DM, concluded that 7-day treatment with ciprofloxacin or with ofloxacin resulted in cure rate of 90% and 87%, respectively (Raz et al. 2000). Cefixime, a third-generation cephalosporin is well absorbed when taken orally and has plasma half-life of 3\u20134 h, elicits better efficiency against urinary tract infections (Chaudhary et al. 2015). But unfortunately, resistance against cefixime is increased in diabetic patients, suggesting amendments in treatment strategies for urinary tract infections in diabetic patients (Malmartel and Ghasarossian 2016).",

General advice comprises sufficient intake of fluid, minimum spermicides use, during voiding make sure that the bladder is completely emptied and restrictive use of catheter. Ingestion of cranberry juice is an interesting possible preventive measure. At first, it was thought that cranberry juice had beneficial role in the acidification of urine. Recently, it has been recognized that cranberry juice inhibit the adherence of bacteria to the uroepithelial cells and considered as one of most important preventive measure (Raz et al. 2004). Oral or vaginal administration of Lactobacilli is another possible preventive strategy to control urinary tract infections in diabetic conditions. They are thought to protect against urinary tract infections by competitive exclusion of uropathogens and are the part of commensal vaginal flora (Boris et al. 1998). The recurrence of urinary tract infections in women with E. coli infection is reduced by a regular drinking of cranberry juice but not of Lactobacillus GG drink (Kontiokari et al. 2001). The recurrence rate of urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women is reduced by the estrogen administration especially if administered vaginally (Hextall 2000). An essential step in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections is adherence of E. coli to uroepithelial cell. Preventive measures would lead to decreased incidence of urinary tract infections. Recently, attention has been diverged towards the vaccine development. This vaccine is based on type 1 fimbriae of E. coli. It has been observed that this vaccine is helpful in decreasing the incidence of urinary tract infections through the inhibition of E. coli attachment to uroepithelial cells in monkeys to whom vaccine were provided (Langermann et al. 1997, 2000). It is also demonstrated that decrease in the adherence of type-1 fimbriated E. coli to diabetic uroepithelial cells by addition of vaccine-induced antiserum to uroepithelial cells was occurred that was isolated from diabetic women (Meiland et al. 2001). Although, this vaccine is safe but it proved to be only 30% effective in young sexually active women, so further clinical studies have been stopped. Bacterial vaginosis, mainly responsible for vaginal discharge in women of reproductive age, also engaged with high recurrence rate. Probiotics are helpful for preventing recurrences of bacterial vaginosis (Parma et al. 2014). Generally, normal vaginal microbiota is dominated by lactobacilli, and strong evidence has suggested negative association between bacterial vaginosis and presence of lactobacilli. Although, some conflicting studies are still present. Yet, most studies have suggested positive outcomes upon supplementation with probiotics (Falagas et al. 2007).",

            "text": "For the treatment of diabetic foot infections, there is a formulated guidelines and key recommendations provided by infectious diseases society of America. According to these guidelines, it is stated that an empirical treatment of antimicrobial agents should be applied on the basis of likely pathologic agents and infection severity (Lipsky et al. 2006). Antimicrobial agent is more active against gram-positive cocci with special attention for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus which are included in the antibiotic treatment. Extended coverage for gram-negative bacilli and enterococcus species included in the previously treated or severe diabetic foot infections. Anti-anaerobic therapy is required for foul smelling and gangrenous wounds. In the selection of treatment program as well as concerned side effects of potential drug, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, route of administration and frequency are all important factors and have their role in the cost of therapy (McKinnon et al. 1997). It has been reported that patients treated with ertapenem have clinical and microbiological outcomes that were equivalent to those treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (Singh et al. 2005). This study recommends that dose of ertapenem that is given once a daily is beneficial in setting of diabetic foot infections, although the fact about the ertapenem is unable to provide protection from most of P. aeruginosa or enterococci. It also indicates that in polymicrobial diabetic foot infections, these organisms may only be contaminants. Based upon clinical studies, the duration of antibiotic therapy that is considered an optimal duration has yet to be properly defined. In general, treatment of mild and severe diabetic foot infections started from 2\u20134 weeks of antibiotic therapy and route of administration is intravenous and another is started from 4\u20136 weeks of antibiotic therapy. Another way for the control of moderate to severe diabetic foot infection, is the surgical management and it includes drainage, debridement of non-viable soft tissue and bone and aggressive incision. Modern approach is to use adjunctive therapies which include application of negative pressure wound therapy, hyperbaric oxygen treatment and use of antibiotic impregnated beads (Armstrong and Lavery 2005; Krause et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2010). The role of antibiotics remains unclear for the treatment of foot ulcers in patients with DM (Lipsky et al. 2004). However, a high priority for the management of infected diabetic foot as part of multidisciplinary care (Reiber and Raugi 2005) is revascularization (van Baal 2004). The roles of adjunctive therapies are yet to be established (Cavanagh et al. 2005).",

However, the majority of diabetic patients do not care their feet and or regular inspections of their feet (Uccioli et al. 1995; Robson et al. 1998; Boulton et al. 1999). These studies indicate that strategies including regular inspection and examination of feet and footwear, identification of high risk patient, education of patient, family and health care staff, use of appropriate footwear, and treatment of nonulcerative pathology can increase the awareness of the problem and aptitude for self-management and ability to decrease the incidence of minor foot lesions. Several studies have reported that combination of chiropodist care and other strategies reduce the prevalence of non-ulcer pathology (Litzelman et al. 1993, 1997; R\u00f6nnemaa et al. 1997). Proper treatment of callosities, cracked skin, dry skin and nail deformities is essential and specific skills are required (Boulton et al. 1999). A study conducted in Sweden has found that only a few chiropodists had a close cooperation with the health care system, and only 14\u201322% had any kind of education with regard to diabetic foot (Apelqvist et al. 2000). In a cross-sectional population-based study, 80% of diabetic individuals older than 25 years claimed to have access to chiropodist (Gottrup 2004). A number of studies have shown that such footwear, when available and used, can prevent re-ulceration in patients with previous foot ulcers (Edmonds et al. 1986; Chantelau et al. 1990; Breuer 1994; Chantelau and Haage 1994; Mueller 1997).",

Most important causative organism that are responsible for the occurrence of respiratory tract infections -associated with DM are S. pneumoniae and influenza virus (Arancibia et al. 2014). It has been expected that in diabetic patients, the cases of fungal infections that are caused by Mucorales are 50\u201375% while predisposing factor is acidosis. For onychomycosis in diabetic patients, the second responsible microorganism is Aspergillus (Jones 2010). It has been found that during the first four days of hospitalization, the most common bacteria causing hospital-acquired pneumonia are S. pneumoniae, Enterobacter, K. pneumoniae, Serratia, E. coli, S. aureus (methicillin-susceptible), Proteus and Haemophilus influenzae (Zhang et al. 2014; Klekotka et al. 2015). The predominance of bacteria from the 5th day of hospitalization include Acinetobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant MRSA), E. coli, L. pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae (Klekotka et al. 2015). In European countries and America, S. aureus is most commonly isolated bacteria associated with hospital-acquired pneumonia (Jones 2010b).",

Subsequently, such a palliative strategy can prophylactically secure future complication of antimicrobial resistance in diabetic patients.

Thus, radical amendments in hospital diabetic wards such as by providing them isolated and hygienic conditions can ultimately, subsides the consequences of antimicrobial resistance in diabetic patients. Additionally, further well-designed and randomized studies are required for accessing the significance of hygienic conditions and possibly expected favorable outcomes. Surely, such types of studies will also helpful for better understanding of radiological, laboratory as well as clinical characteristics of infections affiliated with diabetic patients.
