            "text": "Hymenoptera venom allergy (HVA) is an underestimated condition representing an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It can occur with varying degrees of severity (from local to anaphylactic reactions) and can sometimes be fatal. According to the data from the European Anaphylaxis Registry, HVA is the first cause of severe reactions in adults and the second in children (48.2% and 20.2% respectively) [1]. In different countries, HVA is responsible for about 20% of the total cases of fatal anaphylaxis [2]. Overall, the incidence of mortality in the various European countries is between 0.03/million/year in Italy and 0.48 in France. However, mortality data are generally underestimated, as deaths are likely to be attributed by mistake to other causes, in particular to cardiac disorders. Moreover, up to 8% of adult patients with HVA may simultaneously suffer from a systemic mastocytosis (SM). SM is a clonal mast cell (MC) disease that can lead to potentially fatal anaphylactic reactions caused by excessive MC mediator release. Anaphylaxis is the most severe clinical manifestation of SM and is characterized by hypotension and syncope in the absence of urticarial and angioedema [3].",

Skin tests are the gold standard for diagnosis and should be carried out at least 2 weeks after the last sting, to exclude a false negative response during the refractory period. The presence of serum specific IgE to Hymenoptera venoms can be detected immediately after sting, even if the best period for their determination is 1\u20134 weeks after the sting. Diagnosis could be complicated by sensitization to multiple venoms (Apis mellifera/vespids or Vespula spp./Polistes dominula) in patients who have not identified the stinging Hymenoptera. The availability on the market of some major allergens expressed in recombinant form allows evaluating the specific IgE to individual molecular markers (CRD, Component-Resolved-Diagnosis). CRD may discriminate between primary sensitization and cross-reactivity in patients with double and multiple positivity of diagnostic tests with whole extracts [5].",
