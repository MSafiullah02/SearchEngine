            "text": "Diabetes mellitus seems to increase the incidence and severity of many common infections, especially those caused by bacteria and fungi, and for some infections there is evidence that hyperglycaemia and poor glycaemic control correlate with infection risk and outcome.1, 2 However, these findings are almost exclusively from studies performed in the resource-rich industrialised world, even though the global epidemic of type 2 diabetes is particularly thriving in low-income and middle-income countries. In this Review, we use \u201cdiabetes\u201d when referring to type 2 diabetes. More than 80% of patients with diabetes live in low-income and middle-income countries, and 88% of deaths related to diabetes occur in these countries.3 According to the World Bank, more than 80 countries are classified as low income and lower-middle income, but in this Review we will use the term \u201ctropical countries\u201d to refer to a bigger number of countries (149 countries according to WHO) with tropical and subtropical conditions, many of which would be classified as upper-middle income (eg, Botswana, China, Colombia, Malaysia, Peru, and Thailand) or even high income (eg, Argentina and Venezuela). The number of patients with diabetes is projected to increase by 55% globally in the next 20 years, but this value disguises how the brunt of the increase will be borne by tropical countries, with predicted increases of 109% in Africa, 96% in the Middle East and north Africa, and 71% in southeast Asia.3 Studies suggest that these estimates could even be too conservative. For instance, in China, there are now an estimated 114 million people with diabetes, with a national prevalence of 11\u00b76% in 2010 compared with 5\u00b75% in 2001 and 1% in 1980.4 The proportion of diabetes that is undiagnosed or poorly controlled is also much higher in tropical countries than in better-resourced industrialised countries.3\n",

Some relatively rare infections\u2014such as rhinocerebral mucormycosis,10 Fournier's gangrene, and Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess11\u2014occur almost exclusively in patients with diabetes. Mucocutaneous and invasive fungal infections, mostly caused by Candida species, are also more common in individuals with diabetes; as are common infections including bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections, skin infections, soft-tissue infections, and eye infections.12, 13, 14 Infections are not only more common in people with diabetes but can also be more severe than in those without diabetes. For instance, observational studies have shown diabetes to be associated with both increased rate of hospital admission and increased time spent in hospital because of infections; increased rates of admission to intensive care units; increased mortality for pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and influenza;13, 14, 15, 16 increased rates of amputation and death for necrotising limb infections;17 and greatly increased rates of endogenous endophthalmitis among patients with fungaemia or bacteraemia.18 Diabetes might also affect antibiotic treatment; it has been associated with increased antimicrobial drug resistance\u2014eg, among Enterobacteriaceae19, 20, 21\u2014whereas impaired kidney function and liver steatosis associated with diabetes increase the risk of antimicrobial drug toxicity. Finally, preventive vaccination could be less effective in people with diabetes, as has been shown for influenza vaccination.16, 22\n",

Firstly, diabetes is associated with decreased host immunity to infections.23, 24, 25, 26 Diabetic neuropathy, macroangiopathy, and microangiopathy contribute to increased rates of skin lesions and poor wound healing, and patients with diabetes have been shown to have decreased functioning of immune cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, T cells, and antibody-producing B cells.24, 26 Other factors that could impair immune responses in diabetes include obesity, vitamin D deficiency, oxidative stress,25 and possibly diabetes drugs.27, 28 People living with diabetes have an increased rate of Staphylococcus aureus carriage, and glycosuria predisposes individuals to outgrowth of uropathogens. Finally, patients with diabetes have an increased rate of health-care-associated infections because of more frequent attendance at health-care facilities, hospitalisation, and instrumentation during medical procedures.29 As reviewed in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, epidemiological studies have linked more profound hyperglycaemia with increased infection rates and mortality, increased risk of hospitalisation from pneumonia, some bloodstream infections, and urinary tract infections.30\n",

For instance, data from a study in Ethiopia showed that diabetic foot ulcers accounted for 39% of admissions of patients with diabetes.37 Reports from Africa and Asia suggest that neuropathy rather than peripheral vascular disease underlies diabetic foot problems, although this situation might be changing because of an increase in cardiovascular disease and its risk factors.38, 39 Inadequate footwear and walking barefoot can contribute to neuropathic foot ulcers in tropical countries. Infection is usually a consequence rather than a cause of foot ulcers, but concomitant infections cause delays in wound healing, and in the absence of proper management, infected diabetic ulcers could progress to systemic infection, gangrene, limb loss, and death.40 As a result, diabetic foot infections are cited as a major cause of prolonged hospital stays, cause of amputation, and mortality in resource-constrained settings.38 As one Indian doctor wrote, \u201cthe severely infected foot is the hallmark of the diabetic foot commonly seen in India\u201d,39 and this observation is probably true for many tropical countries.",

It is caused by zygomycetes and is characterised by rapidly progressive tissue necrosis.

In developed countries incidence of mucormycosis is increasing. The infection is usually seen in immunocompromised patients, especially because widely used azole antifungal drugs are inactive against mucormycosis.49 However, in developing countries, especially India, the number of zygomycosis cases seems to be increasing because of increasing numbers of cases in patients with uncontrolled or unrecognised diabetes.50, 51, 52 In a single tertiary care centre in India, the number of cases witnessed in the past 25 years increased approximately six times;53 and a case series showed that 131 (74%) of 178 patients had mucormycosis associated with diabetes53 (compared with 86 [16%] of 531 patients in France49) and a quarter of patients did not know that they had diabetes. Mortality is high, especially in low-resource settings where use of amphotericin B, appropriate surgery with debridement of necrotic tissue, and correction of uncontrolled diabetes might be more difficult. As a result of diabetes, other invasive mould infections, especially those caused by Aspergillus flavus, might also be on the rise in tropical countries.54\n",

Such an association would be relevant, especially in light of the rising global incidence of gestational diabetes.70 However, to our knowledge, this association has not been studied to date.",

In a single study, diabetes and hyperglycaemia were more common in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy than in patients with Chagas but without cardiomyopathy and healthy people.71 This study supports the hypothesis that the reduced parasympathetic activity caused by T cruzi leads to relative sympathetic hyperactivity, and is consistent with a small study by the same group implicating T cruzi infection in subtle intrapancreatic denervation changes.114 Whether these data really implicate T cruzi in the development of impaired glucose tolerance or whether hyperglycaemia predisposes patients to more symptomatic infection remains unclear. In a mouse model of diabetes, hyperglycaemia was associated with markedly reduced control of experimental T cruzi parasitaemia and increased mortality.115 For African trypanosomiasis\u2014a parasitic disease spread by tsetse flies\u2014no link with diabetes has been published, although murine infection with Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (which causes East African trypanosomiasis) appeared to offer some protection against inducible diabetes.116\n",

Overall, however, data seem to suggest that some helminth infections might protect against diabetes.

Trachoma results from chronic inflammation mediated by C trachomatis. Although there appear to be no biological associations, the key interaction with diabetes is the relative demand for eye health services.150 In 2010, 1\u00b74% of global blindness (total 32\u00b74 million people) was attributable to trachoma, and 2\u00b74% to diabetic retinopathy. Cataract, which is frequently a complication of diabetes, was the cause of a third of all blindness. Onchocerciasis results from ocular inflammation caused by the microfilariae of the nematode Onchocerca volvulus. No interaction with diabetes has been reported, but as with trachoma, onchocerciasis represents a competing demand on eye health services in endemic regions. A more optimistic view would be that it represents an opportunity for added value from service provision. The global map of trachoma is currently being populated by data; it is hoped that efforts at control through the SAFE strategy will start to shrink areas of hyperendemicity. Onchocerciasis prevalence is falling as intermittent mass drug therapy with ivermectin is rolled out in sub-Saharan Africa, and the last remaining areas in Latin America are close to achieving elimination.",

As such, there is potential for overlap of use of clinical services related to peripheral neuropathy and neuropathic foot ulcers, although the additional vascular compromise seen in the diabetic foot is not a feature of leprosy neuropathic ulcers. Surveillance data for eye, kidney, and neuropathic complications of NTDs and diabetes in tropical countries are scarce. As a result, it is impossible to estimate the number of diagnosed and undiagnosed patients who would benefit from integrated services. What seems obvious, though, is that the projected global growth of diabetes will greatly increase the need and costs of preventive and therapeutic services. Brazil for instance, witnessed a 20% growth in diabetes between 2006 and 2010, with an estimated annual direct cost of diabetes of almost US$4 billion.153 Diabetes-associated infections are likely to be a major factor in these costs.",

            "text": "Several conclusions can be made with respect to the relation between diabetes and infectious diseases in tropical countries. First, the global diabetes epidemic disproportionally affects tropical countries, where chronic care, glycaemic control, and wound and foot care can be very challenging. Diabetes increases incidence and severity, and affects treatment and outcome of a large number of infectious diseases, including many\u2014such as tuberculosis and dengue\u2014that have the highest burden in tropical countries. This incidence puts a heavy burden on health services that are often already overstretched. Second, health-care-associated infections and antimicrobial drug resistance are a major problem for patients with diabetes in tropical countries. Third, while some helminth infections might afford protection against diabetes, diabetes might increase the risk or severity of other helminth infections, although data are scarce. Fourth, there is a general scarcity of epidemiological, clinical, and health systems research addressing the interaction of diabetes and infectious diseases in tropical countries except for tuberculosis25, 154 and melioidosis,28, 102, 103 and there are very few data on underlying mechanisms or the effect of diabetes medication. As such, there is an urgent need for more research to address all these issues, and for efforts to better link or integrate care for communicable and non-communicable diseases. And of course, in light of the dramatic rise in diabetes prevalence in tropical countries, the interaction between diabetes and infectious diseases is yet another reason to improve prevention and management of diabetes in high-burden tropical countries.",
