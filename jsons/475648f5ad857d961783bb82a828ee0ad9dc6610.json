Despite advances in antimicrobial therapies, microbiological diagnostic tests and prevention measures, pneumonia remains the main cause of death from infectious disease in the world. An important reason for the increased global mortality is the impact of pneumonia on chronic diseases, along with the increasing age of the population and the virulence factors of the causative microorganism. The increasing number of multidrug-resistant bacteria, difficult-to-treat microorganisms, and the emergence of new pathogens are a major problem for clinicians when deciding antimicrobial therapy. A key factor for managing and effectively guiding appropriate antimicrobial therapy is an understanding of the role of the different causative microorganisms in the etiology of pneumonia, since it has been shown that the adequacy of initial antimicrobial therapy is a key factor for prognosis in pneumonia. Furthermore, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapies are sometimes given until microbiological results are available and de-escalation cannot be performed quickly. This review provides an overview of microbial etiology, resistance patterns, epidemiology and microbial diagnosis of pneumonia.",

The second most frequent group of pathogens was intracellular microorganisms, followed by polymicrobial cases (Figure 1 ). Although microbiological diagnosis of CAP is fundamental to ensure appropriate antibiotic therapy, which is associated with decreasing mortality [10] , microbial diagnosis of pneumonia is achieved in less than 50% of cases and antimicrobial therapy should be empirically administered in order to avoid the delay in establishing appropriate therapy, associated with significant mortality [11, 12] .",

In a recent European study carry out by Aliberti et al. it was reported that MDR microorganisms were involved in 3.3% to 7.6% CAP cases in which the most commonly identified MDR pathogen was methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) [33] . Community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) has become an important CAP pathogen in endemic areas. The presence of the gene for the production of the toxin Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) is the main characteristic of CA-MRSA. PVL toxin causes leukocyte destruction and necrosis of the tissues. Presence of cavitation in the lung of a patient with pneumonia is a frequent characteristic in CA-MRSA, and is usually associated with skin lesions [34] . Since the recommendation of current international guidelines for severe CAP is empiric therapy with \u03b2-lactam with macrolide or fluoroquinolone, which may not provide adequate protection against MRSA, microbiological diagnosis of these cases is very important [35] .",

Currently, between 20% and 30% of pneumococcus disease cases worldwide are MDR (resistant to more than three classes of antibiotics) [48, 49] . Nevertheless, it is important to note that therapeutic failure involving \u03b2-lactams has not been reported among patients with pneumococcal pneumonia who are infected with pneumococci that are not susceptible to \u03b2-lactams. A reasonable explanation for this is that the mechanisms of resistance to penicillin are due to alterations in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), leading to decreased binding affinity. Pharmacodynamic studies show that a time above minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of about 40% of the dosing interval (T > 40% MIC) is predictive of bacteriological efficacy for \u03b2-lactams. Among the oral agents, aminopenicillins and cephalosporins are able to attain these levels in the lung for fully susceptible strains, and even for pneumococci with penicillin MICs of 2-4 g/mL.",

Among NP cases, HAP occurred in 20.6%, VAP in 42.7% and very early-onset VAP (VE-VAP) in 12.7% of cases. Microbial diagnosis was possible in 69.5% of the suspected cases. The most frequent microorganisms reported were: Enterobacteriaceae, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, and a diagnosis of polymicrobial etiology was reported in 32% of cases. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (27.6% vs. 11.4%), S. pneumoniae (9.0% vs. 2.4%), H. influenzae/ M. catahrralis (13.8% vs. 3.8%) were more frequent pathogens in early-onset pneumonia. The authors also reported a lower incidence of A. baumannii (11.0% vs. 26.5%) and a trend for a lower proportion of P. aeruginosa (17.9% vs. 26.1%, p = 0.09) in this group of cases. Other important data in this study showed that the dominant isolates differed between countries. They reported that in Spain, France, Belgium and Ireland, S. aureus was the dominant microorganism, whereas for Italy and Portugal it was P. aeruginosa, for Greece and Turkey it was Acinetobacter sp., and for Germany the dominant pathogen was Escherichia coli.",
