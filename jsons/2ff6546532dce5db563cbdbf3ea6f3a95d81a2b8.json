One diagnostic challenge is that respiratory infections, which can be caused by several viral pathogens including RSV, usually present with similar signs and symptoms that are nearly indistinguishable by clinical diagnosis. We have described in the chapter a rapid, high-throughput laboratory technique that can detect a panel of common viral pathogens in one single reaction. With the combination of target-enriched multiplexing PCR amplification and Luminex suspension array identification, 12 common respiratory viruses, including RSV A and B, influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, and 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and SARS coronavirus, are detected and differentiated simultaneously within five hours.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is known to be the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and young children (1, 2).

During their first RSV infection, 25-40% of infected infants and young children have signs or symptoms of bronchiolitis or pneumonia, and 0.5-2% require hospitalization.

RSV causes hazardous nosocomial infection and produces outbreaks each year with widespread infections in both children and adults, including medical personnel, who may have a mild enough illness that does not cause absences from work. Furthermore, the spread of the virus is facilitated by the number of young infants admitted during an outbreak who tend to shed high titers of virus for prolonged periods (8) . Other viruses that can mimic RSV infection include adenoviruses, influenza virus (INF) A and B, parainfluenza viruses (PIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and rhinoviruses.

There are currently a variety of laboratory tests available to detect and differentiate respiratory viruses, which have been developed over the last two decades. The use of rapid tests in the diagnosis of RSV infection allows implementation of appropriate infection control measures, thus reducing nosocomial spread (9) and may be useful for consideration of timely treatment with aerosolized ribavirin in severe cases. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests have good sensitivity for RSV, but are not as good for other respiratory viruses (10, 11) . Rapid EIA antigen tests are available for RSV and Influenza A and B; they are easy to perform, and more rapid than DFA, but have slightly lower sensitivity and specificity (12, 13) . Among the respiratory viruses mentioned previously, the vast majority will be grown in traditional viral culture cell lines used in clinical virology laboratories with the exception of hMPV, which is not yet widely used in routine diagnostic laboratories (14) . Furthermore, cell culture has a slow turnaround time with most viruses showing no detectable cytopathic effects until 3 to 14 days later. However, a shell vial technique incorporated with mixed fresh cells (R-Mix, Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc., Athens, OH) can be performed which speeds up the turnaround time to 2 days and has a sensitivity similar to conventional cell culture (15) .
