The nearly normal compliance indicates that the amount of gas in the lung is nearly normal [4].Low ventilation-to-perfusion (VA/Q) ratio. Since the gas volume is nearly normal, hypoxemia may be best explained by the loss of regulation of perfusion and by loss of hypoxic vasoconstriction. Accordingly, at this stage, the pulmonary artery pressure should be near normal.Low lung weight. Only ground-glass densities are present on CT scan, primarily located subpleurally and along the lung fissures. Consequently, lung weight is only moderately increased.Low lung recruitability. The amount of non-aerated tissue is very low; consequently, the recruitability is low [5].",

Vasoplegia accounts for severe hypoxemia. The normal response to hypoxemia is to increase minute ventilation, primarily by increasing the tidal volume [7] (up to 15\u201320 ml/kg), which is associated with a more negative intrathoracic inspiratory pressure. Undetermined factors other than hypoxemia markedly stimulate, in these patients, the respiratory drive. The near normal compliance, however, explains why some of the patients present without dyspnea as the patient inhales the volume he expects. This increase in minute ventilation leads to a decrease in PaCO2.",

The possible key feature which determines the evolution of the disease, other than the severity of the disease itself, is the depth of the negative intrathoracic pressure associated with the increased tidal volume in spontaneous breathing. Indeed, the combination of a negative inspiratory intrathoracic pressure and increased lung permeability due to inflammation results in interstitial lung edema. This phenomenon, initially described by Barach in [8] and Mascheroni in [9] both in an experimental setting, has been recently recognized as the leading cause of patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) [10]. Over time, the increased edema increases lung weight, superimposed pressure and dependent atelectasis. When lung edema reaches a certain magnitude, the gas volume in the lung decreases, and the tidal volumes generated for a given inspiratory pressure decrease [11]. At this stage, dyspnea develops, which in turn leads to worsening P-SILI. The transition from Type L to Type H may be due to the evolution of the COVID-19 pneumonia on one hand and the injury attributable to high-stress ventilation on the other.",

The proposed treatment is consistent with what observed in COVID-19, even though the overwhelming number of patients seen in this pandemic may limit its wide applicability.The first step to reverse hypoxemia is through an increase in FiO2 to which the Type L patient responds well, particularly if not yet breathless.In Type L patients with dyspnea, several noninvasive options are available: high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV). At this stage, the measurement (or the estimation) of the inspiratory esophageal pressure swings is crucial [13]. In the absence of the esophageal manometry, surrogate measures of work of breathing, such as the swings of central venous pressure [14] or clinical detection of excessive inspiratory effort, should be assessed. In intubated patients, the P0.1 and Pocclusion should also be determined. High PEEP, in some patients, may decrease the pleural pressure swings and stop the vicious cycle that exacerbates lung injury. However, high PEEP in patients with normal compliance may have detrimental effects on hemodynamics. In any case, noninvasive options are questionable, as they may be associated with high failure rates and delayed intubation, in a disease which typically lasts several weeks.The magnitude of inspiratory pleural pressures swings may determine the transition from the Type L to the Type H phenotype. As esophageal pressure swings increase from 5 to 10 cmH2O\u2014which are generally well tolerated\u2014to above 15 cmH2O, the risk of lung injury increases and therefore intubation should be performed as soon as possible.Once intubated and deeply sedated, the Type L patients, if hypercapnic, can be ventilated with volumes greater than 6 ml/kg (up to 8\u20139 ml/kg), as the high compliance results in tolerable strain without the risk of VILI. Prone positioning should be used only as a rescue maneuver, as the lung conditions are \u201ctoo good\u201d for the prone position effectiveness, which is based on improved stress and strain redistribution. The PEEP should be reduced to 8\u201310 cmH2O, given that the recruitability is low and the risk of hemodynamic failure increases at higher levels. An early intubation may avert the transition to Type H phenotype.Type H patients should be treated as severe ARDS, including higher PEEP, if compatible with hemodynamics, prone positioning and extracorporeal support.",
