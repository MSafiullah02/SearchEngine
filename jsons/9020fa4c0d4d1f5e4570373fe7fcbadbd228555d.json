Evidence shows that children are less active and more sedentary, with less consistent sleep patterns, on unstructured or non-school days (ie, when they are not physically at school) than on school days. 1 Community mobility data from Google across the 15 countries represented by our authorship show that-compared with the week ending Feb 23, 2020, before the WHO pandemic announcement-time spent in places associated with physical activity such as parks, beaches, and community gardens was down by 31%, and travel by public transport, which is also associated with physical activity, was down by 59% during the week ending April 5, 2020, after a pandemic was declared. Conversely, time spent in places of residence increased by an average of 17%. Compared with before the COVID-19 crisis, Canadians aged 15-49 years reported a 66% increase in time watching TV and 35% increase in time spent playing video games between March 29 and April 3, 2020. Interviews done with 15 parents of preschool children in Beijing, China, found that, compared with pre-COVID-19, nearly all children were going to bed later and waking up later. Sedentary screen time had increased and physical activity levels were very low, with children not being allowed outdoors (unpublished data). In South Korea, we surveyed 97 parents of young children between March 27 and 31, 2020; 79 (81%) reported that their children's screen time had increased and 46 (94%) of 49 reported that their children's use of play and sports facilities had decreased.",

            "text": "If this pandemic has reduced healthy movement behaviours among children, we should be concerned for several reasons. First, data from the pre-COVID-19 period show that, on average, only a fifth of preschoolers and less than 10% of school-aged children meet all the movement guidelines. 2 Given the strong associations of health outcomes with movement behaviours, 3,4 children's health will be even more compromised during COVID-19. Second, this period of home confinement-especially if indoors and in small spaces-could lead to higher risk of vitamin D deficiency 5 , mental health issues, 6 and myopia. 7 Third, although children seem less susceptible to COVID-19, maintaining or increasing levels of physical activity can reduce their risk of respiratory infections. 8 Fourth, benefits that help children to cope with lifechanging circumstances, such as the role of physical activity in resilience building, might be compromised. Fifth, the interactive effects of each movement behaviour might be more pronounced-eg, children who are less active and engaged in more screen time are likely to have poorer sleep. Finally, there could be potential longerterm health and economic consequences if the adverse behavioural adaptations, such as less activity, become the new normal. 9 It is important to examine whether children from lowincome and middle-income countries and vulnerable families in high-income countries are especially at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a greater proportion of these populations live in apartments or shelters that are exposed to overcrowding (appendix), making physical distancing virtually impossible. These groups tend to accumulate physical activity through outdoor play and active commuting to school, which is threatened",

To help children to get enough sleep, keep bed and wake times consistent, keep screens out of the room where children sleep, and avoid screen use before bedtime.\u2022 Educators and teachers should know and promote the movement behaviour guidelines, and embrace opportunities to incorporate healthy movement messages, practices, and policies into daily home-school routines and lessons-eg, when scheduling online lessons, limit prolonged sitting and encourage changes in posture such as regularly standing, stretching, or moving on the spot.\u2022 Health professionals should understand and recommend the current guidelines to parents, family members, and caregivers and reinforce their positive association with children's health during all visits, including remote contacts and telemedicine.\u2022 Governments should promote healthy movement behaviours in children as part of response strategies and public messaging, and should engage influential people in promotion of such messages.\u2022 The media should provide regular messages to promote physical activity and break up extended periods of sitting.\u2022 Children should speak up and advocate for their right to a healthy, active life, while carefully observing pandemic restrictions.
