Routine screening for common infections are an established part of the pretransplant evaluation of donors and recipients. Likewise, strategies exist for prophylaxis and surveillance for common donorassociated infections including hepatitis B, CMV and EBV. However, despite advances in diagnostic testing to evaluate the infectious risk of donors, unanticipated transmission of pathogens occurs, particularly when donors are asymptomatic or have subtle or unusual manifestations of a transmissible Infection. Infectious diseases (ID) providers play an integral role in donor and recipient risk assessment and can advise transplant centers on organ utilization and guide evaluation and management of the SOT recipient. Consideration of the donor cause of death and preceding clinical syndromes are important for characterizing the potential risk for recipient infection. This allows a more accurate analysis of the risk: benefit of accepting a life-saving organ and risk of infection. ID providers and transplant teams should work closely with organ procurement organizations (OPOs) to solicit additional donor information when a donor-derived infection is suspected so that reporting can be facilitated to ensure communication with the care-teams of other organ recipients from the same donors. National advisory committees work closely with federal agencies to provide oversight, guide policy development, and assess outcomes to assist with the prevention and management of donor-transmitted disease through organ transplantation.

However, unexpected transmission of infection (including Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, histoplasmosis, West Nile virus, rabies, Strongyloides sp infection, and others) from donors to recipients has been reported [1, 2] .

For example, screening for Strongyloides spp is recommended for transplant candidates from all areas of endemicity, including but not limited to those who live in the southeastern United States [3] . In addition to identifying and addressing infectious risks among SOT recipients, ID providers offer critical expertise in the peritransplant period to help mitigate the potential risk of donor-derived infections.

In 2006, the Disease Transmission Advisory Group began to review potential donor-transmitted cases, and in 2008 the ad hoc Disease Transmission Advisory Committee (DTAC) was officially established as part of the OPTN patient safety program. The role of the DTAC is to examine unexpected potential donor-derived transmission events, primarily those that involve infection or malignancy. The DTAC reviews cases to determine whether they are donor derived and works with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assess selected cases of public health interest. In addition, the DTAC evaluates aggregate data of all transmission events to enhance patient safety by informing policy change and improving existing screening and notification processes. The DTAC serves as a resource for ongoing education within the transplant community [4, 5] . Although case reviews by the DTAC have been ongoing for more than a decade, with publication of guidance documents to advise providers regarding donor assessment and screening strategies, little is known about potential donor-derived transmission events from pediatric or adult donors to pediatric recipients. A systematic review of unanticipated pediatric-specific potential transmission events reported to the DTAC between 2008 and 2013 was conducted for donors and recipients aged 0 to 17 years [6] . In this study period, investigators identified 5238 deceased pediatric donors who accounted for 17 456 organ transplants that were given to adult and pediatric recipients. From these pediatric donors, 103 (2%) unexpected potential donor-derived transmission events were reported to the DTAC during the study period, and 15 (0.3%) of them were identified as a proven or probable event. Infections accounted for 13 of these 15 events, which resulted in infection transmission to 22 of 54 recipients of organs from these donors. Important to note is that this transmission of disease from donors to recipients resulted in 6 deaths, 5 of which were attributed to infection. The study highlighted key differences in risks between pediatric and adult donors. Pediatric donors were much more likely to transmit viral infection (46%) than were adult donors (19%, as reported from another large DTAC adult cohort), and infections in general were by far the primary transmission event type from pediatric donors to recipients [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1116, "end": 1119, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1122, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1623, "end": 1626, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2645, "end": 2648, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "OPTN policies have been established for infectious risk assessment of potential donors.

It is important to recognize the limitations of the history often provided by donor family members who might not be aware of all medical information or risk factors, particularly in older children or teenagers. The CDC expanded its criteria in 2013 for the identification and disclosure of information regarding donors with increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HBV, or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to reduce the risks of transmitting these infections through organ transplantation [8] . The OPTN mandates testing for all potential donors ( Table 1 ). The HCV nucleic acid test (NAT) is mandated for all donors to detect acute infection in the setting of negative serology results. Donors who are considered US Public Health Service (PHS) Increased Risk Donors (IRD) also must undergo the HIV NAT; the HIV NAT is performed routinely in some donor service areas in which a greater prevalence of HIV exists, including areas such as New York and Los Angeles ( Table 2 ).

Guidance given by ID providers can be informal or more structured, depending on individual institutional and regional policies, and decisions regarding specific donors and circumstances often must be made on a case-by-case basis. One example of a structured systems-based process for identifying cases that warrant ID provider review is the Infectious Diseases Working Group (IDWG), established by the Medical Advisory Board of the New York Organ Donor Network (LiveOnNY) [9] . The IDWG includes transplant ID physicians who provide telephone consultation for potential donors when an infectious concern has been identified. The initial experiences of this group led to the development of a list of red-flag conditions, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, that alert the LiveOnNY coordinators to request an IDWG consultation. The IDWG consultant provides advice regarding infectious transmission risk, need for additional testing, and recommendations for prophylaxis in recipients. The IDWG also provides recommendations regarding emerging infections, such as the need to screen for West Nile or Zika virus.

Furthermore, several studies have documented the safety of transplanting organs from donors with treated bacteremia, including bacterial meningitis [10] [11] [12] [13] . Acute influenza-associated encephalitis syndrome is the leading diagnosis given the results of the respiratory virus panel and the 8-year-old sibling at home with possible influenza infection. Influenza-associated encephalitis is uncommon but well described, and it is associated with a poor outcome. For example, in the Australian Childhood Encephalitis Study 2013-2015 database, 13 patients with influenza-associated encephalitis were identified, and death or significant morbidity occurred in 7 of them [14] .

Influenza and other respiratory virus infections, including those from coronavirus, have the potential to cause significant morbidity in SOT recipients, particularly in lung and, to a lesser extent, intestine recipients. Current guidelines recommend that potential lung and intestine donors who have been diagnosed with influenza within the previous 2 weeks be disqualified from donations. However, this recommendation might be tailored if the donor has received 5 days of antiviral therapy. Other organs (heart, liver, kidneys) can be accepted in the absence of completing an antiviral treatment course if additional consent is obtained and the donor and recipient undergo anti-influenza treatment and prophylaxis, respectively. Oseltamivir-resistant influenza should generally preclude donation, although susceptibility testing is not typically performed or readily available [16] [17] [18] . Current guidelines also suggest that allografts from patients with suspected viral encephalitis not be accepted because of the risk of transmission of West Nile virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and HSV [19] [20] [21] . However, this recommendation must be made after considering the risk and potential benefit. In the absence of viremia, HSV is not likely to be transmitted via heart transplant, but the virus can be present in liver and kidneys.

If a patient does not provide consent, an IRD organ will not be offered to him or her. The growing opioid epidemic continues to increase the number of previously healthy young people becoming donors with the risk factors noted above. Therefore, it is important to understand the testing procedures and the window or eclipse period to help assess the true risk of transmission. The chance of an NAT result being falsely negative in this scenario is influenced by the window period for each virus, sensitivity of the screening test, and the risk of the donor having acquired one of these viruses in the recent past. The risk of missing an infection during the window period depends on the assay used. HIV would be missed in 12 of 10 000 intravenous drug donors using serology compared to 5 of 10 000 using NAT, and for HCV, the decrease is more dramatic, from 300 missed HCV cases with serology compared to 32 with NAT [23] [24] [25] . In a more recent article, the CDC performed mathematical modeling for the United States and found the overall risk to be low and to decrease even more the longer the donor testing was from the time of the last potential exposure.
