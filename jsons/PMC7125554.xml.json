While a special main proteinase, 3C-like proteinase, is responsible for the cleavage of polyproteins, its functional importance make it an attractive target for drug development. Fortunately, the crystal structures of SARS-CoV main proteinase has been determined,[1], [2] which adopt a serine-protease fold and is homologous to the main proteinases from human coronavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus.3 The goal of this study is to find potential inhibitors and locate the ligand-binding sites in SARS-CoV main proteinase based on comparison of nonhomologous tertiary structures, hence to provide clues to rational drug design.",

Furthermore, we turn to examine the remaining three pairs of interactions: Arg40 and Tyr54, Pro184 and Phe185, and Tyr126 and Phe140. It can be seen from Figure 1B that these noncanonical bindings will be able to stabilize the protein structure around the active center formed by Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41). On the other hand, after binding, the small helix Arg40 and His41 locate will expect to move up, the loop Phe140 and Cys145 locate and the loop Pro184 and Phe185 locate will expect to move down, hence make the active center more open for substrate binding (Fig. 1B). These results can be used for rational design of mutagenesis experiments and analysis of conservation of interactions at functional sites. In recent years, the noncanonical interactions have been shown to be important for the stability of protein structure[9], [10], [11] and ligand recognition.12\n",

The structure-based sequence alignment of the above six proteases with SARS-CoV main protease is shown in Figure 2. The results demonstrate that a number of similar beta sheets (marked by b) exist. In particular, there are three similar structural patterns showing conservative residues (bold representation). The catalytical important residues are included in the first two highly conservative patterns: His-Cys or His-Ser catalytic dyads.[2], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] In the third pattern, Gly is conservative in 6 proteases except SARS-CoV main proteinase, the significance of mutation from Gly161 to Tyr161 in SARS is unclear. Anyway, the three structural patterns form the common active center of these seven enzymes, as seen in their superpositions (Fig. 3\n).",
