Foam cells are large, individualized cells characterized by round to oval, eccentrically located nuclei and abundant amounts of vacuolated cytoplasm (Allison and Maddux, 2008). These cells may also contain amorphous, basophilic secretory material (Fig. 12-4\n). Foam cells resemble and can be difficult to distinguish from reactive macrophages. FNA cytology of normal mammary tissue usually reveals small amounts of blood with no to low numbers of nucleated cells and moderate to large amounts of basophilic, proteinaceous material, clear lipid droplets, and adipocytes (Allen et al., 1986). Small sheets and clusters of mammary secretory epithelial cells that are uniform in size and shape may be seen occasionally in aspirates of normal mammary tissue. Secretory epithelial cells exhibit round, dark nuclei and moderate amounts of basophilic cytoplasm. Acinar formations may be noted. Ductular epithelial cells are characterized by oval, basal nuclei with scant amounts of cytoplasm. Myoepithelial cells may be seen as darkly staining, oval free nuclei or as spindle-shaped cells (Allison and Maddux, 2008).",

FCD generally occurs in middle-aged to older animals, although the disease has been reported in dogs of 1 year of age. Formation of FCD may have a hormonal component as administration of medroxyprogesterone has been associated with development of FCD in dogs. In dogs, rapid growth during estrus and regression during metestrus has been noted. The rapid growth of cysts during estrus may be associated with rupture of the cysts. Ovariohysterectomy should be considered when mammary cysts grow and regress in association with the estrous cycle, particularly if multiple glands are involved. FCD is considered a benign lesion in dogs; however, the disease has been associated with development of mammary gland carcinoma.",

The nodule(s) exhibit slow, expansile growth and the overlying skin may develop a blue color, hence the term blue dome cyst (Brodey et al., 1983). Mammary cysts may be classified as simple cysts characterized by a single layer of flattened lining epithelium or papillary cysts containing papillary outgrowths of the lining epithelial cells. Aspiration of mammary cysts typically yields a green-brown or blood-tinged fluid containing low numbers of foam cells and pigment-laden macrophages (Allison and Maddux, 2008). Neutrophils may be increased if inflammation is also present. Cholesterol crystals, which appear as large, rectangular crystalline structures often with a notched corner, may be present as a result of breakdown of cellular membranes within the cyst (Fig. 12-5\n). Epithelial cells derived from the cystic lining may be noted, particularly if the cyst has a papillary component. These cells tend to occur in dense sheets and clusters and may display some mild variation in nuclear size and shape. Mammary cysts may coexist with benign and/or malignant mammary tumors (Brodey et al., 1983). Therefore, aspiration or biopsy of solid areas of a mass associated with a cyst or other mammary masses should be performed to rule out the presence of concurrent mammary neoplasia.",

Moderate to large numbers of epithelial cells arranged in sheets and clusters can be aspirated from hyperplastic mammary tissue.

            "text": "In cats, a form of mammary hyperplasia occurs that has been variously identified as fibroepithelial hyperplasia, feline mammary hypertrophy, mammary fibroadenomatous hyperplasia, or feline mammary hypertrophy/fibroadenomatous complex. Feline mammary fibroepithelial hyperplasia (MFH) is a clinically benign, fairly common condition affecting estrous-cycling or pregnant female cats usually less than 2 years of age (Mesher, 1997). MFH has also been reported in older intact and neutered cats of either gender receiving progesterone-containing compounds, such as megestrol acetate (Hayden et al., 1989) or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (Loretti et al., 2005). MFH is considered a form of mammary dysplasia characterized by a rapid, abnormal growth of one or more mammary glands. In contrast to a neoplastic process, paired glands often exhibit a similar degree of enlargement (Lana et al., 2007). MFH is notable for a marked intralobular ductular proliferation identical to the ductular proliferation seen during the progesterone-influenced early stages of pregnancy (Misdorp et al., 1999). This typical histologic appearance, the occurrence in cycling females or cats administered progesterone, and the identification of progesterone receptors in MFH lesions from female and male cats have led to the belief that development of MFH involves endogenous or exogenous progesterone. MFH usually regresses over time without treatment, although secondary infections may require appropriate antibiotic therapy. Ovariohysterectomy, performed via a flank incision if the glands are greatly enlarged, will often result in regression of lesions and will prevent future recurrences (Lana et al., 2007). However, some cats do not respond to withdrawal of progestogens or ovariectomy and can be treated successfully with the progesterone receptor blocker agl\u00e9pristone (G\u00f6rlinger et al., 2002).",

            "text": "The cytologic appearance of MFH (Fig. 12-6\n) has been reported (Mesher, 1997). Aspirated material of a histologically confirmed MFH lesion consisted of a very uniform population of cuboidal epithelial cells arranged in thick clusters. The cuboidal epithelial cells were characterized by dense, round nuclei with small nucleoli and scant amounts of basophilic cytoplasm. A mesenchymal population of spindle-shaped cells with narrow oval nuclei, one to two nucleoli, and tapering cytoplasm was also present. The mesenchymal cells displayed moderate variation in nuclear size (anisokaryosis) and cellular size (anisocytosis). Moderate amounts of pink extracellular matrix were associated with the mesenchymal cells. These cytologic findings correlated with the histologic findings of hyperplastic ductular epithelium (cuboidal epithelial population) and proliferation of edematous stroma (mesenchymal cells with extracellular matrix). The presence of abundant stromal elements helps to differentiate MFH from mammary neoplasia, which generally contains scant stromal material. Cytologic recognition of the characteristic cell types from mammary masses in a cat with appropriate signalment and clinical history can be considered highly suggestive of MFH, thus eliminating the need for mammary gland excision and allowing for appropriate medical and/or surgical management.",

            "text": "Inflammation of the mammary glands is referred to as mastitis and may present as a focal lesion or may involve one or more glands. Mastitis may infrequently occur from hematogenous spread of organisms, nonlactation-associated trauma, fight wounds, or infected neoplasms. Dirofilaria repens infection of the mammary gland in the bitch (Manuali et al., 2005) and mastitis due to Toxoplasma gondii in a cat (Park et al., 2007) have been recently reported. Mastitis is most often associated with postparturient lactation. It can also occur during pseudopregnancy, as well after early weaning of puppies. It is thought to result from entry of infectious organisms through the teat orifice or damaged overlying skin (Gruffydd-Jones, 1980). Neonatal morbidity or mortality may be the first indication of mastitis. Clinical signs associated with mastitis include swollen, painful glands that result in discomfort while nursing. The glands may become abscessed or gangrenous with necrosis of overlying skin. The bitch or queen may also present with clinical signs of systemic illness such as anorexia, fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. A complete blood count may reveal an inflammatory leukogram characterized by either an increase in segmented and nonsegmented (band) neutrophils or a degenerative left shift with a predominance of immature neutrophils, especially if gangrenous mastitis is present (Ververidis et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Following skin tumors, mammary neoplasms are the second most common tumor in dogs and the most commonly seen tumor in bitches (Misdorp, 2002). Mammary gland tumors (MGT) rarely occur in male dogs with a reported annual incidence of 4 in 100,000 while the annual incidence is 207 in 100,000 in female dogs (Saba et al., 2007; Lana et al., 2007). Many of the MGT reported in male dogs have been associated with small tumor sizes, benign or well-differentiated malignant epithelial tumors, nondefinitive evidence of metastatic disease at diagnosis, and intense estrogen-receptor positivity. The median age for development of canine mammary gland tumors is 10 to 11 years of age, with rare occurrence in bitches younger than 4 years old. Breed tendencies for MGT have been reported with a predisposition in several spaniels breeds, the Poodle, Dachshund, and other breeds (Sorenmo, 2003) and with a greater prevalence of malignant tumors in large breeds than in small breeds (Itoh et al., 2005). A heritable, familial tendency for development of mammary neoplasms in Beagles has been suggested (Benjamin et al., 1999). Development of MGT appears to have a hormonal component as evidenced by the sparing effect of ovariohysterectomy in first estrus cycles and by the increased length of survival time in dogs spayed less than 2 years before mammary carcinoma surgery when compared with dogs spayed longer than 2 years before tumor surgery or intact dogs (Sorenmo et al., 2000). Estrogen and progesterone receptors have been identified in normal, hyperplastic/dysplastic mammary tissue and a majority of mammary neoplasms (Lana et al., 2007; Millanta et al., 2005; de las Mulas et al., 2005). Interestingly, hormone receptor expression, which is a characteristic feature of mature mammary epithelial cells, tends to be decreased or absent in poorly differentiated tumors and metastatic lesions. It is well known that progesterone or synthetic progestins administration increases the incidence of MGT in dogs (Misdorp, 1991). Mechanisms involved in the progesterone-induced mammary gland tumors include an upregulation of growth hormone production by mammary epithelial cells (van Garderen and Schalken, 2002) and a rise in blood levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-II (Lana et al., 2007). Growth hormone and IGF may increase proliferation of susceptible or transformed mammary epithelial cells, resulting in neoplasia. Other risk factors to develop MGT are obesity at 1 year of age and low-fat/low-protein diet (Sorenmo, 2003). Other molecule targets have been investigated to elucidate prognosis or the pathways of tumorigenesis such as cyclooxygenase-2 (Millanta et al., 2006a), heat-shock proteins (Romanucci et al., 2006), VEGF (Millanta et al., 2006b), p53, BRCA1, c-erbB-2, antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins (Lana et al., 2007), beta-catenin, E-cadherin and Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) (Restucci et al., 2007) and connexin (Torres et al., 2005), as well as several proliferation markers such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67 (Lana et al., 2007). Immunocytochemical Ki-67 marker seems to be useful to identify malignant canine tumors and patient poor outcome (Zuccari et al., 2004).",

The World Health Organization International Histological Classification of Mammary Tumors of the dog and the cat combines histiogenic and descriptive morphologic classification, incorporating histologic prognostic features that have been associated with increasing malignancy (Misdorp et al., 1999). Most mammary gland tumors are of epithelial origin. Some tumors are composed of both epithelial and myoepithelial tissue, with areas of cartilage and bone, and a few tumors are of purely mesenchymal origin. About 50% of canine MGT have been classified as malignant based on histologic appearance (Brodey et al, 1983). While some classifications of mammary gland tumors, such as carcinosarcomas or sarcomas, have a consistently poor prognosis, histologic evidence of malignancy does not always imply a malignant course (Lana et al., 2007). In fact, only 50% of histologically diagnosed mammary carcinomas result in tumor-associated deaths (Brodey et al., 1983). Morphologic criteria of malignancy, such as cellular pleomorphism, mitotic activity, and individual grades of anaplasia, are not sufficient criteria for diagnosis of carcinomas. Instead, infiltration into skin and soft tissues and invasion of tumor cells into blood or lymphatic vessels have been identified as best histologic evidence of malignancy in mammary tumors (Misdorp, 2002). When stromal invasion is present, 80% of affected dogs will be dead within 2 years while, in the absence of stromal invasion, 80% of affected dogs will be alive after 2 years (Yager et al., 1993). Using stromal invasion as the primary criteria for malignancy, a lifespan study of over a thousand beagles was reported that correlated the various histologic classifications of epithelial mammary tumors with biologic behavior (Benjamin et al., 1999). Specifically, the study showed that ductular carcinomas accounted for 65.8% of all fatalities due to mammary neoplasia, even though these tumors composed only 18.7% of all mammary carcinomas. Of the malignant tumors, squamous cell carcinomas exhibited the lowest metastatic rate (20%), with carcinosarcomas exhibiting the highest rate of metastasis (100%). Ductular carcinomas metastasized more frequently than adenocarcinomas, 45% versus 35%, respectively.",

            "text": "Accurate and diagnostic exfoliative cytology of mammary tumors is associated with difficulties. Mesenchymal tumors or tumors with a fibrous or scirrhous component may not exfoliate well, leading to a poorly cellular sample inadequate for diagnosis. Tissue imprints or smears of tissue scrapings taken from biopsy samples may improve cytologic diagnosis in these cases; however, imprints generally do not yield as good a sample for evaluation as aspirates (Baker and Lumsden, 1999). Also, mammary hyperplasia, dysplasia, benign tumors, and well-differentiated carcinomas tend to form a continuum of morphologic appearance, making cytologic differentiation of these lesions difficult (Benjamin et al., 1999). Lastly, the presence of stromal invasion, one of the most important criteria for determining the malignant potential of a mammary neoplasm, cannot be assessed by the cytologist. All of these factors can result in either false-positive or false-negative diagnosis of malignant mammary tumors using aspiration cytology. A few studies have examined the accuracy of cytology for detecting mammary malignancies as compared to histologic findings. Allen et al (1986) reported cytologic sensitivities for detecting malignancies of 25% and 17% and specificities of 62% and 49% for the two cytopathologists involved in the study. Positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were generally similar between the two pathologists, with PPVs of 90% and 100% and NPVs of 75% and 59% (Allen et al., 1986). The diagnostic accuracy was reported as 79% and 66%. In another study, the sensitivity for cytologic detection of mammary malignancies was found to be 65% with a specificity of 94% (Hellman and Lindgren, 1989). The PPV was reported as 93% with an NPV of 67% and diagnostic accuracy of 79%. In a recent study, cytologic and histologic diagnostic agreement was 67.5%. However, when suspicious and insufficient/inadequate samples were excluded, a 92.9% agreement rate was obtained (Cassali et al., 2007). The same authors reported a sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of malignant tumors of 88.6% and 100%, respectively, and a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 88.6% for the diagnosis of benign lesions. These studies did not correlate cytologic diagnosis with disease-free intervals or survival times, thus the use of cytologic criteria to accurately predict the biologic behavior of MGT is uncertain. Recent studies demonstrated that cells in malignant epithelial mammary tumors had significantly more irregular nuclear shapes that did control epithelial cells or cells in benign tumors based on differences in fractal dimension and on nuclear diameter and roundness. These morphometric parameters could help in the preoperative cytologic evaluation of canine mammary gland tumors (Simeonov, 2006a, Simeonov, 2006b).",

            "text": "Cytologic examination of most mammary tumors reveals a background containing variable amounts of blood, basophilic proteinaceous material, lipid, and foam cells. Aspirates of benign epithelial tumors (adenomas and papillomas) typically reveal moderate to large numbers of epithelial cells arranged in sheets and clusters (Fig. 12-7\n). These cells are uniform in appearance with smooth nuclear chromatin and occasionally prominent, single, small, round nucleoli (Allison and Maddux, 2008). Acinar structures may be seen in samples from adenomas and palisade; papillary and trabecular cell arrangement can be observed in other benign epithelial tumors (Masserdotti, 2006). Benign complex adenomas or papillomas, fibroadenomas, and benign mixed tumors may yield sheets and clusters of uniform-appearing epithelial cells and individualized or clumped spindle-shaped cells of myoepithelial (complex tumors) or mesenchymal (mixed tumors) origin. Myoepithelial cells may also appear as oval free nuclei (Allison and Maddux, 2008). Examination of mixed mammary tumors may reveal the presence of cartilage or bone elements such as osteoblasts, osteoclasts, hematopoietic cells, and/or bright-pink extracellular material representative of osteoid (Fernandes et al., 1998) (Figs. 12-8\nand 12-9\n). Mixed mammary tumors can be difficult to diagnose using exfoliative cytology. For instance, the presence of spindle-shaped cells may not be sufficient for diagnosis of mixed or complex tumors. Allen et al. (1986) have noted that spindle cells were identified in the mammary tumors evaluated in their study, yet the presence of these cells did not correlate significantly with histologic classification of complex or mixed tumors. Aspirates of mixed tumors also may not reveal all of the cells composing the tumor. In a case report, aspiration of a mammary mass in a dog revealed the presence of osteoblasts displaying moderate anisokaryosis and anisocytosis, osteoclasts, hematopoietic cells, and pink extracellular material (Fernandes et al., 1998). No epithelial cells were noted in the sample. Thus, the multiple differentials included benign or malignant mixed mammary tumor, osseous metaplasia, and osteosarcoma. Histopathology confirmed that the neoplasm was a benign mixed mammary tumor.",

Acinar arrangements (Fig. 12-11\n) may be observed (Masserdotti, 2006). The epithelial cells are typically round, with round to oval, eccentrically located nuclei and moderate amounts of basophilic cytoplasm that may contain amorphous basophilic secretory product and/or clear vacuoles (Allison and Maddux, 2008) (Fig. 12-12\n). Some of these vacuoles may appear as punctate vacuoles of variable number or as a diffuse clearing of the cytoplasm that distends the cell and displaces the nucleus peripherally. Criteria of malignancy that may be seen in these cells include increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio; moderate to marked variation in nuclear and cell size; nuclear molding; large, prominent, multiple, and/or abnormally shaped nucleoli; and binucleation and multinucleation. Increased mitotic activity and abnormal mitotic figures may be present (Figs. 12-13\nand 12-14\n).

In general, sarcomas are characterized by spindle-shaped to irregular cells arranged individually and in small clumps.

Regular, but not irregular, administration of exogenous progesterone was associated with a significantly increased risk of benign mammary tumors and mammary carcinomas in cats (Misdorp, 1991). Hormone receptor analysis has shown that normal feline mammary tissue contains estrogen and progesterone receptors in levels similar to those found in the dog (Millanta et al., 2005). However, unlike canine MGT, the majority of feline mammary neoplasms express very low levels of estrogen and progesterone receptors, which may be related to the high rate of malignancy found with mammary neoplasia in the cat. Other molecule targets have been investigated to elucidate prognosis or the pathways of tumorigenesis such as cyclin A, Cox-2 (Millanta et al., 2006b), HER2, VEGF and E-cadherin (Lana et al., 2007).",

Malignant MGT in cats tend to grow rapidly and metastasize to regional lymph nodes, lung, pleura, liver, diaphragm, adrenal glands, and kidneys (Lana et al, 2007). The single most important prognostic indicator for feline MGT is tumor size at time of diagnosis. Median survival times for cats with mammary tumors greater than 3 cm, between 2 and 3 cm, and less than 2 cm is 6 months, 2 years, and greater than 3 years, respectively (MacEwen et al., 1984).

Given the high rate of mammary malignancy in cats, cytologic findings of a benign-appearing population of epithelial cells, particularly in an older cat with no history of progesterone administration, should be treated with some caution.

If a malignancy is present, staging the extent of the disease should include three-view thoracic radiographs or CT scan of the lungs and any other potential metastatic sites as well as cytologic analysis of regional lymph nodes, metastatic lesions, and/or body cavity effusions. It has been proposed that treatment guidelines for malignant canine mammary gland tumors be based on tumor size, histopathologic type, and differentiation (Sorenmo, 2003). Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for both canine and feline mammary neoplasms. In dogs, it is recommended to perform ovariohysterectomy if intact in all malignant canine mammary gland tumors and to institute chemotherapy in an undifferentiated carcinoma in stage I (Sorenmo, 2003). There is limited information regarding efficacy of adjuvant therapy involving chemotherapeutics, radiation, or immune stimulation in canine and feline mammary malignancies. However, the combination of surgery and adjunctive doxorubicin chemotherapy resulted in improved long-term survival in cats with mammary gland adenocarcinoma (Novosad, 2003; Novosad et al., 2006). In addition, the combination of surgery and adjunctive 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy demonstrated significant survival improvement in dogs with mammary gland carcinomas stage III/IV when compared with surgery alone (Karayannopoulo et al., 2001). In contrast, chemotherapy did not lead to an improved outcome in dogs with invasive malignant mammary gland tumors (Simon et al., 2006). The use of antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen, has been documented in a small number of clinical cases, with somewhat conflicting results in regard to tumor response. These drugs can be associated with undesirable estrogen-related side effects (Novosad, 2003).",

The canine ovary has small ingrowths of the ovarian surface that are called subsurface epithelial structures. The cortex of the ovary contains follicles, stromal connective tissue, and blood vessels. The ova develop in follicles that are of four types: primordial, primary, secondary, and tertiary. Each developing follicle has the oocyte, multiple layers of granulosa cells, and more peripheral thecal connective tissue cells (Fig. 12-15\n). Ovulation occurs when the follicle ruptures, releasing the ovum and allowing the space to fill with blood and luteal cells to form the corpus hemorrhagicum and the corpus luteum, respectively. In bitches and queens, cords of epithelial cells called interstitial glands, which are cells of an endocrine type, occur throughout the stroma. A medulla consisting of richly vascularized loose connective tissue, lymphatics, and nerves lies internal to the ovarian cortex. Channels lined by cuboidal epithelium called rete ovarii are present in this region (Foster, 2007).",

It is supported by a mesosalpinx. The mesosalpinx of the dog completely surrounds the ovary and has a large amount of fat; a small hole connects the bursa to the abdominal cavity. The infundibulum surrounds the ovary. The wall of the uterus has three layers: the outer perimetrium (serosa), middle myometrium, and inner endometrium (mucosa). The perimetrium is composed of loose connective tissue and covered by peritoneal mesothelium. The myometrium is divided into a thick, inner circular layer and a thin, outer longitudinal layer (Fig. 12-31\n). A richly vascularized and well-innervated stratum vasculare usually separates the muscle layers. The epithelium of the endometrium is simple cuboidal or columnar in the bitch and queen depending of the estrus cycle. Simple, branched endometrial glands extend into the lamina propria. The cervix is the structure that separates the external genitalia from uterus and is an effective barrier from the external environment. The cervix does not have transverse folds and tends to open dorsally (Foster, 2007). The normal histology of uterus from immature female dogs and sequential microscopic changes that occur during different stages of the estrous cycle are reviewed elsewhere (Rehm et al., 2007).",

The number of degenerating epithelial cells decreases with time until late anestrus, when all endometrial epithelial cells are cuboidal to low columnar and lack signs of degeneration. Endometrial epithelial cells are arranged in monolayered, cohesive clusters and acinar forms are commonly seen. Single cells are less frequently observed. The endometrial epithelial cells are low columnar during proestrus and estrus and columnar during early diestrus and pregnancy. During proestrus, estrus, early diestrus, and pregnancy, the cells have intact nuclei and uniformly staining cytoplasm. The nuclei of normal endometrial epithelial cells are usually round or oval with fine, stippled chromatin. The nuclei of degenerated endometrial cells are often of irregular shape and pyknotic. Neutrophils are the most common leucocytes observed during proestrus, estrus, diestrus, and early pregnancy, and lymphocytes and macrophages are frequently seen during anestrus.

            "text": "Cytologic examination of vaginal discharges or uterus samples may be useful for diagnosis of inflammatory disease of the uterus in dogs and cats. Cystic endometrial hyperplasia-pyometra complex is a disease that is mainly characterized by progesterone-induced hyperplasia of the endometrium with cystic dilatation of the endometrial glands and inflammation of the uterus with purulent content in the uterine lumen (pyometra) leading to several clinical signs (Agudelo, 2005). The common presentation of pyometra involves older, unbred bitches presenting from 4 weeks to 4 months following estrus with mild to severe evidence of systemic illness (Smith, 2006). Clinical signs may include anorexia, depression, polyuria, and/or polydipsia and abdominal distention with or without vaginal discharge (open and closedcervix pyometra, respectively). Typically, the bitch is afebrile and will often have leukocytosis, although leukopenia is also less commonly reported. Prerenal azotemia commonly accompanies the dehydration present. This systemic disease may result in death due to toxemia, renal disease, and peritonitis. There is an increased risk of pyometra in some breeds. Cystic endometrial hyperplasia-pyometra complex is considered to be less common in cats, probably because cats are induced ovulators, which limits uterine exposure to progesterone. The disorder is extensively reviewed elsewhere (Agudelo, 2005). Escherichia coli is the most frequently isolated microorganism in canine and feline pyometras (Hagman and K\u00fchn, 2002). Anecdotally, Tritrichomonas foetus infection and cholesterol granuloma have been reported independently in the uterus of two different cats with pyometra (Dahlgren et al., 2007; Zangh\u00ec et al., 1999). Treatment of choice for pyometra is ovariohysterectomy with supportive therapy including appropriate antibiotic administration. The combination of a prolactin inhibitor, prostaglandin, and an antibiotic treatment in bitches with pyometra appears to have been effective in rapid clinical improvement, terminating the luteal phase and promoting uterine evacuation. This combination may be useful not only in bitches that are required for future breeding, but also in bitches that are a high anesthetic risk (England et al., 2007).",

Middle-aged to older animals are most commonly affected (Klein, 2007). In the dog, uterine leiomyomas are reported most common and leiomyosarcomas are comparatively rare. These tumors are of similar cytologic appearance to those found in other body sites. Uterine carcinomas are rare (McEntee, 2002). In cats, both leiomyoma and endometrial adenocarcinoma are reported with similar frequencies (Miller et al, 2003). A complete ovariohysterectomy is recommended, and attempts should be made to remove all tumors and metastatic foci (Klein, 2007).",

            "text": "Several techniques have been described for obtaining vaginal cells for cytologic examination (Mills et al., 1979). Most commonly, a saline-moistened cotton swab or thin glass rod with a rounded tip is directed craniodorsally into the caudal vagina. The vestibule and clitoral fossa should be avoided since keratinized superficial squamous cells present in these sites may alter cytologic interpretations. Once craniad to the urethral orifice, vaginal cells are obtained by gently passing the swab or glass rod over the epithelial lining (Root Kustritz, 2006). In an alternate method of sample collection, a small glass bulb pipette containing sterile saline is passed into the caudal vagina and cells are obtained by repeatedly flushing and aspirating the saline fluid (Olson et al., 1984a). Once collected, the exfoliated cells are gently transferred onto a clean microscope slide for staining. In addition, endoscopic vaginoscopy is a useful diagnostic procedure for evaluating the nature and the extent of disease in the vestibule and vagina and for obtaining adequate samples for microscopic evaluation. The technique is reviewed in depth elsewhere (Lulich, 2006). Although several types of stains have been used for cytologic evaluation of vaginal cells, Romanowsky-type stains or aqueous-based Romanowsky stains are most commonly used. These stains are easy to use in a clinical setting and provide good morphologic detail for determining the degree of maturation of the epithelial cells. Papanicolaou or trichrome stains have also been used for estrous cycle staging. These stains impart a distinctive orange staining to the keratin precursors abundant in superficial cells. The ratio of orange or eosinophilic cells to noneosinophilic cells, termed the eosinophilic index, can be used to assess the degree of maturation of the epithelial cells and subsequently stage the estrous cycle. However, these stains may yield variable staining results and the need for multiple solutions limits their practical use. However, an ultrafast modified Papanicolaou stain seems to be a useful technique in the study of vaginal cytology as a tool for assessing the estrous cycle in the bitch (Perez et al., 2005). Indications for vaginal culture include any disorder of the genitourinary tract associated with vulvar discharge and anterior vaginal culture in proestrus for diagnosis of uterine infection (Root Kustritz, 2006). The vagina is not sterile and larger numbers of normal flora are routinely cultured from the caudal vagina than the cranial vagina and during estrus than diestrus or anestrus. However, a larger number of organisms are retrieved from bitches with reproductive tract disease than from normal bitches. It is important to provide a quantitative culture result due to the fact that reproductive tract infection is caused by overgrowth of normal flora.",

The vaginal wall is composed of an inner mucosal layer, a middle smooth muscle layer, and an external coat of connective tissue and peritoneum (cranially) (Banks, 1986). The mucosal layer consists of stratified squamous epithelium, which undergoes characteristic morphologic changes in association with the estrous cycle. Although the mucosa is typically nonglandular, intraepithelial glands have been observed during estrus in the dog. The vulva is anatomically similar to the caudal vagina. The vulva is composed of the vestibule containing the urethral orifice, the clitoral fossa, and the labia. The mucosa is lined by stratified squamous epithelium; some keratinized epithelial cells may be found in the vestibule and clitoral fossa (Allison et al., 2008) Vestibular glands within the submucosal layer of the vestibule are responsible for mucus production, which is most notable during estrus and at parturition (Banks, 1986). The normal histology of vagina from immature female dogs and sequential microscopic changes that occur during different stages of the estrous cycle are reviewed elsewhere (Rehm et al., 2007).",

Although vaginal cytology has been shown to be a more accurate indicator of estrus (Fig. 12-34\n) and, subsequently, ovulation than behavioral signs, evidence of vaginal maturation or cornification is not closely associated with ovulation. Maximum cornification of vaginal superficial cells ranges from 6 days before the luteinizing hormone (LH) peak to 3 days after the LH peak (Olson et al., 1984a). Since ovulation usually occurs 1 to 2 days after the LH peak, vaginal cytology is not an accurate predictor of ovulation. Ova are viable for up to 2 days postovulation and sperm may remain viable for up to 4 days within the canine reproductive tract during estrus. Therefore, bitches should be bred every 2 to 3 days during cytologic estrus (greater than 90% superficial cells) for optimal breeding (Freshman, 1991). Use of plasma progesterone concentrations in combination with vaginal cytology more accurately indicates the time of ovulation, allowing for even greater breeding efficiency and more accurate estimation of the time of expected parturition (Wright, 1990).",

Clinical signs seen less frequently include vulvar bleeding or discharge, an enlarging vulvar mass, dysuria, hematuria, tenesmus, excessive vulvar licking, and dystocia (Klein, 2007). Leiomyomas, fibroleiomyomas, fibromas, and fibropapillomas (polyps) are the most common vaginal neoplasm in dogs and cats (Baker and Lumsden, 1999). These benign mesenchymal tumors are characterized by variable numbers of spindle-shaped cells of uniform size and shape arranged individually and in small clumps (Fig. 12-41\n). The nuclei are typically oval and scant to moderate amounts of wispy cytoplasm are present. The most common malignant tumor is leiomyosarcoma and distant metastasis has been reported. Other tumors with malignant potential include transmissible venereal tumors (TVT), adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, urethral transitional cell carcinoma, osteosarcoma, mast cell tumor, and epidermoid carcinoma (Klein, 2007). The cytologic appearance of these tumors is similar to those found in other body sites. Treatment of vaginal tumors usually involves conservative surgical excision combined with ovariohysterectomy, which is usually is curative for benign tumors (Klein, 2007). In cases of malignant tumors, further evaluation to determine extent of local invasion or metastasis should be performed.",

They appear as firm, friable, tan, ulcerated, and nodular or polypoid masses (Fig. 12-42\n). In bitches, TVT may spread directly to the cervix, uterus, and oviducts. Although metastasis is uncommon, TVT can spread to regional lymph nodes, skin, and subcutaneous tissue. Other reported metastatic sites include lips, oral mucous membranes, eye, bone, musculature, abdominal viscera, lungs, and the central nervous system. TVT is suspected to be of histiocytic origin based on positive reactions to lysozyme, alpha-1-antitripsin, vimentin, and a macrophage-specific immunostain and negative reaction to immunostains specific for other cell types. Recently described is TVT with intracellular Leishmania infantum amastigotes that also suggests a histiocytic origin (Lorimier and Fan, 2007).",

Ejaculate material for evaluation of prostatic disease can be obtained from intact dogs via manual stimulation; however, collection of semen may not be possible if the dog is inexperienced or in pain (Dorfman and Barsanti, 1995). A collection funnel may be used to separate the clear prostatic third fraction of the ejaculate from the sperm-rich first and second fractions (Olson et al., 1987). An aliquot for microbiologic analysis should be placed into a sterile culture tube with the remaining fluid retained for cytologic evaluation. If inflammation is suspected, the cytologic aliquot should be placed into a vial containing EDTA (Baker and Lumsden, 1999). Because of the presence of normal bacterial flora in the lower urethra, a quantitative culture should be performed on the ejaculate fluid. In the presence of inflammatory cells, high numbers (>100,000 cfu/mL) of gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria indicate an infectious process (Root Kustritz, 2006). If cytologic and microbiologic results are equivocal in regards to prostatic infection versus urethral contamination, a quantitative lower urethral culture to compare to the semen culture results may be useful (Dorfman and Barsanti, 1995).",

            "text": "Prostatic massage is used primarily to collect prostatic fluid in dogs unable to ejaculate (Dorfman and Barsanti, 1995). The simplest method for prostatic massage involves passing a urinary catheter, guided by rectal palpation, to the caudal pole of the prostate. A syringe is attached to the catheter and fluid is aspirated as the prostate is gently massaged per rectum (Olson et al., 1987). A few milliliters of sterile saline may be flushed into the catheter and aspirated to facilitate collection of fluid for analysis. Urinary tract infection often accompanies infectious prostatitis, which may confound the results of prostatic massage. For these cases, an alternative massage procedure may be used to determine the source of the infection. The urinary bladder is catheterized, emptied of urine, and flushed with 5 mL of sterile physiologic saline. The fluid from this first flush is collected as the preprostatic massage fraction. The catheter is then retracted to the caudal pole of the prostate. Another 5 mL of sterile physiologic saline is injected through the catheter while the prostate is massaged per rectum. The catheter is then advanced back into the bladder and all the fluid in the bladder is collected. This fluid is the postprostatic massage fraction, which should be relatively free of urinary contamination (Root Kustritz, 2006). Bacterial colony counts and presence or absence of inflammatory cells from the pre- and postprostatic massage fractions can be compared to isolate the source of the infection. Ampicillin, which concentrates in urine but reaches lower concentrations in the prostate owing to its inability to cross the prostatic-lipid barrier, may be administered 1 day prior to prostatic massage to aid in isolation of the source of infection. In general, prostatic massage should be reserved for evaluation of prostatitis in dogs without urinary tract infection or in which the urinary tract infection is controlled. It should be noted that cytologic preparations obtained by catheterization typically yield a mixed population of urothelial cells (Thrall et al., 1985; Powe et al., 2004).",

Dogs with suspected prostatic disease presenting with an inflammatory leukogram and fever should not undergo FNA. If purulent fluid is obtained during aspiration of the prostate, aspiration should continue until all pressure is reduced to prevent leakage of the material (Baker and Lumsden, 1999). However, there are numerous reports in the veterinary literature documenting FNA for diagnosis or treatment of prostatic disease with no complications. Ultrasound-guided transabdominal FNA of the prostate is described elsewhere (Root Kustritz, 2006). FNA of the prostate gland has several advantages compared to other collection methods. Identification of squamous epithelial cells from a prostatic aspirate allows diagnosis of squamous metaplasia, whereas the presence of these cells in prostatic massage fluid could be misinterpreted as normal lower urinary tract squamous epithelial cells. Also, the greater cellular detail obtained via FNA increases the confidence of a diagnosis of neoplasia. The primary disadvantage of prostatic FNA is that focal lesions, such as neoplasia, may be missed (Thrall et al., 1985). However, use of ultrasound to guide the aspirate can lessen this possibility.",

The cytoplasm is finely granular and basophilic (Thrall et al., 1985). Other cell types that may be seen, particularly from semen samples or prostatic massages, include spermatozoa, squamous epithelial cells, and transitional epithelial cells (urothelial cells) (Zinkl, 2008). Spermatozoa stain blue-green with Romanowsky and modified Romanowsky stains and may adhere to other cells. Squamous cells are large with abundant amounts of blue to blue-green (keratinized) cytoplasm. The nuclei of these cells may be round to pyknotic or absent. Cell borders are typically angular to folded. Transitional cells (urothelial cells) are larger than prostatic epithelial cells and have lighter-staining cytoplasm with a lower nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. Normal ejaculate fluid may contain low numbers of neutrophils and red blood cells. Use of excessive amounts of ultrasound gel during ultrasound-guided FNA can result in large amounts of purple, variably sized, granular background debris that may obscure cellular detail (Zinkl, 2008). To prevent this artifact, excess gel should be removed before inserting the aspiration needle.",

Except for hyperplasiaassociated cysts, prostatic cysts account for 2% to 5% of prostatic abnormalities (Dorfman and Barsanti, 1995). Another study reported a prevalence of 14% prostatic cysts in adult, large-breed dogs without genitourinary system problems, and bacterial cultures of prostatic cysts were positive in 42% of cases (Black et al., 1998). Small cysts may be palpated per rectum as small, fluctuant areas in an asymmetrically enlarged prostate. Large, discrete cysts may be palpated in the caudal abdomen or in the perineal area. Unless the cyst(s) become secondarily infected, clinical signs are uncommon (Olson et al., 1987). A bloody urethral discharge, dysuria, and tenesmus may be present owing to increased prostatic size. Recommended treatment is surgical resection, with or without concurrent castration (Johnston et al., 2000). Recently, ultrasound-guided, percutaneous drainage of prostatic cysts appears to be a useful alternative treatment (Boland et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common finding in older intact male dogs. BPH is associated with increases in gland size and weight related to increases in interstitial tissue and gland lumens (Lowseth et al., 1990). Symmetrical cystic dilation of the glands results from increases in the interstitium and gland lumens. The pathogenesis of BPH is not completely understood. However, development of BPH is hormonally dependent and requires the presence of functioning testes (Dorfman and Barsanti, 1995). Dihydrotestosterone is accepted as a key hormone in stimulating enlargement of the canine prostate by enhancing growth in both stromal and glandular components (Johnston et al., 2000). Circulating levels of testosterone are often decreased in older male dogs; however, dihydrotestosterone concentrations are often increased in the hyperplastic tissue (Olson et al., 1987). Nuclear androgen receptor expression is increased in hyperplastic tissue of older Beagles, suggesting increased tissue sensitivity to circulating androgens. Additionally, estrogens appear to act synergistically with androgens in potentiating BPH and may also act directly on the prostate, resulting in stromal hypertrophy and squamous epithelial metaplasia. The treatment of choice for canine BPH is castration or finasteride treatment, as finasteride inhibits conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, causing prostatic involution via apoptosis (Sirinarumitr et al., 2001).",

The dog may also experience locomotor problems due to caudal lumbar or abdominal pain. An inflammatory leukogram with or without a left-shift is often present. Clinical signs in dogs with chronic prostatitis may be absent, or there may be recurrent urinary tract infection, poor semen quality with infertility, or sometimes decreased libido (Johnston et al., 2000). Intermittent or constant urethral discharge may also be noted. Prostatic abscesses may present with signs related to enlargement of the prostate (tenesmus, dysuria), constant or intermittent urethral discharge, and evidence of systemic illness related to endotoxemia or peritonitis. Treatment of prostatitis involves appropriate antibiotic therapy as determined by culture and sensitivity. In acute prostatitis, most antibiotics will reach the site of infection since the prostate-lipid barrier is disrupted (Olson et al., 1987). Antibiotics for treatment of chronic prostatitis should be selected for the ability to cross the lipid barrier, which is usually intact, and for the ability to concentrate in the prostate. In addition to appropriate antibiotic therapy, prostatic abscesses can be treated surgically with marsupialization of the gland, placement of a drain, or prostatectomy. All of these surgical procedures are associated with significant complications. Castration should also be performed in dogs with prostatitis (Dorfman and Barsanti, 1995).",

Epithelial cells that are present may appear normal or hyperplastic as evidenced by increased cytoplasmic basophilia, increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, and mild anisokaryosis. Cellular atypia associated with prostatic epithelial cells in the presence of inflammation should be interpreted cautiously to avoid a false-positive diagnosis of neoplasia (Thrall et al., 1985).",

This chemopreventive effect may be partially mediated through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity causing the blockade of endogenous prostaglandin E2 production (Fan and de Lorimier, 2007). Canine normal prostatic tissues have failed to express COX-2 protein, but it was detected in 75% to 88% of prostatic carcinomas (L'Eplattenier et al., 2007).

The nuclearto-cytoplasmic ratio is often high and anisokaryosis and anisocytosis can be moderate to marked. Nuclei are round to pleomorphic and nucleoli are large, prominent, and often multiple. Binucleation may be noted. Adenocarcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma can be difficult to distinguish cytologically, and histopathology may be required for definitive diagnosis (Baker and Lumsden, 1999). Some acinar structures may be noted, which can help to differentiate the neoplasm from transitional cell carcinoma (Zinkl, 2008). Bell et al. (1991) reported that a diagnosis of neoplasia was established in 15 of 19 (79%) of samples submitted for cytologic analysis from dogs with histologically confirmed prostatic carcinoma. False-negative cytology results could have been related to small sample size, focal distribution of neoplastic lesions, or concurrent prostatitis and/or BPH. Serum and seminal plasma concentrations of acid phosphatase, prostate specific antigen and canine prostate specific esterase have not been shown to be useful in the definitive diagnosis of canine prostatic carcinoma (Gobello et al., 2002).",

Testicular germinal cells are generally round, with coarse nuclear chromatin, a single large, prominent nucleolus, and moderate amounts of basophilic cytoplasm (Figs. 12-57\nand 12-58\n). Mitotic activity is often high. More mature stages of developing sperm are characterized by oval, eosinophilic to pale-staining nuclei, and tails may be noted. Small groups of columnar cells, with indistinct cytoplasm and large round nuclei as single nucleoli, recognizable as Sertoli cells, can occasionally be evident. Scattered stellate or caudate Leydig cells, with microvacuolated cytoplasm and round nuclei are sometimes observed (Masserdotti et al., 2005).",

(Ladds, 1993). Orchitis and epididymitis are common in dogs with clinical patent leishmaniasis (Diniz et al., 2005). Intranuclear or intracytoplasmic inclusions may be seen in cases of distemper-associated orchitis (Ladds, 1993). Orchitis may also be associated with infection by the dimorphic yeast, Blastomyces dermatitidis. Orchitis has been recently reported in two dogs with Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Ober et al., 2004). Chronic purulent epididymitis associated with Mycoplasma canis infection has been described in one dog (L'Abee-Lund et al., 2003). In cats, orchitis or epididymitis is uncommon and orchitis has been associated with coronavirus infection in one cat (Sigurdardottir et al., 2001) and the isolation of Sporothrix schenckii from a testis in another cat (Schubach et al., 2002). Acute orchitis is characterized by a predominance of neutrophils, some of which may exhibit nuclear degenerative changes. Macrophages, including multinucleated giant cells and lymphocytes, may be seen in chronic inflammatory disease or fungal (blastomycosis) or protozoal (such as Leishmania infantum [Diniz et al., 2005]) infections. Since the infectious organisms are usually not observed cytologically, culture should be performed to identify the pathogens (Baker and Lumsden, 1999).",

However, the cytologist is occasionally presented with seminal material from dogs or cats with infertility or suspected testicular or prostatic disease; thus the ability to recognize certain abnormalities is useful. Gross evaluation, pH, and light microscopy such as concentration, motility, and morphology are routinely used to evaluate the principal parameters of dog and cat semen. Concentration is usually determined using a counting chamber. Aqueous-based Wright stain or Romanowsky-type stain is often used to assess sperm morphology. In high-quality semen, nearly all of the sperm should be of similar morphology. Spermatozoal abnormalities are considered as primary or secondary and described in Table 12-2\n. Primary abnormalities occur mostly during defective spermatogenesis and are therefore more serious. Secondary abnormalities may occur during passage through the epididymis (defective maturation) or during collection and preparation of the slide (see Table 12-2). Severe abnormalities include abnormal size or shape of the sperm head or acrosomal cap, proximal or midpiece protoplasmic droplets, and coiled tails (FIGURE 12-65, FIGURE 12-66, FIGURE 12-67\n). Less severe abnormalities include detached, normal-appearing heads and bent tails (Figs. 12-67 and 12-68\n). Normal semen samples should have less than 10% and 20% of primary and secondary abnormalities, respectively. Total canine and feline spermatozoal abnormalities should be less than 20% to 30% (Freshman, 2002).",

Normal cytology of the sperm-rich fraction contains spermatozoa, white blood cells (WBC) (2/hpf to 4/hpf), epithelial cells, bacteria, and red blood cells. Increased or degenerate neutrophils or macrophages or intracellular bacteria indicate inflammation and/or infection (Figs. 12-68 and 12-69\n). If neutrophils exhibit degenerative changes, a search for infectious organisms should be performed. However, culture of the fluid may be necessary for identification of pathogens due to the fact that 55% of clinically meaningful aerobic, anaerobic, or myoplasmic bacterial growth has noninflammatory seminal fluid cytology (Root Kustritz et al, 2005). Normal cytology of prostatic fluid is characterized by small amounts of epithelial cells, bacteria, and WBC (2/hpf to 4/hpf) (Freshman, 2002). Lower urinary tract inflammation and/or prostatitis should also be considered when inflammatory cells are present in semen. The presence of abnormal prostatic epithelium in the semen sample warrants further evaluation of the prostate gland (Zinkl, 2008).",

The most often used seminal markers are alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and carnitine. Both components originate from the epididymis in the dog and have the same application as markers of patency of ductal azoospermia. In an azoospermic semen sample, measurement of ALP or carnitine activity is essential in determining if the azoospermia is due to problems with libido, testicular failure, or ductal blockage. A low ALP or carnitine activity indicates ductal blockage whereas a normal ALP or carnitine activity indicates testicular failure (Gobello et al., 2002; Freshman, 2002).",
