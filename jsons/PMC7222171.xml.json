This antibody exhibits broadly neutralizing activity against genetically diverse HCV isolates. Epitope mapping showed that 8D6 targets a highly conserved epitope, which partially overlaps but is distinct from the epitopes recognized by AR3A and AR3C. A CX4C motif in the CDRH3 region of 8D6 was found to be critical for the neutralization activity of multiple bNAbs. Specific HCV strains that bind to inferred germline (iGL) Abs were identified. We hold the opinion that 8D6 not only has potential for prophylaxis of HCV infections but also represents a potential probe for developing a prophylactic HCV vaccine.",

We observed that 8D6 could also neutralize four clinical isolates, PR52B6mt (genotype 1b), PR26C3mt (genotype 1b), PR79L9 (genotype 1b) and PR63cc (genotype 2a), that were isolated from Chinese patients.11,12 Notably, 8D6 was highly active against PR63cc, which has been reported to be more resistant to an NS5A inhibitor (daclatasvir) than JFH1.12 AR3A also cross-neutralized all isolates evaluated in the assays. The neutralizing profiles of 8D6 and AR3A were differently dependent on the E1E2 context (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 4). Compared with 8D6, another isolated mAb, 8F6, exhibited lower breath and potency, as it failed to neutralize virus strains Con1 (genotype 1b) and S52 (genotype 3a) and weakly neutralized PR79, SA13, and HK6a with a relatively higher IC50 value, although it exhibited cross-binding activity with E2 (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d).",

The data showed that 8D6 significantly blocked HCV entry into hepatoma cells (Huh7.5.1) when 8D6 was incubated with HCV (JC1) for 1 h before infection. When added at 4 h after infection, 8D6 did not inhibit HCV infection efficiently and showed progressively decreasing activity compared with that observed for the pre-attachment step (Fig. 2a, b). These results suggested that the efficiency of 8D6 was dependent on the time of the intervention. Several cell membrane proteins are involved in HCV entry, of which CD81 binds to HCV E2 protein directly to mediate HCV entry. 13 As shown in Fig. 2c, both 8D6 and the positive control mAb AR3A could efficiently block E2 binding to CD81 in a dose-dependent manner.7 The data demonstrated that 8D6 mainly inhibits HCV entry by blocking E2 binding to the CD81 receptor.",

            "text": "To provide insight into the binding interface between 8D6 and the E2 protein, we performed epitope mapping by several methods. The previously described six bNAbs targeting five distinct clusters of epitopes on E1E2 were selected to serve as reference antibodies.4,7,10,14 First, we analyzed the binding activity of 8D6 with native and denatured recombinant E2 protein. 8D6 bound native E2 but did not bind the denatured form, indicating that it recognized a conformational epitope (Supplementary Fig. 5a). As bNAbs are more likely to target the conserved E2 core (E2c) rather than the highly variable regions (HVRs), which were reported to modulate the exposure of antibody epitopes on E2 and their ability to prevent E2-CD81 interactions, 15 we tested the ability of the 8D6 mAb to bind HVR-deleted E2c proteins. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 5b, the binding activity of 8D6 to E2 was not affected when the three HVRs were deleted, indicating that 8D6 recognized the core conserved domain within the E2 protein. To determine the binding sites of 8D6, we further performed competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) between 8D6 and a panel of previously described bNAbs. The data showed that 8D6, AR3A, and AR3C cross competed with each other, indicating that their epitopes are in close proximity or overlap on the surface of E2. The 8D6 and AR3 antibodies could block the binding of HC84.27 specifically directed against a short peptide located in the E2 protein between residues 427 and 446 (AS434).16 However, 8D6 and AR3 antibodies could not be competed by HC84.27, which might be owing to the binding interface of 8D6 and AR3 antibodies being wider than that of HC84.27. In addition, 8D6 did not cross-compete with AP33, AR4A or AR5A. (Fig. 3a). Next, we determined the amino-acid residues of E2 that were critical for 8D6 binding by alanine-mutagenesis scanning (Fig. 3b). In this experiment, the critical residues L413, N415, G418, and W420 were correctly identified as the epitope targeted by the well-characterized mAb AP33, indicating that the assay was reliable.17 According to the alanine-mutagenesis scanning results, some residues located on the back layer of E2 and the Ig \u03b2 sandwich core were critical for E2 binding to all three conformation-dependent bNAbs. These mutations also influenced the binding activities of other conformation-sensitive mAbs targeting E2, suggesting that they may affect global folding of E1E2, not directly involved in mAb interactions.18 Thus, the discontinuous epitope targeted by 8D6 was likely to be formed by at least two segments, which were composed of a serpentine stretch of residues 421\u2013448 in the front layer and a portion of the CD81 receptor-binding loop, and these segments are also involved in the interaction between E2 and CD81.14,18 We demonstrated that residues T425, L427, C429, G436, L438, N448, G530, and D535 were probably involved in the binding of 8D6 to E2. Notably, the binding activity of these E2 mutants to CD81 was significantly reduced, except for the N448A mutation (Fig. 3c), suggesting that most of the identified residues targeted by 8D6 are critical for the interaction between the E2 protein and CD81.",

Although the binding epitope of 8D6 overlapped with those of AR3A and AR3C, there were differences in specificity for antibody recognition, particularly in the front layer. We showed that a highly conserved N-linked glycosylation site, N448, contributed to the E2c-8D6 interaction but did not affect AR3A and AR3C binding. We also generated the N448D mutation to knock out the glycan at N448 in Con1 soluble E2. As shown in Fig. 3d, the WT sample migrated as a diffuse band owing to glycan modification heterogeneity. The N448 substitution resulted in a band below that of WT, suggesting possible glycosylation at N448. Both N448A and N448D did not bind 8D6 but showed binding with AR3A and AR3C, indicating that the glycan at N448 may be involved in 8D6 recognition (Fig. 3e). Resistance to 8D6 was conferred by the introduction of the N448A/N448D mutation into the JC1 clone (Supplementary Fig. 7). The bNAbs HEPC3 and HEPC74 isolated from individuals who spontaneously cleared HCV infection were also demonstrated to recognize the glycan at N448 by structural analysis.19",

We produced a series of 8D6 variants with each somatic mutation individually reverted to the germline-encoded mAb sequence and examined their binding activities to a panel of E2 proteins (Fig. 4c). Notably, a significant loss of binding for all tested E2 proteins was observed with the substitution of C109 with S in the CDRH3 loop. In addition, an individual reversion of the somatic mutation in all three CDRLs had minor effects. We also performed quantitative kinetic binding analysis of the 8D6 variants using the purified sE2 protein of the Con1 strain (Supplementary Fig. 10c). The results were consistent with those shown in Fig. 4c. These findings indicate that the broad antiviral activity of 8D6 was acquired through only a few somatic hypermutations, in particular, an S to C mutation at position 109 in CDRH3, indicating that 8D6-competing antibodies could be elicited more efficiently with suitable immunogens and strategies. Genetic analyses further showed that the 8D6 VH has a long template-independent addition of nucleotides (N nucleotides) at the VD joint introduced by V-(D)-J rearrangement, resulting in a cysteine at position 104 (Supplementary Fig. 9b, c). We predicted that cysteines 104 and 109 form a CX4C disulfide motif in CDRH3, which is a common strategy for 8D6 neutralization of different genotypes of HCV. To further demonstrate the importance of the CX4C motif for 8D6, we tested the binding and neutralizing activity of single C109A and C104A and double Cys to Ala mutants. All the mutants displayed reduced binding to 1b/Con1 E2 and a panel of E2 proteins by ELISA, with the C109A mutants showing the weakest binding (Supplementary Fig. 11a, b). The mutants also displayed reduced neutralization potencies against a panel of HCVcc strains (Fig. 4d).",

The iGL S109C mutant also partially restored iGL neutralizing activity against a panel of HCVcc strains (Fig. 4e). It is possible that the single cysteine in CDRH3 drives 8D6 iGL somatic hypermutation, which contributes to a gradual increase in affinity for E2. Somatic hypermutation of Ig variable regions requires the activity of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, which favors canonical WRC (W = A or T, R = A or G) hot spot motifs.24 Interestingly, there are two WRC hot spots in germline IGHD5-18*01, where four somatic mutations were coincidentally introduced into 8D6 (Supplementary Fig. 9c). Thus, the codon AGC encoding serine is biased to be mutated to TGC encoding cysteine with only one nucleotide change through somatic hypermutation.",

We constructed single and double amino-acid substitutions in the CX4C motif in AR3A, AR3C, and HC84.22, and tested the binding and neutralizing activity of the mutants. The results showed that the binding and neutralizing activity of single and double Cys mutants decreased compared with those of their original antibodies, indicating the important contribution of this motif to the interaction of this series of bNAbs with E2. Furthermore, 8D6, AR3A, and AR3C carrying two Cys mutations in CDRH3 displayed higher binding and neutralizing activity than single Cys mutants. The mutation of only one residue of the proposed cysteine pair may result in a conformational change of CDRH3, which might be responsible for their poor binding activity. In contrast, HC84.22 carrying double Cys mutants completely lost its neutralizing activity and ability to bind E2, suggesting that it might use a different conformation of disulfide-stabilized CDRH3 to recognize E2 (Supplementary Fig. 11a\u2013c).",

In contrast, the binding of the antigenic site comprising amino acids 412\u2013423 (AS412)-specific antibody AP33 could not be blocked by either chronically or acutely infected patient plasma. Antibody binding to AS412 has been reported to be rare in HCV-infected patients.27 The plasma from patients with acute infection contained limited 8D6- and AR3C-competing-Ab responses, which may be owing to low antibody titers (Supplementary Fig. 12) or low affinity without long-term maturation. However, one out of 10 subjects who spontaneously cleared HCV infection could significantly suppress 8D6-binding activity (82%), indicating that certain patients with spontaneously cleared infection could produce 8D6- and AR3-competing bNAbs. HEPC3 or HEPC74 targeting overlapping epitopes have been isolated from individuals who spontaneously cleared HCV.23,28 Therefore, our study together with previous studies indicated that 8D6-competing antibodies might be induced in many persistently HCV-infected patients and certain patients who spontaneously cleared HCV infection, thus representing a reproducible class of neutralizing antibodies that provide theoretical support for human HCV vaccine research.",

To facilitate rational vaccine design and induce similar bNAbs in human subjects in a reproducible manner, it is necessary to understand how bNAbs, such as 8D6, developed from their unmutated common ancestor during natural infection. We demonstrated that the broad antiviral activity and high affinity of 8D6 was acquired through only a few somatic mutations. In particular, a somatic hypermutation-induced cysteine at position 109 of CDRH3 in 8D6 and a V(D)J recombination-generated cysteine at position 104 formed a CX4C motif that made a key contribution to the 8D6 interaction with E2. Furthermore, based on our findings, we characterized a series of prototype bNAbs that targeted a similar discontinuous surface, and all these antibodies retained a conserved C-X-X-X-G-C motif in CDRH3. The motif may exert two functions: involvement in the direct association with residues on E2 and maintenance of the required intramolecular 3D structure of CDRH3 for epitope detection. Previous structural and functional studies have shown that this motif is critical for the interaction between antibodies and helix \u03b11 in the E2c front layer.14,19 To date, the disulfide motif in CDRH3 is mainly encoded in IGHD2 germline alleles, such as those of AR3C, HEPC3, and HEPC74. Based on our study, the cysteine pair can be produced combinatorially by VDJ recombination and somatic hypermutation of certain DHs with a codon bias towards mutation to cysteine.32,33 Our results suggest that the junctional residues introduced by V-D-J rearrangement could affect subsequent somatic hypermutation and thus determine the maturation pathway of an antibody.34,35 Identifying the mechanism by which bNAbs from different individuals recognize the same antigenic epitope on the virus may provide valuable information for both immunogen design and immunization strategy design in HCV vaccine research.",

In this study, we demonstrated that PR79L9 was much more sensitive to 8D6 iGL than other selected HCV strains, including 1b/Con1, in both the recombinant virus neutralizing assay and the soluble E2 ELISA-binding assay (Fig. 5b, c). The interaction between PR79L9 and 8D6 iGL is CDRH3 disulfide motif independent, whereas for the HEPC3/AR3C family of HCV bNAbs, the CDRH3 disulfide motif is essential for initial germline recognition of HCV by naive B cells.19,21 These studies have provided key proof that E2 from certain isolates favorably reacts with germline B-cell receptors of the 8D6 antibody; thus, it is possible to engineer these immunogens to target the 8D6 and other bNAb precursors and expand these specific antibody lineages.",

First, the human immune system may be primed by a related B-cell precursor-stimulating antigen. Second, based on the results of our investigation using a patient plasma competition ELISA (Fig. 5a), the next step would be boosting with more diverse immunogens that resemble other genotype E2 variants to guide the somatic mutations in the VH and VL chains towards increased breadth and potency. These hypotheses should be verified in animal systems expressing human antibody repertoires.38 Collectively, our findings on the potent and broad neutralizing activity achieved by 8D6 provide additional evidence for rational antibody-based HCV vaccine design.",

The glycans were removed from the E2 crystal structure for simplicity. Since a high-resolution structure of the 8D6 Fab was not available, its coordinates were adapted from the AR3C Fab of the same protein complex structure (PDB accession number: 4mwf) with modifications. Using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 1.2r3pre, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC), residues D30, N31, and Y32 in AR3C Fab HCDR1, L53 and F54 in HCDR2 and 97TPRYCGGGFCYGE in HCDR3 were mutated to the corresponding sequences of the 8D6 Fab (I30, T31, P32, N53, T54, and 100RIFSCRRGTCYGG, respectively).

The ambiguous interaction restraints were derived from antigen\u2013antibody interaction competition studies and alanine-scanning mutagenesis, as described above.
