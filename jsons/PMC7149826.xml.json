            "text": "In considering the ecology of the avian viruses and their impact on life on earth, it may be useful to first consider the host itself. The class Aves first diverged from the reptiles between 150 and 300 million years ago, depending on which current paleontological interpretations one accepts. Of the vertebrate classes, they are most often compared with the reptiles from which they evolved and with mammals because of their common warm-blooded nature. This shared feature with mammals is probably the most influential with respect to ecology, since a virus adapted to warm-blooded physiology would not fare well in the cold-blooded world, and vice versa. Along these lines, our recent experience is that some virologists think that a bird is a bird, and that if a given virus replicates in one, it will replicate in them all. This is, of course, far from the truth and perhaps should be a starting point for discussing avian virus ecology.",

            "text": "According to fossil records, the class Aves emerged from the extinctions of the Late Cretaceous period 65,000,000 years ago, somewhat bottlenecked, as did the class Mammalia, but since that time they have undergone parallel evolution with mammals and are equally diverse in their own right. Certainly some viruses, such as avian paramyxovirus 1 (of which Newcastle disease virus is the prototype), are infectious for numerous orders of birds. There are also other important avian virus strains such as the gallid herpesvirus 1 (infectious laryngotracheitis) and the Avihepadnaviridae, which appear to be exclusively confined to a single bird family or even genus. It is clear that birds, because of their close association with powered flight, do present a more homogeneous anatomy and physiology than do the class Mammalia (Feduccia, 1996). Whether this affects or specifies the molecular nature of viruses that infect birds is not really known. This feature, however, almost certainly uniquely impacts the natural distribution and ecology of the viruses that inhabit the flying birds. A virus infecting or persisting in an arctic tern could potentially be translocated up to 12,000 miles in a few weeks. Viruses such as some avian orthomyxovirus or avian paramyxovirus strains, which may exhibit subclinical infections, might be shared among a migrating flock of waterfowl and persist for indefinite periods as the flocks move from lake to lake. Along the way the virus might be shared with other birds crossing flight paths. So birds do present unique environments for transmission of viruses.",

The order Galliformes in particular, which includes domestic and wild fowl; pheasants, quail, and turkeys, has been unquestionably affected. It would be quite safe to say that humans have both determined and upset the ecological balance among members of this order and the viruses that affect them. Due to continuous breeding practices, live-virus vaccination regimes, and by housing tens of thousands of birds in a single enclosure, situations never encountered in natural settings are created. Whether this has affected the virus-host ecological balance in other orders of undomesticated birds as well is not known; but it would seem highly likely.",

While there are similarities shared with respect to the immune system, particularly the dual (humoral and cell-mediated) nature, there are marked differences between cold- and warm-blooded vertebrates and additional significant differences between birds and mammals (Eerola et al., 1987). The discovery of processing and maturation of immunoglobulin-producing lymphocytes was made as a result of characterization of an avian-specific organ, the Bursa of Fabricius (Ratcliffe, 1989). Although functional equivalents exist in mammals, the bursa is a distinct and wholly avian-specific organ. Since several viruses are known to affect this organ specifically, it should be considered a unique ecological niche.",

            "text": "A second significant difference in the immune system of birds is in the apparent genetic content responsible for specifying the avian major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The chicken MHC appears considerably more simple (providing the oxymoron: a simpler complex) than the mammalian MHC (Kaufman and Wallny, 1996). Several alleles have arisen and considerable recombination documented in the mammalian MHCs that thus far have been studied. These are responsible for producing a great variety of class I-, II-, and III-type proteins used in recognition and presentation of antigen. In the chicken, some MHC haplotypes produce only one type of class I protein and there is no evidence for recombination at all (Kaufman and Wallny, 1996). This has led to speculation that the relationship with the avian pathogens has evolved significantly differently from the mammals. One result of this difference may be the occurrence and frequency of either resistance or sensitivity to specific viral infections encountered in chickens (see below). Thus, the class Aves presents several unique features that might ultimately affect the ecology of viruses that infect them.",

            "text": "The classification of birds has presented a significant challenge to systematists. The number of species has actually decreased over the years because of the clearer genetic relationships that have emerged. Conversely, additional species have been defined as recognition of convergent evolution has become clearer. Currently, new species are identified at a rate of about two per year. While there remains some disagreement among specialists, most accept the current classification of 30 orders, 174 families, 2044 genera, and 9020+ species (Gill, 1990). Molecular analysis of avian genes for phylogenetic studies is still in its early stages. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and sequence analysis of 12S mitochondria DNA has yielded some molecular phylogenetic information but not enough to gain any insight regarding the viruses of birds (Hedges et al., 1996; Cooper and Penny, 1997; Mindell et al., 1997). Roughly speaking, the flightless orders represented by ostriches, rheas, cassowaries, and kiwis are thought to be the most ancient, while the bewildering array of members of the order Passeriformes (representing 60% of known species and 40% of known families) are thought to be the most recent (Gill, 1990). Trying to determine how long viruses have been associated with various avian groups is of course as impossible as it is with virus\u2013host relationships in any other classes. Orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses have recently been isolated from ostriches, rheas, and emus, indicating no absolute barriers in these more ancient birds.",

These are the Iridoviridae, Arenoviridae, African swine fever-like viruses, and Filoviridae. A similar comparison of families that do not contain a mammalian member yields only the Birnaviridae. So, in one sense, the mammalian host might be considered more virus-friendly, rather than the alternative. Still, many investigators think of bird tissues, in particular the embryo, as being an ideal medium for identifying new viruses. If just from an experimental and practical, rather than a natural, point of view, the avian host has played a tremendous role in our understanding of viral ecology. Many of the most important findings in virology have been made utilizing the chicken embryo and in chicken cell cultures. The egg also continues to provide an abundant and important substrate for the production of veterinary and human vaccines.",

We try and make them more familiar by defining higher organism-type genetic alterations as \u201cevolution,\u201d when in truth the viruses may simply be adapting to the evolutionary pressures encountered by, or within, its host. Obviously, the host is central to the viruses\u2019 lifestyle and must be considered a major part of virus ecology. In this sense, information gathered on various viruses as they replicate in embryos or embryo cells, in the absence of immune pressure, should only be considered \u201cnatural\u201d for those viruses that are transmitted vertically. The embryo or cell culture then can only provide a window on the natural ecology of the organism in which the immune system is not a factor.

The disease then progresses into a lymphoproliferative phase in susceptible birds that can range in severity depending on the virus strain and breed of chickens. Some breeds have shown natural resistance to this progression, and, although the mechanism of resistance is not completely understood, it involves primarily lymphoid tissue and is dictated mostly by genes involved in the immune response (Venugopal and Payne, 1995).

Infections in turkeys and pheasants have been reported, but surveys have yielded no wild bird reservoir or other domestic poultry reservoir (Cranshaw and Boycott, 1982). Based on this and the knowledge that ILT apparently exhibits little antigenic heterogeneity, it has been proposed that through proper husbandry practices and appropriate vaccination techniques the disease could be eliminated from commercial poultry (Bagust and Johnson, 1998). The virus is a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily and is identified taxonomically as gallid herpesvirus I. The disease is almost exclusively respiratory, with no systemic involvement. The severity of disease can vary from significant mortality (70%) in young birds to an inapparent infection of adult birds. There are age-dependent effects on the pathognomonic signs, and there do appear to be strain-specific virulence differences. However, different isolates do not exhibit sufficient genetic heterogeneity thus far to identify specific virulence factors (Bagust and Guy, 1997). The most interesting aspect of ILT is its capacity for persistence in infected birds and flocks showing no disease signs. This persistence is most likely due to establishment of the latent state and recrudescence. Numerous studies have demonstrated re-isolation of virus many months after initial infection, and one more recent study demonstrated reactivation of latent virus due to stress factors (Hughes et al., 1989). This latency achieved by herpesviruses could certainly be considered a unique ecological state, and most herpesvirus infections in birds are associated with its establishment.",

Lymphomas caused by MDV and retroviruses are still the most common viral neoplastic diseases of poultry, and a recent increase in mortality and evolution of more virulent MDV strains indicates that the impact of these viruses will continue to be felt (Witter, 1996). Marek's disease is caused by a herpesvirus that has two very similar relatives: a second nononcogenic serotype and the herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT). These are sometimes classified as serotypes 1\u20133, respectively, of the gallid herpesvirus II strain. They share common antigens that distinguish them from the nononcogenic herpesviruses but can be distinguished on the basis of antigenic differences (Calnek and Witter, 1997). Only the oncogenic MDVs (serotype 1) cause significant problems in commercial poultry. The herpesvirus of turkeys is ubiquitous among commercial flocks and quite prevalent in wild turkeys but has not been directly associated with disease. The serotype 2 strains were originally thought to be nononcogenic apathogenic MDV isolates until they were serologically distinguished from the original isolates. The type 2 serotypes are associated with subclinical infections in chickens, although not as prevalent as turkey strains.",

The first transmissible lymphomas were demonstrated in 1908 by Ellermann and Bang (1908) and the first cell-free transmissible solid tumor by Peyton Rous three years later (Rous, 1911). The etiologic agents of both of these diseases were later shown to be members of what is now known as the avian leukosis virus-avian sarcoma virus complex (ALV\u2013ASV) of related retroviruses. Scientists investigating this interesting group of viruses have garnered more Nobel Prizes (six) than with any other group. Because of their relative simplicity in genetic content and their close association with the genetic character of their host, they have provided a bountiful model for the study of oncogenesis. These are RNA-containing viruses that replicate via an intermediate DNA stage that is most often incorporated into the host genome. The integrated viral genomes serve as templates for production of new progeny genomic RNA molecules and the mRNAs needed to make new viral proteins (Coffin, 1996). In the process, these viruses transform the host cell into a tumor cell. There is a significant array of viral subtypes and relationships that exist between the host and avian retroviruses and numerous reviews that may be consulted (Crittenden, 1981; Swanstrom and Vogt, 1990). There are several viral subgroups, based on antigenic differences alone, in the surface envelope glycoproteins. Viral subtypes have also been grouped on the basis of whether the viruses rapidly induce neoplasia because of the presence of a viral oncogene, or whether they induce slow development of tumors due to their integration into the host genome and subsequent activation of cellular oncogenes. In commercial poultry, the predominant problems are caused by the latter, the slow-inducing lymphoid leukosis viruses (LLVs). The sarcoma-, myeloblastosis-, and erythroblastosis-inducing strains cause only sporadic problems. Additionally, it has been calculated that losses due to LLV because of poultry performance decreases are actually greater than those due to the lymphomas. Still, these viruses continue to cause condemnations at slaughter and must be distinguished from the more rapidly forming MDV-induced lymphomas.",

The relatively new subgroup \u201cJ\u201d has been characterized in Europe as causing significant myelocytoma and endothelioma. In contrast to the LLVs, subgroup J viruses have a high tropism for cells of the myelomonocytic series but a very low tropism for bursal cells (Arshad et al., 1997). A related subgroup J virus has been identified in broiler\u2013breeder flocks in the United States as well (Smith et al., 1997). Additionally, of note are those retroviruses of the reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) group. Infection with members of this group only rarely results in disease, and then disease most commonly occurs only in the hosts from which REV was first isolated: turkeys. Still the REV group is predicted to have significant potential for causing problems in poultry (Witter and Johnson, 1985), and the wide host range of the virus group has prompted speculation regarding potential as a public health risk. There are, in fact, data demonstrating antibodies to the virus in human and other mammalian sera (Johnson et al., 1998).",

            "text": "Coronaviruses contain a large positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 30 kb. Members of this virus family infect both mammals and birds (Cavanagh et al., 1994). Infectious bronchitis, caused by a Coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), is one of the major poultry viral diseases of worldwide economic importance. It is also one of the most rapidly spreading avian respiratory diseases known (McMartin, 1993). The virus is antigenically variable owing to a high mutation rate in the surface glycoprotein S gene. New antigenic variants of IBV continue to be isolated from various geographic regions. Thus far, it has not been possible to determine the number of distinct IBV subtypes, but there are at least six (Siddell, 1995). Strains can differ in their virulence and tissue tropism, but in general the disease is a rapid-onset respiratory distress that can cause significant mortality in young birds. In established flocks, the infection is often associated with growth retardation and reduction in egg production that may be exacerbated by other respiratory pathogens. Estimates of a 10 to 20% loss in market value have been made for a typical outbreak in a flock. Vaccination is employed to control the disease, and an interesting related feature is the demonstration that vaccine strains can undergo recombination with wild-type strains. Consequently, new IBV antigenic variants of the S1 gene emerge with characteristics of both viruses (Cavanagh et al., 1992; Wang et al., 1993). IBV is also an excellent example of a virus exquisitely adapted to its host, as it is not found naturally in any other reservoir. Chickens seem to be the only reservoir, and the virus is capable of persisting in some manner within populations and later being transmitted to naive flocks. Evidence suggests the mode is primarily airborne transmission. In controlled studies, birds in houses 115 feet away from an experimentally \u201cseeded\u201d house were infected via aerosol transmission (McMartin, 1993), and circumstantial data from natural outbreaks suggest transmission over distances of several hundred yards (Cumming, 1970).",

Coronaviruses have been isolated from ratites with enteric disease in zoological collections, but the relationship of these isolates with the turkey coronavirus (TCV) has not been investigated (Frank and Carpenter, 1992; Kennedy and Brenneman, 1995). Transmission of TCV appears to be restricted to the fecal-oral route, although cell-free lysates of the bursa from infected birds can be used to transmit the agent orally. Among turkey flocks, the primary mode of transmission of coronaviral enteritis is via contaminated personnel and equipment. However, since TCV is excreted in fecal material and is very stable, it is conceivable that wild birds may serve as vectors for the agent. Morbidity is usually as high as 100%, with mortality becoming as high as 50% in an infected turkey flock. Mortality among poults may be much higher with increased numbers of secondary bacterial gastrointestinal infections contributing to severity of disease.",

Joklik, when asked what in the world he thought they meant in the grand scheme of biology, replied (and I paraphrase), \u201cthey represent an evolutionary step forward in the establishment of the ideal genetic material.\u201d The reoviruses have fascinated virologists for some time. They have an unusual and complex replication strategy, are able to undergo reassortment of their genes, and are curious in that they retain their infecting subviral cores as their RNA replication template. Reoviruses are also quite stable outside the host, remaining viable for up to a year at room temperature (Nibert et al., 1996). The mammalian strains have a wide host range but are found without any associated clinical signs, the origin of the name REO (respiratory and enteric orphan) telling most of the story. In poultry, several antigenic subtypes have been identified, and the virus can be classified based on serotyping and virulence, but there is no unified typing scheme as yet (Kawamura and Tsubahara, 1960; Robertson and Wilcox, 1986). The most severe and common pathology associated with reoviruses is arthritis\u2013tenosynovitis, although associations with other clinical syndromes including respiratory and enteric disorders have been described (Rosenberger and Olson, 1997). Often, the clinical states are influenced by the presence of other pathogens. Arthritis is a significant problem in birds but primarily only in young chicks and turkey poults. Other Reoviridae in birds include several members of the genera Orbivirus (arboviruses; see below) and Rotavirus, which have been associated with a runting\u2013stunting syndrome in chickens.",

They were difficult to classify for many years because of their cell-associated nature and slow replication in cell culture systems. Currently, two serotypes (1 and 2) are accepted, with significant antigenic variation and numerous proposed subtypes within each serotype (McFerran et al., 1980; Jackwood and Saif, 1987). Chickens are the only animals known to develop disease and lesions when naturally infected by avibirnaviruses. Both serotypes are distributed worldwide, but serotype 1 strains are the only ones associated with pathogenicity and immunosuppression. The bursa is the primary target organ, and strains of differing virulence have been identified. The disease is most significantly manifested when young birds are infected and permanent immunosuppression results. This sets the stage for subsequent severe viral and bacterial infections later in life. Interestingly, IBD is an example where maternal antibodies derived by either vaccinations or natural infections provide significant immune protection. Highly virulent strains of these viruses exist in various countries worldwide, and there are indications that new virulent variants do arise in the face of immune pressure (Chettle et al., 1989b).",

            "text": "Avian adenoviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses containing 30\u201310 genes. These viruses can be loosely divided into three groups based on antigenic relationships of internal proteins (McFerran, 1997), although the three groups have not been officially recognized by the ICTV. The avian group I adenoviruses include at least 12 serologically distinct types, all of which have been isolated from mildly or asymptomatic poultry. The type species is known as the CELO (chick embryo lethal orphan), or Phelps strain, or F1 (fowl) strain. There are also numerous isolates from other avian species plus electron microscopy and immunological evidence that the type I aviadenoviruses are widely distributed in birds. By themselves, these viruses present no particular clinical problems in commercial poultry, but they are thought to cause significant problems in mixed infections with immunosuppressive viruses such as IBDV and chick infectious anemia virus (CIAV). A virus virtually indistinguishable from the CELO strain known as quail bronchitis virus (QBV) can be devastating in commercial quail operations, causing as high as 80% mortality (DuBose and Grumbles, 1959; Montreal, 1992). Virus isolations and significant antibody levels in wild quail suggest that the virus may present disease problems in nature (King et al., 1981), although there are no documented cases or epizootics.",

Infections caused by this virus group appear to target lymphoid tissue, often resulting in immunosuppression, and there are strain-specific differences in virulence among the various group II isolates (Pierson and Domermuth, 1997). HEV reached epidemic proportions in the 1960s and still causes significant problems in turkey-producing states in the United States and elsewhere. MSDV is a significant pathogen in confinement pheasant operations, causing significant economic losses. AAS is virtually ubiquitous among chicken flocks in the United States, in which case mild respiratory signs and splenomegaly are occasionally associated. The syndrome is similar to the disease state observed in pheasants, but in general AAS virus causes no significant problems among chickens. Evidence indicates that these group II avian adenoviruses are limited to the order Galliformes, and that wild bird populations (even wild turkeys) are unaffected.",

The disease has caused significant egg production losses mostly in the Eurasian and Australian-Pacific poultry markets. A virus named EDS76, which has been found associated with this syndrome, may have been originally introduced via a contaminated vaccine, but it seems clear now that sporadic cases are initiated by introduction of the causative virus from domestic and wild waterfowl, mostly ducks and geese. When endemic in flocks, the virus is transmitted vertically and exhibits a latent phase, which is reactivated in laying hens, usually after egg production begins. The virus initially appears to replicate in lymphoid tissues but rapidly moves to the oviduct, where replication causes inflammation and production of aberrant eggs. Unlike other avian adenoviruses, the group III strains do not replicate in the intestinal mucosa. It is likely that EDS76 virus or very similar strains are present ubiquitously in wild ducks and geese, but rarely appear to be associated with disease (McFerran, 1997).",

            "text": "The avipoxviruses are widely distributed throughout the class Aves, having been isolated from some 60 species representing 20 avian taxonomic families. The avipoxviruses are responsible for economically important disease problems in commercial poultry and aviaries (Tripathy, 1993). They may cause a slowly developing cutaneous disease with low mortality or, conversely, significant mortality, and generalized infections when in the diphtheritic form on mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract and associated areas. These large DNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of the cell, where they form characteristic inclusion bodies within rapidly proliferating nodular lesions. The poxviruses may be transmitted by mechanical means such as introduction from poultry workers into abrasions in the skin of uninfected poultry. There is also real evidence for transmission of the disease by mosquitos and other vectors such as mites in close conditions, where the number of diseased birds is high. The avipoxviruses can also apparently establish a latent state and be naturally or chemically induced to reactivate (Kirmse, 1967b). Cutaneous lesions containing infectious virus persistent for more than a year have also been documented in wild birds (Kirmse, 1967a). Variant strains of avipoxviruses have since been isolated from previously vaccinated flocks that were experiencing significant mortality from the diphtheritic form of the disease (Tripathy and Reed, 1997). This suggests that, similar to Marek's disease, vaccination against poxviruses may ultimately lead to escape of more virulent forms of the viruses. The avipoxviruses are also considered one of the most promising DNA virus vectors for delivery of recombinant poultry vaccines, and poxvirus-vectored vaccines against Newcastle disease and avian influenza have been licensed.",

The natural isolate is enterotropic and is transmitted horizontally (orally) and vertically. There is a gradient of pathology dependent on the age of infection of young chicks. Pre-immune chicks from non-immune parents will generally die if infected within 1 to 2 days of hatch. If infected between 2 and 8 days of age, they may live but exhibit significant nervous involvement (encephalomyelitis). If infected beyond that age, they may exhibit enteric pathology but not neural signs. At adulthood or full immunocompetence, they may be infected but refractory to any clinical signs.

Purified virus inoculated into young chicks results in severe anemia and immunosuppression, but inoculation of 2- to 3-week old birds results in little if any pathology (Yuasa and Imai, 1986). The virus has been associated with adult anemic conditions, however, in conjunction with other viral and bacterial infections and may thus play a significant role. The agent is widespread in commercial poultry flocks worldwide, and infection with the virus has been statistically related to a decrease in overall growth and performance (Chettle et al., 1989a). The extent to which two other tentative members of the family Circoviridae \u2014 psittacine beak-and-feather disease virus (BFDV) and porcine circovirus \u2014 are related to CIAV is under question, and these stated taxonomic relationships may differ in the future. BFDV has proven to be a significant pathogen in aviaries and commercial in psittacine birds to the extent that vaccines are now routinely administered. Recent evidence also suggests that Circovirus particles can be detected by EM and isolated from several other wild and captive bird species. Consequently, the Circoviridae may emerge as a more significant disease-causing agent in the near future.",

Interestingly, caliciviruses have been detected in pelagic birds, such as the white tern (Poet et al., 1994).

They cause or are associated with three infections in birds (Kisary, 1993). In wild and domestic geese and Muscovy ducks, Derzy's disease refers to a syndrome that had been variously called goose influenza, goose hepatitis, gosling enteritis, and infectious myocarditis in different countries. This collection of names gives some indication of the variety of signs associated with Derzy's disease. The virus, which can be transmitted horizontally and vertically, induces differing pathologies depending on the age of the bird and, in the case of hatchlings, the level of maternal antibodies. An interesting pathology often associated with infection of older birds is the virtually complete loss of feathers. The extreme stability of the parvoviruses makes control of this disease difficult in commercial operations worldwide, and the disease can result in 100% mortality in young hatchlings.",

Worldwide dissemination of the disease, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s, has been attributed to increased international trade of both commercial poultry and pet birds. This led to development of inactivated and live-virus vaccines for commercial poultry.

Virulent forms of NDV can replicate within cultures of most avian and mammalian cell types without the addition of trypsin, while lentogens require added proteases for replication in cell culture. The presence of dibasic amino acids at the proteolytic cleavage site (PCS) of the viral fusion protein and the ability of cellular proteases to cleave the fusion protein of various pathotypes specify the molecular basis for NDV virulence. Fewer basic amino acids are present in the fusion protein cleavage site of lentogenic NDV than is the case for mesogenic or velogenic isolates. The presence of the increased number of dibasic amino acids in the fusion protein PCS sequence of NDV allows for systemic replication of these more pathogenic viruses in the host (Nagai et al., 1976).",

Outbreaks during 1990 and 1992 occurred in the north central United States and south central Canada, while in 1997 Newcastle disease occurred among cormorants of the western United States and Canada. Mortality in young nestlings in some areas was as high as 80 to 90%, and the affected birds had characteristic neurotropic lesions (Heckert et al., 1996). During the 1992 outbreak in cormorants, an unvaccinated North Dakota turkey flock became infected with NDV, resulting in high mortality. Using nucleotide sequence analysis, the virus causing disease in turkeys was proven to be the same virus isolated from afflicted cormorants in the central United States and Canada. The cormorant virus was also phylogenetically related to other known NDV isolates of psittacine origin (Seal et al., 1995) that had caused a major outbreak in Southern California poultry during the early 1970s that resulted in a depopulation of two million chickens (Utterback and Schwartz, 1973).",

            "text": "In chickens, introduction of influenza viruses from waterfowl has been more devastating. In the northeastern United States, the H5 subtype caused the first large-scale outbreak of highly pathogenic AI in numerous flocks in 1983. Twenty-three million birds were destroyed at a cost of more than $65,000,000 in order to contain the infection. Clinically, the disease was indistinguishable from the disease originally described as \u201cfowl plague\u201d in 1927 in Europe (Eckroade and Silverman, 1986). Today we know that all of the classical \u201cfowl plague\u201d-type outbreaks have been associated exclusively with only two subtypes: H5 and H7. Evolution to virulence in these subtypes has been closely associated with accumulation of basic amino acids at the proteolytic cleavage site of the hemagglutinin protein (Bosch et al., 1981; Webster and Rott, 1987). In order for AIV strains to be infectious, the HA protein must be cleaved into HA1 and HA2 subunits, which subsequently allows structural rearrangement and exposure of a protein sequence needed to fuse the viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the target cell (Klenk et al., 1975; Skehel et al., 1995). Isolates of low pathogenicity lack multiple basic amino acids and are only cleaved by trypsin-like extracellular proteases. These proteases are abundant on the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract and gut, so the viruses replicate unrestricted at these sites. The highly pathogenic (HP) forms, however, have additional basic amino acids, which are recognized by the intracellular furin-like proteases ubiquitous in bird tissues (Rott et al., 1995). Thus, in birds, these viruses are able to escape the respiratory tract and infect a wider variety of internal tissues and organs. This is one of the most important of the virulence factors (Webster and Rott, 1987). Only two subtypes have been shown to accumulate these basic amino acids: H7 and H5. These subtypes appear to do so by either base substitution or by insertion events (Wood et al., 1993; Perdue et al., 1997). Nucleotide insertion events appear to be the most common mechanism, and Table II\nand Figure 3\nillustrate what is presently known about occurrence of these HP virus isolates in commercial poultry. The HP isolates, with only two exceptions, have additional inserted basic amino acids within the well-conserved region surrounding the cleavage site. From the data in Table II and Figure 3, it may be easily surmised that both the number of HP isolates and the number of basic amino acids at the cleavage site are increasing.",

Surveys have shown that, in addition to the viruses being widespread, the various subtypes increase and decrease in prevalence over successive years. The order Charadriiformes (shorebirds and allies), in addition to Anseriiformes, has been shown to carry AIV strains (Kawaoka et al., 1988), and the extent to which AIVs are carried in other orders has really only been superficially explored. Molecular and phylogenetic evidence have clearly shown that these segmented viruses share various genes back and forth within the populations of circulating virus strains (Garcia et al., 1997). They are also capable of donating genes through genetic reassortment to viruses in swine and those genes ultimately end up in humans (Webster et al., 1993). Add this capacity to the known (albeit rare) transmission of purely avian influenza strains directly into mammals and one creates a potential ecological bonanza for the virus, and potential nightmares for new hosts.",

In the case of the avian orthomyxoviruses, phylogenetic evidence points to recent introduction of these viruses from birds to mammals. Following introduction, the natural mutation and evolution of the virus produced strains that now appear to be adapted to their new hosts. There are swine, equine, and human strains of type A influenza viruses that do not replicate well outside their respective host species. If birds are indeed responsible for us coming down with the flu today, we know of no reason why they might not have participated over the eons in the establishment of other purely mammalian diseases.

In free-living birds, the large number of apparently innocuous infections with Bunyaviridae, Togaviridae, and Flaviviridae suggest that birds may act as an ecological reservoir for maintenance of these virus populations. From a virocentric point of view (if there is such a thing), having a potentially highly mobile population of susceptible hosts on which transmission vectors may feed would be advantageous. It would provide a mechanism by which to transfer viruses over large geographical distances where they could then be transmitted by new related or unrelated vectors, thus increasing host range. Of course, one runs the risk here of assuming that the virus would be ecologically improved by extending its replicative capacity in new hosts. This may not be a valid assumption.

Until recently, the only other strains shown to cause disease in humans were of the H7 subtype. Conjunctivitis caused by purely avian H7 subtype viruses has been reported on two occasions (Kurtz et al., 1996; Webster et al., 1981a). The most disturbing set of events, however, was the more recent highly publicized influenza outbreak in Hong Kong. A purely avian H5 subtype virus was isolated from some 18 patients, 6 of whom died, from May through December of 1997. The index case, a 3-year-old child, in May followed a highly pathogenic outbreak of avian influenza that had just previously occurred in chickens in Hong Kong and its environs. The child had been exposed to ill birds at a day care center, and it was clear that the recovered virus was essentially the same as that recovered during the chicken outbreak. Considerable efforts were made to determine whether the virus was a contaminant and whether it was replicating in the child. The evidence strongly suggested that it was indeed replicating (Subbarao et al., 1998). Subsequent to this event, in November\u2013December the remaining confirmed cases were reported and an intense effort was mounted to determine exactly how this virus was transmitted. It is clear now that the H5N1 viruses infecting humans in Hong Kong 1997 were all of avian origin (Suarez et al., 1998). There is limited serologic suggestion of human-to-human transmission but no genetic evidence of adaptation to humans. This case was touted as a premier test run for the next predicted influenza pandemic. Whether this outbreak represents a simple dead-end zoonotic transmission or whether these purely avian influenza viruses can become fixed in the human population is a matter for conjecture. The avian H5 and H7 influenza strains have been the only natural influenza strains thus far to unequivocally cause systemic lethal infection in any species owing to the unique structure of their HA protein (see Fig. 3). A major fear is that by adding such HA subtypes to a population of mammalian viruses a whole new class of virulent strains might be created. Our experience in working with numerous highly pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains has been one of very little or no evidence for human infection in the 25 years that scientists and technicians have spent working with hundreds of different stains. But our experience has also been that, when one attempts to confine influenza viruses by setting biological rules for them, they usually find a way to break them.",

There is also serological evidence for avian retrovirus and avian coronavirus infections. In the case of Newcastle disease, the documented infections are mostly minor conjunctivitis.

In the case of Marek's disease, we see an example of virulence increasing in the face of continued vaccination against the virus (Fig. 1). Whether this is occurring as a result of the vaccination or a combination of factors, the fact is that the population of Marek's disease herpesviruses in nature is becoming more virulent. The vaccination programs for Newcastle disease utilize vaccines whose genetic compositions are becoming farther and farther removed from the virulent strains circulating in wild fowl (Fig. 2). This may not bode well for future control of virulent strains in commercial poultry.",

Again there are unknowns in this system, but the fact remains that we are seeing more virulence as the nonpathogenic AIV subtypes replicate in commercial poultry settings. Thus, this naive commercial population, unlike the waterfowl hosts to which the virus has adapted, appears to allow generation of heretofore unencountered virulence phenotypes. Similar scenarios appear to be playing out as more virulent infectious bronchitis strains and infectious bursal disease strains appear worldwide. One must be cautious, then, in working strictly under the previously mentioned virulence-decrease paradigms for mammalian viruses. These have been suggested mostly by the experiences with artificial introduction of rabbit papilloma viruses in Australia or where new introductions occur as human encroachment ensues (such as in the recent cases of Ebola virus or monkey poxvirus infections). In these cases, it was proposed that virus transmission results first in high virulence for the host followed by subsequent adaptation and attenuation.",

Additionally, other than use as molecular biological vectors, viruses in general have not been shown to provide anything positive to the ecology of any other organisms.

The data demonstrate that field isolates from chickens related to vaccine virus are isolated from poultry. The chicken/72 virus caused the last major outbreak of Newcastle disease in U.S. poultry and was epidemiologically linked to a pet bird. It is genetically related to a parrot isolate and viruses that caused disease in pigeons during the 1980s. Viruses isolated from cormorants in 1992 infected an unvaccinated turkey flock. These viruses appear to be circulating among cormorants, since closely related viruses were isolated again in 1997. No viruses related to the virulent chicken viruses from 1948 have been isolated since that time, indicating these virus types may no longer be circulating among birds. All the recent virulent Newcastle disease viruses were isolated from pet or exotic birds and chickens infected by free-living birds. These viruses are related to virulent viruses originally isolated during the 1930s.",
