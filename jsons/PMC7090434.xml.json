Cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Renmin hospital of Wuhan University from 30 January to 23 February 2020 were reviewed. After obtaining written informed consent, all clinical data were independently collected by two investigators. The diagnosis of COVID-19 followed the diagnostic criteria established by the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (sixth edition) issued by the National Health Commission of China. Nasal swab samples from high-risk pregnant women and their newborns were tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus using a kit (BioGerm, Shanghai, China) according to the World Health Organization guidelines for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (also recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing, China). Chest computed tomography (CT) scans of all infected pregnant women were performed and reviewed as part of their pre-partum assessment. These scans were reviewed for the usual characteristic signs of COVID-19, including peripheral and/or sub-pleural ground-glass opacities.",

Two recent studies have also shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus has not been detected in amniotic fluid, cord blood, or breast milk of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2.9 This may explain why all the neonates in this study were free from infection. Our result is also consistent with the observation that the incidence of disease and disease severity were lower in neonates than in adults during the SARS epidemic, which may be related to the difficulty of vertical transmission of coronavirus,10 proper handling at birth, and timely isolation of the neonate after birth. A recent study showed that in addition to the lung, SARS-CoV-2 targets other organs such as kidney and testicles.11 It cannot be ruled out that SARS-CoV-2 may have an impact on the placenta. Thus, to ensure the safety of the parturients and newborns, we chose to perform elective Cesarean delivery.",

Although both neuraxial and general anesthesia have been safely reported in pregnancy,12 because the lung is the main target organ of the virus, the choice of anesthetic regimens for Cesarean delivery is critical for pregnant women with COVID-19. Therefore, we recommend that neuraxial anesthesia wherever possible, based on it reducing the possibility of exacerbating pulmonary complications due to intubation. In our study, 14 of 17 pregnant women underwent epidural anesthesia, the onset time of sensory and motor block, the degree of motor block, the height of sensation, and the quality of anesthesia appeared to be the same as those of non-infected pregnant women. Nevertheless, it was noted that 86% of parturients undergoing epidural anesthesia experienced intraoperative hypotension. Importantly, because of the short duration and the hemodynamic changes, no adverse end-organ damage was apparent. As for why there appeared to be significant hypotension, a recent study suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can bind with the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor.13 The key of SARS-CoV-2 infection is its S protein binding with ACE2 receptor.14 These studies imply that the circulatory system is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. General anesthesia was used in three of our SARS-CoV-2-infected parturients. General anesthesia did not have any adverse effects on the neonatal outcomes and mothers\u2019 recovery from COVID-19.",

There is a possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment when exposed to high concentrations of aerosol for a long time. To solve the safety issues such as environmental pollution and infection of medical staff with COVID-19, all medical staff involved in the operation need to be identified. They should be trained in proper infection control management procedures and have a thorough understanding of nosocomial infection control and risk factors for COVID-19. In this series of patients, no medical staff involved in the operation were infected with COVID-19. Several factors may have influenced this positive result. First, a specific patient negative pressure transfer vehicle and a dedicated negative pressure operating room were used to prevent the spread of the virus, and sterilization was performed after surgery. Second, patients and medical staff followed the established biosafety procedures when entering and leaving the operating room. Dedicated personnel wore protective equipment and infection control in the negative pressure anterior chamber and buffer room to improve efficiency. Third, parturients wore a surgical mask in case they coughed during tracheal intubation, and suctioning reduced the spread of respiratory droplets and aerosols.",
