The SIR dynamics are expressed using It\u00f4-stochastic differential equations. We first derive the parameters of the model from the available daily data from European regions based on a 24-day history of infections, recoveries and deaths. The derived parameters have been aggregated to project future trends for the Indian subcontinent, which is currently at an early stage in the infection cycle. The projections are meant to serve as a guideline for strategizing the socio-political counter measures to mitigate COVID-19.",

There is an eminent danger and most of these population are under the poverty-line or the countries do not have huge resources for medical interventions for affected patients. The options are limited -either go for herd immunity which can backfire and it is too risky or lockdown and restrict the population from moving around. Thus we try to factor in the percentage of population allowed to move around (some are essential services and some not obeying the orders) and assuming the mobility factors appropriately 1 , we try to predict what can happen during the lockdown.
