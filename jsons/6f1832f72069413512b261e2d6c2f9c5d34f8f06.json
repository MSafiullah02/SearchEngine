The consensus is that patients were avoiding going to hospitals because they feared getting infected with COVID-19. This may highlight the over-use of EDs by non-emergency and low complex cases that could be managed by general practitioners; however, there may also be a worrisome tendency to postpone consultations with specialists, even when necessary.",

It emerges that the two curves almost mirror one another, with a meeting point on the 16th of March and the lowest peak of ED visits corresponding with the highest peak in the COVID-19 daily mortality trend. ED visits have recently shown a timid turnaround, reaching 150 visits/day on 16th April, which suggests the two curves will meet again in the coming next weeks.",
