The vast majority of these epitopes are derived from Betacoronavirues, and more specifically from SARS-CoV, which alone accounts for over 60% of them. In terms of the host in which the various B and T cell epitopes were recognized (Table 2\n), most epitopes (either B or T) were defined in humans or murine systems.

This is in agreement with a recent paper published on February 7, 2020 that shows the highest similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS or SARS-like CoVs (Wu et al., 2020). Further, SARS-Cov is the closest related virus to SARS-CoV-2 for which a significant number of epitopes have been defined in humans (and other species) and that also causes human disease with lethal outcomes. Accordingly, in the following analyses, we focused on comparing known SARS-CoV epitope sequences to the SARS-CoV-2 sequence.",

This hypothesis is in agreement with the recent cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, showing a high resemblance in the overall structure with the SARS-CoV spike protein (Wrapp et al., 2020). In the same study, however, the authors do not observe cross-recognition of SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies with the SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, they observed no reactivity with SARS-CoV antibodies that recognize the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 retains the same capability to bind the ACE2 receptor of SARS-CoV (Wrapp et al., 2020). This suggests that the B cell prediction performed on the RBD domain will require further studies.",
