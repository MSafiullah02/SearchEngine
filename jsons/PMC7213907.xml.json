There are no data specific to the aerosolization of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 specifically through placement of a tube thoracostomy, and the potential risk likely varies based on the indication for placement. This document provides guidance regarding special precautions to consider during the COVID-19 pandemic to minimize exposure risk to staff during tube insertion, drainage system management and tube removal. The information provided here is not intended to supersede clinical judgment. Given the limited data, the lack of any of the special equipment below should not prevent or delay the placement of a tube thoracostomy in a life-threatening situation. As the current pandemic evolves, some or all of the data and recommendations may not be applicable to future conditions.",

Accordingly, tube thoracostomy insertion for patients with known or suspected COVID-19 should occur by the most experienced provider and with the fewest number of staff members required. Optimally a thoracic procedure team would be created, composed of an attending surgeon and either a senior resident, fellow or advanced practice provider. If a thoracic procedure team is available, they would respond to all requests for tube thoracostomy in at-risk or confirmed COVID-positive patients throughout the hospital, thereby minimizing both variability in and number of proceduralists, as well as maximizing the likelihood of successful tube placement. If creation of a formal thoracic procedure team is not logistically possible, strong consideration should be given to limiting the number of both providers and specialists performing tube thoracostomy.",
