The likelihood of such transmission is increased when changes in the environment, either natural or imposed by humans, place different species in close proximity. An early example of this phenomenon comes from the family Herpesviridae in which infection of the natural reservoir host usually results in minimal clinical disease, whereas infection of other closely related species may result in an acutely lethal cytolytic or neoplastic process.",

Although isolation of primate species is the norm in well-managed modern facilities, such may not be the case with recently imported animals. Substandard separation of species, coupled with the stress of capture and movement, puts these animals at increased risk. Similarly, transmission of viral agents from nonprimate host to primate host may result in severe disease. Examples include transmission of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus from rodents to callitrichids and the transmission of various orthopoxviruses such as monkeypox or cowpox from rodent vectors to nonhuman primates. Increasingly zoological collections have adapted multiple species exhibits and more naturalist settings. While such exhibits have many benefits, it should be remembered that they may promote inadvertent cross-species transmission of infectious agents.",

At that time, both institutes were importing large numbers of macaque monkeys for use in polio vaccine production. In both outbreaks, cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were primarily affected, but at Merck a small number of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) also exhibited signs of the disease. Since then, there have been several additional outbreaks of monkeypox infection involving both New and Old World monkeys (Arita and Henderson, 1968, Arita and Henderson, 1976).",

While rodents, particularly African squirrels, are thought to serve as the major viral reservoir, African green monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops) have a high prevalence of antibodies to monkeypox virus with no evidence of clinical disease (Gispen et al., 1976, Khodakevich and Szczeniowski, 1987). It is likely that the macaques involved in the original outbreaks may have been incidentally exposed to infected African green monkeys during shipment from Asia. Monkeypox virus has a relatively broad natural host range that includes humans, anthropoid apes, and Old and New World monkeys. Primates in which monkeypox infections have been shown to occur include cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus), squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), African green monkeys, owl-faced monkeys (Cercopithecus hamlyni), rhesus monkeys, cynomolgus monkeys, hanuman langurs (Semnopithecus entellus), white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar), orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and human beings (Homo sapiens) (von Magnus et al., 1959, Peters, 1966, McConnell et al., 1968, Marennikova et al., 1976). In addition, a variety of rodent species, anteaters, pangolins, and birds from endemic areas of Africa have been shown to have antibodies to the virus.",

Viremia develops 3\u20134 days following experimental infection, at which time the virus disseminates to multiple sites, including skin, lung, mucous membranes, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract (Zaucha et al., 2001). Lesions within the skin initially appear as papules consisting of proliferative acanthocytes and progress to vesicles. Intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions are apparent within acanthocytes. Vesiculation is followed by umbilication to form the classic pock lesion. Progressive dermal changes take place over a 4- to 14-day period. Lesions within the lung are similar, consisting of irregular foci of hemorrhagic necrosis. These may be responsible for more serious clinical sequelae and transmission of the virus by the aerosolized route. Paralleling epidemiologic observations in humans, experimental infections in cynomolgus macaques have demonstrated that isolates from the Congo Basin clade are associated with increased lesion severity, elevated levels of virus, and greater mortality relative to isolates from the West African clade (Chen et al., 2005, Saijo et al., 2009).",

To satisfy requirements for drug and vaccine licensure, nonhuman primate models of variola infection have been described. In a study by Jahrling et al., intravenous administration of high-dose virus to cynomolgus macaques resulted in an acutely lethal infection resembling hemorrhagic smallpox in man (Jahrling et al., 2004). Symptoms included fever, anorexia, cough, and viral exanthema followed by development of a severe hemorrhagic diathesis, multisystem organ failure, and death within 6 days of inoculation. Clinicopathologic findings included leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, increased D-dimers, and elevated serum creatinine. Dermal lesions were characterized by erythema and hemorrhage with progression to typical vesiculopustlar lesions. Virus was disseminated systemically via a monocytic cell-associated viremia to lymphoid, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and renal tissues. Additional findings included significant cytokine elaboration and depletion of T-cell dependent regions of lymphoid tissue.",

The first report in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) may actually be a 1982 epizootic originally attributed to a Yatapoxvirus. Clinical disease was characterized by the appearance of erythematous papules progressing through vesiculation and umbilication over a 4- to 6-week course (Gough et al., 1982). Lesions were concentrated on the face, scrotum, and palmar or plantar surfaces. Identification of the etiologic agent was based on ultrastructural examination. A more recent report describes development of hemorrhagic dermal lesions with an identical distribution in a colony of marmosets and Saguinus species (Matz-Rensing et al., 2006). Viral etiology was determined using molecular techniques to be a poxvirus with close homology to cowpox. Skin lesions from both reports were characterized by acanthosis with epidermal necrosis, ulceration, and typical pox-like intracytoplasmic inclusions. Disease may be fatal in New World monkeys. Transmission occurs via contact with rodent vectors which have a geographic distribution over much of Europe, Asia, and Africa but are not present in North America.

The classification of herpesviruses has been recently updated by the International Committee of the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) resulting in a number of name changes (Davison et al., 2009). Names for the nonhuman primate herpesvirus species are based on the host genus with the name ending in \u2013ine (i.e. Macacine herpesvirus 1 replaces Cercopithicine herpesvirus 1). Current taxonomic designations with the former and common names are presented in Table 1.2. Although the viral subfamilies are distinctly different, as a group the herpesviruses do share certain genetic and biologic properties. These include (1) a complex double-stranded DNA genome encoding a number of enzymes involved in protein processing, DNA synthesis, and nucleic acid metabolism; (2) DNA synthesis and capsid formation in the nucleus; (3) requisite destruction of the host cell to complete the viral replicative process; and (4) viral persistence in a latent form within the host.",

Although rarely responsible for disease in the natural host, inadvertent infection of humans results in a disseminated viral infection characterized by ascending paralysis and a high case fatality rate. The increased incidence of human cases in the late 1980s and early 1990s combined with the 1997 death of a primate center research assistant has spurred continued interest in the prevention and treatment of this disease. Infection of non-macaque species, including the Patas monkey, black and white colobus (Colobus abyssinicus), DeBrazza\u2019s monkey (Cercopithecus neglectus), capuchin monkey (Cebus apella), and common marmoset, has reportedly produced fatal disease (Gay and Holden, 1933, Loomis et al., 1981, Wilson et al., 1990, Thompson et al., 2000). Persistent and asymptomatic B virus infection in a colony of capuchin monkeys housed near but not in direct contact with rhesus macaques has been reported and indicates that safe practices should be employed when working with all nonhuman primate species (Coulibaly et al., 2004).",

Homologs of all of these genes occur in related viruses of humans, such as Human herpesvirus 1 and 2 (HHV1 and HHV2; Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2), and of primates, such as Papiine herpesvirus 2 (Herpesvirus papio 2) and Cercopithecine herpesvirus 2 (Ohsawa et al., 2002a, Ohsawa et al., 2003, Perelygina et al., 2003b). Notably, herpes B virus lacks a homolog of the HHV neurovirulence gene \u03b3134.5 suggesting alternate strategies to promote replication of B virus within neurons (Perelygina et al., 2003b). The viral envelope contains at least nine glycoproteins that are targets of the immune response and help to define cellular tropism. Glycoproteins B and D have 80% and 56% identity with the respective HHV1 glycoproteins, while glycoproteins G and C demonstrate significant sequence variation (Ohsawa et al., 2002a, Perelygina et al., 2002). Genomic sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis have demonstrated that distinct genotypes of herpes B virus occur in different species of macaques including rhesus, cynomolgus, pig-tailed, lion-tailed, and Japanese macaques (Smith et al., 1998, Thompson et al., 2000, Ohsawa et al., 2002b). The parallel arrangement of phylogenic trees for B virus isolates and mitochondrial DNA sequences from the respective macaque species indicates probable co-speciation. Viral replication occurs rapidly, with enveloped capsids present 8\u201310 h after infection. In cell culture, syncytial cells and Cowdry-type A intranuclear inclusions are readily apparent.",

The percentage of animals with active oral lesions is much less and in one large study of 14 400 macaques was found to be 2.3% (Keeble, 1960). The virus is transmitted through sexual or biting behavior and by fomites. In overcrowded or unsanitary conditions, animals may become infected at an earlier age and the seropositive rate may be higher. Animals remain infected for life and may periodically shed the virus in oral and genital secretions. The greatest risk of primary infection occurs during the breeding season in sexually adolescent animals 2\u20133 years of age (Weigler et al., 1990, Weigler et al., 1993).",

Primary infection results in an initial round of replication at the site of inoculation. Histologically, this is characterized by the ballooning degeneration of keratinocytes with progression to vesiculation. Multinucleated, syncytial cells and eosinophilic to basophilic, intranuclear viral inclusions may be prominent. Immunohistochemistry utilizing antibodies against HHV1 can be used to demonstrate viral antigen in equivocal lesions. Inflammatory cells may be found within vesicles, epidermis, and subjacent dermis. Endothelial cell necrosis with intranuclear viral inclusions may be seen. In disseminated disease, there is widespread, hemorrhagic necrosis within the liver, lung, brain, adrenal gland, and lymphoid organs (Espana, 1973, Simon et al., 1993, Anderson et al., 1994, Carlson et al., 1997).

False-negative tests and latently infected immunologically unreactive individuals complicate the interpretation of results on single samples. Various strategies have been explored to increase the sensitivity and specificity of serodiagnosis and improve biosafety including assays based on recombinant glycoproteins and surrogate antigens such as HHV1, Papiine herpesvirus 2, and Cercopithicine herpesvirus 2 (Ohsawa et al., 1999, Takano et al., 2001, Yamamoto et al., 2005). The variable antigenic cross-reactivity of certain glycoprotein epitopes may also allow for discrimination of antibodies to closely related alphaherpesviruses (Perelygina et al., 2002, Perelygina et al., 2005, Fujima et al., 2008). A number of strategies for virus speciation via polymerase chain reaction technology have also been described (Hirano et al., 2002, Perelygina et al., 2003a, Oya et al., 2004, Miranda et al., 2005).

Centrifugal spread may contribute to the enlargement of lesions or generalization during primary infection. Factors contributing to recrudescence are poorly understood, but stress, fever, ultraviolet light, tissue or nerve damage, and immunosuppression have been identified clinically as contributing factors in the reactivation of HHV in humans and may play a similar role with B virus in macaques. It is generally thought that stress related to changing social dynamics, transportation, or relocation can result in reactivation of herpes B virus (Mitsunaga et al., 2007, Elmore and Eberle, 2008). Detection of shedding, although uncommon, appears to be most strongly associated with the breeding season (Weigler et al., 1993, Huff et al., 2003). Other studies have shown that viral shedding in seropositive macaques was not commonly associated with common laboratory procedures or occurrences such as quarantine, parturition, and chair restraint (Weir et al., 1993, Huff et al., 2003). Reactivation of oral lesions has been described in macaques treated with immunosuppressive agents and with solid organ transplantation drug regimens (Chellman et al., 1992). Interestingly, reactivation is not commonly recognized in macaques experimentally inoculated with SIV and dying with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Simon et al., 1993) (Figure 1.2\n).",

Animals are initially screened by titration ELISA and western blot. Negative animals should be kept in single cage housing or in small groups and be periodically tested by a modified ELISA for at least one year. Animals that are repeatedly negative by these criteria can then be moved to larger groups. Once in these breeding groups, animals should be periodically tested for seroconversion. Repeated testing during the quarantine period is required because animals may be (1) chronically infected and immunologically unreactive or (2) in the early stages of disease prior to seroconversion. Serologic testing on an annual or semi-annual basis should be continued as a component of colony management as seropositive macaques have been detected as late as 7 years post establishment of a SPF program (Hilliard and Ward, 1999). Because the positive predictive value of screening tests decreases concomitantly with the reduced prevalence of disease, false-positive test results are more likely during the maintenance phase and require pursuit of confirmatory testing. While antibody testing is useful for colony management, the value of a single test in an individual animal is limited.",

Gross lesions include vesicular eruptions in the oral cavity or on genitalia. Vesicles or pustules coalesce, ulcerate, and resolve within 2 weeks of appearance (Rogers et al., 2005). Lesions may occasionally spread to adjacent skin. Genital lesions are occasionally severe, involving the vulvar, penile, or perineal tissues. Secondary bacterial infections and fibrosis may contribute to vaginal or urethral obstruction (Singleton et al., 1995, Martino et al., 1998). Disseminated disease has not been described in adult baboons and inoculation of juveniles with neurovirulent strains does not result in clinical disease (Rogers et al., 2005). Severe disease is possible in infant baboons. Experimental inoculation of infantile baboons (though described as an SA8 inoculation, the original inoculum was isolated from an infant baboon) produced a fibrinonecrotic pulmonary alveolitis that was accompanied by multifocal hepatic necrosis. Intranuclear inclusions were noted (Eichberg et al., 1976). A similar case of severe necrotizing pneumonia secondary to natural transmission of HVP2 from a dam to an infant baboon was recently described by Wolf and colleagues (Wolf et al., 2006b).",

Inadvertent infection of gibbons, gorillas, tree shrews (Tupaia glis), orangutans, and chimpanzees has been described (Smith et al., 1969, Emmons and Lennette, 1970, McClure et al., 1972, Marennikova et al., 1973, McClure et al., 1980, Kik et al., 2005). In these species, infection usually results in mild, self-limiting oral vesicular lesions. Conversely, infection of New World species, including owl monkeys, callitrichids, and one report in a group of white-faced saki monkeys (Pithecia pithecia pithecia), results in a lethal disseminated disease similar to that caused by SaHV1 from which it must be distinguished (Hunt and Melendez, 1966, Melendez et al., 1969, Huemer et al., 2002, Matz-Rensing et al., 2003, Schrenzel et al., 2003, Lefaux et al., 2004). Disseminated disease is also reported secondary to experimental intravaginal inoculation of tamarins (Saguinus oedipus and S. fuscicollis) with HHV2 (Felsburg et al., 1973). Experimental inoculation of capuchin monkeys produced localized disease (Nahmias et al., 1971, Felsburg et al., 1972).",

The epizootiology and origin of these early outbreaks is poorly understood. In several instances they occurred in recently imported animals. Serologic evidence suggests that the Medical Lake macaque virus originated in Malaysia. Transmission from an unidentified reservoir host to aberrant primate hosts may be one factor related to the establishment of epizootics. The natural host of SVV has not been identified. Because disease is less severe in Asian macaque species and neutralizing antibodies have been detected in asymptomatic stump-tailed macaques, it is possible that macaque species may play a role in transmitting the virus to more susceptible species. Reactivation from a latent carrier state also plays an important role in transmission of the virus (Soike et al., 1984, Mahalingam et al., 1992). Recent cases of SVV in animals undergoing total body irradiation or other forms of experimental immunosuppression are thought to be associated with recrudescence in clinically affected animals or their contacts (Kolappaswamy et al., 2007, Schoeb et al., 2008, Hukkanen et al., 2009). Reactivation may also occur secondary to stress of shipment or movement within a facility. Once established within a colony, the virus may spread rapidly via the respiratory route. Transmission via direct contact with skin lesions is also possible.",

A vesicular dermatitis appears by day 10 post-inoculation and is often hemorrhagic in appearance. Lesions progress from papule to vesicle to crust and appear as successive crops such that lesions of all stages may be present. Cutaneous lesions are characterized histologically by the formation of multiple vesicles within the epidermis that contain cell debris, erythrocytes, and rarely syncytial cells. Hyperplasia of the basal cell layer is associated with these vesicles. Characteristic eosinophilic, Cowdry-type A, intranuclear inclusions may be found in cells adjacent to the vesicle. A necrotizing vasculitis often exists within the subjacent dermis with viral inclusions evident in endothelial and adjacent cells.",

They are slowly cytolytic and tend to cause enlargement of the nucleus and cytoplasm (cytomegaly) of infected cells both in vivo and in vitro. During viral replication, enveloped virions accumulate in large cytoplasmic vacuoles instead of being readily released into intercellular spaces. This feature accounts for their relative cell-associated nature and explains the fact that cytoplasmic inclusion bodies can also be found in infected cells. Unlike many of the cytolytic herpesviruses, cytomegaloviruses also tend to be restricted in terms of their host range with each viral species thought to have coevolved with its host. Finally, latent infections tend to persist in glandular tissue, lymphoreticular cells, and kidneys rather than in neurons.",

Macaques become infected within the first year of life (Vogel et al., 1994). Prior immunity also does not prevent re-infection, and animals can be infected with multiple genetic variants. For instance, rhesus macaques naturally infected with RhCMV are susceptible to infection by an antigenically distinct African green monkey CMV and commonly become infected with both strains during captivity (Swack and Hsiung, 1982).",

In humans, infection with EBV is usually asymptomatic but may cause infectious mononucleosis when primary infections occur after puberty. This illness is characterized by lymphadenopathy, fever, pharyngitis, and circulating atypical lymphocytes in adolescents and young adults. EBV has been associated with Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, hemophagocytic syndrome, T cell lymphomas, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma in immunocompetent persons and oral hairy leukoplakia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders in immunocompromised patients.",

The disease course and pathologic characteristics parallel those observed in HIV-infected persons in whom the development of NHL represents an AIDS-defining illness. SIV-infected rhesus macaques have an incidence of NHL ranging from 4\u201319% while SIV-infected cynomologus macaques have an incidence of up to 40% (Rezikyan et al., 1995, Habis et al., 1999, Matz-Rensing et al., 1999). Lymphocryptovirus transcripts are frequently detected in tumor cells while SIV transcripts or proteins are not. These neoplasms usually develop in extranodal locations including the nasal cavity, periorbital tissues, gastrointestinal tract, urogenital tract, myocardium, and central nervous system and are classified as centroblastic, immunoblastic, large cell, or Burkitt-like lymphomas (Baskin et al., 2001). Tumors are comprised of clonal expansions of CD-20-positive B cells and express a full spectrum of latent gene products (Blaschke et al., 2001). While NHL typically develops in conjunction with progression to AIDS/SAIDS, T cell depletion is not sufficient for pathogenesis (Rivailler et al., 2004). The ability of lymphocryptoviruses to immortalize B cells may allow for increased risk of mutation and subsequent lymphomagenesis. Variable expression of the oncogenes p53, p21, cMyc, and bcl2 in neoplastic tissue has been described (Kahnt et al., 2002). There is one report of a mycosis fungoides-like cutaneous T cell lymphoma consisting of CD3\u2013/CD8+ lymphocyte and characteristic Pautier microabcesses in a pig-tailed macaque. The lymphocryptovirus isolated from tumor material was designated as Macaca nemistrina herpesvirus (MneLCV1) and appears to have a unique T cell tropism (Rivadeneira et al., 1999).",

Marmosets demonstrated weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea, and palpable enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes. Histologically, the masses were comprised of sheets of CD20+ neoplastic round cells effacing lymph node architecture and infiltrating the large and small intestine, liver, kidney, and lung. CalHV3 was detected in tumor material and circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells using molecular techniques. The virus was subsequently isolated (Cho et al., 2001).

The absence of these genes may contribute to inefficient viral transmission and the lower seroprevalence of CalHV3 observed in marmoset colonies. These genetic differences suggest that CalHV3 may be more closely related to a primitive lymphocryptovirus from which it, EBV, and the other the Old World lymphocryptoviruses evolved (Rivailler et al., 2002a, Fogg et al., 2005, Lacoste et al., 2010). Lymphocryptoviruses have since been detected in various New World primate species including the squirrel monkey, white-faced saki, white-fronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons), black spider monkey (Ateles paniscus), golden handed tamarin (Saguinus midas), and black-pencilled marmoset (C. pencillata) (Cho et al., 2001, de Thoisy et al., 2003b, Ehlers et al., 2003).",

In addition to the natural model of RhLCV infection in macaques, a number of induced models have been described in the literature. Rhesus macaques seronegative to RhLCV are susceptible to experimental inoculation with EBV and develop a resolving atypical lymphcytosis and lymphadenopathy. Cotton-top tamarins are susceptible to experimental infection with human EBV and develop malignant B-cell lymphomas (Shope et al., 1973, Miller et al., 1977, Niedobitek et al., 1994). Common marmosets develop an antibody response and persistent infection but do not consistently develop lymphoma (Emini et al., 1986). Macaques coinfected with SIV and EBV have been proposed as a model of AIDS-associated Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma (Feichtinger et al., 1992).",

Species in this genus are closely related to Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV, human herpesvirus 8). Rhadinoviruses are thought to be species specific and have been reported in rhesus and other macaque species as well as in African green monkeys, baboons, mandrills, drills, gibbons, chimpanzees, and gorillas (Greensill et al., 2000a, Greensill et al., 2000b, Lacoste et al., 2000a, Lacoste et al., 2000b, Lacoste et al., 2001, Whitby et al., 2003, Duprez et al., 2004, Bruce et al., 2005). Rhadinoviruses are also well characterized in spider monkeys and squirrel monkeys. The ICTV-recognized Rhadinovirus species are presented in Table 1.2, and additional identified species are cataloged elsewhere (Lacoste et al., 2010). Members of this genus are classified into two distinct lineages; the Rhadinovirus-1 lineage containing KSHV and the primate Retroperitoneal Fibromatosis Herpesvirus (RFHV) and the Rhadinovirus-2 lineage which includes rhesus Rhadinovirus (RRV) (Desrosiers et al., 1997, Rose et al., 1997, Schultz et al., 2000).

Closely related viruses have been recognized in cynomolgus (CRV) and pig-tailed (PRV) macaques. The RRV genome is 130 kb in length and encodes 84 open reading frames (Alexander et al., 2000, Searles et al., 1999). The genome is collinear with the KSHV genome and most KSHV open reading frames have representative homologs in the RRV genome, and vice versa (Lacoste et al., 2010). Rhadinoviruses, including RRV, encode several homologs of cellular cytokines including a viral IL-6 that has proinflammatory activity and may contribute to pathogenesis (Kaleeba et al., 1999). The ORF73 gene encodes the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) which is essential for maintaining the viral DNA episome tethered to mitotic host cell chromosomes, allowing the virus to cosegregate with daughter cells during cell division (Wen et al., 2009). This protein is also thought to suppress lytic viral replication (DeWire and Damania, 2005).",

Seroconversion can readily be detected by ELISA, and PCR can be performed on blood and tissue specimens. These viruses demonstrate two phases of infection; a latent or non-productive phase and a lytic or productive phase. RRV demonstrates a tropism for CD20+ B-lymphocytes with these cells likely serving as the primary site of RRV latency (Bergquam et al., 1999). While animals may cycle between both phases of infection, natural infections are generally asymptomatic. The factors associated with a change from latent infection to reactivation remain unclear.",

            "text": "Retroperitoneal fibromatosis is a multinodular to coalescent infiltrative process originating from the ileocecal junction and involving the root of the mesentery, mesenteric lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal tract. Prior to the identification of RFHV, RF was most frequently associated with Simian Retrovirus 2 (SRV2). While the detection of RFHV sequences is most often observed in SRV2 co-infected macaques, there are limited reports of SRV-negative/SIV-positive RFHV-associated mesenchymoproliferative lesions (Bielefeldt-Ohmann et al., 2005, Bruce et al., 2006). The RF lesion rarely infiltrates parenchymal organs but may produce small nodules or plaques disseminated across mesothelial surfaces. In severe cases, the entire gastrointestinal tract may be encased in a large fibrotic mass. Sclerotic and proliferative patterns of fibromatosis have been recognized and may coexist within the same animal. Histologically, the proliferative lesion is composed of spindle-shaped cells arranged in intersecting fascicles that infiltrate along serosal surfaces and surround normal structures. IHC using a cross-reactive anti-HHV8 LANA antibody demonstrates immunoreactivity within nuclei and large numbers of RFHV-infected cells in RF tissue (Bruce et al., 2006, Burnside et al., 2006). A variable lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory reaction is usually present. The tissue is highly vascular and cells are embedded within a stromal network composed of collagen and reticulin. Absence of nuclear anaplasia and mitotic figures distinguish the lesion from fibrosarcoma. These cells are vimentin, desmin, and smooth muscle \u03b1-actin-positive and reveal variable positivity for the factor VIII-related antigen (Tsai et al., 1995). An origin from vascular smooth muscle (pericyte) is favored. RF lesions have not been recognized in all large macaque colonies suggesting that RFHV is required but not sufficient for RF pathogenesis and that additional cofactors are required. Recognition of RF cases has declined in recent years and may be associated with elimination of SRV2 from SPF colonies (Figure 1.10\n).",

Its oncogenicity in other species has not been fully explored. HVS will infect and transform human T lymphocytes in vitro. These T cells have a mature, activated phenotype and maintain the antigen-specific reactivity of the parental cell. The transformed cells have cytotoxic capabilities and can continue to provide B cell help. Due to these capabilities, HVS transformed T cell lines have been investigated as a potential means to confer adoptive T-cell-mediated immunotherapy targeting diseases such as HIV/AIDS (Meinl et al., 1997, Kumar et al., 1999). The ability of HVS to persist as a high copy number episome and provide sustained gene expression has also prompted study of the virus as a potential gene vector (Griffiths et al., 2006).",

Greater than 50 serotypes of adenoviruses have been isolated from nonhuman primate species, including macaques, African green monkeys, baboons, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, squirrel monkeys, owl monkeys, and cotton-topped tamarins (Bullock, 1965, Kim et al., 1967, Eugster et al., 1969, Shroyer et al., 1979, Davis et al., 1992, Roy et al., 2009). Although adenoviruses have been confirmed as causing a mild to moderately severe respiratory or enteric disease of monkeys and apes, many isolates have been obtained from oral or anal swabs or from cell cultures derived from clinically healthy animals, suggesting that subclinical and possibly persistent infections of these species are common. A more severe disease has been described in animals whose immune systems are compromised either by immunosuppressive drugs or by concomitant infections, such as SIV and Betaretrovirus infections.",

At the vertices of the icosahedron there are 12 capsomeres that are pentagonal in cross-section (pentons) and have filamentous glycoprotein projections with knobbly ends that protrude from their surfaces. The remaining 240 capsomeres are hexagonal in cross-section and are referred to as hexons. The adenovirus genome consists of a single linear molecule of double-stranded DNA that ranges from 26\u201345 kbp in length. Human adenoviruses are classified into six established species, A\u2013F, and a recently identified seventh species, G (Jones et al., 2007). While genetic data on nonhuman primate adenoviruses are forthcoming, current evidence suggests that ape viruses group with human species B and E while those isolated from Old World monkeys group with human species A and F (Kidd et al., 1995, Kovacs et al., 2004, Roy et al., 2004). Included in the early region of the genome designated E1 are two genes, E1A and E1B, that encode proteins capable of transforming cells in vitro and causing neoplasms in hamsters and rats in vivo. These proteins have been shown to bind to and presumably inactivate the two well-known tumor suppressor genes, p53 and Rb, thereby causing malignant transformation. Despite the well-recognized ability of certain adenoviruses to experimentally transform cells in vitro and in vivo, these same agents have not been incriminated as the cause of naturally occurring neoplasia in any species.",

In general, adenoviruses tend to be rather species specific, but, in some cases, closely related species may be infected. Initial infections are generally transmitted through aerosols generated by sneezing and coughing or through pharyngeal secretions of infected individuals. The fecal\u2013oral route is also a significant route of transmission due to the persistence of infection in tonsilar tissue and intestinal epithelium long after the clinical illness has subsided. Healthy apes and macaques shed large amounts of virus in the stool with virus detected in 36\u201390% of nonhuman primates maintained in captivity depending on the species and facility type (Roy et al., 2009). Housing individuals under crowded conditions clearly promotes the spread of infection. Children and neonatal nonhuman primates are more susceptible to clinically apparent adenovirus infections than adults. The severity of infection varies widely depending on the serotype of the virus, the age and immune status of the patient, and the host species. As mentioned previously, many such infections remain clinically inapparent even though the patient is shedding large amounts of virus.",

In endosomes, the filament-bearing penton capsomeres are stripped from the particle, the pH within the endosome drops, and the endosome ruptures, spilling the partially degraded virion into the cytoplasm. These free particles bind to microtubules and are transported to the nuclear pores where the viral DNA is discharged into the nucleus, leaving the capsid in the cytoplasm. During the course of viral replication, cellular DNA and protein synthesis is severely disrupted, as is the normal processing of host messenger RNAs. These processes are incompatible with cell survival. Nuclei of cells containing actively replicating adenovirus develop large, amphophilic to basophilic inclusion bodies that either completely fill the nucleus or are surrounded by a prominent halo.

            "text": "Simian virus 40 is classified in the polyomavirus genus of the family Polyomaviridae. Its genome consists of double-stranded circular DNA approximately 5000 bp in length, encompassing early- and late-coding regions and a noncoding regulatory region. Two DNA-binding proteins coded within the early region are referred to as the large and small T (tumor) antigens and bind to viral regulatory sequences to facilitate the transcription of late viral genes. These genes have been studied extensively and are used in the construction of transgenic animals due to their transcriptional promoting activity. Evidence from macaques suggests that distinct subtypes of SV40 may exist that differ in their genomic sequence and ability to induce disease. Based on the genetic analysis of the SV40 regulatory region, a protoarchetypal strain of SV40 has been identified in neotropical Goeldi\u2019s monkeys (Callimico goeldii) suggesting that the host range of viral genotypes may be more extensive than previously recognized (Zdziarski et al., 2004).",

While common in captive colonies, surveys of wild or feral populations indicate markedly different infection rates. For example examination of Mauritian cynomolgus macaques reveals low seroprevalence rates (8.8%), while serosurveys of rhesus macaques in Nepal reveals that more than 90% of the animals are positive as adults (Jones-Engel et al., 2006, Verschoor et al., 2008b). The principal mode of transmission has not been investigated but the identification of infected renal epithelial cells in immunologically normal animals suggests that urinary excretion may play a role. Pathology results from reactivation of latent infection or primary infection during periods of immunosuppression. Concurrent natural or experimental infection with SIV has been demonstrated in multiple cases (Horvath et al., 1992).",

These findings are accompanied by a chronic nonsuppurative tubulointerstitial nephritis, fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis, and atrophy. It is postulated that renal lesions may predominate in macaques acquiring infection during immunosuppression, whereas CNS lesions are more likely to occur following a recrudescence of latent infection (Horvath et al., 1992).

Viral DNA in these carcinomas and in viral-induced dysplastic lesions is present in an integrated form. If integration disrupts the E2 open reading frame, the normal control of early viral genes (E6/E7 products) is disrupted. These gene products can promote unregulated cell growth by two mechanisms: E7 protein binds to and deactivates the tumor suppressor protein (pRb) and E6 protein facilitates the degradation of another tumor-suppressing protein (p53). HPV types associated with cervical carcinoma apparently contain early viral proteins with high affinity for pRb and p53, whereas HPV types associated with low cancer risk are not. Other genetic and environmental factors likely act in conjunction with HPV infection to complete carcinogenesis. Papillomavirus DNA with similarities to HPV 16 was detected in a penile squamous cell carcinoma with lymph node metastasis in a rhesus macaque (Kloster et al., 1988, Ostrow et al., 1991). Female macaques that had mated with this male or were exposed via intermediate sexual contacts demonstrated a 71% incidence of papillomavirus infection that was detected clinically, histologically, or via molecular methods (Ostrow et al., 1990). Of the females surveyed, one presented with an adenosquamous carcinoma of the endocervix and another with a squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. These initial reports indicated that genital infection with this genus of viruses may be carcinogenic for nonhuman primates, as is the case in humans. Subsequent surveys by Wood and colleagues demonstrated up to a 19% overall prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in cynomolgus macaques (Wood et al., 2004, Wood et al., 2007). Lesions were highly associated with presence of papillomavirus infection and included benign vaginal papillomas, mild to severe intraepithelial dysplasia, and occasional invasive cervical carcinomas. Key morphologic features included koilocytosis, nuclear atypia, anisokaryosis, expansion of the basal epithelium, and presence of epithelial pearls. Transfer of exfoliated cervicovaginal cells propagated infection and initiated lesion development in a subset of animals (Wood et al., 2007).\n",

In regions of the world where rabies is endemic, populations of wild nonhuman primates may represent important vectors in the transmission of the virus to domestic species and humans. A report from the state of Cear\u00e1, Brazil attributed at least eight cases of human rabies deaths to transmission by rabid common marmosets (Favoretto et al., 2001). Viral isolates did not correspond to previously identified variants of rabies virus and were suggested to represent a unique strain. The tendency in this region to capture and raise marmosets as pets as well as the close proximity of marmoset habitats to urban centers are factors thought to contribute to the emergence of this cycle.",

The disease was seen in laboratory workers preparing cell lines derived from African green monkey tissue. Twenty-five primary cases with seven deaths were recorded. In addition, the agent spread to an additional six contacts. Reportedly the shipment of African green monkeys from which tissue had been obtained was normal and the source of infection in these animals remains unknown. An interesting account of the management practices concerning the procurement of these animals has been given and suggests that animals were infected in Uganda prior to shipment (Smith, 1982). The first filovirus, Marburg virus, was isolated and characterized from this outbreak. Since that time, isolated and small clusters of cases caused by an antigenically identical virus were identified in Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Uganda. In 2005 a more extensive outbreak occurred in Angola with over 200 infection-associated fatalities (WHO, 2005).",

As with the Marburg virus, secondary and tertiary cases occurred in contacts. In these contact cases, lower mortality suggested attenuation of the virus. A distinct viral strain, Ebola C\u00f4te-d\u2019Ivoire, was isolated from a 34-year-old female patient with a dengue-like syndrome after she necropsied a chimpanzee (Guenno et al., 1995).

Since 1995 smaller outbreaks have also occurred in Central and Western Africa. The most recent outbreak in 2007 in Uganda was associated with an Ebola virus distantly related to Ebola C\u00f4te-d\u2019Ivoire that was tentatively designated Ebola Bundibugyo (Towner et al., 2008).",

One species of Marburg virus is recognized (Lake Victoria) although this species is comprised of at least nine genetically distinct strains with up to 21% divergence at the nucleotide level (Bausch et al., 2006, Towner et al., 2006). These viruses have a single-stranded antisense RNA genome 12.7 kb in size. Morphologically, the virus forms distinctive filamentous, sometimes branching, structures 800\u20131000 nm in length and 80 nm in diameter. This structure is surrounded by a closely adherent host membrane in which 10-nm peplomers are found. The virus replicates by budding, and nucleocapsids accumulate in the cytoplasm, forming closely packed arrays of bundled filaments that are visible microscopically as viral inclusions (Murphy et al., 1971b).",

This infection causes a fatal hemorrhagic fever of macaques, but is carried asymptomatically by a number of African primates, principally the Patas monkey. This suggests that while macaques involved in the Reston outbreak were obtained from the Philippines, they may have become infected by inadvertent contact with African species. Inappropriate husbandry procedures such as reuse of needles and failure to organize flow of work may have contributed to the spread of virus within the Philippine facility (Miranda et al., 2002). Recently, Reston Ebolavirus has been isolated in the Philippines from pigs in association with a severe outbreak of porcine reproductive and respiratory disease syndrome (Barrette et al., 2009).

These mediators additionally may cause endothelial cell activation and breakdown of endothelial integrity contributing to hypovolemic shock. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in microvascular thrombosis and secondary multi-organ failure. Tissue factor release from infected monocytes is thought to be a key mediator in the induction of DIC in Ebola virus infections (Geisbert et al., 2003).

Multifocal necrosis is similarly present within the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland. In both locations, large amphophilic to eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions may be evident. Immunohistochemical staining for viral antigen identifies presence of virus within hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, monocytes/macrophages, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. Hepatocellular necrosis and necrosis within the adrenal cortex serve to distinguish filovirus infection from SHFV infection. An additional finding described in both Marburg and Ebola Reston viruses is the presence of a mild interstitial pneumonia accompanied by more diffuse evidence of disseminated microvascular thrombosis.\n",

Two protein subunits within the viral envelope (hemagglutinin (H) antigen and neurominidase (N) antigen) define viral subtypes.

Here we will address the members of the Respirovirus and Rubulavirus genera. The term parainfluenza virus will be used broadly to refer to viruses within these genera. Parainfluenza viruses have a global distribution where they are highly contagious and responsible for upper and lower respiratory ailments of a wide variety of species. Serological surveys indicate that most species of monkeys and apes have been infected with one or more parainfluenza viruses either in their natural habitats, as in the case of newly imported animals, or after being maintained in laboratory colonies. Many of these infections are mild and may go clinically undetected. The principal mode of transmission is by aerosols, although direct contact with infected secretions can also be a mode of transmission. Parainfluenza viruses appear to be less species specific than adenoviruses, as cross-species transmission among nonhuman primates, human beings, rodents, and possibly even dogs and cattle seems likely based on the antigenic relatedness of homologous serotypes isolated from these species. Reinfections with the same or related viruses occur with some frequency.",

            "text": "Once in the respiratory tract, parainfluenza viruses bind to epithelial cells of the respiratory mucosa in the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, trachea, or bronchi and bronchioles. The virus enters susceptible cells by binding to and fusing with the cell membranes. Its negative-strand RNA is transcribed to form multiple molecules of messenger RNA that code for various viral proteins and as an entire transcript of positive-strand RNA that serves as the template for the synthesis of entire molecules of negative-strand viral progeny RNA. During the replicative process, infected cells develop both intranuclear and intracytoplasmic, eosinophilic viral inclusion bodies corresponding to the naked, intranuclear, tubular nucleocapsid and the fuzzy coated cytoplasmic nucleocapsids, respectively. Infected cells, bearing viral-encoded fusion proteins, often fuse with adjacent noninfected cells to form multinucleated syncytial giant cells. Thus, the hallmark of infection by viruses of the family Paramyxoviridae is the presence of single or multinucleated syncytial cells bearing both intranuclear and intracytoplasmic, eosinophilic inclusion bodies. Infected cells undergo virus-induced lysis and desquamate from the mucosa, thereby predisposing the host to secondary bacterial infection. Coinfecting bacterial species include Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Pasteurella multocida (Sutherland et al., 1986, Kondgen et al., 2008, Szentiks et al., 2009). The disease produced by parainfluenza viruses varies from a mild upper respiratory infection (coryza) to a rhinotracheobronchitis or croup-like illness to frank pneumonia. Most animals recover from these infections unless secondary bacterial infection results in death. Most respirovirus and pneumovirus infections do not result in a viremia.",

Intranuclear inclusions composed of viral nucleocapsid are prominent and result from defective viral replication. One or more defects in the M, H, or F antigens prevent the formation of mature virons. Although an acute measles encephalitis in macaques and other species is well recognized (Baringer and Griffith, 1970), it is less clear whether reported cases of SSPE in nonhuman primates critically fulfill all diagnostic requirements of SSPE in humans (Kim et al., 1970, Albrecht et al., 1972).",

Necrosis of germinal centers in other lymphoid tissues is prominent. Complete cortical thymic necrosis with sparing of the medulla is reportedly unique to SHFV infection (Zack, 1993). Lesions elsewhere are compatible with those associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and include deposition of fibrin thrombi within glomeruli, hepatic sinusoids, and lung. Lesions within the small intestine consist of extensive hemorrhage within the lamina propria accompanied by intestinal epithelial cell necrosis. As with other arteriviruses, fetal loss is common. A lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalitis is present in a minority of animals. Macrophages represent the principal target cell of SHFV infection, and the unique sensitivity of macaques to this viral infection relates to the propensity of their macrophages to support viral growth (Gravell et al., 1980a).",

HCV is a member of the tentative genus Hepacivirus. Like other members of the flaviridae, HCV is a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus. It was identified in 1989 through work largely made possible through transmission of infectious serum from human patients with non-A non-B hepatitis to chimpanzees (Choo et al., 1989). Like many other RNA viruses, HCV has an error-prone replicase resulting in a high mutation rate that leads to the production of progeny virions exhibiting extensive sequence variation.

Structural proteins are encoded within the N-terminus of the polyprotein and the homologous nonstructural proteins encoded within the C-terminus. GBV-A and -C are unique among the flaviviridae in that they lack a well-defined capsid protein. As with all flaviridae translation of the viral proteins is mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), a highly structured RNA sequence within the 5\u2019 NTR. The IRES binds to the host 40S ribosomal subunit and the eukaryotic initiation factor to precisely position the start codon at the ribosome decoding site. One of the critical elements of the IRES is the IIIc stem loop which is highly conserved not only among HCV genotypes but GBV-B and pestiviruses. Deletion of the IIIc loop results in a significant reduction of IRES-initiated translation and thus has been an attractive target for small molecule inhibitors. The structure and function of the IIIc stem loop have been compared between HCV and GBV-B and have revealed extensive homology suggesting that GBV-B may represent an appropriate model to study such inhibitors.",

Experimental inoculation of rhesus and cynomolgus macaques results in disease that recapitulates that observed in humans (Callis et al., 1982, Baize et al., 2009). Clinical symptoms include fever, anorexia, and an acute respiratory syndrome. On histopathologic examination an interstitial pneumonia and alveolitis may be identified as well as a multifocal, necrotizing hepatitis with minimal to moderate periportal, mononuclear infiltrates. Dendritic cells, macrophages, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells are the cellular targets of infection. Earlier and more robust humoral and cellular immune responses are associated with control of viral replication and survival in the cynomolgus model (Baize et al., 2009). Severe, fatal disease associated with experimental Lassa virus infection in common marmosets has also been described (Carrion et al., 2007). Animals developed fever and weight loss accompanied by high levels of viral replication. At necropsy, the characteristic multifocal hepatic necrosis was present in addition to evidence of hepatocyte proliferation as indicated by KI67 immunostaining. Animals demonstrated lymphoid depletion characterized by loss of T and B cells. Depleted regions were replaced with histiocytic infiltration. Such changes were likely associated with impairment of the adaptive immune response and progression of disease.",

At the time these epizootics were suspected to be the result of an underlying simian viral infection. The issue remained unresolved until the early 1980s when, spurred by a burgeoning epidemic of immunodeficiency in homosexual men, investigators simultaneously identified two agents capable of inducing immunosuppressive disease in macaques. The first virus, a member of the Betaretrovirus genus, was identified and designated simian retrovirus type D (SRV/D) (since designated simian retrovirus [SRV]) (Daniel et al., 1984, Gravell et al., 1984, Marx et al., 1984). The second, a member of the Lentivirus genus, was designated simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac) (Daniel et al., 1985, Letvin et al., 1985). This primate lentivirus is closely related to the etiologic agent of human AIDS and has subsequently been the subject of intensive investigation as an animal model of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Because SRV is more distantly related to the human immunodeficiency viruses than SIV, it has received far less attention than its lentivirus cousin. Although SIV may be of greater scientific interest as an animal model of human AIDS, SRV is clearly of greater significance in the management and care of captive macaques. As experience has shown, not only is SRV more difficult to eliminate from macaque colonies, it is also responsible for most cases of spontaneous viral-induced immunodeficiency in captive members of these species.",

            "text": "Simian Betaretroviruses (formerly Type D retroviruses) exist as both endogenous and exogenous forms (Table 1.6\n). Endogenous virus sequences have been recognized in squirrel monkeys, spectacled langurs, members of the Cercopithecinae, and are suspected in several species of colobines (Heberling et al., 1977, Todaro et al., 1978, van der Kuyl et al., 1997). SRV was originally isolated in 1970 from the mammary neoplasm of a female rhesus macaque and was designated the Mason\u2013Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) (Chopra and Mason, 1970). Subsequent work indicated that this virus caused a wasting syndrome and thymic atrophy when inoculated into infant rhesus macaques and that approximately 25% of all macaques housed at US regional primate research centers were seroreactive to MPMV or a closely related virus (Fine et al., 1975, Fine and Arthur, 1981). Several SRV serotypes have since been reported and include SRV type 1 (SRV-1), type 2 (SRV-2), type 4 (SRV-4), and type 5 (SRV-5). More recently SRV-Tsukuba (SRV-T) was isolated from macaques housed at the Tsukuba Primate Center in Japan while SRV-6 and SRV-7 were identified in free-ranging rhesus macaques and langurs (Semnopithecus entellus) from India (Nandi et al., 2000, Nandi et al., 2006, Hara et al., 2005). These three novel viruses remain untyped by antibody neutralization assays. Significant genetic variation exists among the serotypes. The prototypic retrovirus, MPMV (SRV-3), is most closely related to SRV-1 and SRV-2, which are the viruses that serve as the major causes of immunosuppressive disease in captive macaques. While SRV-1 is most typically detected in rhesus macaques and SRV-2 more commonly isolated from cynomolgus or pig-tailed macaques, animals housed in research environments may carry any of the serotypes or possibly multiple serotypes (Lerche and Osborn, 2003, Montiel, 2010).",

Investigation of an epizootic of SRV in captive Celebes black macaques (Macaca nigra) revealed an increase in the seropositive status from 0% to greater than 90% during an 8-year period following the introduction of several infected animals to the colony (Lerche et al., 1986, Shiigi et al., 1989). New World primates appear to be resistant to SRV infection in part due to species-specific variability in the TRIM5\u03b1 protein that is a major factor in determining host range of retroviral infections (Diehl et al., 2008). This protein facilitates premature dissociation of virus cores and subsequent proteasomal degradation.",

Wilkinson and colleagues determined that exposure to blood from viremic animals carried a higher risk of infection while blood from non-viremic animals with provirus integrated in circulating mononuclear cells was less likely to transmit infection (Wilkinson et al., 2003). Vertical transmission may play an additional role in the propagation of the virus within macaque colonies. Cesarean-derived infants raised in isolation may be infected (Tsai et al., 1990). Moreover, mother-to-infant transmission may occur in the perinatal or postnatal period. Of fundamental importance to the design and implementation of control strategies is the fact that animals may be persistently infected, healthy, and shedding virus while seronegative for antibodies against SRV. It is these seronegative virus-positive individuals that frustrate control strategies. Evidence suggests that in utero infection may be more likely to result in this seronegative, virus-positive status than transmission at other times (Moazed and Thouless, 1993). These animals may play a key role in viral persistence within colonies.",

In these nodes the paracortex is often depleted of lymphocytes and plasma cells, which are largely replaced by histiocytes and contain small postreactive follicles with hyalinized arterioles (Osborn et al., 1984).

To date these efforts have been very successful despite the difficulties in detecting infection. Because macaques may be seronegative but harbor virus, viral isolation or PCR to confirm virus-free status must be used in conjunction with serological methods of detection (White et al., 2009a). Successful algorithms used to establish retrovirus-free breeding colonies have been published (Schroder et al., 2000, Lerche and Osborn, 2003). These protocols utilize PCR detection of viral nucleic acid or viral isolation combined with antibody detection (EIA and Western blot) to screen all animals. Once established, colonies should be self-propagating and remain closed with periodic retesting to verify continued virus-free status.",

Serological and molecular techniques were also used to demonstrate possible SRV exposure with a relatively high frequency in healthy individuals from Guinea (Morozov et al., 1996). However, a survey of over 200 individuals occupationally exposed to nonhuman primates demonstrated a very low seroprevalence of 0.9% and virus was not able to be detected via viral isolation or molecular techniques (Lerche et al., 2001).

Analysis of a STLV-1 isolates obtained from a variety of nonhuman primate species demonstrate high degrees of homology with human isolates. This combined with a clustering by geography rather than by host species strongly suggests cross-species transmission events and a nonhuman primate origin of HTLV-1 (Sakesena et al., 1994, Mahieux et al., 1998, Van Dooren et al., 2001, Sintasath et al., 2009).",

The seventh clade G is populated by STLV-1 species isolated from Papio sp. (Koralnik et al., 1994). It is postulated that this diversity is due to repeated cross-species transmission within restricted geographic localities.

This has perhaps been best characterized in baboons (Voevodin et al., 1985, McCarthy et al., 1990, Hubbard et al., 1993). In this species, STLV-1 infection has been linked to the development of an ATLL-like syndrome characterized by non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and leukemia. Involvement of the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, skin, and especially lung is common. Overt leukemia has been documented in greater than 50% of the cases and is occasionally associated with the presence of circulating multilobulated neoplastic lymphocytes, a clinical feature of ATLL (McCarthy et al., 1990). Unlike human patients with ATLL, hypercalcemia is uncommon. Within the lung, the earliest changes may be present in a perivascular and/or peribronchiolar distribution. Although a variety of cell types have been recognized, most cases have been of T-cell lineage (CD2+ CD4+). Interestingly, an ATLL-like disease consisting of cells expressing CD8+ was identified in an African green monkey. Spontaneously transformed cell lines from STLV-1 infected African greens also consisted of CD8+ cells suggesting that STLV-1 may preferentially transform CD8+ cells in this species (Akari et al., 1998). Histologically, infiltrates vary from a monomorphic population of neoplastic lymphocytes to a more pleomorphic population accompanied by multinucleated giant cells, necrosis, and inflammatory cells.",

The tax gene product stimulates transcription of viral mRNA by acting on the 5\u2032 long terminal repeat (LTR) and is highly conserved among all STLV/HTLV isolates, suggesting a fundamental role in viral replication and disease pathogenesis (Sakesena et al., 1994). In addition to stimulating the 5\u2032 LTR, tax may activate host genes responsible for controlling T-cell proliferation, including c-fos, c-sis, interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-2r, and GM-CSF, thereby leading to polyclonal T-cell expansion. It is postulated that secondary events are required for monoclonal neoplastic transformation. Monoclonal integration of STLV-1 has been demonstrated in African green monkeys with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and preneoplastic lymphoproliferative disease (Tsujimoto et al., 1987). Such integration is considered definitive evidence of the etiologic role of PTLV in lymphomagenesis. Coinfection with other viral agents such as SIV or Epstein\u2013Barr-like viruses may promote neoplastic transformation (Voevodin et al., 1985, Traina-Dorge et al., 1992).",

Samples are initially screened by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and negative results indicate a provisional virus-free status. Positive results are further tested by confirmatory Western blot, and reacting animals are culled or segregated from the colony. Additionally, PCR should be used to test seronegative or seroindeterminant animals. Occasionally there may be long intervals to seroconversion indicating the need for continual monitoring for virus during the establishment of SPF colonies (Lerche and Osborn, 2003).",

Macaques infected with SIV develop many of the same clinical and pathologic abnormalities that occur in AIDS patients and die from the same array of opportunistic infections (OI). Using SIV-infected macaques as a model of human AIDS has produced a volume of research concerning all aspects of lentiviral biology and pathogenesis that cannot begin to be summarized here. The lessons to be reinforced from a standpoint of colony management and conservation are that (1) well-adapted viruses may be carried asymptomatically and silently by one primate species and yet have devastating consequences when introduced into another species and (2) the occurrence of unusual opportunistic infections should spur a vigorous search for an underlying immunosuppressive etiologic agent.",

Prevalence varies by species and geographical region although it can be quite high in some populations (Hayami et al., 1994). Other than in rare instances, these viruses do not cause disease in their natural hosts and only manifest as an immunodeficiency syndrome when transferred to a different species. Over 40 different SIV isolates from various African species have been recognized. Viral strains are designated by a three-letter suffix to indicate the common name of the species from which they were originally isolated (e.g., SIVcpz from chimpanzees). When distinct viruses have been isolated from different host subspecies, the subspecies is designated with a second suffix (SIVcpzPtt from P. troglodytes troglodytes and SIVcpzPts from P. troglodytes schweinfurthii). The relatedness of SIV isolates correlates most closely with speciation of the host (Franchini and Reitz, 1994). Phylogenetic analysis reveals that isolates from each nonhuman primate species form monophyletic lineages. While this suggests that there has been significant co-speciation of virus and host, there are also numerous instances of cross-species transmission and viral recombination. With the continued survey of African primates and discovery of novel SIVs, further genetic characterization of these isolates will only add to the complexity of the phylogenetic classification. Currently the monophyletic lineages can be grouped into seven major lineages or clades (Table 1.9\n).",

Similarities in the viral genomes combined with opportunities for geographic comingling and exposure via hunting provides strong evidence that the emergence of HIV-1 resulted from at least three cross-species transmission events between apes and man (Desrosiers, 1990, Gao et al., 1999\n;\nHahn et al., 2000). HIV-1 isolates are organized into three major groups, M\u2013O. Viruses in group M have spread globally thereby causing the HIV-1 pandemic. Viruses from groups N and O have remained confined to patients living in Cameroon and surrounding regions. The origins of HIV-1 groupings M and N have been traced to troops of Pan troglodytes troglodytes residing in southeastern and south central Cameroon where the prevalence of infection in apes can range as high as 35% (Keele et al., 2006). A divergent SIVcpzPtt lineage is thought to have given rise to SIVgor which shares closest homology to HIV-1 group O. Evidence suggests two possibilities for a source of HIV-1 group O: independent transmission events resulting in transfer of virus from Pan troglodytes troglodyes to both gorillas and humans or, alternatively, western lowland gorillas serving as an intermediate host and transmitting virus directly to humans (Van Heuverswyn et al., 2006, Takehisa et al., 2009). As of yet there is no known human counterpart to the SIV harbored by P. troglodytes schweinfurthii. P. troglodytes versus and P. troglodytes vellerosus have not been found to harbor SIV. The origin of SIVcpz is thought to be the result of a recombination event involving viruses from two distinct lineages; an ancestor of SIVrcm of red-capped mangabeys and an ancestor of the arboreal guenon clade (Bailes et al., 2003). Chimpanzees exposed to these primate species through hunting likely contracted both SIVrcm and SIVgsn ancestral viruses which led to recombination within the chimpanzee host and subsequent emergence of SIVcpz.",

Two co-circulating variants have been described in mustached monkeys ranging over a small region of Cameroon indicating that it is not necessarily geographic separation that results in divergent viral variants (Aghokeng et al., 2007). Four viruses in this group (SIVgsn, SIVmon, SIVmus, and SIVden) have a vpu gene. This accessory gene encodes a protein thought to enhance virion release and viral pathogenicity (Stephens et al., 2002). Originally it was believed that only HIV-1 and SIVcpz strains encoded a vpu gene. Identification of the vpu gene in SIVs of the arboreal guenon lineage provides further evidence that one of these viruses contributed the 3\u2019 segment to the SIVcpz genome during an ancient recombination event (Courgnaud et al., 2002, Barlow et al., 2003).",

The red-capped mangabey is closely related to sooty mangabeys, and viruses from both species contain a vpx gene. This would suggest that these viruses should cluster together. However, the pattern of clustering depends on the region of the SIVrcm genome examined. This genomic mosaicism indicates that the SIVrcm strain arose from multiple recombination events. The virus has thus been designated its own lineage. As mentioned previously, SIVcpz resulted from a recombination event between a SIVrcm-like virus and a guenon virus. SIVrcm uses the CCR2b co-receptor for viral entry rather than the more commonly used co-receptor CCR5.",

These isolates demonstrate a high degree of diversity and are the simian strains most closely related to HIV-2. As with SIVcpz and HIV-1, several cross-species transmission events between sooty mangabeys and man are thought to have contributed to the emergence of HIV-2 (Hirsch et al., 1989, Gao et al., 1992). HIV-2 isolates are arranged in groups A\u2013H with groups A and B representing epidemic strains. Sooty mangabeys from the Ivory Coast harbor SIVs related to HIV-2 groups A and B while those from Sierra Leone and Liberia harbor SIVs related to groups C\u2013H (Santiago et al., 2005). Like HIV-2, representatives from the sooty mangabey group have genomes containing a vpx gene. SIVsmm is ancestral to SIVmac from rhesus macaques, SIVmne from pig-tailed macaques, and SIVstm from stump-tailed macaques (Daniel et al., 1985, Benveniste et al., 1986, Murphey-Corb et al., 1986, Lowenstine et al., 1992, Apetrei et al., 2005).

SIVmnd-1 isolated from mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) residing in central and southern Gabon also clusters with the L\u2019Hoest lineage (Tsujimoto et al., 1988, Souquiere et al., 2001).

SIVmnd-2 shares some homology with SIVrcm suggesting that a recombination event between SIVrcm and SIVmnd-1 may have given rise to SIVmnd-2 (Souquiere et al., 2001). SIVdrl from drills (Mandrillus leucophaeus) also shows homology to SIVmnd-2 (Hu et al., 2003).",

            "text": "The lentivirus genome is approximately 10 kb in length and is diploid with two identical positive-sense RNA genomes contained within each viral core. The open reading frames include three genes encoding structural proteins (gag, pol, and env), two genes encoding regulatory proteins (tat, rev), and the genes encoding accessory proteins (vif, nef, vpr, vpu, vpx). The compliment of accessory genes varies by the viral isolate. The function of the viral proteins and process of lentiviral replication have been extensively reviewed and will only be discussed briefly here (Freed, 2001, Voevodin et al., 2009). The three structural protein genes are each expressed as a polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into multiple functional proteins. The SIV gag gene encodes the p55 precursor protein that is cleaved into the capsid (p27 protein homologous to the HIV major core protein p24), matrix (p17), nucleocapsid (p8), and p6 proteins. These proteins not only make up the viral capsid but are also integral to viral assembly. The pol gene encodes the viral enzymes protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase. The protease enzyme is involved in cleaving precursor peptides, the reverse transcriptase enzyme catalyzes the conversion of the RNA genome to a double-stranded DNA copy, and the integrase enzyme catalyzes the insertion of the viral DNA into the host cell chromosome. Each of these enzymes is a target for antiretroviral therapeutics. The env gene encodes two viral glycoproteins: the surface glycoprotein gp120 and the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41. The gp41 anchors gp120 and is involved in mediating fusion of the virus with host cell membranes during viral entry. The gp120 interacts with the CD4 molecule and a coreceptor to bind virus to the target cell and induces a conformational change in gp41 that promotes fusion of the virion envelope and the host cell plasma membrane. Most SIVs utilize the \u03b2-chemokine receptor CCR5 as the co-receptor for viral entry (Zhang et al., 2000).",

It is comprised of two exons encoding a protein that binds to the transactivation response region (TAR) of the viral genome to initiate and increase the rate of transcription. rev encodes a highly conserved protein that binds to the rev response element (RRE) on unspliced or partially spliced viral mRNAs to promote their export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. There are two additional accessory proteins commonly present in complex retroviruses. The vif gene encodes the viral infectivity factor that aborts the antiviral action of the host APOBEC protein system. The nef gene encodes a 27-kDa protein termed \u201cnegative factor.\u201d This protein has a variety of functions including downregulation of the CD3\u2013T cell receptor (CD3\u2013TCR) complex and MHC class I expression at the host cell surface thus impairing the ability of cytotoxic T cells to recognize infected cells.",

Epidemiologic assessment of SIVagm in Ethiopian grivet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops aethiops) suggests that sexual transmission is a significant mode of transmission in wild populations (Phillips-Conroy et al., 1994). The infection rate increases with sexual maturity in both captive and wild sooty mangabeys, further supporting this route as a major mechanism in the propagation of the virus in nonhuman primate populations (Fultz et al., 1990, Chen et al., 1996). Transmission via wounding is also likely a significant mode of transmission. Microsatellite analysis of isolates from sooty mangabey dams and infants confirms that vertical transmission does occur although this is not thought to be a major contributor to transmission (Santiago et al., 2005).",

Retrospective analysis of tissues achieved from outbreaks of opportunistic infections and malignant lymphoma in captive macaques that occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s demonstrated underlying SIV infection (Daniel et al., 1988, Lowenstine et al., 1992, Mansfield and Lackner, 1994, Mansfield et al., 1995). The close homology between one of the isolates (SIVstm) and SIVsmm suggested the source was sooty mangabeys. The virus was propagated within the captive macaque populations and resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. In another instance, macaques were inadvertently infected when inoculated with sooty mangabey-derived tissue containing Mycobacterium leprae (Gormus et al., 1989). Xenobiotic inoculation or transplantation of tissue carries the risk of introducing unsuspected or unknown agents into the recipient animal. Although such protocols clearly play an important role in biomedical research, and in this case led to the serendipitous establishment of the SIV model of HIV/AIDS, they should only be undertaken with realization of the potential risks involved. Recipient animals should be housed in an appropriate fashion to prevent the further transmission of such agents.",

The acute phase of infection in African species is similar in many respects to that observed in macaques. Peak virus production occurs within 1\u20133 weeks post-inoculation, innate and adaptive immune responses are initiated, and a partial control of viral replication enables achievement of the set point of viral replication. Virus replicates to high titer in both Asian and African species targeting the gut and lymphoid tissue and resulting in a depletion of CD4+ T cells at mucosal sites (Gordon et al., 2007, Pandrea et al., 2007). Asian species demonstrate peak viral loads of 107\u2013109 RNA copies/ml of plasma in line with or higher than those observed in normal rhesus macaque progression profiles (Broussard et al., 2001, Holzammer et al., 2001, Pandrea et al., 2006, Paiardini et al., 2009). In both species, acute infection is accompanied by modest declines in CD4+ T cell counts (Rey-Cuille et al., 1998). Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses of African primates appear to be comparable if not slightly diminished when compared to macaques (Zahn et al., 2008). From acute infection onward, distinct differences in pathophysiology between Asian and African species begin to emerge. In African species, CD4+ T cell numbers remain stable throughout chronic infection despite continued elevations in viral load that result in high set points of 104\u2013106 RNA copies/ml of plasma. Further loss of mucosal T cell populations does not occur in African species and mucosal immunity is preserved. In contrast, loss of both circulating and mucosal CD4+ T cells is progressive in rhesus macaques.",

A key factor may be the fact that there is a marked reduction in the degree of immune activation following transition from the acute to the chronic phase of infection. Activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells resulting in apoptosis of uninfected, bystander cells is believed to contribute substantially to the observed depletion of uninfected CD4+ and CD8+ T cells occurring with HIV/SIV progression to AIDS (Hazenberg et al., 2000, Hazenberg et al., 2003, Deeks et al., 2004, Holm and Gabuzda, 2005). By maintaining an anti-inflammatory phenotype, SIV-infected African species experience reduced activation-induced cell death and preservation of T cell homeostasis (Kornfeld et al., 2005, Cumont et al., 2008, Meythaler et al., 2009). The ability of the nef product of SIVsmm and SIVagm to more efficiently down-regulate the CD3-TCR from the surface of infected CD4+ T cells may contribute to reductions in immune activation (Brenchley et al., 2008). An additional contributing factor to the maintenance of CD4+ T cell counts in African species is the preservation of T cell regenerative capacity of bone marrow, thymus, and lymphoid compartments.",

Spleen and lymph node samples collected from a subset of animals demonstrated CD4+ T cell depletion and high levels of viral replication. Histopathological findings consistent with SAIDS were observed in one female. It is suggested that co-evolution of host and virus has allowed for development of a state of disease resistance in African hosts. The more recent SIVcpz emergence on an evolutionary time scale may not have allowed for sufficient virus-host adaptation.",

SIV encephalitis affects the gray and white matter of the spinal cord and brain and is composed of multifocal perivascular aggregates of giant cells and histiocytes with smaller numbers of lymphocytes and rare neutrophils. Surrounding these foci are evidence of myelin degeneration and the formation of scattered glial nodules. In situ hybridization shows that giant cells and histiocytes contain large amounts of replicating virus. Evidence shows that the CNS becomes uniformly infected during primary infection with pathogenic strains of SIVmac and yet only a small percentage of animals develop SIV encephalitis in the chronic phase of the disease (Lackner et al., 1991). The reason for this paradox is unknown, however, alterations in brain endothelium are likely critical because (1) SIV encephalitis is associated with an increased expression of VCAM-1 on brain endothelium and (2) inoculation of \u201cendothelial tropic\u201d viral strains accelerate and promote the occurrence of lesions within the CNS (Sasseville et al., 1992, Sasseville et al., 1994, Mankowski et al., 1994).

Although several opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium avium, Cryptosporidium parvum, Entamoeba spp., Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and cytomegalovirus may be responsible, in many instances secondary opportunistic agents are lacking. In these cases symptoms are attributed to a direct SIV enteropathy equivalent to AIDS enteropathy in humans. Experimental evidence now indicates that the gastrointestinal tract is a major target organ during primary infection due in large part to the number of CCR5+ CD4+ T lymphocytes that are normally present in mucosal tissue. These cells are rapidly depleted during primary infection resulting in compromise of mucosal immunity (Veazey et al., 1998). CD4+ T cell loss, as well as loss of intestinal epithelial cells, appears to result from apoptosis during the first 7\u201314 days post-inoculation (Li et al., 2008). Lesions are characterized by villous blunting and atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and presence of infiltrating macrophages. Compromise of the intestinal mucosa is thought to result in microbial translocation which may then enhance the systemic immune activation observed to correlate with SIV/HIV progression (Brenchley et al., 2006).",

Following a needle stick injury, one individual seroconverted, but the virus could not be isolated or demonstrated by PCR techniques (Khabbaz et al., 1992). In the second instance, the virus was isolated and could be demonstrated by PCR in the seropositive individual (Khabbaz et al., 1994). This laboratory worker had a history of working with the virus without gloves while receiving corticosteroids for dermatitis. Whether exposure occurred at this time is unknown. In both instances CD4+ T cell counts remained stable suggesting non-progressive disease. Seroconversion of a laboratory worker was also discovered during an anonymous serologic survey (CDC, 1992a).

Originally classified by serotype, viruses are currently named according to the host species of origin (i.e. SFVcpz). Phylogenetics demonstrates significant co-evolution of virus and host species (Switzer et al., 2005). Prevalence in all nonhuman primate species is high and, depending on the species, colony, or habitat, often approaches 100% (Blewett et al., 2000, Hussain et al., 2003, Liu et al., 2008). Proviral DNA can be isolated from most organs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells indicating widespread latent infection (Falcone et al., 1999). In contrast, viral RNA is produced at high levels primarily in tissues of the oropharynx suggesting that this is the major site of SFV replication (Murray et al., 2006, Murray et al., 2008).

The species simian enterovirus A includes the isolates SA4, SV4, and SV28 (Oberste et al., 2007). SV2, the first isolated simian enterovirus, has recently been designated a member of the tentative genus Sapelovirus (Oberste et al., 2003, Victoria et al., 2008). Greater than 200 serotypes within these species have been described and, since 1969, have been numbered sequentially. For instance, EV92 indicates the 92nd enterovirus isolate while SV19 indicates the 19th simian isolate. Other designations include CV indicating coxsackievirus isolates.

Rhesus macaques and chimpanzees were susceptible to experimental infection and, although viral shedding and seroconversion occurred, animals did not develop gastroenteritis (Wyatt et al., 1978, Rockx et al., 2005).

The fulfillment of Koch\u2019s postulates via experimental infection of nonhuman primates enabled establishment of a link between the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and this severe respiratory epidemic (Kuiken et al., 2003). Inoculation of rhesus macaques via intranasal or intratracheal routes resulted in evidence of diffuse alveolar damage characterized by the accumulation of edema, fibrin, and cellular debris within alveolar spaces and accompanied by epithelial desquamation, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, hyaline membrane formation, and syncytial cells (Kuiken et al., 2003). Despite the characteristic appearance of the described lesions, most experimental infections in nonhuman primates do not reach the level of severity observed in human patients succumbing to respiratory failure (McAuliffe et al., 2004). A more recent report suggests that infection of aged macaques resulted in a stronger innate immune response and thus was associated with lesions of greater severity (Smits et al., 2010). Common marmosets also have demonstrated utility as an animal model of SARS-CoV (Greenough et al., 2005). Intratracheally inoculated marmosets developed a multifocal to coalescing pneumonitis with multinucleate syncytia and type 2 hyperplasia. Diffuse alveolar damage was not observed. Infected animals also demonstrated a multifocal hepatitis and mild diffuse colitis sharing features of extrapulmonary disease reported in human patients.",
