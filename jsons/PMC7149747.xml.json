Chemiluminescent processes constitute a very special class of chemical reactions in which products (or intermediates) are produced in electronically excited states that are very short-lived and rapidly decay with concomitant emission of light. Similar chemiluminescent reactions, called bioluminescence, occur in nature in species as diverse as the firefly (Photinus pyralis), marine bacteria (Vibrio harveyi), and others. Most chemiluminescence reactions involve oxidations of a variety of organic compounds as well as naturally occurring materials, resulting in the generation of light-emitting excited states. This phenomenon was first described with synthetic organic compounds in 1877 (Radziszewski, 1877).",

Nevertheless, chemiluminescence has been used effectively as a very sensitive detection system in many applications (Carter and Kricka, 1982; Harber, 1982; Kricka and Carter, 1982), largely because no background light signals are generated since the emitting excited state is created in a dark chemical reaction (compared to scattered excitation light in fluorescence.) Therefore, in theory, every photon detected is a true signal of the assay. This feature of chemiluminescent molecules\u2014coupled with long shelf-life, elimination of hazards associated with the use of radioisotopes, and their detectability at 10\u221221 moles (detection of alkaline phosphatase with chemiluminescent dioxetane substrate; Kricka, 1992)\u2014makes them ideal as a reporter system for immunoassays and DNA probe hybridization assays.",

DNA probes are labeled with alkaline phosphatase either indirectly, with a biotin or hapten label followed by binding streptavidin- or antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugates, or directly by covalent bonding to enzyme (oligonucleotide probes). Biotin has been the most popular ligand for indirect labeling, but hapten labels other than biotin have also been employed including digoxigenin, fluorescein, and 2,4-dinitrophenyl. Dioxetane-based chemiluminescent indirect labeling and detection systems for DNA hybridization assays, as well as for immunoassays and DNA sequencing, are widely available from many commercial suppliers. With a nick-translated biotinylated DNA probe, as little as 380 fg (7.9 \u00d7 104 copies) of target pBR322 DNA can be detected on a Southern blot (Bronstein et al., 1990). Using digoxigenin-labeled random-primed DNA probes with a membrane-based assay and photographic film detection, a sensitivity level of 10\u201350 fg of target DNA was obtained for the detection of purified cytomegalovirus (CMV) or parvovirus B19 DNA (Musiani et al., 1991a).",

N-Methyl acridinium esters react with hydrogen peroxide under basic conditions to yield an excited state N-methylacridone which emits light at 430 nm (reviewed by Nelson and Kacian, 1990). Oligonucleotide DNA probes can be labeled convalently with AEs by reaction of modified N-hydroxysuccinimide-AE with a primary alkyl amine on a linker arm that was previously incorporated during oligonucleotide synthesis (Nelson and Kacian, 1990). Preparation of AE-labeled oligonucleotide probes has also been described by Septak (1989).

Ru(bpy)3\n2+-labeled oligonucleotide probe was then hybridized to the particle-bound DNA, washed, and quantified. A linear response was generated over the range of 50 to 2000 gene copies, and the detection of less than 10 copies of the HIV-1 gag was attained. An automated system for electrochemiluminescence quantification of PCR products (QPCR System 5000; Perkin-Elmer Corporation, Norwalk, CT) has been developed (DiCesare et al., 1993) and is used for detection of viral disease. This system provides detection limits of 10\u2013200 amol and a linear dynamic range greater than three orders of magnitude. The system has been used for the detection of HIV-1 over a range of 3 to 106 copies of target DNA (Wages et al., 1993).",

Two bioluminescent reaction systems have been used for DNA hybridization assays, both of which are coupled enzymatic reactions. One system, used for membrane-based DNA hybridization, couples the production of d-luciferin from d-luciferin-O-phosphate, catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase (as a direct or indirect label) and the oxidation of d-luciferin, catalyzed by firefly luciferase, with concomitant light emission (Hauber and Geiger, 1987,1988; Hauber et al., 1988,1989; Geiger, 1992). The other system, used with both membrane-based and solution hybridization assays, couples reactions catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), NAD(P)H: FMN oxidoreductase, and marine bacterial luciferase to produce the light (Balaguer et al., 1989a,b,1991a,b; Nicolas et al., 1990,1992). Although bioluminescence-based DNA detection systems have not become as widely used as chemiluminescence systems for DNA hybridization assays, they do offer another alternative for sensitive nonradioactive biomolecule detection.",

Serial dilutions of plasmid DNA were hybridized with alkaline phosphastase-labeled oligonucleotide probe, incubated with chemiluminescent substrate, and imaged on photographic film. Each photograph corresponds to a 30-min exposure. With this chemiluminescence assay, 1.18 \u00d7 106 copies of HBVc DNA can be detected within 30 min of substrate incubation. After a 2-hr incubation, 4.39 \u00d7 104 copies can be detected. In contrast, with the colorimetric bromochloroindolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) substrate system, 9.8 \u00d7 107 and 1.07 \u00d7 107 copies can be detected after 30 min or 2 hr of substrate incubation, respectively (results not shown). Quantitative results were obtained by measuring reflection densities from the imaged photographic film using a black and white reflection densitometer (Fig. 3\n). These values could be used to establish a dose-response curve for the reflection densities as a function of HBVc plasmid concentration, from which HBVc DNA levels in clinical specimens could be determined. Use of the improved chemiluminescence detection protocol, incorporating the diethanolamine substrate buffer and CSPD chemiluminescent substrate, results in even greater sensitivity for DNA hybridization assays and would increase the sensitivity of this HBV DNA assay. Imaging and quantification of this membrane-based assay with rapidly evolving CCD camera systems will likely provide even greater sensitivity and a greater linear dynamic range than that achieved with densitometry.",
