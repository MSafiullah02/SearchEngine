            "text": "Combat medicine is an ebb and flow of casualties. Several days may pass when there are no casualties, followed by an onslaught of wounded. Casualties from explosive devices, such as those seen in Operation Iraqi Freedom and civilian terrorist attacks, tend to result in a large number of casualties at one time. This paradigm does not lend itself to component therapy. Packed RBCs, plasma, and crystalloid solutions may be in abundance, but a five-day shelf life prohibits the banking of platelets. The casualties who receive massive transfusions (> 10 units packed RBCs) quickly deplete precious stores. FFP bags, not designed to support the temperature (\u00b170 8F) associated with dry ice used during transport, become brittle and break one third of the time during the thawing process. Platelets generated by plasmapheresis became available only two years after the start of the war in Iraq, require significant and dedicated resources and availability remains limited. Limited blood products, manpower shortages, and warming methods increase the vulnerability of wounded soldiers to the onset of a second enemy: hypothermia, acidosis and coagulopathy.",

Predetermined donors are mobilized and fresh whole blood is collected, tested, and given to the wounded. Fresh whole blood protocols were followed in post-war Kosovo and in Somalia where over 120 units of fresh whole blood were collected and administered to critically wounded patients [1, 2] . A combat support hospital deployed to Baghdad transfused 598 units of fresh whole blood over a 6 month period [3] . Reports of the rapid positive response of recipients to fresh whole blood are thought-provoking and suggest profound possibilities for fresh whole blood transfusion. In combat, fresh whole blood for massive transfusion becomes a blood bank multiplier, providing within a single unit, RBCs, volume, coagulation components, and functional platelets in a warm fluid.",

In Vietnam, tested units of packed RBCs and crystalloid solutions (lactated Ringer's) were used and the incidence of infectious disease decreased. However, complications of the switch from fresh whole blood to stored RBCs became evident in Vietnam as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or`Da Nang Lung' was so prevalent that it became the focus of thousands of studies and book chapters. In comparison, very few cases of ARDS were described during World War II and none during Korea despite the administration of large volumes of whole blood and colloid [4] .",

            "text": "These observations from the front lines of the advantages of fresh whole blood transfusion have been borne out in the civilian literature. In particular, two well designed, prospective studies support the clinical testimony of combat surgeons that fresh whole blood improves coagulopathy and decreases blood loss when compared to component therapy. The first study randomized cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) patients to receive either one unit of fresh whole blood or 10 units of platelet concentrates after surgery [6] . The patients who received one unit of fresh whole blood increased platelet counts by 34 \u00d4 17\u00b410 9 /l, an increase equivalent to four to six units of platelets. Platelet aggregation response to collagen and epinephrine after fresh whole blood transfusion was superior to that achieved by 10 units of platelets. Furthermore, bleeding time after administration of one unit of fresh whole blood approximately equaled bleeding time following eight units of platelets. In the second study, the beneficial effects of fresh whole blood on the coagulation cascade were demonstrated in a double-blinded, randomized controlled study comparing the use of fresh whole blood less than 24 hours old (n = 52), fresh whole blood between 24 and 48 hours old (n = 57), and reconstituted blood using packed RBCs, plasma, and platelets (n = 52), in a pediatric population undergoing CPB operations [7] . The 24-hour blood loss was no different between the two whole blood groups. The group that received reconstituted products had an increase in average blood loss that was significantly greater than either of the fresh whole blood groups (p = 0.03). After age stratification, the 24-hour blood loss for children less than 2 years old who received reconstituted blood was 85% greater than those who received fresh whole blood (p = 0.001). When platelet aggregation times were compared among the three groups, the group that received the reconstituted blood had a greater incidence of abnormal studies in the presence of the agonists ADP, epinephrine and collagen (p < 0.001, p = 0.02, and p = 0.007, respectively). Other recent studies have linked increasingly negative outcomes to each unit of packed RBCs received.",

This flow diagram is the massive transfusion/fresh whole blood transfusion protocol employed by the 31 st Combat Support Hospital, while serving in Baghdad, Iraq. This is a two-pronged approach where patients are identified early and the mechanism for obtaining fresh whole blood initiated. Patients receive emergency release packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and when available are transitioned to fresh whole blood. This transition time coincides with the point where platelet transfusion would likely be indicated. FFP: fresh frozen plasma; cryoppt: cryoprecipitate. From [3] with permission stances and protocols have been established that delineate the clinical guidelines for determining who should receive fresh whole blood. Figure 1 illustrates one such protocol employed at a combat support hospital [3] . Fresh whole blood was requested when large quantities of blood were required in order to save life and when the onset of coagulopathy and the need for platelets was imminent. This protocol illustrates a two-pronged approach in the event a massive transfusion is required. First, uncrossmatched, Type O packed cells are made available as emergency-release blood and the`massive transfusion' protocol is initiated. At the same time, since there are usually no platelets and nominal FFP and cryoprecipitate available on the battlefield, the`walking blood bank' of predetermined donors is activated so that required coagulation factors and components can be provided in the form of fresh whole blood. The first unit of fresh whole blood usually becomes available in about 120 minutes and the surgical team transitions to fresh whole blood as an adjunct to the massive transfusion protocol [3] . Many civilian hospitals utilize this template of a`massive transfusion protocol' where, upon activation, predetermined quantities of packed RBCs, FFP, platelets and cryoprecipitate are sent at scheduled time intervals. The main difference is the effort to obtain fresh whole blood and the transition to whole blood transfusion.",

Levels of inflammatory cytokines are elevated to a greater extent in patients with severe blood loss when compared to patients with isolated trauma. Additionally, the degree of elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines correlates with severity of injury [18, 19] . When blood transfusion, which is inherently pro-inflammatory, is combined with the inflammatory response associated with trauma, the result is an exacerbated acute phase response [20] . This exacerbated inflammatory response is associated with increased infectious complications and increased mortality [19] . A biphasic inflammatory response begins, with initial proinflammation followed by immunosupression which begins at about 24 hours [18] . It is during the subsequent phase of immunosuppression that the patient is most susceptible to infection. Historically, this immunosuppressive effect was actually used to the advantage of the patient. Prior to the use of cyclosporine, blood transfusion was used in transplant patients as an immunosuppressant, improving outcomes [21] .",

A prospective trial demonstrated a significantly increased rate of nosocomial infection of 15.4% in 412 patients who received transfusions compared to a 2.9% rate in 1,301 control patients who did not receive transfusions [22] . There was a dose-related response between the number of units of packed RBCs received and the risk of developing a nosocomial infection. Additionally, patients who received transfusions showed increased mortality, length of ICU stay, and hospital stay (p < 0.05). This single-center prospective trial corroborated the observations of several basic science studies. Detrimental immunomodulation is thought to occur following increased production of both serum and tissue tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-8, interacting with soluble cytokine receptors [23] . Fransen et al. showed that surgical patients who received packed RBCs compared to those who did not had increased levels of IL-6 (p < 0.01) and bactericidal permeability increasing protein (BPI) (p < 0.05), which is a marker of neutrophil activation [20] . In addition to these serum markers of inflammation, patients who received transfusions had increased ventilator time (42 \u00d4 12 vs. 22 \u00d4 2 h, p < 0.025) and increased ICU days (45 \u00d4 6 vs. 89 \u00d4 21, p < 0.025) [20] . Transfusion of blood components has also been associated with impaired natural killer cell function and decreased helper-suppressor cell ratios as well as effects on B lymphocytes [24] . Again, there appeared to be a linear relationship between the amount of blood transfused and the degree of impairment [24] .",

One theory is that immune system derangement is the result of the storage age of blood. Gastric mucosal pH can be used as an indicator of oxygenation of the gastric mucosa or the organs of splanchnic distribution and studies have shown that direct measurements of gastric mucosal pH are related to the age of the blood transfused to critically ill patients [25, 26] . Two mechanisms that have been proposed to account for the inability of old transfused RBCs to improve systemic oxygen consumption include a left shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve due to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) depletion with storage, and loss of the RBC compliance and the ability to deform, impeding delivery of oxygen to the microcirculation [27] . Another emerging theory speculates that due to the high affinity of nitric oxide (NO) with free hemoglobin, cell-free ferrous hemoglobin in the plasma is oxidized to methemoglobin and nitrates that rapidly destroy NO [28, 29] . The decreased availability of NO results in regional and systemic vasoconstriction.",

Several variants of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers attempted in the past were either abandoned by the developing company or discontinued in phase III trials out of concern for patient safety [30] . Concerns about hemoglobinbased oxygen carriers are their effects on vasoactivity resulting from binding of NO by hemoglobin and subsequent hypertension. Currently, however, in the United States a phase III trial of pyridoxalated hemoglobin (Polyheme, Northfield Laboratories, Evanston, IL.) is 50% completed. This multicenter pre-hospital trial is examining the administration of hemoglobin based oxygen carriers to trauma patients in severe hemorrhagic shock.

The higher dose group showed significant decreases in blood loss (p < 0.01) and surgical time (p < 0.05) and elimination of packed RBC transfusion requirements [47] . On the other hand, studies regarding the proper administration of rFVIIa have elucidated that rFVIIa is ineffective as a`last resort' [48] . We recommend that the administration of rFVIIa follow a clinical protocol according to set guidelines for dose and other parameters in order to optimize success. One early guideline published by Dutton et al. outlines the use of clinical \u00aagatekeepers\u00ba who are available to assess the patient and clinical circumstances surrounding the administration of rFVIIa [49] . Criteria include evidence of ongoing active hemorrhage, with clinical evidence of coagulopathy, and ongoing utilization of conventional transfusion and hemostatic therapy which must be judged unlikely to succeed. Patients must have received at minimum 10 units of RBCs, eight units of FFP, one unit of platelets, with continued derangement of coagulation studies and ongoing hemorrhage. This approach reserves rFVIIa for the most critically injured.",

Though this cost appears exorbitant, most studies demonstrate a reduction in blood product requirements, which in turn should translate to lower costs and prevention of subsequent infection and deleterious inflammatory response. Efforts are also being taken to decrease cost by making rFVIIa more efficient. In a rat model of hemophilia, thre\u00e8 super analogs' of rFVIIa were compared with rFVIIa [50] . The rFVIIa groups received 1, 3, 6 or 10 mg/kg, and the super-analog groups 1 or 3 mg/kg. Two of the 3 mg/kg groups of the super-analogs and the 10 mg/kg group of rFVIIa showed significant improvement in bleeding times (p < 0.001) when compared to the hemophilia control group. Average blood loss was reduced in the 3, 6 and 10 mg/kg groups of rFVIIa (p < 0.05) and in all groups of the super-analog, including the 1 mg/kg groups (p < 0.05). A dose response was seen between the 1 and 3 mg/kg groups of all three super-analogs, with decreased blood volumes in the higher dose super analog groups (p < 0.001) [50] . With further research and the development of rFVIIa analogs with greater potency, we hope to see the cost associated with this drug decrease while effectiveness increases.",

What is needed is a fluid which contains the oxygen-carrying capability as well as the volume and hemostatic qualities provided by fresh whole blood. For hemostatic resuscitation on the battlefield we also envision a fluid that is stable at room temperature and has a long shelf life. Additionally, a fluid that can transport oxygen, possibly by a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier could serve as a volume expander and contain active clotting factors and platelets, like those found in freeze-dried plasma, platelets, fibrinogen and recombinant factor VIIa. Being fielded forward to the point of injury, this fluid could prevent the onset of coagulopathy and decrease blood product transfusion requirements, all in hope of improving survival. Fascinating and promising products on the horizon may make hemostatic resuscitation a possibility.",

Fresh whole blood has three vital properties: oxygen carrying capacity, volume, and hemostatic effect. In the austere environment of combat the practice of fresh whole blood transfusion has proven beneficial to patients who are coagulopathic and require massive transfusion. Appropriate use following established guidelines can be beneficial and may even be superior to packed RBCs.
