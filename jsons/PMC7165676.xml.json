This is in agreement with our earlier finding that there is a gradually increasing discrepancy in CBCT and symptom scores between bacterial and nonbacterial ARS that begins at the start of the symptoms.21 Furthermore, we have shown earlier that the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the nasal middle meatus (coinfection) at the beginning of viral ARS modifies the symptoms and is one factor that may lead to the finding of the same bacteria in the maxillary sinus.9 However, here the middle meatal NTHi was not associated with raised CRP or decreased nNO. This raises the question of whether the pathogenic bacteria were already present in the maxillary sinus at the beginning of symptoms. We do not know this because we performed the maxillary sinus aspirations and bacterial cultures at the follow\u2010up visit.

We have earlier examined the respective figures for various symptoms and clinical findings in this same material.20 Compared to these diagnostic measures, the finding of elevated CRP (\u2265 11 mg/L) proved to be better at predicting bacterial ARS than symptoms; it paralleled the findings of moderate or profuse amount of nasal secretion and cervical adenopathy but was poorer than the finding of nasal secretion in the posterior pharynx (supplementary material). Moderately elevated CRP (\u2265 49 mg/L) accurately predicted bacterial ARS but only was present in four patients. Because of the relatively high negative likelihood ratios, the absence of elevated CRP could not be used to rule out bacterial ARS.

Here, the nasopharyngeal findings of multiple viruses, adenovirus, or influenza A virus was associated with the inflammatory response. Earlier, Ruuskanen et al. found elevated CRP in influenza and adenovirus infections, and Melbye in influenza infections.17, 27 Savolainen et al. and Hansen et al. have shown that clearly pathological values of CRP associate with bacterial ARS but have not calculated their sensitivity, specificity, or predictive values for this finding.18, 19 Patients with radiologic sinusitis have been found to have lower maxillary sinus NO levels than control subjects.28 One proposed mechanism for this is blockage of the sinus ostia, which reduces NO levels in nasally exhaled air.29 In support of this, we found that bacterial ARS involved lower nNO levels than nonbacterial ARS and that ostiomeatal occlusion confirmed by imaging associated with low nNO levels.",

We were not able to verify viral etiology in all the subjects, similar to prior research on natural colds.30 We did not perform maxillary sinus aspiration to every patient, but only to those with CBCT findings that supported bacterial ARS. This might have caused information bias. However, CT is considered to be the best imaging modality for evaluating paranasal sinus disease.10 We defined bacterial ARS to include only the maxillary sinuses for which sinus aspirate is possible. Due to available resources, the study group was relatively small. Despite this, we found significant associations between hs\u2010CRP and nNO levels and various clinical parameters. We wanted to increase the possibility of encountering frequent bacterial ARS; therefore, conscripts were recruited. The amount of patients who get bacterial sinusitis during ARS in primary care usually is estimated to be 2%10, 11 We would have needed 400 such patients to get the eight cases of bacterial ARS that we had in this study.",

Smoking was common but did not correlate with the biomarker levels. The only bacteria that we found from the maxillary sinuses were NTHi. This is probably explained by the fact that NTHi earlier had been reported to be a major nasal and paranasal pathogen among Finnish conscripts.31, 32 Overall, the present finding of ARS involving an inflammatory response warrants reconfirmation among other patients and bacteria.",
