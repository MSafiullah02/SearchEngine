The refinement of the BN-S model is obtained with various machine and deep learning algorithms. The refinement leads to the extraction of a deterministic parameter from the empirical data set. The problem is transformed to an appropriate classification problem with a couple of different approaches-the volatility approach and the duration approach. The analysis is implemented to the Bakken crude oil data and the aforementioned deterministic parameter is obtained for a wide range of data sets. With the implementation of this parameter in the refined model, the resulting model performs much better than the classical BN-S model.",

This allows to evaluate the potential impacts of its shocks in several economies and on other financial assets. In [22] , the authors analyze the efficiency of crude oil markets by means of estimating the fractal structure of these time series. In [20] , it is shown that the efficiency of energy futures markets is time-varying and changes drastically over the sample period. In particular, for futures contracts with one to four months to maturities, crude oil and gasoline are found to be more efficient compared to others. In [5] , the authors discuss how the traditional oil producers may react in counter-intuitive ways in face of competition from alternative energy sources. The paper considers the big decline in oil prices, from around $110 per barrel in June 2014 to less than $40 in March 2016, and shows the significance of competition between different energy sources. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic situation, this analysis is very relevant. In [15] , the authors present a sequential hypothesis testing on two streams of observations that are driven by L\u00e9vy processes. After that, machine learning algorithms are implemented to analyze the oil price dynamics for the Bakken region in the United States.",

This model finds various applications in the derivative and commodity market. In recent literature, the BN-S model is implemented to find an optimal hedging strategy for the oil commodity (see [19, 23] ). In [14] , the BN-S model is implemented to the analysis of the S&P 500 market using a K-component mixture of regressions model. In spite of having a lot of advantages, the classical BN-S model has some major disadvantages including a \"short-range dependence\". In the recent paper [18] , a refinement of the BN-S model is proposed. It is shown that a machine learning driven refined BN-S model can be used as an improvement of the classical BN-S model. The analysis is further improved in [16] , where a machine learning driven sequential hypothesis testing is implemented to refine the BN-S model. In both the papers ( [16] and [18] ), machine learning based techniques are implemented for extracting a deterministic component from the commodity price processes. Also, the refined BN-S model is shown to incorporate long range dependence without actually changing the model.",

            "text": "In this paper, we investigate the refinement of the BN-S model by analyzing the underlying data set with a couple of different approaches-(1) volatility approach, and (2) duration approach. In effect, these approaches provide a \"jump-detection technique\" for a financial time series. The papers [11, 12, 13, 21] , discuss various motivations for these approaches. In [11] , it is observed that by fitting the log-periodic power law equation to a financial time series, it is possible to predict the event of a crash. The paper investigates the financial crisis of 2008, with the log-periodic power law. In [12] , drawdowns, defined as the loss from the last local maximum to the next local minimum, is introduced. It is shown that drawdowns can be used as a natural measure of real market risks than the variance, the value-at-risk or other measures based on fixed time scale distributions of returns. It is shown that very large drawdowns belong to a different class of their own and call for a specific amplification mechanism. In [13] , drawdowns are implemented and crashes are classified as either events of an endogenous origin preceded by speculative bubbles or as events of exogenous origins associated to external shocks. However, the proposed classification does not rule out the existence of other precursory signals in the absence of so-called log-periodic power law signatures. In [21] , the price volatility before, during, and after financial asset bubbles are investigated for possible commonalities. It is also empirically investigated whether volatility may be used as an indicator or an early warning signal of an unsustainable price increase and the associated crash.",

The purpose of the heatmap in Figure 4 is to better understand the realized volatility calculated over a period of twenty days for our entire data set. The goal is to use the numerical values and color pattern to observe any big changes for every month over the period of five years. As we can see that the realized volatility have very small values. This motivates us in computing realized volatility return in percentage. This is shown in Figure 5 . For Figure 5 , using the numerical values and color pattern from the heatmap we observe that over the five years the realized volatility return in percentage does not have any drastic change except for one outlier on July 2017. Figure 6 and Figure 7 represent line plots which show us the jumps in the realized volatility return in percentage and the realized volatility over the five years, respectively. With the help of these figures we can see the highest jumps over the years, which also provides help in writing Step-4 of the above procedure. Next, we present the second approach to our data analysis. We implement the following procedure, naming it, Duration Approach, to create a classification problem for the data set.",

With the help of the bar graph in Figure 8 , we can see that most drawdowns last for short period duration. For example, a more likely duration is of one or two days, compared to long duration of eight or nine days. In Figure 9 , the spikes in the line plot give us some idea about the changes associated with the drawdowns in terms of duration (in number of days), over the period of five years. For example, between 2014 and 2015 most drawdowns lasted for one day or two days, and very few drawdowns went past four days. From these two approaches we will show that we can find \u03b8 with reasonable accuracy and use this for (2.4) . In both the Volatility Approach and the Duration Approach the result can be improved by adjusting the number of days (in Step 5 for both) from twenty and ten respectively to a higher number. It is worth noting that the various deep learning models provide a value of \u03b8 between 0 and 1. In Step 6 (for both), we approximate that by 0 or 1.

Firms and organizations deal with these risks in different ways. A refined version of the major tractable stochastic model-the BN-S modelis implemented in the present paper for minimizing the quadratic hedging error. As shown in this paper, there are certain advantages of this model relative to traditional and conventional appropriates. The theoretical results are implemented for the data analysis of the Bakken oil price. But, the procedure and analysis presented in this paper, in principle, can also be performed to other financial commodities. The procedure presented in this paper also shows a data science driven approach to deal with the stochastic models for the commodity market. It is shown that a data science driven approach can be used to effectively modify stochastic models. The resulting model can be enacted to better analyze the commodity markets.",

            "text": "The two approaches discussed in the data analysis section of this paper are attempts to identify crash-like days. At the same time, it portrays the potential of merging the data science with stochastic models. In this paper, we apply various supervised and deep learning techniques to identify \u03b8 by working in conjunction with realized volatility and duration of drawdown of oil prices, respectively. Nonetheless, there is still room for further refinement of these discussed approaches. For the Volatility Approach, rather than simply looking at the maximum realized volatility return in percentage over a period of twenty consecutive days in Step-4 of this particular approach, one can look into the mean of the realized volatility return in percentage over twenty consecutive days, or look at the highest positive jump in realized volatility over five years. These will result in two different approaches. As it can be observed from this paper, data science driven approaches, and especially deep learning techniques can be a valuable resource into effective modification and efficient analysis of the stochastic models for the commodity market.",
