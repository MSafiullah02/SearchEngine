The signs and symptoms of GAS and nonstreptococcal pharyngitis overlap so broadly that accurate diagnosis on the basis of clinical grounds alone is unreliable. Therefore, it is advisable for family physicians to follow the ISDA clinical practice guidelines for proper diagnostic test use and antibiotic prescription for all children with GAS where possible (Table 1). In addition to viral pharyngitis, other less common or rare causes of pharyngitis must also be considered when the tests for GAS are negative, or the clinical picture is suggestive. Infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus and diphtheria caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae are examples [12].",

Adherence to the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis can decrease unnecessary diagnostic testing and intervention. In most previously healthy children, an RSV infection is self-limited and responds to supportive care. Children with unrepaired cardiac disease or chronic lung disease are at increased risk of severe RSV infection. Premature children and the very young (less than 3 months old) tend to be more at risk of having severe symptoms and therefore may require hospitalization.",

Bacterial tracheitis does not respond to usual croup treatment. Intravenous antibiotics are needed, and intubation may become necessary. Epiglottitis ( supraglottitis) is a life-threatening bacterial infection of the upper airway almost always caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). The incidence has declined dramatically as a result of the use of Hib vaccine. Other diagnoses to consider include foreign body aspiration, peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, and angioedema [19].

            "text": "KD is an acute vasculitis of childhood that predominantly affects the coronary arteries. An infectious etiology is suspected based on epidemiological and clinical data; however as of today, the cause of KD remains unknown. In the United States, KD is more common during the winter and early spring months, in boys more than girls, in children younger than 5 years old, and in children of Asian ethnicity [27]. The classic clinical presentation of KD includes at least 5 days of fever plus four or more of the five major clinical features (conjunctival injection, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, polymorphous skin rash, cervical lymphadenopathy (with one of the nodes being at least 1.5 cm in diameter),and swelling or redness of the extremities). The classic peeling of the fingers and toes (starting in the periungual region) usually does not occur until 2\u20133 weeks after onset of symptoms. In addition, classic KD can be diagnosed with three of the above clinical features if coronary artery abnormalities are observed on echocardiography. \u201cIncomplete KD\u201d refers to patients who do not fulfill the classic criteria and is more common in children younger than 1 year. In this group, the rate of coronary artery aneurysms is paradoxically higher if not treated. Some children with KD develop coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia, ischemic heart disease, and sudden death. Therefore early clinical suspicion and diagnosis are important [28]. Nonspecific lab tests such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) may suggest the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease because they are often unusually highly elevated. In patients with compatible features, and elevated CRP levels or ESR, supplemental laboratory test results are often seen (these include leukocytosis with shift to the left, mild anemia, thrombocytosis, proteinuria and sterile pyuria on urine analysis, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated serum transaminases). Cardiac manifestations for any suspected case of KD might be detected earlier by performing echocardiography. Initial treatment with a single dose (2 g per kg) of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and high-dose aspirin (80\u2013100 mg per kg per day, divided into four doses) is recommended. Treatment is preferably started as soon as possible, optimally within the first 10 days of fever; however, treatment is still recommended if patients present after 10 days and still have fever and manifestations of inflammation. Low-dose aspirin (3\u20135 mg per kg per day, given as a single dose) has an antiplatelet effect and should be continued for 6\u20138 weeks after disease onset if there are no coronary artery abnormalities or indefinitely if abnormalities are present. Children on long-term aspirin therapy should receive an annual influenza vaccination. Also, parents should be told to contact their physician if symptoms of influenza or varicella arise, because alternative agents to aspirin might be considered. Children who have Kawasaki disease without evidence of abnormalities on echocardiography appear to return to their usual state of health without any cardiac sequelae. The current American Heart Association guidelines provide a stratification system to categorize patients by their risk of myocardial infarction and provide guidelines for management [27, 28].\n",

            "text": "The clinical presentation is the mainstay of diagnosis, and therefore careful history and physical examination will serve to differentiate gastroenteritis from other causes of vomiting and diarrhea in children. These will also help in estimating the degree of dehydration. Diarrhea is the main presenting symptom and is usually defined as three or more watery or loose stools in 24 h. The duration of diarrhea, the frequency and amount of stool, the time since the last episode of diarrhea, and the quality of stools must also be determined. Frequent, watery stools are more consistent with viral gastroenteritis, while stools with blood or mucous are indicative of a likely bacterial pathogen. Similarly, a long duration of diarrhea (>14 days) is more consistent with a parasitic or noninfectious cause of diarrhea. Vomiting is another important symptom, the duration of vomiting, the amount and quality of vomitus (e.g., food contents, blood, bile), and the time since the last episode of vomiting must be determined. Signs of systemic infection must be noted (fever, chills, myalgias, rash, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough). Abdominal pain is another important symptom that the child or parent can report; in general, pain that precedes vomiting and diarrhea is more likely to be due to an abdominal pathology other than gastroenteritis. Urinary symptoms including frequency (measured by the number of wet diapers), time since last urination, color and concentration of urine, and presence of dysuria should be sought. Some important points in the general appearance and behavior are important to determine the degree of dehydration and subsequent management (weight loss, level of thirst, level of alertness, increased malaise, lethargy or irritability, quality of crying, and presence or absence of tears with crying). Travel history and recent antibiotic use are other important points in the history that may suggest the possibility of traveler\u2019s diarrhea or C. difficile infection [31, 33].",

Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend using a simple dehydration scale to classify the total body water loss occurring with dehydration as minimal/none (<3 %), mild/moderate (3\u20139 %), or severe (>10 %). Abnormal capillary refill (>2 s), decreased skin turgor, and abnormal respiratory pattern (hyperpnea) have been the most reliable signs of determining the severity of dehydration. The vast majority of children presenting with acute gastroenteritis do not require serum or urine tests, as they are unlikely to be helpful in determining the degree of dehydration. Laboratory values may be helpful in evaluating severe dehydration, for which intravenous fluids and electrolyte supplementation (especially potassium, bicarbonate, and sodium) are needed [31, 34]. Prevention of dehydration is the cornerstone of gastroenteritis treatment in children. A child with minimal or no dehydration should be encouraged to continue his or her usual diet plus drink adequate fluids. Early oral rehydration therapy using an oral rehydration solution (ORS), before the child becomes more severely dehydrated, is important and can be done at home.5 The best way to accomplish early treatment is to train the physician\u2019s office staff to explain how to use an ORS when caregivers call for help at the beginning of a child\u2019s illness. Clear liquids, such as water, sodas, chicken broth, and apple juice, should not replace an ORS because they are hyperosmolar and do not adequately replace potassium, bicarbonate, and sodium. These fluids, especially water and apple juice, can cause hyponatremia. An ORS is composed of sodium, dextrose, and bicarbonate in a ratio that does not overwhelm the hyperactive bowel with a hyperosmolar solution, but that replaces the electrolyte loss. In general, antidiarrheal medications should not be used in children with acute gastroenteritis because they delay the elimination of infectious agents from the gastrointestinal tract.",

Identifying pinworm can be done by finding the female worm, which is about 10 mm long, in the perianal region 1 or 2 h after a child goes to bed at night, or by using a low-power microscope to identify ova on cellophane tape. The ova are obtained in the early morning before the child arises by patting the perianal skinfolds with a strip of cellophane tape, which is then placed sticky side down on a glass slide and viewed microscopically. This procedure should be repeated on five successive mornings; if necessary, eggs may also be identified by examining scrapings from underneath the patient\u2019s nails.",

A single dose of any of these medications is given followed by another single dose 2 weeks later. The medications do not reliably kill pinworm eggs. Therefore, the second dose is to prevent re-infection by adult worms that hatch from any eggs that are not killed by the first treatment. Repeated infections should be treated by the same method as the first infection. In households where more than one member is infected or where repeated, symptomatic infections occur; it is recommended that all household members be treated at the same time. In institutions, mass and simultaneous treatment, repeated in 2 weeks, can be effective. Handwashing after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before handling food is the most successful way to prevent pinworm infection. In order to help prevent the spread of pinworm and possible re-infection, people who are infected should bathe every morning to help remove many of the eggs on the skin. Showering is a better method than taking a bath, because showering avoids potentially contaminating the bath water with pinworm eggs. Infected people should not co-bathe with others. Infected patients also must cut their fingernails regularly and avoid biting the nails and scratching around the anus. Frequent changing of underclothes and bed linens first thing in the morning is a great way to prevent possible transmission of eggs in the environment and risk of reinfection. These items should not be shaken and carefully placed into a washer and laundered in hot water followed by a hot dryer to kill any eggs that may be present [36, 37].\n",
