It is therefore of clinical importance to identify groups at high risk of progression to lower respiratory tract infection and death, among patients with hematologic malignancy with or without HCT. Furthermore, since the heterogeneity of an individual patient\u2019s risk might contribute to the mixed results of the efficacy of ribavirin, stratification of such patients by risk could reveal subgroups of patients who might benefit the most from antiviral therapy. However, limited data and tools are available for risk stratification of such patients. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop a risk prediction model and analyze the efficacy of ribavirin in each risk group.",

In the present study, oral ribavirin did not significantly reduce PIV-associated mortality in any risk group regardless of dosage. This finding is consistent with our previous study using propensity score matching to offset selection bias, which revealed that in hematologic malignancy patients with paramyxovirus infection, ribavirin was not associated with better outcomes [13]. Interestingly, more patients died in the ribavirin group in the moderate risk group at doses of under 15 mg/kg and over 20 mg/kg. The reason for these counterintuitive findings is unclear.

In addition, some may argue that the heterogenous population including both HCT recipients and non-HCT patients with hematologic malignancy could result in missed analysis for the effect on infection severity of other potential factors.

To offset such a statistical bias, the final model includes previously established risk factors, and points were assigned using risk factor coefficients, not hazard ratios. Finally, although the prediction model in the present study showed good performance, the possibility of overfitting cannot be ruled out since it was not validated using an external cohort. To ensure the generalizability of the model, external validation using a larger cohort is required.",
