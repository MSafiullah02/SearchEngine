HIV disproportionately impacts women [7] and is often concentrated in socially marginalized and disenfranchised communities [8]. COVID-19 is affecting women disproportionately; they are \u201cessential workers\" taking the strain as food service industry workers, janitors, cashiers, and stockers. Many live in densely populated areas that have no proper sanitation [7]. The social distancing and lockdown measures have impacted nearly 81% of the world\u2019s labor force, mostly women [7]. According to the World Bank, almost 24 million fewer people will escape poverty in East Asia and the Pacific because of the financial impact of COVID-19 in 2020 [9]. Already half of the world population cannot access healthcare services, and large numbers of households are poor because of healthcare costs [9]. The emergence of COVID-19 may widen the gender inequality gap to an unprecedented level and threaten women\u2019s health. For example, many HIV infected women will lack the essential antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs, or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreP) because of disruptions in the supply chain. As a consequence, many will develop an unsuppressed or uncontrolled viral load that will weaken the immune system making them susceptible to COVID-19 [10].",

One in every five people in Africa, nearly 250 million, did not have enough food before the COVID-19 outbreak [12]. The long-term consequences are unknown; however, micronutrient deficiency and anemia are likely, which will worsen HIV/AIDS disease for HIV patients. Women are the caregivers and service providers who are 2.5 times more likely to do unpaid domestic work than men [13]. However, COVID-19 responses have not been poverty or gender-sensitive to the needs of women [14, 15]. In LMICs, women are the frontline workers, community health workers, and community engagement personnel; they are easily susceptible to COVID-19 infections. Without proper personal protective equipment (PPE), and as they work in environments with no water or sanitation, many of these workers could be exposed to COVID-19 outbreaks [16]. Although recommendations and obligatory hand hygiene have been emphasized as requisite to avoid COVID-19 [16], these recommendations are impervious to the social environments of the poor. Millions of people in the world have no access to clean water or soap; asking them to wash their hands to prevent infections is insensitive to the plight of the poor. Such recommendation parallel those made during the early days of HIV pertaining to safe sex practices. However, many populations could not afford condoms, and adequate guarantees were not put in place to acquire them [17].",

Among the LMICs in sub-Saharan Africa, COVID-19 could push these countries farther into a spiral of poverty, ravaging their already tenuous health systems [2, 5]. The vast global demand for PPEs, for example, exerts substantial competition and demand for them. There is a troubling rich/poor divide, disadvantaging many LMICs who lose out to the wealthier countries that outspend and outbid them, sometimes tripling the market price for PPEs [19]. Faced with such inequity gaps, many countries in Latin America and Africa are realizing unseen pre-existing inequities and cannot find enough materials and equipment to test for COVID-19 and treat their populations [7]. The long-term impact on GDP, growth, and service delivery will be consequential as projections have already been revised downwards for most regions and countries [9]",

Evidence awash indicating that providing contraception to women is one of the simplest ways to reduce poverty [21]. During the HIV outbreak, a significant limited reproductive health care and family planning services were available to women. Resources to address the disease were diverted elsewhere [6]. In the era of COVID- 19, disruptions in the manufacture and distribution of critical contraceptives might contribute to unwanted pregnancies [22] and sexually transmitted diseases like HIV. According to the United Nations, an unrelated crisis impacting women worldwide are the spikes in domestic violence due to COVID-19 lockdowns [7]. Lockdowns and mandatory sheltering-in-place may be making violence in homes more frequent and severe as girls and women shelter in place with their abusers. Domestic violence and sexual abuse are significant correlates of HIV risk for women as violence has been identified as an independent risk factor for HIV infection [23]. Women who are abused may not ask their partner to use a condom, nor have the efficacy to say no to sex if their abusive partner does not want to use protection, which will put abused women at a higher risk for HIV. Additionally, women who are transgender and are living with HIV are disproportionately impacted by intimate partner violence [24], stay at home COVID-19 orders could exacerbate their wellbeing.",
