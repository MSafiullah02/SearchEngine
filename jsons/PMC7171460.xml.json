However, there is no \u2019ideal\u2019 fabric that will provide protection against all hazards. Careful selection of appropriate textiles is crucial for the performance, use, care, and maintenance of protective clothing. Broadly, a clear understanding of the work environment and performance requirements as well as knowledge of the textiles, is essential for the decision making process. According to the OSHA Technical Manual, \u2019In general, the greater the level of chemical protective clothing, the greater the associated risks. For any given situation, equipment and clothing should be selected that provide an adequate level of protection. Overprotection as well as under-protection can be hazardous and should be avoided\u2019.1\n",

Heat, physical and psychological stress, as well as reduced dexterity and mobility, are examples of additional hazards that may be a result of the use of protective clothing. In addition to protection, the selection of textiles takes into consideration factors such as the impact of protective clothing on job performance; comfort; durability; availability and cost; use, care, and maintenance, and cultural factors. To select protective clothing materials, relevant factors have to be identified and prioritized in a multi-step process. It is imperative that such a holistic approach be taken while selecting materials for protective clothing. Basing the decision on just the performance properties of the material may result in low user acceptance. For example, a glove that protects a surgeon may be rejected if it hinders the surgeon's ability to operate effectively.",

They are commonly identified by the common name, the Chemical Abstract Registry Service (CAS) number, and the chemical class to which they belong. The CAS numbers are numerical unique identifiers assigned to each substance. Chemicals from the same class, in general, have similar chemical composition. Thus, some commonly used chemicals from the various classes are used to determine the performance of materials against a broad range of chemicals. In cases such as pesticides where mixtures are used, it is recommended that the performance be measured against a representative mixture, rather than determining the performance based on a broad range of chemicals. The chemicals have different physical forms \u2013 solids, liquids, aerosols, and gases. The tests used to determine the performance are often determined by the physical form and the severity of the hazard. Additional information is included in section 4.4.1.",

Cut injuries occur in work environments where individuals work with sharp, high-speed objects such as chainsaws. In most cases, resistant materials are used to protect the hands and legs. Ballistic protection is required to protect individuals from bullets. Bullets may also cause blunt trauma injury by deforming the body armor. Thus, body armor designed to protect individuals is evaluated for ballistic protection as well as the ability to prevent blunt trauma injury. Puncture or stab resistance is required to protect individuals from sharp objects such as knives, as well as comparatively blunt objects commonly used by inmates in correctional facilities. In addition to the above mentioned hazards, protection against abrasion is also used as a criterion for selecting the material. Protection against multiple physical hazards is commonly required for individuals in the military, police force or correctional institutions. Body armor is commonly used to provide protection against physical hazards. Puncture resistance tests are conducted on numerous fabrics that provide protection from hazards such as radiological and biological protection, as the individuals may be exposed to other hazards, if the material is punctured by a sharp object.\n",

For example, body armor classification developed by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) is used for the selection of the body armor based on the potential workplace hazard. European Union certification for PPE uses Type I-VI categories that are based on very broad hazard scenarios. Although there are ratings or classifications for the various types of hazards, there is no universal system to rate the severity of all hazards. In the future, there may be a system to assess the severity and rate it regardless of the type of hazard. For example, the extremely hazardous category may be defined to include all hazard scenarios that are life threatening in very small amounts. Thus, the extremely hazardous category may include SARS and anthrax from the biological category, nerve gas from chemical, ballistic from physical, and radioactive materials from radiological hazards. This type of rating would help in the testing and selection of PPE materials. For example, when the severity of hazard is extreme, stringent rules would apply for the handling and testing of fabric, and thorough testing of the whole garment ensemble would be necessary.",

For example, face masks or respirators with different filters are used to protect individuals against exposure due to inhalation. Chemical protective clothing is used to protect against dermal exposure. Chemical protective clothing materials are broadly divided into woven; nonwoven; laminated to microporous or hydrophilic membranes; coated, bonded, or laminated with plastic films or rubber; and films, sheets, or moulded plastic or rubber. The performance of the chemical protective materials varies considerably based on the air permeability, chemical composition, and material characteristics. Penetration, permeation, and/or degradation of the materials are measured to determine the chemical resistance. In general, the physical form of the chemical that poses a potential risk and the type of material determine whether penetration, permeation, and/or degradation tests have to be conducted. Permeation is \u2019the process by which a chemical moves through a protective clothing material on a molecular level. Permeation involves (i) sorption of molecules of the chemical into the contacted (challenge side) surface of the material; (ii) diffusion of the sorbed molecules in the material, and (iii) desorption of the molecules from the opposite surface of the material\u2019.15\n",

The color codes and corresponding breakthrough times used in the guidelines are green for breakthrough detection time of >4 hours of continuous contact (a >8 is used when the breakthrough is greater than eight hours); yellow with breakthrough detection time between 1\u20134 hours; red with breakthrough times of less than one hour. White is used when no data is available for the material. Testing the material against the challenge liquid is recommended prior to use. Contact between the material and the chemical may result in degradation of the material or the breakthrough may be a result of the degradation of the material. It is important to note that the data reported in the guidelines is a compilation of published and unpublished permeation test data obtained from various sources. The authors of the publication state that at least 90% of the tests were conducted using ASTM F739-99, Standard Test Method for Resistance of Protective Clothing Materials to Permeation by Liquids or Gases Under Conditions of Continuous Contact.15 The majority of the data for generic materials is a summary of results from different sources. According to the OSHA technical manual, \u2019The major limitation for these guidelines are their presentation of recommendations by generic material class. Numerous test results have shown that similar materials from different manufacturers may give widely different performance. That is to say manufacturer A's butyl rubber glove may protect against chemical X, but a butyl glove made by manufacturer B may not'.1\n",

A number of departments desiring more than minimum protection wear type II-A armor, which has been found sufficiently comfortable for full-time wear where the threat warrants it, particularly for those departments that use lower velocity 357 Magnum service weapons. Type II armor, heavier and more bulky than type II-A, is worn full time by some departments, but may not be considered suitable for full-time use in hot, humid climates. Type III-A armor, which provided the highest level of protection available as soft body armor, is generally considered to be unsuitable for routine wear, however, individuals confronted with a terrorist threat may be willing to tolerate the weight and bulk of such armor while on duty.

On the other hand, the cleaning cost of reusable garments may justify the use of limited-use garments.",

The material should be able to withstand the normal wear and tear expected for the job that is being performed. Physical characteristics that are commonly measured and reported for protective clothing materials are tensile strength, tearing strength, bursting strength, abrasion resistance, puncture resistance, and cut resistance. In addition fabric weight, flexibility, flammability, and degradation due to environmental conditions may also be measured. Often the performance specifications include minimum requirements for limited use and reusable materials. For materials in which a finish is applied to provide protection, determination of the durability of the finish is very important. The protective properties and thus the wear life of these materials may be reduced.",

Thus, it is difficult to develop protective clothing materials that are accepted globally. It is also important for the individual responsible for making decisions to have an understanding of the culture. Decisions made by individuals solely on performance specifications have resulted in non-compliance due to low user acceptance of the recommended PPE for cultural reasons. User acceptance of protective clothing worn by pesticide applicators is used as an example of how factors such as color and materials can be important in the selection of protective clothing. A report published on the Safe Use project in Kenya explains:20\nPersuading farmers to use protective clothing was one of the biggest challenges. They see it as uncomfortable and expensive. Locally designed and manufactured clothing is addressing these problems. More specifically, women in Africa have a cultural aversion to being seen in trousers. Kenyan women were therefore asked to design their own protective clothing and the results have been widely publicised.\n",
