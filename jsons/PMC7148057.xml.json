Most knowledge bases only capture a binary relationship between diseases and symptoms, neglecting the degree of the importance between a symptoms and a disease. For example, abdominal pain and nausea are both symptoms of an appendicitis, but while abdominal pain is a key differentiating factor, nausea does only little to distinguish appendicitis from other diseases of the digestive system. While several disease-symptom extraction methods have been proposed that retrieve a ranked list of symptoms for a disease [7, 10, 13, 14], no collection is available to systematically evaluate the performance of such methods [11]. While these method are extensively used in downstream tasks, e.g., to increase the accuracy of computer-assisted medical diagnosis [9], their effectiveness for disease-symptom extraction remains unclear.",

A commonly used resource for the extraction of disease-symptom relations are the articles of the PubMed database. PubMed contains more than 30 million biomedical articles, including the abstract, title, and various meta-data. Previous work [3, 7] uses the abstracts of the PubMed articles together with rule-based approaches. In particular, Hassan et al. [3] derive patterns of disease-symptom relations from dependency graphs, followed by the automatic selection of the best patterns based on proposed selection criteria. Martin et al. [7] generate extraction rules automatically, which are then inspected for their viability by medical experts. Xia et al. [13] design special queries that include the name and synonyms of each disease and symptom. They use these queries to return the relevant articles, and use the number of retrieved results to perform a ranking via Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI).",
