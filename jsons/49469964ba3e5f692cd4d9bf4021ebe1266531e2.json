The study emphasises the significant role of the cardiac system in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. However, since many of the patients included in the   3   analysis are still being observed and have not reached clinical end points, and since   electrocardiography and echocardiography data as well as cytokine level measurements were   not collected, the exact contribution of COVID-19 towards the elevated lab values and poor prognosis cannot be identified with certainity. 3 In another retrospective cohort study of 191 adult patients (median age 56 years; 62% male) in Wuhan, China, cardiac involvement was likewise evident. Of the nonsurvivors (54 patients), 59% had acute cardiac injury, 50% had coagulopathy, and 52% heart failure. Interestingly, the median time from illness onset to acute cardiac injury among nonsurvivors was 14.5 days, compared to only one incidence of acute cardiac injury in survivors, which took place 21 days post-illness onset. Non-survivors had higher levels of d-dimer, hs-cTnI, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin 6 (IL6), with increasing levels as illness deteriorated. Hs-cTnI levels increased rapidly from day 16 after disease onset, whereas LDH increased for both survivors and non-survivors in the early stages of progression, but decreased from day 13 for survivors. Elevated blood levels of IL-6, hs-cTnI, and LDH, as well as lymphopenia were more commonly seen in cases of severe COVID-19. 2 Most recently, a retrospective case-series of 187 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China (mean age 58.5 years) found that around 35% of patients had underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD), including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy. 28% of patients exhibited myocardial injury. Mortality during hospitalization was around 8% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, and around 69% (25 of 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnT levels. Another interesting finding in this study is that patients without underlying CVD but elevated TnT level had a mortality rate of 37.5% which was significantly higher than in those with underlying CVD, but normal TnT (13.3%). Unlike the other studies that reported TnI only, this study found that the plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization on one hand, and impending death on the 4 other, increased significantly compared with admission values in patients who died, while no significant dynamic changes of TnT and NT-proBNP were observed in survivors.",

In order to improve its utility as a marker in detecting true positives, the high sensitivity cTnI assay was developed, allowing for wider screening and consequent detection and reversal of cardiac injury at the very early stages (albeit with a higher false positive rate for acute myocardial infarction",

These findings thus lead to questioning of the mechanisms behind the 5 elevated troponin levels that have evidently been associated with not only disease severity, but mortality.",

Thus, it is only reasonable that indicators of cardiac injury are involved in patient diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis, while recognizing that their abnormality may not be related to a direct coronary process. In fact, patients with markers of cardiac injury were at a higher risk of death both during the time from symptom onset and from admission to end point, 3 suggesting that related biomarkers such as hs-cTnI can provide prognostic information early on and throughout disease progression. Levels of troponin reported in the studies were also significantly associated with other inflammatory markers and morbidities, and were dynamically changing with worsening outcomes, which was not the case in survivors. 4 It is important to mention that unrelated to COVID-19, it has been shown in large cohort studies (n=250,000) that a positive troponin result, even if slightly above normal, is associated with a clinically important increased mortality, regardless of age or acute coronary syndrome diagnosis. In other words, troponin levels have always been a marker of worse prognosis in critically ill patients. 10 In summary, there are several mechanisms that could be at play to explain myocardial injury in relation to COVID-19 infection, that include but are not limited to: Myocarditis, sepsis and associated systemic inflammatory response, pro-coagulant condition, destabilization of coronary plaque, and hypoxia.",

            "text": "and Guo et al's (2020) 4 studies, and modelled mortality as a function of the full factorial model [died = intercept + high/normal + cTnT/hs-cTnI + interaction (high/normal, cTnT/hs-cTnI)]. No significant difference was found between the predictive abilities of hs-cTnI (used by Shi et al) and cTnT (used by Guo et al). Patients with elevated hs-cTnI had a 51.2% probability of death (CI: 40.5%-61.8%) compared to 4.5% (CI: 2.7%-7.3%) in patients with normal values. Likewise, patients with elevated TnT (more specific), had a 59.6% (CI: 45.9%-72.0%) mortality estimate compared to 8.9% (CI: 5.1%-15.0%) in patients with normal TnT values.As shown from the previous three cohort studies, troponin levels were increased with a myriad of biomarkers, including those associated more generally with inflammation (e.g.IL6). 2,3 Contributory mechanisms can hence include a systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine storm as mediated by the immune system's direct response to the virus, or as related to the exacerbated inflammatory activity within coronary atherosclerotic plaques rupturing in response to local inflammation. On the other hand, the elevated levels of d-dimers and incidence of coagulopathy amongst COVID-19 patients points towards a procoagulant state and general hemodynamic changes which may predispose to ischaemia and thrombosis, 2.3 leading to cardiac injury. The elevated d-dimers were additionally accompanied by elevated fibrinogen levels in some cases, which is atypical of the pathogenomic of acute disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) seen in critically ill individuals. It is possible that this may be triggered by lipoprotein(a), a low-density lipoprotein associated with both CVD and thrombosis, in response to the elevation in IL-6 6 levels as part of the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 patients. Findings from an autopsy indicated an MI, 2 while electrocardiographs performed during the period of elevated cardiac biomarkers all showed abnormal findings compatible with myocardial ischemia (Twave depression and inversion, ST-segment depression, and Q-waves). 3 Additionally, the observed large number of cardiovascular events (e.g. arrhythmia and heart failure) in nonsurviving patients can be interpreted in-line with findings of stress cardiomyopathy. The observed cardiac injury may also be a result of type two MI, secondary to ischemia triggered by an increase in demand and decrease in supply caused by the severe respiratory illness. On the other hand, considering the ACE2-related pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and the receptors expression in myocytes, 2 it is possible, theoretically, that the virus's direct impact on the cells can lead to infectious myocarditis and apoptosis-induced cellular damage. 3Nonetheless, since interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates were documented in heart tissue of fatal COVID-19 cases, while viral detection has not yet been reported,8 indirect inflammatory mechanisms are more likely related to the cardiac complications associated with COVID-19. Ongoing registries to collect cardiovascular data in COVID-19 patients, such as CAPACITY-COVID, will help better our understanding of the disease's implications.",

            "text": "Consider screening COVID-19 positive patients using high sensitivity troponin in order to triage them into high and low risk groups.4. In admitted symptomatic patients, consider monitoring troponin daily when elevated. If not elevated, levels can be monitored longitudinally at different8 intervals, to predict potential worsening in disease course. Since the studies referenced above reported minimal elevation of troponin levels in surviving patients, use of hs-cTnI assays can provide a highly sensitive test to potentially rule out severe complications and a poor prognosis early on, and may prove useful in last-resort and limited-resource situations that demand triaging of COVID-19 patients. 5. Similar to non-pandemic situations, troponin levels should not be used in isolation as an indicator of MI or for activation of systems of care, as such elevation can be related to non-coronary mechanisms. Troponin values should be used in the context of clinical signs and symptoms, ECGs, chest x-rays, echocardiogram and other clinical and laboratory investigations. 6. The reported prevalence of coagulopathy in COVID-19, that seems to differ from other coagulopathies (such as DIC) present in critically ill patients, invites consideration for the use of anticoagulants in the management of patients with elevated biomarkers indicative of thromboembolic processes, though prospective trials are needed.",
