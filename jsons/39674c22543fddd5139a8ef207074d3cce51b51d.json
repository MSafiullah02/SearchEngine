Case 4 misses RT-PCR, while chest CT has not been done for case 2. This is a limitation for this early case series that will need to be explored in future perioperative protocols globally [6] . Also, it will be important to take into consideration that some inflammatory parameters such as CRP, white blood cell count, and liver function alterations, as well as pulmonary pneumonia or thromboembolism and collapsed lung, can also be seen in patients presenting with bariatric surgery complications. Therefore, it is important to do a complete differential diagnosis in those patients failing after gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy and to include COVID-19 as one more possibility.",
