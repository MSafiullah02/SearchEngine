Lower respiratory tract infections particularly contribute to the world's disease burden [Dominguez et al., 2009]. Except for Influenza virus and Respiratory Syncytial virus, mostly viral aetiology of AVRI remains undiagnosed. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have a history way back in the late 1960s, identified as a group of viruses with potential to infect humans and animals [Principi et al., 2010]. Six human coronaviruses have been identified till date, which are HCoV\u2010229E, HCoV\u2010HKU1, HCoV\u2010NL63, HCoV\u2010OC43, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and the recent Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV). Four human coronaviruses HCoV\u2010229E, HCoV\u2010HKU1, HCoV\u2010NL63, and HCoV\u2010OC43 have been found to be associated with a wide range of respiratory symptoms, including fatal outcomes such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Specifically, HCoV\u2010NL63 has been associated with croup [Abdul\u2010Rasool and Fielding, 2010] and HCoV\u2010HKU1 with febrile convulsion [Gaunt et al., 2010].",

But these studies included all respiratory infections and were not limited to SARI cases. While majority of HCoVs are associated with mild acute respiratory infection and our samples included only SARI cases, this could be the possible reason for the observed low prevalence of HCoVs in this study. Further, tropical climate in Southwest India also may have contributed to the low prevalence.",
