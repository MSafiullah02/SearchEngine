The data were re-arranged and cleaned, and data including few records were excluded, for example, the records of HBV loading was less than 6. Finally, 220 features were included. The clinical features were compared, by dividing into the samples into non-severe/critical and severe/critical groups. Student t-test and Wilcox rank test were used, and for features with p values <0.01 in both algorithms was considered to be significantly associated with severe/critical symptom. Totally, 36 clinical and laboratory features were significantly associated with severe/critical cases, Fig. 1\n. These were mainly immune features (including CD3, CD4, CD19, CRP, super-sensitive CRP, leukomonocytes and neutrophils), thyroxine products (including triiodothyronine, free triiodothyronine, thyroxine and free thyroxine), and electrolyte balance (Na+, Cl-). Considering that severe/critical symptom was detected when 10 out of these 26 patients reached the hospital, these features may reflect the character of severe/critical cases, instead of the sign. In other word, these features may be used for diagnosis instead of prediction. Thus, the severe/critical samples were further divided into two groups, one group did not show severe/critical symptom when collecting samples while the other did. Statistical difference of these 33 features were re-analyzed. Interestingly, none of these features were statistically different between the groups (Table S1). This may imply that the various immune cells have participate in the severe/critical disease, and laboratory features have been exhibited before the severe/critical symptom onset.",

In this study, clinical and laboratory features were analyzed and 36 of them were found to be statistically significantly associated with the clinical outcome (severe/critical symptom) of these patients infected COVID-19. It is interesting that despite some patients (10 out of 26) were observed severe/critical symptom while the others (16 out of 26) were mild when underwent clinical and laboratory examinations, the features of all these cases were similar. It is also noticed that the features include dysfunction of immune cells and immune products, including CD3, CD4, CD19, CRP, high-sensitive CRP, leukomonocytes and neutrophils. In consistent with this, previous study claimed that severe cases have significantly more leukocytes count and CRP [6]. In combination of these clues, we suspect that the acute immune response has been start several days before severe/critical symptom begins.",

A new study revealed that one demographic and six serological indicators (age, serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen, albumin, direct bilirubin were associated with severe symptoms, which is consistent with our study [12]. The model developed has sensitivity of 77.5 % and specificity of 78.4% in the validation cohort. Since the laboratory indicators of this study is limited, the sensitivity and specificity are not satisfactory. Another study collected data from 133 patients with mild symptom in Wuhan, and used multivariate logistic regression for predicting the patients who will developed into severe symptom using AI, and the best AUC achieved was 0.954. However, the sample number is the major concern [13].
