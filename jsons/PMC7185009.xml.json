We commend Dr. Vonderhaar's team for adding Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) to their primary care services. We are also providers at a Federally Qualified Health Center and would like to offer an alternative view of MAT treatment initiation from the perspective of a clinic with a well-established MAT practice. While every MAT practice can experience the occasional bump in the road, we would not want Dr. Vonderhaar\u2019s experience to act as a deterrent to any NPs considering adding this vital service. As the current COVID-19 epidemic continues to unfold, we are already seeing an increase in the need for mental health and social services of all types and anticipate this will extend to MAT.",

We are fortunate to have support from a MAT nurse, a psychiatric mental health NP, a licensed clinical social worker, and other care coordination staff, and to have developed a clinic culture that treats MAT no differently than any other chronic disease.",

Patients in sustained or more stable recovery can be seen in an office-based outpatient (OBOT) setting such as the one offered by our clinic. A statewide learning collaborative brings providers, mental health clinicians, nurses and others together to learn and review cases (Nordtrom et al., 2016).",

This allows us to be clear about what we can reasonably manage within our outpatient setting. Many of our MAT patients are already seen for primary care services, and it is a requirement of our clinic that any patient who wishes to be seen for MAT services also enroll for primary care. Some of our primary care patients are also seen at a hub for their MAT prescriptions, with the goal of eventually transferring all of their care to our office. We do occasionally see patients for a direct induction with suboxone \u2013 often these are patients who are long-standing primary care clients, are already known to us, and are considered stable enough for outpatient treatment. A patient such as the one described by Dr. Vonderhaar would usually be referred to the hub for IOP service with daily visits.",

When a patient is discharged from the hospital with medical issues such as congestive heart failure, a recent myocardial infarction, poorly controlled diabetes, or worsening chronic kidney disease we work to prioritize their care. We consider housing, food insecurity, and access to home health if needed. We take it one step at a time, tap into our resources, and bring them back for frequent visits.
