However, questions tend to be lengthy and laborious to understand because they often contain peripheral information. Question summarization is the task of transforming such questions into shorter and concise ones. We focus on the setting used in existing studies that transforms an input question into a concise single-sentence summary [7, 12, 21]. This setting can be regarded as title or headline generation, and is particularly important for practical application on CQA sites where questions do not always have appropriate titles, unlike news articles. In fact, to reduce the burden on users who post questions, many CQA sites (including the biggest Japanese CQA site, Yahoo! Chiebukuro [23]), do not provide an input field for titles in the submission form to reduce the burden on users who post questions.On most CQA sites, the first sentence of a question is displayed as the headline, but this is not always appropriate. We show these examples in Table 1.",

The extractive approach has an advantage in that it does not generate errors when extracting one sentence for title generation and can be directly used for real services, as reported by Higurashi et al. [7]. Therefore, we take the extractive approach assuming that extracted titles will be used for a real service.\n",

Distant supervision [17] involves training a model on pseudo data automatically labeled on the basis of heuristics, rules, and/or external resources. Various approaches for different tasks have been proposed, such as the use of FreeBase [1] for relation extraction, emoticons for sentiment classification [6], and topic labels on Wikipedia articles for blog topic classification [10]. In the summarization field, Nallapati et al. [18] and Chen and Lapata [3] automatically annotated labels for sentence extraction by using a dataset with human-generated abstractive summaries. However, we face difficulties in directly applying their strategies due to the lack of human-generated abstractive summaries (or titles).",

In contrast, 91.2% of 315 sentences randomly selected from long multi-sentence posts consisting of more than ten sentences were not self-contained questions. In fact, they are often not even a question, which makes them more similar to sentences not to be included in a summary than to titles. Our main finding here is that single-sentence questions on CQA sites are mostly self-contained, which makes them similar to sentences used as a title. Note that small amounts of noise or incorrect labels can be ignored, as shown in later in the experimental results (Sect. 3).",

Chiebukuro are single-sentence questions. For negative instances, only a few long multi-sentence questions exist, but the number of sentences in the questions is large. In Step 2, we can use any classifier even with a large number of parameters thanks to the availability of large-scale data. In our experiments, we examine neural network and logistic regression classifiers. In Step 3, we prepare three selection strategies: Greedy, Init, and Q. Greedy selects the sentence with the highest confidence score, whereas Init selects the initial sentence among sentences with reasonably high confidence scores, which is expected to be effective for multi-focused questions. Q first extracts question sentences by means of a rule-based approach and then selects the sentence with the highest score among the extracted question sentences. We will explain these steps (i.e., how to create the pseudo data, the training settings of the classifiers, and the algorithms for the selection strategies) in more detail in the next section.",
