And we have struggled long and hard to win this right. However, during this pandemic, a support person/partner at labor and birth in a hospital setting increases the risk of illness or death for midwives, mothers, babies, all hospital staff, and the families and communities of all involved. Now is the time for ultimate sacrifice in order to decrease the suffering of masses of human beings. For those of us who survive we will have the luxury to deal with the mental health effects of such isolation. Just as post-war survivors do.",

Life is now about saving as many lives as possible. As of today, women in NYC are fortunate to continue to have qualified health care providers at labor and birth in hospitals: midwives, residents, attendings, anesthesia, pediatricians, RNs, and PAs. Our patients are not alone. We each know stories of heroic women who have labored without loved ones physically nearby both today and throughout human history: women who are enslaved, women who live in shelters, women survivors of violence, women geographically displaced, women who live in refugee camps on our borders and around the world, women who undergo famines, women who undergo disease outbreaks such as cholera and Ebola, women who undergo natural disasters. Here is an example of a woman who labored in a NYC hospital several years ago narrated to me by a former student:\"I am pregnant with my first baby, now 27 weeks and a midwife on the Navajo reservation. I recently woke up in the middle of the night as I now normally do. I was breathing fast and had racing thoughts. I began to think about how scared my patients must also feel. But then I thought of a patient of mine from several years ago in NY. She was a Yazidi women from Iraq, a refugee from ISIS, who had just delivered her eighth baby. She had gone into labor on the refugee transport plane, so she had been brought from JFK directly to our hospital. Her family and children had to proceed onto a refugee center in the Midwest. She had delivered alone, in a place where she knew no one, and could not easily communicate. I couldn't imagine her situation and asked her through the translator phone: \"This must be so hard for you to be here alone in an unfamiliar place with a brand-new baby.\" She smiled back and responded (paraphrasing here), \"I am not sad - I can't tell you how happy I finally feel. Me and my family have suffered through so much and now I am here in with my healthy baby and we are safe and that is all that matters.\" Thinking of her strength and vigilance calmed me back to sleep. I like to imagine her now resettled maybe somewhere in Ohio reassuring her family that they will continue to be strong and persevere in the face of this current crisis. \"\n",

            "text": "Here are specific suggestions:1Encourage women to \"shelter in place\" in the practice to which they are registered. The reason for this is to decrease systems chaos in labor. If a woman is not registered in a practice or is not known to the practice it is more likely that she will have many more encounters through the ED and possibly more people exposed and infected.2Be clear and honest with your patients. Explain and support the rationale for no partner/support person at birth. Also let the woman know that babies may be placed in the nursery and not at bedside for the same reasons of protecting and maintaining adequate numbers of healthy staff. Hands on breastfeeding support should be limited. Nothing is known about the safety of breastfeeding. Hopefully each hospital will exercise 24-hour postpartum discharge when possible.3Practice belief in the women you serve. You are serving them heroically by working. Mentor them and guide them to know that they have the requisite strength within. Support and love can be accessed without physical presence.\n",
