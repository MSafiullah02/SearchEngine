The disease associations for the closely related bocaviruses HBoV2-4 remain unknown. Increasing evidence shows that probiotics may reduce the risk of AOM of viral origin. Objectives of the study was to examine the prevalence and persistence of bocaviruses in consecutive nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) of otitis-prone children, and whether an association exists between HBoV and the child's characteristics, respiratory symptoms, and AOM pathogens, and whether probiotics reduce the occurrence of HBoV. Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 6-month intervention study, 269 otitisprone children (aged 9 months to 5.6 years), consumed daily either one capsule of probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, Bifidobacterium breve 99 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii JS) or placebo. After a clinical examination and NPS collected at three-time points, the presence and persistence of HBoV1-4 DNA in NPS was determined by RT-qPCR at the baseline, after 3, and 6 months. Results: A high load (>10,000 copies/ml) of HBoV DNA was detected in 26 (17.1%) of 152 children, and 16 (10.5%) showed a prolonged presence of HBoV for at least 3 months. None had DNA of HBoV2-4. Higher number of siblings associated with increased HBoV prevalence (p = 0.029). Prevalence or persistence of HBoV was not significantly associated with other characteristics, respiratory symptoms, or AOM pathogens. Probiotic intervention significantly reduced the number of HBoV DNA-positive samples (probiotic vs. placebo: 6.4% vs. 19 .0%, OR = 0.25, CI 95% = 0.07-0.94, p = 0.039).

Serological testing, coupled with qPCR, could aid in study of trustworthy causal associations between HBoV and respiratory disease [27, 34, 48] In line with this, we confirmed that presence of HBoV DNA in NPS, even at high viral loads, did not associate significantly with respiratory symptoms reported 2 weeks before or after any scheduled sample-collection periods.

In particular, the probiotic strain L. rhamnosus GG has been effective in prevention of children's upper respiratory tract infections [30, 31] . Interestingly, we found that probiotic treatment reduced significantly the number of HBoV DNA-positive samples (p = 0.039) in 3-6 months after intervention, and marginally also the amount of HBoVpositive children.
