We estimated the relative risks of death and severe disease among MERS-CoV patients in the Middle East between 2012 and 2015 for several risk factors, using Poisson regression with robust variance and a bootstrap-based expectation maximization algorithm to handle extensive missing data. Increased age and underlying comorbidity were risk factors for both death and severe disease, while cases arising in Saudi Arabia were more likely to be severe. Cases occurring later in the emergence of MERS-CoV and among health-care workers were less serious.

We have attempted to address this for MERS-CoV, using a regularly updated, publicly available data set. The use of multivariate models with allowance for extensively missing data has allowed the identification of some previously suggested risk factors that do not appear to be so upon adjustment for other covariates.

While not a surprising finding, this does suggest that older and sicker patients merit heightened vigilance. Additionally, cases arising progressively later during the epidemic have been associated with lower risks of both death and severe disease at the time of initial reporting, suggesting that treatment methods for MERS-CoV may be increasing in efficacy. Alternately, the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases has been rising over time, suggesting that less severe cases are becoming more likely to be ascertained as a result of epidemiologic investigation. This is supported by temporal trends in the missingness of the data, which grows less severe later in the epidemic.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "This study was not without limitations, especially those stemming from the data used.
