Integrated optical sensors 16 , especially the interferometric ones that have been developed in recent years, such as the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) 17 and the Young interferometer [18] [19] [20] [21] , show an extremely high refractive index resolution in the range of 10 \u00c07 \u00c010 \u00c08 RIU (refractive index units) 17, 21 , which is equivalent to detection of a protein mass coverage of $30 fg/mm 2 . Furthermore, the IO readout systems are robust and small, allowing for miniaturization where many elements of the device can be integrated in a single chip occupying a relatively small area. These features offer the prospect for development of multisensing systems. Furthermore, this implies an increase of the analysis throughput, a reduction in the consumption of biomaterials, and cost reduction. Moreover, the optical-based sensors are label free sensing techniques, which require less complex sample preparation, do not need special laboratories and skilled personnel, and result in lower test costs. An additional advantage is that usually a simpler and faster signal analysis can be achieved.",

In Fig. 10 .2, a schematic layout of a two-channel IO YI is shown. Light is coupled into an IO channel waveguide and split by a Y-junction to two parallel output channels positioned at a certain distance from each other, as shown in Fig. 10. 2. An interference pattern is generated as a result of the overlap of both outgoing divergent beams. The interference pattern is recorded by a CCD camera, which is placed at a given distance from the endface of the integrated chip. A sensing window is realized on the top of the core layer of the measuring channel where the samples to be analyzed are applied. When a binding event takes place on the sensing window of the measuring channel a phase change between reference and measuring channels occurs and the interference pattern will be shifted with respect to the camera surface.

In a channel waveguide structure, schematically shown in Fig. 10 .4, the light is confined not only in the transverse direction, but also in the lateral one. This confinement is caused by the lateral contrast of the (effective) refractive indices between the channel region, N eff-C , and the slab, N eff-S , i.e., N eff-C > N eff-S . This contrast can be established by the presence of a ridge in the core section, where the Total internal reflection in a three-layer waveguide structure. n i (i \u00bc C, F, S) indicates the refractive index of layer i of the waveguide structure, n F > n C,S ; d F is the thickness of the core layer effective refractive index is defined as N eff \u00bc n F siny.

The single mode character is important as different modes are affected differently by refractive index changes due to, e.g., analyte concentration changes. This will strongly complicate the signal analysis. Coupling of the light to the channel waveguide is achieved by very efficient fiber-to-chip coupling 17 , which results in a robust device. Alternative coupling schemes such as end-fire coupling 38 or grating coupling 39 may also be applied. For optimal fiber-to-chip coupling adiabatic transition from the channel waveguide end-face cross-section to the cross-section of the common waveguide requires transverse adiabatic tapers, which have a small taper angle (<0.030) to have functional tapering losses <0.1 dB 40 . The distances between the four channels are chosen such that all six possible distances between a set of two channels are distinct in order to allow independent measurements of phase differences (see discussion in Sect. 10.2.2). Furthermore, the distances are chosen such that (a) a reasonable number (>2) of fringes are visible at the CCD interface (the channels should not be too close) and (b) there is a good overlap of the light from the different channels at the surface of the CCD (the channels should not be too far apart).

The average number of HSA antigen molecules bound per one a-HSA antibody molecule is low ($0.25), see (10.15) , indicating that there may be still antibody molecules available for binding. A larger binding in that case can be achieved by increasing the concentration of HSA antigen solutions, until the saturation level is reached, meaning that nearly all the available binding sites in the a-HSA layer are occupied by antigens.

It should be note, however, that the used antigen concentrations were below the saturation value. The use of higher concentrations of HSA yielded slightly better results (ratio $0.3) indicating that there is still room for improvement. In addition, physical adsorption was used for immobilization of antibodies as an alternative to a pA-modified surface. In that case, postcoating with BSA after antibody adsorption was applied to prevent nonspecific binding of antigen. The results achieved with this method were less effective concerning the antibody immobilization ($1.6 mg/m 2 ) and specificity.

Existing methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 47 , branched-chain DNA (bDNA) tests 48 , and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 49 are very sensitive, but have some major drawbacks. These techniques are very labor-intensive and require time-consuming sample preparation procedures. Therefore these techniques may have limited use for rapid responses in case of serious viral outbreaks. This drawback has motivated the development of many alternative techniques that may overcome the limitations of the existing methods. Among these, label-free detection schemes such as Raman 50,51 , rupture event scanning 52 , nanowires 53 , microring resonators 10 , and cantilever based techniques 54,55 are among the most promising.

Here we first added serum (with no virus particles present) to the measuring channel, which was followed by adding virus-containing serum. The results as shown in Fig. 4 .4b, clearly demonstrates the feasibility to detect the binding of HSV-1 in the presence of serum. The observed phase change is in good agreement with the measurement of HSV-1 in buffer as indicated in Fig. 10 .16a. To further confirm the specificity of HSV-1-a-HSV-1 gG interaction, a control experiment in which no antibody was immobilized in the measuring channel was performed. No response was measured when the virus solution in serum was applied (graph not shown), indicating the specificity of HSV-1-a-HSV-1 gG interaction. These results show the possibility to specifically detect capture of HSV-1 particles, even at very low particle concentrations and at a low number of virus particles.",

Furthermore, even at the lowest measured virus concentration (850 particles/ml) a high signal-to-noise ratio of 2 \u00c2 10 2 (at a bandwidth of 0.1 Hz) is achieved. Therefore it is predicted that the current YI sensor is able to detect even much lower concentrations.

This results in a phase change of $1.1 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 fringes\u02d9for the binding of a single virus particle. From this estimation it is derived that for the lowest measured concentration $700 virus particles were detected with an average binding rate of 1 virus every 4 s.

These tests are performed by immobilizing different receptor layers in adjacent measuring channels and monitoring the sensor response to different analyte solutions. To do so, antihuman serum albumin (a-HSA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) was immobilized in channel 1 by flowing a 200 mg/ml a-HSA solution prepared in PBS. In channel 2, a-HSV-1 gG was immobilized. Next, a solution of 50 mg/ml human serum albumin (HSA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) in PBS was simultaneously applied in channels 1 and 2 and after approximately 30 min, flow was changed back to PBS for both channels. The observed binding curves are shown in Fig. 10 .17 (graphs A1 and A2, respectively). After achievement of a stable baseline, a 10 5 particles/ml HSV-1 solution was flowed in both channels (see B1 and B2 in Fig. 10.17 , respectively). The observation that a response is measured only for the a-HSA-HSA and a-HSV-1 gG-HSV-1 interactions is a clear indication that the signals are caused by specific interactions and that crossreactivity between coatings is negligible.",

To this end the integration of the chip with microfluidic sample handling would strongly enhance the robustness and compactness of the sensor. Figure 10 .18 shows a four-channel YI sensor chip integrated with a microfluidic system 42 . The microfluidic system was designed such that each measuring channel can be addressed individually. The channels are fabricated in a transparent glass plate with cross-sectional dimensions of 200 mm \u00c2 15 mm. The glass plate is glued onto the IO-chip using a UV curable resin. A major advantage of the microfluidic system over the cuvette system is, apart from the improved robustness of the sensor, the strongly enhanced time-response of the sensor. Experiments on monitoring the antihuman serum albumin/human serum albumin immunoreaction show that the response time of the sensor of 100 s achieved with a bulky cuvette, is reduced to 4 s (at similar sample flow). This improvement is due to the much smaller dimensions of the microfluidic channels compared to those of the cuvette. Reduced dimensions, especially the height of the flow channel, imply higher flow velocities at the sample-sensor surface interface and shorter diffusion times of molecules/analytes. Both aspects improve the time-response of the sensor. In addition the total sample volume required is also strongly reduced from the sub-ml to the ml range.",

However, to be suitable for application in the field of clinical diagnostics assays the sensor also has to specific. The sensor signal should only be sensitive to the binding of the analyte of interest and not to other molecules or viruses in the sample. Therefore it is extremely important that these types of sensors are tested with clinically relevant samples. Specificity of the sensor thus strongly depends on the \"chemical\" coating of the sensor surface. The use of a pA-based coating was used to successfully detect HSV-1 viruses in human blood serum (this work) at clinically relevant concentrations. More recently it was shown that tuberculosisspecific antibodies can be detected with a YI sensor in undiluted human blood serum 39 . The availability of antibodies with high-specificity and low crossreactivity for relevant antigens, combined with these results suggest that YIbased sensors can combine very high sensitivity with good specificity and therefore provide a solid foundation for further development of YI sensors for clinical diagnostic assays.",
