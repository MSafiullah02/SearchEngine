A number of studies have investigated human-to-human transmission via expiratory droplets inside built environments with a view to minimizing it, but there are also other airborne pathways that can transmit pathogens. When external energy is used to disintegrate liquid into airborne droplets, the process is referred to as atomization. The splashing of water droplets during the flushing process is commonly observed when toilets are poorly designed or the flushing pressure is too high. In addition to the relatively large droplets that are visible (~ millimeters in size), the toilet flushing process is also known to atomize numerous smaller airborne droplets. It was demonstrated as long ago as the 1960s that droplets with airborne pathogens can be generated during the toilet flushing process, thereby creating infectious hazards. 3 More recent studies have revealed a very high viral load, up to 10 11 viral particles per gram of fecal matter. 4 If feces containing pathogenic organisms are shed by an infected person and contaminate toilet fluid, the atomized droplets produced may well be infectious. [5] [6] [7] The results of previous studies have raised concern over the aerosolization of excreta containing such intestinal or urinary pathogenic microorganisms as Aeromonas sp., Bacillus sp., Campylobacter sp., Clostridium sp., Escherichia sp., Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas sp., Salmonella sp., Serratia sp., Shigella sp., and Staphylococcus sp. presenting either as colonization or infection. 8 Among all pathogens concerned, noroviruses have received the greatest attention, particularly in elderly and healthcare settings. 9 In addition, pathogens other than the typical intestinal pathogens, including the deadly SARS-CoV and Ebola virus, have also been detected in excreta, thus further raising concerns about the potentially infectious pathogen-laden aerosols generated by toilet flushing.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1203, "end": 1204, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1317, "end": 1318, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1479, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1483, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1487, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1872, "end": 1873, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2004, "end": 2005, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "When the fecal shedding of pathogenic organisms takes place in the toilet bowl of a public washroom, flushing the toilet may expose subsequent washroom users through primary exposure to contaminated aerosols via direct inhalation, and/or secondary exposure may occur via contact with contaminated surfaces. 10 Large droplets settle within 1-2 m, 11 and are highly likely to contaminate such environmental surfaces as door handles, banisters, and flush handles. 12 Small droplets generally refer to droplet nuclei with a diameter in the range of less than 5 \u03bcm. As they settle slowly in the air, they can travel farther and for a much longer duration. 13 It has been reported that contaminated droplet nuclei can be dispersed to other areas of a washroom, 14 and they have even been found outside a mock-up toilet cubicle. 3 Barker and Jones 6 conducted a toilet seeding experiment in which they measured the level of bioaerosols generated by the flushing of a residential toilet. They reported the amount of Serratia marcescens in the air to increase sharply from zero colony-forming units per cubic meter (CFU/m 3 ) to 1370 CFU/m 3 after the first flush. However, a later study 15 recorded a much smaller number of size-resolved flushinggenerated airborne droplets than that observed by Barker and Jones. 5 A similar study was recently conducted in a hospital to determine the concentration of Clostridium difficile following flushing. It found that even with the toilet lid down, aerosolized droplets could be recovered 10 cm above the seat within 60 minutes of flushing. 16 Quantification of the potential transmission risk of pathogen-laden aerosols is important. Emission strength is the most important of all known parameters for such quantification, 17 but has rarely been investigated. Quantifying the risk of potential transmission based on indirect evidence without carrying out controlled experiments is unreliable. It is believed that flushing systems (and related parameters) exert the strongest effect on airborne pathogen emission.

All public housing in Hong Kong, which accommodates ~30% of the approximately 7.3 million population, is equipped with such toilets. The flushometer was designed to supply 14 L per flush (Naval Exposed Water Closet, Sloan, USA).

The outlet of the bowl was connected to a stainless steel water tank (with a capacity of 50 L), and a booster pump with a pneumatic pressure vessel was installed to deliver water from the storage tank to the flushometer, thereby forming a closed-loop circuit in which water discharged from the water closet was recirculated. The cistern tank system was simpler in design. A standard cistern tank was purchased from a local plumbing store and filled with 14 L of tap water for each flush.

Toilet seat covers and surface disinfectants are effective in preventing contact with and the transmission of surface contaminants to other users, but they cannot prevent airborne transmission. A high degree of disinfection efficacy has been observed for automatic toilet bowl tablets, 23 which work through the continuous release of disinfectants to kill microorganisms. However, their short lifespan and efficacy only for cistern systems are two concerns with their use. Before any mitigation measures can be proposed, the exposure risk must be quantified, and the most important factor in such risk is source emission strength. Although comprehensive measurements were performed in this research, there were a number of limitations. First, feces vary in consistency from watery to formed, and also vary from individual to individual and within individuals at different times. Moreover, there are also many more toilet bowl designs than those investigated in this research, such as wash-down and siphonic designs. Both of these factors may affect emission dynamics, but did not fall into our study objectives and hence are not addressed herein. Nonetheless, our results on total droplet generation are in good agreement with the results of other studies, which strengthens the conclusions drawn herein. Second, the study could have been improved by considering a wider droplet size range in testing our hypothesis.
