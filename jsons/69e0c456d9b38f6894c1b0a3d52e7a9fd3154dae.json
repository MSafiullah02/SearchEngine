Dogs were randomized into 2 groups: 15 dogs received no food until vomiting had ceased for 12 hours (mean 50 hours after admission; NPO group), and 15 dogs received early EN by nasoesophageal tube from 12 hours after admission (EEN group). All other treatments were identical. Intestinal permeability was assessed by 6-hour urinary lactulose (L) and rhamnose (R) recoveries (%L, %R) and L/R recovery ratios. Intestinal protein loss was quantified by fecal \u2423 1 -proteinase inhibitor concentrations (\u2423 1 -PI). Median time to normalization of demeanor, appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea was 1 day shorter for the EEN group for each variable. Body weight increased insignificantly from admission in the NPO group (day 3: 2.5 \u03ee 2.8%; day 6: 4.3 \u03ee 2.3%; mean \u03ee SE), whereas the EEN group exhibited significant weight gain (day 3: 8.1 \u03ee 2.7%; day 6: 9.7 \u03ee 2.1%). Mean urinary %L was increased, %R reduced, and L/R recovery ratios increased compared to reference values throughout the study for both groups. Percent lactulose recovery decreased in the EEN group (admission: 22.6 \u03ee 8.0%; day 6: 17.9 \u03ee 2.3%) and increased in the NPO group (admission: 11.0 \u03ee 2.6%; day 6: 22.5 \u03ee 4.6%, P \u03ed .035). Fecal \u2423 1 -PI was above reference values in both groups and declined progressively. No significant differences occurred for %R, L/R ratios, or \u2423 1 -PI between groups. Thirteen NPO dogs and all EEN dogs survived (P \u03ed .48). The EEN group showed earlier clinical improvement and significant weight gain. The significantly decreased %L in the EEN versus NPO group might reflect improved gut barrier function, which could limit bacterial or endotoxin translocation.",

Novel adjunctive drugs have been investigated, but results have been disappointing or variable. 1, [4] [5] [6] There is a distinct need for therapies that decrease disease severity and hospitalization time, improve survival, and reduce treatment cost. 1, 7 Despite the lack of controlled clinical studies, conventional wisdom has dictated that ''gut rest,'' achieved by allowing no ingestion of food, remains the nutritional therapy of choice for CPV enteritis. The recommended duration of starvation ranges from 24 to 72 hours after vomiting has ceased. 2, 3, 8 Canine parvovirus exhibits tropism for rapidly replicating cell populations of the intestinal crypt epithelium and lymphoid and hematopoietic tissues. 9 Small intestinal viral proliferation causes extensive epithelial necrosis with villus blunting and atrophy. 2, 9 Lymphoid necrosis and atrophy occurs in gut-associated and systemic lymphoid tissues. 9 Bacteremia, 10,11 endotoxemia, 1,7,10 high serum tumor necrosis factor concentrations, 7 and multiple organ dysfunctions 11 occur frequently. The disruption of gut barrier function in CPV enteritis likely underlies bacterial and endotoxin translocation, resultant bacteremia and endotoxemia, and development of the systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes.",

The underlying principle involves the passive, non-carrier-mediated transmucosal diffusion of sugars of different sizes administered PO with their subsequent excretion and quantification in urine. [26] [27] [28] [29] Intestinal permeability to a sugar is an inverse function of its cross-sectional diameter. 30 The permeation of rhamnose (molecular diameter 8.3 angstroms, molecular weight 164 daltons) in healthy dogs is 7-to 13-fold greater than that of lactulose (9.5 \u00c5 , 342 daltons). 31, 32 Because the sugars traverse the epithelium by different pathways and in differing amounts, their urinary recoveries provide information about intestinal structure and integrity. Lactulose and rhamnose are widely accepted markers of intestinal permeability in dogs and humans. Many intestinal diseases are accompanied by an increased permeation of lactulose and a decreased permeation of rhamnose. Alpha 1 -proteinase inhibitor (\u2423 1 -PI) is a plasma protein, of which concentration in feces provides a sensitive and specific quantitative measure of gastrointestinal protein loss in diseases with transmucosal loss of plasma, lymph, or intercellular fluid. 33 The efficacy of the currently advised strategy of initial starvation in CPV enteritis has never been scientifically investigated. A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of early EN on intestinal permeability, intestinal protein loss, and clinical outcome in naturally occurring severe CPV enteritis.",

The test solution was formulated immediately before each dosing by dissolving lactulose m and rhamnose n in tap water to produce a solution with concentrations of 33.3 mg/mL rhamnose and 33.3 mg/mL lactulose and an osmolality of approximately 305 mOsm/L (isosmolar).

            "text": "The precise transepithelial permeation pathways of probes used for intestinal permeability tests have not been established definitively. 27, 28, 37, 38 According to the classical hypothesis, monosaccharides (eg, rhamnose) permeate transcellularly via small aqueous pores of high incidence in enterocyte cell membranes. 26, 28, 29 In contrast, disaccharides (eg, lactulose) are hypothesized to permeate paracellularly via larger aqueous channels of low incidence, located in the region of intercellular tight junctions. 26, 28, 29 The progressive decrease in %L in the EEN group, as compared to a continued increase in the NPO group, might thus reflect improved integrity of epithelial tight junctions attributable to File # 21em early EN. In part, this may be a result of decreased intestinal inflammation because pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 and interferon-\u2425) impair tight junction structure and function. 39 Lactulose might also permeate paracellularly through a disrupted epithelium (ie, necrosis, ulceration, or erosion), 26, 28, 40, 41 and the decreased %L in dogs with early EN could thus indicate earlier repair of intestinal epithelial necrosis. Earlier repair of epithelial necrosis or improved tight junction structure or function with early EN potentially might have improved gut barrier function with decreased transmucosal passage of luminal compounds. Translocation of bacteria, endotoxin, or luminal antigens could locally intensify intestinal inflammation 19, 42 or systemically initiate the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. 42 Because intestinal inflammation, 19, 42 endotoxemia, 43 and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome 19 might further increase intestinal permeability, a reduction in any of these events could limit further gut barrier compromise. The decreased %L with early EN could also indicate earlier intestinal flora normalization because small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, known to occur in CPV enteritis, 44 increases intestinal permeability. 45 The decreased %R in both treatment groups is consistent with villus atrophy, with reduced surface area for rhamnose permeation. 26, 28, 40 Further %R decreases over time in both groups might reflect progressive villus atrophy, intestinal ischemia or congestion, 38, 46 or altered immature enterocyte membrane phospholipid composition and transcellular membrane pores. 28 Failure to demonstrate a difference between groups in L/ R ratio changes over time, even though lactulose permeations differed significantly, could be a result of small patient numbers and the large interindividual variability of this parameter within data points. By expressing the urinary sugar recoveries as a ratio, factors unrelated to mucosal permeability (eg, vomiting, gastrointestinal motility, glomerular filtration rate, and others) are excluded because both markers should be equally affected. [26] [27] [28] Differences in gastrointestinal motility between groups might thus potentially have contributed to the differing lactulose permeations. It is of interest that the highest L/R ratios in both groups occurred at the time of discharge from hospital, when intestinal morphological integrity would be expected to be most normal. This brings to question whether L/R ratios accurately reflect the severity of intestinal epithelial disruption in CPV enteritis. There is general agreement that lactulose permeation is an appropriate measure of the functional or physical gut barrier, 26, 28, 29, 40, 41 whereas rhamnose permeation can be affected by mucosal factors not directly related to intestinal integrity. 26, 28, 38, 40, 46 The individual sugar recoveries could thus provide more specific information relating to epithelial integrity and structure.",

The increase in %L over time in the NPO group, in combination with the decreased fecal \u2423 1 -PI loss over time, might indicate that the continued increase in lactulose permeation in the NPO group occurred primarily through altered tight junctions, rather than through a disrupted epithelium because the latter would be expected to be associated with greater intestinal protein loss.",

Two of the NPO dogs were Rottweilers, a breed with reported susceptibility to more severe CPV disease, whereas there were no Rottweilers in the EEN group.

Because of vomiting, the amount of EN that effectively reached the intestine in the EEN group is unknown. Some studies suggest that at least 25% of total daily caloric requirements should be delivered enterally to prevent intestinal mucosal atrophy. 20, 21 This study demonstrates that early EN can be instituted successfully in CPV enteritis, even with severe vomiting and diarrhea.

The addition of dietary nonfermentable insoluble fiber (eg, cellulose) could further decrease bacterial translocation. 50, 51 Enteral formulations containing immune-enhancing nutrients (arginine, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and nucleotides, with or without glutamine or branch-chain amino acids) have produced significant reductions in infectious morbidity and length of hospitalization, as compared to standard EN diets in human critical illness and sepsis. 52 Such formulations might be beneficial in CPV enteritis.
