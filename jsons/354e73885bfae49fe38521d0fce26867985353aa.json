This area is constantly in contact with the ambient air and is therefore vulnerable to contamination with airborne microbes and particles of respirable size. Due to the configuration of the respiratory tract, airborne particles having diameters in the range of 0.5-2.0 m can reach and deposit in the terminal part of the tracheobronchial tree -most bacteria are of this size. In reality, very few bacteria cause infections by spreading via the airborne route (e.g., mycobacteria, viruses, and legionella). Most bacteria cause pneumonia by first colonizing the upper respiratory tract and later descending into the tracheobronchial tree.",

Fibronectins normally prevent bacterial adherence to epithelial surfaces and when the fibronectin film is removed, the adherence of pathogenic bacteria to the oropharyngeal epithelium is facilitated. Increased bacterial adherence leads to colonization of the upper respiratory tract by enteric gram-negative bacteria, and this predisposes to the later development of nosocomial pneumonia (NP). The incidence of colonization with gram-negative rods mounts with the gravity of the illness 75 as well as with the degree of supportive care required by the patient. 159 Once gram negative aerobes colonize the oropharynx, the stage is set for the aspiration of these noxious organisms into the lower respiratory tract, with the potential peril of NP. The link between NP and oropharyngeal colonization has been established by several studies. In one study, NP occurred in 23% 11.2 Microbiology of patients in whom prior oropharyngeal colonization was documented, but in only 3.3% of noncolonized patients. 75 11.1 Incidence Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a form of NP, and several mechanisms of pathogenesis are common to the two. NP is the most common infection in the ICU and the most deadly of all nosocomial infections. It is the second most common nosocomial infection overall, second only to urinary tract infection. 64 Although prevalence has been shown to vary between 12 and 29% in different studies, 89 the mortality rate of NP has been uniformly high (20-50%). 1, 37 The case fatality ranges between 25 and 33% in most studies, 50 though pneumonia is not necessarily the cause of death in these patients. 35 Mechanically ventilated patients have extremely high infection rates -the incidence of NP may be 17-23% higher in intubated patients.

With advancing age and malnutrition, or in achlorhydric states, or indeed with the use of certain drugs that increase the gastric pH, 47 the stomach is liable to get populated with bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria proliferate exponentially with rising in gastric pH: the use of antacids and H 2 blocking agents in the ICU has been shown to be associated with increased gastric colonization. 157 It appears that the gastric contents can reach the lungs in a number of ways. Recumbency encourages retrograde movement of the gastric contents up the esophagus, facilitating oropharyngeal colonization. Large volume gastric feeds that overwhelm the limited emptying time of the stomach in critically ill patients further encourage reflux. Nasogastric tubes, especially of wide bore interfere with the functioning of the gastroesophageal sphincter, and so promote regurgitation. 159 The presence of a nasogastric tube can encourage oropharyngeal colonization by various mechanisms. The nasogastric tube may provide a conduit whereby bacteria are transmitted upon its surface in a retrograde fashion from the stomach to the oropharynx, in a manner analogous to the urinary infection that occurs in catheterized patients. 80 Gastric colonization might also be facilitated by the erosion of the oropharyngeal mucosa by the nasogastric tube, in the same manner that endotracheal-induced erosion of tracheal mucosa encourages tracheal colonization with bacteria. 131 Although this sequence of events is certainly plausible, even one study could not prove that nasogastric tubes could indeed predispose to NP. 15 At this time it is unclear whether initial gastric colonization -with subsequent oropharyngeal colonization, and then aspiration of the contaminated secretions -could be one of the key mechanisms in the genesis of NP. Bacteria isolated from gastric juice have frequently -but not always -been shown to be identical to the bacteria isolated from the lung, and this may imply a causal relationship between the two. 47,77",

As many as 10% of orally intubated patients have been found to have evidence of sinusitis by culture of maxillary sinus secretions, 20 and the incidence may be much higher in nasally intubated patients. 133 The evidence that bacterial sinusitis can lead to VAP is as yet circumstantial, but the flora isolated from the sinuses has been identical to the flora isolated from the lungs in a high proportion of cases of VAP. 133 Indeed, the flora in nosocomial sinus infections tends to be polymicrobial or predominantly gram negative as does the flora in NPs. 147 Anaerobic organisms are also common. 90 The occurrence of sinusitis in the ICU patient can be related to a variety of mechanisms that are unique to the critically ill patient. Nasogastric 153 and nasotracheal tubes 125 act as foreign bodies, and these elicit a local mucosal reaction. The ensuing mucus hypersecretion and mucosal edema is liable to block sinus ostia, permitting pooling of secretions within the blocked sinuses. Stagnated secretions within the sinuses act as culture media for bacteria; once contaminated, the sinuses act as foci of sepsis, with the potential for dissemination into other areas. It appears that biofilms can form upon plastic nasogastric tubes, much in the same manner as they can within endotracheal tubes. 128 In the recumbent and immobile ICU patient, the gravitational advantage for natural sinus drainage is lost. 5 Furthermore, in a patient on positive pressure ventilation, the raised intrathoracic pressure diminishes the venous return from the head and neck contributing to nasal mucosal congestion and sinus ostial occlusion. 5 It is also possible that the absence of the normal airflow through the nose in an intubated patient, as also the absence of sneezing and coughing reflexes, may make the patient susceptible to infection.",

To this end, it is desirable to have objective indices wherever possible, but this is easier said than done. Qualitative techniques are generally nonspecific and can lead to unnecessary or inappropriate antibiotic therapy. 52 Quantitative cultures are more representative, but colony counts above the generally accepted levels may not by themselves be diagnostic of pneumonia. Nevertheless, when 1,000 or more colony forming units are grown per milliliter, this means that 1,000-1,000,000 bacteria are present in every mL of the recovered lavage fluid, and this is usually considered significant. 154 These numbers emerge from the observation that pathogens in distal lung secretions prevail at concentrations of at least 10 5 -10 6 colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/mL). 8 Only 1 mL or so of the >100 mL returned is truly representative of one million-odd alveoli sampled during a typical broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL): the number of pathogens in 100 mL of the returning fluid will be about one million cfu. In contrast, colonizing organisms prevail at much lower concentrations (<10 4 cfu/mL). As can be expected, the microbial yield will increase in direct proportion to the quantity of returning lavage fluid. 11.5 Diagnosis of VAP Bronchoalveolar lavage samples are probably representative if 5% or more lavaged cells show intracellular organisms. 4 In such cases, the likelihood of the sample being representative may be Box 11.4 Technique of Broncho-Alveolar Lavage (BAL) 1 .

Aqueous porin channels contained within the outer wall allow solutes including antibiotics to diffuse into the bacterial cell. 114 Alteration of porin channels within gram negative bacteria can impede the penetration of the antibiotic into the bacterial cell. The production and concentration of beta-lactamases and other antibiotic-inactivating enzymes within the periplasmic space by gram-negative bacteria has become a cause of troublesome bacterial resistance the world over. In addition, both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria can have intracellular inactivating enzymes. Bacteria can also alter antibiotic target sites within themselves, or even develop an efflux mechanism to actively pump antibiotics outside the bacterial cell, thereby limiting intracellular antibiotic concentrations. Resistance in gram negative bacteria most frequently is mediated by their production of (beta-lactamase) enzymes that rapidly inactivate the beta-lactam antibiotics. Over 500 beta-lactamases have been identified now; 5 times the number that microbiologists were aware of, 30 years ago. Beta-lactamase production can result in bacterial resistance to a large spectrum of powerful beta-lactam agents. The enormity of the problem can be appreciated by the fact that it took just 2 years after the introduction of ceftazidime and ceftriaxone for the first extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) to be recognized. 140 Since then, there has been a tremendous surge in the frequency with which ESBLs are encountered worldwide. The local prevalence of ESBLs has been shown to vary greatly, and pockets of local dissemination rather than wide-range spread are usual. ESBLs have mostly been encountered in Klebsiella isolates and their incidence worldwide appears to be on the increase. Importantly, once established within the ICU or the hospital, ESBLs can be extremely difficult to eradicate. For the treatment of severe infection by ESBL producing strains, carbapenems like imipenem may be most appropriate. 123 Certain bacteria, in particular, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter, are especially adept at developing drug resistance and may do so through several highly specialized and innovative mechanisms. The major mechanism of resistance is chromosomal or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase production, but Pseudomonas, for instance, can also modify pencillin binding proteins and prevent aminologlycoside binding to ribosomes. Further, Pseudomonas can develop multi-drug resistance (MDR) by decreasing cellular permeability to beta-lactams and four quinolones, in addition to actively pumping these drugs outside the bacterial cell. 25 Resistance to four-quinolones can also develop by mutations at chromosomal loci encoding binding sites on DNA-gyrase.",

Monotherapy may be acceptable in nonbacteremic cases and a carbapenem could be used. A beta-lactam antibiotic with antipseudomonal action plus either an aminoglycoside or ciprofloxacin is a commonly used regimen. Because of resistance issues, dual antibiotic coverage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa may be important, especially in bacteremic cases. 70 Cephalosporins as first-line agents are generally not preferred because of their propensity to select out resistant pseudomonas, and the combination of a broader spectrum penicillin (such as pipercillin with or without tazobactam) along with an aminoglycoside may be more suitable. Indeed, empiric usage of ceftazidime has been incriminated in the emergence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing bacteria. It is equally likely that if other antibiotics are used regularly as monotherapy, similar patterns of resistance could emerge. The pharmacokinetics of aminoglycosides preclude their role as sole agents for pneumonia. Since the lungs are, in effect, large capillary beds, penetration of most antibiotics into the lungs is adequate; aminoglycosides act poorly in the acidic milieu that is present locally in the pneumonic lung.

It is generally possible to eliminate relatively rapidly, the organisms that cause early NP -H. influenzae and S. pneumonia. 40 On the other hand, the Enterobacteriaceae, S. aureus need more prolonged courses of antibiotic. 40 Certain microbes, particularly Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter show high rates of treatment failure and relapse. In such cases antibiotic therapy may be extended to a minimum of 2-3 weeks. Unnecessarily prolonged antibiotic therapy often results in bacterial colonization, and this then presages recurrent VAP. 145 In responders, an initial course of about 8 days may be as effective as a 14 day course. 23 ",
