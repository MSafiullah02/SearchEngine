            "text": "Individuals have been documented as experiencing fatigue, or exhaustion in certain circumstances, since written records have been kept. The earliest medical literature identifies individuals who are chronically fatigued but have no other identifiable medical or psychiatric illness that would account for these symptoms, and these individuals have been described by many different labels over the millennia. In 1869, Beard first coined the term neurasthenia to describe a condition that occurred from depletion of the central nervous system's energy reserves, which Beard attributed to the consequences of aspects of modern civilization. Physicians in the Beard school of thought associated neurasthenia with the stresses of urbanization and the stress experienced a result of an increasingly competitive business environment. Typically, the condition was associated with members of the upper class or professionals with sedentary employment. The term neurasthenia has largely been abandoned, and no evidence suggests that this disorder was one of urbanization.",

            "text": "Many other terms for chronic fatiguing illnesses have arisen, inappropriately, from attributing the chronic symptoms experienced by patients with these illnesses to those of an active infection. For example, terms such as Akureyri disease, Iceland disease, Royal Free disease, and Tapanui flu all have been used first to describe specific outbreaks of patients with chronic fatiguing illnesses and then used more widely to describe others who had demonstrated similar symptoms. These patients, typically affected by severe postinfectious fatigue, may also experience multifocal pain (including in regions such as the muscles, throat, and neck, which are painful during many acute infections), sleep disturbances, memory difficulties, and many other somatic symptoms.",

The patients in this study were extensively evaluated by both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and several academic groups, and they were found to have immunological abnormalities as well as evidence of elevated antibodies to a number of different viral pathogens, leading to the theory that there was an active viral illness that was causing these symptoms. However, after extensive subsequent investigations of this group of patients, as well as many other clusters of patients initially identified as part of an \u201cepidemic\u201d of fatiguing illness, it became increasingly clear that neither this symptom complex nor any immunological abnormalities identified were specific to any single epidemic, or single pathogen [2, 3, 4, 5].",

Some of these inaccurately characterized this condition to be the result of a single common pathogen, or ubiquitous organisms, hence, the names chronic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), mycoplasma, or yeast infections [6, 7, 8]. Finally, we will reject the use of terms not supported by pathophysiological evidence, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis. A recurring problem in the history of this illness is that causality has not yet been established but is asserted on the basis of cross-sectional studies or without appropriate control groups. These assertions are almost incorrect, in part because both the symptom complexes and objective \u201cabnormalities\u201d used to infer cause (eg, immunological, neuroendocrine, imaging findings) are very common in the general population [9, 10, 11].",

In addition, 4 or more of the following symptoms must occur with fatigue in a 6-month period: impaired memory or concentration, sore throat, tender glands, aching or stiff muscles, multijoint pain, new headaches, unrefreshing sleep, and postexertional fatigue [14]. Medical conditions that may explain the prolonged fatigue as well as a number of psychiatric diagnoses (eg, eating disorders, psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, melancholic depression, and substance abuse within 2 years of the onset of fatigue) exclude a patient from the diagnosis of CFS. A notable feature of the CDC case definition is that many nonpsychotic psychiatric disorders are not exclusionary for the diagnosis of CFS. Those who do not meet the fatigue severity or symptom criteria can be given a diagnosis of ICF.",

In fact, most patients with CFS have prominent pain in multiple anatomical regions, especially if they are queried about chronic pain over the course of their lifetime.

A physiatrist seeing the same patient may focus on the few most severe regions of pain and diagnose myofascial pain, whereas a rheumatologist instead notes that the pain is more widespread and not accompanied by inflammation and diagnoses FM.

Spastic colitis similarly became IBS, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome became temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD), and interstitial cystitis is well on its way to be renamed painful bladder syndrome, all because of the recognition that central factors rather than peripheral damage or inflammation appear to be driving the pain. Even psychiatrists got into the misnaming game.

            "text": "The current thinking about these overlapping symptoms and syndromes is as follows, and will be reviewed in greater detail:\u2022The core symptoms seen in patients with these illnesses are multifocal pain, fatigue, insomnia, cognitive or memory problems, and, in many cases, psychological distress [9, 39]. Some patients in the population only have one of these symptoms, but more often patients have many, and the precise location of the pain, and the severity and quality of the fatigue, changes over time. Thus, in clinical practice it is useful to evaluate patients with idiopathic fatigue regarding fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbances during the course of their lifetime. It may be that when patients have this pattern of symptoms and past diagnoses, then they have a FM-like central pain syndrome, and if not, then other reasons for fatigue must be more strongly considered.\u2022The presence and severity of these symptoms vary across populations. All of the diagnostic labels in current use are to some degree arbitrary because there is no objective tissue pathology or gold standard to which \u201cdisease\u201d can be anchored.\u2022These symptoms and syndromes occur approximately 1.5 to 2 times more commonly in women than men. The gender difference appears more apparent in clinical samples (especially tertiary care), however, than in population-based samples [37, 38].\u2022There is a strong familial predisposition to these symptoms and illnesses, and studies clearly show that these somatic symptoms and syndromes are separable from depression and other psychiatric disorders [39, 40, 41].\u2022A variety of biological stressors appear to be capable of either triggering or exacerbating these symptoms and illnesses, including physical trauma, infections, early life trauma, and deployment to war, in addition to some other types of psychological stressors (eg, there was no increase in somatic symptoms or worsening of FM after the terrorist attacks of 9/11) [42, 43].\u2022Groups of patients with these conditions (eg, FM, IBS, chronic headache, TMJD, CFS) display diffuse hyperalgesia (increased pain in response to normally painful stimuli) and/or allodynia (pain in response to normally nonpainful stimuli). Many patients with these conditions also have been shown to demonstrate more sensitivity to many stimuli other than pain (ie, auditory, visual), and data suggest that these patients have a fundamental problem with pain or sensory processing rather than an abnormality confined to the specific body region in which the pain is being experienced. In fact, the expanded relevance of the FM construct relates to the idea that all patients (with and without pain) have different \u201cvolume control\u201d settings on their pain and sensory processing. The position on this bell-shaped curve of pain or sensory sensitivity largely determines whether they will have pain or other sensory symptoms during the course of their lifetime and how severe these symptoms will be.\u2022In addition to pain and sensory amplification, other shared underlying mechanisms that have been identified in these illnesses include: (1) neurogenic inflammation, especially of mucosal surfaces, leading to increased mast cells and the appearance of a mild inflammatory process in the periphery; (2) autonomic nervous system dysfunction; and (3) hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction.\u2022Similar types of therapies are efficacious for all of these conditions, including both pharmacological (eg, tricyclic compounds such as amitriptyline) and nonpharmacological treatments (eg, exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]). Conversely, patients with these conditions typically do not respond to therapies that are effective when pain is attributable to damage or inflammation of tissues (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, opioids, injections, surgical procedures). The aforementioned list is meant to be a summary of the findings across the functional somatic or central sensitivity field. CFS is a heterogeneous disorder and likely includes patients who have entirely different pathophysiology, such as those who have an infectious or metabolic condition that has yet to be identified.",

Several reports document that CFS typically occurs in patients who had high premorbid levels of activity, and, in fact, high premorbid levels of activity and a lower body mass in young adulthood were the strongest predictors of CFS later in life [27, 65]. Patients often report excellent preillness physical fitness and energy and an abrupt onset of fatigue. After the onset of illness, patients indicate that physical exertion tends to exacerbate the fatigue. Glass et al [66] demonstrated that within a group of healthy, young subjects, the ones who developed multiple somatic symptoms after experimental exercise cessation were those that had autonomic and immune profiles resembling those of CFS patients. Recent studies performed by our group further examined the additive and synergistic roles that sleep restriction and exercise cessation have on the development of somatic symptoms in healthy patients and demonstrated that regular exercise seems to buffer some of the adverse effects of sleep on symptom development. Female patients were much more likely to have somatic symptoms when deprived of either sleep or exercise.",

As noted previously, both epidemiologic and twin studies have shown that CFS and other CSS are clearly separate from conditions such as anxiety and depression [39]. Patients with psychiatric conditions earlier in life have a 2 to 3 times greater risk of developing CFS than those who do not have premorbid psychiatric diagnoses, but this still means that most patients with CFS in the general population neither had or have a diagnosable psychiatric condition [69].",

It is best to think of psychological and psychiatric symptoms similarly to sleep or cognitive disturbances in CFS, that is, as a domain that is important to evaluate in patients with CFS because abnormalities can often be identified.

There are often accompanying somatic symptoms such as fatigue, memory, and mood difficulties. The risk of this symptom complex occurring with various infections is consistently found to be approximately 5% to 10%. The reason for this consistency is not clear. Evidently, the inciting infection must be of sufficient severity and duration because the increase in occurrence of chronic symptoms is not observed after common viral infections of short duration. This lack of specificity regarding the triggering effect of infection may well be associated with an underlying genetic predisposition, activated in a similar manner by various pathogens, and/or in patients with a set of \u201cmaladaptive\u201d behavioral responses that could lead to symptoms, such as cessation of routine exercise or sleep.",

Any of these could lead to an \u201cincrease in the volume control\u201d and augmented pain and sensory processing [111, 112, 113, 114]. The only neurotransmitter system that has been studied to date and not found to be out of line in a direction that would cause augmented pain transmission is the endogenous opioid system.

These systems are mediated primarily by the activity of the corticotropin-releasing hormone nervous system located in the hypothalamus and locus-ceruleus-norepinephrine/autonomic nervous system in the brain stem. Recent research suggests that although this system in humans has been highly adaptive throughout history, the stress response may be inappropriately triggered by a wide assortment of everyday occurrences that do not pose a real threat to survival, thus initiating the cascade of physiologic responses more frequently than can be tolerated [117]. The type of stress and the environment in which it occurs also have an impact on how the stress response is expressed. It has been noted that victims of accidents experience a greater frequency of FM and myofascial pain than those who cause them, which is congruent with animal studies showing that that the strongest physiological responses are triggered by events that are accompanied by a lack of control or support and thus viewed as perceived as inescapable or unavoidable [118].

Female gender, worry or expectation of chronicity, lack of control of the stressor, intensity of the initial symptoms, and inactivity or time off work after the stressor make it more likely to trigger the development of pain, fatigue, or other somatic symptoms [119]. Naturally occurring catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, or fires are much less likely to lead to chronic somatic symptoms than similarly stressful events that are \u201chuman-made,\u201d such as chemical spills, or war [120]. Being exposed to a multitude of stressors simultaneously, or during a period of time, may also be a significant risk for later somatic symptoms and or psychological sequelae.

Going back to the \u201cessential hypertension of pain processing pathway\u201d analogy, just as we use 8 to 10 classes of drugs acting in different body systems and at different molecular targets to control hypertension, and patients may respond very well to one class of antihypertensive drug but not another, the same is true of CSS syndromes. Patients may only respond to one of these classes of drugs or may often be in several classes of centrally acting analgesics (eg, a low dose of cyclobenzaprine at bedtime, pregabalin or gabapentin either just at bedtime or twice daily, and a serotonin-norepineprine reuptake inhibitor such as duloxetine or milnacipran during the day). However, our current pharmacological armamentarium is not nearly as well-developed for central pain as for essential hypertension, which is likely one of the reasons that these syndromes are often still difficult to treat.",

The physiological cost of walking is significantly greater for people with CFS compared with healthy subjects. The reasons for these greater energy demands for walking in those with CFS have yet to be fully elucidated, but research suggests the physiological need for very slow, graded exercise programs to treat CFS and other related conditions [160, 161]. Light and colleagues have recently demonstrated that after moderate exercise, CFS and CFS-FMS patients show enhanced gene expression for receptors detecting muscle metabolites and for sympathetic nervous system activation [162]. This finding supports the need for a \u201cstart low, go slow\u201d therapeutic approach to exercise in CFS, especially because exacerbations after overactivity are very common.",
