In mild cases patients may not even contact their health care provider, and even if they do, stools may not be tested. A careful history should include the duration of symptoms and the frequency and characteristics of stool. Severe diarrhea alone, defined as greater than 4 liquid stools per day for more than 3 days, is often a bacterial cause. Fever and peritoneal signs may indicate infection with an enteric pathogen. Blood in the stool is usually an indication of an inflammatory process from invasive bacteria. Residence, recent and remote travel, occupational exposures, pets, and hobbies can provide clues to the origin of the diarrhea. Studies have shown that most cases of acute infectious gastroenteritis are viral. This article focuses on viral gastroenteritis.",

The financial burden to society through direct and indirect costs can be overwhelming. The death rate worldwide continues to be high but has improved over recent decades because of early treatment, including use of oral rehydration therapy and improved nutrition and water sanitation measures. Most people recover completely without any complications as long as they avoid dehydration.",

Hypovolemia occurs when the extracellular fluid volume is reduced, leading to a shift in intravascular volume, and when severe can cause reduction in tissue perfusion. If significant salt and water loss occurring through diarrhea and vomiting is not replaced, the patient becomes hypovolemic. Thus, patients with severe viral gastroenteritis with a fever, profuse diarrhea, and minimal fluid intake can present with volume depletion evidenced by poor skin turgor, tachycardia, orthostatic changes, and elevated plasma sodium concentration.

Oral rehydration was the focus of a study by Rao and colleagues9 examining the efficacy, safety, and palatability of Pedialyte, Gatorade, and a New Oral Rehydration Solution (N-ORS) in an adult population with mild to moderate viral gastroenteritis. This randomized double-blind trial took place in a hospital setting, where they measured stool and urine output, fluid intake, body weight, electrolytes, hematocrit, and palatability. The results showed improved stool frequency, consistency, and body weight in all 3 groups, without differences among groups. All other parameters were similar. Subjects with normal electrolytes on admission were able to maintain them throughout the study, but those with hypokalemia or hyponatremia in the Gatorade group were less likely to correct this imbalance.9 The authors state that this may be a skewed result because the Gatorade group had a higher percentage of hyponatremic and hypokalemic subjects than the other groups. The subjects preferred the taste of the Gatorade and the N-ORS versus the Pedialyte. The authors discuss the importance of this finding, because a sport drink such as Gatorade tends to be relatively less expensive, available in most convenience stores, and well tolerated by the public. Therefore, Gatorade may be effective in helping to treat dehydration associated with mild viral gastroenteritis.

Volunteers were inoculated with norovirus and evaluated.
