COVID-19 patients are usually asymptomatic but could clinically manifest with flu-like symptoms like fever, fatigue, dry cough, anorexia, myalgia and dyspnea. In severe cases, it can progress to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and death. 2, 3 Emerging studies have also demonstrated hypercoagulable states and Kawasaki disease as possible complications of COVID-19. 4, 5 Researchers in Wuhan have found death rates to be around 1%. 6 The risk increases in patients who are older, male or who have other comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and chronic lung diseases. 7 As of 04 May 2020, the total number of confirmed deaths stands at 239,604. 8 Till date, there is no definite treatment that has proven to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19. Remdesivir developed by GILEAD is one of the more promising medications for the treatment of COVID-19. A recent study done by Chinese researchers showed that patients did not benefit clinically from Remdesivir. 9 It was however, refuted to be an underpowered trial which resulted in inconclusive findings. 10 With the exponential rise in patients around the world, healthcare providers are under immense pressure to find a possible treatment to speed up the recovery of the patients and prevent a possible collapse of the healthcare system.",

TCM has been utilized with success in several reports for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. 12 More recently, a new class of herbal formulations known as San Yao San Fang (SYSF) (\u4e09\u836f\u4e09\u65b9) has been gaining widespread use for treatment in China. SYSF refers to 3 existing formulas (San Yao) that are thought to be effective in the management of COVID-19 and 3 new formulations (San Fang) created during this pandemic for the treatment of COVID-19. San Yao includes 1. Jin Hua Qing Gan Ke Li (Formula J) (\u91d1\u82b1\u6e05\u611f\u9897\u7c92), 13 2. Lian Hua Qing Wen Jiao Nang (Formula L) (\u8fde \u82b1\u6e05\u761f\u80f6\u56ca) 14,15 and 3.

However, there is a significant difference in regards to adverse events experienced by the treatment group. 32.39% of the patients in the treatment group developed diarrhea symptoms in this study, as compared to 0% of patients in the control group experiencing adverse events. This may be due to the high dose of Formula J used in this study (2 sachets of 5g each time, 3 times a day), as compared to the usual dose of 1 sachet of 5g each time, 3 times a day. 32 There is no research comparison of the degree of adverse reactions caused by high and low doses of Formula J, and whether diarrhea is an adverse reaction of Formula J is still to be further discussed. Although Formula J may meet current treatment needs, it should be pointed out that there are still deficiencies as patients in the study were not treated according to syndrome differentiation. Treatment using Formula J based on syndrome differentiation is a potential direction for further research.",

Importantly, Lv et al showed no statistical difference in terms of adverse events between the treatment and control groups. The adverse events that patients in the treatment group experienced are diarrhoea and loss of appetite which subsequently resolved with the stoppage of the management plan, with no long term sequelae.

Both papers reported a high degree of heterogeneity when comparing the duration of hospitalisation between the treatment and control group. This review is limited by the lack of randomised control trials and prospective studies for each formula in SYSF. This is expected due to the ongoing and sudden pandemic of COVID-19, making trials difficult to conduct due to the lack of manpower available. This is compounded by new formulas that have been specifically concocted for COVID-19. As such, a mixed method review was employed, analysing both prospective and retrospective studies with a comparator. Even though there is high heterogeneity among the analysed papers due to different formulas being studied, we can use these papers to understand the overall effects of SYSF on patients with COVID-19 from multiple angles.",
