            "text": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a key role in the regulation of T cell homoeostasis and self-tolerance. While mice that lack IL-2 (Il-2\n\u2212/\u2212) are not immunosuppressed, they exhibit a number of phenotypes that point to immunological dysfunction (Schorle et al., 1991). Serum IgM levels are unaffected, but IgG1 levels are suppressed >20-fold, suggesting impaired CD4+ T cell helper function, despite no overt change in the profile of the major T cell compartments in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid tissues. Similarly, Il-2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice recover from infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) despite a significant reduction (up to 90%) in the generation of virus-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (Cousens et al., 1995, Kundig et al., 1993). However, the absence of IL-2 results in the inability to mount an effective secondary response, a reflection of the failure of memory cell expansion upon challenge (D'Souza and Lefrancois, 2003, Williams et al., 2006). Paradoxically, over time, a lack of IL-2 is associated with the development of a fatal, multi-organ autoimmune disease, characterised by the polyclonal activation of B and T cells, and the production of autoantibodies (Sadlack et al., 1995, Sadlack et al., 1993). This lack of immunological self-tolerance has been identified as being caused by the absence of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells, the development of which is IL-2-dependent (Almeida et al., 2002, Malek et al., 2002, Papiernik et al., 1998). Collectively, these and many other studies have elucidated the pivotal role played by IL-2 in regulating both the effector and regulatory arms of T cell biology (Boyman and Sprent, 2012).",

            "text": "The primary source of IL-2 is activated CD4+ T cells, although a variety of other cell types including dendritic, mast and CD8+ T cells may secrete IL-2 in response to different stimuli (Boyman and Sprent, 2012). The high-affinity cell-surface receptor for IL-2 comprises three proteins \u2013 IL-2R\u03b1 (CD25), IL-2R\u03b2(CD122) and the common \u03b3-chain (\u03b3-c or CD132) \u2013 and is expressed on antigen-activated and regulatory T cells (Malek and Castro, 2010). The receptor subunits IL-2R\u03b2 and \u03b3-c can form a dimer that binds IL-2 with moderate affinity and signal in the absence of the IL-2R\u03b1 subunit (Boyman et al., 2006); nonetheless, the high-affinity, trimeric receptor complex is essential for the development of T cell homoeostasis in vivo, as mice that lack the IL-2R\u03b1 subunit are phenotypically indistinguishable from IL-2-deficient mice (Willerford et al., 1995). The sequential assembly of the functional ligand-receptor signalling complex has been elucidated at a structural level, with the initial formation of an IL-2:IL-2R\u03b1 dimer providing a discrete interface for the recruitment of the IL-2R\u03b2 subunit, with no contact being made between the respective receptor partners (Stauber et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2005). Within this trimeric complex, IL-2 and IL-2R\u03b2 provide a composite interface for the recruitment of the \u03b3-c receptor. At a cellular level, the formation of the quaternary signalling complex results in the activation of two members of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK3, and signal transduction via a number of canonical pathways (Boyman and Sprent, 2012).",

Only a handful of cell-surface markers for different cell types are available (Music et al., 2014), while the quantitation of immune cytokines is determined only by their relative mRNA levels rather than protein levels (Carolan et al., 2014). There is virtually no information on the use of ferret-specific or ferret cross-reactive growth additives or differentiation factors for ferret cell culture. With the recent publication of the ferret genome (Peng et al., 2014) it is hoped that the flow of reagents will increase so that much more sophisticated studies can be undertaken to follow or prevent infection. Here we describe the expression, activity and crystal structure of ferret recombinant IL-2 and show that while it has similarities to human IL-2, it retains some unique features that presumably have evolved with the species.",

Recombinant IL-2 was purified from 1.6 L of conditioned medium by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC; 5 mL HisTRAP HP column, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) followed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) under conditions to minimise endotoxin contamination. Endotoxin levels were measured by the Endosafe\u2013PTS assay (Charles River, USA) and were of the order of 1.90 units/mg of protein.",

Structural superposition gave a root mean square deviation of 1.38 \u00c5 for 109 corresponding C\u03b1 atoms out of a total of 126. However, notable structural re-arrangements are observed when comparing the two structures. The second helix in molecule 1 is bent in the middle so that the helix is divided into helices B and B\u2032 (Fig. 2A). Such a bent helix is an invariable feature observed in all human IL-2 structures solved to date, no matter whether the human IL-2 is in the apo state or in complexes with the receptors (Fig. 2C) (Arkin et al., 2003, Bazan, 1992, Rickert et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2005). In contrast, in molecule 2 of the ferret IL-2 structure, helices B and B\u2032 form one straightened helix, which results from the shifting of helix A\u2032 towards the original position of helix B\u2032 (Fig. 2B). Examination of the crystal structure indicates that the movement of the helix A\u2032 was caused by the approach of helix C from a neighbouring molecule due to packing contacts in the crystal. As a result of the structural adjustment, the loop regions in the middle of the two long links in molecule 2 reorganized to form an anti-parallel two-stranded \u03b2-sheet (Fig. 2B). Superposition of the two ferret IL-2 structures onto that of human IL-2 (Arkin et al., 2003) revealed root mean square deviations of 1.66 \u00c5 for 113 C\u03b1 atoms and 1.90 \u00c5 for 102 C\u03b1 atoms, for molecule 1 and 2, respectively, corroborating that the structure of molecule 1 is more similar to that of human IL-2 (Fig. 2C).",

            "text": "It has been suggested that the kink of the second helix of human IL-2 is caused by the proline residue Pro65 (Brandhuber et al., 1987). A distorted helix is energetically unfavourably and often caused by the existence of the proline residue as the cyclic structure of the side chain limits the conformational flexibility of the protein backbone (Piela et al., 1987). The complex structure of human IL-2 with its \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3c receptors revealed that helices A\u2032 and B\u2032 (see Fig. 3\n) and their neighbouring regions contribute the major interactions to form a \u201clow affinity\u201d complex with the alpha chain receptor as the first step of complex formation before the recruitment of the beta and gamma chains (Wang et al., 2005). The bound IL-2 structure in complex with the alpha chain receptor is very similar to that of its unbound state with only minor structural adaptations observed, including the partial unwinding of the first and last turn of helix A\u2032 and the last turn of helix B\u2032 (Bazan, 1992). The well-preserved overall structure suggests that human IL-2 maintains an active conformation even in the apo state, ready to forge binding interactions with the receptor. A similar structure is observed for ferret IL-2 molecule 1, indicating the conservation of these critical functional domains. In contrast, ferret IL-2 displays greater structural flexibility as shown by the conformational change in molecule 2, induced by an approaching molecule due to crystal packing. The movement of helices A\u2032 and B\u2032 in molecule 2 of ferret IL-2 may certainly disrupt the spatial arrangement of the residues involved in receptor binding interactions. It was shown in human IL-2 that residues Phe42, Tyr45 and Leu72 form critical hydrophobic interactions with the alpha chain receptor. Again, the corresponding residues are conserved in ferret IL-2 (Fig. 3), confirming their functional importance for engagement of the IL-2R\u03b1, although their spatial positions are shifted in molecule 2 due to the movement of helices A\u2032 and B\u2032. Structural alignment of ferret molecule 2 onto human IL-2 in the complex structure with the alpha chain receptor indicated that inter-atomic steric conflicts would occur between the straightened helix B\u2032 and the receptor.",

This replacement is probably the reason that leads to the increased conformational flexibility observed in the ferret IL-2 structure compared to the human IL2. This conformational flexibility may thus represent an intrinsic property of ferret IL-2 and structural adjustment can occur when induced by other molecules as shown above. While the bent helix may be necessary to maintain the receptor binding residues in the correct configuration, the varied structures suggest that unlike human IL-2, different states of the molecule may exist for ferret IL-2, which may implicate subtle differences between the two species IL-2's when initiating their biological functions.",

We have previously shown that ferret lymphocytes respond to mitogens and produce similar cytokines and chemokines as mouse and human cells (Carolan et al., 2014), thus we assessed whether recombinant ferret IL-2 proteins could stimulate ferret lymphocytes in vitro. Dose-dependent induction of mRNAs for the immune mediators, Granzyme A (Fig. 4B) and IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4C), was observed when ferret LN cells were cultured with ferret and human recombinant IL-2. Cells cultured with the ferret IL-2 monomer produced the highest levels of the immune mediators, with a plateau at 1 and 10 \u03bcg/ml, respectively (Fig. 4B and C). The recombinant ferret proteins were not detected by ELISAs specific for mouse or human IL-2 (data not shown). This is a particularly relevant observation in the context of the aims of the present study; ferret IL-2 shares varying degrees of homology with the corresponding human (74.8% amino acid identity) and mouse (58.6%) proteins, as demonstrated by the observed structural variations in the case of the human and ferret alignment. While there may be a high degree of functional redundancy between these species with respect to in vitro assays, this does not extend to immunological cross-reactivity, at least in the kits tested in this study. This highlights the need to develop ferret-specific antibody reagents, not only for IL-2 but also for the broader suite of cytokines and lymphocyte cell-surface markers, in order to fully realise the value of the ferret as the most appropriate animal model for enhancing our understanding of the immunobiology of the host response following infection with a number of lethal, human viral pathogens, including influenza.",
