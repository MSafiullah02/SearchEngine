With the increasing number of people suspected of being infected, an inadequate number of RT-PCR kits is inevitable. Several studies have demonstrated the higher sensitivity of CT than RT-PCR in detecting COVID-19 infected patients (7). The high incidence of infected individuals in countries such as Iran, and the importance of pulmonary changes through the course of the disease demonstrate that chest CT is superior to RT-PCR (6). Due to the increasing number of chest CT scan requests by physicians and the need to reduce the risks of ionizing radiation a dose reduction protocol is needed which can be used with devices from different manufacturers.",

Our protocol was developed to work with all CT scanners with 4 or more detectors and is defined for each manufacturer and model. Our primary goal of screening and evaluation is to detect COVID-19 infection in patients with highly suspicious clinical conditions and laboratory findings according to the ministry of health protocol. Therefore, the primary task is to detect ground glass opacities in the typical subpleural location. To reduce thoracic motion, the CT scan is to be performed in one breath-hold. The slice thickness of slices is 1-3 mm. Coronal and sagittal reconstructions would be optional. Maximum intensity projections as used for lung nodules is not mandatory. Neither oral nor intravenous contrast is used. The patient is supine, in the center of the gantry, with arms above the head. Images are obtained through the entire thorax. All patients are instructed to hold his and/or her breath at the end of inspiration during the entire scan. Suggested parameters to minimize the radiation dose are as follow: Kvp: 100-120, mAs: 50-100, Pitch: 0.8-1.5, Thickness: 1-3 mm. To conclude, low dose HRCT might have more advantages than RT-PCR especially in highly infected society with low availability of PCR-kits.",
