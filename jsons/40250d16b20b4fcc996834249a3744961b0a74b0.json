M. Dixon, Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin-related (DC-SIGNR), also known as liver/lymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin, CLEC4M, CD209L, and CD299, is a Ca 2+ -dependent lectin that has been implicated in increasing the infection rates of several viruses, including HIV, but the physiological role of DC-SIGNR in healthy cells is currently not known with certainty. A close homologue of DC-SIGNR, dendritic-cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin, has been shown to act as a recycling endocytic receptor, which binds pathogens at the cell's surface and then releases them in the low pH environment of endosomal compartments. However, it is currently under debate in the literature as to whether DC-SIGNR plays a similar role. In this work, we used NMR to explore whether the DC-SIGNR carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) shows any pH dependence in its ability to bind carbohydrates and Ca 2+ . We found clear evidence of reduced or abolished CRD-binding affinities for three different glycans at low pH (4.2) as compared to neutral pH (6.8). We also report the assignment of the DC-SIGNR CRD in the apo form, and use these new results to characterize the degree of structural rearrangement upon binding (or release) of Ca 2+ . Finally, we report a differential effect of pH on the affinities of glycans containing mannose exclusively versus glycans containing GlcNAc moieties. Our results lead us to propose that the DC-SIGNR CRD rapidly and reversibly releases glycan ligands and Ca 2+ at reduced pH (behaviour that would be expected for an endocytic receptor), and that the binding of mannose-containing oligosaccharides is more strongly affected by pH than the binding of GlcNAc-containing oligosaccharides.",

Although the complete physiological role of DC-SIGNR is not known in full, it has been shown to have roles in cell adhesion [8] and cell signalling [9] , and may also be involved in initiating the primary immune response through binding to intercellular adhesion molecule 3 on resting T lymphocytes [10] .

            "text": "It has been shown that several C-type lectins, including DC-SIGN and the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor [12] [13] [14] , act as recycling endocytic receptors. These proteins bind glycosylated ligands and pathogens at the cell surface, internalize them, and then release them into the low-pH (~4.5-5.5) environment of endosomal compartments and phagolysosomes. The internalized ligands and pathogens are processed for antigen presentation and/or degraded completely before the endocytic receptor is recycled back to the cell surface for further ligand capture [15] [16] [17] [18] . Despite sharing 77% sequence identity with DC-SIGN, it is currently under debate as to whether the related protein DC-SIGNR (expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells found in the liver and also on selected lymphatic endothelium, placental capillary and epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract) is a recycling endocytic receptor. Studies of immobilized DC-SIGNR failed to show reduced binding of 125 I-labelled mannose (Man) 30 -BSA at low pH or internalization and degradation of this ligand by DC-SIGNR-transfected Rat-6 fibroblasts [17] . Furthermore, DC-SIGNR contains only one of the two sequence motifs (a dileucine/triacidic cluster motif and Y-XX-\u03a6 motif, where \u03a6 is a hydrophobic residue [12] ) proposed to direct localization of DC-SIGN into endocytic vesicles (only the dileucine motif is conserved in DC-SIGNR). As a result, some authors argue that DC-SIGNR has evolved to perform different (as yet not fully characterized) biological functions from DC-SIGN that do not necessarily involve ligand internalization, such as cell adhesion and leukocyte rolling.",

In the absence of this assignment, a qualitative illustration of the regions affected by the reduction in pH is given in Fig. 1B . In Fig. 1B , the residues that showed clearly detectable chemical shift changes upon a reduction of the pH were mapped onto the crystal structure of the CRD [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 1K9J], and are shown in red (white regions are residues whose chemical shifts remained unchanged). This analysis suggests that both Ca 2+ -binding loops (the primary loop containing residues 359-364, and the secondary loop containing residues 344-355), a-helix 1 (residues 288-298), and b-sheets 6 and 7 (residues 368-372 and 375-379) undergo changes in their fold and/or dynamics at low pH. These regions of the protein form part of the proposed glycan-binding site, and so it is possible that changes in fold and/or dynamics at low pH may modulate glycan binding. Given that the homologous protein DC-SIGN is known to be an endocytic receptor, the most likely explanation for these results is that the DC-SIGNR CRD releases Ca 2+ at low pH. Furthermore, these pH-induced changes to the HSQC spectrum of the CRD are reversible: increasing the pH back to 6.8 yielded an HSQC spectrum identical to the black spectrum shown in Fig. 1A . This type of behaviour would be expected for an endocytic receptor that is required to regain its ligand-binding ability as it is recycled back to the cell surface.",

            "text": "To investigate whether the changes in the CRD at low pH resulted from release of bound Ca 2+ , we attempted to prepare a sample of the CRD in its apo form (Ca 2+ -free) by excluding Ca 2+ from all reagents and water during expression. EDTA was then used as a probe to confirm that no Ca 2+ was present. EDTA can be used to probe the presence of Ca 2+ in solution by NMR, as the 1D/ 1 H-spectra of free and Ca 2+bound EDTA can be easily distinguished [20, 21] . Free EDTA results in two sharp singlet peaks resulting from the acetate-methylene and amine-methylene protons (labelled 1 and 2, respectively, in Fig. 2A ). Ca 2+ binding causes splitting of the acetate-methylene proton peak, whereas a singlet remains for the aminemethylene protons (Fig. 2B ). In the Ca 2+ -bound form, both peaks are shifted upfield with respect to the free EDTA chemical shifts. Consequently, the addition of EDTA has been used previously to screen for the presence of Ca 2+ in solution [22] ). Figure 2A shows the 1 H-spectrum of the apo-CRD after addition of excess EDTA. Only peaks resulting from free EDTA are observed. Given the strong affinity of EDTA for Ca 2+ , it was expected that EDTA would compete with the CRD for calcium ions if any were present in the apo-CRD sample. This was confirmed by addition of increasing concentrations of EDTA to a sample of the holo-CRD (Fig. 2B ,C), which resulted in peaks attributable to Ca 2+ -bound EDTA. The presence of only free EDTA peaks in Fig. 2A suggests that the CRD is in the apo form and that no Ca 2+ is present. Figure 3 shows a partial assignment of the apo-CRD. Unfortunately, the variable intensity of the apo-CRD HSQC spectrum (most likely a result of the dynamic nature of the CRD in the absence of Ca 2+ ) prevented complete assignment. Nevertheless, the assignments for the apo-CRD have been deposited at the BMRB (ID 25046) and compared with our previously published values for the holo-CRD (BMRB ID 19297 [19] ) in Fig. 4 . Figure 4A shows a comparison of the HSQC spectra of the apo-CRD (black spectrum) and holo-CRD (red spectrum) at pH 6.8. It is clear that substantial chemical shift changes occur throughout the spectrum, suggesting a conformational change that is directly associated with Ca 2+ binding. In addition, some of the signals in the A B C Fig. 2 . 1D 1 H-spectra obtained with (A) addition of EDTA to the apo-CRD, (B) addition of EDTA to the holo-CRD, and (C) addition of excess EDTA to the holo-CRD. All spectra were recorded at pH 6.8. EDTA can be used to probe for the presence of Ca 2+ , as the 1D spectra of free and Ca 2+ -bound EDTA are easily identified. Assignments are mapped onto the EDTA structure, and the pH was kept constant for all spectra. Addition of EDTA to the apo-CRD (A) produced only free EDTA peaks, confirming that there was no Ca 2+ present, and that the protein was indeed in the apo-form. In contrast, addition of EDTA to the holo-CRD (B) produced only Ca 2+ -bound EDTA peaks, as the free Ca 2+ interacts with EDTA. Addition of excess EDTA to the holo-CRD (C) resulted in the appearance of additional free EDTA peaks. Fig. 3 . Assignment of the apo-CRD (Ca 2+free) at pH 6.8. Partial assignment of the apo-CRD HSQC spectrum at pH 6.8. The absence of Ca 2+ was confirmed by addition of EDTA, showing that the CRD was indeed in the apo form. Fig. 4 . (A) HSQC spectra of the apo-CRD at pH 6.8 (black), the holo-CRD at pH 6.8 (red), and the holo-CRD at pH 4.2 (blue). It is clear from the HSQC spectra that substantial chemical shift perturbations occurred throughout the CRD upon binding of Ca 2+ (i.e. upon addition of 4 mM Ca 2+ ). In addition, the spectrum of the apo-CRD is broader than that of the holo-CRD, suggesting a change in dynamics upon Ca 2+ binding. Comparison of the HSQC spectra of the apo-CRD at pH 6.8 and the holo-CRD at pH 4.2 indicates that reduction of the pH does not generate the Ca 2+ -free, apo form, but instead produces an additional, distinct species that may represent a 'Ca 2+ -depleted' form or multiple species. These two spectra do show a similar pattern of peaks (circled) that we have interpreted to be aliased arginine side chain peaks in very similar chemical environments. (B) Total chemical shift perturbation per residue (Dd total ; see Experimental procedures) observed upon removal of Ca 2+ (comparing apo-CRD and holo-CRD 1 H and 15 N chemical shifts) at pH 6.8. Peaks that have moved/broadened so significantly as to prevent their assignment in the apo-CRD spectrum are represented with a maximum perturbation of 0.3. apo-CRD spectrum are severely broadened as compared with the holo-CRD spectrum, suggesting dynamics on the intermediate NMR timescale. The addition of Ca 2+ reduces this variable intensity. Figure 4B shows the total chemical shift perturbation per residue (Dd total ; see Experimental procedures) upon removal of Ca 2+ . In this plot, peaks that have moved/broadened so significantly as to prevent their assignment in the apo-CRD are represented in Fig. 4B with a maximum perturbation of 0.3. This value was assigned arbitrarily to highlight the residues that were most strongly affected by removal of Ca 2+ , but were not amenable to calculation of Dd total . Unsurprisingly, these results demonstrate that removal of Ca 2+ affects the entire CRD structure. As Ca 2+ is required for glycan binding to DC-SIGNR, it is reasonable to conclude that these conformational/dynamic changes are instrumental in increasing the affinity of the CRD for ligands.",

These two spectra are also quite distinct from one another, but they do show a similar pattern of peaks that only appear in the apo-CRD spectrum or at low pH in the holo-CRD spectrum (they are absent in the holo-CRD spectrum at pH 6.8). These peaks (circled and labelled in Fig. 4A ) are likely to be aliased arginine side chain peaks. Given that the pH range investigated here was low enough to stabilize protonation of the arginine side chain (pK a = 12.5), these results suggest that the side chain NH groups in six of the nine arginines in the protein have very similar chemical environments (as shown by their similar 1 H and 15 N chemical shifts) in the apo-CRD at pH 6.8 and the holo-CRD at pH 4.2. Despite these similarities, the differences in chemical shift and peak intensities of these two spectra indicate that a reduction of the pH does not simply remove all calcium ions to yield the apo-CRD, but may produce a 'Ca 2+ -depleted' form or multiple species (e.g. apo, holo, and Ca 2+ depleted) of the CRD in exchange with one another, but more work is needed to confirm this.",

The pH was adjusted, and a 1 H/ 15 N-HSQC spectrum was acquired after each addition of glycan. Because carbohydrates are weak acids with pK a values ranging from 12 to 14 [23] , and a reduction of the pH from 6.8 to 4.2 would therefore not affect the glycan protonation state, any changes in the HSQC spectrum upon reduction in pH were attributed to the pH dependence of the CRD. Figure 5 shows an overlay of the glycan-free spectrum (black) at pH 4.2 and the spectrum obtained after addition of 5 mM Man 3 (green) to a 0.4 mM solution of the CRD at the same pH. Even at this concentration of Man 3 , which was the highest tested and represents a 12.5-fold molar excess of Man 3 with respect to the CRD, no change in the HSQC spectrum was observed at pH 4.2. This is in contrast to our previous results obtained at pH 6.8, where Man 3 binding resulted in several significant and obvious chemical shift perturbations (see Fig. S4 in [19] ), and confirms that Man 3 does not bind to the CRD at pH 4.2. The ability of the CRD to release Man at low pH was investigated further by binding the CRD to a 2-mL Man-Sepharose column at neutral pH (pH 7.8) (see Experimental procedures) and eluting either with EDTA ( Fig. 6A ) or with reduction of the pH to 4.2 in an EDTA-free buffer (Fig. 6B) . In both cases, SDS/PAGE confirmed that DC-SIGNR dissociated from the mannosylated resin and eluted from the column. Although the rate of dissociation varied (EDTA yielded rapid elution of the CRD, whereas low pH results in slower elution into more fractions), the results clearly demonstrate that reducing the pH greatly lowers the affinity of the CRD for Man.",

Upon addition of a 14-fold molar excess of GlcNAc 2 Man 3 to a 0.7 mM solution of the CRD, a small number of chemical shift changes were observed as compared with the holo-CRD HSQC spectrum at pH 4.2, and these regions are circled in Fig. 5 . However, the number of perturbations was far fewer than observed at pH 6.8 (see Fig. S3 in [19] for comparison). These results suggest that, although binding of Glc-NAc 2 Man 3 is not completely abolished at low pH, as is the case for Man 3 , the affinity is greatly reduced. A third ligand, GlcNAc 3 , which was not included in our previous study, was investigated here for the first time to determine whether the differences in pH sensitivity could be traced to the GlcNAc moiety of GlcNAc 2 Man 3 . First, binding of GlcNAc 3 to the CRD was confirmed at near-neutral pH by titrating increasing concentrations of GlcNAc 3 (up to 10 mM, 14-fold molar excess) into a 0.7 mM 15 N-labelled CRD sample at pH 6.8. Significant chemical shift perturbations were observed in several regions of the HSQC spectrum, confirming GlcNAc 3 binding (see Fig. 7A for perturbation results), and these mapped to regions of the CRD that agree well with our previous results [see Fig. 7B for mapping of significant perturbations onto the crystal structure of the CRD (PDB ID 1K9K)]. The chemical shift perturbations were fitted to a single-site binding model (Fig. 7C) as described previously [19] , yielding a K D of 3.58 AE 0.66 mM. This is approximately double the K D of Man-containing glycans measured with the same method, which all ranged from 1.5 mM to 2.2 mM. Figure 5 shows an overlay of the HSQC spectra of the holo-CRD (black) and the CRD after addition of 10 mM GlcNAc 3 (blue) at pH 4.2. The size and number of perturbations are very similar to those observed for GlcNAc 2 Man 3 . Taken together, these data suggest that the binding of Man to the CRD is more sensitive to pH than the binding of GlcNAc moieties; however, binding of all three glycans studied here appears to be significantly impaired at low pH. to the CRD at low pH yielded no changes in the CRD spectrum, suggesting that Man binding to the CRD is pH-dependent. Some small perturbations were observed upon addition of GlcNAc 2 Man 3 and GlcNAc 3 at low pH, and suggest that binding of the CRD to the GlcNAc moiety may not be completely abolished at low pH.

The majority of the protein was eluted in fraction 2, although small amounts of protein were also detected in other fractions, as well as in the wash (W). (B) In an equivalent experiment, the CRD was also eluted from the column with an EDTA-free buffer (same as above) adjusted to pH 4.2. The majority of the protein was eluted in fraction 3, confirming that the CRD is capable of releasing ligand at low pH. As observed in (A), there appeared to be a small amount of residual protein in subsequent fractions, as well as in the wash (W).",

            "text": "In this study, we have demonstrated that, in the absence of glycan ligands, decreasing the pH of the holo-CRD from 6.8 to 4.2 causes substantial changes throughout the HSQC spectrum (i.e. both chemical shift changes and variable intensity of peaks), suggestive of a structural rearrangement. This structural rearrangement is as yet uncharacterized, mainly because of difficulties arising from variable intensity in these spectra, which we are currently trying to overcome. We suggest that this structural rearrangement could be attributable to the release of bound calcium ions, as it is well known that the CRD has three structurally important bound calcium ions that stabilize the CRD structure and contribute to glycan binding [24] . However, our data clearly show that reduction of the pH does not simply generate the apo (Ca 2+ -free) form of the CRD, but instead produces a new species (see Fig. 8 for a summary of the species observed in this study), which we have tentatively attributed to a 'Ca 2+ -depleted' form of the CRD. DC-SIGNR, like many C-type lectins, is known to bind a primary Ca 2+ with higher affinity than the two secondary calcium ions. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that reducing the pH causes the protein to release the lower-affinity calcium ions, while binding to the higher-affinity, primary Ca 2+ may remain. The loss of these secondary calcium ions may explain the reduced/ abolished glycan binding. This 'Ca 2+ -depleted' form of the protein has a conformation and dynamics that are distinct from those of the apo form and holo form at near-neutral pH, and is the predominant species in solution at pH 4.2 in either the presence or the absence of the glycan. (1) in Experimental procedures. The dashed horizontal line represents the 1 9 standard deviation cut-off for the dataset, above which a change was considered to be significant. (B) Chemical shift perturbations upon binding of GlcNAc 3 mapped onto the CRD crystal structure. Residues showing chemical shift perturbations above the 1 9 standard deviation cut-off (see dashed line) are shown in red on the CRD crystal structure (PDB ID 1K9J). These agree well with the regions of the CRD that responded most strongly to binding of the small glycans (Man 3 , Man 5 , and GlcNAc 2 Man 3 ) previously reported, namely a-helix 2, b-strands 6 and 7, and both Ca 2+ -binding loops. (C) The total chemical shift perturbation per residue (Dd total ) is plotted against glycan concentration, and fitted to a single-site binding model. All significantly perturbed residues fit the same single-site model, but here only three residues in a-helix 2 (a proposed binding site for small glycan fragments) are shown as an illustration. The fit was used to calculate the dissociation constant of the CRD for GlcNAc 3 .",

All three of these ligands have K D values in the range of 1.5-3.5 mM at pH 6.8, but yield minimal or no chemical shift changes for peaks in the CRD HSQC-spectrum at low pH, even upon titration of a 12-14-fold molar excess of ligand (thus preventing any attempts to quantify binding constants at pH 4.2 by using NMR chemical shifts). For example, stepwise titration of excess Man 3 into a low-pH (pH 4.2) sample of 15 N-labelled DC-SIGNR produced no chemical shift perturbations, indicating that binding of Man 3 to the CRD is abolished at low pH. These NMRbased results were largely supported by the successful elution of the CRD from a Man-Sepharose column in pH 4.2 buffer containing no EDTA. This observed reduction in glycan binding at low pH provides the first atomic-resolution evidence supporting the hypothesis that DC-SIGNR has a role as an endocytic receptor [15, 16] , like its homologue DC-SIGN. This is consistent with the presence of DC-SIGNR in abundance on the surfaces of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, which are highly specialized cells that are unusual among vascular endothelial cell types for their high capacity to internalize materials for immunological processing, with proximity to large hepatic repositories of T lymphocytes [25] .",

            "text": "In our low-pH glycan-CRD binding studies, we did observe a small number of chemical shift changes upon addition of an excess of GlcNAc-containing glycans (namely GlcNAc 2 Man 3 and GlcNAc 3 ), although these perturbations were not as pronounced as those seen at pH 6.8. These results were in contrast to our observations upon addition of Man 3 , which did not yield any chemical shift changes, and suggest that the binding of Man to the CRD is more sensitive to pH than binding of GlcNAc moieties. A possible explanation for this difference in binding at low pH between Man and GlcNAc moieties is that there are slight differences in the binding sites of the glycans studied here. Indeed, there are slight differences between the regions of the protein that are significantly perturbed by Man-containing glycans (see Fig. 5 in [19] ) and those that are perturbed by GlcNAc 3 (Fig. 5B ). In addition, the crystal structure 1K9J shows that the GlcNAc moiety (and not Man) forms coordination bonds with the primary Ca 2+ . If we assume that the higher-affinity primary Ca 2+ remains bound to DC-SIGNR at low pH, this may explain why GlcNAc binding is not completely abolished at low pH (although it is drastically reduced). Although the differences between DC-SIGNR binding to Man and to GlcNAc at low pH are quite subtle, these results are interesting, given recent work demonstrating that DC-SIGNR serves as an internalization receptor for von Willebrand factor (VWF), an important regulator of blood coagulation and a high molecular mass circulating glycoprotein [26] . These findings indicate a very important, endogenous role for DC-SIGNR in the removal of senescent glycoproteins from the circulation, most likely via the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium, as part of healthy homeostasis. Interestingly, the glycosylation profile of VWF shows a rich variety of GlcNAc-rich N-linked oligosaccharides and a scarcity of high-Man oligosaccharides [27] . The complete structural basis for DC-SIGNR binding to VWF is not known, but it would appear likely that engagement of appropriate clusters of GlcNAc-rich glycans would predominate. The observed retention of a small degree of GlcNAc-rich ligand binding at lower pH, in contrast to glycans composed exclusively of Man, may affect the fate of different glycoprotein ligands internalized via DC-SIGNR. Those released earlier at weakly acidic pH may traffic to early endosomes, whereas tighter-binding glycoproteins may traffic to late endosomes/lysosomes for complete degradation. This raises the possibility that DC-SIGNR can serve Fig. 8 . Schematic representation of the data described in this paper and the CRD species that have been observed. The different shapes represent the HSQC spectra of the CRD under different conditions, and where changes in 1 H and 15 N chemical shifts are observed. As indicated, the HSQC spectra of the holo-CRD and the glycan-bound CRD at low pH are very similar (and, in the case of Man 3 binding, identical), suggesting a similar fold and extremely weak (or no) glycan binding, as would be expected for an endocytic receptor.",
