Metagenomic sequencing is a promising solution for studying viral communities, but the lack of standardized methods currently precludes comparisons across host taxa or localities. Here, we developed an untargeted shotgun metagenomic sequencing protocol to generate comparable viral communities from noninvasively collected faecal and oropharyngeal swabs. Using samples from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus), a key species for virus transmission to humans and domestic animals, we tested how different storage media, nucleic acid extraction procedures and enrichment steps affect viral community detection.",

We recommend extracting nucleic acid directly from swabs rather than from supernatant or pelleted material, which had undetectable levels of viral RNA. Results from a low-input RNA library preparation protocol suggest that ribosomal RNA depletion and light DNase treatment reduce host and bacterial nucleic acid, and improve virus detection. Finally, applying our approach to twelve pooled samples from seven localities in Peru, we showed that detected viral communities saturated at the attained sequencing depth, allowing unbiased comparisons of viral community composition. Future studies using the methods outlined here will elucidate the determinants of viral communities across host species, environments and time.",

For example, characterization by isolation and culturing is unsuitable for members of the microbial community that is difficult to grow in culture (Fancello, Raoult, & Desnues, 2012) . Serological tests of antibody presence are targeted towards specific taxa and can be difficult to interpret due to antibody cross-reactivity and inconsistent cut-off thresholds for positivity (Gilbert et al., 2013) . Molecular detection of nucleic acids by targeted PCR remains an important technique for sequencing specific genomic regions, but these approaches cannot identify all taxa present and are inappropriate for discovering new, highly divergent taxa as designing primers or probes requires prior knowledge of nucleotide sequences (Fancello et al., 2012; Temmam, Davoust, Berenger, Raoult, & Desnues, 2014) . In contrast, unbiased deep sequencing has the potential to capture a snapshot of microbial communities in a large number of samples without prior expectations about what taxa will be detected.",

In the field of ecology, theories developed at macro-organismal level have been tested in microbial communities, such as the cycling of predator and prey populations (Rodriguez-Brito et al., 2010) and the existence of elevational diversity gradients (Fierer et al., 2011) . Deep sequencing has also demonstrated that both bacterial and viral communities differ across abiotic environments (Dinsdale et al., 2008) in such diverse systems as soil bacteria (Fierer et al., 2012) and marine viruses (Hurwitz, Westveld, Brum, & Sullivan, 2014) . In the context of human and animal health, deep sequencing can identify candidate pathogens in unexplained disease (Briese et al., 2009; Cox-Foster et al., 2007; Honkavuori et al., 2008; Palacios et al., 2008) and potential hosts and vectors of emerging pathogens (Masembe et al., 2012; Veikkolainen, Vesterinen, Lilley, & Pulliainen, 2014; Volokhov et al., 2017) . Studies of host-associated microbial communities have revealed that microbes vary across body habitats, space and time (Blekhman et al., 2015; Costello et al., 2009) , and that a community-level perspective of hostassociated microbes is critical for understanding health and disease (Lecuit & Eloit, 2013; Vayssier-Taussat et al., 2014; Virgin, 2014) .",

Studies of bacterial communities frequently use 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) metabarcoding to examine highly multiplexed samples. However, viral communities lack a similarly conserved marker across or even within viral families (Mokili, Rohwer, & Dutilh, 2012; Rohwer & Edwards, 2002) and are therefore more commonly characterized using metagenomics. Although this approach is currently less cost-and time-efficient than metabarcoding for large numbers of samples, it can assign taxa at higher resolution (depending on factors such as read length, genomic region and reference database) and avoids PCR biases (Jovel et al., 2016) . Shotgun metagenomics also allows the simultaneous characterization of different microbial communities (e.g., bacterial and viral) (Chandler, Liu, & Bennett, 2015; Schneeberger et al., 2016) as well as host population structure and diet (Srivathsan, Ang, Vogler, & Meier, 2016) . Furthermore, metagenomics can detect viruses at or below the sensitivity of taxon-specific PCR and qPCR (Greninger et al., 2010; Li et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2011) , implying that broader taxonomic coverage does not necessarily trade off with sensitivity.",

VTM has historically been used to preserve samples when viruses are to be detected by PCR or cultured in vitro (e.g., Jensen & Johnson, 1994; Druce, Garcia, Tran, Papadakis, & Birch, 2012 another popular medium for storing microbial samples collected in the field (B\u00e1nyai et al., 2017; Drexler et al., 2011; Frick et al., 2017; Gomez et al., 2015) , as it preserves RNA without requiring immediate freezing. However, its high salt content, while not problematic for solid tissue samples, creates challenges for nucleic acid extraction from the kinds of noninvasive swab samples that are typical of ecological field studies (e.g., blood, urine, faeces and saliva). While viruses are often extracted from an aliquot of supernatant (Baker et al., 2013; Tse et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012) , extraction from the swab itself may be desirable for samples stored in RNAlater (Vo & Jedlicka, 2014) .

For this reason, samples are often enriched for viruses using methods including nuclease treatment, filtration of host/bacterial particles, density gradient centrifugation and removal of rRNA (Hall et al., 2014; Kleiner, Hooper, & Duerkop, 2015; Kohl et al., 2015) . DNase treatment is a well-established and effective method of enrichment (Allander, Emerson, Engle, Purcell, & Bukh, 2001) , while filtration and centrifugation are sometimes used but can bias the inferred viral community composition (Kleiner et al., 2015; Thurber, Haynes, Breitbart, Wegley, & Rohwer, 2009) and are impractical for ecological studies given the large numbers of samples typically processed and interest in generating community data rather than focusing on a particular pathogen. Depletion of host rRNA is unlikely to bias the viral community (He et al., 2010; Matranga et al., 2014) , but may affect the distribution of coverage across the viral genome (Li et al., 2016) .

These other components of samples could impact extraction and PCR efficiency, for example, by acting as a carrier to enhance RNA extraction or through the presence of compounds that can act as extraction or PCR inhibitors. However, rather than inoculate field-collected swabs, in which differences between sample types or between pathogen communities could introduce uncontrolled variation, we opted for \"clean\" mock swabs that would allow us to evaluate differences in viral detection between extraction methods. Our second test aimed to approximate the minimal detectable viral concentration by qPCR using this method, to assess repeatability and to estimate extraction efficiency using the cotton-tipped wooden base swabs and rayon-tipped aluminium base swabs used to collect samples in the field. RNA was extracted from swabs, converted into cDNA and quantified by qPCR as described above. Three extraction replicates were performed for each concentration from 10 6 to 10 3 copies/ml for cotton-tipped wooden base swabs, and three extraction replicates were performed for aluminium base swabs at 10 5 copies/ml.",

First, although contamination has not been well characterized in viral metagenomic studies, it is a known problem in bacterial community studies. Samples with low microbial biomass are particularly sensitive to contamination with other microbes, for example from DNA extraction kits (Salter et al., 2014) or ultrapure water (Laurence, Hatzis, & Brash, 2014) . Our protocol minimized this risk by pooling samples following extraction to increase the amount of target nucleic acid relative to potential reagent-derived contaminants in downstream steps. Second, noninvasive samples will only detect viruses that are actively shed in urine and faeces, thus may miss latent viruses that are sporadically shed, but might be detectable by sequencing organs from sacrificed animals (Amman et al., 2012) . Third, our protocol is not able to discriminate between viruses actively infecting hosts and transient viruses acquired from diet or the environment. Although some sources of bias are unavoidable, and it is likely that not all viral taxa in a given sample will be identified, the same is true of all studies in community ecology where exhaustive sampling is not possible (Gotelli & Colwell, 2001; Hughes, Hellmann, Ricketts, & Bohannan, 2001) , and we showed statistically that viral communities in our samples were adequately sampled ( Figure 6 ). Our approach yielded sufficient depth to confidently characterize viral communities at the viral family or genus level, while identification of species or strains might be achieved by further increasing read depths to generate longer contigs that could be more precisely assigned ( Figure 5 ).",

A standardized approach to viral metagenomics opens many potential avenues of research in disease and community ecology. For example, viral community data collected across multiple individuals, populations and species allow the investigation of ecological processes shaping host-associated viral community structure (Anthony et al., 2015; Olival et al., 2017) . Taxonomic and functional patterns of bacterial diversity across host species are influenced by diet and phylogeny (Ley et al., 2008; Muegge et al., 2011; Zepeda Mendoza et al., 2018) , but drivers of host-associated viral communities may be different. In humans, host-associated viral communities are stable over time within individuals, but highly variable between individuals (Minot et al., 2011; Reyes et al., 2010) . These observations suggest the potential to use viral communities as a host or environmental \"fingerprint\" to evaluate interactions between multiple hosts, or between hosts and environments, as has been proposed in humans and primates (Fierer et al., 2010; Franzosa et al., 2015; Stumpf et al., 2016) .",

As metagenomics becomes an ever more popular and powerful tool for viral ecology, use of standardized methods such as those developed here will be crucial for comparative insights from diverse host species and environments.

Finally, we apply our optimized protocol to field-collected samples to validate whether viral communities are reliably characterized at commonly attained depths of sequencing. 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 | Authorizations Bat capture and sampling methods were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Glasgow School of Medical Veterinary and Life Sciences (Ref081/15) and the Field sampling of common vampire bats Common vampire bats were captured at 16 sites in seven departments (administrative regions) across Peru (Figure 1) between 2015 and 2016. Roosts were either natural (caves, trees) or man-made structures (abandoned houses, tunnels, mines) inhabited by bats. Bats were captured within roosts using hand nets or while they exited roosts using mist nets and harp traps. For nocturnal captures, nets were open from approximately 18:00-6:00 and checked every 30 min; a combination of one to three mist nets and one harp trap was used depending on the size and number of roost exits identified. When exact roost locations were unknown, bats were captured while foraging at livestock pens using mist nets. Upon capture, bats were placed into individual cloth holding bags before being processed and sampled. Bats were also given a uniquely numbered wing band (3.5 mm incoloy, Porzana Inc) for identification of recaptures in ongoing longitudinal studies. Oropharyngeal (saliva) samples were collected by allowing bats to chew on cotton-tipped wooden swabs (Fisherbrand) for 10 s. Faecal samples were collected by rectal swab, using a 3-mm diameter rayontipped aluminium swab (Technical Service Consultants Ltd) dipped in sterile Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline DPBS (Gibco). Swabs were stored in uniquely numbered cryovials containing 1 ml RNAlater (Ambion) or VTM (10% foetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin, fungizone antimycotic).

Separate models were constructed for each combination of sample type (faecal and saliva), filtering condition (all viruses and vertebrate-infecting) and taxonomic level (family and genus). The percentage of the total raw reads sampled was standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of percentages, and pool ID was included as a random effect in the model.For each data set, linear and second-degree polynomial models were tested and compared using a likelihood ratio test and the change in Akaike information criterion (\u0394AIC), with a better fitting polynomial model indicating a plateau in the number of viral taxa detected at attained read depths. 3 | RESULTS 3.1 | Metagenomic sequencing reveals diverse viral nucleic acid in FBS (Pilot study 1) A total of 21,501,182 raw reads were generated from the two batches of FBS.

Similar patterns were observed for all viruses, not just those infecting vertebrates, and results were consistent when analyses were repeated at the level of viral genera (data not shown).

As rRNA depletion significantly decreased the quantity of nucleic acid, increased PCR cycles were necessary to generate sufficient material for sequencing for enriched samples; however, this difference is not expected to influence the proportion or composition of viral reads.Although PCR errors can be problematic in sequencing studies, we do not expect them to impact our results because viruses are assigned at the level of family or genus, rather than species or subspecies, where such errors could have a greater influence on taxonomic assignment. Final libraries were quantified, pooled, and A harsher DNase treatment was also tested for its effect on the number of viral reads and viral taxa detected.

This could be explained by the presence of viral RNA transcripts, DNA viruses that replicate through an RNA intermediate (e.g., Hepadnaviridae), the ability of some DNA virus families to integrate into the genome of their host (e.g., Herpesviridae) or DNA being carried through the DNase treatment into library prep due to the light treatment or less than perfect efficiency of the reaction.Although more intensive enrichment such as filtration or centrifugation could potentially have increased the number of viral reads, such methods are known to be biased against certain taxa(Concei\u00e7\u00e3o-Neto et al., 2015;Kleiner et al., 2015;Wood-Charlson, Weynberg, Suttle, Roux, & Oppen, 2015). In addition, it would be impossible to include a filtration step since swabs were immediately treated with lysis buffer in the extraction, leading to lysis of the viral particles which would normally be selected for using filtration. In the light of the above results, and despite the relatively small number of samples, we recommend rRNA depletion and light DNase treatment as an effective combination for viral enrichment.",
