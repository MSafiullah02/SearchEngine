To maintain international guidelines and precautions for infection control, various protective measures have been taken to control the contamination of the dental clinics and to protect the patient and the dental personal. The significant part of infection control is the clinician's mouth mask which acts as a strike to microorganisms from the touch of possibly contaminated hands to the contaminated aerosols due to routine ultrasonic scaling and high-speed handpieces.[67]",

Their used surgical masks maximum of 30 min duration, which were 240 in total, were collected in sterile zip lock pouches to culture and analysis of the bacterial and fungal counts on the inside and outside surface of the mouth masks. Inside and outside surface of the mouth masks were separated by sterile technique and put in a sterile container consisting of trypticase soy broth for 25 min. A spread plate method was used for determining total bacterial and fungal counts. General bacteria of the specimen are cultivated in a plate count agar (PCA) and general fungi of the specimen are cultivated in a Sabouraud 4% dextrose agar (SDA). The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h to get the bacterial counts, and incubated at room temperature for 7 days for fungal counts. The observation was done daily for 10 days. With the method given by Larone 1995, preliminarily identification of microorganism's species present was done by Gram's stain and microscopic morphology (lactophenol cotton blue) of the isolated bacteria and fungi was performed.[11] After incubation, the bacterial and fungal colonies were counted and calculated to express as colony-forming unit/m3 (cfu/m3) by a formula as follows:",

The disposable surgical mouth masks were at first developed to strain aerosols containing microorganisms discharged from the mouth and nose, and probably to shield the human respiratory system from fine airborne particles that are known to be linked with various respiratory disorders.[2] Normally surgical mouth mask is developed to prevent microorganisms from the nose and oral cavity of the dental operator from spreading to others. However, surgical mouth mask is not well designed to filter particles of some infectious agents, especially M. tuberculosis.[9] In the present study, bacteria and fungi were significantly more in number on the outer surface of contaminated used surgical mask which was found similar to study done by Luksamijarulkul et al. with the presence of bacteria and fungi on outer surface of mask 166 \u00b1 199 cfu/ml/piece and 34 \u00b1 18 cfu/ml/piece, P < 0.001 respectively.[2] In 1998 Kretzer and Larson stated that some used mask behaviors probably increased the microbial contamination on the masks.[20] Therefore, it is suggested that surgical masks could filter most of microorganism from the environment of dental clinics. Luksamijarulkul et al. in their study found that the majority of isolates are Staphylococcus aureus (41%) and Pseudomonas species(38%) similar to the present study, and the most isolatedfungi were Aspergillus species(44%) and Penicillum species(25%) from the isolated incubated colonies, while in our study, only Aspergillus spp. was present as fungal colony.[2]",
