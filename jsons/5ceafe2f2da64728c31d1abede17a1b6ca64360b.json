            "text": "Since at least the late 1990s, a wide range of contemporary philosophers, aestheticians, and other theorists of the arts have embraced the once heretical practice of ethical criticism. 1 It is not uncommon to find one's colleagues unabashedly discussing the ethical content of literary works, arguing for the edifying effects of literature in general, and attempting to find room for ethical content and consequences under the rubric of the aesthetic. Not everyone thinks this turn toward the ethical a good thing. Academic journals and conference programs are alive with disputes over whether reading literature really can make us better citizens or kinder people, and if so, how; whether the expression of morally objectionable views should be regarded as marring the artistic value of a work of art; to what extent, if any, artists should be held responsible for the effects of their art and so on. The very existence of these debates attests to the status of ethical criticism as a sanctioned topic in contemporary aesthetics.",

It concerns the enterprise of ethical criticism as such. My question is this: What are we doing when we assign moral values to a work of art? In somewhat different terms, what does moral judgment come to when the object of judgment is a work of art? In a broad sense, what do these judgments mean?",

Literary forms such as the novel and short story provide an obvious starting place for inquiring into what we are doing when we bring moral categories to bear on works of art more generally. 2 \"Narrative\" is, after all, a fancy word for story and I take it as a datum that questions about good and bad, right and wrong, harm and benefit tend to arise naturally in the context of storytelling. Some of what I say may apply to other narrative forms: fictional film, drama, or narrative painting. The urge to make moral judgments arises in our response to these kinds of narrative as well. However, the feature of visual representation in narrative painting and film complicates these cases in ways that require a separate analysis. Similarly, for the element of live performance in the case of staged drama. Hence my focal point here remains exclusively works of narrative literature, works that we engage through reading.",

These include empirical questions about the impact of reading and the role of the moral imagination on human behavior and values; normative questions about artistic responsibility of the kind noted above; 3 and the broader relationship of aesthetic and ethical values in literature. 4 Unlike these questions, the issue of how to understand the content of the moral judgments we make of novels and short stories or what we are doing when we make such judgments remains, for the most part, unasked. Perhaps this is so because defenders and critics of ethical criticism alike tend to assume that moral judgment functions in literary contexts much in the same way it does in ordinary life. If deeming a novel immoral (or moral) is nothing special, it requires no special analysis. It is part of my contention, however, that what we are doing in making these judgments is special and requires a separate account.",

To anticipate, my leading idea is that moral judgments about narrative literature can best be understood in the context of a particular conception of the nature of narrative fiction.

Appearances deceive. On this view, the real object of evaluation when we engage with literary works is something else, typically either the work's characters and their motivations and actions (Kurtz, Dorian Gray), or the implied author's (implied) attitude toward the characters or the effects of the novel on real-world beliefs and actions. Another possibility is that the real object of moral appraisal is the actual historical author.

The second is an instance of ethical criticism cited by Wayne Booth in his discussion of Huckleberry Finn. The third example I take from Colin McGinn's discussion of Lolita in his Ethics, Evil, and Fiction. I want to bracket the question of the truth or falsity of these judgments and look instead at their structure. What are these judgments about? In the first example, we find Socrates laying out rules and precepts to which the poets of the just city are meant to conform. The object of his disapprobation appears to be a certain group of poets. Those who write works misrepresenting the gods deserve condemnation, even banishment. In the second case, talk of the \"bad education\" likely to result from an assigned reading of Huckleberry Finn leads us to see the judgment involved as directed at the book's consequences. Here Twain's novel is treated as a causal agent much as one might regard HIV or the SARS virus as a causal agent. 10 It is these effects on the undergraduate reader that Booth's colleague finds unsupportable. In the final example, we see McGinn making judgments that can easily be read as directed at Nabokov, the real-life author, and his fictional creation, the character Humbert Humbert. It is the historical Nabokov who has \"bamboozled our habitual reactions to good and evil,\" and it is the character Humbert Humbert who brings this \"bamboozlement\" to life. 11 One can see how in each of these instances, the judgment involved can be read as being (or being reducible to), a judgment about something other than the literary work itself.",

His criticism is aimed not merely at the moral character of the poets, but at the impiety of the poetry they produce. In the second case, Booth's outraged colleague directs his remarks not merely at the effects of reading Huckleberry Finn, but at \"that book,\" the literary work \"so cleverly written\" by Mark Twain. It is this book that is held to be \"bad.\" In the last example, a careful reading of McGinn's remarks reveals that his discussion of author and character is meant to support a conclusion directed fundamentally at the novel, Lolita. It is the novel's moral and aesthetic trespass that occupies McGinn here. 12 To suggest that these judgments are about nothing more than authors, characters, and effects and not the literary works themselves is to miss the plain meaning of the sentences that express them.",

Let me try to illustrate what I have in mind and why I think it important by considering a fourth example, the German writer Bernard Schlink's highly acclaimed, but problematic novel The Reader. 13 Apart from any judgment about its author (of whom I know very little) or its good and bad effects on its German or non-German readers, the novel is deeply offensive. Central to the story is Hannah, a rather unlikable woman who seduces, then deceives and abandons the fifteen-year-old narrator of the story. Hannah reappears years later, on trial for war crimes (e.g., serving as a guard at a German concentration camp and refusing to intervene when a church full of women prisoners under her care is set on fire). Hannah's crimes are horrible. But literature is full of villains. Hannah may be somewhat worse than some, but surely not alone among fictional characters.",

The personal shame of her illiteracy is allowed to overshadow larger moral and political issues in ways that seem to me morally problematic. The point here is not that the novel's characters behave badly, nor that its narrator evidences considerable complacency about human evil. Clearly the novelist might have written such a story precisely to expose the immorality of behavior like Hannah's or the self-absorption of her heedless lover. This is not, I think, the case with Schlink's novel. As I read it, the novel allows the individual tragedy of illiteracy to distort the moral terrain it surveys.",

We can approach the question about what we are doing when we direct our moral attention to the literary work itself, by asking what it is to read a novel. This is a complicated question, one I cannot address fully here. But even a limited discussion of the nature of the activity of reading will shed light on the activity of making judgments about novels themselves. When we read a narrative, we read it in a particular way. We do not just take in the words and individual incidents. We typically find ourselves asking questions about what is going on; about why the characters and their motives are presented as they are; about the novel's point of view. Thus, for example, we may ask what attitude Lolita takes toward Humbert Humbert's pedophilia; what we as readers are to make of his predilection; and about the meaning or point of the narrative.

            "text": "The notion of purposiveness brings with it the idea of an agent. We read the novel as if it has been designed with our interests (cognitive, moral, political) in mind. Kant's notion of purposiveness without purpose provides a model for the conception of reading I am developing. Kant speaks of our seeing order and arrangement in nature (in a flower or bird plumage). The sort of case he has in mind is one in which we are not able to \"locate the causes of this form in a will,\" since we have no epistemological access to the existence of a deity. We \"are able to render the explanation of its possibility intelligible to ourselves only by deriving it from a will.\" 14 One also finds the idea of purposiveness in Hume. In The Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, Cleanthes elaborates on this idea in advancing a version of the argument from design. \"Consider, anatomize the eye,\" he directs. \"Survey its structure and contrivance: and tell me, from your own feeling, if the idea of a contriver does not immediately flow in upon you with a force like that of sensation.\" 15 Cleanthes's claim here is that, as Jerry Sobel points out, \"the intelligibility of the world is expressible only in terms of design, that is, in intentional terms.\" 16 The same is true of written narratives. We read them in intentional terms. Indeed, their intelligibility rests on a notion of intentionality. As Stanley Cavell maintains, the concept of intentionality is \"inescapable\" in speaking of art, as inescapable as in our talk of \"what human beings say and do.\" Absent the idea of intention, \"we would not understand what they [works of art or human beings] are.\" 17 The idea of a creator, the fact of having been created, \"flows in upon us\" because it is, so to speak, built into the experience of looking at and understanding works of narrative. 18 The idea is that of a literary creator or intelligence presupposed by the activity of reading itself. We read a narrative text as if it were written by an author who has produced the text in such a way as to prompt certain questions and provide the resources to begin to answer them. 19 It will be useful to have a term for the idea of what we do when we find the idea of a creator \"flowing in upon us.\" Let us say that we \"posit an author.\" The \"posited author\" is the analogue of Hume's imagined contriver. The act of positing an author, as I understand it, is best understood as a kind of logical act. It is not separate and distinct from the act of making these presuppositions or reading under the idea of literary purposiveness. It is not a datable psychological event. The point is that simply in reading a narrative text, we posit an author. Doing so is intrinsic to the structure of reading itself. 20 The concept of the posited author is distinct from a number of similar concepts standardly employed in the critical literature. First, the concept of the posited author is distinct from the concept of the historical author. The historical author of the novel, The Grass is Singing, is the real-life person, Doris Lessing; what I am calling the posited author is, in contrast, an interpretive construct, \"a fiction.\" Its function is to allow us to read the text in a certain way, that is, under the concept of literary purposiveness. Access to the particular features of the given posited author is secured through the imagination. The fact that we are not thinking about the historical author when we posit an author is marked by the fact that claims about the posited author are cast as claims about the novel. The point can be put the other way: moral judgments about the literary work itself are moral judgments about the posited author. The idea of the posited author is not an alternative to the idea of the work itself, but an explication of what this idea is.",

The notion of the implied author brings with it aspects of what real-life authors do that are simply absent from the notion of the posited author. The notion of the posited author is more abstract. For Booth, the implied author is something optional, something that may or may not be there, something that may or may not be found. For me, the notion of the posited author is a presupposition of reading a narrative. To read a narrative is to posit an author. For Booth, the implied author is constructed by the historical author. For me, the posited author is a construct of the reader. Thus, although I think that Booth probably does have the notion of the posited author, the notion is not captured by his conception of the implied author.",

            "text": "With this in mind, let us reexamine the mindset from which the idea of making judgments about the novel itself appears outlandish. When we raised skeptical doubts about the meaningfulness of moral judgments about texts themselves, we were thinking of the novel as a book, something constituted by ink and paper and glue. As readers, however, the primary object of our attention is not the pages-the ink on paper-but the story. To make sense of such judgments we must consider the narrative from the standpoint of the reader. Seen from that standpoint, the posited author becomes intelligible. We read under the concept of literary purposiveness. Positing an author is a presupposition of reading itself. Now that we have a basic grip on the idea of the posited author, we are in a position to look at the conception of the novel that goes with it. The conception I have in mind is familiar and traditional. Lionel Trilling draws on it when he observes that the novel \"is an especially useful agent of the moral imagination.\" 24 This characterization of the novel sees the novel as a kind of moral tool. It accentuates the capacity of the novel to reveal the wide range and complexity of human types and their development over time, something less easily achieved with less capacious literary forms like poetry or short stories. Iris Murdoch notably develops this idea, describing the \"calm merciful vision\" of the novelist, a vision that allows the reader imaginative access to \"how different people are and why they are different.\" 25 The result, Murdoch observes, is \"the breath of tolerance and generosity and intelligent kindness\" that great novelists achieve.",

Despite their disagreement, both miss something crucial about literature, and about ethical criticism itself. Posner fails to understand the centrality of the ethical to literature, particularly in the case of the novel, a form inescapably concerned with imagining lives better or worse than our own (and the focus of his debate with Nussbaum). For Posner, the ethical dimension of literature is optional: something we can attend to or not. Like most aestheticists, Posner recommends the latter. Ethical criticism, on his view, merely directs our attention away from what makes literature literature. It is a distraction. Why? Because it reduces literature to \"moral pep pills\" 32 or a call to action. Now Posner is surely right that moral judgments that take as their object the work's realworld author or its effects may, and in some cases will, turn our attention away from the stylistic and structural matters central to the value of literature. Then again, they may not. Moral concern with the fact that Nabokov manages to make the pedophile, Humbert Humbert, sympathetic need not exclude attention to Lolita's literary strategies; to the contrary. More importantly, however, Posner fails to recognize that some kinds of moral judgments, as I have argued, take the literary work itself as their object. (More on the consequences of this oversight in a moment.) Nussbaum makes the same mistake. She fails to recognize the centrality of the moral standing of the narrative itself, locating the moral dimension of literature too narrowly in its effects. In this, she leaves herself wide open to Posner's objection that, in her hands, literature is diminished, reduced to a causal lever in the world, a call to action for a given political agenda. 33 Despite nuanced attention to language and style, Nussbaum's literary interpretations in Poetic Justice, for example, leave little doubt that she employs literature-and literary criticismprimarily in instrumental terms. Native Son and the other novels she discusses are intended as a means to improve the moral sympathies of the judiciary. 34 This effort to restore literature to its ancient and honorable position in public life, commendable though it is, leads too readily to the mistaken view that ethical criticism involves nothing but judgments about the moral effects of the work (and indirectly about the historical authors responsible for those effects). What I hope to have established here is that such a view of ethical criticism is incomplete and misguided.",

Opponents of ethical criticism rightly insist that without considerable sensitivity to literature's aesthetic features, we lose much of the pleasure and instruction literature at its best provides. And if I am right, we do ethical criticism by developing just this aesthetic sensitivity.

This process is not simple.

This proclivity to erode the distinction between the work and something else may be even stronger in the case of works and their presumed effects, where moral reservations about a given outcome get freely transferred to the work presumed to bring it about. In other instances, we are not confused. We mean to use talk of the \"work\" as a kind of shorthand.
