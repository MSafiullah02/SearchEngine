The prevalence and economic importance of this virus remain poorly understood, and no specific serological assay has been developed for the diagnosis of MiCV infection. Results: In this study, a recombinant capsid protein antigen expressed in Escherichia coli was utilized to establish an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA). Results revealed that the assay had no cross-reactivity with other related pathogens, and the respective sensitivity and specificity of the proposed iELISA were 92.31% and 91.67% compared with those obtained of Western blot on 138 serum samples from minks. The correlation coefficient between iELISA and Western blot was 0.838 (p > 0.05). iELISA was applied to detect MiCV antibodies in 683 clinical serum samples from different farms from the major mink industry province in China, and 21 of 24 farms with 163 of 683 (23.87%) individuals were tested positive for MiCV antibodies. The positive rates of each of the 21 flocks ranged from 2.33% to 73.68%. Conclusions: These results indicated that iELISA was a sensitive and specific method suitable for the large-scale detection of MiCV infections in mink. This study provided an effective method for the serological diagnosis and positive rate investigation of MiCV infection.",

MiCV is a member of Circovirus belonging to the Circoviridae family. MiCVs are single-stranded circular DNA viruses with a genome of 1753 nucleotides, which contain two major open reading frames (ORF). One is ORF1, which encodes a replicase-associated protein (rep) required for viral replication. The other is ORF2, which encodes proteins that form the viral capsid (cap) and participate in host immune responses. Circoviruses have been identified in numerous species associated with various clinical disorders [2, 3] , including asymptomatic infections and lethal diseases [4, 5] . Circovirus infections are also related to lymphoid depletion and immunosuppression, which likely increase the severity of secondary infection [6] .",

Cap is the only structural protein of circovirus and is the major immunogenic protein produced in circovirus-infected animals. It had a large number of arginine residues concentrated at the Nterminus, which can inhibits the mRNA translation. As such, this protein is a major viral target, it plays a critical role in virus antigenic and useful tool for epidemiological surveys. Using recombinant capsid protein to develop ELISA method for the detection of circovirus like PCV2 and DuCV have been confirmed [9, [14] [15] [16] [17] . Wang et al. reports that PCV2 can infect mink [18] . The amino acid sequences of Cap, especially in the first 40 amino acid residues of the N-terminal regions, in PCV2 are highly homologous to those of MiCV. To avoid the possible cross-reaction of the two viruses in future detections, we deleted the first 40 amino acid residues of the N-terminal regions, which unlikely affect protein antigenicity [9, 19] .",
