            "text": "The ethnographic fieldwork for my doctoral degree in anthropology was conducted in Tokachi, Hokkaido. Hokkaido is Japan's northernmost island and by far the nation's largest prefecture. For a year I worked on an industrial dairy farm neighbouring a town with an ever-declining population of around 5000; a number down from over 16,000 in the early 1960s.1\nThis research primarily focuses on a single agricultural community, in large part a single farm, and the people who work and live there. The analysis within this doctoral project essentially follows three tracks; how local people confront their ageing, urbanizing, and so decreasing permanent population, why many family farms fail while several large industrial farms emerge, and why concomitantly, a large number of young Japanese from metropolitan centres arrive in this Tokachi community to temporarily experience rural life, with a small minority choosing to stay indefinitely (Hansen, 2010a). This article extends this research trajectory focussing on the move to rotary dairy parlour milking technology and the cow/human relationships that this shift creates as viewed through the analytical lenses of affect theory and posthuman Human Animal Studies (HAS).",

In so doing, it also introduces the posthuman and affective processes that are involved in the increasing transformation towards \u2018progressive\u2019 industrialisation. First, the article historically situates the development of human, cow, and technology on the Hokkaido \u2018frontier\u2019. It then describes dairy farmers' memories and imaginaries of a mixed farm past and lamentations about the industrial present. An ethnographic description of the rotary parlour as an animal-human-machine in motion is then offered. Dairy cows are then discussed objectively from a macro perspective and subjectively from a micro perspective. The final section of the paper is a discussion of the current state and promise of Hokkaido's animal-human-machine. Focussing on Hokkaido is important in the context of Japan because, as noted below, the island is an anomaly. However, in terms of the development of modern industrial dairy farming, it is a space that is readily comparable to Europe and North America.",

Originally called ezo ga shima (Barbarian Island), it was renamed Hokkaido (North Sea Route) and officially declared part of Japan in 1869. The island, and notably the Tokachi region (south central Hokkaido), was \u2018developed\u2019 largely through tactics of Euro-American colonisation eagerly sought and bought by the Meiji government (1868\u20131912). Thus, Hokkaido is an area that, from topography, to climate, to politics, to population, remains a particularly hard-to-place space in terms of industry, imagery, or imagination in the context of Japan. It is widely considered to be Japan's \u2018frontier\u2019; a peripheral kitanokuni (north country) that is clearly set apart from mainland Japan as represented by Fig. 1\n.",

Indeed, most English language research on Japan is firmly fixed on aesthetics, urban concerns, or comparative public policy and not on developing industries or the impact of new technologies in rural areas. Recently, some research has focused on a cycle of depopulation, decline and attempts at rejuvenation (Hansen, 2010a; Kitano, 2009; Matanle and Rausch, 2011; Mock, 2006; Woods, 2012). But, rural Japan, though often romantically imagined as the essence of \u201crice culture\u201d or the quintessence of seasonal aesthetics, is largely viewed as unimportant for investigations of contemporary Japan. Thus, the industrialization of Tokachi area dairy farming is a \u2018novel\u2019 research topic amongst a sea of \u2018epic\u2019 or essentialist discourses; for example investigations into the oft cited \u201cuniqueness\u201d of Japanese culture in terms of martial arts, tea ceremony, animated film, etcetera.3\n",

The impact of the recent shift away from an, albeit likely romantically idealized, version of the self-sufficient family farm is particularly notably considering the move to high-technology, high-output and high-overhead milking practices and bovine husbandry methods over the last generation. Again, under scrutiny in what follows is the influence of rotary dairy parlour technology on bovine and human bonds and how the linkages shared between human and non-human are remarkably similar in the face of increasing industrialisation. Towards this end, affect is an area of theory where pointed phenomenological comparisons can be drawn.",

            "text": "Theories of affect are utilised by a diverse range of humanities and social science scholars. Deleuze and Guattari (1987, 258\u2013262), via Baruch Spinoza, is generally viewed as the contemporary key reference for understanding affects as a tangible force at the heart of what scholars such as Patricia Clough (2010, 206\u2013225) has coined \u201cthe affective turn\u201d in social theory; the notion that non-human elements, material environments or non-human actants can influence events, or even \u201cstructures of feeling\u201d to lift, as Gregg and Seigworth do in the introduction to their co-edited volume of affect, from Raymond Williams (2010, 7\u20139). More to the point at hand, Brian Massumi has turned to affect as an analytic space that allows agency to be discussed in terms of non-linguistic, even precognitive, communications and perceptions; embodied memory for example (2003). For scholars inclined towards more teleological schemata of cause and effect \u2013 explanations of the if a then b variety \u2013 discussions of affect can be frustrating. Affect is a motivating factor impossible to deny in earnest, yet particularly slippery to secure. Kathleen Stewart aptly describes this dilemma in defining Ordinary Affects as;\u2026abstract and concrete\u2026more directly compelling than ideologies, as well as more fractious, multiplicitous, and unpredictable than symbolic meanings. They are not the kind of analytic object that can be laid out on a single, static plane of analysis, and they don't lend themselves to a perfect, three-tiered parallelism between analytic subject, concept, and world. They are\u2026a tangle of potential connections.\n(Stewart, 2007: 3\u20134)\n",

These names have not been arbitrarily chosen however. They are similar to the original names with some creative license taken. This is because such names underscore a specific relationship to space, industry, and history. In northern Japan, place names are heavily influenced by natural topographic markers or adapted from the Ainu language (Kagami, 2009). A similar situation has been detailed in Michael Shapiro's seminal text Violent Cartographies: Mapping Cultures of War in terms of North America (1997). In sum, indigenous place names are adopted and then adapted to the language of the coloniser; an act of both conquering and reifying the conquest of local culture and the space of native others. Moreover, the notion of colonized space as \u2018open frontier\u2019, that is to say under or un-inhabited before colonization, is also reinforced by utilizing place names linked natural phenomena symbolising that such locations transcend their associations with indigenous inhabitants; hence regardless of native names, spaces become, Big Rock, White Beach, etcetera.

In this case, language is deployed in the reverse of the above example. Katakana functions like a linguistic sponge in that it absorbs any non-Japanese word reworking it into Japanese; and, as the hackneyed joke goes, equally incomprehensible to Japanese and foreigners alike. Nevertheless, the key point is that the majority of dairy farms in northern Tokachi, the earliest ones being homesteaded around 1905, have a katakana name; for example Happy Farm (happi-f\u0101-mu) or Big Hill Farm (bigu hiru f\u0101-mu). In terms of marking space, understanding this utilisation of language and script is essential; it makes clear that the land is colonised and the dairy industry, alongside any nostalgic imagery or local idealized imaginary, is heavily influenced by livelihoods that were, until the 20th Century, external to Hokkaido. Usually one can trace these contemporary borrowings, in name and practice, to the pioneering history of the US, or less often to the rural idyllic imagination of a bygone Northern Europe (Fujita, 1994; Irish, 2009). Simply put, dairy farming is, by-and-large a modern occupation in Japan, completely so in Hokkaido. It is a livelihood greatly influenced, indeed exported, by \u2018The West\u2019 and carried out on an annexed island.",

            "text": "There are three main differences. First, in Tokachi, as in most of Hokkaido, villages are not the centre of agricultural life (Soda, 2006). Like North America, Hokkaido has individual and individuated farms (Irish, 2009; the classic geographic overview of Japan is Trewartha, 1965). This is based on the relatively large land base and homesteading history starting in the early 1900s and peaking due to repatriation in the five years following the Second World War. There is very little common land and one can easily bypass local village life if one so chooses. This underscores a second difference. In most of rural Japan, certainly on the mainland of Honshu, rail systems generally link villages and rural areas to urban centres. However, Gensan has no rail system. Due to its declining population, the distance between villages, the costs and challenges of harsh winters, and the linked inability to turn a profit, Gensan's railway was shut down in 1989. The nearest city and rail link is in Tokachi's capital city of Obihiro about 35 km to the south. Finally Tokachi, and notably the area around Gensan, has a unique advantage over many farming regions in Japan, one that has led it to become a leader in the rather resource intensive dairy farming/industry, an expanse of relatively cheap, obstacle free, yet seasonal and only moderately productive, farmland. Soy beans, potatoes, and feed corn are common crops in this volcanic rocky soil, but the low cost of land and the moderate profitability of these counter industries means that there is room for dairy and beef farms to expand; at least in terms of erecting Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO) style \u201cfarms\u201d (See Kirby, 2010 for a detailed discussion of CAFO types and practices). Rapid industrialisation, the move from the family farm to the family owned agricultural monoculture factory, has been the story of Japanese dairy farming for the last twenty years; and in Tokachi this has meant a lot more cows and a lot fewer people.",

Cows provided Tokachi settlers with milk and eventually meat, but also body heat, as housed cattle kept stores from freezing in the bitter winter, and their dung was essential crop fertilizer. It is clear that such relations benefited human more than bovine, then again, few human relationships are truly egalitarian. But more to the point, by virtue of funeral monuments (chikukonhi) erected on the behalf of cows and inscriptions of mourning and gratitude, one can safely assume empathic and affective bonds were forged over lives shared in an unforgiving landscape. What follows underscores that the reality of dairy farming today, outside of farms designed for tourist consumption such as naitai bokujyou, where one can eat locally made ice cream overlooking cows grazing on the open pasture of the daisetsuzan foothills, differs considerably.5\n",

The operation had shifted from being a single family owned farm with around 150 cattle in 1999 to a four family owned joint corporation with over 2400 head and still growing monthly as of 2012. Expansion of this magnitude is only possible through changes in technology; from animal husbandry practices to mass feed importation to manure treatment. All elements of this industrialization equation are important and each has its own list of problems, but in what follows discussion is limited to the specifics of the move from older milking technologies, such as single stall or herringbone systems, to the rotary parlour system.",

For the dairy owners and their families the shift to a rotary parlour system has been a drastic change in lifestyle and livelihood. In economic terms it represents a high stakes gamble.

The mistake made in such accusations has been discussed in detail by Henri Lefebvre (2004: 51\u201356).\u2026The impact of technological conquests does not make the everyday anymore alive; it nourishes ideology\u2026[the ideology of modernity and capitalism]. The personalisation of capital, a theoretical error, can lead to practical (political) errors\u2026[as this ideology]\u2026is not directly a question of the people. It is not their fault because there is no fault, there is something that functions implacably and produces its effects.\n(2004: 53\u201354 emphasis Lefebvre's)\n",

In sum, dairy owners have little effective say over the price of their milk. Their choices in regard to production and sale invariably come from above and are presented in binary terms; they can sell their quota at the price set by the government and industry or they cannot legally sell milk.

As aforementioned, there are few viable ways to farmland in Tokachi and there is a scarcity of ways to earn a living in the area but to farm. The choice to not industrialise, and some farmers have consciously made this choice, is to retire from farming, seek work off the farm (often low-skilled seasonal construction jobs), or for the more intrepid, leave the area altogether. But those who do stay in the industry, and clearly an \u2018industry\u2019 it has steadily become, feel overwhelming pressure to expand motivated by a fusion of needs and desires; economic survival, lack of feasible alternative opportunities, a pride of place, and a sense of local/self-identity, romanticised or not, as Tokachi dairymen.6\nFew are motivated by unbridled neo-liberal acquisitiveness; including the owner of Great Hopes Farm, the largest in the area.",

            "text": "This is apparent when talking with dairy farmers. Most local owners I interviewed waxed nostalgic about their mixed farming past. They recalled a more symbiotic lifestyle shared with their family members and cows twenty or thirty years before my research. This was a time when money was made through mixed farming; varied crops and a dozen, to maybe thirty, dairy cows hand or line milked twice-a-day by family members for local market sales. However, the current agricultural production and market system in Japan is wedded to the state's obsession with programs and policies that are frequently contradictory. For example, the system strives for national food self-sufficiency on the one hand, but is beset with ill-planned subsidies that support or protect small inefficient farms from competition, both national and international, while forwarding policies that force mid-sized farms to expand with the said goal of increasing their competitiveness; in effect playing farmers off of farmers. This is confounded by co-operative associations such as JA that ostensibly act on behalf of dairy producers, but in fact work foremost to expand their own political reach within the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and increase their profits through providing loans to farmers or securing low milk prices for product companies; these are actions that oscillate betwixt inanity and greed that have forced the progressive industrialisation of mid-sized family diary farms (Hansen, 2010a). Put bluntly, Aurelia Mulgan, perhaps the foremost scholar of Japanese agricultural policy in English, sums up the Japanese agricultural policy as simply schizophrenic (Mulgan, 2006)! Thus, in most cases it clearly is not individual avariciousness or disinterest in bovine or human well-being that drives farmers. Instead they are driven by hope that things will improve; and it is perhaps their greatest hope being to hold out for another year.",

In Tokachi to industrialise in the present tense is to move to the large scale rotary parlour system. This is an important point in itself as other modes of industrialisation are not considered practicable. This contrasts, for example, with the increasing popularity of robotic dairy milking equipment elsewhere in the world's dairy industry (Holloway, 2007; this issue of the Journal of Rural Studies). Robotic milking technology is unlikely to set firm roots around Gensan anytime soon and this position is entrenched in a very particular human\u2013cow-technology regional history on the one hand, and the pragmatics of space and scale on the other.",

This cow to robot disconnect is somewhat ironic in a nation that is on the cutting edge of the positive potential of the interface between humans and robotics (Katsuno, 2011).

Moreover, many such farms are owned by elderly farmers and are likely to go out of business when they retire or expire.

They adjust the pneumatic suction head that automatically rises from the base of the machine to udder level and attach the four suction hoses to each teat while checking for any leg bands that indicate sickness or dysfunctional udders. After attaching four hoses they push a button that, from a sensor attached to each animal's collar, sends the sort number, group number, and a record of each animal's daily milk output to a central computer. During this stage of the milking process human and animal contact averages less than eighteen seconds. The Holsteins cannot see the workers and workers only see bovine legs, udders, suction equipment, and a digital readout of cattle numbers.

This worker generally acts as a bovine observer and recorder as the cows enter the parlour with the aid of a twenty meter long automated gate. The gate electronically senses the lack of cattle body weight impeding its forward progress and pushes ahead until it contacts an animal. Dairy cows in such cramped conditions move to where there is more space, specifically, the space ahead where members of the herd have already entered the parlour access chute. However, more reluctant cows, often young ones fearful of the noise and bright lights of the parlour are manually, often violently prodded along so as to keep pace with the machine and allow as few \u2018free stalls\u2019 as possible.",

At this point an automated gate separates cattle whose numbers are entered earlier into the central computer by the office staff, such as cattle known to be ill or animals moving to another group due to the stage of pregnancy.

To be clear, this is not to signify a move towards a Critical Animal Studies (CAS) perspective, though I am not against such a move by others, but to signal a Human Animal Studies (HAS) trajectory. Simply, setting ideological motivations to critique an anthropocentric perspective aside (Cf.\nNussbaum, 2006; Singer, 1975), from a HAS perspective cows clearly retain agency. Undeniably they are thinking and feeling beings who, though dominated for centuries, manage to actively negotiate and influence the human and mechanical world; effecting and affecting as they go. For example, the reasons why robotic milking technology is not accepted in Tokachi is due to the reaction of bovine bodies and the affective reactions that follow this posthuman assemblage of udder, suction, infection, detection, and decision. To grapple with this tangle of interactions a HAS perspective is essential.",

Alterations to bovine bodies, beyond generations of selective breeding, are determined by industrialization. So as not to be caught up in the parlour equipment or injure themselves at play in the close quarters or on the concrete floors required by this mode of production, horns are cut off, tails are docked, and occasionally hind legs are bound to prevent splaying. Thus, adult \u2018play\u2019 and mimicry as noted above, along with the animal's instinctive ability to \u2018swish\u2019 flies away or express emotive states with their tail is restricted or abolished to make the animal more \u2018machine\u2019 friendly. Upon birth calves are separated and weaned in pens where they not only loose contact with their mother but also are unable to play with their cohorts. The reason is twofold, calves consume their mother's milk (the end goal of the parlour) and calves cannot enter the spatially efficient system with their dams. At four or five months of age calves do begin to associate with other calves but not with adults. This reduces their ability to mimic appropriate behaviours or easily understand their roles within the hierarchy of a herd. This leads to considerable violence between cows (individuals) when they become cattle (individuated). This violence follows them into their adult life as the parlour system requires, for the sake of efficiency, that cattle groups (in this case determined by milk output and stage of impregnation) be shifted almost daily. However, \u201c[m]inor changes [in herd composition] result in an approximate doubling of aggression activity for about 24 h, longer if dominant cattle are introduced to a stable group when cattle may continue fighting for 30\u201345 days as they create a new social order.\u201d (Phillips, 2002: 118). Again, 603 was impressive, always last no matter who and no matter what confronted this bewildering desire.

It is a system wherein each \u201cinmate\u201d is codified and their individual progress mapped and stored in a central repository. It is a system where relations between kept and keeper are ideally dehumanised \u2013 that is to say lacking emotion or affect \u2013 distant, cold, clinical and rooted in the need make distanced decisions. In the case of rotary production these are inherently linked to bovine bodily production: Is another attempt at artificial insemination worth the money? Does the injury warrant attention? Is it time to be sold as meat? Foucault's commentary on \u201csecuring the sex\u201d of Herculine Barbin, an 18th Century intersex person, underscores a similar system wherein the desire to physically control and normatively define the body prematurely destroys the life housed in it (Barbin, 1980). The rotary parlour like the panoptic prison is also clearly a system of control where the keepers police, record, and decide with the inability of the kept to witness or resist this invasion or surveillance. And finally, it is a system wherein there is a dissolution of internal hierarchies. Beyond keeper and kept, both bovine and human social structures are called into question, like cattle, it is important to note that human workers could easily be replaced, and frequently were, without disrupting the system of production.",

In sum, the parlour is clearly an area of \u201cbare life\u201d (z\u00f3\u00e9) as opposed to a \u201cpolitical life\u201d (b\u00edos) found in the stall areas or other parts of the dairy farm (Agamben, 2004: 13\u201316, 33\u201338; Esposito, 2008: 13\u201344). Outside the thrice daily subjugation to the machine, cows are relatively free to socialize with other cows and humans; although the groups in which they are housed are still determined by state of impregnation and milk output. Nevertheless, these are spaces where cow 603, 808, 1263, and other workers two and four legged come together in their own rhythms and where memorable affective and embodied contact is made; barns and stalls. Indeed, the differing rhythms enforced through daily practices and states of the bovine body are at the root of the separation of these spaces (Lefebvre, 2004: 27\u201337). The rotary parlour is the material culture link, the \u201ctechn\u0113, or the agent\u201d (Braun and Whatmore, 2010: x\u2013xi) which reduces the sentient, communicative, and feeling bodies of political life or b\u00edos rooted in mutual bodily and affective exchanges experienced within and across species lines, to bare life or z\u00f3\u00e9. Outside the barn and once in the parlour, cow, human, and machine are expected to work as a seamless and senseless one.",

Yet, in the face of all this, the Japanese agricultural regime persists in promoting CAFO style industrialization in the name of food self-sufficiency/security. Thus, the rotary parlour process has trapped Hokkaido, certainly Tokachi, dairy workers, species aside, in what Maley, influenced by Weber, has called \u201cthe iron cage of technology\u201d (2004). Farmers find themselves in politico-technologically determined catch-22; the need to become more efficient, more rational, and more cost effective to survive, even if it is, literally, killing themselves off through debt and stress alongside the cows and the lifestyle they reminisce about. In more pop-cultural parlance, the industry is captive in a \u201cprogress trap\u201d: bigger, faster, more with little concern for living limitations, embodied or affective, human or non-human (Wright, 2004). But increasing efficiency only makes sense in terms of unlimited potential \u2013 such as rising markets, available workers, or arable land. And as I have noted, the availability of all three are stagnating or in decline in rural Hokkaido.",

The argument here is not critical insofar as it is undeniably factual. Tokachi farmers are aware of the ensnarement they are in. Their submission to the blurring of the animal-human-machine is seen through a regional animal-human history. They became bovine as a symbiotic lifestyle to survive a harsh Tokachi physical environment and they have become bovine again.
