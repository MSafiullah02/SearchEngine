The analysis exploits a natural experiment to disentangle the effects of the virus and the laws aiming to contain it: Denmark and Sweden were similarly exposed to the pandemic but only Denmark imposed significant restrictions on social and economic activities. We estimate that aggregate spending dropped by around 25 percent in Sweden and, as a result of the shutdown, by 4 additional percentage points in Denmark. This implies that most of the economic contraction is caused by the virus itself and occurs regardless of whether governments mandate social distancing or not. The age gradient in the estimates suggest that social distancing reinforces the virus-induced drop in spending for individuals with low health risk but attenuates it for individuals with high health risk by lowering the overall prevalence of the virus in the society. *",

By this logic, more severe restrictions help contain the virus and reduce the ultimate death toll but cause more economic pain as more households cut spending, more businesses go bankrupt and more workers lose their jobs. 1 However, this view does not account for the possibility that the underlying health risks that the restrictions are designed to curtail may inflict significant harm on the economy in their own right: individuals may themselves choose to restrain economic activity based on their personal health risk, even when this is not mandated by law. This points to an indirect mechanism whereby shutting down sectors with high social proximity may improve aggregate economic outcomes: it constrains the choices of low-risk individuals (e.g., the young) who would otherwise contribute most to the spreading of the disease and thus induces high-risk individuals (e.g., the old) to choose a higher level of economic activity.",

The two neigh-boring countries, Denmark and Sweden, were exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic in a very similar way. In both countries, the epidemic started on 26-27 February 2020 and mortality rates increased at a similar pace over the following weeks. 2 The policy response, however, differed significantly in the two countries. Starting on 11 March 2020, Denmark took measures to limit social interaction in order to contain the virus: congregations of more than 10 people were prohibited; schools, universities and other non-essential parts of the public sector were shut down; borders were closed for foreign nationals; and the population was encouraged to stay at home and minimize social contact. The measures had direct implications for many types of economic activity involving high social proximity: restaurants were not allowed to seat customers; the entertainment industry including nightclubs, cinemas and concert venues was shut down;",

Importantly, the comparison captures both the direct effects of the restrictions through the reduced availability of goods and services and the indirect effects of the restrictions through the reduced spreading of the virus. By isolating the differential effect of government policy, our analysis is fundamentally different from recent Our analysis is based on transaction data for about 860,000 individuals in Denmark and Sweden who are active customers at Danske Bank, the second-largest bank in Scandinavia with a customer base that is broadly representative of the general population.

This allows us to construct a comprehensive customer-level measure of spending at the daily frequency, which accommodates substitution across modes of payment. 3 Exploiting a standardized classification of merchants, we break down card spending by expenditure categories and add them up to categories of spending that vary in their degree of social proximity, such as social spending in restaurants, cinemas and concert venues, personal care spending at hairdressers, beauticians and dentists and retail shopping on the high street and in malls. Finally, the dataset allows us to distinguish between different demographic segments based on customer information about age and gender.",

            "text": "Our first result is that the Danish shutdown had a modest effect on aggregate spending. We estimate that Danish customers reduced spending by almost 29% relative to a counterfactual trajectory without the COVID-19 pandemic. This is enormous compared to spending drops in other contexts, e.g., it is four times larger than the typical spending drop around unemployment events (Ganong and Noel, 2019; Andersen et al., 2020b), but only around half the size of the aggregate spending drop in countries more adversely affected by the pandemic, such as France (Bounie et al., 2020) and Spain (Carvalho et al., 2020) . By comparison, we estimate that Swedish customers reduced spending by around 25%. 4 The difference of just under 4 percentage points is precisely estimated and represents our preferred estimate of the causal effect of the Danish shutdown on aggregate spending. This finding suggests that, in the context of an escalating pandemic, shutting down sectors with high social proximity is associated with a relatively small loss of aggregate spending. Even when there are no major restrictions on economic activity, as in Sweden, a pandemic induces a sizeable contraction of spending. The additional drop in spending caused by a shutdown, as in Denmark, is relatively small. While these results confirm the popular notion that the lives saved by a shutdown come at an economic cost, the trade-off is much less stark than suggested by the large drops in economic activity around shutdowns.",

For instance, we document a significant drop in the use of cash suggesting that consumers responded to the health risk inherent to touching coins and bills that frequently change hands. 4 This estimate (24.84%) is based on weighting of the Swedish observations to match the socio-demographic (age, gender, income) composition of the Danish sample. The estimate based on the unweighted observations is 24.72%. group (70+ years). When breaking total spending into subcategories, we observe a clear positive age gradient across the four major spending categories involving high social proximity: retail (i.e., high-street shops and malls), social spending (i.e., food, drink and entertainment away from home), personal care (e.g., hairdressers and dentists) and public transport (i.e., trains and busses).

This seasonality presumably reflects people Googling their symptoms. Thus, excess searches for these terms, relative to the average search behaviour in weeks in previous years, suggests an increase in the incidence of illness. Moreover, the symptoms of COVID-19 -especially a cough and a fever -were heavily publicized in the media and by public health authorities as the outbreak took hold. Therefore, excess searches for these terms in early 2020 may reflect both signs of an outbreak and heightened awareness of COVID-19. As Figure 1 demonstrates, Google searches for these terms began rising in Sweden and Denmark at precisely the same time in mid-February. By contrast, the series for Italy shows that Google searches for these terms were already above normal in January, highlighting how these data capture the differential timing of outbreaks across countries.",

On 18 March, the government announced further restrictions banning congregations of more than 10 individuals, shutting down shopping malls, closing establishments of high physical proximity, such as nightclubs and hairdressers, limiting healthcare practices such as dentists to emergency treatment only, and restricting restaurants, cafes and bars to take-away service only.

Examples of social spending include payments on food and drink away from home, cinemas, museums and galleries, theatres, and sports clubs. Second, we measure spending on personal care services, a type of spending that is characterised by one-on-one physical contact and includes services such as hairdressers and beauticians, and spending on medical services, such as dentists and opticians. Third, we measure spending on public transport as purchases of bus, train, and metro transportation; all venues of potentially high social proximity.

First, while we documented above that the two countries were similarly exposed to the spreading of the virus, one may be concerned that the ensuing global economic crisis affected them differently so as to confound our analysis. For instance, one may imagine that Swedish firms were particularly affected by the contraction of international trade and that differential stock market losses and unemployment risks can explain why Swedish consumers reduced spending so much despite the virtual absence of restrictions on economic activity. However, as shown in the Appendix, the major stock market indexes in Denmark and Sweden followed almost the exact same trajectory through the crisis ( Figure   A2 ) and, if anything, the rise in unemployment claims was slightly sharper in Denmark than in Sweden ( Figure A3 ). 15 Second, one may be concerned that the Danish government offered particularly generous subsidies to firms and workers and that these measures partly offset the negative effect of the social distancing laws in Denmark. In the Appendix, we compare the government programs designed to sustain the economy in Denmark and Sweden and show that they were strikingly similar. Finally, as there is some economic integration between Southern Sweden and Eastern Denmark, part of the drop in Swedish spending could, in principle, reflect 14 These estimates are reported with standard errors in Figure A1 in the Appendix. The estimates are based on weighting of the Swedish observations to match the socio-demographic (age, gender, income) composition of the Danish sample. The unweighted estimate of the spending drop in Sweden is 24.72%. 15 In a recent paper, we document that economic exposure to the COVID-19 crisis in the form of stock market participation and employment in at-risk industries only accounts for a limited part of the aggregate spending drop in Denmark (Andersen et al, 2020a) . that the Danish shutdown deterred Swedish consumers from spending in Denmark. However, the Swedes in our sample are not concentrated in Southern Sweden where access to Denmark is relatively easy, but spread out across the vast country. Before the pandemic, less than 1% of card spending by the Swedish individuals in our sample was through points of payment in Denmark. Figure 4 illustrates how the effect of the shutdown, the differential spending drop in Denmark relative to Sweden, varies by age group. 16 . The effect is negative for the youngest group (age 18-29): spending by this age group dropped around 10 percentage points more in Denmark than in Sweden. By contrast, the effect of the shutdown is positive for the oldest group (age 70+): spending by this age group dropped around 5 percentage points less in Denmark than in Sweden. In the intermediate age groups, the effect of the shutdown is generally moderately negative, sometimes statistically indistinguishable from zero.",

Under this interpretation, the social distancing laws put severe constraints on the spending choices of individuals with low health risk: this group would have spent significantly more during the pandemic if the availability of goods and services with high social proximity had not been restricted despite the higher prevalence of the virus. At the same time, the social distancing laws created a safer environment for consumption by individuals with high health risk: this group would have spent significantly less during the pandemic if the shutdown had not contained the virus despite the higher availability of goods and services. Figure 5 shows the age gradient in the effect of the shutdown for categories of spending involving high or moderate social proximity: retail (i.e., high-street shops and malls), social spending (i.e., food, drink and entertainment away from home), personal care (e.g., hairdressers and dentists) and public transport (i.e., trains and busses). 17 Across all four categories, we observe a clear age gradient: the effect of the shutdown is strongly negative for the young (low health risk) and less negative, sometimes even positive, for the old (high health risk).",

This illustrates, in a very concrete way, the mechanism through which social distancing can improve aggregate economic outcomes in a pandemic: by reducing the prevalence of the virus, it lowers the risk of contracting it in public transit and in retail shops, which stimulates the spending of individuals with a high underlying health risk. Second, we find that the shutdown in Denmark decreases spending among the young (aged under 29) by around 10 percent and increases the spending of the old (aged over 70) by almost 5 percent, relative to a counterfactual without restrictions and with higher disease risks. This finding suggests that lockdowns have the potential to improve aggregate economic outcomes by constraining the choices of low-risk individuals (the young) who would otherwise contribute most to the spread of the disease and thus inducing high-risk individuals (the old) to choose a higher level of economic activity and mobility.",

The figure shows weekly excess mortality in Denmark, Sweden and Italy for weeks 2 through 15 in 2020 (top panel) and excess Google searches for symptoms of illness (bottom panel) for the same period. Excess mortality for each country is calculated based on daily data on deaths sourced from Statistics Denmark (DST, Denmark), Statistics Sweden (SCB, Sweden) and ISTAT (Italy). Deaths data for Denmark and Sweden cover the whole population, whereas the Italian data is available for approximately half of all Communes. Excess mortality is calculated as the percentage difference between the total number of deaths from all causes in a week in 2020 and the average number of total deaths in that week, 2015-2019. Excess Google searches are calculated based on data from Google Trends of weekly indices of search intensity for the terms \"cough\" (DK: \"hoste\", SE: \"hosta\", IT: \"tosse\"), \"fever\" (\"feber\", \"feber\", \"febbre\"), \"sick\" (\"syg\", \"sjuk\", \"malato\"). Individual indices for each search term are summed in order to create a composite index of all terms. Excess Google searches are then calculated in the same way as for excess mortality. Figure 4 : Effect of the shutdown by age group. The figure shows the effect of the shutdown on total spending by age group, a measure of COVID-19 disease risk. Age-specific estimates of the shutdown effect are calculated as the difference between the estimated drop in consumer spending among that age group in Denmark and Sweden, with the Swedish sample weighted to match the socio-demographic composition of the Danish sample. Weights are based on 6 age groups (ages 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70+), sex, and quartiles of purchasing power parity (PPP) adjust permanent income. Confidence bounds at the 95% level (black vertical lines) are based on robust standard errors. Estimates of the country-specific effects on total spending for each age group are provided in Figure A4 in the Appendix. : Effect of the shutdown by age group on spending categories that vary by social proximity. The figure shows the effect of the shutdown by age group and across categories of offline spending that vary in their degree of social proximity.

Meetings of more than 500 people were outlawed on 11 March, falling to 50 people on 27 March. On 24 March the government restricted all bars, restaurants and cafes to table service only. Finally, on 1 April the government announced a set of guidelines including that individuals should keep distance from others in public and thathigh-risk groups, including over 70s, should avoid going shopping and meeting people.

We only impose the minimum monthly spending requirement until December 2019 as we want to allow for individual spending to fall to zero in response to the crisis. Second, individual spending is often partly on behalf of other household members, for example, a person might purchase flights from their personal account for themselves and their partner. In order to account for household structure, we use the bank's household identifiers -constructed from information on joint accounts and co-residence -in order to split all expenditures of couples on their personal and joint accounts across each spouse equally.11 Finally, in order to focus on comparable samples that vary only by government policy response to the pandemic, we limit our sample to individuals resident in either Denmark or Sweden as of December 2019. With these restrictions, our sample consists of around 860,000 people, with 760,000 people in Denmark and 100,000 people in Sweden.",

Column 1 reports statistics for the Danish subsample and Column 2 provides a comparison to the full adult population in Denmark, obtained from government registers.Our sample of 760,000 individuals is largely representative of the adult population of 4,600,000 in terms of gender, age, and income. This reflects that Danske Bank is the largest bank in Denmark, catering to all types of customers and with a significant presence in all parts of the country. Columns 3 and 4 report summary statistics for our Swedish subsample and a comparison to the full adult population in Sweden, again sourced from government registers.The Swedish subsample represents a significantly smaller share of the full population than the Danish subsample. This reflects the smaller relative market share of Danske Bank in Sweden.The Swedish subsample overrepresents those aged 30 to 59. The female share is consistent with that of the Swedish population and average income is slightly higher. Overall, the Swedish subsample is broadly similar to the Danish subsample and, crucially, contains large numbers of individuals across all ranges of demographics, allowing us to effectively control for possible confounding differences in response to the crisis.4 Empirical strategyThe main aim of the empirical analysis is to measure the change in consumer spending induced by the COVID-19 crisis in Denmark and Sweden and to isolate the impact of the shutdown in Denmark separately from the impact of the pandemic itself.Our unit of observation is individual-by-day, allowing us to capture sharp changes in spending as a result of the pandemic and the shutdown. The high frequency creates challenges, however, due to the strong cyclicality of spending over the week, the month, and the year. As in Andersenet al. (2020a), we address the cyclicality by comparing consumer spending on each day in 2020 to consumer spending on a reference day 364 days earlier. The reference day is always the same weekday and almost exactly the same place in the monthly and annual spending cycle. For example, we compare 17 January 2020 (a Friday) to the reference day 18 January 2019 (also a Friday). This method does not account for the fact that increases in spending around paydays may fall on different weekdays in different years, but this will not affect our key estimates as explained below. 13 For each individual in our sample and for each day of our window of analysis, we compute the difference between spending on the day itself and spending on the reference day the year before. Scaling with the average daily spending per person in the individual's country over a long period before the window of analysis, we obtain an individual-specific measure of excess spending on a given day expressed as a fraction of the normal level of spending per person in the country: excess spending ict = spending ict \u2212 spending ict\u2212364 average spending c where spending itc is spending on day t for individual i living in country c, and averagespending c is average daily spending per person in that country taken over all days in 2019. We measure the individual-level spending change over the COVID-19 crisis as the difference between average excess spending in the post-shutdown period, 11 March -5 April, and average excess spending in the early pre-shutdown period, 2 January -15 February: \u2206spending ic = E t [excess spending ict |t \u2208 post] average excess spending post-shutdown \u2212 E t [excess spending ict |t \u2208 pre] average excess spending pre-shutdownEquipped with this machinery, we measure the effect of the COVID-19 crisis in country c by averaging over individuals in our sample from that country:\u2206spending c = E i [\u2206spending ic ]Since excess spending is measured relative to average daily spending across all individuals, \u2206spending c measures the impact on aggregate spending relative to the 2019 baseline. With this measure, we effectively use excess spending in the pre-shutdown period as a counterfactual for excess spending in the post-shutdown period in each country. Simply put, we assume that yearover-year spending growth between 2019 and 2020 would have been the same after 11 March as before absent the epidemic and the shutdown. However, we exclude 16 February -11 March from the pre-shutdown period as early restrictions (e.g. on air travel to Asia) and anticipation of the broader crisis may have affected spending prior to the shutdown. While payday spending creates spikes in excess spending on individual days -positive when we compare a pay day to a normal day and negative when we do the opposite -they do not affect \u2206spending c because both its terms average over the same number of positive and negative pay day spikes.",

In both countries, there is a pronounced weekly cycle with spending spikes around weekends and in Denmark there is moreover a pay day cycle with large spikes around the end of the month where most employees receive their salaries. In the beginning of the window, before the pandemic reached Scandinavia, both the level and the cyclicality of spending are strikingly similar to the reference period in both countries. In Denmark, spending drops sharply around the shutdown on 11 March 2020 and remains below the level in the reference period, as indicated by the shaded area, throughout the window of analysis. In Sweden, spending drops sharply at almost the exact same time although no significant restrictions were imposed. Presumably, this",

We exploit a natural experiment to identify the effect of government restrictions separately from the impact of the virus and the health risks it entails: despite similar early experiences with the virus, the Danish government mandated social distancing to slow the spread of the disease while the Swedish government opted for a light-touch approach with a focus on voluntary recommendations. We present two key results. First, we estimate a massive reduction in consumer spending in both Denmark and Sweden around the date of the Danish lockdown. This drop consists of a common component to both countries of around 25 percent, and an additional drop in Denmark of just under 4 percentage points as a result of the shutdown. This finding suggests that the vast majority of the fall in economic activity in the COVID-19 crisis can be attributed to perceived disease risks influencing behaviour, rather than government restrictions.",
