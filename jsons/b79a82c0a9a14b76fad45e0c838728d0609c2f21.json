Clinical experience and professional training remain the bedrock for every healthcare practitioner, but guidance to support difficult decisions is needed. In an ideal world, there might be a series of definitive RCTs covering key areas such as who benefits from critical care admission and what are the risks of operating, or not operating? Even good-quality observational data would be helpful with all the caveats of confounding, association, and causation. To a large extent these are lacking for obvious reasons. So, healthcare workers and national organisations are trying to respond at great speed in a rapidly changing environment with the production and implementation of guidance. These are inevitably at best based on partial data, translation of theory and evidence from other situations, and collective wisdom.",

Whether this translates into a hierarchy of acceptance of such guidance is unclear. There is some evidence that in normal times for doctors, sources of influence from colleagues from the medical profession are judged as more legitimate than professional or medical associations. 4 We are not aware of empirical evidence of how healthcare professionals prioritise guidance in a crisis situation. There is inevitably a tension between a perceived need for military-style 'command and control' and the professional and individual autonomy to create and challenge centrally produced guidance.",

Guidance is often required precisely because the evidence base is weak, or conflicted, and can therefore act as a catalyst for better quality data. Guidance in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is coming out in days, and new versions of the same guidance days after that. The inevitable consequence will be that some is simply wrong, some is poorly written, and some is found to be wanting in hindsight. Duplication of effort and, perhaps worse, contradictory guidance, wastes time and energy and undermines trust. The corollary is that some good guidance will never see the light of day, be published too late, or be lost in the tidal wave of information overload we are all experiencing.",
