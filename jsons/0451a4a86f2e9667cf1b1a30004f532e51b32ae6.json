The Global Invasive Species Information Network is a consortium of organizations working toward providing seamless access to these disparate databases via the Internet. A distributed network of databases can be created using the Internet and a standard web service protocol. There are two options to provide this integration. First, federated searches are being proposed to allow users to search \"deep\" web documents such as databases for invasive species. A second method is to create a cache of data from the databases for searching. We compare these two methods, and show that federated searches will not provide the performance and flexibility required from users and a central cache of the datum are required to improve performance.",

Some existing portals, such as NISBase (http://www.nisbase.org), use a federated search, while others, such as GBIF (Global Biologic Information Facility; Edwards 2004) , cache data to improve performance. In a federated search, each time a user makes a request, all the individual databases are searched sequentially and the combined results presented ( Fig. 1(a) ) (Jacs\u00f3, 2004) . In a cached approach, key information describing the data from the databases is regularly queried and stored in a central location ( Fig. 1(b) ) (Fox et al., 2004) .

Both operations used the GISIN \"Occurrence\" data model representing the location of a species, its scientific name, and when it was identified.

The time to acquire 1000 records from local databases ranged from 0.5s to 7.4s for an average time of 1.9s (Table 5) . While the mean acquire times where close to federated searches, the maximum times where much smaller (Fig. 3 ). There were no failures from these databases and all the standard of deviations were less than one second. The count and search operations performed on a cache showed times to count the number of records available from a minimum of 1.10s to a maximum of 7.03s based on table sizes from 500000 to 16 million (Table 6 ). Times to request data from these databases varied from 0.45s to 0.48s (Table 7) . This translates to an average time to request 1000 records of about 0.45s. A simple query requesting all the data for a particular country was executed on the cache to determine performance under realistic searching. This query showed a sharp increase in the time to acquire 16 million records (44 seconds) (Fig. 4) . Fig. 2 Time, in seconds, to acquire a count and a search from two remote databases accessed through the Internet (FishBase and I3N) and one local database (NIISS) over the course of a week. The x-axis indicates the trial number with one trial executed per hour. To make the other results more visible on the graphs, the requests that timed out where removed from the graphs The cached performance is predicted to be about 0.5s. This shows a clear advantage for the cached system based on performance across a large number of providers (Fig. 4) . There is the possibility to improve a federated search with such approaches as querying multiple databases simultaneously but this would require additional complexity in managing the requests and integrating the results. Without further research into these approaches these results show the cached count, search, and query operations outperform the federated search in all cases except with small numbers of providers. This indicates that in a large network with end-users expecting fast access to data, a cache should be added to the system. Surprisingly, the maximum time for a search did not involve the remote database or the largest database, but instead was a local database with an intermediate amount of data. The NIISS database is a relatively complex relational database that was designed to communicate to the Web service through a \"View.\" A view in a database is a query that the database updates on a periodic basis. The other remote databases contained a single table that was mapped directly to the GISIN protocol. The local databases were all connected to the Web service through traditional SQL query statements. The cached searches were executed on the same databases, but on a single table. This result supports the idea of a cache to remove performance differences between databases related to database design and illustrates the need to work with providers to ensure their databases are connected in a manner that allows them to be accessed quickly. In addition, the results show that count operations took far longer than search operations and should not be included in protocols unless there is a clear requirement for them. Some Internet connection failures were expected, but not at the level found with the FishBase database in the Philippines. The FishBase information technology staff warned us that their Internet connection to the United States was not always reliable. This study showed that the connections between countries could be a serious problem with a federated database search. A cache can help with this problem because at least some version of the datum are readily available, and regular datum provider updates that fail can be programmed to retry until successful. The failures were almost synchronous (i.e., a count failed and then a search failed right afterward), and this may indicate that there are times when the Internet is more reliable than others. An additional problem for effective searches will be users in the Philippines and other countries accessing the cache if it is in the United States. This may require that the caches are replicated and distributed around the globe.",
