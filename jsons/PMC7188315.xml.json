Yet, there are no previous reports\nthat have specifically addressed Jordanian adult population awareness about influenza and\nits vaccine. In other Middle Eastern countries, several studies were performed to assess\nknowledge about influenza vaccine and vaccine acceptance among health care professionals,\nbut not knowledge about influenza illness and its vaccine among the general adult population\nor children (8\u201310). Other studies were\nimplemented worldwide to assess knowledge about influenza and its vaccine acceptance in\nchildren (11,12), adults (13) and GPs (14\u201316). Concerns about the safety and the efficacy of\ninfluenza vaccine\u2014and physician recommendation for having the vaccine\u2014were the most commonly\nreported determinants of influenza vaccine acceptance (8\u201316). Despite the presence of many worldwide surveys addressing this topic, till\ndate, we are not aware of any comprehensive study that has assessed the state of knowledge,\nawareness and practice of adult and children towards seasonal influenza and its vaccine in\nJordan, or in the Middle East. Therefore, the current cross-sectional study aims to identify\nthe major gaps in knowledge towards seasonal influenza, its routes of transmission and its\npreventative measures among the Jordanian population, and to identify the barriers against\nvaccine acceptance among adults and children in Jordan. The data generated from this study\ncould help in formulating strategies to help increasing awareness and acceptance of the\ninfluenza vaccine in Jordan. These could include assuring the population about the safety\nand the efficacy of the vaccine through multimedia and physician recommendation, offering\nthe vaccine for free, inclusion of the vaccine within the national immunization program for\nchildren and utilization of schools to provide the vaccine for children. Enhancing influenza\nvaccine acceptance among Jordanian population would result in national and global health\nbenefits in reducing the emergence and the spread of new variants of influenza viruses.",

Therefore, in this study, we examined other\ndeterminants that affect the decision of accepting or refusing vaccinations. In keeping\nwith previous reports (18,19), our results showed that physician recommendation was the most\nimportant cause of accepting the vaccine in those participants who have been previously\nvaccinated. Other factors such as concerns of catching H1N1, becoming severely ill because\nof influenza and protecting other family members were almost equally important. These\nfactors, which are associated with vaccine beneficial effects, were previously shown to be\nassociated with higher vaccination rate among adults in the USA (18). On the other hand, fear of getting ill after administering the\nvaccine and not considering influenza as a threat were the most commonly reported barriers\nagainst vaccination, followed by doubts about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. In\nline with that, Malosh et al. (18) reported that low perceived risk of infection and concern about vaccine\nsafety and efficacy were the most common reasons for not getting vaccinated in the USA.\nAlthough vaccine cost was not an important cause for refusing the vaccine, most of the\nparticipants in this study were more willing to get vaccinated in the future if the\nvaccine is offered for free by the government. In keeping with that, the cost of the\nvaccine has been previously reported as a possible barrier against influenza vaccine\nacceptance (6,17).",

In\naddition, in an epidemiology study conducted in Jordan, it was shown that 57% of\nhospitalized influenza-positive patients with severe acute respiratory infection cases,\nduring 2008\u201314, were children younger than 5 years (20). Hence, in this study, we examined parents\u2019 attitude towards their children\nbeing vaccinated. Similar to adult results, concerns about the safety and the efficacy of\nthe vaccine were the major barriers against child vaccination. In keeping with our\nresults, a previous study conducted in Jordan, to assesses Jordanian mothers\u2019 awareness of\nchildren vaccination in general, has been reported that ~40% of them were concerned about\nsafety of child vaccination in general (7). In\nother Middle Eastern countries, concern about vaccine safety was also a major factor that\nprevents health care workers from recommending the vaccine for their patients (8). Furthermore, the results of previous surveys\nconducted in the UK (12) and the USA (18) were also in line with other results, where the\nsafety and the efficacy of influenza vaccine were considered as the major factors that\ndetermine vaccine acceptance in children. The results of this survey revealed that the\nroles of both the physician and the government were also critical in increasing\nvaccination rate for this high-risk group. The government\u2019s role in this regard would\ninclude the incorporation of the vaccine within the national immunization program, as it\nhas not been a scheduled vaccine for children so far (6,7). The government\u2019s role would\nalso include assuring the population for the safety and the efficacy of the vaccine,\noffering the vaccine in the schools and for free. The critical role of the government and\nschools to improve vaccination of children was also emphasized in previous reports\nconducted in the UK (12).",
