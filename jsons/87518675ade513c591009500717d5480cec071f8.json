            "text": "India is endowed with fairly vast resources of rare earth elements (REE). Notwithstanding this, it has not been able to make its niche in global rare earth industry. India's share of rare earth oxide (REO) production is reported to be less than 2% of the total world production (Zangeneh 2018) . Nevertheless, with the passage of time spanning from 1950s to 2012, perceptible progress has been made from merely restricting in mining field to achieving capabilities of separating high purity REE (Zangeneh 2018) . The India's strength lies in adequate availability of certain individual rare earths, namely, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Y and Dy, that are much needed for making downstream products which have high market values (Singh 2019 (Singh , 2020 . Accordingly, it is imperative to resort to volarisation of these elements. The most prominent intermediate products are permanent magnets that are needed in diverse fields, such as, industrial and consumer electronics, automotive, medical and aerospace (Zangeneh 2018) . In addition to use for strategic purposes in aerospace and defence, the fast growths of automobile and electronics industries, and currently sustained thrust for clean energy, have accentuated requirements of more permanent magnets. Prominent global share of NdFeB magnet production is by China and Japan (90%), with some by Europe (Germany, UK and France), USA and Canada (Zangeneh 2018) . It is believed that ease of availability of raw materials is the main reason for China's dominance in production amongst Asian countries, whereas Japan imports 82% rare earths from China (Zangeneh 2018) . In this chapter, the relative merits and potential of the several REE sources for future development and directions for larger inputs in exploration, on the one hand and the utilization of the industrial sources, on the other have been evaluated in Indian context.",

            "text": "The relative commercial potentialities of various Indian REE deposits/occurrences described in preceding chapters are tentatively categorised. Deposits/occurrences, as assessed from existing knowledge, are presented in sequence of deposits of high commercial potential, and then of medium/small/unknown potential in that order (Table 10 .1). While this categorisation is purely suggestive, yet certain parameters have been guiding factors in this attempt. Areas where exploration inputs are more with reasonable degree of confidence have been categorised as deposits of \"High commercial potential\" and may be considered for immediate commercial mining. In certain cases, additional inputs are needed before they are taken up for mining. Other categorisations, e.g., \"Medium\", \"Small\" and \"Unknown\" are based on mainly some preliminary signatures, like favourable geological settings, anomalous values of one or more than one individual rare earth elements, follow up work, grades of REE values, their dimensions/reserves or a combination of these, with some assumptions. In many cases of \"High\", \"Medium\", \"Small\" and \"Unknown\" resources, data is scanty, fragmentary, and exploration is not done with REE orientation particularly in the last three in decreasing order. Work on the envisaged industrial process residues (secondary) is in initial stages and without further focussed work, commercial recovery of REE cannot be planned. Although available limited results from sea floor bed/mud are quite encouraging, further work is needed. Also, it is kept under special class of natural resources keeping in mind involvement of International Seaboard Authority on United Nations. All classes, especially medium, small and unknown, need adequate exploration inputs and based on the results relative positions of commercial significance can be modified accordingly (Table 10 .1). By further exploration work, some of them may be converted into commercially exploitable resources. The most promising deposits for light rare earths are contained in the beach sands and carbonatite complexes of western India ( Fig. 10 .1). These are good sources of monazites and bastnaesites and associated minerals rich in light REE (LREE). Inland stream placers in central India, rich in xenotime and some hydrothermal xenotime deposits of SSZ, including Kanyaluka ( Fig. 10 .1), form good resources of heavy REE (HREE). So these form major immediate targets for commercial exploitation. However, before initiating commercial mining, flowsheet needs to be developed for economic recovery of REE in the case of carbonatite-hosted REE deposits. ",

Known stream placer occurrences should be investigated by sustained exploration inputs involving systematic surveying, stream/soil sampling, panning and gravity and magnetic beneficiation to convert them to a mineable resources. This effort will help maintaining chain of stream placer commercial mining, processing, extraction and value addition.

At present, the rare earth production in India through IREL (India) Limited comes mainly from commercial exploitation of beach placers located in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha coasts. In addition, Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India, is also recovering xenotime-bearing polymineral concentrates (7-8 t per year) from stream placers in Jashpur district, Chhattisgarh, central India (Verma 2019a) . Stream placer mining yields both heavy and light rare earths, dominated by light rare earths. Processing of monazite by IREL (India) Limited, recovered from beach sand deposits, yields mostly light rare earths, dominated mainly by Ce, La, Nd in decreasing order. Additionally, it also produces value added rare-earth compounds (viz. carbonates of cerium and lanthanum, oxalates of neodymium, praseodymium, yttrium, samarium, gadolinium) and other strategic materials (viz. uranium and thorium salts) from monazite. The products of IREL (India) Limited find applications in diverse industries, namely, paints and pigments, ceramics, foundries, abrasives, construction, electronics, automobiles, chemicals, metals and alloys, aircraft, satellite launch vehicles, healthcare and nuclear power (www.irel.co.in). The production of beach sand minerals by IREL (India) Limited was 309,240 t during 2017-18, as against 305,041 t during 2016-17, through its OSCOM (Odisha) and Chavara (Kerala) Units; whereas the Manavalakuruchi Unit (Tamil Nadu) resumed production activities from May 2018 after getting environment clearance (IREL 2018) .

Notwithstanding non-uniform categorisation of REE applications, rare earth market is generally classified into nine domains, e.g., catalysts, polishing, glass, phosphors and pigments, metallurgy, batteries, magnets, ceramics, and others. Out of 119,650 t of estimated global REO consumption in 2015, spread of consumption in various sectors in decreasing order is catalysts (24%), magnets (23%), polishing (12%), other applications (9%), 8% each in metallurgy and batteries, glass (7%), ceramics (6%) and phosphors and pigments (3%) (Zhou et al. 2017) . With sustained focus for augmenting preferentially clean energy, e.g., electric vehicles, wind power turbines, energy-efficient lighting, and calatytic converters, global requirement for REE, including in India, would continue to maintain upward growth in coming decades. This situation is going to accentuate more and more challenges for maintaining uninterrupted supply chain of REE. It is going to be more so in light of India's resolve to a target of 170 GW of renewables by 2022, comprising 100 GW of solar energy, 60 GW of wind energy and 10 GW of hydropower. Furthermore, under the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP), the target set by India is 6-7 million units of EVs by 2020; sale of~0.8 billion LED bulbs by 2019 (Kumar and Bharadwaj 2018) . Additionally, renewables will have a 40% share of energy mix by 2030, including goal to have near-complete electrification of surface transport in the coming 15-20 years ( Fig. 10.2 Individual rare earth elements specific global demand for REO, which is equally applicable for India also, is shown ( Fig. 10.4) . To cope up with the clean energy growth, projected demand for Nd is going to be doubled to more than 40,000 t of Nd oxide by 2030; followed by Dy and Ce oxides (Fig. 10.4) . Current level of requirements for La oxide may remain more or less horizontal, with marginal decrease in growing demand for Y, Eu and Tb oxides. Although requirement of REE in lighting market is anticipated to reduce gradually, the REE demand for wind turbines, electric vehicles and NiMH batteries is likely to keep growing (Zhou et al. 2017) . Accordingly, with projected decrease in lighting market in coming years, envisaged criticality of Eu, Tb and Y may not be sustained with reference to their supply (Fig. 10.5; Binnemans et al. 2018) , whereas Nd and Dy are likely to become critical, especially Dy, in terms of supply scenario (Fig. 10.5) . However, supply of remaining various rare earth oxides required in other industries (Fig. 10. 3) may not be adversely affected. Thus maintaining availability of Nd and Dy may pose challenges Note relatively high supply risk for dysprosium and terbium, compared to neodymium, europium and yttrium (after Binnemans et al. 2018) to ensure their supply for green energy field alone. Global production data reveals that out of total REE market value, 62.5% is shared by LREE and remaining 37.5% is accounted for by HREE (Zhou et al. 2017) .",

            "text": "In Indian scenario, Nd supply can be sustained by processing monazites hosted in beach placers deposits of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala (Table 10 .1; Fig. 10.1) . On an average, monazites from these deposits contain more than 10% Nd oxide (Singh 2020) . Furthermore, once commercial mining starts additional supply of Nd can also come from carbonatites of Amba Dongar and Kamthai (Table 10 .1; Fig. 10 .1), as they contains Nd oxides in the range of 0.13-1.2 wt%. Individual REE minerals hosted in Kamthai carbonatites contain up to >5.0 wt% Nd oxide. Processing of monazites hosted in stream placers of Chhotanagpur Granite Gneiss Complex terrain, central India (Table 10 .1; Fig. 10 .1), with average 8.8% Nd oxide content, can also supplement Nd supply. The supply for still more scarce and critical rare earth element, Dy, may be regulated through major resources contained in stream placers of central India and upcoming peralkaline granites and associated tuffs of Siwana Ring Complex in Western India (Table 10 .1; Fig. 10 .1). Xenotimes from Siri stream placers and Kanyaluka contain~4.5 wt% Dy oxide, whereas peralkaline granites of Rajasthan revealed 0.025-0.05 wt% Dy oxides. Apart from Dy, these resources would take care of supply for remaining individual heavy rare earths needed by other different industries. The LREE and HREE resources required for other products (Fig. 10 .3) would continue to come from the existing and future possible REE resources. Needless to say that substantial resources of REE established in India is in the form of monazite contained in heavy mineral sand in coastal beach placers that form a vast resource of LREE (12.47 million tonnes as on March 2017; Mohapatra 2019a, b) . This resource may take care of entire LREE requirements of most of the industries (Fig. 10.2 and 10 .3). Huge resources of garnet (187 million tonnes; Mohapatra 2019a, b) and zircon (36 million tonnes; Mohapatra 2019a, b) should be assessed for potentiality for low grade REE resources. Together both may also help to some extent to overcome balance problem of individual REE.",

This would also help in containing monopoly of China in global rare earth supply chain, for which other major stakeholder countries are also making more stronger their individual indigenous exploration, extraction, processing and manufacturing abilities. Significantly, US and Canada have also recently signed Memorandum of Understanding for critical materials to lessen reliance on China for rare earth supply (REAI News 2020a). Furthermore, it is envisaged that US even plans to hoard rare earth magnets, namely, neodymium magnets, worth tens of millions of dollars (REAI News 2020a).

The ease of exploitation is commonly dictated by favourable geological setting, ore grade, tonnage, existing processing technology, costs and attendant environmental concerns including local people. These aspects need to be assessed properly before commencing exploitation. Apart from strengthening downstream sector, upstream sector also need to be developed for identifying and quantifying additional natural resources to sustain \"Rare Earth Industry Chain\". This endeavour may also involve innovative groups at the interface of information technology and the minerals, metals and materials engineering domains (cf. Pradip et al. 2019) . Assessment of effective recovery of REE and associated metals from industrial wastes and mine dumps, comprising 'Technospheric mining', should continue to receive focussed attention. The indigenous manufacturing of intermediate products need to be augmented with matching progressive growth of technological advancements. Industrially speaking, promotion of the \"Rare Earth Industry\" should be an integral part of the present programme of \"Make in India\" (Singh 2019) . In this regard, a beginning can be made by the AMD-IREL-BARC-NFC-DMRL-ARCI combine. To achieve this goal, several of the industrial partners like Aluminium extraction, Thermal Power Plants, Fertiliser Plants, different Mining Agencies and Steel Plants can also be involved as partners. Also, India can promote its ties with countries, as has been established now with Japan for improving its domain knowledge and new technologies for both upstream and downstream processes of the \"Indian Rare Earth Industry\".

Both are integral parts of end-use demand/market, as for example, electric vehicles, acoustic transducer, wind turbines, medical devices and military applications. Although India has proven professional skill both in upstream and downstream domains, but it manifests relatively less in downstream domain of rare earth value chain where expertise appears to be limited to lab-scale in the manufacturing of intermediate products (cf.Kumar and Bharadwaj 2018). Possibly manufacturing of intermediate products is done to the extent to meet only inhouse organisational strategic requirements. Non-availability of intermediate products in open market causes imbalance in downstream sector and builds up price pressure. As commercial products of existing technologies have not reached to open market, manufacturing of intermediate products require to be accelerated through technological innovation in downstream domain.",
