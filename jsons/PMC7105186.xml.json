Traditionally, its root and rhizome have been used for the treatment of inflammation, cough, tonsillitis and pharyngitis [1]. More recently, it has been used to fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Therefore, I. tectorum has been listed as therapeutical treatments appeared on the list of treatment therapy, and has caught some doctor's attention as it helps people fight against this new infectious disease. Many studies on chemical compounds have revealed that I. tectorum contains a variety of important chemicals, such as isoflavones [2], [3], [4], quinones [5] and triterpenoids [6], [7], [8]. These chemical compounds are believed to be responsible for a number of biological activities of anti-atherosclerosis [9], anti-oxidant [10] and anti-tumor [11]. Meanwhile, these isoflavone compounds are also often used for the quality control of I. Tectorum.",

The five different solvents (methanol; NaCl, 0.5 M; [C4MIM]BF4,0.5 M; [C6MIM]Br, 0.5 M and [C8MIM]Br, 0.5 M) were tested under the same condition using the same protocol (dried roots: 0.2 g, extraction time: 30 min, solvent to solid ratio: 50 ml/g). The results were summarized in Fig. 3\n. Clearly, [C8MIM]Br, 0.5 M produced the highest extraction yields of tectoridin (34.12 mg/g), iristectorin B (2.64 mg/g) and iristectorin A (5.09 mg/g) derived from the dried roots, and the [C6MIM]Br, 0.5 M and methanol ran the second and third best with respect to the efficiency of the extraction yields, respectively. These results could be attributed to the fact that increasing the alkyl chain length from butyl to octyl decreased the water miscibility of the ILs [28].

However, the differences in the yields of tectoridin, iristectorin B and iristectorin A were not significant (p\n > 0.05) when the extraction time went up from 30 to 50 min.

As a result, there was no obvious yield change following the extended extraction time. Hence, 30 min was determined as the optimum extraction time.",

Under the optimized ILUAE conditions, the highest extraction yields of tectoridin, iristectorin B and iristectorin A were 37.45, 2.88 and 5.28 mg/g, respectively. Tectoridin, iristectorin B and iristectorin A in the ILUAE extracts have been separated and purified successfully by HSCCC. This approach resulted in 60.21 mg tectoridin, 4.33 mg iristectorin B and 8.24 mg iristectorin A isolated from 400 mg ILUAE extract of I. tectorum dried roots using one-step elution within 5 h. These results indicated that the combination of application of ILUAE and HSCCC is a very powerful technique for the preparative extraction and purification of tectoridin, iristectorin B and iristectorin A from I. tectorum dried roots.",
