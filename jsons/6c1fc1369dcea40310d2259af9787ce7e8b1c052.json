Bacillus thuringiensis (BT) produces crystalline parasporal inclusions during sporulation which are pathogenic to insect larvae, and to dipteran larvae in particular for the var. israelensis strain (Goldberg and Margalit 1977 ; Thomas and Ellar 1983; Ellar et al. 1986; Anon. 1987; Hofte and Whiteley 1989; Ellar 1988a,b, 1989; Guillet et al. 1990; Chilcott et al. 1990; Webb 1992; Aronson 1993) . Ideally, the control strategy would be one of integrated pest management but in practice BTI has been used wherever particular chemical insecticides have become ineffective, due to the development of resistance, or outlawed as a consequence of ecological concerns. Bacillus thuringiensis strains active against lepidopteran crop pests have found widespread use in the developed world, notably in North America, and particularly in ecologically sensitive environments. New strains active against coleopteran and nematode pests have been isolated recently (Krieg et al. 1983; Donovan el al. 1988; Rupar et a/. 1991; Aronson 1993) . It is the dipteran-specific varieties of B. thuringiensis, however, that have captured the imagination internationally because of the benefits obtained through the use of BTI by the OCP and other programmes (Goldberg and Margalit 1987; Anon. 1987; Drobniewski and Ellar 1989; Guillet et a/. 1990; Webb 1992; Drobniewski 1993a) .",

In the diagnostic laboratory differentiating between Bacillus species can be difficult although discrimination based on a combination of morphological characters, and the API 20E and API 50 CHB test strips (bio Merieux) can be quite successful (Logan and Berkeley 1984; Bryant et al. 1985; Logan et a/. 1985) .

Although a large number of phenotypic tests are used to distinguish between species, in practice sometimes only a single feature is used to separate them, such as the crystalline parasporal inclusion of B. thuringiensis. Not all strains produce crystals, however, and crystalliferous mutants occur readily, as a result of the loss of toxin-encoding plasmids (Gonzalez et al. 1981) , producing organisms that are practically indistinguishable from B . cereus. Indeed, if B . cereus is co-cultured with B . thuringiensis it can be converted to crystal toxin production through plasmid transfer (Gonzalez et al. 1982) . Most BT toxin genes are plasmid encoded as, for example, are the genes for anthrax toxin and other Bacallus virulence determinants (Kramer and Gilbert 1989; Turnbull et al. 1990 ). Extrachromosomal DNA comprises 1&20% of the total potential coding capacity of BT (Aronson 1993) and little is known of its function. Plasmid exchange occurs readily between Bacillus species and this may alter the specificity of non-pathogenic BT strains increasing their potential to cause disease in man. Non-toxic polypeptide factors may also significantly influence toxicity and specificity, for example, BTI encodes a 20 kDa polypeptide which stabilizes the 25 kDa cytolytic toxin (Visick and Whiteley 1991) . Combining these features may create more useful larvicidal agents or synergistic new toxin combinations either naturally or through recombinant DNA techniques; however, the safety of these new combinations cannot be guaranteed.",

            "text": "The majority of these toxins have a molecular weight of 65 to 135 kDa and over 40 toxins have been cloned, expressed in other bacteria and plants, and sequenced (recently reviewed by Aronson (1993) and Hofte and Whiteley (1989) ). From sequence and toxicity data a classification scheme was formulated (Hofte and Whiteley 1989) in which there were 13 'CRY' or crystal groups which were homologous but which exhibited toxicity against different target larvae. Zn vitro these activated toxins were cytolytic to cells from the target and related larval species. A fourteenth 'CYT' group was created for a 27 kDa toxin from the var. isruelensis crystal, which by contrast was mosquitocidal, haemolytic and cytolytic to many mammalian and insect cell lines, but which did not share sequence homol-ogy with CRY toxins (Ellar et al. 1985; Hofte and Whiteley 1989) . I t has become apparent that the CYT designation can be applied to a broader group that includes at least five hydrophobic proteins which share the above properties : the 27 kDa protoxins (processed to an active toxin of 25 kDa) of BTI and var. morrisoni PG14 (Ward et al. 1986; Earp and Ellar 1987; Chilcott and Ellar 1988) ; the 28 kDa protoxin of var. darmstadiensis 73-E10-2 which is processed to a 23 kDa toxin (Drobniewski and Ellar 1989) ; the 25 kDa protoxin of var. kyushuensis which forms an active toxin of 23 kDa (Knowles et al. 1992) ; and probably, the 27 kDa toxin of var. jukuokaensis (Yu r't al. 1991) . The var. israelensis and var. morrisoni 27 kDa toxins have been cloned and sequenced and differ by only one nucleotide (Earp and Ellar 1987; Galjart et al. 1987 ). However, a change in only a few key amino acids has a significant effect on the insect specificity of the toxin (Haider and . The CYT toxins of var. darmstadiensis and var. kyushuensis are immunologically related, and in common with the var. isruelensis 27 kDa toxin can be neutralized by, and release entrapped markers from, phospholipid containing liposomes (Gill et al. 1987; Ellar 1988a, 1989; Yu et al. 1991; Knowles et al. 1992) . The mode of action at the molecular level has been facilitated by the purification, or cloning, of individual cytolytic toxins, in place of solubilized crystal mixtures. Activated crystal toxin extracts (Ellar et d. 1986; Knowles and Ellar 1987; Drobniewski and Ellar 1988a) , and more significantly purified toxins (Chilcott and Ellar 1988; Ellar 1988a,b, 1989) bind to insect cell membranes forming transmembrane oligomeric pores of 1 nm radius initially, leading to an influx of electrolytes and water, and colloid-osmotic lysis. Planar lipid bilayer experiments indicate that the toxins form cation-selective channels (Knowles 1992) . The CRY toxins are believed to act in the same way (although this has been fiercely debated) displaying saturable binding to specific membrane receptors, which have been identified on culture cells in uitro and on mid-gut epithelium in vivo Wolfersberger el al. 1987; Hofmann et al. 1988; Wolfersberger 1990; Van Rie et al. 1990; Garczynski et al. 1991) . The crystal structure of a coleopteran specific toxin at 2.5 A resolution has been described (Li et al. 1991) reinforcing the view that the toxins have distinct functional domains, and that conserved hydrophobic regions, and conformational changes in amphipathic helices, are important for toxin insertion and pore formation in membranes (Ellar et al. 1985 Aronson 1993) .",

In man, listeriolysin 0, the thiol-activated cytolysin of Listeria monocytogenes, has a role in resisting phagocytic destruction of the organism (Bielecki et al. 1990 ).

There was no direct evidence for infection as no replication occurred (Siegel and Shadduck 1990a,b) and the mortality could be explained by the elaboration of bacterial waste metabolites in sensitive areas of the brain. Local abscesses have been noted on subcutaneous injection of BTI but these may have been related simply to persistence of foreign antigen as autoclaved material produced the same effect. These experiments may be relevant in that B. cereus, which is a human pathogen, can produce cerebral and wound abscesses (Turnbull et al. 1990; Drob-niewski 1993b) . Morbidity and mortality were virtually absent from aerosol, oral or intraperitoneal administration of different BTI formulations. BTI spores remained viable in mammalian tissue for lengthy periods of time, however, and their isolation is likely to increase wherever these agents are used (Allen and Wilkinson 1969; Siegel and Shadduck 1990a) .",

Bacillus species are common laboratory contaminants of blood cultures with estimates varying from 0.1 to 0.9% of submitted cultures (Pearson 1970) , and are frequently present in mixed culture, as when isolated from wound specimens for example, making interpretation of their clinical significance difficult. The retrieval of B. thuringiensis var. isruelensis and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus from an infection after an accidental inoculation injury illustrates this point; proteases from the latter organism could have produced toxin activation under what might be very rare conditions (Warren et al. 1984) . Severe systemic illness caused by the closely-related B. cereus is primarily associated with intravenous drug abusers, the immunosuppressed, those with underlying malignancies and neonates. Combining any of these factors potentially increases this risk. Immunosuppression is not uncommon in West Africa because of the high prevalence of chronic parasitological diseases such as malaria, and the prevalence of immunosuppressive diseases, particularly measles, in early infancy. One can speculate that this might predispose individuals to opportunistic B T I infections that would not occur in the immunocompetent.",

T h e number of reported cases is tiny, although this is probably an underestimate due to inadequate diagnostic laboratory facilities, failure to speciate Bacillus isolates, the mixed microbiological nature of some clinical specimens, and the rejection of clinically significate isolates as contaminants. T h e widespread use of B. rhuringiensis var. isruelensis and the ubiquitous nature of Bacillus species suggest that the risk to public health remains extremely small, particularly in comparison to the benefit accrued to a community. It would nevertheless be prudent for clinical isolates, particularly from ocular lesions in which Bacillus species have a distinct pathogenic role, and which might be missed against the background of for example, onchocerciasis-generated blindness, to be carefully evaluated for the presence of var. isruelensis wherever this agent has been widely used. At present there is no good evidence to discontinue the use of B. thuringiensis in the developed and developing world on grounds of risk to human health. T h e introduction of new varieties and toxin mixtures, such as those derived from recombinant techniques, should not be assumed safe on the basis of previous work and should be carefully evaluated. T h e pathogenic role of B. sphaericus may be a greater hinderance to its more widespread use at the present time. Prospective or retrospective studies would be needed to confirm the safety of any new agent, or combination of agents, so that an adequate assessment of the risk-to-benefit ratio can be obtained. New formulations also contain emulsifiers and dispersal agents which should be assessed for human toxicity as well.",
