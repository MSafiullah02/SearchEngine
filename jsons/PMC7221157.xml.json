Unfortunately, we do not yet have weight, height, and waist circumference data for all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, and, therefore, we cannot disentangle the effects of adiposity on lung function and immune response to viral infection. Excess body weight and increased visceral adiposity are habitually associated with metabolic alterations such as insulin dysregulation, high fasting glucose levels, hyperlipidemia, or systemic hypertension, which cause dysregulation of the immune system through mediation in various immune, metabolic, and thrombogenic responses. However, the clinical impact of this immune dysregulation on susceptibility to and severity and outcome of viral infections and on lung function is not yet clearly understood (11, 12).",

In line with this observation, reports indicate abundant expression of ACE2 in absorptive enterocytes of the GI tract (25) and diarrhea as among the most frequent infection symptoms (26). Inflammation of intestinal mucosa may result in increased intestinal permeability with a consequent cascade of events that cause persistent inflammation, worsening the infection-related symptoms. Immune homeostasis is a dynamic process maintained by a complex interplay between the gut microbiota and host mucosal immune system (27). Dysbiosis, defined as imbalances in gut microbial species, is now a well-recognized factor in the pathogenesis of age-associated frailty (28). It is possible that COVID-19 mortality is increased in older patients with comorbidities associated with intestinal dysbiosis, as this could support systemic chronic inflammation in the host. Nonetheless, only future studies will clarify this aspect.",

In particular, the administration of several plant-derived polyphenols to in vitro cultured immune cells suppressed the release of inflammatory cytokines (44). Traditional Chinese herbal medicines for influenza treatment demonstrated potential antiviral activity (45, 46). Polyphenol bioavailability has been long discussed, as many have observed health benefits, but few have observed circulating traces of bioactive compounds (47, 48). Nonetheless, exposure of the epithelial barrier to a polyphenol-rich environment can efficiently activate local immune suppression and tissue repair mechanisms (49), and systemic benefits may be related to the release of circulating microRNA, defined as small non-coding RNA molecules, with anti-inflammatory effects (50). Indeed, even if orally introduced, bioactive dietary factors induce miRNA synthesis, these are packaged into exosomes and released into the bloodstream to act systemically (51). Dietary factors are emerging as anti-inflammatory miRNA promoters able to regulate metabolic functions, inflammation, and oxidation systemically (52\u201355). Furthermore, herb extracts may combine antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity, and tissue-repair properties (56, 57) (Figure 1).",

Moreover, mild energy restriction is recommended for obese and obese-diabetic patients (15). Most of these dietary targets can be met in our country by means of the well-known and traditionally familiar Mediterranean diet (61, 62), which is rich in polyphenols with immune-protective and anti-inflammatory activities, playing an adjuvant role in both prophylaxis and therapy (61). The scientific community is already discussing how to manage future epidemic outbreaks by learning from the current experience (63).
