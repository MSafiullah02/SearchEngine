Objective: To investigate the viral load of WUPyV in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), stool, and serum samples of pediatric patients with acute respiratory tract diseases. Study design: We established a real-time PCR for WUPyV DNA and tested NPA obtained between 2002 and 2007 from pediatric in-patients with acute respiratory tract diseases. In addition, 14 stool and 14 serum samples of children with WUPyV DNA positive NPA were analysed. Results: WUPyV DNA was found in 5.2% of 1232 NPA. The median viral load in the NPA was 950 copies/ml (maximum 3.4E10 copies/ml). The WUPyV load in NPA was neither associated with the coinfection status nor with the clinical diagnoses. WUPyV DNA was found in 3 of 14 serum samples and in 2 of 14 stool samples. The WUPyV load in NPA tended to be higher in viremic children. Conclusion: WUPyV DNA was found in NPA, serum, and stool of hospitalised children with acute respiratory tract diseases. Further studies are necessary to determine whether WUPyV is a human pathogen.",

            "text": "Respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of human morbidity and are mainly caused by viruses. Molecular methods have enabled the detection of a number of unknown viruses in respiratory tract samples such as several coronaviruses as well as the human bocavirus (hBoV). [1] [2] [3] Most recently, two novel viruses of the family polyomaviridae were detected in respiratory samples and named KI polyomavirus 4 and WU polyomavirus (WUPyV). 5 Two human polyomaviruses were known before, the JC and BK polyomavirus. These viruses cause persisting infections, which are usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals but may lead to severe disease under immunosuppression. 6 In the first description of WUPyV, DNA was detected in 37 obtained from adults and children in the United States. 5 Most of the WUPyV DNA positive patients (86%) were younger than 4 years of age. Strikingly, coinfections were detected in 72% of the patients. Meanwhile, similar findings of WUPyV detection have been reported from South Korea, Canada, Scotland, the United States, and Germany with prevalence rates ranging from 1.6% to 7%. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Because WUPyV DNA was also detected in samples of a control group without respiratory symptoms, the clinical relevance of positive WUPyV DNA results in respiratory samples has been questioned. 11 Rather, positive WUPyV DNA results in the respiratory tract may constitute an incidental detection of a persistent virus. However, further investigations are necessary to clarify this issue. The initial studies on WUPyV infections have mostly used conventional single-round PCR for WUPyV detection. In order to facilitate WUPyV DNA analysis and to quantify WUPyV DNA in clinical samples, we designed a real-time PCR assay. Quantification of WUPyV DNA may be important with respect to the pathogenic relevance of positive WUPyV DNA results, as has been suggested for hBoV. 12 In the present study, we describe the evaluation of the WUPyV real-time PCR and its application for the detection of WUPyV DNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs). In addition, we studied stool and serum samples of children with WUPyV DNA positive NPA.",

The aspirates were collected using a catheter tube and an aspiration trap. After suction the tube was rinsed with sterile saline. All samples had been tested for the presence of antigens of adenovirus, influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by immunofluorescence assay and for the presence of hBoV DNA as described previously. 13 In addition, archived stool and serum samples of children with positive WUPyV DNA in NPA were tested if they were obtained no longer than 14 days before or after the NPA.

After analysis of discrepant results between the qualitative and the real-time PCR assay by repeat-testing and by additional PCR assays in different genome regions, two samples remained that were positive only in the real-time assay (110 and 140 copies/ml) and one sample that was positive only in the qualitative assay. Overall, the frequency of WUPyV DNA detection in our study population was 5.2% with the real-time PCR assay. The median viral load of all WUPyV positive NPA was 9.5 \u00d7 10 2 copies/ml. The maximum value was 3.4 \u00d7 10 10 copies/ml. Twenty-two (34.4%) of the positive samples had viral loads below the 95% limit of detection (360 copies/ml). A comparison of WUPyV loads with respect to the clinical diagnosis did not reveal any significant differences (p = 0.98 by Kruskal-Wallis test; Fig. 1 ). In 32 (50%) of the WUPyV positive NPA, evidence of infection with other respiratory viruses was detected. The median WUPyV loads of the Fig. 1 .

While very high viral loads of greater than 10 9 copies/ml were found in a small proportion (4.7%) of the WUPyV DNA positive NPA, the majority of these samples (51.6%) contained only low viral loads of less than 1000 copies/ml. Although the significance of viral load results in NPA is limited to some extent because of technical variations in the acquisition procedure (e.g. the volume of the NPA on arrival in the lab ranged approximately from 1 to 10 ml), the observed viral loads in patient samples differed by a factor of 10 8 , a range much larger than could be accounted for by variation in NPA volumes obtained. In analogy to hBoV, 16 the observed WUPyV load distribution is compatible with primary WUPyV infection associated with high viral loads in few of the children and incidental detection of low copy numbers of persistent virus in most of the children.",
