The efficacy of this method can be tested in a randomized controlled study clinically. In the high risk group of patients, individuals with the prophylaxis can be compared with the individuals without prophylaxis. Ideally there would be three experimental groups: placebo, hydroxychloroquine alone, and hydroxychloroquine with IFN \u03b1-2b. Rate of infection and severity of symptoms can be compared between all three groups. Due to the low side effect profile of chloroquine and IFN \u03b1-2b, the benefit to risk ratio of using chloroquine and IFN \u03b1-2b to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV2 and COVID-19 could be enormous.",

Bernstein analyzed all published cases and Food and Drug Administration reports of retinopathy induced by hydroxychloroquine. He concluded that there is no evidence of permanent visual-field scotomas occurring when the daily dose did not exceed 6.5 mg/kg body weight for maintenance therapy [17]. The dosage we are proposing is 12.5% to 25% of the dosage used in the long term treatment. Thus, the rate of side effects should be significantly lower, especially in short period of use.",
