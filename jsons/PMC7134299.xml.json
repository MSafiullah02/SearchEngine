In developing countries, young people need to have certain skills (for example, effective use of text editors and spreadsheets) in order to get a better job. In developed countries, society is clearly becoming more digital, providing many new digital services, some for very basic services like to get a doctor appointment, at a fast pace. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable people are often left behind. Many seniors, migrants and minorities are suffering social exclusion due to their lack of digital literacy, Thus, large segments of the population lacks the necessary skills to interact effectively with such digitalized services",

However, often such face-to-face training activities has limited effectiveness. The typical training in groups has many problems: logistics (participants with different time availability) and pedagogical (participants with different learning speed) problems, and teachers are sometimes ill-equipped to deal with individuals not only experiencing digital illiteracy but also experiencing low literacy in general. Of course, there are many qualified teachers but, in general, scaling such face-to-face training activities to be able to train big sectors of a population is very costly in terms of the human resources needed; in general it is simply not a sustainable activity. In addition when the trainees are located in rural or remote areas the human resources needed (teachers) may not be available in sufficient quantities. In developing countries typically both problems occur, i.e., too high training costs, and limited availability of qualified teachers.",

In the practical studies we have conducted (see Sect. 3) assuring that the practical necessities for conducting the literacy training (e.g., availability of working computers, access to literacy training material) are met is the responsibility of a local training coordinator, who does not need to be familiar with the literacy training material.Use of a two-screen approach: The methodology follows a learning-by-doing approach where the trainee is presented with two screens: (i) one, typically a tablet, where the training material, a number of videos, is shown and (ii) a second one, typically a desktop computer, used by the trainee to practice the practical exercises shown in the first screen. The benefits of using dual screens has been studied in a number of works, e.g., [4, 7].Adapting training material to the trained group: When training diverse populations the training material used should be localised, e.g., in general with respect to languages utilised, with respect to literacy levels, etc. In general such a localisation (e.g., in the website domain [11]) process typically consists of a translation to a language and a cultural adaptation. In our methodology, both the language used for instructions, and the video speed, is adapted to the trained groups: (i) Language adaptation: normally the videos are in the native language of the trainees. However, in the case of migrants, they may choose to either receive instructions in their native language or in the language of the country they currently reside; (ii) Age adaptation: for instance, the speed of the videos is slower for elderly people than for younger people; (iii) Literacy adaptation: for instance, the language in the video is \u201csimpler\u201d for people with low literacy than for other with higher levels of literacy; (iv) Gender adaptation, for instance, we use inclusive language;(v) Technology literacy adaptation: for many trainees the use of our training setup comprising tablets and desktop computers can be their first contact with such technological equipment; we have extensive experiences with adapting training material with regards to such concerns.As an example, in the training of young women in Kenya with reduced school experience, the videos played rapidly, but the language used was simplified, and adapted to their gender, and level of technological literacy.Use of specially developed software training applications: We have developed a number of new software training applications to ensure that the interactions with the training application is intuitive, providing a controlled environment specifically adapted to users without digital background.\n",

However, in practice it was deemed necessary to ensure that the training coordinators were sufficiently motivated to assist in future training activities. 7 coordinators took part in this pilot projects, and two of them filled in a written questionnaire stating that the training had greatly improved their operational skills. Unfortunately, at that moment the funding of the centers where the training was to have taken place ceased, and the centers were closed. The more large-scale training of adult farmers that we had planned for could not take place. On the positive side, we gained new insights from developing further, and localising, the training material, and moreover we came to appreciate the financial difficulties of conducting such training activities.",
