No differences in clinical disease or mortality were detected comparing Wt and Tg mice up to day 30 p.i. (data not shown). Following infection clinical symptoms were initially apparent in both Tg and Wt mice by day 6 p.i. and peaked at days 10 to 11 p.i. Virus replication was examined to determine whether diminished IFN-\u03b3 signaling in oligodendroglia altered overall CNS virus replication or clearance. Consistent with initial JHMV replication in ependymal cells, astrocytes, and microglia,8 similar levels of infectious virus were detected at days 5 and 7 p.i. (Figure 1) Although infectious virus within the CNS began to decline in both groups by day 10 p.i. (Figure 1), immune-mediated clearance was less efficient in Tg mice. Infectious virus was low, but detectable, in the CNS of \u223c40% of Wt mice at day 14 p.i. and dropped to undetectable levels in all Wt mice by day 16 p.i. By contrast, all infected Tg mice harbored infectious virus in the CNS at day 14 p.i., and infectious virus was detected in five of six Tg mice at day 16 p.i. Although infectious virus was still recovered from 23% of Tg mice at day 21 p.i., complete CNS clearance was achieved at day 30 p.i. (Figure 1). These data suggest that the decreased ability of oligodendroglia to respond to IFN-\u03b3 had a dramatic effect on infectious virus clearance from the CNS, without affecting clinical disease or mortality. The anti-viral Ab response plays no role in controlling acute JHMV infection in Wt mice but is critical in maintaining CNS persistence.11,26\u201328 Anti-viral Ab induction in Tg and Wt mice was compared to ensure that the delay in controlling infectious virus did not correlate with a defect in humoral immunity. No differences in kinetics, magnitude, or isotype of total anti-viral Ab or levels of serum virus neutralizing Ab were detected when comparing Tg and Wt mice (data not shown).",

Consistent with the increased cellularity, bone marrow-derived (CD45hi) CNS-infiltrating cells were maximal at day 10 p.i. (Figure 2) and decreased by day 14 p.i. in both groups (Figure 2). Despite the continued presence of infectious virus in the CNS of Tg mice between days 14 and 21 p.i. (Figure 1), no differences in either yields or percentages of CD45hi cells were detected (Figure 2). In addition, CD45hi inflammatory cells remained within the CNS of both groups until day 30 p.i. (Figure 2), consistent with previous data.9,11,29 Natural killer cells peaked at day 5 p.i. and then declined but remained detectable within the CNS-infiltrating population until day 30 p.i. in both groups (Figure 3). T cells initially represented a small percentage of CNS-infiltrating cells at days 5 and 7 p.i. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells rapidly increased, reaching maximum levels at day 10 p.i. (Figure 3), consistent with a dominant role of CD8+ T cells in clearance of infectious virus.9\u201311 Similar populations of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were retained in the CNS of both Wt and Tg mice (Figure 3). Although an increased percentage of CD4+ T cells in the CNS of infected Tg mice was detected at day 21 p.i., the difference did not reach statistical significance. These data indicate that neither overall inflammatory cell recruitment nor the composition was altered by the inability of oligodendroglia to signal via the IFN-\u03b3R.",

Similar activation and recruitment of the CD8+ T cells from the cervical lymph nodes30 is consistent with previous data demonstrating equivalent peripheral immune responses comparing Tg and Wt mice.23 Within the CNS virus-specific CD8+ T cells comprised \u223c10% of the CD8+ T-cell population at day 5 p.i. and increased to \u223c40% at day 7 p.i. in both the Tg and Wt mice (Figure 4). Virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the CNS increased further to \u223c60% of CD8+ T cells at day 10 p.i. and were retained at relatively constant levels until day 30 p.i. (Figure 4) even as inflammation declined (Figure 2). Furthermore, no differences in either frequency or total numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 were detected (Table 1). In addition, no difference in ex vivo virus-specific CD8+ T cell-mediated cytolysis was detected within the CNS-derived cell populations at 7 and 14 days p.i. (data not shown). Therefore, similar recruitment of virus-specific T cells into the CNS of both Tg and Wt mice suggests that the decreased ability to clear infectious virus was not due to a defect in CD8+ T cell priming, expansion, trafficking, or expression of effector function.",

Viral antigen was initially present in ependymal cells and astrocytes with few infected oligodendroglia in both groups (Figure 5, A and B). Viral antigen increased in these cell types and included a minimal number of infected microglia and macrophages at day 7 p.i., consistent with previous analysis of JHMV infection.8 The number of virus-infected cells decreased in Wt mice by day 10 p.i. (Figure 5C), as infectious virus was cleared (Figure 1). Although an increased number of virus-infected cells was detected in brains of Tg mice at day 10 p.i. (Figure 5D), only few infected cells remained in the brain of either the Tg or Wt mice at days 14 and 16 p.i. (data not shown). Consistent with the descending dissemination of JHMV,8 viral antigen was detected in spinal cords of both groups of mice at day 7 p.i. However, even at this early time point differences in the number and type of virus-infected cells were evident. Virus-infected cells decreased in spinal cord of Wt mice, with only scattered infected oligodendroglia detected by 18 p.i. (Figure 5E). By contrast, the number of infected cells within the white matter of Tg mice remained constant or increased following day 10 p.i. By day 18 p.i. spinal cords of Tg mice contained large numbers of virus-infected cells (Figure 5F). Quantification of virus-infected cells in spinal cords at day 18 p.i. revealed an average of 2.5 \u00b1 2.6 infected cells/mm2 in Wt mice compared to an average of 28.3 \u00b1 11 infected cells/mm2 (P < 0.001) in Tg mice. The morphology and distribution of infected cells along white matter tracks was compatible with oligodendroglia; indeed, oligodendroglia identity was confirmed by co-expression of viral antigen and antigen-presenting cells (Figure 6G). Nevertheless, only scattered infected cells were detected in the spinal cords of either group at day 30 p.i. These data imply that the absence of IFN-\u03b3 signaling delays clearance of virus from oligodendroglia. However, eventual control of infected oligodendroglia suggested that the loss of the infected cells may be due to cell death and/or limited spread via one or more Ab-dependent mechanisms.11,27,28",

Surprisingly, the limited number of apoptotic cells, mainly scattered along white matter tracks, was similar in Wt (Figure 7A) and Tg mice (Figure 7B). Furthermore, the morphology and distribution of apoptotic cells was consistent with infiltrating mononuclear cells rather than glial cells, similar to previous data.12,15 Lastly, the frequency of apoptotic cells confirmed that increased oligodendroglia infection in Tg mice did not result in a concomitant increase in cell death. An average of 11.0 \u00b1 3.5 apoptotic cells/mm2 was found in the spinal cords of Wt mice compared to an average of 14.0 \u00b1 3.9/mm2 in the infected Tg mice. Macrophages within the CNS-infiltrating CD45hi cell populations were quantified to determine whether similar myelin loss was related to diminished recruitment of phagocytes.22 The relative percentage of CNS-infiltrating macrophages was initially high at days 7 and 10 p.i., decreased following virus clearance, and remained relatively stable at low levels until day 30 p.i. in both groups (Figure 7C). In addition, no distinct distribution of F4/80+ cells was detected by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). These data suggest that enhanced infection of oligodendroglia is not associated with either increased glial cell apoptosis or altered macrophage infiltration. JHMV infection of oligodendroglia impaired in IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness does not affect cellular survival and thus does not result in exacerbated demyelination.",

Perforin-mediated cytolysis, but not Fas/Fas-L-dependent signaling, is crucial for control of JHMV replication in astrocytes, macrophages, and microglia.10,15,38 By contrast, perforin-mediated cytolysis does not appear to contribute to JHMV control in oligodendroglia in vivo,10,15 although it has been demonstrated in vitro.39,40 Similar to other CNS-resident cells, oligodendroglia in the na\u00efve CNS do not express major histocompatibility complex molecules. However, major histocompatibility complex class I up-regulation on oligodendroglia during JHMV infection41 supports their potential to act as targets. One hurdle for the inability to demonstrate perforin-mediated oligodendroglial death in vivo may reside in their unknown capacity to present antigen or resist T cell effector function. Analysis of JHMV infection in IFN-\u03b3-deficient mice and immunocompromised recipients of virus-specific IFN-\u03b3-deficient T cells suggested that IFN-\u03b3 controls JHMV replication in oligodendroglia, independent of cytolysis.10,16 Indeed, similar to their participation in the control of other CNS viral infections,2,42 IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells are recruited into the CNS during JHMV infection, and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA peaks coincident with viral clearance.9,13,37,43 Therefore, a novel Tg mouse expressing a dnIFN-\u03b3R1 on oligodendroglia23 was used to directly examine IFN-\u03b3-dependent signaling mechanisms operating at the single-cell-type level within the CNS during JHMV infection.",

JHMV-infected dnIFN-\u03b3R1 Tg mice showed no differences in the number, activation status, or phenotype of CNS-infiltrating cells compared to Wt mice, supporting fully functional peripheral activation of immune effectors in the dnIFN-\u03b3R1 Tg mice23 and contrasting with the increased CD8+ T cells infiltrating the CNS of JHMV-infected IFN-\u03b3-deficient mice.16 Similarly, CD8+ T-cell IFN-\u03b3 secretion and cytolysis were similar in Tg mice compared to Wt mice during acute infection. Consistent with previous data,9,27,44 cytolysis was down-regulated by CNS-retained CD8+ T cells, and the capacity for viral antigen-induced IFN-\u03b3 secretion was retained in both groups of mice. Furthermore, no differences in CNS distribution of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were detected when comparing infected Tg and Wt mice (data not shown). Therefore, the selective decrease in IFN-\u03b3 signaling demonstrates the critical impact of this cytokine on virus clearance from oligodendroglia during acute infection. Despite the delay, ultimate clearance of viral antigen from the oligodendroglia suggests that limited residual IFN-\u03b3 signaling23 may slowly control virus replication. Alternatively, delayed virus clearance coincides with peak anti-viral Ab responses11,26 and suggests that Ab may participate in the eventual control of JHMV replication in oligodendroglia. This concept is consistent with recent data suggesting an increased frequency of infected oligodendroglia in the absence of humoral immunity11,27 and expression of viral proteins on the surface of infected oligodendroglia.45",

It is intriguing that the absence of IFN-\u03b3 signaling leads to increased numbers of infected oligodendroglia without significantly affecting either the extent or distribution of demyelination. Although myelin loss during JHMV infection was initially attributed to direct cytolytic viral infection,20 it has since been associated with CNS inflammatory responses.10,13,21,53 The latter is exemplified by minimal or no demyelination in immunodeficient mice infected with JHMV despite extensive viral infection of oligodendroglia.10,13 A contribution of oligodendroglial infection, dysfunction, and/or death to the process of demyelination in the presence of immune effector functions can nevertheless not be excluded. For example, oligodendroglial apoptosis is implicated in demyelination associated with JC virus infection17 and multiple sclerosis.54 Consistent with these data, Fas is expressed by oligodendroglia within multiple sclerosis lesions34; furthermore, the absence of Fas/FasL interactions and apoptosis are implicated in mediating resistance of lpr-, gld-, and caspase 11-deficient mice to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-induced demyelination.35,55 Although MHV infection induces apoptosis in vitro,56 analysis of Fas/FasL interactions during JHMV infection failed to detect any role in pathogenesis,38 and apoptosis within the CNS appeared to be restricted to the inflammatory cell population.12,15 Similarly, although perforin-mediated cytolysis has been implicated in virus-induced immunopathology,3 the absence of perforin does not affect JHMV-induced demyelination.15 Likewise, in other models of virus-induced demyelination, infection of oligodendroglia does not correlate with the severity of demyelination or apoptosis.19,57 Macrophages are also important components of CNS infiltration during coronavirus infection and are associated with myelin loss.18,21,22 However, the number and distribution of CNS-infiltrating macrophages, as well as other components of the inflammatory response, were similar in JHMV-infected Tg and Wt mice, consistent with similar levels of demyelination. The absence of alterations in inflammatory components despite enhanced numbers of infected oligodendrocytes further suggests that oligodendrocytes tolerate infection by a cytoplasmically replicating RNA virus without overt evidence for release of chemokines or factors that signal destructive effector mechanisms. This notion is consistent with the prominent secretion of chemokines by astrocytes,58 as well as limited matrix metalloproteinase production by resident cells59 in this model. It remains to be investigated whether obvious discrepancies in linking oligodendroglia infection with demyelination during human JC virus infection and the murine JHMV model reside in distinct nature of viruses and their replication strategies or a necessity for IFN-\u03b3 signaling in oligodendrocytes to enhance the demyelinating process.",

Although demyelination following JHMV infection requires infection of oligodendroglia24 and is immune-mediated,10,21,22,53 the results demonstrate a clear absence of correlation between the number of infected cells and the extent of myelin loss. This suggests that infection of this critical CNS cell type, although an indispensable requirement,24,44 does not necessarily directly contribute to myelin loss. Finally, the delayed but complete clearance of virus from oligodendroglia supports a role for humoral control of virus replication in this cell type independent of IFN-\u03b3 signaling mechanisms.",
