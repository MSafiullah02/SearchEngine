The concept of an epidemic, as a disease affecting many persons at the same time and spreading from person to person in a locality where the disease was not previously prevalent, was not enunciated until 1854 when John Snow produced his admirable demonstration of the emergence of an infectious disease in an urban area: the emergence of a cholera epidemic in London. At that time, none could clearly comprehend the mechanisms of emergence and spread since the existence of microbes had just been demonstrated by Louis Pasteur in the late 1830s and microbe transmission modes were more speculative than based on medical or scientific facts, until 1876 when Robert Koch demonstrated that bacteria can be transmitted and responsible for diseases. Nowadays, it is extremely difficult to make a retrospective diagnosis of historical pandemics, There are currently 41 species in the Orthohantavirus genus. The pathogeny of most of them is unknown during times when clinical descriptions were rare or lacking accuracy, and the extent of an epidemic was extremely subjective. Thus, it is common to note that the first outbreak described in the Western World was that of the plague of Athens for which Thucydides rather precisely reported the symptoms; today this epidemic has often been attributed to typhus through its clinical picture and epidemic profile [4] . The first historically recorded outbreaks due to viral agents date to antiquity when the Roman armies were returning from distant countries bringing with them \"exotic\" diseases. Indeed, the rise of a \"new\" virus is an extremely rare event. Most often, in terms of pathogen emergence, a virus adapts through mutation and selection pressure to a human host causing disease. Presumably, smallpox, measles, and influenza were among the plagues that struck the ancient Latins in gusts of epidemics more or less severe. The Antonin plague that extended from 167 to 172 AD in much of Western Europe, when the troops of Emperor Lucius Verus returned from war against the Parthians, is often attributed to a smallpox pandemic by historians. In the Middle Ages, it seems that smallpox made a return around 541 AD to France, Germany, Belgium, and the British Islands [5] . The acute respiratory infections reported during the winter of 876-877 AD accompanying the return of the Carolingian armies from Italy have been attributed by historians to a flu epidemic. Many soldiers of Charlemagne died then. The disease returned regularly and fiercely in 927 and 1105 AD to the western European peninsula [6, 7] (Table 2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1609, "end": 1612, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2471, "end": 2474, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2803, "end": 2806, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2807, "end": 2809, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2810, "end": 2819, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "From the plague (sensu lato, including all transmissible diseases) of antiquity, to the severe acute respiratory syndrome that emerged on the eve of the third millennium, pandemics have followed in the history of mankind. As noted by Mirko Grmek, a historian of medicine, it seems that one pandemic will drive in another. If several diseases circulate concomitantly, one of them will take precedence over the other, an epidemic over the previous, and it is more likely that a pandemic will prevail [8] . Plague temporarily replaced the leprosy that appeared in Eurasia for over 50,000 years; during the first millennium, plague was manifested by successive pandemics that crossed continents. During the first half of the past millennium, syphilis started its expansions, crossed oceans, and became global. Tuberculosis originated in Europe more than 15,000 years ago, but it was only at the turn of the seventeenth century that it was considered a pandemic; smallpox was also manifest as epidemics and then was pandemic at its peak in the late nineteenth century, then smallpox persisted until the Jenner area. Although early medical records of smallpox are available (Egypt, China, India), large and devastating epidemics were only identified in the late fifteenth century of the millennium. Smallpox was introduced into the Americas by Spanish settlers in the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in 1492 and arrived in Mexico in 1509. On Hispaniola Island, one third of a million of the inhabitants died of smallpox in the following 20 years. Smallpox devastated the native Amerindian population and was an important factor in the conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas by the Spaniards [9] . In 1545, 8000 children died in Goa, India, from a smallpox epidemic. In Europe, smallpox was a leading cause of death in the eighteenth century, killing an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year [10] . During the twentieth century, it is estimated that smallpox was responsible for 300-500 million deaths. The last known natural case of smallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977 [11] . It is only at the end of the first millennium that all these pathologies were better understood and their infectious origins elucidated. The first pandemic of the twentieth century was attributed to the H1N1 Spanish Flu that emerged in Kansas in 1918. However, this \"flu pandemic\" is now thought to have had subepidemic circulation earlier in France or Germany or even prior emergence in China in 1916 or 1917 [12] , and to be exascerbated by concurrent bacterial infections. Although it burned out quickly by 1920, it has been estimated that one third of the world's population was afflicted; 50 million people died, half of them in the first 25 weeks of the outbreak.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 498, "end": 501, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1682, "end": 1685, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1882, "end": 1886, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2061, "end": 2065, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2478, "end": 2482, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Historical Perspectives"}, {"text": "Since the 1960s, the frequency and magnitude of dengue fever epidemics increased dramatically as the viruses and the mosquito vectors have both expanded geographically in pandemic proportions [13] largely extending the pandemic to all the intertropical zone.

All these dynamics are essential for an effective disease transmission and spread. An outbreak is a sudden increase in occurrences of a disease in a particular time and place, more localized than an epidemic. An epidemic occurs as the disease spreads to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time. To spark an epidemic chain of transmission depends on factors like immune population density, virus infectiousness, promiscuity, vulnerability, etc., while the efficiency of such transmission depends on how many persons will be infected by one person (i.e., the reproductive ratio or R0). An epidemic event will therefore expand in space (beyond the first cluster of cases) and time (rapid spread). A pandemic is essentially spatial, and represents an epidemic of infectious disease that has spread through human populations across a large region, extensively across two or more continents, to worldwide. However, all these typologies harbor the same fundamentals: emergence from one index case, transmission from one host to another, and spatial expansion. Altogether, an epidemic and a pandemic are respectively a local and a global network of inter connected infectious disease outbreaks (i.e., epidemic chains). Ultimately, understanding how disease (i.e., pathogens) spread in the social system is fundamental in order to prevent and control outbreaks, with broad implications for a functioning health system and its associated costs [15] . Also, after the last case occurs at the end of an epidemic, the goal is to control the risk of transmission for a 21-day time period. This three-week period represents an incubation when the infected subject does not transmit the virus and remains asymptomatic.

Moreover, most viral infectious diseases have a maximal incubation period of 21 days, with few exceptions (e.g., HIV, and rabies). Ultimately, such 21-day periods multiplied by the potential of a carrier to travel will produce the risk area for the emergence of secondary cases (from a walking distance to the long distances covered by commercial jets).

It is extremely helpful when a disease emerges to rapidly surmise the mode of transmission and how to respond (e.g., water-borne disease, arthropod-borne disease, human-tohuman transmission).

Indirect transmission occurs with intermediate hosts such as arthropod vectors (e.g., mosquito, tick) or mammalian vector/reservoir (e.g., rodent, chiropteran) or from infected environmental means (e.g., soil, water, etc.). Mobility and transportation are the main factors for diseases dispersion, as an emblematic example, one can simply show how the 2013-2016 EVD outbreak of Western Africa expanded due to the transportation of patients during their 21-day incubation periods, first by foot-paths, then by motorbike, then taxis and public transportation, finally becoming a global concern with patients traveling by boat or commercial airline [18, 19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1112, "end": 1116, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1120, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "From Focal to Global"}, {"text": "Host population density and promiscuity, crowded places (like schools, markets, mass transportation system) also play an important role in the efficiency of transmission as well as the level of herd immunity (e.g., annual pandemic flu), altogether this gives us the level of population susceptibility (i.e., vulnerability).

The Nipah virus, when it emerged for the first time in Malaysia in 1998, was transported by its natural host, a frugivorous chiropteran. A year earlier, an immense forest fire affecting several Indonesian islands had forced the escape of disease-carrying bats that took refuge in Malaysian orchards, planted to nurture newly developed pig farms. Both pigs and farmers became infected and Nipah virus was discovered for the first time.

Vectortransmitted diseases (i.e., arthropod-borne diseases) depend on the vector ecology (ability to transmit, length of the intrinsic cycle of the virus, trophic preferences, vector density, seasonality, reproduction, breeding sites, food abundance for hematophagous arthropods). Mobility of hosts/vectors that are part of the natural cycle will also play a role in the potential for disease expansion (e.g., mosquito-flying distance, cattle transhumance, human migration). Also, other factors associated with the hosts will render a more efficient transmission: human behaviors like fear/social responses, nosocomial infections, super-spreaders); viruses having multiple natural hosts (vicariates) or vectors; vectors with multiple trophic preferences (e.g., biting cattle, birds, and primates); the incubation period in the vertebrate hosts as well as the intrinsic replication in the arthropod vectors will also intervene; ultimately subclinical infection is also an underestimated factor of virus dispersion and transmission that modifies the epidemiological pattern of disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 302, "end": 306, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Transmission and Spread"}, {"text": "One can distinguish also a typology of communicable diseases that reflects the spatial and temporal mode of transmission including arthropod-borne transmission, human-to-human transmission, human-to-animal (and vice versa) transmitted diseases (i.e., zoo-", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Transmission and Spread"}, {"text": "Predicting HFV Pandemics noses) including vector and nonvector transmitted diseases, and some other types of environmentally transmitted diseases.

VHF are exemplary for their epidemic patterns of expansion dependent on the above reviewed factors (i.e., fundamentals of emergence) and their epidemiological characteristics (i.e., virus, host, environments). For example, let us consider the control of arenavirus spread by their strong host-species association. On a geological time scale, arenaviruses such as the agent for Argentinian hemorrhagic fever (AHF) coevolved with their natural rodent host and then spread according to the expansion of the rodent host. One host-one virus ultimately produces a localized endemic cycle, the distribution of the disease overlaps the distribution of the rodent host while enzootic patterns appear naturally limited to an ecosystem (e.g., local rodent populations, behaviors, and environmental factors). Hantaviruses also appear as a global complex, resulting from the coevolution of virus and rodent hosts and a global dispersion of generally localized enzootic diseases [22] [23] [24] . As for the pandemic risk associated with a natural virus reservoir, chiropterans are unique flying and migratory mammals that have been associated with filoviruses and other viruses of major public health importance [25] , their potential as vectors will eventually favor the spread of these viruses into new territories. Also because there is potential for a long coevolution, epidemiological patterns are also dependent on virus-host spillover, host vicariate, and other environmental factors (e.g., climate change and man-made changes in land use).

The impact of genomic-based biosurveillance in public health and biodefense will not be fully realized until addressing the current impracticality of transferring the terabytes of genomic data generated by DNA sequencing devices to a centralized architecture performing analysis operations, as that might take hours or even days. Therefore, a new paradigm could emerge from encouraging the development of decentralized algorithms that first determine in situ the presence of pathogen-specific genomic signatures or motif fingerprints, summarize and relay the results into an operational biosurveillance metadata format for contextualized decision support.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 75, "end": 79, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 576, "end": 580, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1297, "end": 1301, "text": "[69,", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1305, "text": "70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1881, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2036, "end": 2040, "text": "[72,", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2041, "end": 2044, "text": "73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genomic-Based Biosurveillance"}, {"text": "The localized data management, time, and space required for spatial analysis is performed by geographic information systems (GIS). These are computer systems that manage large volumes of data and easily use the location to perform spatial analysis. Most GIS are not limited to data management functions, but also integrate multiple analysis tools, data transformation, and cartographic representation. These are for the most part complex applications with enormous features. The \"GIS\" designation covers a wide variety of software projects built according to different technical options, functionality, and diverse performances. A GIS is essentially a management tool (structure, organization, entry, storage), an analytical tool (statistical and geographical treatment, spatial analysis), and a communication tool (data visualization, descriptive mapping, thematic mapping, atlas). It is also a tool that allows the use of a spatial model for the simulation of a process, such as the development of an epidemic.

Spatial-temporal modeling of health events can be seen as the final stage of the analysis. It is different from statistical modeling. Despite using risk factors, it considers the epidemic phenomenon as a whole, taking into account the spatial relationships between agents (hosts, vectors, reservoirs, and pathogens), between individuals, and relationships between individuals and their environment. This model is thus useful for understanding and anticipating the epidemics, and can be generally used to classify individuals in different states (susceptible, infected, sick healed, immune) and to model the major phenomena that can change the state of an individual.

Certainly, we are not \"globally\" prepared, unfortunately, at that scale, the immense natural and human disparities do not permit it, but we do our best in our own societies. The concept of disease emergence, born only at the end of the twentieth century, is a societal marker, our desire to be on alert, understand and predict epidemics. Ultimately, there are a few, but necessary and difficult goals to reach for the prevention and control of any epidemic, also these goals are part of the development of our societies, as well as for education, they become part of the wellbeing for all: First, beyond understanding transmission, is needed a clear understanding of the epidemiological pattern and the spread of a given disease, before it is too late; then, which is certainly one of the more complex and costly things to achieve, is having an efficient health system to respond to an epidemic and an operational network to respond at the regional and global levels; and last but certainly not a least, having identified funding for any public health emergency will be crucial to changing our world. Perhaps, in a shrinking global community, after too many Ebola virus disease outbreaks, we will learn and be prepared for future epidemic challenges?
