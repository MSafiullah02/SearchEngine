In the corresponding constructs T2nr9, T1jil, T1qgt, and T2ic8, the portion in italics (underlined) is replaced by the corresponding linker sequences indicated in Figure 2\n. A modified pPEP-T vector that coded for the monomer of the core particle was double digested with restriction enzymes ApaI (New England Biolabs \u2014 NEB) and XhoI (NEB) and then the linker oligonucleotides were ligated using T4 DNA ligase (NEB). Plasmids harboring the desired genes were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli expression cells (Novagen). Bacterial growth was carried out at 37 \u00b0C in Luria Broth (LB) medium in the presence of ampicillin (200 \u03bcg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 \u03bcg/ml). Expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 3 hours of expression, cells were harvested and centrifuged at 4000g for 10 min and frozen at \u2212 80 \u00b0C. Purification was done under denaturing conditions (9 M urea). The cell pellet was thawed on ice, resuspended in lysis buffer A at pH 8.0 (9 M urea, 100 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris and 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by sonication (SONICATOR\u00ae3000 Ultrasonic Liquid Processor, cycle of 4 s pulse at 55% amplitude followed by a 6 s rest repeated for a 10 min period). The cell membranes were removed by centrifugation (45 min at 30500g). The supernatant was then incubated with nickel-NTA beads (Qiagen) for one hour so that the protein could be purified by affinity chromatography. Possible DNA contamination was removed by a wash with buffer B at pH 8.0 (9 M urea, 500 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris, 10 mM imidazole). Protein contaminants were washed from the column using a pH gradient and 10 mM imidazole in the buffers. The first wash was done with lysis buffer A and the second and third washes were done at pH 6.3 and pH 5.9, respectively, with a buffer containing 9 M urea, 100 mM NaH2PO4, 20 mM sodium citrate, 10 mM imidazole and 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Elution was achieved at pH 5.2 and pH 4.5 with 9 M urea, 100 mM NaH2PO4, 20 mM sodium citrate, 10 mM imidazole and 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Protein purity was verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following purification, the denatured monomeric polypeptides were refolded using one of the following three methods: (1) dialysis performed in a stepwise manner until 0 M urea was reached (stepwise refolding) (2) dialysis against a buffer with no urea (direct refolding) or (3) concentration (Amicon ultracentrifugal filter devices) and dilution to a buffer with no urea (quick refolding). The proteins were filtered with a 0.1 \u03bcm polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filter before and after dialysis (Milipore #SLVV 033 RS).",

Afterwards, a 5 \u03bcl sample aliquot was adsorbed for 1 min to a glow discharged STEM film (thin carbon film that spans a thick fenestrated carbon layer covering 200-mesh/inch, gold-plated copper grids). The grid was then blotted, washed on 8 drops of quartz double-distilled water, blotting between each step, and plunge frozen in liquid nitrogen.

The average background scattering of the carbon support film was then subtracted and the mass calculated. The results were scaled according to the mass-per-length measured for TMV, corrected for beam-induced mass-loss,34 binned into histograms and described by Gaussian curves.

In the original PDB structure (human hepatitis B virus capsid) this residue is reduced and does not form a disulfide bond that might stabilize protein structure.20 Likewise for our construct (T1qgt-8-pf) we wanted to prevent the occurrence of disulfide bridges so as to mimic the cysteine\u2019s oxidation state in the original PDB structure. Another advantage of a reduced cysteine for our SAPN, is that aggregation caused by intermolecular disulfide bridges would be prevented. Given this knowledge, we included the reducing agent TCEP in the refolding buffer. The buffer used for stepwise removal of urea was 20 mM Tris pH 8.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 0.1 mM TCEP (reducing agent). High pH and low NaCl concentration were selected because of our research group\u2019s successful refolding of constructs containing pan-DR epitope under these conditions.11, 12 Despite the fact that refolding was performed under reducing conditions there was substantial aggregation caused by unknown interactions (Figure 3\n, A). To corroborate self-assembly of the protein in another way, we used dynamic light scattering (DLS), which is a biophysical technique that measures the size and size distribution of molecules in solution. The DLS graph (Figure 3, B) confirms the results obtained by TEM depicting heterogeneity and aggregation.",

As with stepwise refolding the salt concentration (50 mM NaCl) and glycerol volume (5%) remained unchanged. What was varied was the buffering agent and the pH: Mes (pH 6.5) and Hepes (pH 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0). Aggregation tendencies were found at all pH values except pH 7.0 (Figure 5\n). The electron micrograph (Figure 5, A) shows that the polypeptide chains self-assembled into nanoparticles with fairly homogeneous, spherical shapes with diameters ranging from 32 nm to 36 nm. The solution data observed with dynamic light scattering (Figure 5, B) correlate with the TEM data. Clearly neutral pH seemed to work best for the refolding of T2i88-8-pf.",

According to M\u00fcller and Engel,35 the importance of the STEM for mass determination lies in its ability to analyze intact biological structures regardless of their shape and at the same time to provide an image from which the quality and homogeneity of the specimen may be independently assessed. The mass of T2i88-8-pf was determined by analyzing 389 nanoparticles from the dark-field STEM images (Figure 7\n). The masses range from 1.2 to 13.8 MDa. Together they form a histogram that tails off to higher mass and can be described by 5 Gaussians. The major peak is at 2.9 \u00b1 0.4 MDa, which it is compatible with the presence of about 180 peptide chains per particle. Examination of the corresponding images shows that the higher masses frequently arise from clusters of nanoparticles, documenting the type of aggregation that occurs (Figure 7, inset), while particles with masses below about 4.0 MDa have essentially circular projections compatible with a roughly spherical shape.",

Aili et al. demonstrated that helix\u2013loop\u2013helix polypeptides containing cysteine in the loop region can form four-arm dendrimers by forming a disulfide bridge.38 These dendrimers would be the units that assemble to form fibers. The construct studied here could also be viewed as a helix\u2013loop\u2013helix polypeptide able to form fibers in the same way. However, in our case the situation is more complex as the helices interact with one another as pentamers and trimers, which would then create sheets of aggregation or other structures that are hard to predict. The fibers formed by these would not be similar to those described by Aili et al. Strings of nanoparticles with a length of 200 nm can be observed in the TEM micrographs (Figure 3, A). DLS also shows a peak around 200 nm (Figure 3, B). This is of interest because studies have shown that protein nanofibers can act as self-adjuvanting vaccines in mice39, 40\n",

The flexibility in the linker region allows different inter-helical angles, which influences the self-assembly of the nanoparticles. Considering the potential application of nanoparticles as vaccines, the different angles would allow different epitope densities, which may result in distinct immune responses.
