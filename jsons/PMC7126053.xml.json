Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium vivax, and Plasmodium knowlesi are responsible for the spread of malaria, out of which P. falciparum is considered as the most virulent form [1]. According to World Health Organization (WHO) factsheet 2013, out of 3.4 billion people at malarial risk, 1.2 billion are at high risk with more than one case per 1000 people, especially in tropical areas with transmission over 97 countries [2]. In 2012, more than 207 million cases were reported globally with an estimated 6,27,000 deaths; 90% of them occurred in sub-Saharan Africa in which 77% were children under the age of five [3]. Since 2006, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been recommended for the treatment of malaria, however, the development of resistance in the recent times to ACT in many parts of Southeast Asian regions is of great concern [4], [5].",

Recently, Chibale and co-workers have disclosed the synthesis and antimalarial activity of a series of thiolactone\u2013isatin conjugates and their tetracyclic by-products [18]. One of the most potent conjugate displayed an IC50 value of 6.92 \u03bcM against chloroquine resistant (CQ-R) W2 strain of P. falciparum. Further, Raval et al. described the synthesis of tetrahydropyrimidine\u2013isatin hybrids and their in vitro activity against 3D7 strain of P. falciparum\n[19]. The most potent hybrid exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.035 \u03bcg/mL which was better than the standard CQ (MIC = 0.125 \u03bcg/mL).",

The preparation of stable metal complexes with predictable structures, ability to tune ligand affinities along with efficient biological targeting are the major advantages associated with the synthesis of organometallics (c), [21], (a), (b). Among all the metals used, ferrocene (Fc) has played a distinctive role in the contemporary medicine because of its unique features including non-toxicity and stability under physiological conditions [22]. The replacement of the organic functionality with Fc has now been recognized as a useful strategy for the development of new and effective drugs viz. anti-androgen nilutamide and ferrocenyl analogs of commercial anti-estrogen tamoxifen displayed higher cytotoxicity against breast and prostate cancer cells respectively in comparison to the reference drugs (c), [23], (a), (b). Indeed, the most symbolic example of contribution of ferrocene with enhanced biological activity into a drug molecule is that of Ferroquine (FQ); derived from chloroquine (CQ) with ferrocene appended side chain which is 22 times more active than CQ against CQ-R strain of P. falciparum\n(a), (b), [24].",

The synthetic precursor viz. N-alkylbromo-isatins were previously evaluated for their antimalarial potential against chloroquine-resistant W2 strains of P. falciparum and have displayed IC50 values >20 \u03bcM [18]. As evident from Table 1, the synthesized conjugates were not as active as standard drug chloroquine (CQ) but displayed considerable activity against both the strains. The conjugates 5a\u2013d with an ethyl chain introduced as linker failed to inhibit the growth of 3D7 even at the highest concentration tested; exception being 5a (R = H) displaying an IC50 value of 24.43 \u03bcM. Increasing the chain length from ethyl to propyl seemed to have considerable influence on the activity profiles as the conjugates 5e\u2013h displayed IC50s in the range 3.76\u201316.20 \u03bcM. The most potent conjugate 5f with a fluoro substituent at C-5 position and a propyl linker displayed an IC50 value of 3.76 \u03bcM against 3D7 strain. Similar comparison of structure activity relationship of the synthesized conjugates against W2 strain revealed the ethyl linked conjugates (5a\u2013d) to be inactive even at highest tested concentration. The replacement of the ethyl chain with propyl chain again improved the activity profiles with little influence of the nature of substituent introduced at C-5 position of the isatin ring. The conjugate 5n with electron withdrawing Cl-substituent at C-5 position and n = 3 proved to be the most potent with an IC50 of 4.58 \u03bcM.",
