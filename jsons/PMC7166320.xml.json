Sledz et al. have reported that transfection of two siRNA induced cellular interferon responses,\n37\n while Bridge et al. report that shRNA\u2010expressing plasmids induced an interferon response but transfection of synthetic siRNA did not.\n31\n Speculatively, these effects on the interferon system might be construct dependent. Our shRNA\u2010expression plasmids and adenoviruses did not activate ISG responses in vitro (Fig. 5a,b) or in vivo (Fig. 7b). We have preliminarily detected phosphorylated PKR (P\u2010PKR) by western blotting, and found no apparent increase of P\u2010PKR (data not shown). These results indicate that these target sequences and structures are of sufficient specificity to silence the target gene without eliciting non\u2010specific interferon responses.",

The AxshRNA\u2010HCV specifically blocked expression of HCV structural proteins in a conditional transgenic mouse expressing those proteins. The current adenovirus vectors may cause inflammatory reactions in the target organ,\n45\n however, and produce neutralizing antibodies which make repeated administration difficult.
