Global traffic is estimated to be over one billion passengers annually [1]. The flying public demands a comfortable and safe cabin environment because they may encounter a combination of environmental factors including low humidity, low air pressure, and sometimes, exposure to air contaminants such as ozone, carbon monoxide, various organic compounds [2]. It has been reported that international air travel could have the potential risks associated with airborne disease transmission [3], [4] and about 2.5% overseas travelers requested medical attentions for all sorts of health related problems during the flights [5]. Olsen et al. [6] have reported that 22 passengers among the 120 passengers on a flight from Hong Kong to Beijing were infected with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Therefore, it is essential to examine the cabin environment to ensure that it is safe, healthy, and comfortable for the flying public.",

The facts mentioned above leave an element of doubt whether the air distributions in airliner cabins are acceptable, in other words, the air distributions in airliner cabins may have the problem of providing comfortable and safe cabin environment. Furthermore, the air distributions in airliner cabins may be of unsteady state, low speed, high turbulence without knowing pulse frequency. Therefore, it is essential to study how the air is distributed in the air cabins and to characterize how the airflow transports pollutants.",

Nevertheless, such information tends to be sparse in the public literature. One possible reason is that aircraft manufacturers\u2019 are unwilling to share publicly the proprietary details of their designs. Since the comfort and safety of aircraft cabins are a matter of public interest and discussion, the related research by non-aircraft manufacturers has substantially increased during the last decade. The objective of this study is to provide an open database from carefully designed experiments for all researchers concerned working on cabin environment issues. To identify the state-of-the-art methods forms the basis of the investigation reported in this paper.",

Experimental studies are usually thought to be more reliable but they are often very expensive and time consuming, so measurements are mainly used to provide data for validating numerical simulations [7], [8]. Moreover, as some characteristics of the airflow in aircraft cabins are unknown, it is hard to identify a proper instrument or measuring method to study it. A validated numerical tool can then be used to analyze many scenarios for achieving the best design at a low cost. As most numerical models apply to a particular fluid feature, a model suitable for studying air distributions in aircraft cabins has not been found. This paper will discuss the two methods used in recent studies of air distributions in aircraft cabins.",

A higher air velocity can cool down a heated sensor so the air velocity can be determined from the sensor temperature. The hotwire and hot-sphere anemometers are respectively shown in Fig. 1\n. As its name implies, a hotwire anemometer measures the velocity with a heated wire which is sensitive to the velocity direction. Thus, some hotwire anemometers can also measure airflow directions. However, a hot-sphere anemometer measures the omni-directional velocity magnitude, not the direction. Normally, the measuring range is 0.2 \u223c 20 m/s for a hotwire anemometer and 0.05 \u223c 5 m/s for a hot-sphere anemometer; the related accuracies are \u00b11% \u223c \u00b13% and \u00b11% \u223c \u00b15%, respectively. These two types of anemometers are point sensors.",

They used hotwire anemometers to measure the velocity distributions without flow directions. Zhang et al. [10] used hot-sphere anemometers to obtain the boundary conditions from the diffusers in a full-scale, twin-aisle section of an aircraft cabin mockup. As the size of the diffuser was small and the inlet air velocity was relatively high, it was very difficult to obtain accurate flow information. Since the hot-sphere anemometers did not measure the flow direction, they estimated the flow direction by using smoke visualization, which could not provide highly accurate results. Recently, we applied the hot-sphere anemometers to measure the velocity magnitude on the diffusers of an MD-82 aircraft and found that the velocities varied greatly along the diffusers (Fig. 2\n).",

This method can identify if a flow is two-dimensional or three-dimensional [14]. Singh et al. [15] used both smoke visualization and PSV to study the airflow pattern inside an aircraft cabin, with heated cylinders that were used to approximate the heat released by passengers. They found that the PSV was not sufficiently accurate for a precise understanding of the flow field. By employing the helium bubbles technique with Volumetric Particle Streak Velocimetry (VPSV), Sun et al. [16] and Zhang et al. [17] measured the airflow in a cabin mockup with manikins. They found that obstructions significantly affected the velocity field at the passenger breathing level. The large volume of airspace and the obstruction from the manikins also prevented them from acquiring detailed airflow data. The insufficient spatial resolution and the lack of velocity data near the boundaries prevented them from gaining a deeper understanding of the flow dynamics.",

Tracking the movement of the individual tracer particles in the air yields better results for low-speed flows. M\u00fcller et al. [19] used helium-filled bubbles as seeding particles for a PTV to investigate the isothermal flow in a full-scale Airbus A330-A340 cabin mockup with seats. Their study focused on the overhead region above the passenger seats in an effort to optimize the air outlet geometry. This effort opened the door to quantitative measurements of large volume, low-speed flows, which were difficult to measure by other flow measurement techniques. Wang et al. [20] and Yan et al. [21] used an extended VPTV system to measure the airflow in a cabin with heated manikins, but only the upper part of the cabin was measured because it was difficult to light in the lower part of the cabin due to the light being obstructed by the seats and manikins. Compared with a PIV, the VPTV has a larger imaging window because of the sparsely seeded flow, has better positional accuracy, and is more applicable for large volume measurements. There is also three-dimensional PTV consisting of three or four digital cameras.",

            "text": "PIV systems are the most popular and versatile optical anemometry for measuring velocity and related properties in fluids. As PIV determines velocity through the movement of a group of particles seeded into the flow, it can be regarded as a high particle concentration mode of PSV. PIV can provide high spatial resolution of the velocity data and can measure instantaneous flow fields [22]. During the measurements, it is necessary to clear the optical paths needed for the PIV system. Thus, the geometry that can be measured is often restricted. For example, Mo et al. [8] performed airflow measurements in a cabin and lowered all the seat backs except those next to the windows so that the laser beam could penetrate the space. This made the cabin being studied much different from reality, although velocimetry could accurately measure the air distributions. Bosbach et al. [23], G\u00fcnther et al. [24] and Lin et al. [25] also used a PIV system to measure the airflow in an empty cabin mockup, which was quite different from the practical in-flight situation. Zhang et al. [17] and K\u00fchn et al. [26] applied a PIV system to measure the airflow patterns in a cabin in occupied situations, but the PIV measurement could only reach the upper part of the cabin as the seats and manikins significantly blocked the light for showing the airflow paths. Their measurements encountered the same problem as Mo et al. did. However, the study did demonstrate that the configuration of the air supply inlets and rising thermal plumes from the passengers had a large impact on the flow field inside an aircraft cabin.",

The movement of the body inside the water tank was similar to a passenger walking in an airliner cabin and transporting contaminants in his/her wake.

It is hard to accurately measure the flow conditions near air supply diffusers in a cabin. In addition, a full-scale air cabin mockup could easily cost a million dollars or more and may or may not represent real cabin conditions if the simulator contains only a few rows of seats [10]. Furthermore, in-flight airflow studies using full-scale laboratory mockups are expensive and time consuming. Varying cabin conditions such as different occupancy distributions, passenger capacities, and movements of crew and passengers [36], [37] would make laboratory measurements more complicated.

            "text": "A zonal model can create a multi-dimensional flow network in a flow domain. By dividing an enclosed space into sub-zones, the zonal model solves the conservation equations of mass, energy, and contaminants and calculates the flow rate between sub-zones by simple correlations for flow and pressure [39] or for flow and temperature [40]. A zonal model requires prior knowledge of the flow pattern. The division of a domain has strong influence over the modeling result. Since an experienced user can obtain accurate results [41], the zonal model has a considerable number of applications. Olander and Westlin [42] used a zonal model to calculate airflow and contaminant concentration in an aircraft cabin. The box model is quite similar to the zonal model since it is assumed to be completely mixed in each box. The zonal or box model could give a rough estimate of the air distribution since it calculates only the macroscopic flow between zones. Ko et al. [43] used a sequential box model to estimate the concentration of tuberculosis in each box zone. Both the box and zonal models are, in principle, lumped methods. Their objective was to model the airflow as a simplified flow network; the governing equations are linear. However, the use of a zonal model is not as easy as one may think, especially if one has to handle special cells. By comparing zonal models with very coarse-grid CFD simulations, the zonal models do not show much superiority in reducing computing time. In many cases, the overhead time in preparing the data input for a zonal model may be longer than that for a CFD simulation.",

Depending on how many transport equations are used to solve the eddy viscosity, RANS eddy viscosity models are further categorized as zero, one, two, three, and four equation models. The most well-known and applied models for air distributions in a cabin are the two-equation standard k-\u025b [53] and RNG k-\u025b [54] models. Reynolds stress models need to solve six extra transport equations and the solution procedure may not be stable, which makes them less popular [55].",

When they were used in an airliner cabin with passengers and seats, the laser light sheet was blocked so it could not be used in the area.
