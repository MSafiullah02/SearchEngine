All articles basically concluded the same that chest CT in COVID-19 patients shows findings common in viral pneumonias and that it is not possible to discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia from other viral pneumonias. 3 It is also worth noting that the same pulmonary CT scan findings were reported in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 4 ; 3. study on certain antiviral agent efficacy in COVID-19 patients, designed, conducted and written by the sponsor, without control group and without clearly stating how the patients were selected among those who fulfilled the inclusion criteria 5 4. development of various prediction models for COVID-19 that mostly confirm and reinvent already well-known predictors of poor outcome in patients with respiratory failure. A large review concluded that all of those articles are of low quality, poorly reported and highly biased. 6 When this pandemic subsides, we could use this situation as a motive to reduce redundancy in publication, to modernize the way data are presented and to avoid the same issues when the new pandemic arrives.",
