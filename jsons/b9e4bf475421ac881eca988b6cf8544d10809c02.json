Lockdowns, though an effective policy for containment, imposes a heavy cost on the economy as it enforces extreme social distancing measures on the whole population. The objective of this note is to study alternatives to Lockdown which are either more targeted or allows partial opening of the economy. Cities are often spatially organized into wards. We introduce Multi-lattice small world (MLSW) network as a model of a city where each ward is represented by a 2D lattice and each vertex in the latex represents an agent endowed with SEIR dynamics. Through simulation studies on MLSW we examine a variety of candidate suppression policies and find that restricting Lockdowns to infected wards can indeed out-perform global Lockdowns in both reducing the attack rate and also shortening the duration of the epidemic. Even policies such as partial opening of the economy, such as Two Day Work Week, can be competitive if augmented with extensive Contact Tracing.",

As of 19th April more than 2 million people have been infected globally and has resulted in more than 100 thousand deaths. The Director of WHO recently warned that The worst is yet to come (Press). Several countries have suffered massive loss of human lives, there are far greater number of countries where COVID19 has just arrived. The anticipated cumulative loss of lives in these countries could be apocalyptic and require urgent measures.

Lockdown was first used in China for fighting the COVID19 pandemic. The effectiveness of such Lockdowns is still being evaluated [6] , but there is now global consensus that it is probably the best tool for containment. Despite the success of Lockdown there are however growing concerns that Lockdown may have unintended consequences which could be devastating to the economy (Press). Unemployment is an inevitable outcome of economic downturn and it is no surprise that Lockdowns have resulted in significant job losses. For instance, in France half of private sector employees have been unemployed because of Coronavirus related Lockdown (Press). There is thus an urgent need for seeking effective alternatives to Lockdowns.",

Restricting the imposition of a Lockdown to infected wards seems to be the best suppression strategy and can be more efficient than Lockdowns. (2) Opening up the economy, like a 2 Day work-week, can be competitive with global lockdowns if there is extensive contact tracing. (3) Contact Tracing involves checking the state of the persons in the contact network of the suspect and then isolating them if neccessary. Our empirical results suggest that this mayn't be as effective as Tracing the Contacts and their Contacts(TC2S). The suggested TC2Sstrategy can substantially lower the attack rate, by more than 30%, over the prevalent Contact Tracing approach. (4) Apart from the study we also contribute MLSW, a flexible mathematical model, which can be used for studying policy interventions in a city. The relevant software would be made available soon.",

Compared to traditional compartmental models [13] these models incorporate contact structure and are thus considered as more realistic for explaining epidemics. Empirical modeling of COVID19 outbreak suggests that Network based models such as Small world networks can be a better candidate to explain the spread of the disease [23] . Small world networks [22] was first introduced in epidemiology by [1] for understanding epidemic spread on networks. Since then there has been substantial interest in using Small World Networks in modeling specialized disease outbreaks [15, 16, 20] . To the best of our knowledge no study has attempted to understand the spread of COVID19 on small world networks. Previously studies of epidemic modeling on Small World Networks have used SEIR, as a compartmental model, on 1D and 2D lattice based models [4] .",

Small world networks posit a 1D or 2D lattice structure on the entire population with occasional long edges. Such networks will miss the point that the cities are not necessarily homogeneously structured but are often organized into spatial clusters, for example the city of London has 25 wards. The motivation for modeling the ward structure arises from the need for containment of disease at the ward level. Directing measures to target affected individuals should have the most effect in containment but unfortunately there mayn't be enough technological support for executing such measures. Imposing a coarse measure such as Lockdown on an entire city is unsustainable as it would face compliance issues from the broader population. Ward level interventions may strike the right compromise in deriving sustainable containment policies. It is also to be noted that ward wise containment policies are already being considered in several Indian cities including Bengaluru (Press). Our aim is to compare such strategies to Lockdown.",

This parameter modulates the transmission parameter to obtain an effective transmission rate of \u03b2 = \u03b7\u03b2 0 , The value of \u03b7 = 0 corresponds to perfect lockdown and \u03b7 = 1 represents the other extreme with no lockdown. Perfect lockdown corresponds to the entire population being quarantined. As practiced in many places LD is enforced by shutting down all but essential services. This should definitely lower \u03b2 M considerably and getting such estimates would be difficult. One can assume that Lockdown will correspond to a small \u03b7. A small \u03b7 corresponds to lowering of the reproduction rate in the network. (We hesitate to use R 0 here because reproduction rate has meaning at any instant of time in a network.) In the absence of clear guidelines, in this note we will define LD as any measure which can achieve \u03b7 \u2264 0.5. It would be useful to know how long should such a lockdown need to continue.",

Contact Tracing usually involves checking for infections in all persons who have come in the contact of an infected person. Based on empirical results (see Figure 4) we propose a two level strategy-not only trace the contacted persons of the patient, but also trace their contacts as well. We call this policy Tracing the Contacts and their Contacts (TC2S) and implement it as follows. The trigger is when a node u becomes severe (IS) or critical (IC). In this case, we look at all its neighbours v and seal it if it is state I M. We then look at the neighbours of v and then seal all their neighbours who is in state I M.as well. Finding the neighbours of u and their neighbours are part of the tracing mechanism. Sealing means the node will not have any connections with its neighbours and it could be implemented by either self-isolation or being admitted to Quarantine facilities. Here is a reason for doing this two level tracing. The node u must have got infected by one of its neighbours u p (who may have recovered since), who could have infected other neighbours as well. We cannot reach these neighbours by merely sealing the neighbours of u. Hence the two level tracing and sealing.",

Red indicates unacceptable, Green indicates acceptable and Yellow indicates can be considered. We assume that a city's Healthcare system can deal with patients comfortably if the percentage of infected population is less than 5%(I \u221e is less than 5%). In case of epidemic outbreaks it can be pushed to higher values for a short amount of time say 15%. To assess the suitability of the duration of the policy, T epi , one could compare it with T epi for LD. From our simulations it seems that a strict Lockdown may take around 4 months(median value) to make the population Infection free. We rounded all T epi estimates to nearest months, and decide that all values less than 4 months are acceptable, as it is more efficient than LD. If T epi is more than double the duration during Lockdown, i.e. more than 8 months, we can consider it as unacceptable. Values in between can be deemedas can be considered. To assess the suitability of T e we assume that only a small fraction of the population can be contact traced and isolated. We set this limit to less than 0.5%. Any number more than 1% would be unacceptable. For W l one can argue that a policy should not be as expensive as LD. Any acceptable value must be necessarily less than 1. As lockdowns are expensive, one can argue that any policy should incur a loss which is a small fraction of the loss incurred by LD. We set the threshold for W l to be 0.1 for being acceptable. Any value between 0.1 and 1 can be considered. A value more than 1 is not acceptable. These thresholds are only notionally set to enable comparison. They can be set more precisely by using information from Health Departments from respective cities.",

The graphs show how fast an epidemic can sweep through the different wards of the city by simply tuning the rewiring parameter, p 0 . The effect of relaxation factor, \u03b7: The aim of most Intervention strategies is to reduce the \u03b2's so that the effective transmission comes down. The relaxation factor, \u03b7, takes values between 1 and 0 and serves to reduce the transmission parameters (\u03b7\u03b2 M , \u03b7\u03b2 S , \u03b7\u03b2 C ). This allows to model various Interventions designed to hinder the transmission by a single parameter \u03b7. Figure 6 shows plots of the number of infected persons with time for various values of \u03b7. As \u03b7 decreases the speed of progression becomes slower and the disease takes longer time and the peak infection also comes down. However, it effects most of the population, almost the same death and recovery rates. As reported elsewhere (for e.g. [5] ), such reductions in transmission rates could be obtained by various social distancing measures. These interventions ensures that the peak infection rate comes down but overall a large fraction of population gets infected. These kind of measures help in flattening the curve and does not help in Suppression. The results show that the strategies of suppression belong to the regime of \u03b7 < 0.5. In this regime both R \u221e is extremely low and length of the epidemic is reduced to below the base case. The figure in the right hand side of Figure 6 shows that the longevity of the epidemic reduces as \u03b7 decreases. Thus suppression strategies should aim for Interventions which can halve the transmission rate. Such strategies would be difficult to achieve without extreme social distancing, such as Lockdowns.",

(2) The study confirms that Lockdown(LD) is an acceptable strategy with and without contact tracing as it reduced the attack rate to 0.52% compared to 85% with no interventions. When used with TC2S it further improves to 0.35%. (3) Lockdowns of limited duration or relaxed Lockdowns are not acceptable even in the early stages. However, Lockdowns of limited duration is extremely useful to bring down the infections temporarily. (4) Releasing the lockdown for a few days in a week(TDWW) can be considered but it can be risky. Contact Tracing should be a must for such policies. (5) TC2S when used as a stand-alone strategy may not be effective but when used with some of the other alternatives it can generate much improved policies. Mild lockdowns, which on its own is not acceptable, but when coupled with TC2S produces an acceptable policy. Another intervention, shortened week with lockdown (TDWW+LD) is risky but when applied with TC2S becomes very effective. When used with TC2S it reduces the attack rate by 1/3 that of Lockdown. The effectiveness of TC2S, as proposed here, would depend on not only identifying the complete list of infected people in the contact network but also would require identifying any infected people in the network of the contacts. These findings are similar to [9, 11] where it is argued that extensive contact tracing and case isolation may help (6) WSO(0,3) appears to be the most promising alternative to LD. It not only outperforms LD on attack rate but also reduces the duration of the epidemic by 1/2 when augmented with contact tracing. Even mild lockdowns with contact tracing in WSO can be an acceptable alternative. 12 .

While Contact tracing is not necessary it will definitely help in improving the WSO policy outcomes. An interesting insight is since we can target the tracing to the ward it even requires less number of contacts to be traced then implementing LD. If there is substantial shortage of Testing kits making WSO unviable then one can consider the alternative policy of opening the economy for Two days a week. If the two policies are weighed in terms of their economics then one can say that WSO though opens the economy much more than the 2 day week policy but also requires some investment in Testing, which could be a challenge in densely populated urban wards of metropolises. But for both the interventions require Contact Tracing. 13 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

This type of small world model does not seem to have been investigated before and a detailed mathematical study of the properties should be an important area of investigation. Our results indicate three interesting highlights. Firstly, Tracing the Contacts and their Contacts shows substantial benefits over the usual practice of Tracing the Contacts. Secondly, opening the economy partially, say 2 days a week followed by a Lockdown, could be more effective than Lockdown. Thirdly, and most importantly, the most preferred strategy should be to do hotpot surveillance. It is argued that not only it has lower attack rates, it also is much faster in destroying the virus. On top of these two things it is also economically far more efficient. If this is introduced early enough it is possible that 14 .",

A day in the Simulation consist of two steps, namely Edge Sweep and Node Sweep. Edge Sweep: All the edges in MLSW are inspected in an arbitrary order. If edge (u, v) has one of its endpoints (say v) as susceptible S, and the other endpoint (u) as infected (there are three possibilities here: I M, IS, IC). Then the infection will spread to v with a probability that depends on the nature of the infection at u. Let \u03b2 = [\u03b2 M , \u03b2 S , \u03b2 C ] \u22a4 be a vector of parameters where \u03b2 M , \u03b2 S , \u03b2 C are probabilities of infecting a node with vertex S corresponding to states I M, IS, IC respectively. If the infection should spread, the new state of the node v would be exposure E. Vertex Sweep: All nodes of MLSW are inspected in arbitrary order. Each node u is in one of seven states. Unless the states are in R or D where nothing happens as these are final states, in all other case the node transitions to a new state or stays put according to the probabilities assigned in 2. This mimics the progression of the disease in an individual. The simulation runs through several days till there are no infected patients in the network, i.e. all states are in any one of R, S, D states.",
