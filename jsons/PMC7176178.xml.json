How our species survives in the hostile world that surrounds us has been a source of fascination since the beginning of recorded time. Injury and infection likely exacted a heavy toll as our early hominid ancestors descended from the trees and adapted a predatory life style on the African plains; death from bleeding and wound infections undoubtedly plagued early humans (Opal 2003). Epidemic disease, however, probably played a minor role in shaping the primitive human immune system. Instead, the primary determinants of lethality for small, scattered bands of hunter-gatherer populations of Homo sapiens were starvation, predation, and hypothermia.",

Since that time, waves of epidemics have been recorded and continue unabated today.

Large population densities of humans in fixed, farming communities provided the essential substrate for efficient airborne transmission of respiratory pathogens and for a sufficient number of partner exchanges to maintain sexually transmitted diseases as well (Sherman 2007). With the acceptance of the germ theory of disease, novel modalities succeeded in protecting human populations primarily through enhanced sanitation measures, public health efforts, and, as vaccine science evolved, through the use of vaccination. The fundamental historical events that gave rise to the fields of microbiology, immunology, and infectious diseases will be described in this chapter (Fig. 3.1).\n",

Blankets were deliberately contaminated with the scabs from smallpox victims and left for the Indians in wintertime. Whether acquired from the fomites or via human-to-human transmission, smallpox devastated the Indians who had sided with the French forces, contributing to the British victory (Diamond 1999).",

Shortly after Columbus\u2019 first return voyage in 1493, an epidemic of \u201cgreat pox\u201d occurred throughout much of Europe. \u201cGreat pox\u201d aptly described the clinical appearance of the cutaneous lesions of secondary syphilis, in contradistinction to the familiar appearance of smallpox. While it is possible, even likely, that some of Columbus\u2019 crew contributed to the spread of syphilis throughout Europe, they were likely the vector, rather than the original source of infection. Skeletal remains found in both Britain and Greece and dated well before Columbus made his famous voyage carry the unmistakable stigmata of the osseous forms of tertiary syphilis. It is likely that syphilis existed in Europe prior to Columbus in relatively rare and localized forms, arriving from the Mediterranean via trade routes established centuries earlier. After the defeat of the Islamic Moors in the Battle of Granada in 1492, a Papal order closed all leprosaria, institutions that probably housed numerous, misdiagnosed, syphilitic patients within their confines. Release of these highly infectious individuals, coupled with the rampant prostitution practices of the time, likely contributed to the spread of the disease across Europe. This newly recognized and highly virulent form of syphilis continued to be epidemic into the first half of the sixteenth century (Sherman 2007).",

Fracastorius correctly surmised that tiny, free-living organisms, which he referred to as \u201cseeds of disease,\u201d existed in nature. Despite being invisible to human eyes, he postulated that these disease-causing organisms could be transmitted from person-to-person directly or via fomite intermediaries, thereby spreading contagion (Gensini and Conti 2004). He correctly surmised that syphilis was caused by such a microscopic organism. In his poem entitled \u201cSyphilis sive Morbus Gallicus\u201d (translated \u201cSyphilis or the French Disease\u201d) he described in remarkably accurate, yet mythical, poetic detail the clinical consequences of syphilis (Conrad et al. 1995). The Italians blamed syphilis on the French, hence the name \u201cthe French Disease\u201d; the French on the other hand referred to it as \u201cthe Italian Disease.\u201d This pattern of naming the syphilis epidemics based on local, political, or religious adversaries continued as the scourge spread throughout the western world and the Middle East (Sherman 2007).",

The first service was operated by physicians and medical students; the second by midwives. The mortality rate for puerperal or \u201cchild bed\u201d fever was such that one out of ten pregnant women could be expected to die shortly after birth from this dreaded complication. Semmelweis (Fig. 3.3) observed that the mortality rate was almost tenfold higher in the physician service as compared to the second service (Nuland 1979).

In 1847 Semmelweis showed that the introduction of hand washing between patient contacts reduced the mortality rate from puerperal fever by fourfold in 1 year (Wyklicky and Skopec 1983).",

He experienced profound, negative professional and personal consequences of his work.

Semmelweis countered with a series of harsh diatribes against his critics, essentially accusing his fellow physicians of killing their patients through negligence and intransigence to his new ideas about hand washing. His behavior in public and private became increasingly erratic; he fell into a deep melancholy eventually resulting in his involuntary commitment to an insane asylum.

The water intake for this pump was drawn from a location just downstream of a large sewer effluent from London in the Thames River.

Because chickens were in short supply in the laboratory, Pasteur was forced to recycle the same animals in subsequent experiments using freshly passed and highly virulent strains of bacteria. Remarkably, the chickens previously exposed to attenuated bacilli survived infection with virulent strains, whereas na\u00efve chickens died rapidly upon challenge. He surmised that serial passage of the bacteria at certain elevated temperature ranges and in the presence of oxygen resulted in organisms that could induce resistance to challenge using virulent forms of the same bacteria.",

Robert Koch (1843\u20131910) studied medicine at the University at G\u00f6ttingen where he came under the influence of the notable Professor of Anatomy Jakob Henle, an early proponent of the germ theory of disease, and learned the importance of careful animal experimentation in understanding disease causation. In the 1870s, as a district medical officer in the Prussian town of Wollstein, Koch (Fig. 3.7) began his investigations into the etiology of anthrax in sheep; this marked the beginning of a distinguished career in scientific research (Brock 1988). He identified anthrax bacilli in the blood of infected sheep and successfully transmitted the infection into healthy experimental animals. Using careful photomicroscopy and detailed drawings, he accurately described the life cycle of anthrax and the process of endospore formation. With the publication of this work in 1876, Koch became a major force in the fledgling field of microbiology.\n",

Using differential staining techniques, careful microscopy, and solid agar methods, Koch isolated the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in pure culture (Dubos and Dubos 1956). It was in this context that he initially proposed a set of criteria that had to be satisfied to infer an etiologic role for a specific bacterial agent in a particular disease. These conditions came to be known as \u201cKoch\u2019s Postulates\u201d and were eventually refined by Koch: the pathogen accounts for the clinical and pathological features of the disease and must be found in every case in which the disease occurs; the pathogen is not found in other diseases as a non-pathogen; after being isolated from the body and repeatedly passed in pure culture, the pathogen can induce the disease in animal models; and the same pathogen must be re-isolated from the experimental animal (Brock 1988). These criteria remained the gold standard upon which to judge evidence of microbial disease causation and are still valid to some extent today.",

This discovery eventually led the British physician Ronald Ross, working in India, to definitively prove the parasitic nature of malaria and its transmission by mosquitoes in 1896 (Sherman 2007). Contemporaneously, agricultural scientists in the Netherlands and Russia discovered the \u201cfilterable agent\u201d responsible for tobacco mosaic disease (Mayer 1886; Ivanowski 1892; Beijerinck 1898). These infectious particles were capable of passing through submicron filters that were known to capture bacteria; hence, a new discipline within microbiology was founded based on sub-microscopic entities that did not completely conform to Koch\u2019s well-accepted scientific dogma. The history of virology and advances in laboratory methodologies for cultivating these microorganisms are considered in detail in Chapter 9.",

            "text": "The history of microbiology in the twentieth century was dominated by research discoveries in genetics, nucleic acid biochemistry, and molecular biology. Since Charles Darwin\u2019s description of natural selection and variation and Gregor Mendel\u2019s work in defining the laws of genetics in the mid-nineteenth century, scientists had sought the biochemical basis for genes that determine the destiny of life forms on earth. Oswald Avery, Maclyn McCarty, and Colin MacLeod, working at the Rockefeller Institute identified the \u201choly grail\u201d of genetics in 1944 with their finding that the \u201ctransforming principle\u201d or genetic material of Streptococcus pneumoniae was deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), not protein as previously postulated (Lederberg 1994). This observation led to the elucidation of the structure of DNA in 1953 by James Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin, and Maurice Wilkins (Watson 1968), which in turn led to the deciphering of the genetic code by the former two scientists and ushered in the modern era of molecular biology. The first complete genomic sequencing, that of a bacteriophage was accomplished in 1977 (Sanger et al. 1982); that of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae Rd, was accomplished nearly two decades later (Fleischmann et al. 1995), followed shortly thereafter by the first draft of the human genome in 2001 (Altshuler 1995; Venter et al. 2001). Recent advances in microbiology, including the development of recombinant DNA technology, the polymerase chain reaction, and monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized clinical microbiology and permitted the use of non-culture methods to diagnose fastidious or non-cultivatable organisms such as hepatitis C, Trophyrema whippelii, and a variety of other organisms that likely contribute to human disease (Fredricks and Relman 1996).",

The innate immune system evolved in multicellular organisms to defend against invasion by microorganisms. Adaptive or acquired immunity evolved relatively late in vertebrate evolution through the acquisition of large retro-transposons within the genome to accommodate the increasing longevity of complex organisms and to provide long term immunologic memory against potential pathogens to which the host has had previous immunologic exposure. The mechanisms that underlie the capacity of the host to orchestrate an appropriate immune defense have been the focus of research for generations of scientists.

Ilya Metchnikoff (1845\u20131916) is credited with first recognizing phagocytosis as an important cellular defense strategy (Ambrose 2006). Metchnikoff (Fig. 3.9), a comparative zoologist from the village of Kharkov in modern-day Ukraine, reasoned that this highly advantageous host defense he observed in starfish mesenchymal cells would be found in higher species as well (Silverstein 2003). Aware of the potential significance of his findings, he changed his career path to human pathology and microbiology. With colleagues at the Pasteur Institute, Metchnikoff confirmed that phagocytosis by neutrophils (\u201cmicrocytes\u201d) and macrophages was an essential part of the innate immune response in humans. He promulgated the idea of cell-mediated immunity as a defense against specific sets of microbial pathogens in 1884.\n",

This formed the basis for the use of serum therapy for toxin-mediated infectious diseases, a strategy that became widely used by both the Koch and Pasteur groups. Behring was awarded the inaugural the Nobel Prize in 1901 for his work on immune therapy; Ehrlich and Metchnikoff shared the Nobel Prize in 1908 for their descriptions of humoral and cellular immunity, respectively (Silverstein 2005; Gensini et al. 2007).\n\n",

While Karl Landsteiner\u2019s work in the early twentieth century questioned the plausibility that the human body could respond to the array of potential antigens found in the environment in this manner (Figl and Pelinka 2004), Australian virologist-turned-immunologist F. Macfarlane Burnet proposed an alternative hypothesis in 1956 based on modifications of the theories of Danish immunologist Niels Jerne. Burnet\u2019s clonal selection theory, describing the activation, clonal proliferation, and subsequent targeted antibody secretion of lymphocytes after binding to a matched antigen, reconciled experimental observations and was subsequently shown to be the correct explanation for the generation of antibody diversity (Burnet 1957).",

The discovery of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (Carswell et al. 1975) and interleukin-1 (Auron et al. 1984) were major milestones in understanding immune cell signaling and response, a field advanced further by the discovery of the toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the early 1990s (Beutler et al. 2006). The definition of TLR4 as the lipopolysaccharide receptor capped a century-long search for the receptor for bacterial endotoxin and brought immunology full circle back to its bacteriologic roots (Beutler and Poltorak 2000).",

Future advances are anticipated when the genomics era in which we now live and the promise of systems biology and personalized medicine are fully realized in the next few decades. A remarkable story of directed inquiry into the fundamental nature of microbes and immune defenses preceded many of the current advances in medicine. Much work remains before the benefits of these discoveries can be applied equally worldwide.",
