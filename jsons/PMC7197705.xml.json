However, no well-defined process or effective integration methodology, in combination with a widely accepted system representation has been developed to provide a comprehensive view of a biological system. Biological systems are currently presented in a variety of forms, such as relational databases (Galperin, 2004), diagrams (Kohn, 1999; Peleg et al., 2002), ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000) and markup language (Hucka et al., 2003), but they are integrated through an ill-defined, informal process. This assortment of information integration methods can hamper biological studies, especially of large complex systems. A well-defined process and integration technology can orchestrate system-level integration efforts by biologists, computer scientists and engineers, and provide consistency and manageability during integration.",

This resemblance is particularly evident in a comparison between object-oriented software and typical biological systems (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 1). Both systems are based on components and protocols, and their layered control mechanisms allow them to efficiently handle complexity. This complexity is further managed by subsystems, both in biological and object-oriented software systems. Furthermore, these systems contain static time-independent and dynamic time-dependent relationships. This resemblance has led to a very similar architecture and system-level organization, making it possible to represent a biological system as an object-oriented software system.",

First, a well-defined software engineering process, such as the waterfall model, Rational Unified Process, agile process, etc. (Graham, 2001), is needed to specify stepwise activities and define what should be accomplished during software development. Second, object-oriented technology, a paradigm of software development, including object-oriented programming, analysis, design and database centered on the object concept, is vital for object-oriented software development. This technology is used to dissect real-world problems and create an object-oriented software system to solve these problems. Third, a widely accepted object-oriented modeling language, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML) (Rumbaugh et al., 1999), should be used to represent this object-oriented system. This visual representation can help to organize and communicate a complex software system as small, manageable pieces without losing system integrity. While these components were specifically designed for successful software development, they can be adapted for biological system information integration.",

Therefore, the integration of biological information at the system level can be approached by reverse engineering the biological system into an object-oriented software architecture. Following a well-defined software development process to reverse engineer a biological system offers significant advantages. Although simple systems can be easily modeled by an indiscriminate approach, a formal approach is necessary for the creation of complex system models, such as those found in biology. Moreover, when this methodology is applied to biological system modeling, the distinct phases of software development allow tasks best suited for biologists or computer scientists to be divided and coordinated. In addition, applying a well-defined software engineering process and object-oriented methodology provide an effective means to capture specifications from experimental data and integrate the biological system information. Finally, this process provides a guideline for the development of an integrated biological system, represented as an object-oriented software architecture, in a widely accepted object-oriented modeling language (such as UML), which can facilitate communication about complex systems among software engineers, biologists and other users. Recently, biologists have also begun to develop and specify processes for biological data integration, such as the one used for the TRANSPATH database (Schacherer et al., 2001), but this activity has been fairly limited and has not gained the community-wide acceptance comparable with popular software engineering processes.",

            "text": "To demonstrate the efficacy of a well-defined software engineering process in the translation of a biological system to a model grounded in object-oriented principles, we used UML in the development of a severe acquired respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) model. SARS-CoV, which killed nearly 800 people and infected 8000 worldwide, consists of 28 structural and non-structural proteins. Although the viral infection and replication process is not entirely resolved, some details have emerged. Briefly, the virus binds to the cellular ACE2 receptor via its spike (S) protein, then fuses with the host cell membrane (Li et al., 2003). Genomic RNA is released, and gene one, encoding the non-structural replicase proteins is translated. The replicase proteins are cleaved by the papain-like proteinase (Rota et al., 2003) and 3C-like protease (Fan et al., 2004) also contained within gene one. The replicase produces the structural protein mRNAs from the remaining genome, which are subsequently translated. The structural proteins (Ying et al., 2004) consist of the membrane (M) (Rottier et al., 1986) and envelope (E) (Yu et al., 1994) proteins, which form the viral envelope, the S protein that binds the cellular receptor (Xiao et al., 2003) and nucleocapsid (N) protein, which associates with the viral RNA to form the ribonucleoprotein (Ying et al., 2004). The recently identified transmembrane proteins U274 and U122 may also serve as structural proteins (Fielding et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2004). The virus assembles in an intermediate compartment between the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997), and is released via the constitutive exocytic pathway (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). In this paper, we demonstrate that a complex biological system can be reverse-engineered, and the resulting software representation can capture the static and dynamic relationships contained with the system.",

This approach is suitable because of the relative simplicity of the viral infection process. Since the major activities (such as requirement gathering, analysis and design) of this sequential software process serve as the foundation for other advanced software engineering processes, these advanced processes can be applied to modeling more complex biological systems. The requirement-gathering phase entails collecting all available information about the system, generating CRC cards (see Supplemental Figure 1) to capture biological entity (bioentity) functions and collaborators, and defining a use case (see Supplemental Figure 2). The analysis phase is used to dissect the interrelationships among components involved in viral infection and serves as a basis for the detailed models generated in the design phase. Here, the gathered information is used to create a use case diagram (see Supplemental Figure 3), conceptual model (see Supplemental Figure 4) and system sequence diagram (see Supplemental Figure 5). In the design phase, information from the analysis and requirement-gathering stages is incorporated to develop a detailed model, which represents the static (class diagram, see Supplemental Figures 14\u201316 and Figure 4) and dynamic (for state diagram see Supplemental Figure 6, for sequence diagram see Supplemental Figures 7\u20139 and Figure 2, and for activity diagrams see Supplemental Figures 10\u201313 and Figure 3) nature of the SARS-CoV genome and infection process.

A high-level representation of the SARS viral infection is reflected chronologically in Figure 2. Simple (such as proteins) or complex (such as viral replicase or virus) bioentities, identified by literature searches, are modeled as objects, which are represented by rectangles with vertical lifelines. Object functions, which are implemented by the methods contained within the objects, are used to represent the functions of these bioentities. For example, a viral replicase can take a viral RNA as a template and generates a new viral RNA through replication.

This invocation of an object function by another is described as one object sending a message to another object. In this way, real-world processes may be captured using an object-oriented approach. For instance, the cell object can call the translation machinery to translate the viral replicase by sending a message translate(in: Positive_Genomic_RNA), where the value after the \u2018in\u2019 is an object, Positive_Genomic_RNA, that must first be passed into the method. To complete the process, the translation machinery will use this Positive_Genomic_RNA as a template to translate and create a \u2018viral replicase\u2019 object, which is sent back to the cell. The cell now contains a copy of the viral replicase for later use. Together, this message passing captures the cellular process of translation of a viral RNA into a viral replicase.",

Together, the events leading to the creation of a virus can be chronologically ordered and can mimic the viral infection process. Additional details that reflect the RNA replication process, translation of the structural proteins and viral assembly are available in Supplemental Figures 7\u20139.

Unlike the sequence diagram, which captures best-case scenario events, the action sequence or flow of the activity diagram can portray alternative outcomes. For instance, as shown in Figure 3, a virus may bind a receptor if one is available, or else this action ends and the flow is directed to the final state. Once bound, if the S protein undergoes a conformational change that exposes the fusion peptide, then the virus can fuse with the cellular membrane. Alternatively, the virus may detach from the cell, or if a neighboring cell is available cell\u2013cell fusion may be initiated or the flow may be directed to the final state, indicating that infection failed. If the virus is able to fuse with the membrane, release of the N protein will decoat the positive genomic RNA, or else this action will also end. Once decoated, the viral RNA is replicated after which the virus is assembled and released. These subactivities are presented in greater detail in Supplemental Figures 11\u201313. In addition, Supplemental Figure 10 illustrates a high-level view reflecting only the major stages of the viral infection process.

These relationships include SARS-CoV binding to the cell receptor, viral protein interacting with the translation machinery and RNA interacting with the viral replicase. To capture this static architecture, class diagrams were generated that model the components, operations and interrelationships that occur between the SARS-CoV and cell. Specifically, Figure 4, a high-level class diagram, captures the major components of the SARS virus and viral infection as objects and their associations using an object-oriented representation. These objects, where applicable, were given attributes that describe important characteristics, or if changed, might alter the function of a component. The object functions, which parallel bioentity functions, were generated from the sequence diagrams. These functions or operations are a declaration of the methods that an object may use. In addition, protein complexes can be represented, as in the case of the viral replicase, as complex objects, which are composed of many other objects (see Supplemental Figure 15). Similarly, utilizing composition allows the virus object to mimic a real-world virus, which contains structural proteins, positive genomic RNA and a membrane (Fig. 4). Larger systems such as organelles and pathways can also be contained within the object-oriented software system in the form of modules, subsystems or packages. In this way, class diagrams allow a biological system to be captured as a layered system, e.g. the cellular translation machinery may be represented as a single object, even though it has a very complex mechanism and regulation. This complexity could also be captured in a subsystem that specifically focuses on the cellular translation machinery. This layered structure indicates that the object-oriented technology can be used to represent the layered structure of complex biological systems.",

We have leveraged the power of the UML to construct our object-oriented software representation of the SARS-CoV and its infection process. Even though UML has been proposed as a tool to model biological systems (Bornberg-Bauer and Paton, 2002; Roux-Rouquie et al., 2004), and an overview of the modeling process used in the development of biological simulation software is available (Johnson et al., 2004), without a well-defined methodology and software-engineering process, such as object-oriented analysis and design, transforming biological information into UML becomes an ad hoc activity. However, by applying object-oriented analysis and design, biological entities and related information can be systematically transformed into an object-oriented system by this well-defined methodology. Furthermore, UML is created to represent object-oriented software systems. If a biological system itself is directly represented by UML, but not as an object-oriented software system, this representation may be confusing and the full capabilities of UML may not be achieved. Reverse engineering a biological system into an object-oriented system ensures that the object-oriented system can be accurately and completely represented by UML. Additional tools such as class-responsibility-collaboration cards (Wilkinson, 1998), which can be used to capture the attributes, collaborators and functions of the annotated object, may also be employed to capture data not fully represented by the UML notation.",

This challenge can be met by applying object encapsulation: defining the behavior of an object through its operations that are accessible to other objects, but hiding the underlining mechanism of the operations and object attributes from other objects (Graham, 2001). For example, to communicate that the translation machinery translates a viral protein does not require that every component of the translation machinery be detailed. Specifically, to capture this information we gave the translation machinery a function called \u2018translate\u2019. This function will create a viral protein from the viral mRNA without defining the real process of how the viral protein is created.

To integrate new information into existing models, a system, such as a web portal, will have to be implemented that also allows experts to contribute to model maturation. The Alliance for Cellular Signaling (http://www.signaling-gateway.org/) has already set a precedence for such a collaboration. This approach is especially suitable for object-oriented system development, since the modular nature of an object-oriented system allows the modification of individual components without affecting other parts of the system. Together, these approaches will distribute the burden of creating these models. Because portions of a model might be derived from information that contains varying degrees of confidence, in the future, UML models might benefit from the addition of a confidence indicator to indicate whether portions of a model are derived from experimental data or are based on hypothesis and speculation. While this study has focused on the construction of a web-based system for navigation of the layered structure of a biological system, future work will also strive to integrate information into a searchable database, and implement software systems to simulate biological processes. Finally, to extend this application to a more complex biological system, it will be necessary to adopt an advanced iterative process, such as the Rational Unified Process (Kruchten, 2003), or apply advanced techniques, such as Fa\u00e7ade pattern (Gamma et al., 1997), in object-oriented design to reduce the complexity of the system.

Similar to software engineering projects, the well-defined software process makes the biological system information integration repeatable, controllable, scalable and manageable. The resulting object-oriented system not only captures information about individual components but also displays the system-level architecture and interrelationships among system components. Furthermore, this object-oriented model captures system dynamics, in that the key events and the process of viral infection are also described. Our research demonstrates that object-oriented analysis and design can be employed as an effective methodology to integrate biological information, and the UML representation is a comprehensive approach to capturing the complexity of biological systems, integrating biological information and facilitating communication between biologists and computer scientists.",

Functions and events associated with these bioentities are modeled as messages sent to the corresponding objects. These message calls, indicated by solid arrows, are made between objects via connection of their lifelines. Messages contain a message name followed by parameters, which must be passed into the object and/or outputted from the object, e.g. translation machinery executes its function of translating viral mRNA by receiving a translate message \u2018translate (in: Positive_Genomic_RNA)\u2019 from the cell. This message accepts a Positive_Genomic_RNA as a template, indicated by \u2018in: Positive_Genomic_RNA\u2019, then a \u2018Viral_Replicase\u2019 is created and returned. These return values are displayed below the message call as a named dotted arrow extending in the opposite direction as the original message call. Where return values are not explicitly indicated, as in an object calling itself (), an \u2018out\u2019 followed by a return value is substituted.

The process of RNA replication, assembly and viral release are detailed in Supplemental Figures 10\u201313. All activity diagrams have a pseudo-start () and pseudo-end () states. Action states, represented by rounded rectangles () are captured during different time periods. This diagram can represent sequential as well as concurrent events. Concurrent events are represented by forks () and merges (). This architecture signifies that multiple events are possible simultaneously and the occurrence of at least one of these events is enough to continue the flow of control. In contrast, the flow of control may also be conditional, e.g. decision diamonds (\u22c4) represent a point at which alternative events can occur. At these decision diamonds, guard conditions must be satisfied for the flow of control to continue, or else the flow of control follows an alternative route.",

Interactions may contain cardinalities at their ends indicating the number of objects that interact with another object.
