            "text": "Background: Delirium is a serious and distressing neurocognitive disorder of physiological aetiology that is common in advanced cancer. Understanding of delirium pathophysiology is largely hypothetical, with some evidence for involvement of inflammatory systems, neurotransmitter alterations and glucose metabolism. To date, there has been limited empirical consideration of the distinction between delirium pathophysiology and that of the underlying disease, for example, cancer where these mechanisms are also common in advanced cancer syndromes such as pain and fatigue. This systematic review explores biomarker overlap in delirium, specific advanced cancerrelated syndromes and prediction of cancer prognosis. Methods: A systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42017068662) was conducted, using MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Web of Science, to identify body fluid biomarkers in delirium, cancer prognosis and advanced cancer-related syndromes of interest. Studies were excluded if they reported delirium tremens only; did not measure delirium using a validated tool; the sample had less than 75% of participants with advanced cancer; measured tissue, genetic or animal biomarkers, or were conducted post-mortem. Articles were screened for inclusion independently by two authors, and data extraction and an in-depth quality assessment conducted by one author, and checked by two others. Results: The 151 included studies were conducted in diverse settings in 32 countries between 1985 and 2017, involving 28130 participants with a mean age of 69.3 years. Seventy-one studies investigated delirium biomarkers, and 80 studies investigated biomarkers of an advanced cancer-related syndrome or cancer prognosis. Overall, 41 biomarkers were studied in relation to both delirium and either an advanced cancer-related syndrome or prognosis; and of these, 24 biomarkers were positively associated with either delirium or advanced cancer syndromes/ prognosis in at least one study. The quality assessment showed large inconsistency in reporting. Conclusion: There is considerable overlap in the biomarkers in delirium and advanced cancer-related syndromes. Improving the design of delirium biomarker studies and considering appropriate comparator/controls will help to better understanding the discrete pathophysiology of delirium in the context of co-existing illness.",

Current hypotheses include: neuronal ageing, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neuroendocrine dysregulation, disruption to the circadian rhythm, and neurotransmitter dysregulation [10, 11] . A reduction in glucose metabolism seen in people with delirium is a model with developing evidence [12, 13] . Collectively, the biological correlates of delirium are referred to as 'delirium biomarkers'. A biomarker is a biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process, or of a condition or disease [14] . Biomarkers are most commonly studied to investigate their correlation with a disease in order to better understand its underlying pathophysiology, and subsequently inform prevention and treatment strategies for that disease. A challenge for the field of delirium research is that correlation may exist between biomarkers of delirium and those of the patient's disease or injury which placed them at increased risk of delirium, or which precipitated it (for example sepsis or hip fracture). Such correlation should be factored into delirium biomarker research, yet rarely has been. Better understanding of the interplay between delirium pathophysiology and that of correlated conditions and diseases, for example, cancer (the focus of this review), is crucial to develop more effective prevention and treatment of delirium.",

Additional terms which encompassed commonly researched biomarkers were also included. Filters in Medline were: 1: Humans; 2. English language and 3. Published from 1980 onward (when delirium was first included in the DSM, Third Edition (DSM-III)). Search terms and filters were tailored to each subsequent database, as required.

Studies were set in a large range of settings, with the most common in general hospital settings (n=111; 73%). Thirtynine studies (26%) did not report the setting. Sample sizes ranged from 7-2456, with relatively even numbers of male and female participants (55.4% male). Ninety nine articles reported a mean age, with an overall weighted mean age of 69.3 years. Of the 37 articles that reported the median age of participants, the overall median age was 54.5 years. The overall age of participants in the remaining 15 articles was not possible to determine (Additional files 2 and 3). Blood biomarkers were examined in 138 studies, 4 studies examined biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 3 in urine, and 16 (11%) did not report the type of biological material. Of the studies that reported the assay technique, diverse assays were used (n=20), with Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) being the most common (n=62; 58%). Fortyfour studies (29%) did not report the specific assay used. Of these, 21 studies (48%) were routinely measured biomarkers (Tables 1 and 2). A total of 41 biomarkers were found to be common in both delirium and advanced cancer syndrome studies. The five most commonly studied biomarkers were Creactive protein (CRP) (n=79), interleukin (IL)-6 (n=58), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) (n=42) IL-10 (n= 21) and IL-8 (n=24). Of these, 24 biomarkers had a positive association with delirium, cancer prognosis or a cancer syndrome in at least one study. No cancer studies reported having any participants with delirium, and of the delirium studies, six reported participants with cancer. Figure 2 illustrates two main populations identified from this systematic review, with the centre showing the 'true overlap' defined as studies that included participants with both delirium and cancer (n=6 studies).",

The findings of this systematic review suggest that categorization along these lines is less understood in delirium. For example, there is evidence to show that conditions such as sepsis and hip fracture cause changes in inflammatory markers [177, 178] , however, there is little evidence about whether delirium self-propagates. Some animal model data in delirium suggests that there might be a direct impact of inflammatory markers on brain dysfunction [179] . To our knowledge there was no published relationship between tumor markers and neurological brain dysfunction. Although clinical evidence suggests long term impacts on brain function, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood, and biomarkers to measure this are also unclear.",

            "text": "Several studies have previously been performed to determine biomarkers associated with delirium, however potential confounding factors could be the underlying precipitants of delirium; ie risk factors (sepsis), or underlying conditions present (for example cancer or dementia). The top five most commonly studies biomarkers in this review were inflammatory biomarkers, namely, CRP, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10 and IL-8. The challenge with inflammatory markers is that they are nonspecific and the inflammatory pathways are similar to those implicated in other conditions such as sepsis and depression [181, 182] . Likewise, of the six delirium studies where there was concomitant cancer, it is very difficult to determine whether those biomarkers found were related to the cancer or the delirium itself, considering alterations in inflammatory pathways are implicated in both. Therefore, future delirium biomarker studies need to be prospectively evaluated and take into account and assess robustly other active co-morbidities such as cancer that could plausibly impact on the pathophysiological and/or biological findings. Similarly, future cancer biomarker studies must also take into account how delirium may clinically or biologically confound biomarker studies in cancer, considering the high prevalence of delirium in this population. Of the six delirium studies with cancer, three did not report the type of cancer, and of the remaining three studies, none were primary brain tumours or brain metastases. Understanding the spread of brain cancer is important in delirium studies, and is an important consideration for future delirium biomarker studies.",

Where studies only undertook univariate analysis, it is uncertain whether any observed changes in biomarkers were related to the delirium itself, or whether these changes may have been lost when adjusted for confounding factors (such as prior cognitive impairment) in a multivariate analysis. Furthermore, there is likely to be a higher proportion of participants with both delirium and cancer in both groups of studies for which this clinical information was not assessed or that were not reported. Key methodological issues which need to be addressed in future delirium studies include adjusting for confounders such as age, gender, concurrent medication, comorbidities, prior cognitive impairment, frailty and other neurological conditions. These clinical covariates must also be clearly defined and justified. Assay procedures ought to be reported in detail, including a detailed protocol of the reagents/kits used, repeatability assessments, methods of preservation and storage, assay validity, sensitivity limits of the assay and a scoring and reporting protocol. The timing of the assay is crucial in delirium studies, and the fluctuating pathophysiological processes occurring during delirium, after delirium resolution, and in those who have not yet developed delirium, must be taken into consideration, and be separated in future studies. More standardised and detailed methods of delirium biomarker studies is a crucial step in carrying out future subgroup analyses within this cohort and improving the overall understanding of delirium pathophysiology.",

It is possible that articles were missed; however, two reviewers independently screened all citations derived from a search of six relevant and diverse databases, and all reference lists of included articles were also searched. Another limitation of our study is the lack of a risk of bias tool for biomarker studies, therefore we used an adaptation of tumor marker reporting guidelines, the REMARK checklist [23] . Lastly, the heterogeneity of the data precluded the conduct of a meta-analysis, and precluded any firm conclusions about the biomarkers in delirium and cancer, thus, limiting the rigor of this review. Strengths of this review however, were that we undertook a systematic approach adhering to the PRISMA [15] and an extensive quality assessment of the included studies was undertaken.",
