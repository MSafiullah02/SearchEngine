            "text": "is by far the most dangerous coronavirus ever identified for the third time in the three decades capable of infecting not only the animals but also the humans across the globe. Nearly 6000 deaths have been recorded due mainly to COVID-19 outbreak worldwide and more than 50% of these deaths appeared to have evolved from China where the virus was thought to originate. The endemicity of COVID-19 dramatically surpassed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that were so far discovered in 2003 and 2012 respectively. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak not only a public health emergency but also pandemic in nature. Currently, over 120 countries including Nigeria were reported to have more than 157,844 confirmed cases and 5,846 deaths due mainly to COVID-19 outbreak as of March 15, 2020, 10:55 GMT. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely used to aid in the prediction, detection, response, recovery of disease and making clinical diagnosis. In this study, we highlighted the power of AI in the containment and mitigation of the spread of COVID-19 outbreak in African countries such as Nigeria where human to human contact is apparently inevitable.",

World Health Organization (WHO) has declared 2019-nCoV outbreak pandemic that negatively affected the world's economy [34, 2, 3] . The first case of international symposium on coronaviruses (CoVs) was held in 1980 and the major advances with regard to CoVs have emanated in 1983 due to application of molecular biology techniques including cloning and sequencing of the avian and murine genomes [32, 27, 28, 12, 15] . CoVs such as 2019-nCoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to cause a wide range of diseases in humans and animals [25, 31, 32, 38, 36, 12] . However, many researchers are of the opinion that, the virus originated from animals and spreads to human beings after which they infect each other [23, 24, 4] . CoV is likely the third time in three decade to jump from infecting animals to human beings [16] . SARS and MERS-CoVs are coronaviruses that were discovered in 2003 and 2012 respectively and are responsible for acute respiratory syndrome in humans in the Middle East, Europe, North Africa, and the United States of America [35, 36, 12] . However, the severity of 2019-nCoV appears to dramatically exceed SARS and MERS-CoVs [12, 16, 38, 36, 18] The first case of the disease in sub-Africa has been confirmed in Lagos State -Nigeria on 25 th February, 2020",

CoV was predicted by AI long before the world really knows much about it [4, 5, 20, 21] . Intelligence system that sifts the data about people was developed by AI Startup Company called BlueDot, determines by far the chances of disease occurrence [4, 5] . The team of BlueDot confirmed that, the information its systems has relayed and informed its clients predicted 2019-nCoV pandemic long before Chinese and WHO made official announcement [4, 5] . The system predicted 2019-nCoV pandemic and turned out to be true. The system alerted the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV in December, 2019 and later became true as the outbreak appeared to be the mainstream on 2nd February, 2020 [9, 4, 5] . This shows and attests the powerful nature of AI technology. Therefore, the power of the AI cannot be underestimated, had it been the prediction of the system had been acknowledged many people around the world would not have been the victims of COVID-19.",

Similarly, the whole process of testing 2019-nCoV takes 5 -7 hours [15, 7] . However, AI Based Smart image reading system to diagnose COVID-19 has been developed by China based company [1, 4] . The system reads the CT images in seconds rather than minutes [1, 4, 8] . The system is already being used to scan more than 5000 patients [7] . The AI Based System can pinpoint the COVID-19 from computed tomography images in about 15 seconds with 90% accuracy compared to 15 minutes by human physicians [17] . The analysis engine of the AI Based Smart Image Reading System measures changes in lesion, tracks development of COVID-19 and thus evaluates treatment [17, 4] . The system is also a cloud based which can be accessed by radiologists via cloud [17] . AI Based Standing X-ray Machine is currently building by Nanox that will supply tomographic images of the lungs [26] . The machine is to be installed in public places such as train stations, airports, seaports, land borders or anywhere else where large groups of people rub shoulders [21, 26] . The system attracted investments funds to capitalize on AI's potential for thwarting COVID-19 epidemics as such Foxconn invested $26 million to supply 1,000 systems to medical imaging services across New Zealand, Australia and Norway [26, 21, 22] . Therefore, this is one of the greatest testimonies to how the future of the epidemic prevention of 2091-CoV lies on the power of AI. AI Based System is currently being developed by In-Silico Medicine, Startup Company [8, 3] . The system will be informing doctors about the molecules that are capable of fighting COVID-19 [4] . AI Based System is fast and accurate having recently analyzed molecules and provided feedback about the molecules suited to counter the virus [3, 4] . The company is developing database of molecules that medical researchers can use in their projects and more so to use the database towards combating the further outbreak of the 2019-nCoV [4] . John Brownstein who is the chief officer at Harvard Medical School used AI techniques called machine leaning to comb through news reports, social media posts and data from official public heath channels and information sourced from doctors for warning signs of 2019-nCoV taking hold in countries outside",
