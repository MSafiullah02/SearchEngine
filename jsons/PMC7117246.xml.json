            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a coronavirus causing FIP that is characterized by polyserositis, vasculitis and severe lymphopenia (Addie et al., 2009). This disease has fascinated cat researchers for already half a century (Holzworth, 1963) but up until now, it cannot be treated/controlled in an efficient way. None of the conventional antivirals and therapeutics have been found effective against FIPV infection (Hartmann and Ritz, 2008). At present, it is the most important viral cause of death in cats. The current hypothesis states that FIPV arises through mutation from the avirulent coronavirus feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) (Chang et al., 2010). Additionally, FIPV is very immune evasive, especially toward the humoral branch of immunity (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980, Cornelissen et al., 2007, Dewerchin et al., 2008). About 30 years ago, Pedersen and Black (1983) already stated that a strong cell-mediated immune response (CMI) is key to surviving a FIPV infection. Cats with a strong CMI would survive, while cats with weaker CMI would develop disease (Pedersen and Black, 1983).",

They can lyse virus-infected cells directly, secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines or modulate ensuing innate and adaptive immune responses (Jonjic et al., 2008). Regulatory T cells (Tregs) on the other hand are central players in the adaptive branch of CMI. They are characterized by the expression of CD4, CD25 and Foxp3 and function to maintain an immunological balance that allows to resolve pathogen infection while minimizing immunopathology. Virus-induced enhancement of Treg function and frequencies may lead to persistent infection and possibly pathogen induced pathology while subversion of Tregs (virus or host induced) may cause damaging immunopathology (Belkaid and Rouse, 2005, Li et al., 2008). Foxp3 can also be expressed in other cells than classical Tregs, such as CD4+CD25\u2212 cells, CD8+ T cells and CD21+ B cells. These cells have been shown to be implicated in tumor immunology and autoimmunity, where they have an immunosuppressive role (Han et al., 2009, Leavy, 2010, Mauri and Bosma, 2012).",

A strong innate NK cell-mediated immune response is often responsible for an acute viral control, exemplified during FIV and cytomegalovirus infections (Zingoni et al., 2005, Howard et al., 2010), while Treg enhancement suppresses anti-viral responses (Li et al., 2008). NK cell deficiencies regularly lead to severe recurrent viral diseases (Wood et al., 2011) and Treg deficiencies lead to damaging pathology (Luhn et al., 2007).",

Traditionally, mononuclear cells from blood are isolated over Ficoll-Paque, which typically produces a variable yield. Additionally, blood analysis by clinical labs takes some time to be performed, which can have a deleterious effect on cell viability during transport and subsequently on cell frequencies and functions (Bull et al., 2007). That is why in these experiments, the absolute amount of cells was calculated with a combination of several methods. First, 10 ml of blood was taken from the vena jugularis in heparin (15 U ml\u22121) (Leo, Zaventem, Belgium). Then, a blood smear was prepared and subsequently stained with a diff-quick staining (Gomez-Ochoa et al., 2012). This staining provided the percentage of the lymphocyte population in the total white blood cell population. This percentage was then applied to the total white blood cell count from a diagnostic analysis. This gave accurate absolute lymphocyte counts in the whole blood. Finally, blood mononuclear cells were separated on Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Staining of the mononuclear cells (vide infra) then allowed identification and absolute quantification of all lymphocyte subsets. One cm2 of kidney cortex, containing lesion tissue if present, and most of the mesentery was dissected from all cats and weighed afterwards. Cells in tissue were isolated by passing subsequently through tissue grinders (250 \u03bcM mesh) (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) and cell strainers (70 \u03bcM mesh) (Becton, Dickinson and Company, New Yersey, USA). After isolation, cells were counted, frozen (PTLPD81, Orthodyne, Alleur, Belgium) and stored at \u2212196 \u00b0C in liquid nitrogen.",

Explanations for this lymphopenia vary from virus-induced NK cell apoptosis to sequestration and altered trafficking of NK cells (Denney et al., 2010) (He et al., 2005, Mao et al., 2009, Howard et al., 2010). The Treg depletion that is seen during FIPV infection, somewhat contrasts other viral infections, which are nearly always associated with either an increase in Treg frequency or function (Keynan et al., 2008). One exception is HIV infection, which is characterized by decreased peripheral Treg numbers. However, the latter appears to result from Treg trafficking to lymph nodes and other places of viral replication (Andersson et al., 2005). More recent studies indicate that this Treg migration to sites of virus replication and lymphoid tissue is even vital for proper immune regulation (Belkaid and Tarbell, 2009, Campbell and Koch, 2011). In the current study, the opposite was noted, with extreme Treg depletion in all examined immunologic compartments. In addition, no evidence of elevated Treg numbers in inflamed tissue could be found. This depletion may likely contribute to the uncontrolled inflammatory responses that cause the typical immunopathology, which is lethal to FIPV-infected cats.",

These cells have also been detected in cats (Lankford et al., 2008) and we verified the existence of these subsets in cats and detected a significant reduction of CD8+ Tregs and CD4+CD25\u2212 Tregs in both blood and LN of FIPV-infected cats. Curiously, a significantly elevated number of CD8+ Tregs was noted in the kidney of FIPV-infected cats. This could imply an immunoevasive strategy of FIPV, by upregulating CD8+ Treg numbers and thus suppressing immunity at sites of infection. These cells, currently a hot topic in human immunology, seem to be implicated in tumor immunology and autoimmunity (Han et al., 2009, Leavy, 2010, Mauri and Bosma, 2012).",

This indicates that the T and B cell depletion, typical for FIP cats, is also present to a comparable extent in the NK cell and Treg compartment.

The relative increase that was seen in our experiments could indicate that peripheral NK cells in FIP cats are more equipped to either migrate to the lymphoid tissues or the inflamed tissues that are ubiquitously present in an average FIPV diseased cat. However, NK cell enumeration did not reveal an increase in NK numbers in inflamed mesentery and kidney and even a major decrease in the LN. Another possibility might be that certain subsets (e.g. CD62L\u2212) of NK cells are more sensitive to the FIPV induced lymphopenia, resulting in a relative increase in CD62L+ NK cell numbers. This is not necessarily a disadvantage for the FIPV diseased cats, since recent developments in human immunology indicate that CD62L could be used to define an intermediate state of NK cell maturation that performs both the cytotoxic as well as the cytokine producing functions, two functions that are normally divided between CD56dim and CD56bright NK subsets in blood (Juelke et al., 2010). This hypothesis however needs further examination with respect to feline NK cell maturation stages.",

Similar results were seen in activated, inflamed human LN where significant increases in CD16+ NK cell frequencies were noted in comparison to non-inflamed LN (Romagnani et al., 2007). The authors envisaged a system where, very early during an immune response, immature NK cells are recruited to LN from where they recirculate after maturation (e.g. acquisition of CD16). Our findings (relative CD16+ NK cell increase in both blood and LN and a relative increase of CD62L+ LN NK cells) agree with this hypothesis, giving the LN a central role in FIPV immunity. Lastly, FIPV LN also showed a significant decrease in relative NKT cell numbers (CD3+CD56+). This enigmatic subset often plays a crucial role in promoting and enhancing early innate and adaptive responses as has been shown for herpes simplex virus (Grubor-Bauk et al., 2008). Virus-induced loss of these cells could compromise the host's capacity to control early virus infection and spread, resulting in higher viral loads as is the case for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and HIV (Tessmer et al., 2009).",

            "text": "To evaluate if the more activated NK phenotype in FIP cats leads to higher cytolytic capacities, a functional assay was performed on CRFK cells, similar to Vermeulen et al. (2012). This test was only performed on NK (CD3\u2212CD56+) cells from LN and spleen, since NK cell counts in blood from FIP cats were too low. NKT cells (CD3+CD56+) were also included in the functional assay, since these cells have recently been shown to possess NK-like cytotoxic abilities (Kuylenstierna et al., 2011). Results revealed NK and NKT cells isolated from LN in FIP cats to be significantly less cytotoxic while splenic NK and NKT cells showed no differences in cytotoxicity. This indicates that, even though NK cells from FIP cats show a more activated phenotype and relatively more CD16+ cells, they display a reduced capacity to lyse target cells in vitro, in comparison with NK cells from healthy cats. Normally, viruses induce a NK response that is characterized by a higher cytolytic capacity (e.g. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)) (Long et al., 2010). Some viruses however, have evolved to induce lower functionality in NK cells (e.g. HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV)) (Meier et al., 2005). One explanation for the lower cytotoxicity could be a proportional dysregulation of functional subsets, similar to the dysregulation seen in HIV-patients where less CD16+ NK cells (the cytotoxic subset) are detected. However, the opposite was found during FIPV infection, i.e. higher amounts of CD16+ cells. Another possibility could be a lowered granulation, a prerequisite for inducing cytolysis. To test this hypothesis, several antibodies against CD107a were tested. Unfortunately, none of these showed cross reactivity with the cat system. Finally, differences in NK cell homeostasis between several subsets could be present, through for example different survival or generation rates, which could lead to a proportional dysregulation similar as proposed for HIV infection (Meier et al., 2005). Splenic NK cells did not reveal any differences in functionality between healthy and FIP cats. This could be the consequence of the different anatomy of the feline spleen, resulting in different trafficking patterns, which could take the edge of any virus-induced alternations in frequency, phenotype or functionality (Blue and Weiss, 1981, Mebius and Kraal, 2005). Analysis of Treg functionality was not possible due to too low cell numbers in immunological compartments.",

Tissue from FIP-mesentery and -kidney without lesions showed comparable results to tissue with lesions, both with regard to cell frequency and functionality. Similarly, results from the cat without effusion also showed no difference with the effusive cats. This indicates that both cell frequency and function, are not associated with the disease pattern (effusive\u2013non effusive) that follows infection nor in the disease severity (presence of lesions). Possibly, there are other cellular immunity associated factors, such as cytokine production and cell-trafficking behavior, that determine which disease type follows infection with FIPV. In addition, the difference between effusive and dry FIP in practice is rather challenging with cats commonly possessing a mixture of the clinical signs typical for the wet or the dry form (Berg et al., 2005, Hartmann, 2005). The severity of the clinical signs, with regard to the magnitude of granulomas and the affected organs is also very diverse. To draw conclusions from immunity studies, with regard to the type of FIP, would demand careful selection of animals, with clinical signs belonging exclusively to the dry or wet type.",

NK cells in FIP cats also showed a higher activation phenotype with higher expression of CD16 and CD25, but this did not translate in higher cytolytic activity, possibly due to virus-induced changes in NK cell biology or activation induced cell death (Fig. 8\n). Similarly, Treg frequencies are significantly reduced in all immunological compartments, while no reduction in numbers could be detected in inflamed tissue. In the mesenteric lymph node, the relative reduction in Treg numbers was even greater than for T and B cells (Fig. 9\n). Additionally, CD8+ and CD4+CD25\u2212 Tregs were also found to be depleted in blood and LN from FIPV cats while elevated CD8+ Treg numbers were observed in inflamed kidneys.
