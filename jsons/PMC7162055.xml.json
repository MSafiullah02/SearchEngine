Episodes of acute asthma in schoolchildren were associated with a respiratory virus infection in 80\u201385% of cases and of viruses detected, 50% were rhinoviruses (RV) [1]. In adult asthma 44% of asthma exacerbations were associated with virus infections \u2013 again the majority were rhinoviruses [2]. In addition to these two studies which were both carried out in the community, time\u2010series analysis was used to investigate more severe asthma exacerbations leading to hospital admissions. Virus infection was again strongly implicated in all age groups [3]. Further studies using sensitive methods of virus detection (PCR) for all the common respiratory virus types are underway in adults both in the community and admitted to hospital \u2013 preliminary results suggest that virus infection is associated with the majority of asthma exacerbations in both settings.",

Furthermore, since frequent episodes of virus\u2010induced lower airways inflammation are likely to lead to enhanced airway wall remodelling and fibrosis, repeated virus\u2010induced asthma exacerbations are likely to be an important contributing factor to the development of irreversible airways narrowing as observed in chronic severe asthma.",

Peaks of allergen exposure can clearly cause exacerbations if the levels of allergen are high enough, as in the cat\u2010allergic subject entering a home with cats, and in the well\u2010publicized epidemics associated with soya bean exposure, or thunderstorm asthma. However, in most exacerbations where no virus is identified, the cause of the exacerbation is not clear. Some clues may have emerged from our recent studies on hospital admissions and asthma mortality. In the mortality study we observed a summer peak in asthma mortality in the 5\u201344 years age group that was unexplained [5]. We hypothesized that this may be related to exposure to fungal allergens, as this has been reported previously in association with near asthma deaths [7]. Interestingly, we observed a similar peak in summer for hospital admissions for asthma in adults aged 16\u201345 years [8], and are currently in the process of analysing the possible role of fungal allergens in this population.",

            "text": "Although high\u2010dose oral steroids are partially effective at treating asthma exacerbations, it is at the expense of major side\u2010effects. Their use in children is undesirable for this reason, and many adults become relatively steroid\u2010resistant as their disease progresses. The use of regular low\u2010dose inhaled steroids for prevention is unfortunately ineffective [9]. There is therefore an urgent need for the development of an effective treatment for virus\u2010induced asthma. Antiviral therapy has been disappointing, as there are major obstacles to the development of effective antiviral therapy, not least, the rapid emergence of resistant strains [10]. An alternative approach to the therapy of virus\u2010induced asthma is to define the factors that lead to the development of an asthma exacerbation in an asthmatic subject in terms of host responses to the viral infection. A non\u2010asthmatic subject undergoing a viral infection will develop principally upper respiratory symptoms, frequently a cough, but little else in the way of lower respiratory symptoms. If the factors leading to the development of lower airways inflammation can be identified, these factors would represent targets for the development of specific therapy aimed at reducing the impact of virus\u2010induced asthma exacerbations. A clear understanding of the mechanisms of virus\u2010induced asthma exacerbations, and the differences from the response of a normal subject to the same infection, will lead to the identification of such targets. Our understanding of both responses is at present very limited.",

RV has an optimum replication temperature of 33 \u00b0C that occurs in the cooler nasal passages. The warmer temperatures (37 \u00b0C) of the lower respiratory tract are considered less conducive to virus replication; it has therefore been argued that RV does not replicate in the lung. However, there is increasing evidence that RV is capable of infecting the lower respiratory tract. We and others have demonstrated replication of RV in human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cell lines in vitro at 37 \u00b0C [11, 12, \u201313], suggesting that the temperature conditions and cell types present in the lower respiratory tract permit RV replication under laboratory conditions. Observations made in our department during bronchoscopy of human volunteers experimentally infected with RV\u201016 revealed marked redness of the throat and trachea with patchy erythema around and beyond the carina, suggesting lower airways infection was likely. RV\u201016 has been detected by RT\u2010PCR in washed bronchoalveolar lavage cell pellets obtained from experimentally infected human volunteers, however, contamination of the samples with RV from the upper airway via the bronchoscope could not be excluded [14].",

Eosinophil major basic protein (MBP) is increased in nasal secretions during RV infection in asthmatic children [19]. In the experimental infection study described above, we observed increased intraepithelial eosinophil numbers in bronchial biopsies during experimental RV infection, interestingly, the eosinophil infiltrate persisted in asthmatic subjects compared to normal subjects [20]. Finally, increased levels of the eosinophil product eo\u2010sinophil cationic protein (ECP) have also been observed in induced sputum in asthmatic subjects undergoing experimental rhinovirus infections [21].

However, there was no difference between normal or asthmatic subjects in the lymphocyte response, suggesting that if lymphocytes are important in differentiating normal from asthmatic responses, then the difference is not likely to be in the number of infiltrating cells, but in the phenotype of the cells. Respiratory virus infections normally promote CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ Tc1 responses with production of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20102 which have antiviral activities via proliferation of natural killer cells. Th2 or Tc2 responses are thought to be important in asthma pathogenesis, acting via production of IL\u20104 promoting isotype switching to IgE production, and IL\u20105 production and the promotion of eosinophilic inflammation. There are clear data to demonstrate that such responses can be produced by viral infections in certain conditions in animal models [22], and that CD8+ T cells may be important in regulating this response [23]. However, there is little data to corroborate these findings in human virus infections\u2013in atopic subjects during RV infections, there is some evidence that a Th2\u2010like response may occur with production of IL\u20105 [24]. The possible role of Th2 and Tc2 responses in virus infections in asthmatic and normal subjects clearly requires further investigation, as does the role of the factors regulating Th and Tc responses.",

We have carried out in vitro studies to demonstrate that RV infection of respiratory epithelial cells induces its own receptor, ICAM\u20101 [25]. ICAM\u20101 is important in the pathogenesis of asthma, and its increased expression by RV infection may play a role in the retention and activation of intraepithelial lymphocytes, and eosinophils. Furthermore, the same studies demonstrated epithelial cell expression of VCAM\u20101, and its upregulation by RV infection via increased activity of members of the GATA transcription factor family [25]. VCAM\u20101 is specifically important in eosinophil infiltration by interacting with its ligand VLA\u20104, and factors regulating its expression may therefore represent targets for therapeutic intervention, however, before firm conclusions about its importance in virus\u2010induced asthma can be drawn, in vivo studies are required to confirm the findings of the in vitro studies.",

For example, RANTES is a potent eosinophil chemo\u2010attractant and activator, and its levels are increased in nasal aspirates from children with virus\u2010induced exacerbations of asthma [26]. RANTES production is increased in RV\u2010infected bronchial epithelial cells in vitro[27], and chemokine receptor expression, and the response of the epithelial cells to chemokine stimulation are also both increased [28]. Local autocrine/paracrine activation of epithelial cells by RV infection, mediated by chemokines, may therefore play a prominent role in virus\u2010induced asthma exacerbations. Once again however, these findings need to be confirmed in vivo, and their relative importance in asthmatic and normal subjects investigated, before chemokines can be put forward as candidate targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the above findings relate to a single chemokine, while there are other new chemokines with potent effects on eosinophil chemoattraction and activation, such as eotaxin and MCP\u20104 [29].",

Recent studies suggest that levels of NO are increased in relation to bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), in response to allergen challenge and are reduced by steroid therapy, suggesting (but not proving) a harmful role for NO in asthma. Recent studies, however, suggest that NO may have a protective role in virus\u2010induced airway hyperresponsiveness. De Gouw et al. [30] have found a relationship between rhinovirus\u2010induced increases in NO levels and protection from increased BHR in experimental rhinovirus infections. Folkerts et al.

We have therefore started to examine the mechanisms of rhinovirus induction of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, in order to determine if there is a common mechanism such as transcription factor activation. We have demonstrated that rhinovirus\u2010induction of IL\u20108 occurs via activation of the transcription factors AP\u20101 and NF\u03baB [32], as does RS virus\u2010induction of IL\u20108 [33], while that of ICAM\u20101 occurs via NF\u03baB alone and that of VCAM\u20101 via NF\u03baB and GATA [25]. Other workers have demonstrated that rhinovirus\u2010induction of IL\u20106 also occurs via induction of NF\u03baB [34]. These in vitro data suggest that inhibition of NF\u03baB might suppress rhinovirus induction of a number of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and therefore reduce the severity of rhinovirus induced asthma exacerbations.
