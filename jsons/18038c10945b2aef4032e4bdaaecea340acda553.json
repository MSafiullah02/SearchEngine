We have identified miRNA hsa-miR-429 41 whose transcription factor was also upregulated and targets were downregulated and this 42 miRNA can have pivotal role in suppression of host immune responses. While searching for 43 the pathways in which viral proteins interact with host proteins, we have found pathways 44 like-HIF-1 signaling, autophagy, RIG-I signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, Fatty acid 45 oxidation/degradation, Il-17 signaling etc significantly associated.

Also, signaling pathways like-Relaxin signaling, 238 Rheumatoid arthritis, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications etc. were also 239 enriched (Figure 2). 240 3.3.

We have identified 18 and 29 such TFs 245 overrepresented around the differentially expressed genes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, 246 respectively (Figure 3, Supplementary figure 3). Among those TFs only 3 (NFKB1A, 247 TNFAIP3, BCL3) were found to be common for deregulated genes of both infections. 19 of 248 29 TFs overrepresented for SARS-CoV-2 deregulated genes were also upregulated upon 249 SARS-CoV-2 infections (Data not shown). 250 3.4.

SARS-CoV-2/host interactions lead to the observed lung related complications in 313 COVID-19 patients 314 COVID-19 patients are reported to have suffer from hypoxic condition due to the breathing 315 complications (Cascella et al., 2020). Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway 316 provides significant support mechanisms during this hypoxic condition by activating a wide 317 ranges of other stress-coping mechanisms and ultimately leads to the survival of the stressed 318 cells (Chen and Sang, 2016). So, if the infected cells utilize this survival mechanism, then the 319 viruses propagating within these will also be saved. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 could be supporting 320 this survival mechanisms as ORF10 protein binds and inhibits E3-ubiquitin ligase complex 321 which degrades HIF-1\u03b1 protein as many viruses modulates this complex for the benefits 322 (Mahon et al., 2014) (Figure 5); it can also stimulate the functions of eIF4E (Eukaryotic 323 Translation Initiation Factor 4E) for over production of HIF-1\u03b1 as similar function was found 324 for sapovirus protein VPg (Montero et al., 2015) (Figure 5). 325 SARS-CoV-2 mediated overexpression of HIF signaling products can lead to the pulmonary 326 hypertension, acute lung injury etc. (Shimoda and Semenza, 2011) which might suggest the 327 reason behind the frequent lung failure of critically infected patients. HIF signaling promotes 328 hypoxia induced endothelial cell proliferations (Krock et al., 2011) which in turn might lead 329 to aberrant clot formation in presence of amplified inflammation (Yau et al., 2015); which is 330 frequently found in many COVID-19 patients. 331 Relaxin signaling plays significant role in maintaining lung's overall functionality by 332 maintaining lung perfusion and gas exchange, relaxation of bronchi and decreased 333 inflammation in lungs (Alexiou et al., 2013). SARS-CoV-2 NSP7 protein can perturb this 334 signaling by binding and inhibiting the relaxin receptors and prevents the productions NOS, 335 MMP2/9 through PI3K to ERK1/2 axis (Figure 15). Another SARS-CoV-2 protein NSP13 336 might bind and block PKA, and its failure to activate NF\u03baB may lead to the blockade of 337 whole relaxin signaling (Figure 15). Aberration of this signaling pathway by SARS-CoV-2 338 possibly leads to the breathing complications in COVID-19 patients. 339 Binding of IL-17 receptor by SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 might increase the downstream signaling 340 by activated TRAF6 to NF\u03baB/MAPKs/CEBPB, which might cause some pathogenic 341 inflammatory responses (Figure 11). Though IL-17 signaling is initially helpful in the host 342 defense, still its aberrant expression might lead to pathogenic inflammatory responses leading 343 to lung complications like-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung fibrosis, 344 pneumonia, acute lung injury etc (Gurczynski and Moore, 2018). 345 3.7.2. SARS-CoV-2 proteins impede autophagy and phagocytosis to ensure its existence 346 During viral infection one important immune response is autophagy which destroys the virus 347 infected cells and viruses are often found to modulate it for their survival (Ahmad et al., 348 2018). SARS-CoV-2 can inhibit the formation of autophagosome and phagosome using 349 several of its proteins (Figure 6, 13A). SARS-CoV-2 NSP15 and NSP7 might bind and 350 inhibit the some small members of Rab, Arf GTPases family (Figure 6) necessary for 351 autophagosome formation (Bento et al., 2013). SARS-CoV-2 NSP7 and ORF8 can inhibit 352 several phagocytosis promoting receptors like-scavenger receptors, integrins (Figure 13A); 353 SARS-CoV-2 NSP6 and M protein might block vATPase, thus preventing the lowering of pH 354inside phagosome and preventing its maturation (Figure 13A); SARS-CoV-2 NSP7 prevents 355 the phagosome-endosome/lysosome fusion by targeting Rab5 GTPase, which might results in 356 virus pneumonia(Jakab et al., 1980) (",

Also, infection induced host miRNAs in \u03b2 2-adrenergic signaling 370 (Figure 9), insulin signaling (Figure 10) can block apoptosis of the infected cell. 371 3.7.4. Host antiviral inflammatory cytokine and interferon production pathways are 372 perturbed by SARS-CoV-2 proteins 373 Cytokine signaling pathways play a major role in suppressing the viral infections (Mogensen 374 and Paludan, 2001). Similar inflammatory cytokine production pathways are also found in 375 human coronaviral infections (Fung and Liu, 2019). We found that SARS-CoV-2 proteins are 376 interacting with the members of these pathways and which might alter the signaling outcomes 377 of these pathways to reduce the overall production of virus infection induced inflammatory 378 cytokines. 379 RIG-I (Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene I) signaling plays important role in producing antiviral 380 inflammatory cytokines and interferons, and induction of apoptosis (Chan and Gack, 2015). 381 SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c protein can activate NLRX1 to degrade MAVS which results in failure 382 of inflammatory cytokine production by NFkB via TRAF2/TAK1 or TRAF6/MEKK1 383 pathways (Figure 7). NLRX1 activity was previously found to be upregulated by HCV 384 infection (Qin et al., 2017). By binding TBK1 and SINTBAD, SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 might 385 inhibit the interferon production by IRF3/IRF7 stimulation (Figure 7). 386 Previous study suggest that RIP1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Kinase 1) signaling plays key 387 role in human coronavirus infection (Meessen-Pinard et al., 2017). RIP1 along with TRADD 388 and TRAF2/5 activate NF\u03baB and MAPKs which then induce the production inflammatory 389 cytokines; this signaling axis might be blocked by SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 protein-RIP1 390 interaction, therefore, inhibiting the antiviral mechanisms exerted by this signaling pathway 391 (Figure 8). SARS-CoV-2 ORF9c can also inhibit ECSIT/TRAF6 signaling axis which plays 392 pivotal antiviral roles by activating NF\u03baB and MAPKs signaling (Lei et al., 2015) (Figure 8). 393 \u03b2 2-adrenergic signaling plays important antiviral roles in respiratory virus infections (A\u011fa\u00e7 et 394 al., 2018). SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 interacts with PKA, which might inhibit the activation of 395 CREB by PKA for producing antiviral inflammatory responses (Figure 9). 396 Previous studies showed that Arachidonic acids suppress the replication of HCoV-229E and 397 MERS-CoV (Yan et al., 2019). 15-oxoETE, an arachidonic acid metabolism product which 398 promotes pulmonary artery endothelial cells proliferation during hypoxia (Ma et al., 2014) 399",

SARS-CoV-2 infection can negatively regulate fatty acid metabolism for its 415 proliferation 416 Host lipid and fatty acid metabolism play crucial role in maintaining the viral life cycle and 417 propagation inside the infected cells as viruses tends to utilize host metabolic pathways for its 418 aids (Mart\u00edn-Acebes et al., 2012). Cui et al. (2019) showed that impairment of fatty acid 419 oxidation can lead to acute lung injury (Cui et al., 2019). SARS-CoV-2 NSP2 can interact 420 with FATP receptor of fatty acid oxidation pathway, wheras M protein can interact and 421 destabilize MCAD of fatty acid oxidation pathway; also, two other proteins were found to be 422 induced human miRNA targets (Figure 10). MCAD deficiency leads to pulmonary 423 haemorrhage and cardiac dysfunction in neonates (Maclean et al., 2005). So, this 424 destabilization might lead to the acute lung injury during COVID-19. Increased fatty acid 425 biosynthetic pathways are found in several viral infections for their efficient multiplications 426 (Mart\u00edn-Acebes et al., 2012), so it is logical for SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit the fatty acid 427 degrading pathways. SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 protein were found to interact with insulin 428 signaling mediated antilipolysis by PKA-HSL signaling axis; SARS-CoV-2 M and several 429 host miRNAs can inhibit fatty acid degradation to CoA through CPT1-CPT2 metabolic axis 430 (Figure 10), so that more fatty acids can be produced. 431 4. Discussion 432 The tug-of-war between the viral pathogens and infected host's response upon the infection is 433 a critical and complex relationship deciding the ultimate fate of an infection. Though most of 434 the time successful removal of the virus is achieved through host immune response, still 435 viruses have also evolved some immune evasion mechanisms to escape the immune 436 surveillance of the host, thus, making the outcomes of the disease more complicated (Fung et 437 al., 2020). Similar interactions were also found in other human coronaviruses which 438 modulates the host immune responses (Fung and Liu, 2019; Fung et al., 2020). In this study, 439 we have depicted how SARS-CoV-2 and host protein interactome leads to the probable 440 immune escape mechanisms of this novel virus, along with the functional roles of other host 441 epigenetic factors in this interaction as host epigenetic factors serve important roles in viral 442 infections (Bussfeld et al., 1997; Paschos and Allday, 2010; Girardi et al., 2018). 443 Our analysis showed several transcription factors are capable of binding around the 444 promoters of deregulated genes found in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which were absent in 445 SARS-CoV infection. Some of these downregulated transcription factors in SARS-CoV-2 446 infection like-MAF, FOXO1 can elicit proviral responses (Kim and Seed, 2010; Lei et al., 447 2013). Also, some upregulated transcription factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection like-HDAC7 448 (Herbein and Wendling, 2010), STAT2 (Le-Trilling et al., 2018), ATF4 (Caselli et al., 2012), 449 FOSL1 (Cai et al., 2017) can facilitate progression of viral life cycle and immune evasion in 450 host. Though other upregulated transcription factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection TRIM25 451 (Mart\u00edn-Vicente et al., 2017), SMAD3 (Qing et al., 2004), STAT1, IRF7, and IRF9 (Chiang 452 and Liu, 2019) might play a role in the antiviral immunity upon infection. 453 Interestingly, we have found 2 miRNAs-hsa-miR-429 and hsa-miR-1286 whose associated 454 transcription factors were upregulated and their target genes were downregulated, suggesting 455 they might have some roles in this host-virus interactions. In RSV infection, hsa-miR-429 456 was found to be upregulated in severe disease conditions (Inchley et al., 2015). Other studies 457 showed that this miRNA plays important role in promoting viral replication and reactivation 458 from latency (Ellis-Connell et al., 2010; Bernier and Sagan, 2018). So, expression of this 459 miRNA in SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to similar disease outcomes. 460 Upregulated epigenetic factors in SARS-CoV-2 infections can be both a boon and a bane for 461 the host, as factors like-TRIM16 (van Tol et al., 2017), DTX3L (Zhang et al., 2015) can 462 provide antiviral responses; whereas factors like-PRDM1 (also known as BLIMP-1) (Lu et 463 al., 2014), HDAC7 (Herbein and Wendling, 2010) can act as proviral factors. 464 Upregulated transcription factors like-SMAD3, MYC, NFKB1, STAT1 might be involved in 465 the upregulation of hsa-miR-18a, hsa-miR-155, hsa-miR-210, hsa-miR-429, hsa-miR-433 466 which can in turn downregulate the HIF-1 production (Supplementary Figure 4) (Serocki et 467 al., 2018). Also, epigenetic factors like PRMT1 can downregulate HIF-1 expression; while 468 factors like HDAC7 can increase the transcription of HIF-1 (Luo and Wang, 2018). We found 469 that when MYC, SMAD3, TNF transcription factors are upregulated, they can activate 470 autophagy and apoptosis promoting miRNAs like-hsa-miR-17, hsa-miR-20, hsa-miR-106 471 (Supplementary Figure 4) (Xu et al., 2012). RIG-I signaling can induce miRNAs like-hsa-472 miR-24, hsa-miR-32, hsa-miR-125, hsa-miR-150 to neutralize viral threats (Li and Shi, 2013) 473 and we also found these miRNAs can be transcribed by the upregulated TFs (Supplementary 474 Figure 4). RIP1 can be targeted by induced hsa-miR-24 and hsa-miR-155 (Liu et al., 2011; 475 Tan et al., 2018) in SARS-CoV-2 infection (Supplementary Figure 4). IL-17F can be targeted 476 by upregulated hsa-miR-106a, hsa-miR-17, and hsa-miR-20a, while expression IL-17A can 477 be modulated by upregulated hsa-miR-146a, and hsa-miR-30c (Supplementary Figure 4) 478 (Mai et al., 2012). We also found that different upregulated TFs induced miRNAs like-hsa-479 miR-146a, hsa-miR-155 can downregulate TLR4 signaling (Supplementary Figure 4) (Yang 480 et al., 2011). 481",
