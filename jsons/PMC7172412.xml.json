All these organisms in a healthy intestinal tract live in a natural balance called symbiosis. There are more than 2000 species of commensal bacterial organisms within our bodies, the vast majority in the gut.1 In fact the mammalian gut is considered one of the most densely populated ecosystems on Earth with a bacterial load in the region of 1012 organisms/g of fecal material in the large intestine.2 The several species of microorganisms in the adult human gut are known as the microbiota which may contain nearly 100 times the number of genes contained within the human genome. The genome of these collective organisms is called the microbiome. The longitudinal distribution of intestinal microorganisms increases in density progressing from the small bowel to colon (Fig. 2\n). Anaerobic bacteria benefit the host by performing metabolic functions including fermentation, providing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), producing vitamins, adding to the trophic action of the epithelium and aiding in the development of the immune system.3\n",

Following birth, oral and cutaneous bacteria from the mother will be mechanically transferred to the infant by suckling, kissing and caressing. Moreover the Authors observed that breast feeding exposes the infant to bacteria, especially bifidobacteria, from milk ducts, nipple, and surrounding skin. Breast milk contains antimicrobial components and growth factors that stimulate the development and maturation of the intestinal mucosa. The Authors conclude that the development of infantile intestinal microbiota involves the initial vaginal exposure, transmission during neonatal care, subsequent breast feeding and finally, after the introduction of solid food, the bacterial profiles of breast and formula fed infants become similar to that of adults by the 1\u20132 years of life (conversion to adult microbiota).",

            "text": "The GI tract bacteria are all essential for its normal physiology but they are also potentially pathogenic. Dysbiosis occurs when the GI bacterial microflora ecology equilibrium is altered leading to an imbalance that can involve metabolic or immunologic feedback of the host. Round et al.10 describe a healthy microbiota as a balanced composition of many classes of bacteria such as symbionts (organisms with known health promoting functions), commensals (permanent residents which provide no benefit or detriment to the host) and pathobionts (permanent residents of the microbiota with the potential to induce pathology). The Authors underline that, in conditions of dysbiosis, there is an unnatural shift in the composition of the microbiota, which results in either a reduction in the numbers of symbionts and/or an increase in the numbers of pathobionts (Fig. 3\n). This condition can lead to mild subjective discomfort and even disease condition (e.g., dysbiosis can lead to non-specific inflammation which may predispose certain genetically susceptible people to inflammatory disease). The good balance of GI tract microflora is responsible for a lot of functions within the body such as vitamin production, hormonal activities, immunity and detoxification processes. In case of bacterial imbalance a release of toxic metabolic products is induced, followed by flatulence, bloating, intestinal pain and inflammation, cramping and constipation and/or diarrhea. It is important that a correct dysbiosis diagnosis is made because the only treatment of the symptoms will not lead to the solving of the real problem and will bring the patient to develop other diseases. In fact, intestinal dysbiosis should be considered as a possible cause, or a contributing factor in patients who have asthma, bronchitis, allergies, autoimmune disorders, breast and colon cancer, unexplained fatigue or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Systemic effects such as halitosis, adrenal stress, diarrhea, candida, leaky gut syndrome, colon cancer and breast cancer can be considered a consequence of dysbiosis. Possible factors which can contribute to dysbiosis are: host genetics, lifestyle, exposure to microorganisms and medical practices, diet and stress. Birth in the sterile environment of hospitals can protect from exposure to dangerous pathogens, but can also prevent early exposure to health promoting bacteria. Overuse of vaccination and antibiotics, which do not distinguish between pathogenic or symbiotic microorganisms, could adversely alter the microbiota.10 Many chronic and degenerative diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis are considered today to be linked to abnormalities in the bacteria microflora ecology (Fig. 4).",

            "text": "The term probiotic derives from the Greek/Latin word \u201cpro\u201d and the Greek word \u201cbios\u201d, meaning for life. The concept of probiotic was probably firstly introduced by the Russian Nobel laureate Elie Metchnikoff in 1907 (\u201cThe Prolongation of Life: Optimistic Studies\u201d) where he proposed the idea that ingesting microbes could have beneficial effects for human beings, especially to treat digestive diseases\u201d.11 The term \u201cprobiotic\u201d was firstly used in 1965, by Lilly and Stillwell, to describe substances secreted by one organism which stimulates the growth of another. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations have defined probiotics as \u201clive microorganisms, which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.\u201d Probiotics consist of bacteria or yeasts and can be considered functional foods that can re-colonize and restore the microflora symbiosis of the intestinal tract. Most probiotics are bacteria similar to those naturally found in people\u2019s guts, especially in those of breastfed infants because they are known to have natural protection against many diseases. Most often, the bacteria come from two groups, Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium. Each group involves different species (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidus etc.) which include different strains. Some common probiotics, such as Saccharomyces boulardii, are yeasts. Some examples of bacteria used in probiotics formulations are Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus sporogenes, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacteria longum, Bifidobacteria infantis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Homeostatic Soil Organisms (HSO\u2019s). A good probiotic must possess the following requirements: 1) being able to adhere to cells; 2) excluding or reducing pathogenic adherence; 3) being able to persist, multiply and produce acids, hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins antagonistic to pathogen growth; 4) being able to be safe, noninvasive, noncarcinogenic and non-pathogenic; 5) being able to coaggregate as to form a normal balanced flora.12 For an adequate amount of health benefits, a dose of 5 billion colony-forming unit (CFU) has been recommended for at least 5 days (5 \u00d7 109 CFU/day).13 Probiotics are available in food and dietary supplements (for example, capsules, tablets and powders) and in some other forms as well. In probiotic foods and supplements, the bacteria may have been present originally or added during preparation. Probiotics must survive gastric and bile acids in order to reach the intestinal tract, colonize the host epithelium, and exhibit a beneficial effect. Most conventional forms of lactobacilli-type probiotics are nonspore forming and, therefore, are inactivated by bile and low gastric pH. In addition, probiotics selected for commercial use must survive industrial manufacturing and storage to ensure long-term viability and activity. Most cells of conventional lactobacilli die at 70 \u00b0C, while spore-bearing lactic acid-forming bacteria do not show a decrease in viable cells even after heating in saline at 85 \u00b0C for 30 min. Therefore the survival of probiotics through the GI tract is strongly affected by stomach acidity, the length of exposure to acid, the concentration of and length of exposure to bile salts and the level of bile salt hydrolase activity. Probiotics must not be confused with prebiotics, nondigestible food ingredients that selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial microorganisms already present in people\u2019s colons. The term prebiotic was first introduced by Gibson and Roberfroid in 1995 and is defined as \u201ca nondigestible food ingredient that beneficially affects the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacteria in the colon, and thus improves host health\u201d.11 When probiotics and prebiotics are mixed together, they form a synbiotic. A synbiotic is a supplement that contains both a prebiotic and a probiotic that work together to keep healthy the bacterial microflora of the human intestine. Fermented milks (yogurt and kefir) are considered to be true synbiotic products, that is, functional foods, since they contribute to restore the normal bacterial microflora also supplying the food it needs to survive. However not all these products promote symbiosis. The best synbiotic combinations currently available include bifidobacteria and fructooligosaccharides (FOS), Lactobacillus GG and inulins, and bifidobacteria and lactobacilli with FOS or inulins.",

            "text": "The word probiotics refers to microorganisms that are able to confer health benefits on humans and that have been industrially prepared for nutritional and pharmaceutical use. The consumption of these products is growing very fast all over the world and probiotics are generally considered generally regarded as safe (GRAS).13 Indu et al.12 suggest that probiotics are responsible for competitive exclusion of enteric pathogens from the gut lumen. The putative inhibitory mechanism should be the production of lactic acid and bacteriocins. Moreover they restore the normal intestinal flora during an antibiotic therapy, trigger cytokines synthesis from enterocytes attaching to their surfaces, produce toxic metabolites like hydrogen peroxide and synthesize butyric acid which increases the turnover of enterocytes and neutralizes dietary carcinogens. Probiotics exert several immunomodulatory functions acting on cellular and humoral responses. Furthermore they can stimulate Type 1 Helper T Cells (L. Casei), mononuclear cells leading to increased clearance of circulating pathogenic bacteria (L. Acidophilus), macrophages to produce TNF-alpha, IL-6 and NO production, increase clearance of circulating pathogenic bacteria by Kupffer Cells and they can produce antirotaviral IgA and antinfluenza IgG antibodies (B. Breve). Snydman28 reports three theoretical concerns regarding the safety of probiotics: firstly the occurrence of disease, due to bacteremia, sepsis or endocarditis, secondly the toxic or metabolic effects on the GI tract and thirdly the transfer of antibiotic resistance in the GI flora. The Author underlines that, although there are rare cases of bacteremia or fungemia related to the use of saprophytic probiotics, epidemiologic evidence through clinical trials and epidemiologic survey suggests that they can be safely used. Wassenaar et al.29 highlight that bacteria used for probiotics formulation should be completely safe although there could be some flaws: 1) sometimes virulence factors have been detected in probiotic bacterial strains; 2) horizontal gene transfer can result in acquisition of virulence genes or antimicrobial resistance in probiotic bacteria; 3) antimicrobial resistance in these bacteria can possibly aid the spread of unwanted resistance in endogenous bacterial populations. Liong et al.30 observe that some bacteria strains, commonly used in probiotic formulations, such as Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Enterococcus, and Bifidobacterium have been isolated from infection sites, leading to the problem that these probiotics can translocate. The Authors underlined that probiotics translocation hardly occurs in healthy humans (where it happens, detrimental effects are rare) but health-damaging effects of probiotics translocation can occur in immunocompromised patients. In these people probiotics might theoretically cause infections that need to be treated with antibiotics but, unfortunately, the antibiotic resistance of some strains has increased the complexity of their eradication. Surely further investigations are required to analyze the mechanisms of probiotic translocation and infection. Safety assessments should be focused on these mechanisms so that the negative effects of probiotics do not outweigh the benefits.",

            "text": "Lammers et al.31 studied mucosal gene expression of the pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin(IL)-1beta, IL-6), TH1 cytokines (interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), TNF-alpha, IL-12), regulatory cytokines (IL-10, transforming growth factor-beta), and the chemokine IL-8. In addition to assess the cytokines gene expression, the presence of polymorphonuclear cells in the mucosal tissue was evaluated. Patients who were treated with probiotics had significant lower mucosal mRNA expression levels of IL-1beta, IL-8, and IFN-gamma compared with placebo-treated patients. A lower number of polymorphonuclear cells was present in the tissue of patients within the probiotic group compared with the number of polymorphonuclear cells in the tissue of patients receiving placebo and patients having an episode of pouchitis. This study highlights that probiotic treatment is able to regulate the mucosal immune response reducing mucosal levels of neutrophil-chemoattractant IL-8 and tissue influx of polymorphonuclear cells, and may further act by inhibit T cells activation, reinforce the barrier function and keep a tight control of the potent proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta. A randomized double-blind study was designed by Marchan et al.32 Probiotic bacteria or placebo were administered for 1 month before delivery to mothers and for 6 months to infants with a family history of allergy. Plasma samples were analyzed for C-reactive protein (CRP), total IgA and IgE, food-specific IgA, IgG, and IgE, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma. The association of CRP with a decreased risk of eczema at 2 years of age in allergy-prone children supports the idea that chronic, low-grade inflammation protects from eczema. Low-grade inflammation induced by probiotics was characterized by elevation of IgE, IgA, and IL-10, a change typically observed in helminth infection associated induction of regulatory mechanisms. This study emphasizes the role of chronic microbial exposure as an immune modulator protecting from allergy. Stadbauer et al.33 in an open-label study involving 12 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) (6.5 \u00d7 109) 3 times daily for 4 weeks), 13 healthy controls and 8 cirrhotic patients who did not receive probiotics, report that probiotics restore neutrophil phagocytic capacity in cirrhosis, possibly by changing IL-10 secretion and TLR4 expression, warranting larger randomized controlled and mechanistic studies. Kekkonen et al.34 evaluated the effect of stimulation provided by several probiotic bacterial strains (Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Propionibacterium) on cytokines production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The probiotic S. thermophilus and Leuconostoc strains were shown to be more potent inducers of Th1 type cytokines IL-12 and IFN-gamma than the probiotic Lactobacillus strains and the use of bacterial combinations did not result in enhanced cytokine production. The first study to investigate the effects of probiotics intervention on global lipidomic profiles in humans was designed by Kekkonen et al.35 The study investigated the effect of three weeks\u2019 intervention with Lactobacillus rhamnosus on global serum lipidomic profiles and evaluated whether the changes in inflammatory variables (CRP, TNF-alpha and IL-6) are reflected in the global lipidomic profiles of healthy adults. The Authors observed that probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus intervention may lead to changes in serum global lipid profiles, as reflected in decreased glycerophosphatidylcholines (GPCho), lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoGPCho) and sphingomyelins (SM) and in the increasing of triacylglycerols (TAGs). Among the inflammatory variables, IL-6 was moderately associated with changes in global lipidomic profiles, with the top-ranked lipid associated with IL-6 which is the proinflammatory LysoGPCho (20:4). There was a weak association between the lipidomic profiles and the two other inflammatory markers, TNF-alpha and CRP25. Takeda et al.36 in a placebo-controlled crossover trial, observed the effect of LcS on natural killer (NK) cell activity in humans. NK cell activity exhibited a declining trend during the period of placebo ingestion, but NK cell activity increased after intaking fermented milk containing 4 \u00d7 1010 live LcS for 3 weeks. When human PBMC were cultured in the presence of heat-killed LcS, NK cell activity was enhanced. The ability of LcS to enhance NK cell activity and induce IL-12 production was correlated, and the addition of anti-IL-12 monoclonal antibody reduced the enhancement of NK cell activity triggered by LcS. In addition, the separation of NK cells from LcS-stimulated monocytes with membrane filter reduced NK cell activity to the intermediate level and almost deprived monocytes of the ability to produce IL-12. The Authors demonstrated that LcS can enhance NK cell activity in vivo and in vitro in humans, and IL-12 may be responsible for enhancement of NK cell activity triggered by LcS.",

The Authors observed that volunteers, treated with LcS, showed a significant reduction in levels of antigen-induced IL-5, IL-6 and IFN-gamma production compared with volunteers supplemented with placebo.

            "text": "The skin is able to act as a physical barrier exerting several functions such as fluid homeostasis, thermoregulation, immunologic functions, neurosensory functions, metabolic functions and primary protection against infection. In case of thermal injury the burn can be colonized by several types of pathogens, i.e. primarily gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), gram-negative bacteria such as Acinetobacter baumannii\u2013calcoaceticus complex, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella species and fungal pathogens. The prevention of infection include early burn-eschar excision, topical and prophylactic antibiotics, and aggressive infection-control measures. The antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from patients with burns has increased and bacterial colonization and infection remain the major causes of delayed healing and graft rejection following burns. Topical treatment is necessary to reduce the incidence of burn wound infection. The ability of the probiotic organism Lactobacillus plantarum to inhibit the pathogenic activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, both in vitro and in vivo, was tested by Vald\u00e9z et al.39 In vitro (Lactobacillus plantarum whole cultures, culture filtrates acid filtrate and neutralised acid filtrate) and isolated, washed cells were tested for their effects on the production of the P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing signal molecules, acyl-homoserine-lactones (AHLs), and two virulence factors controlled by signal molecules such as elastase and biofilm. All were inhibited by L. plantarum cultures and filtrates, but not by isolated, washed cells. The acid L. plantarum growth medium itself had some inhibitory activity but the greatest activity was exerted by the whole culture. In vivo (a burned-mouse model was used) burns infected with P. aeruginosa were treated with L. plantarum at 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 days post-infection. Samples from skin, liver and spleen taken after 5, 10 and 15 days demonstrated that L. plantarum had inhibited P. aeruginosa colonization. There was also an improvement in tissue repair, enhanced phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa produced by tissue phagocytes and a decrease in apoptosis at 10 days. The Authors conclude that L. plantarum and/or its by-products are potential therapeutic agents for the local treatment of P. aeruginosa burn infections.",

Probiotic treatment reduced eczema (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55\u20130.98; P = 0.035) and atopic eczema (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46\u20130.95; P = 0.025). Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria more frequently (P < 0.001) colonized the guts of supplemented infants. Probiotic treatment showed no effect on the incidence of all allergic diseases for infants aged 2 but significantly prevented eczema and especially atopic eczema. The Authors observed an inverse association between atopic diseases and colonization of the gut through probiotics and concluded that the prevention of atopic eczema in high-risk infants is possible modulating the infants\u2019 gut microbiota with probiotics and prebiotics.",

            "text": "Postoperative complications in GI surgery could involve bacteremia and infectious complications. The main causes could be the translocation of the GI bacteria or its toxins as a consequence of bacterial overgrowth, the loss of intestinal epithelial integrity and the immunologic compromising of the host. Probiotics could be good candidate to fight against these factors through the competition with potential pathogens for nutrients or enterocyte adhesion sites, degradation of toxins, production of antimicrobial factors, and local and systemic immunomodulation. The aim of this short paragraph is to report some important clinical trials which could help to evaluate the usefulness of probiotics action to ease the complication rate in patients undergoing surgery on the GI tract. Some of the main important procedures which have been related to the use of probiotics are: first the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) which involves the removal of the entire colon and rectum, with preservation of the anus and sphincter muscles and is performed to avoid a permanent stoma (opening for collecting waste) in cases where the entire colon and rectum need to be removed usually in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis or pathologies associated with colon cancers; second the pancreaticoduodectomy to treat tumors of the pancreatic head, neck or uncinate process; third the surgical resection for patients with localized tumors affecting the pancreas. Falk et al.47 analyzed the possible role of probiotics for the treatment of pouchitis which is the inflammation of the ileal reservoir and the major complication of IPAA following proctocolectomi for ulcerative colitis (UC). This review reported that patients with pouchitis have an increased number of anaerobes and aerobes, less bifidobacteria and anaerobic lactobacilli and more clostridia than patients not affected by that condition. The Authors reported a double-blind study (40 patients with chronic pouchitis treated with VSL#3, a probiotic bacterial mix containing 4 lactobacilli strains, three bifidobacteria strains and one streptococcus strain) showing that probiotics can prevent relapse of pouchitis. Another study combining Lactobacillus rhamnosus with FOS confirmed the possible use of probiotic formulations to induce remission in this condition.",

Recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) is, in most cases caused by the uropathogens E. Coli; recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV) is usually caused by Gardnerella vaginalis; recurrent yeast vaginosis is usually caused by Candida albicans. The predominant bacteria in the urinary tract of healthy women are lactobacilli. Infections are usually treated using antibiotics with the effect of decreasing the number of lactobacilli which cause GI symptoms, raise drug resistance and do not restore the urinary tract natural barrier to infections. Zuccotti et al.43 reported some studies highlighting that probiotics could be a good alternative to antibiotic therapy due to their quality to adhere to uroepithelial cells and produce inhibitors of pathogenic growth and biosurfactant secretion. The same Authors reported that oral lactobacilli-based therapy under viable conditions showed that these bacteria are able to colonize the urinary tract after enteral colonization. Reid et al.55 reported that a daily intake of probiotic strains L. rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14, resulted in some asymptomatic BV patients reverting to a normal lactobacilli dominated vaginal microflora. The same Authors reported other two studies regarding BV: firstly a twice daily use of hydrogen peroxide producing 108 L. acidophilus in a product called Vivag for six days led to a 43% improvement compared to none at all in the placebo group; secondly yogurt containing L. acidophilus, delivered in a tampon to pregnant women, showed to treat BV and prevented infection at 2 months follow-up. Reid et al.55 also reported a study which indicates that the recurrence of UTI can be reduced using one or two capsules (L. Rhamnosus GR-1 and L. Fermentum B-54, replaced more recently by RC-14, freeze dried and placed in gelatine capsules, with dosage at 109 per capsule) vaginally per week for one year, with no side effects or yeast infections. The Authors also explored the use of probiotics for the treatment of yeast vaginitis reporting that L. Rhamnosus GR-1 and L. Fermentum RC-14 are able to kill and inhibit the adhesion of yeast to vaginal cells. Moreover they reported a crossover study involving 33 patients with recurrent vaginitis treated with eight ounces of L. Acidophilus supplemented yogurt daily for six months and then switched to a yogurt free diet. The therapy resulted in 0.4 breakthrough infections compared with 2.5 per study term.",

Thirty consecutive patients (19 males, 11 females, mean age 60.1 years, range 47\u201375 years) affected by uncomplicated diverticulitis of the colon were monitored. After obtaining remission, the patients were randomly assigned to one of the following groups as follows: group A, balsalazide 2.25 g daily for 10 days every month plus VSL#3 450 billions/day for 15 days every month and group B, VSL#3 alone 450 billions/day for 15 days every month.

            "text": "In Europe and North America IBS is estimated to have an incidence of 10\u201315%. In Sweden, the most commonly cited figure is 13.5%. The prevalence of IBS is increasing in countries in the Asia\u2013Pacific region, particularly in countries with developing economies. IBS mainly occurs between the ages of 15 and 65. The estimated prevalence of IBS in children is similar to that in adults.67 IBS is a common disorder of the intestines associated with cramping, stomach pain, gas, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. IBS can be characterized by constipation, diarrhea or both. Diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) is characterized by an increased intestinal permeability accompanied by persistent low-grade immune activation in the gut presented as increased numbers of T lymphocytes, mast cells and enterochromaffin cells. In its normal condition, gut epithelial lining forms a relatively impermeable barrier between luminal contents and submucosa required for intestinal homeostasis. This barrier is determined by complexes of proteins composing the junctional complexes. Tight junctions (TJs) are the most apical organelle of the epithelial junctional complexes and are crucial for the formation and function of epithelial barriers. TJs comprise numerous proteins, with the best characterized being zonula occludens (ZO)-1 and occludin.68 The diarrhea form is the predominant form and brings the patient to experience abdominal pain, visible abdominal distension (bloating), bowel frequency particularly in association with pain, pain relieved by bowel action, rectal passage of mucous and sensation of incomplete evacuation. Spastic colon syndrome is an IBS variant which is mainly characterized by constipation. The constipation IBS variant let the patient experience the same symptoms except for the bowel frequency which is replaced by the constipation which is responsible for the pain. IBS seems to be due to a dysfunction of the muscles of the organs of the GI tract or the nerves controlling the organs. Nerves run for the entire length of the GI tract from the esophagus to the anus in the muscular walls of the organs reaching also the spinal cord and the brain. IBS is thought to result from an interplay of abnormal GI tract movements, increased awareness of normal bodily functions, and a change in of the nervous system communication between the brain and the GI tract. Although the causes of IBS are not yet known some factors are usually associated to this condition: genetic influences, food intake, endocrine imbalances, malabsorption, post-operative changes, altered GI motility, heightened sensory function of the intestine, or malfermentation of food residues and psychosomatic factors such as a psychological morbidity, stress and an abnormal illness behaviour.69 IBS has a great negative impact on the patient\u2019s emotional health and quality of life especially for those who are facing this disease for their entire life. Symptoms can be alleviated by the patient's education, reassurance, and dietary modification but they are not a definitive resolution.68 Before considering the most recent clinical trials for the treatment of IBS it is worth to remember some important studies faced before. In 1998 Vanderhoof et al.70 reported a study developed in Poland using L. Plantarum 299 (LP299V). This bacterium is able to synthetize nitric oxide, an important mediator of gut motility, it may displace the attachment of other organisms from the intestinal mucosa and it seems to be able to reduce any inflammatory component associated with IBS. The study results showed a reduction of symptoms of abdominal pain and constipation when compared with placebo. The same Author71 reported another study to support the beneficial effect of LP299V. This small double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover study in children with recalcitrant chronic, recurrent abdominal pain of childhood showed a significant reduction in the severity of abdominal pain in LP299V-treated patients compared with results in control subjects. Tsuchiya et al. realized a study to evaluate the efficacy of a symbiotic containing bifidobacteria (4.95 \u00d7 109/100 ml) for the treatment of IBS. The Authors found that, after a 12 weeks treatment on 68 patients, the symbiotic was able to significantly reduce the intensity of the symptoms of IBS. O\u2019Mahony et al.72 realized a study to compare the response of symptoms and cytokine ratios in IBS with ingestion of probiotic preparations containing a lactobacillus or bifidobacterium strain. Seventy-seven subjects with IBS were randomized to receive either Lactobacillus salivarius UCC4331 or Bifidobacterium infantis 35624, each in a dose of 1 \u00d7 1010 live bacterial cells in a malted milk drink or the malted milk drink alone as placebo for 8 weeks. B. infantis 35624 alleviates symptoms in IBS; this symptomatic response was associated with normalization of the ratio of an anti-inflammatory to a proinflammatory cytokine, suggesting an immune-modulating role for this organism in this disorder. Furrie et al.73 designed a study based on the use of a symbiotic containing bifidobacteria to treat IBS. The symbiotic was successful in treating the pathology without evident adverse events and modulate the immunological parameters of the same. The treatment based on bifidobacteria and FOS improves the intestinal habits and the quality of patients\u2019 life.",

Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 (Ganeden Biotech, Inc., Mayfield Heights, OH) is a patented strain of lactic acid producing bacteria that can sustain the low ph of stomach acid and become active in the intestine. Strains of B coagulans produce coagulin, which is a heat-stable, protease-sensitive, bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance with activity against gram-positive bacteria. Spores of Bacillus are resistant to heat and hostile GI conditions and, therefore, are able to reach the intestine where they can germinate and proliferate within the host. B coagulans GBI-30, 6086 maintains spore viability after 5 years of storage without the need for refrigeration (unpublished communication, Ganeden Biotech, Inc., Mayfield Heights, OH), making it particularly suitable for commercial use. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial involved 44 subjects who received either placebo or B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 once a day for 8 weeks. Self-assessments of the severity of IBS symptoms (abdominal pain and bloating) were recorded every day for 8 weeks. Because baseline values were significantly different between the 2 study groups, within-group analysis was conducted. All subjects met the Rome II Criteria for IBS with diarrhea, i.e. they must have had, during the 12 months prior to evaluation, and for a total of at least 12 weeks (not necessarily consecutively), abdominal discomfort or pain that had 2 of 3 features: relief with defecation, onset associated with a change in frequency of stool and onset associated with a change in appearance of stool. Individuals with any organic GI conditions or diseases, previous intestinal surgery, immunodeficiency, or lactose intolerance, or who were pregnant or lactating, were excluded from the study. Patients who had taken commercially available probiotic medications within 30 days of the study were also excluded. The Authors obtained as results the improvements from baseline abdominal pain and bloating scores in the B coagulans GBI-30, 6086 group which were statistically significant for all 7 weekly comparisons (P < 0.01); in the placebo group, only changes in abdominal pain scores at 6 and 8 weeks achieved statistical significance (P < 0.05); no treatment-related adverse events or serious adverse events were reported during the 8-week study period. The Authors, basing on the previous described results, suggest that the patented B coagulans GBI-30, 6086 probiotic might be a safe and effective option for the relief of abdominal pain and bloating for patients with IBS. These results justify the design of larger scale, controlled clinical trials to verify these findings.",

The patients consumed 15 g lactulose, made up to a 100 mL solution with water. Breath hydrogen samples were collected at baseline and every 15 min for at least 2 h. The Authors recruited 18 patients with IBS (Rome II criteria), who showed an early rise in breath hydrogen with lactulose (ERBHAL: defined as a rise of breath hydrogen of 10 ppm or greater above the baseline breath hydrogen on two consecutive 15-min samples, before 90 min following the ingestion of lactulose. The time of the first rise in breath hydrogen of 10 ppm or more was recorded). They consumed 65 mL of Yakult daily for 6 wks. Lactulose breath test was repeated at the end of the treatment period. Symptoms were recorded daily using a 10 cm visual analogue scale. Fourteen patients completed the study, 9 (64%) had reversal of ERBHAL, with the median time of first rise in breath hydrogen increasing from 45 to 75 min (P = 0.03). There was no significant improvement in the symptoms score with probiotic therapy, except for wind (P = 0.04). Patients commencing with at least moderate symptoms and who no longer had ERBHAL at the end of treatment, showed improvement in the overall symptoms scores [median final score 5.3 (IQR 3.9\u20135.9), 55% reduction; n = 6] to a greater extent than those who had had persisting ERBHAL [final score 6.9 (5.0\u20137.0), 12% reduction; n = 5; P = 0.18]. This study shows that Yakult is effective in altering fermentation patterns in the small bowel, consistent in reducing SIBO. The loss of ERBHAL was associated with reduced symptoms.

Patients were randomized to a prebiotic (n = 135), or a symbiotic formulation containing Lactobacillus paracasei\nB21060 (Flortec, n = 132). Primary efficacy was the responder rate for pain and global relief of symptoms in the overall population and in patients with predominant diarrhea (n = 47). Post hoc time-trend analyses for changes within each treatment were carried out. The following results were obtained: patients with absent/mild pain amounted to 54.7% in the symbiotic group and to 57.4% in the prebiotic group at treatment week 4, and to 53.9% and 53.4% at the end of treatment; patients with amelioration of well-being were, respectively, 60.7% versus 61.7% at treatment week 4, and 63.3% versus 60.9% at the end of treatment; within each treatment group, patients with absent/mild pain increased in the Flortec and the prebiotic group, but time trend analyses were significant only for Flortec (P = 0.019); in D-IBS, Flortec significantly reduced bowel movements, pain, and IBS scores. The Authors concluded that: Flortec is encouraging in patients with D-IBS and is able to improve the pain and the patient\u2019s well-being even if in the future Flortec has to be compared with an inert placebo to establish its efficacy for the majority of IBS patients.",

Patients were given either a probiotic fermented milk (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium Longum) or milk beverage containing no bacteria. The clinical symptoms were scored and intestinal permeability measured by a triple sugar test before and after treatment. Small bowel permeability was measured as the ratio of L/M recovery and colonic permeability was measured as the total mass of sucralose excretion (mg). After probiotics treatment, small bowel permeability decreased significantly from 0.038 at baseline to 0.023 (P = 0.004), the proportion of patients with increased small bowel permeability was lower than that one at baseline (28.6% vs. 64.3%, P = 0.023). However, colonic permeability improved neither in the probiotics group nor in the placebo group at week 4. Treatment with probiotics significantly decreased the mean global IBS scores compared with the baseline scores (9.62 \u00b1 1.05 vs. 7.64 \u00b1 1.24, P < 0.001).

The test product was a fermented milk (Activia, Danone), containing B. animalis DN-173, 010 (1.25 \u00d7 1010 CFU per pot) together with the two classical yogurt starters, S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus (1.2 \u00b7 109 cfu \u2044 pot). The control product was heat-treated yogurt containing non-living bacteria (<104 cfu/pot). Both the test and control products were without flavour, and had a similar appearance, colour, texture and taste. Each serving, corresponding to one pot, contained 125 g. Both products were specifically prepared for the study and provided by Danone Research (Palaiseau, France). A total of 274 primary care adults with constipation-predominant IBS (Rome II) were randomized to consume for 6 weeks either the test fermented milk or a heat-treated yogurt (control). HRQoL and digestive symptoms were assessed after 3 and 6 weeks on an intention-to-treat population of 267 subjects. The previously described results brought the Authors to the following results: the HRQoL discomfort score, the primary endpoint, was improved (P < 0.001) in both groups at weeks 3 and 6; the responder rate for the HRQoL discomfort score was higher (65.2 vs. 47.7%, P < 0.005), as it was higher the decrease in bloating score (0.56 \u00b1 (s.d.) 1.01 vs. 0.31 \u00b1 0.87, P = 0.03), at week 3 in the test vs. the control group. In those subjects with <3 stools/week, stool frequency increased (P < 0.001) over 6 weeks in the test vs. control group.

In conclusion, the present large-scale study strongly suggests a beneficial effect of a probiotic food containing B. animalis DN-173010 on HRQoL discomfort score and bloating, and also on stool frequency in those subjects with <3 stools per week. Further studies aiming at confirming the results obtained and to elucidate mechanisms of such effects should be of special interest for providing additional scientific evidence to support the use of such probiotic food to alleviate IBS symptoms and improve HRQoL discomfort.",

The World Gastroenterology Organization reports that: UC incidence has been increasing in Western countries since the Second World War and in low-incidence areas in eastern Europe, Asia and developing countries; CD incidence is <1 per 100,000 in Asia and South America, 1\u20133 per 100,000 in southern Europe, South Africa, 16 per 100,000 in New Zealand and Australia, 14 per 100,000 in Canada, 7 per 100,000 in the USA (based on data only from Olmsted County, Minnesota).87 The pathogenesis of IBD is not completely understood. Genetic and environmental factors such as altered luminal bacteria and enhanced intestinal permeability play a role in the dysregulation of intestinal immunity, leading to GI injury. An abnormal activation of the mucosal immune system driven by the presence of the intestinal microbiota in a genetically predisposed patient seems to play a key role in this pathology. Especially in CD the intestinal microbiota is strongly suspected to play a role in initiating and triggering the immune system, leading to a characteristic inflammation. Furrie et al.88 used a synbiotc combining a probiotic, B. longum, isolated from healthy rectal epithelium, and a prebiotic (Synergy 1), a preferential inulin-oligofructose growth substrate for the probiotic strain to treat UC patients. Treatment was employed in a double blinded randomized controlled trial using 18 patients with active UC for a period of one month. Clinical status was scored and rectal biopsies were collected before and after treatment, and transcription levels of epithelium related immune markers were measured. The Authors conclude that short-term synbiotic treatment of active UC resulted in improvement of the full clinical appearance of chronic inflammation in patients receiving this therapy.",

They found that a reduction of a major member of Firmicutes, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, is associated with a higher risk of post-operative recurrence of ileal CD. This study was conducted as part of a double-blind controlled trial that compared the efficiency of the probiotic L. johnsonii LA1 strain and a placebo to decrease endoscopic recurrence after curative surgery for CD. Although the whole human trial included 98 patients, the present study, included only a subset of these patients. F. prausnitzii A2\u2013165 (DSM 17677), isolated from human fecal stool, was grown at 37 \u00b0C in LYHBHI medium (Brain\u2013heart infusion medium supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (Difco) and 5 mg/L hemin) supplemented with cellobiose (1 mg/ml; Sigma\u2013Aldrich), maltose (1 mg/ml; Sigma), and cysteine (0.5 mg/ml; Sigma) in an anaerobic chamber. A lower proportion of F. prausnitzii on resected ileal Crohn mucosa was also associated with endoscopic recurrence at 6 months. The Authors observed the antinflammatory effects in both in vitro (cellular models) and in vivo [2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced] colitis in mice to evaluate the immunomodulatory properties of F. prausnitzii In Caco-2 cells transfected with a reporter gene for NF-\u03baB activity. The study showed the following results: 1) F. prausnitzii had no effect on IL-1beta-induced NF-\u03baB activity, whereas the supernatant abolished it; 2) in vitro PBMC stimulation by F. prausnitzii led to significantly lower IL-12 and IFN-gamma production levels and higher secretion of IL-10; 3) oral administration of either live F. prausnitzii or its supernatant markedly reduced the severity of TNBS colitis and tended to correct the dysbiosis associated with TNBS colitis, as demonstrated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. In conclusion these results show that F. prausnitzii is an anti-inflammatory bacterial candidate. This bacterium exhibited anti-inflammatory effects, partly due to secreted metabolites blocking NF-\u03baB activation and IL-8 secretion. In vivo effects were associated with a decrease in proinflammatory colonic cytokine synthesis and with the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Counter balancing dysbiosis, using the commensal bacterium F. prausnitzii as a candidate probiotic agent, appears to be a promising strategy in CD treatment. Further clinical studies are required to establish the diagnostic tools to define the best population of patients for this probiotic species, and especially whether the clinical benefit is more pronounced in patients with low levels of endogenous Firmicutes.",

Ten active CD outpatients without history of operation for CD were enrolled (CD was diagnosed by established clinical, endoscopic, radiological and histological criteria.). Their mean (\u00b1) age was 27 \u00b1 7 years and the main symptoms presented were diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients\u2019 initial therapeutic regimen of aminosalicylates and prednisolone failed to achieve remission. Patients were thus initiated into a synbiotic therapy, consisting of both probiotics (75 billion CFU daily) and prebiotics (psyllium 9.9 g daily). Probiotics mainly comprised Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Patients were free to adjust their intake of probiotics or prebiotics throughout the trial. Chron's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD) score and blood sample variables were evaluated and compared before and after the trial. The duration of the trial was 13.0 \u00b1 4.5 months. By the end of therapy, each patient had taken a 45 \u00b1 24 billion CFU daily probiotic dose, with six patients taking an additional 7.9 \u00b1 3.6 g daily psyllium dose. Seven patients had improved clinical symptoms following combined probiotic and prebiotic therapy. Both CDAI and IOIBD scores were significantly reduced after therapy (255\u2013136, P = 0.009; 3.5\u20132.1, P = 0.03, respectively). Six patients had a complete response, one had a partial response, and three were non responders. Two patients were able to discontinue their prednisolone therapy, while four patients decreased their intake. There were no adverse events. High-dose probiotic and prebiotic cotherapy can be safely and effectively used for the treatment of active CD. In conclusion, our study shows that synbiotic therapy can safely reduce CD activity and achieve its remission. We found that synbiotic therapy is especially indicated for CD patients with frequent diarrhea. Further studies, examining such areas as fecal flora and SCFAs that compare CD patients with probiotics to CD patients with synbiotics, are expected. Larger scale studies and randomized controlled studies on the treatment of CD with probiotic therapy in combination with prebiotics are clearly necessary for a fuller appreciation of the therapeutic value of synbiotics.",

The treatment consisted of the probiotic LA1 in freeze-dried form and blended with maltodextrin at 1010 CFU/day. The placebo was maltodextrin only. The LA1 powder was supplied in foil sachets (weight 2 g) containing 1010 CFU of probiotics. The placebo was a powder of the same appearance and weight, also in individual foil packets. Both probiotics and placebo were administered in combination with an enteral formula at 120 mL/day (ACD004, Nunspeet, Holland, Konolfingen, Switzerland). The identity of the treatment sachet was blind to patients, support staff, and investigators (numerical codes). Treatment codes were broken only by the statistician after completion of the trial. The primary objective was to assess the effect of LA1 on the endoscopic recurrence rate at 12 weeks. Stratification was performed according to smoking status at randomization.

H. pylori is strongly associated with duodenal peptic ulceration and it is the main etiologic agent of chronic gastritis and gastric cancer and other gastric malignancies. Today the therapy to eradicate this bacterium is based on a combination of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors (PPI). The (13)C-urea breath test is the commonly used test to diagnose the presence of H. pylori in the stomach. The test also finds application to understand if H. pylori has been eradicated through a treatment with antibiotics. The urea breath test is based on the ability of H. pylori to break down urea, a chemical made up of nitrogen and carbon, into carbon dioxide which then is absorbed from the stomach and eliminated in the breath. For the test, patients swallow a capsule containing urea made from an isotope of carbon. If H. pylori is present in the stomach, the urea is broken up and turned into carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is absorbed across the lining of the stomach and into the blood. It then travels in the blood to the lungs where it is excreted in the breath. Samples of exhaled breath are collected, and the isotopic carbon in the exhaled carbon dioxide is measured. If the isotope is detected in the breath, it means that H. pylori is present in the stomach. If the isotope is not found, H. pylori is not present. Probiotics seem to have a direct antimicrobial effect, as shown through in vitro studies, through competition with H. pylori, inhibition of adherence and production of metabolites and antimicrobial molecules. Implementation of probiotics with standard anti-H. pylori regimens can also improve patients\u2019 compliance with therapy, reducing the incidence of side effects associated with antibiotic treatment.",

CBM588 is a probiotic agent containing approximately 107 cfu per tablet.

Additionally, during eradication therapy, C. difficile toxin A was detected in both group A and group B but not in group C. The Authors conclude that side effects associated with H.

In vivo, L. reuteri reduces H. pylori load as semiquantitatively assessed by both (13)C-urea breath test delta-value and H. Pylori stool antigen quantification after 4 weeks of treatment (p < 0.05). No change was shown in patients receiving placebo. L. Reuteri administration was followed by a significant decrease in the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale as compared to pretreatment value (p < 0.05) that was not present in those ones receiving placebo (p = not significant). No difference in eradication rates was observed. L. Reuteri effectively suppresses H. pylori infection in humans and decreases the occurrence of dyspeptic symptoms. Nevertheless, it does not seem to affect antibiotic therapy outcome. The Authors report that a 4-week supplementation with L. reuteri is effective in reducing H. pylori bacterial load in humans and theoretically may help to control gastric inflammation.",

The secondary aim of the study was to define the effect of S. Boulardii on the eradication success of anti-H. pylori therapy. One hundred and twenty-four patients with H. Pylori infection (male/female: 44/80, mean age: 48 \u00b1 14.25 year) receiving 14 days of triple therapy (clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 1000 mg b.i.d., and lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d.) were randomly assigned to S. Boulardii or placebo. Dyspeptic symptoms were recorded using modified Glasgow Dyspepsia Questionnaire (GDQ). Side-effect profile and tolerability were assessed using a symptom-based questionnaire. H. pylori status was rechecked 6 weeks after completion of eradication therapy. H. Pylori eradication rate, although higher in the treatment group, was statistically similar in treatment and control groups: 71% (44/62) versus 59.7% (37/62), respectively (p > 0.05). Nine (14.5%) patients in the treatment group and 19 (30.6%) patients in the placebo group experienced diarrhea (p < 0.05). Epigastric discomfort was more frequent in the control group [9 (14.5%) versus 27 (43.5%), respectively (p < 0.01)]. Diffuse abdominal pain, abdominal gas, taste disturbance, urticaria and nausea symptoms were similar in both groups. GDQ scores after treatment were significantly better for treatment group (mean \u00b1 SD, range: 1.38 \u00b1 1.25 (0\u20135) vs. 2.22 \u00b1 1.44 (0\u20136), respectively; p < 0.01). The Authors conclude that S. Boulardii improves anti-H. Pylori antibiotherapy-associated diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, and treatment tolerability. In addition, Saccharomyces boulardii supplement decreases post-treatment dyspepsia symptoms independent of H. pylori status. Addition of S. boulardii does not affect the rate of H. pylori eradication.",

            "text": "Colon cancer is a multi-factorial and complex neoplasm involving both genetics and environmental factors. There seems to be a strong relationship between colon cancer, diet and intestinal microflora. The rupture of the intestinal microflora equilibrium due to a bad diet seems to be related to an increase in the risk of developing colon cancer. Liong30 underlines the different properties attributed to probiotics and prebiotics in the past years such as anti-carcinogenic, antimutagenic properties, ability of modifying differentiation processes in tumor cells, production of SCFAs and alteration of tumor gene expressions but he also evidences that, despite all the positive findings, other researchers have also reported insignificant colon cancer protective effects. Certain bacterial species in the colon produce harmful substances that seem to be correlated to cancer. That is why it has been thought that probiotics may modulate several major intestinal functions potentially associated with the development of colon cancer preventing the growth of deleterious organisms, producing anti-carcinogenic substances and moving the balance of gut bacteria in favour of the ones beneficial for the organism. Colon cancer has been correlated to high fat diets and it is thought to be due to colon raised levels of bile acids which help digest fat. These salts are released into the small intestine, and also re-absorbed there, but some may pass into the colon. The break down products of bile may have a cytotoxic effect on the cells lining the colon, increasing cell proliferation and possibly cancer. Probiotic modulation of the intestinal microflora may affect the activity of one of the enzymes (7a-dehydroxylase) forming these toxic products but probiotics may also reduce the toxicity of bile salts binding to them. While growing in the colon, probiotics seem to exert different functions such as controlling the growth of potentially harmful bacteria, binding to mutagens, preventing harmful enzyme activity in the gut (\u03b2-glucoronidase, nitroreductase), interacting with the cells of the colon, forming conjugated linoleic acid, a compound with anti-inflammatory properties that may inhibiting the development of cancer. It may also increase levels of butyric acid in the colon which is an important energy source and growth regulator for colon cells, stimulating the activity of beneficial enzymes that inactivate carcinogens (glutathione S transferase) and the immune system, and produce products that have a beneficial effect on the cells of the colon (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium produce lactic acid and similar SCFAs increasing the gut lumen acidity). Moreover Takeda et al.100 suggest that daily intake of Lactobacillus\ncasei strain Shirota provides a positive effect on the activity of NK cells which seem to exert a key role in protecting the human organism against cancer.",

Thirty-eight healthy men participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover study with treatment periods of 4 weeks. Subjects consumed daily bacterial or placebo capsules. Bacterial capsules contained viable LC705 and PJS. LC705 (DSM7061) and PJS (DSM7067), which are commonly used in the manufacture of ripened, semi-hard cheeses. The freeze-dried bacteria were filled in gelatine capsules. The subjects consumed daily two capsules containing viable LC705 and PJS (2 \u00d7 1010 CFU of each strain daily) or two placebo capsules. The same amount of this particular bacterial combination had previously shown physiological effects in two human studies. The amount of bacteria in the capsules remained unchanged during the study. In addition to the bacteria, the capsules contained microcrystalline cellulose as a filler. The placebo capsules were of identical composition but without the bacteria. Subjects were instructed to take the capsules daily with the first meal of the day. The activities of \u03b2-glucosidase, \u03b2-glucuronidase and urease, recovery of LC705 and PJS, and counts of total lactobacilli and propionibacteria were determined from feces. The mean fecal counts of total lactobacilli and propionibacteria as well as LC705 and PJS strains were significantly increased during the administration of bacteria (3.5-, 13-, 80- and 11-fold, respectively). \u03b2-glucosidase activity decreased by 10% (P = 0.18) and urease activity by 13% (P = 0.16) during bacterial supplementation versus placebo. The change in \u03b2-glucosidase activity was negatively correlated with the change in propionibacteria counts (R = \u22120.350, P = 0.039), being \u22122.68 versus 0.94 nmol/min/mg protein in subjects with increased and unchanged/decreased propionibacteria, respectively (P = 0.003). In conclusion, the administration of LC705 and PJS was followed by an increase in the fecal counts of lactobacilli and propionibacteria and a decrease in the activity of \u03b2-glucosidase with increasing counts of propionibacteria. The Authors conclude that the administration of LC705 together with PJS was associated with a decrease in \u03b2-glucosidase activity related to the increasing counts of propionibacteria, although we found no significant influence on the activity of three bacterial enzymes, \u03b2-glucosidase, urease and \u03b2-glucuronidase, compared to placebo. To evaluate the effect of the carcinogenic potential of those enzymes and the safety of those strains further studies are warranted.",

In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, thirty-four colon cancer patients who had undergone \u2018curative resection\u2019 and forty polypectomized patients participated. Subjects of the SYN group daily received encapsulated bacteria (1 \u00d7 1010 CFU of L. rhamnosus GG and 1 \u00d7 1010 CFU of Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 (Bb12)) and 10 g of inulin enriched with oligofructose. Controls received encapsulated maltodextrin and 10 g of maltodextrin. Prior to intervention (T1), and 6 (T2) and 12 weeks after the start of the intervention (T3), phagocytic and respiratory burst activity of neutrophils and monocytes, lytic activity of NK cells and production of IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12, as well as TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma by activated PBMC were measured. In feces, the concentrations of transforming growth factor-b1 and prostaglandin E2 were measured. IL-2 secretion by activated PBMC from the polypectomized group increased significantly between T1 or T2 and T3 (P < 0.05). In the cancer group, SYN treatment resulted in an increased capacity of PBMC to produce IFN-gamma at T3 (P < 0.05). Other immunity-related parameters were not affected by SYN treatment, neither in the cancer nor in the polypectomized group. In conclusion, supplementation with this SYN has minor stimulatory effects on the systemic immune system of the two study groups. The Authors conclude thatno negative effects were observed in cancer and polypectomized patients with daily consumption of this SYN for 12 weeks, but more definitive testing is required to indicate conclusively that this product is safe. The SYN supplement had only minor effects on the immune system of the subjects in both groups. It is possible that SYN supplementation in humans preferentially affects the gut-associated lymphoid tissue rather than the systemic immune system.",

The 12 week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a synbiotic food composed of the prebiotic SYN1 and probiotics L. rhamnosus GG and Bb12 was conducted in 37 colon cancer patients and 43 polypectomized patients. Treatment consisted of a synbiotic preparation that contained the prebiotic SYN1 and the probiotic strains Bb12 and Lactobacillus delbreuckii subspecies rhamnosus strain GG. SYN1 is an oligofructose-enriched inulin preparation. Fecal and blood samples were obtained before, during, and after the intervention, and colorectal biopsy samples were obtained before and after the intervention. The effect of synbiotic consumption on a battery of intermediate biomarkers for colon cancer was examined. Synbiotic intervention resulted in significant changes in fecal flora: Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus increased and Clostridium perfringens decreased. The intervention significantly reduced colorectal proliferation and the capacity of fecal water to induce necrosis in colonic cells and improve epithelial barrier function in polypectomized patients. Genotoxicity assays of colonic biopsy samples indicated a decreased exposure to genotoxins in polypectomized patients at the end of the intervention period. Synbiotic consumption prevented an increased secretion of IL-2 by means of PBMC in the polypectomized patients and increased the production of interferon in the cancer patients. The Authors conclude that the synbiotic intervention results in significant alterations in the composition of the colonic bacterial ecosystem, which presumably has consequences for the metabolic activity of the colon. These results also provide indirect evidence that some of the consequences of the synbiotic intervention might be a decreased exposure of the epithelium to cytotoxic and genotoxic agents, a decreased colonic cell proliferation and an improved mucosa structure.",

Rotavirus was isolated in 75.85%. There was no significant difference between treatment groups in the daily frequency or duration of diarrhea or vomiting or in the length of hospital stay. No complication was observed from the use of L. rhamnosus GG. L. rhamnosus GG supplementation did not decrease the frequency and duration of diarrhea and vomiting in children with AWD, and does not reduce hospital stay in these patients.",

After collection, feces was analyzed as to the composition of the intestinal microbiota, and beta\u2013glucosidase activity, endotoxin concentration, C. difficile toxin A, SCFAs, and pH were determined. Bowel movements were scored according to the Bristol stool form scale. Mean number of enterococci increased significantly from log 4.1 at day 0 to log 5.8 (day 7) and log 6.9 (day 14) cfu/g feces (P < 0.05) during probiotic intake. Although no other significant differences were observed between both intervention groups, within each group significant changes were found over time in both microbial composition and metabolic activity. Moreover, bowel movements with a frequency > or = 3 per day for at least 2 days and/or a consistency > or = 5 for at least 2 days were reported less frequently in the probiotic compared to the placebo group (48% vs 79%, P < 0.05). This study shows that, apart from an increase in enterococci, no significant differences in microbial composition and metabolic activity are observed in the probiotic compared with the placebo group. However, changes over time were present in both groups, which differed significantly between the probiotic and the placebo arm, suggesting that the amoxycillin effect was modulated by probiotic intake. The intake of a multispecies probiotic significantly reduced diarrhea-like bowel movements in healthy volunteers receiving amoxicillin.",

Different matings were performed adding to the donor and recipient cells L. plantarum 35d bac and L. plantarum 396/1 bac as agents of interference. Conjugations added with a Staphylococcus aureus strain or without any agent of interference were used as controls. Both lactobacillus strains were able to decrease mating frequency.

The effect was almost the same with the two L. plantarum independent of bacteriocin production.

Several studies showed a link between a lack of colonization by O. Formigenes and a recurrence of oxalate stone formation. Moreover, among the stone formers, a lack of O. Formigenes is associated with hyperoxaluria. A higher urinary oxalate excretion in female calcium oxalate formers with recurrent UTI may be associated with the application of antibiotics and a subsequent eradication of O. Formigenes. A permanent decolonization was also found in cystic fibrosis patients. The Authors analyzed some clinical trials involving humans who followed administration of 500 mg of O.
