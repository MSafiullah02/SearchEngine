            "text": "\nLitopenaeus vannamei, also known as Pacific white shrimp, is an economically important variety of shrimp. However, production of L. vannamei is limited by its susceptibility to various diseases. In China, covert mortality disease (CMD) has been reported in pond cultures of L. vannamei recently (Xu and Ji, 2009, Zhang et al., 2014). The epidemiology study proved the prevalence of CMD in shrimp ponds in Thailand, Indonesia, India and Ecuador (Flegel, 2014). Typical clinical signs of CMD in the shrimp include hepatopancreas atrophy and necrosis, soft shell, slow growth, and abdominal muscle whitening and necrosis in the acute stage (Gu, 2012, Huang, 2012, Zhang, 2004, Zhang et al., 2014). The symptom of abdominal muscle whitening and necrosis is similar to the symptoms reported in the early stages of disease caused by infectious myonecrosis virus (IMNV) and Penaeus vannamei nodavirus (PvNV) in the shrimp. However, these diseases can be distinguished by RT-PCR (Zhang et al., 2014). CMD-related mortality has been found to be sporadic, and may be increased by environmental stress, such as high temperature. When the water temperature rises above 28 \u00b0C, survival in infected ponds decreases sharply and the cumulative mortality rate of shrimps infected by CMD has been reported to be up to 80% (Gu, 2012, Xing, 2004, Xu and Ji, 2009).",

A new nodavirus, designated as covert mortality nodavirus (CMNV) (Zhang et al., 2014), was found to be the causative agent of CMD. Like other members of the genus Alphanodavirus, the genome of CMNV is a positive single-stranded RNA. Histological examination of the diseased L. vannamei shrimp revealed atrophied, structurally discorded, hepatopancreas tubules and coagulative necrosis of skeletal muscle. Eosinophilic inclusions were detected in the hepatopancreas and lymphoid organ (Zhang et al., 2014). Specimens of the main economic species of shrimp in China, Fenneropenaeus chinensis (Chinese white shrimp) and Marsupenaeus japonicus (Japanese tiger prawn), were also found to be infected by CMNV in an epidemiological investigation conducted using histological examination and RT-PCR for virus detection (Zhang et al., 2014). Therefore, the risk of a CMNV pandemic in both farmed and wild shrimp is substantial.",

The results showed that the amplification occurred earlier when the reaction was incubated at 65 \u00b0C compared with the other incubation temperatures (Fig. 1\nA). Experiments to optimize the concentrations of MgCl2 and dNTPs showed that the smallest average Ct value (22.38) was generated when the concentrations of MgCl2 and dNTPs were 4.0 mM and 1.4 mM, respectively. However, the smallest average Ct value was accompanied by a standard error of 0.65, indicating substantial fluctuations in amplification efficiency. Meanwhile, the third smallest Ct value (23.31), with the smallest standard error of 0.04, was obtained when the concentrations of MgCl2 and dNTPs were 6.0 mM and 1.6 mM, respectively. Therefore, the optimal concentrations of MgCl2 and dNTPs were determined to be 6.0 mM and 1.6 mM, respectively. The real-time kinetics of the RT-LAMP reaction, with or without loop primers, was analyzed with 6.0 mM of MgCl2, 1.6 mM of dNTPs and incubation at 65 \u00b0C. The results indicated that the time required for initiation of amplification was 29.6 min with loop primers or 46.5 min without loop primers, which indicated that using loop primers accelerated the amplification, thereby reducing the detection time, compared with RT-LAMP without loop primers. Based on these findings, further RT-LAMP assays were incubated for 50 min at 65 \u00b0C with 6 mM MgCl2 and 1.6 mM dNTPs.",
