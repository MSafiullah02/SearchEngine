It is estimated that over 5% of the global population has asthma, which translates to a staggering 350 million people worldwide (1) . It is more common in developed countries, where incidence rates can run as high as 20%. The incidence has also been increasing, first in developed countries, and now in developing nations. Mortality rates of asthma show no significant improvement despite the development of new drugs and strategies to treat asthma. Yet for a disease that affects so many people, there is no single diagnostic test available, and the ability to make a diagnosis depends solely on the clinical skills of the modern day physician. It is a huge challenge. We recognize now that asthma is not one disease, but a heterogeneous group of disorders. Making a diagnosis of asthma involves a thinking process that incorporates so many factors, both genetic and environmental, that patients are frequently misdiagnosed. Two people can present to the physician with an identical clinical presentation, and only one will leave with a diagnosis of asthma. How is this possible? The answer can be found in the realization that clinical symptoms that we commonly attribute to asthma are not pathognomonic of the disease, and many other conditions can cause symptoms such as cough, wheezing, or respiratory distress.",

Modern pathological and laboratory techniques have allowed us to study the diseased airways in asthmatics. The early descriptions noted above describe an \"obstruction,\" and even as recently as 30 years ago, our belief was that asthma was a condition primarily of bronchoconstriction. We now know that bronchoconstriction is more likely a result or epiphenomenon of changes that occur at the cellular level that lead to inflammation of the airways, characterized by smooth muscle hypertrophy, increased vascular permeability and mucous production. These are the known histological events of inflammation, which then lead to the hallmark physiologic features of inflammationheat, erythema, swelling, and drainage. All of these have been shown to occur in the asthmatic airway. The clinical results of these inflammatory changes are cough, wheezing, respiratory distress, inadequate oxygenation of blood and clearance of carbon dioxide, respiratory acidosis and potentially, death. If the changes are chronic, then there can be permanent damage to the structure of the airway epithelium, a process loosely known as \"airway remodeling,\" leading to the development of an irreversible process more closely resembling chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema.",

Of course, a more complete history and physical will help to rule out diagnoses until one has no other possibility left other than asthma. Similarly, a differential diagnosis for wheeze can include asthma, but also congestive heart failure, transmitted sounds of upper airway congestion or obstruction, tracheal anomalies, vascular rings, vasculitides and vocal cord dysfunction. Respiratory distress could be a result of a chronic lung condition, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, smoke inhalation, congestive heart failure, respiratory muscle weakness, or a metabolic problem. Again, sorting out the clinical history and physical to come up with the most likely diagnosis depends on the clinical skills of the physician.

Within the initial wheezing group, a subgroup of children with severe wheezing was additionally formed at 10 years of age in 1965. These groups have been followed at 7-year intervals since. The last published review comprised data up until 1999, when the participants were on average (3) . Throughout the study, the individuals who were initially classified as having mild or severe asthma continued to have consistently decreased FEV1/FVC ratios when compared to the control group. Interestingly, these individuals' decreased FEV1/FVC ratios were established at 7-10 years of age and remained decreased at 42 years of age. Of note, the respective decreased FEV1/FVC ratios were at their lowest at the 10 years of age mark, and did not worsen (relative to the control group) with progression to adulthood despite continued symptoms of asthma. In the second cohort asthma study, the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, 1,139 children were enrolled at birth and followed at 2-to 5-year intervals, from 9 to 26 years of age (4) . A total of 613 individuals were able to provide respiratory assessment at every time point. Persistent wheezing individuals (those reporting wheezing at all survey time points) and relapse wheezing individuals (those reporting wheezing at two or more consecutive survey points, followed by one or more survey points without wheezing, and finally reporting wheezing at all subsequent follow ups) had reduced FEV1/FVC ratios in comparison to children without wheeze. Similar to the Melbourne Asthma Study, this reduction was initially seen at 9 years of age when the initial FEV1/FVC evaluation was preformed. In all groups, there was no difference in the slopes of change in FEV1/FVC ratio as would be expected with increasing age. Interestingly, the reduced FEV1/FVC ratios of the persistent and relapse wheezing individuals, in relation to the nonwheezing and mild wheezing individuals, generally followed the same trend showing very little deterioration, from 9 to 26 years of age. Both studies contribute to the hypothesis that the insult, which results in reduced FEV1/FVC ratio in asthmatic individuals, occurs at a very young age.",

The study included 1,041 children with mild to moderate asthma from CAMP, compared with 5,415 children without asthma, from the Harvard Six Cities Study (H6CS). Strunk et al. used FEV1/FVC ratios, a reliable assessment of airway obstruction, and found that in male children with mild to moderate asthma FEV1/ FVC was \u22127.3% at 6 years of age and \u22129.8% at 18 years of age compared to age-and sex-matched controls (5) . Female children with mild to moderate asthma had FEV1/ FVC of \u22127.1% at 6 years of age and \u22129.9% at 18 years of age compared to age-and sex-matched controls (5) . The findings are significant for showing over 70% of obstruction existed before 6 years of age and a progression of obstruction from 6 to 18 years of age. This disagrees with the Melbourne Asthma Study and the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, and may be due to an increased number of participants.

These tests are conducted by a trained technician and the response in pulmonary function to escalating doses of methacholine is measured. The doses of methacholine used generally ranges from 0.02 to 25.0 mg/mL, and are usually given in doubling doses. The most recent ATS recommendations define two different methodologies: the 2 min tidal breathing method and the 5 min dosimeter method. Dosing starts low, at about 0.03 mg/mL, and increase to a maximum dose of 16.0 or 32.0 mg/mL. Spirometry is performed after each incremental dose is administered, and a 20% drop in FEV1 at any time signifies a positive test. The PC20 FEV1 is the provocative concentration of methacholine that will result in a 20% drop in FEV1. If this drop occurs at a low dose, such as 2 mg/mL, then this is a positive test for asthma, but if there is no drop or the drop occurs at a very high dose, e.g., 32 mg/mL, then this indicates a negative test for asthma. If a drop occurs, the patient should be given bronchodilators to ensure that pulmonary function returns to normal.",

These include cigarette smoking, viral infections, exposure to occupational sensitizers or allergens, exercising or the use of bronchodilators, or consumption of foods that can facilitate bronchodilation such as caffeine, prior to the test. Moreover, the test is dependent on the proper technique in performing spirometry; otherwise, the test results will not be valid. Therefore, even methacholine challenge testing cannot be deemed to be 100% diagnostic for asthma, but should be viewed as a very valuable tool in helping to establish the diagnosis of asthma, while taking into context the clinical presentation of the patient. Methacholine challenge testing is indicated when the probability of asthma as the correct diagnosis is assessed to be between 30 and 70% (6).",

Indeed, there are surrogate markers of inflammation that are available in clinical practice at this time. The question is how specific and sensitive these tests are in diagnosing asthma. Are they useful in defining the patient with asthma? Current indirect measures of inflammation, also quaintly known as inflammometry, include fractional exhaled FeNO, eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), analysis of sputum and spirometry, which has already been discussed.",

In fact, there are FeNO measurement devices produced by several manufacturers for clinician office use. However, how valuable is FeNO analysis in the diagnosis of asthma? This has been a very controversial topic because there are other conditions that can cause an increase in FeNO, including viral infections or atopy. FeNO is perhaps a better tool for assessing and monitoring the status of the moderate or severe persistent asthma whose condition changes based on exposure to triggers and adjustment of medications. FeNO is therefore not a \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis of asthma by any means. It can, however, be of some benefit when taken in context of the individual patient, as long as one is aware of the limitations of these measurements.",

Eosinophils can be activated to lead to the production of inflammatory mediators, such as ECP and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin. But many other mediators are released as a result of eosinophil activation that can contribute to asthma. Eosinophil cationic protein has been investigated as a marker for airway inflammation in asthma. It was demonstrated that serum ECP is elevated in patients who are undergoing an acute asthma exacerbation, when compared to stable asthmatics or controls. As in the case of FeNO, ECP appears to be more useful as a tool to monitor asthma status, rather than providing any significant value into the diagnosis of asthma. This is probably true for measurement of sputum eosinophils as well.",

In turn, this remodeling leads to airway wall thickening/airway narrowing, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, hypersecretion of mucus, and airway edema. Saglani et al. have recently reported compelling findings in children between the ages of 3 months and 5 years (7) . Endobronchial biopsies were taken from 16 \"confirmed wheezers\" (video questionnaire), 14 \"reported wheezers,\" and ten controls (nonasthmatic children presenting with stridor). \"Confirmed wheezers\" had significantly thicker reticular basement membrane and significantly greater eosinophilic inflammation, compared to controls. Prior to this study, Saglani et al. examined endobronchial biopsies in 53 infants between 11.5 and 12.4 months of age (8) . Infants with decreased specific airway conductance with bronchodilator reversibility and infants with decreased specific airway conductance without bronchodilator reversibility were compared with age-matched controls. Interestingly, no difference was found in reticular basement membrane thickness or inflammatory cell number. Taken together, these studies suggest the possibility that there may be a \"developmental window of susceptibility\" (9) for asthma between infancy and 5-6 years of age. This age is of particular interest because it typically is the period of time when the usual trigger for wheezing in children is respiratory infection, likely caused by viruses. It has been proposed that this typical wheezing pattern seen in some children may be due to an inappropriate inflammatory response to normally innocuous viral infections. This inappropriate response could possibly lead to airway remodeling and subsequent asthma.",

Viruses associated with asthma exacerbations include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza, parainfluenza, and coronavirus (Table 2) (13).

RSV usually causes upper respiratory tract infections, but in some infants, it causes lower respiratory tract infections, leading to bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Bronchiolitis due to RSV is the most common cause of wheeze in infants and young children (13, 21) . Studies of children hospitalization for RSV bronchiolitis with wheeze have reported an increased risk of wheeze or asthma at least through the preteen years. Sigurs et al. prospectively studied 47 children who had been hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis, and compared them with a group of 93 sex, age, family history for reactive airway disease or atopy, and generally living environment-matched controls (22) . At 13 years of age, the children who had previously suffered RSV bronchiolitis had more than a fourfold greater chance of developing wheeze/asthma (43 vs. 8%) (22) . Stein et al. prospectively studied 888 children who had a history of lower respiratory tract infections due to various agents within their first 3 years (23) . Of this group, 207 children had a history of lower respiratory tract infection due to RSV. These children had a significantly increased risk of wheeze at 6 years of age, but this risk declined at 11 years of age, and was not significant at 13 years of age (23) . Additionally, at 11 years of age, force expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was measured in 110 of the children with a history of lower respiratory tract infection due to RSV. When compared to controls, these children had FEV1s which were significantly reduced, but normalized when treated with salbutamol. The pathophysiology of RSV infection's association with asthma is unresolved, but it is known that RSV infection is mucosa-restricted and that it induces airway epithelium to recruit inflammatory cells through the production of multiple chemokines. These include fractalkine, growth-regulated oncogene alpha (Gro-a), Gro-b, Gro-g, interleukin 8 (IL-8), interferon-inducing T-cell alpha chemoattractant, macrophage inflammatory protein 1a (MIP1a), MIP1b, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), and regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) (24, 25) .

Lombardi et al. studied 360 children from the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study who had not previously been diagnosed with asthma at 6 years of age (42) . Positive skin prick testing at the age of 6 was found to be a significant and independent predictor of subsequent development of both persistent and incident asthma from 6 to 11 years of age (hazard ratio = 3.7, 95% confidence interval 1.8-7.4; p < 0.001) (42) . More interesting, Lowe et al. prospectively studied a birth cohort of 498 children from the National Asthma Campaign Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study who completed both skin prick testing (dust mite, dog, and cat) and body plethysmographic measurement of specific airway resistance at 3 years of age (43) . Through multivariate analysis, they found that children sensitized to an allergen without exposure to that allergen and nonsensitized children exposed to an allergen had normal airway resistance (43) . Yet, children who were sensitized to a particular allergen and exposed to that allergen had increased airway resistance (43) .",

Children sensitized to perennial allergens (house dust mite, dog, and cat dander) on ImmunoCAP (Phadia, Freiberg, Germany), and exposed to high levels of the respective allergens within the first 3 years of life, had significantly reduced lung function (FVC and maximal expiratory flow at 50% [MEF50], measured by body plethysmograph) at school age, when compared to nonsensitized children or sensitized children who were exposed to less allergen (44) . Interestingly, sensitization and exposure to perennial allergens at older ages had weaker effects, and sensitization and exposure to seasonal allergens (mixed grass and birch pollen) were not significantly relevant (44) . In this same study, 90% of nonatopic children with wheeze lost their symptoms by school age and had normal lung function at puberty (44) . Previously noted, Jackson et al., who found an association of wheezing due to RV at 3 years of age and a diagnosis of asthma at 6 years of age, also found an association of aeroallergen sensitization and asthma at 6 years of age. Prospectively following 259 children in a high-risk birth cohort (one parent with respiratory allergies and/or a history of asthma diagnosed by a physician), they found that aeroallergen sensitization independently increased the risk of asthma at 6 years of age (26) .",

This condition can lead to severe asthma exacerbations when patients are exposed to aspirin, and can even include anaphylaxis or urticaria. Treatment is by aspirin desensitizations, and there are standard protocols available for performing aspirin desensitization safely and with optimal effectiveness.
