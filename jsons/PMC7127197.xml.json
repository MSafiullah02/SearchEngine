This also depends on the ventilation scheme used. Indeed, the ventilation system determines the airflow pattern in the room which in turn decides the droplet nucleus fate. Displacement ventilation has been acknowledged to provide better indoor air quality than mixing ventilation. Some existing studies that used passive gaseous and small inertial particles as contaminant sources stated that in the presence of heat sources, displacement ventilation is more contributive to pollutants removal without much mixing to the whole indoor environments and this compared to other types of ventilation [9], [10]. These studies also showed that in order to design an effective ventilation system, it is crucial to have a reliable tool that is capable to predict airflow pattern and particle distribution and dispersion indoors. This can be achieved through the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) which has the capacity to provide microscopic information on the indoor air environment like the air velocity, pressure, temperature, and pollutant's concentration distribution which are useful to obtain pertinent macroscopic parameters for engineering goals.",

            "text": "Among these CFD tools, Reynolds averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS) simulation has been extensively used for simulation of airflow indoors to predict the averaged velocity or temperature. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) solves directly for the transient behavior of the large-scale turbulent motion which tends to have the greatest influence on the turbulent transport but less adjustable constants are required [11]. LES approach to model turbulent flows has been recognised as a powerful tool that is able to satisfy a continuing desire for higher fidelity of predictive capabilities. Its use has been invigorated by the extraordinary development of computational facilities. Since LES solves time-dependant turbulent flows, it can provide detailed description of the turbulence phenomenon, such as three-dimensional instantaneous velocity field. Thus, LES properly accounts for the history and transport effects of turbulence on aerosol dispersion and deposition. The very informative picture of the turbulent transport provided by LES has usually been associated with a large computational expense that has prevented its use in the past. However, many recent works have shown that LES computations carried out on current computer workstations have been successfully applied to several indoor airflow problems with reasonable computation overheads [3]. Among these studies, we can mention the work of Emmerich and McGrattan [12] and Musser and McGrattan [13] who applied LES to investigate isothermal room airflow. Jiang and Chen [14] who explored the potential of LES to study natural ventilation in buildings. Zhang et al. [15] evaluated various turbulence models, including LES, in predicting airflow and turbulence in enclosed environments and Zhang and Chen [11] proposed a filtered dynamic subgrid scale model to be used in conjunction with LES of indoor airflow. All these investigations have shown the great potential of LES in predicting turbulent airflow in enclosed environments but none of them have considered thermal effects generated by human.",

            "text": "For LES of two-phase turbulent flows, the numerical simulation of the particulate trajectories and dispersion pattern in airflows are treated along two streams namely the Lagrangian and the Eulerian methods. The Eulerian methods consider the particle phase as another continuum. Transport equation for the mass concentration is derived from the mass (species) conservation conditions and solved to give details of the particle concentration field. When the particle phase is considered as scalar species, the gravitational settling and the deposition rate should be taken properly into account to reflect the aerosol's inertial character [1], [6]. For the Lagrangian methodology, the motion of the discrete matters are described by the force balance including those induced by the interactions with the carrier phase. In indoor particle studies, each method gains its own reputation depending on the research goals. The Eulerian method is widely used to predict particle concentration distributions in rooms. Generally these simulations agree well with experimental data although remarkable discrepancies exist in some studies [4]. If the particle motion and dispersion history is of interest, the Lagrangian method is more suitable. Indeed, the Lagrangian approach appears to provide a more natural description of the actual physical phenomena compared to the Eulerian approach. Investigations using two-phase LES to study particle transport in enclosed environments are rare in literature. We can mention the works of Tian et al. [16], Bouilly et al. [17] and Chang et al. [18].",

For conventional ceiling schemes the influence of high momentum airflow overwhelms the buoyancy effect and the pollutant transport is mainly governed by the bulk airflow [5]. Nevertheless the working principle of displacement ventilations relies completely on the existence of internal heat sources, i.e. occupancy. Hence it is very important to study aerosol transport by displacement ventilation with internal heat sources. In the present work, measurements and numerical simulations of contaminant particle concentration evolution in a mechanically ventilated room with heated sources have been carried out. This investigation aims to provide a realistic simulation of the time-dependant flow field in a chamber populated with two heated manikins using the well-resolved LES approach. The potential of both the Lagrangian and the Eulerian approaches coupled to LES of non-isothermal airflow to study dispersion characteristics of expiratory aerosols has been explored.",

However, the aim of this work is twofold: (i) to test the capabilities of the in-house code Code_Saturne to investigate aerosol transport under displacement ventilation with two heated human models using LES, (ii) to compare the aerosol concentration fields computed by both the Lagrangian and the drift-flux Eulerian approaches in the framework of LES, and (iii) to compare the experimental results with model predictions.",

The wall temperature is set to 297 K while the occupant temperature is set to 317 K. One of the occupant is emitting droplets (source) and faces directly the second occupant (receptor).

Two recent reviews have demonstrated the time scale of evaporation. Nicaset et al. [20] and Morawska [21] estimated that the shrinkage time from the original droplet to droplet nuclei is rapid and is in the order of 0.5 s.

Consequently, one cannot seek a grid independent LES, as we usually do for RANS. This is because a grid independent LES is essentially DNS, and the philosophy of LES that is based on grid dependency, looses its meaning. Celik et al. [27] developed a method to assess the quality of LES results. It consists of estimating an index of quality which is a measure of the percentage of the resolved turbulent kinetic energy. They stated that if more than 75% of the kinetic energy is captured, then the LES is considered adequate.

This has many important consequences in terms of modelling. First, the slip velocity between the fluid and the particulate phases can be rigoursly assumed to be negligible allowing the use of the fluid phase velocity as the convective velocity for the particulate matter concentration. For the same reason, the particulate phase mass can be assumed diffused similarly to the fluid phase mass. It is linked to the momentum diffusion through the Schmidt number Sc; \u0393\n = \n\u03bd/Sc with Sc\n = 1. Second, the response time and hence the settling velocity of these small water droplets are small. Still, they can be of a comparable magnitude with the turbulence time scale and convection velocity at least in some regions of the computation domain; near the wall for instance. Hence, this drift phenomenon can be accounted for by (i) adding the settling velocity to the convective term to reflect the drift flux caused by gravity; vs(\u2202C/\u2202xj) and (ii) by considering a deposition flux on surfaces through the sink term S\nc.",

It is noticed that the low momentum cooled air (0.2 m/s) near the floor level absorbs heat from the two occupants and creates a dominant vertical thermal plume in the boundary layer around each occupant.

The x-axis is the elapsed time after the aerosol emission and the y-axis is the dimensionless concentration. It should be noted that unlike Reynolds averaging methods LES gives instantaneous concentrations of particles that are convected by a turbulent flow. All the reported results were measured downstream of the emission point. Hence it can be anticipated that the concentration will decay with elapsed time. Regardless of the modeling approaches or experimental results, first three figures show clear decay profiles. For Fig. 12 where the location is at the exhaust, the result is more complex as both Lagrangian and experimental results depict non-decay profiles. It can be seen that the variation of the experimental measurement at point F is very small which is ranging from 0.01% to 0.07%. Further investigation is required to explain the observation. It is also interested to compare the \u201cdecay\u201d rate for different locations as the decay magnitude should be correlated to the \u201clocal\u201d air velocity. This issue will be addressed in future work. The experimental results were best fitted by an exponential function using the least square method and the corresponding decay rates are shown (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). Inferring from the results Fig. 9, Fig. 10, the decay rates are comparable to each. By taking into account of the uncertainly of the particle counter used which is \u00b112%, the agreement between the experimental results and the computational modeling predictions is acceptable [36]. In this work observable discrepancy between the modeling results by Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches is seen. More experimental results are required to validate the accuracy of the model.",
