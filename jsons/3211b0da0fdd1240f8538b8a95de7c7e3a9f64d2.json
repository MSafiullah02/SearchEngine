With this growing crisis, companies & researchers over the world are looking for the ways to address the challenges of this virus, to mitigate the spread and develop a cure for this disease. In this baffling battle, science and technology is playing a vital role. For example, early in the outbreak when China initiated its response to virus it focused on artificial intelligence (AI) by relying on like facial recognition cameras to track the infected patients with travel history, robots to deliver food and medicines, drones to disinfect public places, to patrol and broadcast audio messages to public encouraging them to stay at home [1] . AI has been used extensively to discover new molecules on the way to find aid for COVID-19. Many researchers are using AI to find new drugs and medicines for the cure, along with some computer science researchers focusing on detecting the infectious patients through medical image processing like X-rays and CT scans [2] . AI is even developing tracking software's like monitoring bracelets that helps in classification of peoples breaching the quarantine rule. Smart phones and AI enhanced thermal cameras are also being used for detecting fever and infected people [3] . Countries like Taiwan infused the national medical insurance database with inputs from the immigration and customs database, hence confronting the coronavirus patients on the basis of their travel history and symptoms [4, 5] .",

AI capacities can be valuable to analyze, predict and clarify (treat) COVID-19 contaminations, and help oversee financial effects. So far, most clinical utilizations of artificial intelligence to the COVID-19 reaction have concentrated on diagnosis dependent on clinical imaging. The quality of the present diagnostic methods at the initial introduction of the disease has been questioned.

Scientists working on AI applications show that it can give extra time to radiologists and do a diagnosis quicker and less expensive than with coronavirus regular tests. For this purpose, the doctors can use X-rays as well as CT scans, Computed Tomography [9] . Table 2 explains different artificial intelligence applications in CT diagnosis of COVID-19. Coronavirus tests are short in supply and costly, however, all emergency clinics have X-Rays (or CT) machines. With the assistance of Deep Learning, radiologists can diagnose COVID-19 using X-ray pictures. COVID-Net an artificial intelligence application is created to analyze COVID-19 symptoms in chest x-rays utilizing information of different lung conditions and COVID-19 from patients [10] . In a diagnostic study, an AI platform was established using inception migration neural network for extracting COVID-19 symptoms using CT images, achieving 89.5% accuracy [11] . An initial detection model was created to recognize COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral pneumonia and sound cases with pulmonary CT pictures utilizing deep learning systems. The patient's infected parts were proportioned by using a 3-D deep learning model. This study showed 86.7% accuracy of the model [12, 13] . Jin et al. developed a deep learning model that can precisely identify corona virus symptoms from the community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other lung diseases. A 3D deep learning framework using chest CT was constructed using a neural network (COV-Net) [14] . For Coronavirus diagnosis; a deep learning model was proposed which straightforwardly accepts CT scans information as input and implements lung division, diagnose COVID-19 and finds abnormal slices. Furthermore, the study trusts that the diagnosis outcomes of AI framework can be quantitatively clarified in the initial picture to mitigate the disadvantage of deep neural systems as a black box [15] . An automated tool was created to quantifying the symptoms of this virus in the lungs of the patient and to observe the growth of the infection or reaction to cure, using a deep learning method. The capability of AI in diagnostics isn't yet practiced, though Chinese hospitals have installed ''AI-assisted\" radiology technology. Reverse. Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests are the key methodology used for diagnosing coronavirus, yet they have restrictions as far as specimen assortment, time required for the study, and execution [16] . Specific abnormality in images and designs in CT scans showing COVID-19 symptoms has been discovered [17] .",

In lieu of this, a forecast model dependent on the XGBoost calculation was made to predict mortality risk and distinguish key features which can be estimated in clinics. The researchers found out three key clinical pointers (lactic dehydrogenase, lymphocyte and high-affectability C-receptive protein) for assessing a patient's mortality. A plus point of this method is its interpretability, the three indicators identified by the methodology correspond to the most significant factors in the pathophysiological progress of COVID-19, specifically cell injury, cell immunity, and inflammation [28] . A corresponding report meant to forecast if existing COVID-19 patients would require a long stay in hospitals or not, based on a U-Net subsidiary trained on CT imaging data [29] . These two methodologies can help in recognizing the patients that may require escalated and long-term care, helping clinics deal more adequately. At last, while both of these investigations were constrained in scope and information, they establish significant roads of research that can be supplemented and stretched out with clinical information from approaching cases the world over.",

Apart from that, the Facebook promotions with content identified with the infection is analyzed. The Facebook Ad Library [40] scans all commercials utilizing the catchphrases \"coronavirus\" and \"COVID-19\" and gathered 923 outcomes across 34 nations, with most in the US (39%) and the EU (Italy made up 25% of the ad showcases). A system for COVID-19 detection utilizing information found from smartphones' sensors, for example, cameras, microphones, temperature and inertial sensors is proposed in [41] . On the other hand, sound information received from a cell phone's microphone is utilized for cough type detection [42] . This information is significant for AI calculations to learn and foresee the contamination threat of every being, subsequently helping in early identification of high-risk cases for quarantine purpose, thus diminishing the spread of the infection to the helpless populations [43] . A few drones are utilized to trail people, not applying facemasks, while others are utilized to broadcast information to bigger crowds and furthermore to sanitize open spaces. Small-Multi-Copter [44], a Shenzhen-based innovation, has assisted with decreasing the infection transmission hazard in city-wide transport of clinical supplies and quarantine materials through drones. To battle the spread of the novel coronavirus spread in India, the administrations launched Aarogya Setu [45] mobile application that trails coronavirus cases around and helps in battling the infection on an individual level.
