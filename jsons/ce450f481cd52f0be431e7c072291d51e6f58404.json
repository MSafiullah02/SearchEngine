To determine the important role in the innate immune response of cells within the airways, especially the airway epithelium: macrophages, dendritic cells and CD8 lymphocytes. studies undertaken in the 1960s identified many of the viruses responsible for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), 1 it was only with the advent of sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques that it was determined which viruses were responsible for the majority of URTIs and the viruses identified in population studies. 2, 3 Human rhinoviruses (RVs) have consistently been found to be the most frequent cause of URTIs (30-50% of cases), followed by coronaviruses (10-15%), with parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and enteroviruses in 5% of cases or less. 1,2 Influenza virus causes 5-15% of viral respiratory infections and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 5-10%; these two viruses appear to have the capacity to cause more serious disease (see below). 1 Recently, human metapneumovirus has been identified as a pathogen in humans and is thought to account for up to 6% of all URTIs in young children. 4 Despite the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 20-30% of URTIs a pathogen cannot be identified. A more recent advance in viral diagnostics is the application of DNA microarray technology, which allows researchers to assess individuals with URTIs for all known viruses. 5 Using this technology in a community study of adults, RVs were still found to predominate, but a much greater diversity in both RVs and coronaviruses was found to cause disease than had been anticipated. 6 For the most part these viruses result in a syndrome of rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, pharyngitis and cough. 1 They affect children 6-8 times per year and adults 2-4 times per year. 7 In temperate climates RV infection occurs throughout the year but peaks in autumn and spring, whilst RSV and influenza tend to cause disease clusters in winter. 1 In an immunocompetent host, with the exception of influenza, these viruses lead to a disease confined to the respiratory tract, which may be complicated by otitis media and sinusitis, and rarely predispose to the development of bacterial pneumonia. 1 Experimental studies have shown that RV infects airway epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract but this leads to no discernable damage to the epithelium, though it does result in vasodilatation, increased vascular permeability and an influx of neutrophils. 8 Symptom severity has also been found to correlate with the release of interleukin (IL)-8 and the influx of neutrophils. 9 Influenza and RSV both cause a URTI syndrome but appear to have a greater capacity to infect the lower respiratory tract. RSV is the leading cause of bronchiolitis in infants, 10 but is also increasingly being recognized as a disease of adults, especially the elderly and those with chronic lung disease. 11 Infection targets the lower airway epithelial cells with resulting cytolysis of these cells due to direct viral effects and the resulting lymphocytic and neutrophilic inflammatory response. 12 Influenza is similar in its propensity to infect the lower respiratory tract and, whilst it generally causes a self-limiting URTI, it occupies a unique place among respiratory tract viruses in its ability to cause a devastating respiratory illness and death, even in previously healthy individuals. This phenomenon occurs through a complex interaction of host susceptibility, including previous recognition by the adaptive immune response, and viral virulence. 13 Even limited endobronchial infection with influenza leads to extensive damage to the epithelium. 14 Of all the viruses, influenza appears the best able to avoid the innate immune response in the airways with the potential consequence of severe respiratory symptoms and systemic inflammation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 749, "end": 750, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 954, "end": 956, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 957, "end": 958, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1386, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1534, "end": 1535, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1813, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2019, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2130, "end": 2131, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2203, "end": 2204, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2366, "end": 2367, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2617, "end": 2618, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2884, "end": 2885, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3006, "end": 3007, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3313, "end": 3315, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3506, "end": 3508, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3970, "end": 3972, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "EDUCATIONAL AIMS"}, {"text": "Viral respiratory infections have a major impact in individuals with chronic airways diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

TLR-3 is expressed in intracellular endosomes of bronchial epithelial cells (BECs), macrophages, DCs and CD8 + effector lymphocytes. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] TLR-3 responds to the presence of double-stranded (ds)RNA, 34 which forms as a product of the replication of the majority of RNA viruses, including picornaviruses, RSV and influenza A. 35 Signalling through TLR-3 is dependent on binding with the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor (TRIF). 29 This leads to phosphorylation of the interferon response factor (IRF)-3, which forms a dimer and translocates to the nucleus, resulting in the expression of IFN-b (Fig. 1 ). 36 Signalling can also occur that leads to the translocation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) to the nucleus and results in the release of inflammatory cytokines. 36 TLR-3 is known to play a crucial role in viral recognition by DCs and their release of antiviral type 1 interferons (IFNs). 37 TLR-7/8 are also found within endosomes and their activation by single-stranded (ss)RNA signals through a MyD88-dependent pathway leads to the translocation of NF-kB, activating protein (AP)-1 and IRF-7; the latter is responsible for release of IFN-a (Fig. 1 ). 38 Again, TLR-7 and IRF-7 are strongly expressed by DCs. 37 TLR-4 is among the best characterized of the TLRs and, like TLR-2, is expressed on the cell surface.

TLR-4 has been found to interact with the F protein of RSV, and is able to signal via both MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways and to activate a response via IRF-3, NF-kB and AP-1. 38 The RNA helicases, MDA-5 and RIG-I, are present in the cytosol and detect intracellular dsRNA and ssRNA downstream to initiate type 1 IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. 38 MDA-5 and RIG-I detect different groups of RNA viruses; MDA-5 detects picornavirus and is critical in regulating type 1 IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription, 39 whilst RIG-I detects negativesense ssRNA viruses, such as RSV and influenza virus, and appears to be very important in the antiviral response of non-myeloid cells to infection with these viruses. 39 Interestingly, RIG-I appears less important in the antiviral response of plasmacytoid DCs. 38 Apart from the responsiveness of these helicases, the differences in the structure and mechanism of their action are poorly understood. Binding of viral RNA is expected to occur at the helicase domains, but there are important differences as to how they are activated, e.g. RIG-I responds to the synthetic dsRNA analogue polyI:C, whereas MDA-5 does not, and the uniqueness of these domains and the resulting preferential actions of these RNA helicases remains to be determined.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 247, "end": 251, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 252, "end": 256, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 257, "end": 261, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 262, "end": 266, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 267, "end": 271, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 331, "end": 333, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 457, "end": 459, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 577, "end": 579, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 754, "end": 756, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 918, "end": 920, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1047, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1312, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1367, "end": 1369, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1756, "end": 1758, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1939, "end": 1941, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2111, "end": 2113, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2310, "end": 2312, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2404, "end": 2406, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 743, "end": 750, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1306, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "DETECTING AND RESPONDING TO VIRAL INFECTION Pathogen recognition receptors"}, {"text": "IFNs were among the first antiviral agents to be characterized and are still seen to be central in the early antiviral response, inducing in infected cells and their neighbours an antiviral state. In addition, it is now recognized that IFNs are important regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses, as well as regulating cell growth and viability. 40 IFNs have been subdivided into groups according to the receptors with which they interact. Type 1 IFNs, which include IFN-a and -b, interfere with viral replication and spread. In BECs, fibroblasts, DCs and macrophages infected with viruses, the type 1 IFNs are transcribed upon signalling from TLRs and RNA helicases, as described above. The only type 2 IFN, IFN-g, is an important cytokine which characterizes traditional Th-1 adaptive immune responses released by natural killer, CD4 and CD8 T cells. 40 The IFNs mediate their effects through the induction of hundreds of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), the actions of many of which remain unknown. Induction of IFN-b and select IFN-a subtypes (a2, 4, 5 and 6) occurs early after virus infection and is regulated by phosphorylation of IRF-3. 41 The other IFN-a genes require synthesis of IRF-7 to be activated and this occurs as a more delayed response requiring a positive feedback signal via the early release of IFN-b/a to lead to the full induction of ISGs. 41 Negative regulation of these responses occurs via suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS), especially SOCS-1, which is induced by IFN-a and IFN-g. 42 . This leads to phosphorylation of IRF-3 which forms a homodimer and translocates to the nucleus, resulting in the expression of IFN-b. Signalling can also occur that leads to the translocation of NF-kB. TLR-4 is expressed on the surface of cells and recognizes bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide and the F protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). TLR-4 is able to signal via both MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways and is able to activate a response via IRF-3, NF-kB and activating protein (AP)-1. TLR-7 is found within endosomes and is activated by single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). TLR-9 is also found within endosomes and is activated by unmethylated CpG dsRNA. Both TLR-7 and -9 signal through a MyD88-dependent pathway, leading to the translocation of NF-kB, AP-1 and IRF-7, and the latter is responsible for release of IFN-a. The IFNs mediate their effects through the induction of hundreds of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), the actions of many of which remain unknown. Induction of IFN-b and IFN-a4 occurs early after virus infection and is regulated by phosphorylation of IRF-3. The other IFN-a genes require synthesis of IRF-7 to lead to their activation and this occurs as a more delayed response requiring a positive feedback signal via the early release of IFN-b/a4 to lead to the full induction of ISGs. Release of type 1 IFNs can be recognized by infected and neighbouring cells and type 1 IFNs exert their actions through specific receptors (IFN receptor-a1/a2). Receptor engagement leads to activation of the IFN stimulated regulatory factor (ISGF)-3 comprised of members of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-1 and -2, as well as IRF-9. This complex can directly bind in the nucleus to the IFN stimulated response element, leading to transcription of type 1 IFNs as well as ISGs, especially the antiviral proteins: protein kinase receptor (PKR), RNAse-I and 2 0 ,5 000 oligoadenylate synthetase, and myxovirus resistance proteins (MxA).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 356, "end": 358, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 863, "end": 865, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1153, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1373, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Type 1 interferons and interferon stimulated genes"}, {"text": "Type 1 IFNs exert their actions through specific receptors (IFN receptor-a1/a2).

Myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are derived from progenitor cells produced by the bone marrow and mature into conventional DCs (cDCs). The mDCs and pDCs are phenotypically and functionally different, with pDCs migrating through small blood vessels, surveying for microbial presence, 61 whilst mDCs migrate though the lymphatics and into lymph nodes where they act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). 62 Plasmacytoid DCs are prominent innate responders, strongly expressing TLR-7 and -9, 63, 64 and are capable of quickly producing type 1 IFNs at levels 1000 times greater than any other leucocyte, and for this reason they are thought to have the potential greatly to influence the initial innate immune response to viral infection. 65 These immature DCs also appear to have a high degree of plasticity. When pDCs harvested from the bone marrow of LMCVinfected mice were cultured for 4 days there was a transformation of pDCs into mDCs. This was dependent on viral replication and was seen by a downregulation of pDC markers and the development of the mDC phenotype; an increase in cell size and granularity, and myeloid marker expression. 62 This transformed population of mDCs also switched functional states, achieving a heightened antigen-presenting capacity, an enhanced ability to stimulate na\u00efve T cells and the ability to signal through TLR-4. 62 In an important recent study using a knock-in mouse that was made to express green fluorescence protein (GFP) under the control of IFN-a6, the in vivo response to systemic and intranasal viral infection was assessed. 66 Intranasal infection with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) led to GFP expression in alveolar macrophages (AMs) and cDCs as the first line of antiviral defence. This initial activation was mediated by RNA helicases with AM localized to the lungs and cDCs migrating to regional lymph nodes and producing IFNs. However, when AMs were depleted there was a marked defect in viral elimination evident and an IFN response. It was then seen that pDCs became GFP positive and localized to the lung interstitium, producing a delayed yet quantitatively similar IFN response via TLR-3 activation.

Cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) are classically part of the adaptive immunity. This requires the development of a cohort of CD8 cells that recognize specific viral epitopes and infected cells, and selectively target them for elimination. Whilst this is a highly effective and specific system, it requires time to mount an effective adaptive response. Recent evidence now suggests that proliferating memory CD8 + lymphocytes activated for other reasons can provide an early source of IFN-g acting in a non-specific bystander role. 67, 68 This early source of IFN-g comes from CD44 high CD8 + lymphocytes through mechanisms which are independent of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and cannot be generated by na\u00efve T cells. 69, 70 It was shown that CD8 effector cells from mice could be activated by LPS via TLR-4 and by PolyI:C via TLR-3, leading to the release of IFN-g without a specific TCR-mediated response. 70 Evidence suggests this innate activation is highly influenced by cytokines secreted by APCs; DCs, macrophages and epithelial cells. When these cells release IL-12, IL-18 and IFN-a/b, an antiviral response is stimulated, whilst IL-15 assists in the development of memory phenotype of CD8 + lymphocytes. [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] In fact, IL-15 enhances IL-12 and IL-18's ability to induce IFN-g and increases the sensitivity of CD8 + lymphocytes to stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokines. 73 This non-specific activation of CD8 also appears to be important in vivo. In a mouse deficient in IFN-g, infection with Listeria monocytogenes results in significantly heightened mortality; however, if the mouse is sensitized to ovalbumin prior to infection, it can respond with an adequate IFN-g response and this results in reduced organ bacterial counts. 73 Therefore, bystander activated CD8 memory cells may not be redundant inflammatory cells when confronted by an unrecognized virus, but may provide important acute antiviral support as part of the innate immune response.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 679, "end": 682, "text": "67,", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 683, "end": 685, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 864, "end": 867, "text": "69,", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 868, "end": 870, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1056, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1363, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1368, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1369, "end": 1373, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1378, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1379, "end": 1383, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1551, "text": "73", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1910, "end": 1912, "text": "73", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes"}, {"text": "The other crucial effect that CD8 T lymphocytes have on the innate immune response is their ability to suppress tissue damage that may result as a consequence of an overzealous innate immune responses during acute infection. 74 Mice without functional CD4 + and CD8 + lymphocytes (nude mice and Rag-1 knock-out mice) when infected with a sub-lethal dose of the RNA virus (MHV-A59) or exposed to PolyI:C died within 12-24 h post infection and suffered due to a cytokine storm with marked release of TNF-a. 74 This effect was reversed when T cells activated by ovalbumin were replaced and they were found also to limit the inflammation associated with exposure to LPS and PolyI:C.
