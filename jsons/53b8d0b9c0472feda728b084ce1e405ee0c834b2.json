Accordingly, hPIV2 outbreaks occurred in 2009, during the same period as the 2009 influenza A pandemics and accounted for 35.8% of all viral respiratory infections in ARI patients (Figure 1), revealing the need of health professionals to be aware of other respiratory viruses during influenza outbreaks. Of all hPIV-positive hospitalized patients in our study, 74.38% were children younger than 1 year infected with hPIV3, a percentage higher than described in the literature for this age group. 2 This finding is important because nosocomial dissemination have been described for hPIV3, causing high morbidity in neonatal units, 24 therefore it is important to consider hPIV infection in hospitalized pediatric patients. Previous analyses by our group, performed before the inclusion of hPIV1 and 2 in the surveillance protocol in RS, also showed high prevalence of hPIV3 in children young female, and such an incidence of infection becomes similar to the sex as age increases. 27,28 However, because a higher proportion of male is observed among patients with acute respiratory infection, regardless of being hPIV-positive or hPIV-negative, 29 occasional differences in the sex among hPIV-infected patients should consider higher morbidity in males and their susceptibility in displaying symptoms typical of viral respiratory infections. Interestingly, our results differ from others in the literature regarding the sex differences in hospitalized pediatric patients with SARI 27-30 : though most were young males, we observed a higher proportion of young female infected with hPIV.
