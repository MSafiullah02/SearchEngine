As we now know, delays of even a few days made a considerable difference in the spread of COVID19. Since high quality data is scarce or hard to come by early on, decisions may have to be taken based on prior or best available knowledge, experience, intuition, consensus and common sense. Several opportunities to mitigate harm are missed in the initial stages of a crisis (e.g., use of face cover, canceling travel, screening employees and patients) as we tend to rely on traditional models of data and evidence-based decision-making. However, as new information becomes available, a leader has to be flexible to change prior decisions or adopt alternate pathways. A successful leadership team encourages \"outside the box\" thinking to deal with catastrophic events. As the crisis evolves, the successful leader makes nimble and decisive moves and subscribes to a strategy that is iterative. An example in the COVID-19 setting is allocation and use of PPE where recommendations change rapidly based on PPE availability, disease prevalence, and emerging knowledge of viral transmission.",

Prior to COVID, telemedicine was not mainstream in American medicine, despite having been around for more than a decade. However, the rigors of this pandemic have sharply focused the attention of administrators, providers and insurance companies. It is because of telemedicine, that the \"work from home\" platform may finally be adopted in a meaningful way in our medical field, which may have significant implications for reducing provider burnout while enhancing efficiencies in care delivery.",

Decisions will need to be taken regarding a graduated versus more acute ramp up of activities. One example of a post-surge challenge is how to manage the clinical backlog. This will require a formal operational strategy, additional resources and institutional support. It will require creativity, flexibility and the ability of the leadership team to develop innovative approaches to problem solving. New schedules may need to be developed, evening and weekend work shifts may have to be contemplated, and providers may have to work from different locations to allow consolidation of activities and economies of scale. An effective leader will champion these novel solutions, and facilitate in the implementation.",

Building strong relationships with key stakeholders, having a clear understanding of each leader's role in a future crisis, developing effective supply chains and other processes are a few examples. These plans need to be at the divisional, departmental, institutional and regional levels. Key questions to ask would be: How do we ensure that we maximally prepare for known threats? What are the tools? What are the systems in place? What is the playbook? The answers will be unique for each individual scenario, but the exercise has to be undertaken proactively and the basic principles will be the same.",
