            "text": "Backs^ronnd Mucosal exudation of plasma is a non-injurious, physiological response of the aitway rtiicrocitculation to different inllamtnatory processes. The exudative response is similar in the nose and bronchi and exudation occurs iti both allergic asthtna and rhinitis. The cxtidative response is a specific end-organ limclion of the inucosa[ microeirciilation that may be altered in airway diseases. Ohjeetive This study exatnincs the hypothesis of altered responsiveness of the superficial airway tnicrocitculalion to vascular permeability-increasirtg challenges in sustaitied allergic inflammation. Methods Fourteen patients with birch-pollen induced allergic rhinitis were studied for 7 weeks during a Swedish birch-pollen seasoti. Nasal symptoms (itching, snee/ing. blockage, atid discharge) were recorded and the occurrence of pollen was determined. The plasma exudation response was examined by topical histamine challenges at the etid (May) and well out of (Decetnber) the seasoti. Challenge and lavage were carried out concotiittantly using a 'tiasal pooT-device. The utiilatcral nasal cavity was tilled for consecutive 10 minute periods with saline and two concentrations of histamine (80//g niL and 40()//gmL). The lavage fluid levels of different-sized plastna proteins (albumin-66000D. fihrinogen-340000D. and ormacroglobulin-725 0()UD) were detemiined. Results The pollen season was mild resulting in only minor nasal symptoms. Histatnine produced exudation of all plastna proteins across the microvascular epithelial barriers with particularly strong correlation between the levels of albumin and <>2-tnacroglobulin (r = 0 9S: P < 0 00!). The exudative response to histamine was concentration-dependent (P<0 05) and. furthermore, it was significantly greater late into the season compared with outside the pollen season (albumin: P < 0 05. hbrinogen: P<{)()5. n.-macroglobulin: /'<001). Conelusion We conclude that histamine produced concentratioti-depetident nasal airway exudation of bulk plasma in subjects with seasonal rhinitis and that this response is abnortnally great during the pollen season. Whether angiogenesis or increased responsivetiess of the microvascular etidothelium may explain this phenomenon now remains unknown. We suggest that a microvascular exudative hyperrespotisiveness may characterize allergic airway disease.",

Topical stimulation with inllammatory mediators leads to active separation of endothelial cells in the post-capillary venules. Due to intravascular hydrostatic forces plasma is extravasated through open gaps in the venular wall. For isolated airway tissue expcrimetits it appears that a hydrostatic pressure of about 5 cm H^O. e.xerted on the basoiatera! aspects of epithelial cells, is sufficient to move the plasma macromolecules further across the epithelial lining [10.11] . The luminal entry of plasma is thus already produced by threshold inflammatory challenges, and it may occur without generation of oedema or increased lymph protein transport [17] .

We have even observed that the mucosal absorption permeability is reduced in a subgroup of the present patients (men) during the present pollen season (as assessed with ^ Cr-F,DTA. a small polar solute similar in size to histamine) [20] . We therefore suggest that the increased responsiveness to histamine-challenge in the present study does not reflect increased mucosal absorption permeabilitv but is due to an increased responsiveness of the subepithelial microcircuiation.

We chose two concentrations of histamine. one of which is known to be a significant threshold exudative dose. The other concentration was five times stronger but still submaximal on the steep slope of the concentrationresponse curve [I5|. These concentrations of histamine were kept in direct contact with the nasal mucosa for 10 min which is a sufficient period fbr the exudative response to be fully or almost fully developed [15] . Although there were no changes in baseline levels of the proteins (saline challenge), the exudative response to both concentrations of histamine were significantly increased during seasonal pollen exposure. Subtraction of the baseline values from the histamine challenge values revealed similar results indicating that a shift to the left of the dose-response curve for topical histamine had occurred in seasonal allergic rhinitis. This exudative hyperresponsiveness of the airway microcirculation may reflect changes in the responsiveness of the vascular endothelial cells that regulate the permeability to plasma, or it may be a result of angiogenesis associated with prolonged allergic inllammation. However, whether these possibilities or other explanations are valid remains speculative. The histamine-itiduced nasal symptoms were not significantly increased during this ratber weak pollen season. However, the recording ol symptoms may be a much more coarse method than quantitation of plasma indices by employment of the nasal-pool device which olTers well controlled chailenge-lavage conditions.",

Based on their results of histamine-induccd nasal symptoms, these authors concluded that hyperresponsiveness during the pollen season may be due to an increased baseline (i.e. seasonally induced \"baseline' nasal symptomatology) and not to increased sensitivity to histamine per se. Majchet et al. [21] also measured albumin levels in the nasal lavage fluids after the histamine challenge and made the interesting observation that the histamine response (albumin levels) was higher at the peak than at the end of the pollen season. This particular effect remains unexplained since the authors [21] were not able to find significant changes during any part of the pollen season compared with the histamine-indueed albumin exudation/secretion out of the season. There are a number of aspects which need consideration when our study is compared with that of Majchel et al. [21] . Not only did we examine a weak birch pollen season with quite limited symptomatology, whereas Majchel et al. [21] worked with ragweed-allergic patients, who developed significant symptoms. The methodologies are also distinct. We applied specific concentrations of histamine on a large nasal mucosal surface area while Majchel et al. [21] sprayed different doses of hisiamine into the nostril. The peak output of albumin in our study was also about fivefold greater than that reported by Majchel et al. [21] . We cannot exclude the possibility that this discrepancy in part reflects the efficient washing exclusively of the exposed mucosal surface that is carried out by the present nasal pool device. Furthermore, in the present study we analysed three plasma proteins and could, therefore, secure that the recorded albumin levels reflected mucosal exudation of plasma and not secretory processes.",

As flrst calculated by Hutt and Wick [30] , any increase in the thickness of tissue and surface layers between the bronchial smooth musele and the free airway lumen will in theory result in increased obstructive responsiveness to any bronchial constrictor. The plasma exudation response might increase the thickness of the lamina propria by increasing its content of fluid and matrix macromolecules. Equally, the mucosa! surface layer will be increased by a sticky and tenacious plasma exudate [31] . The exuded plasma also contains numerous proinflammatory peptides, oligoproteins, and proteins. An increased tendency for the exudative lesponse may, therefore, be of significance whether it oecurs in allergic airway disease (this study), common cold [14] or other forms of rhinitis, and in asthma.",
