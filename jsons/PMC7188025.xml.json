NCID is a 330-bed purpose-built facility, and also consists of a screening center, isolation wards, radiology facilities, operating theatres (OTs), and a laboratory.5 NCID is currently the front-line hospital for the screening and management of COVID-19 patients in Singapore.",

In such situations, rapid diagnosis and isolation is imperative to break potential chains of transmission. All HCWs have been issued a real-time location system tag for contact-tracing.
