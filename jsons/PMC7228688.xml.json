The approvals, based on in-vitro investigations and anecdotal clinical data, will probably lead to several worrisome consequences.",

Further investigations highlighted the role of aristolochic acid, a compound found in many traditional herbs.2, 3 Certain batches of an injectable herbal drug called Xiyanping, which is recommended by the Chinese Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol of COVID-19,4 have already been recalled after reports of adverse effects.5 Although these patent herbal drugs have been used clinically for several years, when we apply them to a novel disease like COVID-19, especially in combination with other antivirals, antibiotics, and immune suppressants, the safety should be cautiously evaluated.",

Many traditional medicine practitioners believe that herbal remedies cannot be tested because they are tailored to each individual's syndromes. This argument is simply not convincing. Because the patent herbal drugs are produced in advance of any treatment and their composition is fixed, clinical endpoints including mortality, time to clinical improvement, and number of days in an intensive care unit can be used to evaluate the efficacy of the herbal drugs for COVID-19. Standardised trials might have methodological challenges, consuming time and effort, but that should not be the reason for lowering safety and efficacy standards. Thousands of years of usage and faith cannot be taken as evidence for efficacy of traditional herbs.",

Driven by the claim that some patent herbal drugs can effectively treat COVID-19, some patients with flu symptoms who fear quarantine measures are likely to self-medicate with herbal remedies and avoid going to hospital, thus delaying the proper diagnosis and treatment of the disease, and hampering the government's testing, tracing, and quarantining efforts. At the end of January, 2020, rumours circulating on social media suggested that a patent herbal drug called Shuanghuanglian, which contains honeysuckle and forsythia and is used routinely in traditional medicine to treat influenza and the common cold, helps ward off or even cure COVID-19.

The attempt to develop rigorously tested drugs from traditional herbal medicine should not be given up. It is the only way to protect our vulnerable patients.",
