Although the principal mode of S. aureus transmission is contact-spread, the contribution of airborne S. aureus to the spread of infection is likely to be greater than is currently recognized, and MRSA is the most frequently isolated airborne microbe (D\u00fcrmaz et al. 2005). Shiomori et al. (2001) also indicated that airborne MRSA may play a role in MRSA colonization in the nasal cavity or in respiratory tract infections. Further studies will be needed to assess the levels of S. aureus, especially MRSA, contamination of air and to develop more effective means of controlling and removing airborne MRSA in the public buildings. However, compared to other countries, there are little extant data about airborne S. aureus or MRSA in China. In this study, the concentration and size distribution of airborne S. aureus (including MRSA) in indoor air of different public buildings in China were investigated. These studies could provide information that is available to improve the current ambient air quality standard (AAQS) and is necessary for reducing indoor air contamination by airborne S. aureus.",

Airborne S. aureus (including MRSA), known as the commonly isolated airborne microbe (D\u00fcrmaz et al. 2005), is investigated in the present study. Our field results demonstrate that both the concentrations of total and respirable airborne S. aureus were the highest in movie theaters and it was the lowest in the university classrooms (Table 2). Previous study showed that the range of mean total concentration of Staphylococcus spp. was 16\u201358 CFU/m3 in Korea public buildings (Kim and Kim 2007). Gandara et al. (2006) reported that the average recovered concentration of the respirable S. aureus in Texas homes was only 15 CFU/m3. The Staphylococcus spp. counts ranged from 55 to 84 CFU/m3 in the present study. Based on these results, the concentration of airborne S. aureus showed inconsistency among different countries. Therefore, it may not be appropriate to apply foreign data directly to hygienic management guideline of public buildings in China. Therefore, the present study is very necessary. The ratio of respirable to total airborne S. aureus inside the building ranged from 57\u201373 % in the present study, which was higher than the foreign reports that showed a range of 30\u201360 % (DeKoster and Thorne 1995; Pastuszka et al. 2000; Kim and Kim 2007; Kim et al. 2010).",

The studies of S. aureus (including MRSA) strains isolated from clinical specimens, such as sputum, urine, pus or secretions, and blood, have already been reported frequently in China and abroad. Airborne MRSA may play a role in respiratory tract MRSA infections, and measures should be taken to prevent the spread of airborne MRSA (Shiomori et al. 2001). Therefore, the concentration of airborne MRSA was also evaluated in this study. The results showed that mean total concentrations of airborne MRSA were 20\u201333 CFU/m3 in the investigated buildings (Table 2). Considering the previous reports, the mean total of airborne MRSA was 59\u201373 CFU/m3 in bedsheets in surgery unit (Shiomori et al. 2001).",

In humans, aerosol particles \u22645 \u03bcm are capable of reaching deep into the respiratory tract and being deposited in alveolar tissues. Aerosols of this size, as well as larger particles, can be deposited via inertial impaction in the upper airway, where airflow velocity is greatest, at points in the respiratory tract of airflow directional (Kortney et al. 2011). Regardless of the kind of the public buildings, the size distribution of airborne S. aureus (including MRSA) in indoor air is showing the highest collection rate at stage 4 and stage 3, respectively (Figs. 2, 3). The results showed that most of airborne S. aureus in indoor air could deposit in the lower regions of the human respiratory tract. However, the previous study indicated that Staphylococcus spp. showed relatively high collection rates at first (>7.0 \u03bcm) and second (4.7\u20137.0 \u03bcm) stages (Kim and Kim 2007). The size distribution of airborne S. aureus showed inconsistency in the public buildings (Figs. 2, 3), which appears to be due to the indoor environmental condition like everyday indoor activities or the discharge mechanism related to the velocity of air flow near the microbial habitat in the indoor structures (Li and Hou 2003; Kim and Kim 2007). Further research is needed to determine the cause of inconsistency. The distribution of outdoor airborne S. aureus was considerably similar to the indoor distribution and was consistent with the previous results (Di Giorgio et al. 1996; Kim and Kim 2007).",
