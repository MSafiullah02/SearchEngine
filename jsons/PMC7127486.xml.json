Some reports showed that complement activation, which can cause inflammatory cells recruitment to the alveolar-capillary membrane, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALI (Li et al., 2012, Robbins et al., 1987). As one of the complement activation products, C5a is a strong chemoattractant that increases the infiltration of activated neutrophils and macrophages into the pulmonary vasculature, lung interstitium, and alveolar space, resulting in immune response and disruption of the alveolar epithelial barrier (Flierl et al., 2008, Guo and Ward, 2005). Intensive investigations are still needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of ALI, which remains obscure and is generally believed to be associated with over-activation of complement system, the recruitment of leukocyte, and inflammation mediated by inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide (NO), TNF-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 (Naito et al., 2013, Tsai et al., 2014, Xie et al., 2012).",

It has a thin stalk and heart-shaped leaf, and reaches an average length of 15\u201350 cm. It is affluently distributed in the central, southeast and southwest regions of China and is harvested in summer or autumn (Yang and Jiang, 2009, Meng et al., 2009). HC possesses a large range of pharmacological activities, such as antiviral, anti-oxidative effects (Hayashi et al., 1995). During severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in late 2002 to mid-2003, a TCM formula was proposed to general public as a preventive measure by the State Administration of TCM of China. HC was one of the six ingredients in this formula, owing to its abilities to diminish inflammation (Lau et al., 2008, Zhang and Chen, 2008). Some reports showed that polysaccharides from plants possessed the activities of modulating host responses and improving immunity (Graff et al., 2009, Holderness et al., 2011, Lee and Hong, 2011). It is reasonable to presume that polysaccharides extracted from HC may exhibit the inhibitory effects against ALI.",

            "text": "To assure our hypothesis and further make clear the possible mechanisms, LPS was used, a major cell wall component of bacteria and powerful initiators of inflammatory reaction to induce the model in mice. The model established through intratracheal instillation of LPS to mice provides a good experimental model of ALI/ARDS to mimic the inflammatory response in patients (Naito et al., 2013, Xie et al., 2012). Although various factors such as complement activities and inflammatory cells are involved in these responses, LPS recognition by the immune sentinel cells is a vital step to initiate inflammatory process in this model (Akira and Takeda, 2004). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) has been considered to play critical roles in immune system by recognizing microbial pathogens and initiating innate and adaptive immune responses. Of all the TLRs, TLR4 specifically senses LPS and transmits signals to host cells like macrophages, and then triggers signal transduction to up-regulate inflammatory cytokines and therefore causes inflammation (Akira and Takeda, 2004; Deng et al., 2013).",

However, over activation of complement has also been involved in many forms of acute inflammatory, including ALI (Linton and Morgan, 1999). As a kind of complement protein split product, C5a exerts a broad spectrum of functions. C5a appears to contribute to promoting and perpetuating inflammatory reactions. It is also a potent chemoattractant and is implicated in the recruitment of many inflammatory cells like neutrophils and macrophages (Schmid et al., 1997). In our experiment, pre-incubation of HCP inhibited the hemolysis of sensitized sheep erythrocytes when complement was present. Besides, complement deposition was found in LPS-mediated ALI and relevantly treatment with HCP prevented the deposition. These effects indicate that HCP inhibit the activation of complement system in model mice, consequently, suppress the release of various protein split products including C5a, which may probably contribute to the heavy infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in the lung.",

However, the redundant recruitment could lead to the aggregation of macrophages and neutrophils in lungs of ALI mice. As discussed earlier, C5a is one of the most inflammatory peptides among the complement activation products, and has chemotactic activity for monocytes and macrophages. In the experiments, the peritoneal macrophages were cultured and the chemotactic effects in the presence of HCP were investigated. Results showed that C5a induced significant migration and treatment with HCP prevented it, which indicates that HCP could directly inhibit the migration, consequently, might decrease the influx of inflammatory cells in lungs of model mice, leading to the palliation of inflammation.",

            "text": "Alveolar macrophages, a large mononuclear phagocytes located in the alveolar compartment of the lungs, play a critical role to defend the lungs against inflammatory conditions by producing and releasing a numerous of inflammatory mediators (Niesler et al., 2014, Zhao et al., 2006), including cytokines, chemokines, and complement factors. A pro-inflammatory micromilieu can be caused by these mediators (Sharma et al., 2007) which may function as chemoattractants for invading cells or stimulate local cells (Seitz et al., 2010). In addition to suppression of macrophage migration, the beneficial action of HCP in ameliorating ALI in mice is also likely associated with its ability to prevent the overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators in macrophages. High levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1 generated in pathophysiological conditions lead to the development of inflammatory responses and cytotoxicity, which may have direct role in mediating tissue damage (Giebelen et al., 2007). The present study demonstrated that levels of NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 from LPS-stimulated macrophages were clearly suppressed in the presence of HCP in vitro, as was consistent with the reduction in BALF TNF-\u03b1 in LPS-induced ALI mice after HCP treatment. Interestingly, in vitro treatment with HCP markedly elevated IL-10 secretion, a relevant anti-inflammatory cytokine, in the macrophage culture supernatant after LPS administration.",

            "text": "The present study demonstrated that, HCP alone stimulated mild expression of inflammatory cytokines, including NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. However, polysaccharides extracted from natural plant sources such as HC can be easily contaminated by LPS during the isolation process, which may interfere with biological evaluation studies (de Santana et al., 2012). To further investigate whether HCP-induced cytokines expression could be just a consequence of LPS contamination in polysaccharides, the critical experiments were repeated in the presence of PB, a drug that can bind to the lipid A portion of LPS to exclude cell activation by LPS (Coyne and Fenwick, 1993, Stokes et al., 1989). According to our previous study, 30 \u03bcg/ml PB is sufficient to inhibit up to 10 ng/ml LPS, and has no effect on cell viability. This study showed that treatment with PB suppressed but did not completely abolish HCP-induced secretion of these inflammatory mediators. It is reasonable to suggest that it is HCP but not contaminated LPS in HCP that functions to modulate the secretion of macrophages. Taking the results above into account, HCP decreases the LPS-induced excessive production of NO and cytokines in inflammatory condition but enhances the immunologic functions in physiologic level. This phenomenon demonstrates that HCP may have biphasic actions.",
