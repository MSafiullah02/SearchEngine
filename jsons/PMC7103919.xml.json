Six of the top 10 leading causes of death in 2012 were NCDs, including the top three (ischemic heart disease, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The latter two have unseated lung infections and diarrheal diseases from the top 10 since 1990. Over the same period the number of deaths from NCDs has increased from 27 million to 38 million, currently representing 70% of all global mortality [1]. Once confined to a clutch of high-income countries, NCDs are now the leading cause of death in developed and developing countries alike.",
