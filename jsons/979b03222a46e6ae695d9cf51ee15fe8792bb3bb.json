The group is characterized by virions, which are straight tubes of approximately 300 x 18 nm with a 4-nm-diameter hollow canal, made up of about 2000 units of a single structural protein surrounding one molecule of singlestranded RNA of approximately 2 x lo6 Da. Tobamoviruses are widespread throughout the world, generally have wide host ranges, and cause substantial crop losses. No natural vectors have been identified, but these viruses are easily transmitted mechanically and move quickly through crops that are handled; sometimes they are also spread in the soil.",

            "text": "These ORFs do not overlap in the U1, OM, L, and 0 strains, having two or three nucleotides between the ORFs, while those of strains Cc and CGMMV overlap by 26 nucleotides. In all tobamoviruses the ORFs are followed by approximately 200 nucleotides that are not translated. The 126K/183K proteins are thought to be translated from genomic RNAs. These proteins are produced by in. uitro translation of virion RNA, whereas the other proteins are not (Knowland, 1974) . The 30K and coat proteins are translated from subgenomic mRNAs that are produced during replication (Hunter et al., 1976; Siege1 et al., 1976; Bruening et al., 1976; Higgins et al., 1976; Beachy and Zaitlin, 1977) . These mRNAs initiate upstream from the ORFs and continue to the 3' terminus of the genome, but, as with the genomic RNA, only the 5'most ORF is translated. An mRNA for the 54K protein has been found in infected cells associated with polyribosomes (Sulzinski et al., 1985) , but this protein has not been found in uiuo. The coat protein mRNA (corresponding to nucleotides 5703-6395 of TMV-U1) has an eight-or nine-nucleotide leader that is AU rich and has a 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap. The 30K mRNA (nucleotides 4828-6395 of TMV-U1) also contains the coat protein ORF. The 30K mRNA leader is reported to be 65 nucleotides for the OM strain (Watanabe et al., 198413) and 75 nucleotides for the U1 strain . Available evidence suggests that this mRNA is not capped (Hunter et al., 1983; Joshi et al., 1983; . The putative 54K mRNA initiates at nucleotide 3405 of TMV-U1 and continues to the 3' terminus (Sulzinski et al., 1985) . This mRNA has 90 nucleotides upstream from the probable ORF. There is no information concerning whether it is capped.",

The origin of assembly is within the coding sequences of the 30K ORF of some strains (i.e., U1, OM, L, and 01, but within the coat protein ORF of others Ke., Cc and CGMMV). Subgenomic RNAs that contain the origin of assembly are also encapsidated and make up a minor component of the virion population. It is possible that assembly might function in the regulation of gene expression by making mRNAs unavailable for translation. Not only would this remove genomic RNA, which is the message for the 126K and 183K proteins, but also the 54K and 30K mRNAs in all tobamoviruses and the coat protein mRNAs of the Cc and CGMMV strains.",

The m7G cap is added to the 5' end by initiating transcription with the capped dinucleotide, m7Gpp-pG. The cap is required for infectivity when RNA is used as the inoculum , but a low level of infectivity is achieved when the uncapped RNA is assembled into virions prior to inoculation . RNA with a nonmethylated cap is essentially as infectious as that with the methylated cap. A nearly precise 5' sequence is required for infectivity. In contrast, the addition of up to 10 nucleotides to the 3' end has little effect on infectivity. On replication initiated by RNAs with additional nucleotides on either end, the progeny viral RNA does not contain the extra nucleotides.",

Labeling kinetics under numerous different conditions show that RF and RI appear to interconvert rapidly, each being different transient states of the same replicating unit. From short to long labeling periods, the amount of label in each of these doublestranded RNAs is always approximately equal (Kielland-Brandt, 1974 ; W. 0. Dawson, unpublished observations) . Incorporation during longer labeling periods (i.e., 2-4 hours) results in about 90% incorporation into genomic-length single-stranded RNA and about 4-6% each into RF and RI. Free minus-sense strands have not been detected. Genomic RNAs are quickly assembled into virions, and the concentration of free plus-sense strands is never more than a small percentage of the final amount of viral RNA produced (Dawson and Schlegel, 197613) .",

One of the earliest steps is an actinomycin D-sensitive step that occurs prior to viral protein or RNA synthesis (Lockhart and Semancik, 1969; Dawson, 1978) . 2-Thiouracil inhibits a step that occurs later than the actinomycin D-sensitive step, but earlier than viral protein or RNA synthesis (Dawson and Schlegel, 1976a; Dawson and Grantham, 1983) . Ribovirin and low concentrations of guanidine inhibit with the same kinetics and might inhibit the same process (Dawson, 1975; Dawson and Lozoya-Saldana, 1984) . Cycloheximide and arabinofuranosyladenine inhibit a later step that coincides with protein and RNA syntheses (Dawson and Schiegel, 1976a; Dawson and Lozoya-Saldana, 1986) . When added to an infection in which virus replication is at the maximal rate, arabinofaranosyladenine inhibits the syntheses of single-stranded, but not double-stranded, RNA and viral proteins. These experiments emphasize that there must be viral functions for which we have not been able to associate biochemical events and that at least two inhibitor-sensitive functions occur before viral protein and RNA syntheses.",

In young rapidly growing plants the virus infection spreads from individual cells to almost all other cells. Within an inoculated leaf the infection spreads from initially infected cells to other cells of the leaf both by cell-to-cell movement through plasmodesmata and by long-distance movement in vascular tissues. Free-RNA mutants can move from cell to cell as well as wild-type virus . However, the coat protein greatly facilitates long-distance movement. This can be seen clearly by examining free-RNA mutants in inoculated leaves. Infection by the free-RNA mutants proceeds radially at the same rate as by wild-type virus, but wild-type virus spreads quickly to distant parts of the inoculated leaf and fully infects the leaf within 10-12 days, whereas the free-RNA mutant will have moved only 2-3 cm. After about 2 days infectious virus begins moving via phloem cells into the rest of the plant, utilizing both cell-to-cell and long-distance movement.",

The movement function can be provided by other unrelated viruses (Dodds and Hamilton, 1972; Malyshenko et al., 1988) , and the tobamovirus 30K protein can mediate movement of other viruses. Transgenic plants expressing the 30K protein allow the movement of both TMV mutants with a defective 30K gene (Deom et al., 1987) and some other unrelated viruses (C. Holt and R. N.

This mutant has two nucleotide substitutions, which result in amino acid changes Gln-979 to Glu and His-984 to Tyr within the D2 domain of the 126K and 183K proteins . One possibility is that this viral protein must interact with a host protein to form the replicase complex and the Tm-1 allele encodes that host protein. The host protein in plants without the Tm-1 allele might interact with the wild-type replicase, but the replicase must be altered to function with the Tm-1 protein. In heterozygous (Tm-l/+) plants there might be reduced amounts of host protein with which the wild-type virus protein can interact.",

These results suggest that the first set of mutants, at the restrictive temperature, lost a function required for the synthesis of all RNAs. It is possible that these mutants had a defect in the D3 domain for polymerization. The second set of mutants was capable of synthesizing double-stranded, but not single-stranded, RNA; perhaps these mutants were defective, at the nonpermissive temperature, in a function that regulates plussense-minus-sense RNA ratios or is required to initiate plus-sense strands at the 3' terminus of minus-sense strands.

Theoretically, after infection the 126K and 183K proteins should be produced first to provide the replicase complexes required to produce subgenomic RNAs for the syntheses of 30K and coat proteins. However, because RNA viruses replicate by self-saturation kinetics, in which initial progeny RNAs become templates for new replication centers, even within a single cell, replication does not occur synchronously and transcription of the infecting RNA producing only 126K and 183K proteins has not been detected. In practice, all of the viral proteins are detected initially at about the same time, usually between 3 (Watanabe et al., 1984a) and 7 (Siegel et al., 1978) hours after infection. The syntheses of 126K, 183K, and coat proteins reach maximal rates at 16-24 hours. After a sharp peak of maximal synthesis that lasts for only a few hours, the rates of synthesis of 126K and 183K proteins begin declining and reach a low level by 72-96 hours. In contrast, synthesis of the coat protein continues at maximal rates for more than 40 hours. However, during the course of infection, the relative proportions of these proteins vary. Initially, the coat protein is produced at approximately onehalf the rate of the 126K protein, but at 70 hours coat protein synthesis exceeds that of the 126K protein by 20-fold (Siegel et al., 1978; Ogawa and Sakai, 1984) .",

Bromoviruses replicase preparations are able to initiate the synthesis of subgenomic RNA 4 from a specific internal promoter sequence on the full-length minus-sense RNA (Miller et al., 1985) . The replicase recognizes a specific sequence on this RNA to initiate synthesis of the subgenomic RNA.

The KK6 30K protein mRNA leader contained the sequences of the coat protein mRNA, as would be expected if promoted by the coat protein promoter. Additionally, it contained nine extra nucleotides from the XhoI site created to make the construct and six extra nucleotides added because the subgenomic RNA was initiated six nucleotides upstream from the normal coat protein mRNA initiation site. Another difference between the wild-type 30K and coat protein mRNAs is that the latter is capped, while the former is not. What determines whether a virus RNA becomes capped is not known. In fact, we do not know how cytoplasmic viruses such as TMV are capped, since host enzymes involved in this process are thought to be limited to the nucleus. Possible controls of capping of the TMV RNAs are the subgenomic RNA promoter and leader. However, the new 30K protein mRNA of KK6 that was initiated by the coat protein subgenomic RNA promoter and contained a hybrid coat protein mRNA leader was not capped (Lehto et al., 1990~ ).

We do not know whether the delay of 30K protein synthesis by mutant KK6 is due primarily to the inserted promoter with delayed transcription of the mRNA or the modified leader, resulting in translational regulation, or both. Determining whether insertion of the 30K promoter/leader sequence in front of the coat protein ORF will cause the coat protein to become an early product is important. It is possible that the sequences upstream from each of the internal (i.e., 54K, 30K, and coat protein) ORFs determine their times of expression during infection.",

An attenuated strain of TMV-L was isolated that is produced in reduced amounts in tomato plants and induces only mild symptoms. However, this virus replicates like wild-type virus in protoplasts (Nishiguchi et al., 1982) . Sequencing demonstrated that the attenuated strain differed from TMV-L by 10 nucleotides within the 126K gene, three of which result in amino acid substitutions, one in the D1 domain and two in the D2 domain (Nishiguchi et al., 1985) . During replication in protoplasts, the synthesis of the 30K protein and its mRNA are specifically reduced in isolate L,,A, which has all three amino acid alterations, but the reduction is less in isolate Lll, which has only the D1 alteration . Syntheses of genomic RNA, coat protein mRNA, and 126K, 183K, and coat proteins were not reduced. This finding suggests that alterations in these domains of the 126K protein can be involved in the production of 30K protein, but not coat protein, mRNA. If so, the specific subgenomic RNA promoters are recognized independently.",

When mutants with different sizes of deletions in their coat protein genes were examined, the increased production of the 30K protein was always proportional to the number of nucleotides removed, demonstrating that the position of the 30K gene determines its level of expression. The level of expression was affected little by which promoter/leader sequence controlled the gene. This suggests that one reason the coat protein is produced in greater amounts than the 30K protein is because of their relative positions to the 3' terminus. The same logic suggests that the 54K protein, if it exists, would be produced in amounts proportionally less than the 30K protein. This argument is consistent with the observation by French and Ahlquist (1988) , who showed that the level of production of subgenomic RNA from bromovirus RNA 3 was progressively greater when the promoter was inserted into different positions nearer the 3' terminus.",

The final accumulation of the 30K protein of KK6 was equal to that of wild-type TMV, but mutant KK6 local lesions in inoculated leaves were much smaller than wild-type lesions and KK6 moved more slowly and to only limited areas in upper leaves. The movement defect of KK6 was due to to delayed production of the 30K protein, rather than to reduced levels, which suggests that the 30K protein is needed during the early hours of the replication cycle to properly mediate cellto-cell movement.",

Examples of similar viruses that express genes via subgenomic mRNAs that have different genome organizations are shown in Fig. 4 . We have little understanding of why the particular genomic structure of tobamoviruses arose. Within the tobamoviruses we have established that different types of reg- ulation exist, but our understanding of regulatory mechanisms is meager. However, we have observed enough to make it tempting to speculate on the relationships of RNA virus genomic organizations to the regulation of gene expression.",

In most of these viruses, the structural protein gene(s) is positioned at the 3' terminus of the genome (Fig. 4) . Tobamovirus genes expressed via subgenomic mRNAs appear to be expressed in increasing amounts when positioned nearer the 3' terminus. This has similarities to rhabdovirus transcriptional regulation, in which amounts of transcript are progressively decreased as genes are positioned farther from the genomic 3' end (see Banerjee, 1987) . If this observation can be extended to other virus groups (e.g., tobraviruses), the 16K gene which is positioned at the 3' terminus (Fig. 4) should be expressed in greater amounts than the movement protein, as recently demonstrated (Angenent et al., 1989) . Tombusviruses (Fig. 4) do not have their coat protein genes positioned at the 3' terminus, and whether their 3' genes are expressed at higher levels than their coat protein genes remains to be seen. Tombusviruses and carmoviruses (Fig. 4) appear to be similar, except for their gene order (Carrington et al., 1989; Rochon and Tremaine, 1989 ). Do they differ in levels of expression of the coat protein? What advantages do each of these genome organizations provide? We have only begun to understand the regulation of RNA viruses and how it relates to the evolution of genome organizations.",
