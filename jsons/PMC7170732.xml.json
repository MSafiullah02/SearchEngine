It has since spread globally, with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. With its basic reproduction number close to or higher than SARS-CoV [3, 4] and MERS-CoV [5], COVID-19 represents a potentially higher pandemic risk than the SARS outbreak in 2003 [6]. Initial cases of zoonotic transmission from bats [7] have since evolved into human-to-human transmission through droplets, fomites [8], fecal material [9], and tears [10]. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in tears and conjunctival secretions of infected patients with conjunctivitis [10], similar to findings during the 2003 SARS outbreak [11], suggests a unique risk to the ophthalmology department.",

With a usual patient load of 600 patients per day, the risk of COVID-19 transmission is imminent and catastrophic. Furthermore, ophthalmology is a unique practice requiring routine use of reusable equipment in close contact with patients and with many high-risk high-touch surfaces [17], thereby increasing the risk of disease transmission among ophthalmology patients. Examples include the Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT) heads, slit lamp, contact lenses, eye drops, chin-rests, and table surfaces of ophthalmic diagnostic and laser devices such as the Humphrey visual field and optical coherence tomography. This, coupled with the fact that Coronaviruses can survive up to 96 h in biological fluids and in high relative humidity and low temperature [18], thus makes contaminated surfaces key sources of iatrogenic transmission of infections [19\u201322] between patients [11, 23].",

In a rapidly evolving or complex healthcare crisis, in addition to e-mails, communication can be supplemented with widely used smartphone messaging applications such as WhatsApp and Telegram. The benefit is that unlike short message service (SMS), which only allows single person interactions, modern messaging apps allow large group chats. This facilitates fast large group dissemination of information, consultation, coordination, and action. Many functional social-level group chats may already exist and should be tapped on, for example administrative, resident, nursing, or ophthalmic technician groups. A situational crisis group for COVID-19 may comprise key stakeholders for decision-making in a clinic or department and leaders from different functional groups. Such chats also serve as a temporary resource of relevant information, where documents and protocols can be attached. Larger organizations may even have approved secure instant messaging applications like the TigerConnect, and organizational policies may dictate that only these be used.",

Hence, the psychological welfare of staff must not be neglected. Assistance in this regard could be sought from affiliated psychiatry or psychology departments or colleagues. Staff could be taught self-help methods on coping with stress and increasing resilience. Avenues for seeking help should be made known to all staff so that those experiencing an acute stress reaction can seek help. A 3S (Staff Support Staff) framework could also be instituted where fellow staff members help look out for signs in colleagues and are trained to provide informal psychological support. These efforts should persevere beyond the resolution of COVID-19.",
