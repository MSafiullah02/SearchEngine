The primary objectives of treatment of acute infectious diarrhoea are correction of dehydration with oral replacement therapy (ORT) and maintenance of good nutritional status via food intake. With regards drug therapy antimicrobial agents are not usually recommended since the disease is generally self-limiting.

Estimates of mortality in developing countries based on studies published between 1992 and 2000 showed a median mortality of 4.9 children per 1000 per year in the first 5 years of life. Overall, in this cohort of children, diarrhoea accounted for 21% of all deaths, which represents between 1.5 and 2.5 million deaths per year, and the risk is greatest among children under 1 year of age (3) . In contrast, deaths from diarrhoea are uncommon in industrialized countries, but the disease remains an important cause of morbidity and incurs substantial healthcare costs (4) . It has been estimated that 1 in 40-50 children <5 years of age with serogroup A rotavirus infection requires hospital admission for the control of diarrhoea or treatment of related complications (5, 6) . In addition to the direct health burden, consequences of diarrhoea include possible malnutrition, diminished growth and impaired cognitive development (7, 8) .",

About 50-80% of episodes are caused by viruses, most notably rotaviruses or noroviruses, which are the leading cause of severe, dehydrating gastroenteritis among children (9, 10) . Children infected with rotavirus may experience 10-20 bowel movements per day and vomiting for periods of 24 h or longer; consequently, dehydration is a major concern. Young children are particularly at risk of dehydration because of their higher surface-to-volume ratio, higher metabolic rate, smaller fluid reserves and their dependency on others for fluid intake. Rotavirus illness is difficult to prevent because it is easily transmitted (e.g. between family members in the home, and between children in preschool or day-care settings); furthermore, children can be infected more than once (11) . Therefore, implementing a vaccination program to protect against more severe subsequent infections represents an ideal means of preventing moderate-tosevere rotavirus infections.",

Rotavirus and other intestinal viruses penetrate into the cytosol of enterocytes in the small bowel. Different pathways are involved depending upon the pathogen, including an effacement-attachment process in the small bowel, invasion of the epithelial layer of the intestinal mucosa usually occurring in the colon, or production of an enterotoxin. A simplified schematic representation of the pathogenetic mechanism of acute infectious diarrhoea is shown in Figure 1 . For example, diarrhoea caused by invasive bacteria such as Shigella spp. is due to the failure of the colon to reabsorb water entering into the colon from the ileus. Enteric viruses cause diarrhoea through different mechanisms, including interference with gastrointestinal motility or damaging the intestinal epithelium and reducing brush border enzymes. The reduction in enzyme levels results in a failure to metabolize dietary carbohydrates with consequent osmotic diarrhoea. As shown in Figure 2 , once rotavirus enters the small intestine, it attaches to glycolipids on the surface of the mature villous tip cells that line the small intestine. The virus invades the villous tip cells, causing villous atrophy, loss of digestive enzymes and a reduction of absorption. Once the villi become blunted, the resulting malabsorption of carbohydrates results in diarrhoea, which persists until the villi are regenerated. In addition, the nonstructural protein (NSP4) has been shown to act as a viral enterotoxin contributing to the pathogenic mechanisms of diarrhoea (15) .",

Other bacterial agents, including Shigella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, EIEC, as well as the protozoa E. histolytica produce cytotoxins that lead to destruction of the intestinal epithelium, resulting in inflammatory diarrhoea. The diarrhoeal stools contain mucus, exudate and bleed and the release of inflammatory mediators stimulates fluid secretion. Hypermotility also results in diarrhoeal fluid losses. Hormones involved in hypermotility of acute infectious gastroenteritis include motilin, neurotensin, cholecystokinin and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP).

Clinical signs of dehydration are detailed in Table 2 . Knowledge of the physiology of fluid balance, particularly intestinal electrolyte and nutrient transport, provides a basis for understanding the mechanisms of acute diarrhoeal disease and the rationale for oral rehydration therapy. Water absorption occurs primarily in the small intestine, driven by osmotic gradients that depend on the transport of the electrolytes sodium and chloride, as well as nutrients such as glucose and amino acids. Sodium, glucose and several amino acids are absorbed through the apical membranes of intestinal epithelial cells by a sodiumdependent nutrient cotransporter system. Sodium is then transported from the cell across the basolateral membrane to the extracellular space by the enzyme Na + /K + -ATPase. This enzyme utilizes energy to reduce the intracellular sodium concentration, which produces a negative extracellular electrical charge. The resultant electrochemical gradient facilitates sodium absorption by the epithelial cell, which drives the sodium-dependent nutrient cotransporters. The anion chloride is absorbed to maintain electrical neutrality across the epithelium, and water is passively absorbed in response to the transport of these electrolytes and nutrients. Successful oral rehydration therapy with balanced sugar-salt solutions depends upon these simple physiologic principles.",

A systematic review of 14 randomized controlled trials to compare ORT and intravenous therapy concluded that there were no clinically important differences between ORT and intravenous therapy in terms of efficacy and safety (32) . In a review of 17 trials comparing oral and intravenous rehydration in children with gastroenteritis, it was calculated that only one in every 25 children (95% CI 14-100) would fail to respond to ORT and then require subsequent intravenous therapy (33) . An algorithm for the management of acute diarrhoeal disease in children is shown in In order to supply a greater number of glucose molecules for cotransport of sodium without causing osmotic overload, an oral rehydration salt solution in which glucose (20 g/L) is replaced by 50-80 g/L of rice powder (with the electrolytes remaining unchanged) has been proposed to reduce stool output and duration of diarrhoea in patients with acute watery diarrhoea. Results from a systematic review indicates that the rice-based oral rehydration appears to be effective in reducing stool output in patients with cholera, but it was not effective in infants and children with noncholera diarrhoea (34) . Other strategies, including supplementation of ORS with partially hydrolyzed guar gum (35) and amylaseresistant starch (36) (substances thought to generate shortchain fatty acids in the colon and these accelerate colonic sodium and fluid absorption) have been shown to reduce stool output and the duration of diarrhoea. Moreover, addition of recombinant human lactoferrin and lysozyme to a rice-based oral rehydration solution had beneficial effects in children with acute diarrhoea (37) . Dietary management with a rice-based diet containing either cooked green banana or pectin, in addition to their known colonotrophic effects, reduced the amount of stool, the need for ORS, and the duration of diarrhoea. It is thought that this effect was mediated by improvement of small intestinal permeability (38, 39) .",

This was despite a large heterogeneity in the trials included in these analyses. However, the authors of these studies concluded that more research is needed to confirm the use of particular probiotic regimens in specific patient groups. Moreover, it has been argued that the beneficial effects of probiotics appear to be limited to a modest decrease in the duration of diarrhoea. In fact, in children less than 2 years of age with moderate to severe dehydrating diarrhoea, ORT plus Lactobacillus rhamnosus CG was no more effective than placebo in reducing the duration or severity of diarrhoea. This suggests that intestinal colonization must occur before benefits of probiotics can be realized (43) . In a recent study, the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii administered as an adjuvant to ORS in ambulatory care in children less than 2 years old with mild or moderate acute diarrhoea decreased the duration of diarrhoea, accelerated recovery and reduced the risk of prolonged diarrhoea (44) .",

At all times, breastfeeding should be continued. Supplementation with ORS to compensate for fluid and electrolyte loss in the stool during continued diarrhoea, as clinically indicated, will further prevent the onset of dehydration. The use of lactose-free formulae in the vast majority of children appears to be unjustified. Interestingly, results of a multicentre study performed in 29 European countries to determine how closely current treatment of acute gastroenteritis complicated by mild-tomoderate dehydration compares with the ESPGHAN recommendations (46) , revealed that a minority of physicians follow the guidelines regarding the use of rapid oral rehydration over 3-4 h, the inadequacy of lactose-free formulae, and the use of ORS to minimize the effects from ongoing fluid loss-associated watery diarrhoea.",

The mechanism of action of racecadotril is shown in Figure 4 . Water and electrolyte transport in the intestinal mucosa is regulated by local messengers (neuropeptides, amines, eicosanoids). Most of them act via the mediation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), activating or inhibiting its production from adenosine triphosphate. An increase in cAMP is induced by endogenous (e.g. VIP, PGE2) or exogenous agents (e.g. V. cholerae, E. coli toxins) and leads to net hypersecretion of water and electrolytes. Opiate neuropeptides are localized in the intestine myenteric and submucosal plexuses, where they modulate motility (mu receptors) and secretion (delta receptors). Activation of mu receptors prolongs intestinal transit while activation of delta receptors reduces intestinal secretion of water and electrolytes. Enkephalins activate delta receptors and inhibit adenylcyclase, thus facilitating a decrease in cAMP levels with a consequent reduction in water and electrolyte secretion. This antisecretory action, however, is brief because enkephalins are rapidly degraded by the membrane pepti- dase enkephalinase. Racecadotril is a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed in man into the active metabolite tiorphan, which is a powerful and selective enkephalinase inhibitor. Thus, the antisecretory action of enkephalins is prolonged in the presence of tiorphan (47, 48) . Furthermore, unlike opiates and loperamide, racecadotril does not act on mu receptors and therefore it does not prolong intestinal transit, nor does it favour bacterial growth in the small intestine (49) .",

No significant differences were found in faecal output or duration of diarrhoea. However, there were differences in tolerance, with a lower incidence of constipation and fewer associated treatment modifications in the racecadotril group. The authors concluded that racecadotril and loperamide were equally effective in treating acute diarrhoea in these children, and racecadotril had a superior tolerability and safety profile.",

Children treated with racecadotril had significantly lower 48-h stool output both in the intent-to-treat data set (45.6% reduction with racecadotril) and in the rotavirus-positive subgroup (46.3% reduction with racecadotril). In patients positive for rotavirus, the duration of diarrhoea was significantly shorter compared with placebo (median 30 h vs. 90 h; p = 0.0001). The intake of ORS was significantly lower in the racecadotril group than in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Racecadotril was well tolerated with only seven patients reporting adverse effects, all of which were mild and transient. This study showed that in young boys with acute watery diarrhoea, racecadotril was an effective and well-tolerated treatment.",

Furthermore, the children receiving racecadotril needed fewer additional emergency department visits to manage the current bout of diarrhoea.

Racecadotril, reduced the duration of acute diarrhoea and stool volume in children aged 3-48 months. The latter outcome is particularly important since quantitative diarrhoea criteria are recommended by the WHO for the evaluation of therapeutic agents in the management of this disorder (55) . None of the studies revealed any significant adverse effects resulting from the administration of racecadotril, although some minor adverse effects were observed. These results apply primarily to hospitalized children; the efficacy of the racecadotril may be different for other subgroups (e.g. outpatients compared with in-patients). The authors of the review concluded that, in three relatively small randomized controlled trials (51-53) with some methodological problems, racecadotril was effective in reducing the volume and frequency of stool output and in reducing the duration of diarrhoea (particularly in infants with rotavirus).",
