            "text": "Influenza viruses are classified as types A, B, and C according to their distinct antigenic properties residing in two major structural proteins (matrix 1 and nucleocapsid) [1]. Recently, a new type of influenza virus with bovine as a primary reservoir, officially designated influenza type D, has been described [2,3]. Among these influenza viruses, only influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV) are of medical importance. It has been well established that humans are the primary host and reservoir of IBV [4,5,6,7], although sporadic infection episodes of IBVs have been described in seals and pigs [8,9]. In contrast, IAV circulates in various mammals including humans, swine, and migratory or domestic waterfowl [1]. IBV infection of humans can result in the same spectrum of clinical disease as IAV, ranging from mild to severe respiratory illness requiring immediate hospitalization and medical treatment [7,10]. IBV-associated mortality has been frequently observed in seasonal influenza epidemics particularly in children and adolescents [11,12], and the rate of mortality can be comparable to IAV [13].",

IBV evolves at an estimated rate of ~2 \u00d7 103 nucleotide substitutions per site per year for hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins [14,15,16]. This evolutionary rate is approximately 2\u20133 times slower than those observed in IAVs. Despite the relatively slow evolutionary rate, new antigenic variants of IBV can emerge, largely driven by genetic reassortment of co-circulating IBV strains [6,17,18]. IBV has evolved into two antigenically and genetically distinct lineages, Yamagata and Victoria [19,20]. The antigenic diversity of IBVs has presented a significant challenge for the selection of an appropriate strain for annual vaccine production.",

            "text": "The global burden of annual influenza epidemics involving IBV, coupled with the increasing strong links between IBV and fatal infections in humans [21,22], calls for an urgent need for more basic and clinical investigations of IBV. Despite significant progress on the characterization of host responses to IAV infections in a range of in vitro cell cultures and in vivo animal models, the interplay between IBV infection and host cells especially human epithelial cells remains poorly understood. A high-resolution analysis of dynamic changes in cellular response following IBV infection is also not available. Of many different cellular response pathways, innate immune response is the first line of defense against viral infection. The innate immune response modulates multiple pathways to signaling viral infection, inducing inflammatory reactions, clearing virus, and presenting viral antigens to the host immune system. It also determines how and when the adaptive immune responses will be activated. Thus, a thorough investigation of the innate immune response to IBV infection will shed light on the pathogenicity of IBV and help understand the severity of influenza syndromes and mechanisms of IBV resistance and disease tolerance. Such studies will also further provide clues on how to interfere or prevent IBV infection in humans.",

Significantly, we observed that the double-stranded RNA sensing pathway, consisting of RIG-I and TLR3, played an essential role in detecting IBV infection. Interestingly, in addition to the antiviral innate immune response, we also found that IBV replication resulted in profound changes in gene transcriptions involving other cellular pathways including immune activation, cellular metabolism, autophagy, apoptosis, mitosis, and cell proliferation. Taken together, these results provide important initial insights into the interactions between IBV and human lung epithelial cells, which pave the way for further investigation of cellular mechanism in restriction or elimination of IBV infections in humans.",

After infection, fresh DMEM with 0.5 \u03bcg/mL tolylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was added for additional 3-day incubation at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2.

Briefly, mRNAs were purified from the total RNA using oligo(dT) magnetic beads followed by fragmentation. The resultant mRNAs were reverse transcribed to cDNAs that were subjected to an end repair process followed by ligation to the adapters. After separation in agarose gel through electrophoresis, cDNA fragments with a size of about 200 bp were excised, extracted, and amplified by PCR using two primers that match the ends of adaptors.

As summarized in Figure 4, our RT-qPCR experiments confirmed the up-regulation of these genes over time (Figure 4a\u2013j), with a significant correlation between RNA-Seq and RT-PCR results (Figure 4k: Pearson correlation r = 0.85; p < 0.0001). Interestingly, we did not observe expression of TLR7 and TLR8 at all time points in A549 cells probably because both genes are not expressed in this cell line as demonstrated in a previous study [33]. Our data suggest that double-strand RNA sensing pathway including RIG-I and TLR3 is rapidly activated following IBV infection, indicating that this pathway is important in induction of the innate immune response to IBV infection in A549 cells. Future study is needed to address a role of single-strand RNA sensing TLR7 and TLR8 in anti-IBV innate immune response.",

Consistent with this, we observed that genes of the JAK-STAT signaling cascade were up regulated including IRF9, STAT1, STAT2, and JAK2, suggesting that the IFN signaling pathway was activated as early as 6 hpi. It is also surprising to observe that although TLR7 was not expressed, downstream genes of TLR7 pathway were up-regulated (MyD88, IRAK, and IRF7) (Figure 3 and Table S1), which indicate there are alternative mechanisms to initiate a similar immune response at the absence of TLR7 molecule in A549 cells. Further analysis showed that both IFN-III and IFN-I pathways were activated as a function of time following IBV infection (Figure 3 and Figure 4). For example, IFN-III family genes such as IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, and IFN-\u03bb3 were constantly expressed over time. IFN-I family genes including IFN-\u03b21, IFN-\u03b120P, IFN-\u03b18, IFN-\u03b12, IFN-\u03b17, IFN-\u03b113) genes, despite relatively low level expressions at earlier time points, were significantly activated at later time points such as 12 hpi and 24 hpi (Figure 3 and Figure 4). Moreover, we did not observe expression of IFN-\u03b3 genes of the IFN II pathway. However, surprisingly, the downstream genes of the IFN II signaling pathways were still up-regulated (Figure 3 and Figure 4), suggesting other genes other than IFN-\u03b3 may also initiate IFN II signaling.",

As summarized in Figure 5, RT-qPCR data showed that only approximately 1.5-fold increase of IRF-3 gene expression was found in infected A549 cells at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively. Despite statistically significant differences of IRF3 gene expression observed at 12 and 24 hpi when compared to 0h hpi (p < 0.01), we viewed that IRF-3 gene expression was slightly increased in A549 cells in response to IBV infection. RT-qPCR data appeared to be in agreement with the RNA-Seq result where we found that the fold-change for IRF-3 when compared to 0h hpi was 1.16 (6 hpi), 1.38 (12 hpi), and 1.14 (24 hpi), respectively (data not shown). For IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b17, similar to what was observed in RNA-Seq experiment (Figure 3), these two genes were not significantly up regulated until 24 hpi (Figure 5).

Host resistance genes improve protection via repressing viral replication with multiple mechanisms, while other genes can modulate disease tolerance by depressing the inflammatory reactions. To understand whether similar mechanisms are used for host resistance and tolerance to IBV infection, we examined the expression levels of reported key regulators in protecting cells from viral infection [36]. Our analysis showed that many genes that are important for repressing viral replication and assembly were up regulated more than 100-fold (Figure 3). Furthermore, the expression levels of some well-characterized antiviral genes were significantly increased to protect cells from IBV infection. For instance, the myxovirus genes (Mx1 and Mx2), which are GTPases that block influenza A virus replication [37,38], were up regulated ~1200-fold at all three time points (Table S1).

Our results generated a number of interesting observations. Upon IBV infection, we observed that both type I and III IFN responses were activated over time, which appeared to be triggered by dsRNA signaling pathways including RIG-I and TLR-3, The activation of RIG-1 and IFN response during IBV infection observed here (Figure 3 and Figure 4) is similar to what has been described in previous studies [46,47]. Furthermore, a robust type III IFN response in infected-A549 cells described in this work was also reported by previous studies in antigen presentation cells [46,47], indicating that type III IFN response may serve as one of the primary antiviral defenses against influenza infection [42].",

Upon activation of IFN signaling pathway, many IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) were transcribed and up regulated in IBV-infected A549 cells. These ISGs further induced inflammatory responses and activated other cellular pathways. Expression and secretion of chemokines such as IL8 would recruit neutrophil to the infection site. Induction of Mx1 protein expression would be expected to mitigate IBV replication.",

            "text": "Further analysis of NGS data also suggests that IBV may somehow interfere with A549 cell proliferation, which is consistent with our in vitro proliferation data reported in our previous work [32]. Previous studies showed that IAV infection arrested A549 cells at the G0/G1 phase [49,50,51], via inhibition of S phase promoting checkpoint proteins. It is assumed that cell cycle arrest can benefit viral replication. For instance, the transcription activity of DNA polymerase II (Pol II), which is required for the transcription of viral proteins, is higher in G0/G1 phase than other phases. The translation of viral proteins requires host-derived cap-dependent translation activity, which is optimal at G0/G1 phase. However, the mechanism of virus mediated host cell cycle arrest is still unclear. One hypothesis is that NS1 of IBV, similar to its counterpart in IAV, down-regulates the expression and activity of the Ras homologue gene family member A (RhoA) kinase [52], a GTPase that is critical for G1/S phase transition. Overexpression of IAV NS1 can cause increased expression of both p27 and p21, which as a result down-regulates the expression of cyclin D [52]. IAV NS1 can also inhibit the catalytic activity of pRb, CDK4, and CDK6, which are important regulators of G1/S check point. In this study, we observed decreased expression of cyclin D2, CDK4, and CDK6, while the expression of p21 was up regulated. These observations are consistent with the above hypothesis, suggesting IBV may use the same mechanism for cell cycle arrest as that reported previously for IAV. Furthermore, the expression of genes functioning in S and M phases are down regulated, implying that IBV infection may slow down cellular processes such as DNA recombination, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation. However, further investigations are required to uncover the mechanisms of these regulations and how these regulations would help IBV to replicate in cells.",

Lacking TLR7/TLR8 molecules apparently prevented us from investigating a function of these viral single-stand RNA recognition receptors for detection of IBV infection. Nevertheless, our study did reveal an important role of TLR3 and RIG-I in sensing IBV genome and triggering the innate immune response in infected A549 cells. Where rapid detection of IBV infection by TLR3 or RIG-1 observed in A549 cells is applicable to other epithelial cells, especially primary human epithelial cells, remains to be studied. In addition, future study also needs to consider employing epithelial cells having a full-spectrum of innate immune activators and regulators rather than TLR7/TLR8-deficient A549 cells. It is also imperative that the antiviral and cellular responses to IBV infection are evaluated in antigen-presentation cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells.",
