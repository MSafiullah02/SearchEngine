Transmission from an asymptomatic patient was reported,8 and higher viral loads were detected soon after symptom onset, with higher viral loads detected in the nose than in the throat.9 The estimated half-life of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols was approximately 1.1 to 1.2 h,10 but it does not necessarily mean the aerosols cannot be filtered by surgical masks or N95 respirators. Endonasal endoscopic surgery is performed in a narrow, longitudinal canal, assisted by suction and irrigation. The chance that aerosols and droplets originating in nostrils escape the suction and are inhaled subsequently by surgeons is rare. Therefore, we think it is not wise to cancel all the endonasal endoscopic surgeries especially the emergency ones, such as pituitary apoplexy, and COVID-19 is supposed to be containable when the surgeries are performed in negative pressure operating rooms with sufficient personal protective equipment and the patients are kept under quarantine postoperatively. While we do not encourage elective surgeries during this pandemic, which might impact patients\u2019 immune system and put them in conditions vulnerable to COVID-19.",
