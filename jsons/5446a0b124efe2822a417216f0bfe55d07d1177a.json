The authors estimated the proportion of positive COVID-19 cases that were asymptomatic to be 30.8% (95% confidence interval: 7.7%, 53.8%). In an April 6 Press Release, the Korean CDC Division of Risk Assessment and International Cooperation reported, \"asymptomatic case proportion is 33.3% based on the presence or absence of symptoms at the time of confirmation. Further analysis is underway based on clinical progress.\" Unfortunately, the press release did not provide details on 1) what proportion of cases were pre-symptomatic and eventually exhibited symptoms and 2) how many positive cases the 33.3% asymptomatic rate was based upon, which would be required for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f calculating a confidence interval of the asymptomatic case rate. The same press release from April 6 stated the overall prevalence of COVID-19 in South Korea at the time as, \"As of 0:00, 6",
