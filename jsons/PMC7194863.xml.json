            "text": "The United Nations has estimated that worldwide 985 million women in 2020 will be aged 50 and over. In 2050 the figure will rise to 1.65 billion. In 2020 the total female population is 3.8 billion and the estimate for 2050 is 4.8 billion [1]. Women\u2019s health issues are often limited to sexual and reproductive issues, whereas sex- and gender differences are relevant to many medical disciplines and all aspects of wellbeing and healthcare [2,3]. The time needed to assess comparable medical diagnoses has been found to be several years earlier in men compared to women. This is in line with the fact that within many European countries the number of unhealthy years with ageing starts earlier in women than in men [4]. As women in general live longer, this importantly affects their quality of life and this poses an enormous medical and economic pressure on society. Frequently used undetermined diagnoses such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and psychosocial distress are typically more often present in women. In addition, as it often happens in clinical practice when there is no clear explanation for certain symptoms in women over 50 years, menopause is frequently used as an overruling container diagnosis. However, we should realize that these container diagnoses are more representative of a lack of knowledge in the medical field rather than of an overkill of unclear symptoms in women. Barriers to regular healthcare, often for economic reasons, are also present in women during their reproductive years, when a solid basis for prevention needs to be set [5].",

Women and men are physiologically importantly different, which is adversely impacted by health disparities related to sociocultural factors. For many women, gender discrimination systematically undermines access to health care, for reasons that include fewer financial resources and constraints on mobility [7]. In addition, poverty, low education level, sexual and domestic violence have a huge impact on cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the traditional risk factors [8]. It has been shown that in countries with a low socio-demographic index (SDI < 0.25), the highest CVD mortality rates shift from men to women [9]. However, even high-income countries continue to face substantial CVD mortality and have reached a plateau in the decline of death from ischemic heart disease over recent years, especially in women. Women with CVD are still considered along the male standard worldwide, leading to misdiagnoses, undertreatment and a lower quality of life (QOL) [10,11].",

Gender norms are the spoken and unspoken rules of societies in accepted behaviors of girls and boys, women and men\u2014how they should act, look, and even think or feel. Gender norms are challenged in families, communities, schools, workplaces, institutions, and the media. These sociocultural expectations start early in life and powerfully shape individuals\u2019 attitudes, opportunities, experiences, and behaviors, with important health consequences throughout the life course [17].",

            "text": "The Lancet women\u2019s commission underscores the need to take actions, also in the health sector itself. Health institutions reinforce gender inequalities both in health-care delivery and in the division of labor in the health workforce. Women are disproportionately socially conditioned into so-called care roles, such as nurse, midwife, and frontline community health worker. The recent global COVID-19 crisis has shown again how important these hard-working women are in patient care. Men are disproportionately represented into so-called cure roles, such as physician and specialist, whereas women are under-represented in jobs with increased pay and leadership positions. Although the majority of the health workforce is female, most women hold positions with little power to change systems, organizations, or their careers, which may lead to work stress, job dissatisfaction, and burnout [16]. With more than 50% female medical students in most countries, they are less likely than men to work in higher paying specialties or to be offered the same opportunities for professional advancement and careers at senior level [18,19]. Among female trainees in cardiology sexist language and behavior is common and often an argument to decide for another sub-speciality [20]. Gender discrimination has a cost in health outcomes because a greater proportion of female physicians in the workforce has been linked to reduced maternal and infant mortality and better treatment of cardiac patients [21] Despite this evidence, analysis of the effect of gender norms on health systems remains neglected. This has been confirmed in a WHO report in March 2019 which emphasizes that women account for the majority (75%) of health and social care workers, but only 25% hold senior roles [22].",
