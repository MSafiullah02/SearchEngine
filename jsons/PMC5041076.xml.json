Comparison of 1D and 2D NMR spectra revealed that compound 19 is a structural isomer of menisdaurin (18) (Fig. 1B, Supplementary information Figs S2\u2013S8 and Table S1)192021. The strong NOE (nuclear overhauser effect) correlations between H-4 and H-5a, H-5a and H-6, and H-6 and H-1\u2019 demonstrate that compound 19 shares the same orientation of H-4 and H-6 with menisdaurin. Additionally, NOE correlations between H-6 and H-7 implied an E-configuration of the C-1/C-7 double bond in compound 191922. The downfield shift of the H-2 signal (calculated as 0.25 ppm) additionally supported the presence of the E-configuration19. Based on the collective data, the structure of 19 was determined as an E-form isomer of menisdaurin (18), designated menisdaurin F.",

Infiltrating neutrophils, thickening of the alveolar wall, lung edema and alveolar hemorrhage are pathological features of ALI1234. Dark red color and morphological swelling of the lung in LPS-induced ALI mice suggested alveolar hemorrhage and edema (Fig. 5A). In addition to hemorrhage, histological examination revealed infiltrating neutrophils and thickening of the alveolar wall in the LPS-treated group. These pathological features were significantly improved following pretreatment with IKWE (500 mg/kg) or 3,5-DCQA (50 mg/kg). Wet/dry (W/D) weight ratio, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and branchalveloar lavage fluid (BALF) were further assessed to confirm the protective effects and determine underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that IKWE and 3,5-DCQA not only improve lung edema but also suppress accumulation of neutrophils in lung tissue (Figs 5B,C and 6A\u2013C). Reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) were additionally observed (Fig. 6D,E), clearly supporting the protective effects of both IKWE and 3,5-DCQA against LPS-induced ALI in mice. Besides, the post-treatment with 3,5-DCQA was performed to further evaluate its effects against LPS-induced ALI in mice24. The results showed that pathological features of ALI were also significantly improved following treatment with 3,5-DCQA (Supplementary information Fig. S12).",

The production of superoxide anions from human neutrophils can be reduced through intracellular mechanisms or ROS scavenging agents430. 3,5-DCQA was previously reported to be a ROS-scavenger and to exert anti-oxidant effects31. The ortho-dihydroxyphenyl moiety significantly promotes ROS scavenging activity via a highly favorable electron acceptance and resonance system3233. Our results showed that all caffeoylquinic acid derivatives, together with CA, RA and THBA, potently inhibit O2.\u2212 generation in neutrophils (Table 2). In contrast, compounds p-CA, 3-HCA and FA were non-active because the ortho-dihydroxyphenyl group was absent. Interestingly, the HNE inhibitory effects of 3,5-DCQA decreased in fMLF-induced neutrophils, which was demonstrated by comparing the results of an enzyme inhibition assay. To eliminate the influence of O2.\u2212 generation, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) was used as an inducer in human neutrophils (Supplementary information Table S2), which led to the recovery of 3,5-DCQA-induced HNE inhibition34. These data confirmed that 3,5-DCQA at a high dose (100 \u03bcM) was able to inhibit elastase release, myeloperoxidase activity and superoxide production in human neutrophils35.",

Previous reports have shown that SFKs are responsible for O2.\u2212 generation and cell migration in fMLF-stimulated neutrophils36. In addition, SFKs have been shown to cause elevated expression of TNF-\u03b1 and chemokines in LPS-induced neutrophils37. These effects have been inhibited effectively by PP2, a highly selective SFK inhibitor3637. Vav, a member of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) family, causes activation of NADPH oxidase by activating Rac38. A previous study revealed that SFKs were able to enhance Vav phosphorylation and activity39. Our immunoblotting assay showed that 3,5-DCQA inhibited SFKs and Vav phosphorylation in fMLF-induced neutrophils, which suggests that 3,5-DCQA might attenuate O2.\u2212 generation, cell migration and TNF-\u03b1 and chemokine expression in stimulated neutrophils through the SFKs/Vav signaling pathway. Other signaling proteins such as ERK, p38 and Akt are also important in neutrophil activation36. However, 3,5-DCQA does not reduce the levels of phosphorylated ERK, p38, and Akt. Based on enzyme-based and cell-based data, we proposed that 3,5-DCQA modulates neutrophil function through intercellular and intracellular mechanisms simultaneously.",

SARs analysis of triterpenoid saponins (10-15) and aglycons indicated that their efficacy in fMLF-induced neutrophils was affected by sugar moiety and structural modifications at the E-ring. For example, triterpenoid saponins showed weak or no inhibitory effects on O2.\u2212 generation and NE release, indicating that saccharides in saponins are unfavorable for bioactivity in human neutrophils. Further, when the carboxylic acid at C-15 was cyclized with a hydroxyl group at C-20 to form a \u03b4-lactone ring (11-1 and 11-2), bioactivity vanished, suggesting that carboxylic acid is necessary for this activity. Conversely, the presence of a double bond at C-18/C-19 or C-19/C-20 (15-1 and 15-2) enhanced human neutrophil activity.",

L-selectin, \u03b22-integrin and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) are important adhesion proteins and are quickly expressed in activated neutrophils. These adhesion proteins promote neutrophil attachment to endothelial cells and firm their migration30. Chlorogenic acid (3) is another major chemical component in I. Kaushue12, and it was able to attenuate the adhesive ability of neutrophils by inhibiting L-selectin cleavage and reducing \u03b22 integrin levels, as well as suppressing the expression of PECAM-1 that is induced by LPS in neutrophils42. In the same study, chlorogenic acid also exhibited inhibitory effects on fMLF-induced neutrophil migration. In our experiments, both a BALF analysis and histological data showed that neutrophil infiltration in ALI mice was significantly reduced following treatment with IKWE or 3,5-DCQA. However, no difference was found between the IKWE (500 mg/kg) and 3,5-DCQA (25 mg/kg) groups. These findings suggest that the effects of chlorogenic acid on reducing neutrophil recruitment were not apparent in our in vivo experiments. Because the effects of 3,5-DCQA on neutrophil recruitment, adhesion and migration are unclear, further evaluation of the effects of 3,5-DCQA is necessary.",

O2.\u2212 generation was measured based on reduction of ferricytochrome c. In brief, after supplementation with 0.5 mg/ml ferricytochrome c and 1 mM Ca2+, neutrophils were equilibrated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 min and incubated with the specified drugs for 5 min. Neutrophils were activated using 30 nM fMLF or 100 nM LTB4 for 10 min after addition of cytochalasin B (CB, 1 \u03bcg/mL) for 3 min. Changes in absorbance concomitant with reduction of ferricytochrome c at 550 nm were continuously monitored. For elastase release, neutrophils (6 \u00d7 105 cells/mL) were mixed with methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA (100 \u03bcM) substrate at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min. After incubation with DMSO or test agents, neutrophils were activated as described previously, and changes in absorbance at 405 nm continuously monitored to assay elastase release. Inhibition of superoxide generation and elastase release were calculated in keeping with previous reports.",
