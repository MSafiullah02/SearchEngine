            "text": "Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide endemic disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that infects a broad spectrum of vertebrate hosts, including humans (Cook et al., 2000, Commodaro et al., 2009, Tenter et al., 2000). Both cats and dogs infected by T. gondii pose a potential threat to public health (Dubey et al., 2009; Hill, Dubey, 2002; Lindsay et al., 1997; Stagno et al., 1980). Thus, it is important to evaluate the role of domestic animals in T. gondii transmission. The development of sensitive and specific methods for the detection of T. gondii infection is a key step toward treating and managing patients with suspected toxoplasmosis. Serological techniques play a major role in the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in humans and animals. Several serologic methods have been standardized for the detection of T. gondii infection. Among these methods, the indirect hemagglutination test, the latex agglutination test, the indirect fluorescent antibody test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are the most common (Gy\u00f6rke et al., 2011, Li et al., 2000, Montoya, 2002, Remington et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2012). However, these procedures are time consuming, require expensive equipment and well-trained personnel, and can only be used in laboratories.",

The most widely used format for such assays uses gold nanoparticles for colorimetric detection (Meng et al., 2014, Nakayama et al., 2014). The antibodies bind tightly to the surfaces of the gold nanoparticles when correctly coupled, providing long-term stability in liquid and solid forms (Xie et al., 2014). Many studies have reported the successful detection of pathogens using this assay (Pengsuk et al., 2013, Sun et al., 2013). Some studies also have focused on detection of antibodies against T. gondii using this assay (Terkawi et al., 2013). Compared with other serologic tests, ICT is an economical, simple, and rapid approach, which makes it suitable for clinical and field applications (Peng et al., 2007). However, considerable efforts still need to be made to improve ICT in the areas of manufacturing processes, sample volume requirements and production costs.",

The assay is based on an indirect immunoassay format. Specific anti-Toxoplasma antibodies (IgG) in positive serum reacted with the gold-SPA conjugate to form a gold-SPA-antibody complex, which was captured by T. gondii-specific recombinant antigens on the NC membrane to form a gold-SPA-antibody-antigen complex that generated a red band on the test line (marked \u201cT\u201d). The density of the red band was proportional to the concentration of T. gondii antibody used. Excess gold-SPA conjugate reacted with nonspecific antibody (IgG) in the serum sample, flowed over the test line, and bound purified SPA on the control line (marked \u201cC\u201d), forming another red band at the control line of the strip. The results could be assessed with the naked eye within 5 min. After migration of the mixture through the membrane at RT, negative results were judged by the appearance of a single line in C.

The DFICT does not require washing or blocking buffers during sample addition, between the sample and visualization reagent addition steps, or at the termination of the reaction. Furthermore, in many conventional ICT assays, the liquid conjugated gold needs to be impregnated on glass fiber membranes to generate the conjugated pad and subsequently dried in a vacuum or dryer room. In DFICT, the use of the liquid gold conjugate reagent instead of dried conjugate makes the manufacturing process simple, as no drying facilities or low humidity control are required for device assembly. In addition, individual air-tight packing of the assembled device is not required. The reason for having a glass pad in the strip is merely to accommodate the applied liquid gold when the strip is placed in a lateral position (out of convenience).

The result is the rapid arrival of the sample at the reaction zone and maximum antibody availability to react with the capture antigen, thus achieving high sensitivity.

As shown in\nTable 2, among the 241 dog serum samples, 51 of the 57 positive samples determined by the DFICT were also positive via ELISA, while 182 of the 184 negative samples were confirmed as negative by ELISA. Compared with the standard ELISA, the sensitivity and specificity of the DFICT strip for the detection of dog serum samples were 96.2% and 96.8%, respectively. Among the 97 cat serum samples, 23 of the 28 positive cat serum samples determined by the DFICT strips were also determined to be positive via ELISA, while 67 of the 69 negative sera determined by the DFICT strips were confirmed as negative via ELISA. The sensitivity and specificity of the DFICT strip for detection of cat serum samples were 92% and 93.1%, respectively, compared with the standard ELISA. Kappa analysis (Sako et al., 2009) revealed a high degree of agreement between the DFICT and ELISA (\u03ba=0.906 for dog sera and \u03ba=0.819 for cat sera). Due to its good performance, this newly developed method could be used for clinical and field applications for the serological detection of T. gondii infection both in dogs and cats.",
