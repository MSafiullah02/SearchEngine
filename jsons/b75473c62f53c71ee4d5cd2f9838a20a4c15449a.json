Multi-omics studies with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are challenging as the requirements of biosafety level 3 containment limit the numbers of samples that can be safely managed. To address these issues, the multi-omics sample preparation technique MPLEx (metabolite, protein, and lipid extraction) was developed to partition a single sample into three distinct parts (metabolites, proteins, and lipids) for multi-omics analysis, while simultaneously inactivating MERS-CoV by solubilizing and disrupting the viral envelope and denaturing viral proteins. Here we describe the MPLEx protocol, highlight the step of inactivation, and describe the details of downstream processing, instrumental analysis of the three separate analytes, and their subsequent informatics pipelines.",

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Systems Biology for Infectious Disease Research Program was established to support research focusing on multi-omics approaches and dataset integration to develop and validate predictive models of infectious disease initiation, progression, and outcomes [2] .

Lipid metabolism and cellular lipids are greatly affected by virus infections by inducing major lipid modifications within host cells through the production of convoluted membranes and double membrane vesicles (DMVs) [19] [20] [21] [22] . Virus-induced production of membrane networks and organelles is a common occurrence among all positive sense RNA viruses [23, 24] .

Use of this specific labeling reagent requires a MS capable of achieving >30k mass resolution in order to baseline resolve all reporter ions. However, other isobaric labeling reagents are available that do not require this level of resolution for labs not possessing instrumentation with this capability. Isobaric labeling strategies provide several benefits including multiplexing of large cohorts to improve throughput; use of a reference channel for data normalization; and improved quantitation due to elimination of run-to-run variation and reduction in sample processing variability. However, the data also suffer from \"compression,\" where signals from co-eluting peptides can affect reporter ion accuracy. There are several ways to mitigate this compression effect and one of the primary means is off-line fractionation of samples to reduce sample complexity. Another method uses the additional specificity of MS 3 analysis (e.g., Thermo Scientific's SPS MS3 workflow) where interference is reduced through a second MS/MS of primary fragment ions from the first MS/MS scan. This MS 3 technique does not generally preclude the need for off-line fractionation. Interference can still occur, although it is generally minimized because the product ions selected for MS 3 are more likely to be unique to a single peptide. The disadvantage of using MS 3 (f) Events (min:event); 8:end trapping and start gradient, 28: start data acquisition, 108:end gradient and start column wash, 132:end column wash, 148:end data acquisition, 152:end column re-equilibration.",

Use Kasil-based frits for retention of packing material. (a) Install the analytical and trap columns in a configuration such that once the sample has been trapped and washed, it is eluted in the opposite direction onto the analytical column. (b) Prepare mobile phases (MP); MP A: 0.1% formic acid in water and MP B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile.(c) Set injection volume to 5 \u03bcL using a 5 \u03bcL sample loop and a 1.2\u00c2 overfill value, resulting in a total of 7 \u03bcL of sample being pulled from the autosampler vial for each injection.(d) Set the trapping flow rate at 5 \u03bcL/min and a total trap time of 8 min.(e) Set the analytical flow rate to 300 nL/min with the following gradient and wash profile (min:%B)",

Set up the source parameters as follows: MS inlet and source 350 C, spray voltage of 3.5 kV, sheath gas flow of 45, auxiliary gas flow of 30, and sweeping gas flow of 2. 7. Analyze each sample in both positive and negative ion mode with a precursor scan range of 200-2000 m/z and at a mass resolution of 60k. 8. Set up a data-dependent MS/MS method consisting of fragmentation of the top four ions, alternating between HCD and CID modes, and with the following dynamic exclusion parameters: repeat count 1, repeat duration 15 (s), exclusion list size of 250, exclusion duration of 8 (s), a low exclusion mass width of 0.55 and a high exclusion mass width of 1.5. 9. Acquire CID spectra using a minimum signal threshold of 500, isolation width of 2 m/z, normalized collision energy of 35, default charge state of 2 (see Note 17), activation Q value of 0.18 and activation time of 10.0 (ms). 10. Acquire HCD spectra at a resolution of 7500, a minimum signal threshold of 1000, isolation width of 2 m/z, normalized collision energy of 30, default charge state of 2, activation time of 0.100 (ms), and the first mass fixed at 90 m/z.",

Inspect the potential identifications one at a time, examining and evaluating the following:(a) Diagnostic ion and associated fragment ions (e.g., fatty acids). Verify that the expected peaks are present.(b) Isotopic profile: it should match predicted profile.(c) Extracted ion chromatogram: confirm the parent scan is at the peak apex.(d) Mass error: confirm it is consistent with the rest of the data.(e) Retention time: verify that it is within allowable tolerances for LC system. 6 . Select the correct identifications as going through step 5.7. Export selected results.8. Using LIQIUD's exported results from step 7, create a target list including observed m/z, retention time, and common name.9. Launch MZmine and import data files.10. Associate targeted files from step 8 to the raw data files imported in step 9.11. Perform mass detection on files not analyzed in LIQUID, and then build chromatograms from generated mass list.12. Perform peak alignment and then gap-filling on the aligned list.13. Check feature alignment and manually verify correct alignment for each lipid identification.14. Export final results including lipid name and peak area or peak apex intensity, which can be used for statistical analysis.",
