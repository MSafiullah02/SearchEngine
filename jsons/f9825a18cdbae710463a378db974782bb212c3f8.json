Antibiotic resistance varies according to geographic locales and is directly proportional to the use and misuse of antibiotics. Understanding the impact of drug resistance is of critical importance as the changing rate of antibiotic resistance in gram negative bacilli. Production of extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) is the most common mechanism of antimicrobial resistance in gram negative bacilli. ESBL are enzymes hydrolyse oxyimino beta lactamase like ceftazidime, cefriaxone, cephotaxime and monobactam but have no effect on cephamycins carbapener and related compound. Beta lactam antibiotics, including third-generation cephalosporins, are frequently used for the treatment of infections both in community and hospital setting in Iran. With reports on high prevalence of ESBL production in members of Enterobacteriaceae and paucity of information on different parts of Iran, we conducted this study to determine the prevelance of ESBL production among isolated uropathogenic E. coli as well as their antibiotic susceptibility to newer agents.",

Despite several reports on the occurrence of NCC in central, eastern and western Africa, its importance in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) needs yet to be established. In 2007, two explorative surveys were carried out in Kinshasa: one survey on porcine CC in markets and abattoirs located in different areas across the city, and one on human NCC among patients with epilepsy in a neurological centre in Kinshasa. The Objective was to determine the presence of (N)CC in Kinshasa and to assess the knowledge of the disease within specific target populations (people involved in pig rearing, marketing and slaughtering and patients with epilepsy, respectively). Methods used in both studies were serum circulating antigen detection for the diagnosis of active cysticercosis, and questionnaires on the knowledge of the disease. In addition, pigs were examined by lingual palpation. All patients were subjected to a detailed neurological examination according to the ILAE guidelines and those with active NCC were followed up using neuro-imaging techniques. Preliminary analyses indicate that although pig holders are familiar with the disease, active CC is highly prevalent in pigs sold in Kinshasa, with detectable circulating antigens ranging from 24.2 to 51.2% (n = 420) depending on the region of origin. Interestingly, none of the pigs were positive by lingual palpation, suggesting that a pre-selection for sale occurred including only the lingual negative animals. The percentage of active (N)CC among the patients with epilepsy was 6.7%. In 9.1% of this subpopulation the diagnosis of NCC was confirmed by neuro-imaging. More extensive and detailed community based studies have recently been set up to assess the importance of the taeniasis/cysticercosis complex in Kimpese (Bas-Congo), a rural area of DRC with known risk factors for the disease. Initial results obtained from 153 pigs kept in extensive, free-range conditions show a prevalence of CC of 5.2% by lingual examination and of 41.2% by circulating antigen detection. The community-based study in humans is currently ongoing. The data obtained in this initial phase, confirm the presence of (N)CC in DRC, with potentially important economic and public health consequences as seen in the surrounding countries. More in depth studies are warranted to further investigate its magnitude, course and determinants, with the final aim of controlling the disease in DRC.",

Most of them are virus-based, such as Aedes aegypti densovirus, recombinant vaccinia virus, and sindbis virus expression vector. One of major draw backs in virus-based expression vectors is that virus-based vector effects are hardly excluded. Although some plasmid-based expressing vectors have also been used in studying mosquito, they are not easy to be applied due to lower efficiency of transient transfection in mosquito cell lines. In this study, we have established a plasmid-based stable expression and knockdown system in mosquito cell lines. We incorporated Drosophila actin 5C promoter and baculovirus ie1 promoter into the plasmid to drive antibiotic resistant gene and target gene, respectively.",

However, use of DEC alone is still relevant especially in those countries like India where a vast population requires huge amounts of money to treat the population at risk for a considerable period. Efficacy and feasibility of annual single-dose of DEC was evaluated in an endemic Tea Estate worker population of Assam. A single annual dose of DEC (6 mg per kg body weight) was given to all the eligible population of the selected tea estate for six years. Prior to mass DEC administration, night blood survey for microfilaria prevalence and mosquito (Culex quinquefasciatus) dissection for vector infection rate were done from morning in-door resting collections. Subsequently these indices were monitored at annual and monthly intervals respectively before each cycle of drug administration. Decline in the microfilaria rate and infection/infectivity rate was evident even after the first round of treatment that goes down further significantly in the subsequent years. After six consecutive annual rounds of DEC mass treatment, microfilaria rate dropped down from 10.2% to 0.37% and vector infection rate from 3.1% to 0.03%. Host clearance was 90.2%. Compliance to DEC in take was good and side effects were mild and temporary in nature lasting within 12 hours after medication. DEC alone in such a population is useful in LF eradication.",

Microfilaremia and specific IgG4 were used to compare infection between two areas geographically different: the forest area of Woleu Ntem (WN), the Savannah area of Haut Ogoou\u00e9 (HO). The microfilaremia prevalence was not significantly different between the forest and the savannah area (21% vs. 25.1% respectively; X 2 = 1.842; DL = 1, P = 0.174), while this prevalence was high in men compared to women in both cases (X 2 = 18. 148; DL = 1, P = 0.00 for WN; and X 2 = 34.973, DL = 1, P = 0.00 for H O). However, the number of individuals with high microfilaremia (>5000 microfilaria/ ml) was significantly high in forest compared to savannah (28.5% vs. 13.11%; X 2 = 5.880, DL = 1; P = 0.015). Furthermore the prevalence of specific IgG4 in the forest area was significantly higher compared to the savannah (75% vs. 63.63%, X 2 = 6.732, DL = 1; P = 0.009). An important proportion of individuals in both areas without microfilaria in their blood produce a detectable level of specific IgG4 (75. 19% for WN and 80. 08% for HO). Both specific IgG4 and microfilaria prevalence have almost reach their maximum level by the age of 11-20 years in WN, while a trend toward age related evolution for microfilaremia and specific IgG4 was seen in HO. CONCLUSION Microfilaremia and specific IgG4 level provide a trend for filarial infection in each specific area and may be useful tools for monitoring efficacy of a control program in a loiasis endemic zone.",

OBJECTIVES Serious adverse events (SAEs) have been reported after ivermectin (IVM) treatment of subjects harbouring high Loa loa microfilarial loads. The threshold above which such SAEs may occur is 30 000 microfilariae (mf) per ml of blood. However, as most of the individuals receiving IVM are treated as part of mass distributions, the initial Loa microfilarial load of patients who develop a SAE is usually unknown. This study aimed at evaluating to which extent one can estimate the initial microfilaraemia from information collected after treatment.

Based on data from Caco-2 cells and the Ussing chamber, the main route of gastrointestinal transport was suggested to be paracellular, which has been observed for small, hydrophilic compounds similar to eflornithine.

Presently, standard diagnostic confirmation of HAT requires demonstration of parasites in blood, lymph nodes or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, diagnosis of this infection remains challenging due to low parasitaemia exhibited by most infected people. This is especially true in T. b. gambiense infections where the parasitaemia can vary between more than 10 000 trypanosomes/ml, which is easily detectable, and less than 100 trypanosomes/ml of blood, which is below the detection limit of the standard diagnostic Methods. As a result, 20-30% of HAT patients are left undiagnosed by the standard parasitological techniques. The Objective of this study was to develop a highly sensitive NASBA assay that can detect relatively low numbers of T. brucei parasites in blood, as obtaining CSF material as clinical sample is a painful procedure to the suspected patient. We have targeted the 18S ribosomal RNA gene sequence for higher sensitivity, because rRNA copies occur in high numbers (>10 000 copies) in the cytoplasm and also contains sequences conserved within trypanosomatids and genus-specific sequences.",

Interesting, there was severe impairment in the accumulation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the corpus callosum and septum in brain sections from MyD88 -/mice compared to the wild type, which correlated with reduced expression of IP-10 and IFN-c in the brain of such mice. Surprisingly, unlike wild type mice, MyD88 -/mice showed significantly more trypanosomes in these white matter areas and a highly reduced expression of iNOS, an enzyme necessary for the secretion of nitric oxide that is used by host to control trypanosomes.

Perrin Tufts University, Pathology, Boston, USA The Chagas' disease parasite Trypanosoma cruzi uses the host-cell cytosol to differentiate, replicate and spread infection, requiring long-term survival of infected cells. The T. cruzi crosstalk with the cell cytosol components is critical for parasite growth, dissemination and maintenance of infection in mammals, enabling T. cruzi to establish chronic infection despite strong immune response to the parasite. Yet the molecular basis underlying the interaction of the parasite with the intracellular milieu remains largely unexplored and little, if anything is known of how cells are protected against consequences of long-lasting intracellular parasitism. Our Objective was to study molecular mechanisms of intracellular T. cruzi interaction with host cell survival signaling (in the host cell cytosol). Since T. cruzi has a natural tropism for peripheral nervous system, where parasites readily invade Schwann cells, immortalized human Schwann cells were used as a host for T. cruzi (Silvio strain). A combination of bioinformatics, gene transfer technology, immunochemistry, fluorescence microscopy, in vitro kinetic assays, mRNA microarray and real-time PCR approaches were employed. We show that while in the cytosol of Schwann cells, T. cruzi inhibits cell death until full maturation of parasites into infective trypomastigote stage, by inducing PI3 kinase/Akt pathway. We also demonstrate that a T. cruzi protein, trans-sialidase/parasite-derived neurotrophic factor (PDNF) located on the T. cruzi surface is a substrate and activator of Akt kinase, a prototypic anti-apoptotic trigger. Akt activation is sustained and is most prominent late in the infection cycle, when parasite burden, as well as expression and phosphorylation of PDNF are maximal. In Schwann cells, genetically modified to express PDNF, it upregulates Akt transcription and phosphorylation-dependent activation while suppressing transcription of proapoptotic genes such as caspase-9, FOXO and BAX. Consequently, PDNF elicits a sustained functional response that protects host cells against apoptosis induced by oxidative stress and proapoptotic cytokines tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) and transforming growth factor-b (TGFb). Collectively, our results demonstrate that T. cruzi PDNF is a parasite factor which regulates PI3K/Akt signaling of the infected cells, thus controlling host cell survival. Given our earlier study showing that PDNF activates Akt by binding to neurotrophic surface receptor TrkA, these findings give rise to a novel concept of a parasite protein dually activating host survival signaling at the cell surface as a receptor-binding ligand and intracellularly as a scaffolding adapter.",

Increasing travel and immigration from endemic to nonendemic areas lead to emerging cases in North America and Europe. Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, presents a high degree of genetic variability.

Diagnosis is difficult and treatment options are few, as Pentamidine the only available drug in the country has serious site effects, and failing (due to emergence of drug resistance?). Alternative drugs, like miltefosine, are needed and show promising efficacy as will be presented. Furthermore, insight in epidemiology and biology of the disease is lacking in the country.

As the symptoms of leishmaniasis can vary and are frequently confused with other agents, specific diagnosis is crucial. High levels of inter and intra species variation have been observed in Old and New World Leishmania species in the rapidly evolving internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of the ribosomal operons. PCR Methods targeting the ITS1 and ITS2 regions were described for the direct diagnosis of different clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis and parasite identification. In the present study, we aimed to optimise ITS1 and ITS2 real time PCR assays using clinical specimens. Thirty clinical specimens of patients with human VL, CL and dogs with canine leishmaniasis from different regions of Turkey and reference controls were used. Real time online PCR was performed using 50 ng of genomic DNA, 400 nM each primers for ITS1 (primers: LITSR and L5.8S) that amplify a 200-bp product and ITS2 (primers: L5.8SR and LITSV) that amplify a 700-bp product, 1.6 ll of MgCl 2 (25 mM), 2 ll LightCycler FastStart Master SYBER Green 1, and 7.4 ll PCR grade water to a reaction total volume of 20 ll. PCR products were further sequenced for species identification.

In some studies having animals in or around the house was a risk factor, in others it was protective. We investigated the hypothesis that keeping domestic animals inside the house is a risk factor for VL. We also looked at other factors, primarily because of their potential as confounders. RESULTS We enrolled 141 cases and 282 controls. We found no statistically significant associations between VL and keeping domestic animals inside the house (OR of 0.88 for bovines and 1.00 for any animal) or ownership of domestic animals (OR of 0.97 for bovines and 1.02 for any animal). VL was significantly associated with housing conditions. Living in a thatched house (OR 2.60, P = 0.001) or a house with damp floors (OR 2.60, P = 0.011) were statistically significant risk factors, independently from socio economic status.",

Already noted in subjects with HIV infection, VL in patients who are immuno-compromised due to malignant disorders, organ transplant and immunosuppressive therapy is a more recent issue. In immuno-competent hosts, VL symptoms comprise fever, cachexia, anaemia, leucopoenia, liver and spleen enlargement, and hyper-gammaglobulinemia. In immuno-compromised patients clinical onset is often unusual with atypical localizations. Relapses, which are exceptional in immuno-competent patients, are frequent. We report two cases of multiple relapses of VL in two patients, both with multiple myeloma (MM). Case 1. A 43-year-old-male with MM underwent bone marrow transplant in 1996 and 1999. In 2005, during treatment with thalidomide, cyclophosphamide and steroids, the patient presented with fever and low platelet count. Bone marrow examination was positive for leishmania amastigotes while IFA was negative. Treatment with liposomial amphotericin B (L-AMB) brought rapid recovery. In 2007, during treatment with thalidomide and endo-xan, following fever the patient underwent further bone marrow aspiration which was positive for leishmania amastigotes. Clinical remission was observed after treatment with amhotericin B lipid complex (ABLC). Since 2008, the patient has been free of immunosuppressive treatment and has had no further VL relapses.",

In this work, development of electrochemical biosensors for leishmaniasis diagnosis was investigated. The example of canine leishmaniasis to L.infantum is taken and developed prototype could be validated in large scale for diagnosis, depending on used bio-recepteur, of all forms of leishmaniasis for humans and animal reservoirs. Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis is a severe disease affecting different mammalian species, including the human population. It is a dangerous emerging parasitic disease found in 88 countries with a total of 200 million people at risk. It is caused by Leishmania protozoa and transmitted by the bite of phlebotomes. Canines are considered as the main urban reservoir for Leishmania spp. In some regions in the world, canine leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania infantum, is highly prevalent. Per consequence there is an increasing need of new kinds of diagnostic tools for disease survey in dog's population. Biosensors, a combination of signal transducers and bio-components, are emerging as a crucial alternative for detection of pathogens. In this work, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy method (EIS) was used for canine leishmaniasis sero-diagnostic using Soluble Leishmania Antigens (SLA) and recombinant leishmania antigen (rK39) as biological targets. Biosensors are based on the immobilization of SLA or rK39 onto functionalized gold electrodes. Investigations were conducted by an electrochemical cell in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) containing a redox couple. The interaction of the immobilized leishmania antigens with leishmania specific antibody was measured by EIS method. It was found that both antigens (SLA and rK39) retained their recognition by leishmaniasis seropositives canine serums selected by IFIT (Immuno-Fluoresce Indirect Test) and ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay).The sensitivity was higher with rK39 and SLA, respectively.",

Most of the dogs and infected humans are asymptomatic and incubation period of the disease is long. VL is not a notifiable disease in some of the regions of Spain. All of these factors are generating an underreporting of real cases of VL in our region. Pediatricians and family medical doctors should be aware of the role of VL in differential diagnosis in a child with fever and pancytopenia in the Mediterranean endemic area. Active surveillance and genotyping of Leishmania species should be taken into account to improve the knowledge of real incidence of cases of VL. CONCLUSIONS Socio-economic status seems not to play a role on the L. donovani infection prevalence but domestic animals seem to be linked to an increased risk of exposure. The fact that women have a lower DAT prevalence after 14 years old may be explained by behavioral or demographic factors (i.e. marriage) and may have an impact on disease transmission in villages and in the region.",

However, an experimental study showed that EPO is expressed by non-hematopoietic tissues. Gene cloning has shown that EPO is a member of the cytokine superfamily type I, which is multifunctional. EPO is most closely related to cytokines that modulate growth and inflammation. In this study, in vitro antileishmanial effect of EPO was questioned. A clinically isolated Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) MON1 strain was used in experiments. Resting mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with EPO (10 U/mL), EPO/2 (5 U m/L), EPO/4 (2.5 U/mL), L-NAME (nitric oxide inhibitor), EPO/L-NAME, EPO/2/L-NAME in 1:1 multiplicity of infection (M.O.I) for 24 -48 -72 hours. Following incubations extracellular nitric oxide (NO) levels and apoptosis (Hoechst 33342) / necrosis (propidium iodide) were calculated. In simultaneous groups, cells were lysed with sterile distilled water and amastigote counts were done following Giemsa staining. Following 24 -48 -72 hours, amastigote counts were found to be significantly lower in EPO groups compared with EPO/2, EPO/4, L. infantum, L-NAME, EPO/L-NAME groups in M.O.I 1:1. Interestingly, NO responses were not affected in all experimental groups. Apoptosis / necrosis balance was nearly parallel to EPO groups. It is known that EPO is a multifactorial tissue protective cytokine. Therefore it is interesting to study its additional biological functions. L. infantum is known to inhibit NO response, and exhibits its pathogenicity by entering the cell. This study showed that EPO inhibited the entry of L. infantum into the macrophages, and had a possible protective effect on macrophages.",

Unfortunately, the incidence rate of drugresistant cutaneous Leishmaniasis unresponsive to meglumine antimoniate is increasing in Iranian patients. In order to define the protein expressional changes related to the process of drug resistance in anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL), we performed a comparative proteomics analysis on promastigotes of two genetically related Leishmania tropica clinical field isolates. Meglumine antimoniate sensitive and resistant L. tropica isolated from ACL patients in northeastern Iran. Whole cell proteins of cultured promastigotes were analyzed with 2-DE and differentially expressed proteins were further identified by MALDI-Tof-Tof mass spectrometry. Activated protein kinase c receptor (LACK), protein disulfide isomerase, and iron superoxide dismutase were those proteins with over-expression profile in drug resistant isolate. Alpha tubulin, prostaglandin f2-alpha synthase, and vesicular transport protein were down-expressed in drug resistant promastigotes. This proteomics analysis provided possible molecular mechanisms in drug resistance of Iranian L. tropica isolates. We discussed the cellular function of these proteins and their probable roles in drug resistance.

            "text": "CONCLUSIONS Increasing traveling all around the globe made possible the import of the tropical diseases in the temperate and cold weather regions. The diagnosis of tropical diseases takes longer and is more difficult, especially in the visceral leishmaniasis. It's very important to provide essential knowledge on early diagnosis and management of imported leishmaniasis cases in Romania acquired especially by traveling and working in the Mediterranean countries. Treatment of leishmaniases remains challenging due to drug limitation, toxicity and emergence of drug resistant strains. New drugs are needed as well as the development of alternative strategies, such as combination therapy, to improve the management of leishmaniases. Antiparasitic activity of nicotinamide (vitamin B3) was previously described in our laboratory, with a significant leishmaniostatic effect on intracellular forms at a concentration range from 5 to 20 mM. Nicotinamide is one of the main precursors for NAD synthesis and is provided by nutritional supply or by the breakdown of NAD when used as substrate by NAD-consuming enzymes. In silico screening of Leishmania genome showed a simplification of NAD salvage pathway and, more importantly, the absence of the de novo pathway. We therefore investigated NAD synthesis in Leishmania parasites by focusing on the nicotinamidase, the first enzyme of the salvage pathway that converts nicotinamide in nicotinic acid and that is absent in higher eukaryotes. Nicotinamidase manipulations have been previously shown to play a role in infectivity and development of Brucella abortus and Borrelia burgdorferi that are auxotroph for NAD synthesis. Surexpression and gene inactivation studies of nicotinamidase gene were performed on Leishmania infantum to evaluate its implication in parasite biology and virulence. In the same way, we have evaluated the potential use of this cheap vitamin as a direct adjuvant to improve efficacy, while reducing toxicity, of standard antileishmanial drugs (antimonial, pentamidine, amphotericin B). Interestingly, we showed that nicotinamide synergizes specifically in vitro with antimony to significantly enhance the antiproliferative effect against intracellular Leishmania infantum parasites. Altogether, these results highlight a new auxotrophic pathway in Leishmania that might represent an interesting target for developing new therapeutic strategies against these parasites.",

A vital prerequisite to the implementation of drug campaigns to reduce the morbidity associated with this group of parasites is a sound understanding of geographic distributions of infection. In resource poor settings this requires rapid, cost effective survey techniques to identify populations at risk, which currently do not exist for soil-transmitted helminths. An important part of developing rapid survey techniques is the consideration of levels of spatial heterogeneity (autocorrelation) of the parasites concerned. Semivariogram analysis revealed that hookworm displays spatial autocorrelation over large scales, and A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura display either spatial autocorrelation over small scales, or are randomly distributed. Using computer simulations of STH infection at public primary schools in Kenya, the effect of these varying levels of spatial autocorrelation on the performance of different sampling strategies will be investigated and results discussed.",

We diagnosed a HbH anomaly and heterozygosity for HbS and saw Mansonella perstans in the filtered blood as well as strongyloides larvae in the stool. Because of positive Schistosomiasis antibodies we did a rectal snip which led to massive bleeding but did not show any eggs but rectal ulcerations due to CMV histologically. Subsequently we treated with Ivermectine, Praziquantel and Foscavir and followed the patient up. One year later he was admitted for a FUO but the cause for it was not established and repeated anthelminthic therapy did not change his condition. He then developed leucocytosis and was diagnosed to suffer from myelodysplastic syndrome RAEB 2. Before a bone marrow transplant could be done the patient died due to this condition, still suffering from fever of unknown origin. The post-mortem examination showed the liver harbouring numerous adult Armillifer armillatus worms with typical screwhole like lesions. A number of abdominal ultrasound exams did never show any liver foci and also abdominal CT scan did never show any significant findings of the liver. Still it can be assumed that the parasite was causing the chronic fever. Interestingly there was no eosinophilia at any time. Pentastomiasis is a parasitic zoonosis caused by pentastomes, members of an unusual phylum -Pentastomida -with characteristics of both arthropods and annelids. Adult pentastomes parasitize the respiratory tracts of reptiles or carnivorous mammals. The infection is generally limited to the tropics and subtropics, but ocular involvement has been reported in the southern United States. The majority of human pentastomiasis is caused by two species. The first, Armillifer armillatus, infects humans as secondary hosts. Infection is usually asymptomatic but has characteristic postmortem and radiologic features. The second, Linguatula serrata, can infect humans as does Armillifer or can cause a self-limited nasopharyngitis -the halzoun or marrara syndrome. Symptoms depend on the organ system involved and result from the death of parasites or their migration. Patients may develop abdominal pain, chronic cough, or night sweats. In heavy infections with Armillifer spp., death may occur due to secondary septicemia, pneumonia, or severe enterocolitis. However, most human infections are asymptomatic and the disease may be an incidental finding during routine medical consultation or at autopsy. Neither routine serology nor PCR techniques do exist. (Some spectacular pictures of the autopsy finding are shown). CONCLUSIONS Our results show that T. trichiura is a very common parasite in this suburb of Beira town. A. lumbricoides is less common and hookworm is rare although significantly more common in the rice field workers. Comprehensively helminths infections are highly prevalent in the inhabitants of all ages in the studied neighbourhood constituting a relevant public health problem for this population and possibly in other suburban areas in Beira. All four the study groups have a prevalence of STH infections >75%, with a pick of 97% prevalence in schoolchildren, reflecting the age intensity profile of worm infections. Moderate/ heavy intensity of infection is highly frequent (74%) in rice workers and relevant ( 3 15%) in other groups. The high prevalence rates of helminths infections indicate to mass treat school-age children of this suburban population with praziquantel and benzimidazoles.",

Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease caused by protozoan, Toxoplasma gondii. The infection is usually asymptomatic in man. Toxoplasmosis in pregnant women may cause serious difficulties for their fetus. Infection is common in different parts of the world. The prevalence of the infection in Iran is varied between 2.9% and 82.6%. Seroepidemiology of Toxoplasma infection in young women in Jahrom during 2006 is the aim of this study. In a descriptive cross-sectional study, sera of 409 women who were going to get marry, were studied using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of anti-Toxoplasma IgM and IgG antibodies. Data were analyzed by SPSS ver. 16 software. Seroprevalence of anti-Toxoplasma IgM, IgG and total antibodies were 2.0%, 13.0% and 14.4%, respectively in this study. The most infected age groups were <20 for IgM and >36 for IgG antibodies. The prevalence of the antibodies was higher in urban dwellers and well-cooked meat compare to rural dwellers and unwell-cooked meat, respectively. No correlation between the infection and contacting with cats was seen. Low seroprevalence of anti-Toxoplasma antibodies in the young women in Jahrom, showed the importance of the health education of Toxoplasma risk factors during pregnancy. 4.14-111 METHODS Four DNA extraction Methods (boiling, lysis + centrifugation, miniMAG commercial system and phenol-chloroform) were compared with respect to the time of completion, the manual labor involved and the PCR analytical sensitivity for the detection of T. gondii in CSF.

Toxoplasmosis is generally asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals but may be dangerous for immunocompromised patients and pregnant women (congenital toxoplasmosis). People may be contaminated mainly by eating raw or undercooked meat as well as ingestion of oocysts present in contaminated environment. So far, there is no sufficient information concerning T. gondii oocysts prevalence in food. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate occurrence of T. gondii oocysts in meat, meat products, fruits and vegetables available in shops and local market places. A total number of 145 meat (pork, beef, mutton, chicken) and meat products (sausages, salami, meat spread etc) samples and 95 fruits and vegetables samples (strawberries, carrot, radish, lettuce) bought in shops and markets located in the area of Tri-city (northern Poland) were investigated. Meat samples were homogenized to release cysts of the parasite. The washings of fruits and vegetables were exposed to flotation method in order to recover T. gondii oocysts. Additionally, to break oocysts walls following Methods were used: mechanical destruction with zircon beads, thermal shock, protease digestion. Echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, is an infection of larval stage animal tapeworm. Echinococcus granulosus is the most frequent specie at Mediterranean basin. Imaging findings caused by E. granulosus are single, unilocular cyst or multiseptated cysts, showing wheel-like appearances. A complete microscopic image of the anatomic structure E. granulosus is very difficult to be obtained directly from the liquid of the cyst, but we could photograph it in the paediatric case presented below adding great interest to this presentation. It's described a case of a child 8-year old origin from Morocco and arriving a month before to Spain referring abdominal pain last 24 hours. Nor fever nil vomiting nil diarrhoea. He had lived in a rural area with dogs and sheep. Physical examination detected a mass in right-upper abdominal area. Chest X-ray evidenced right hemidiaphragmatic elevation and ultrasonography (US) demonstrated a unique hypoechoic cyst mass of 12.5 \u00b7 10.5 \u00b7 8.5 cm without septum or calcifications. Computerized tomography and Magnetic Resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of hepatic hydatid cyst. Not invasion into the bile ducts, portal vein or hepatic vein were observed. Dead cysts showing calcified cyst wall were not seen in our case. Parasitic examination for other parasites in stools resulted negative. IgE-specific serology for Echinococcus granulosus was positive (18.3 kUI/L). Serology for Entamoeba histolytica was negative. Hepatic enzymes were AST/ALT of 145/151 UI/L and LDH of 756 UI/L. Treatment with albendazol was initiated rapidly and surgical intervention was applied on the 18th day after admission. We obtained microscopy images of the complete welldefined structure of the E. granulosus, which are very rare to be observed directly from the liquid of the cyst. Albendazol was maintained for three months and discontinued when US and serology confirmed its trend to resolution. Posterior evolution was satisfactory and the patient remained asymptomatic.",

Nevertheless, for one human case we observed a coinfestation by two different strains (G1 and G6). This co infestation phenomenon was previously described in animal but never in human. The buffalo strain was isolated only in two cysts (one bovine and one human cyst). Therefore, the bovine / dog cycle may represent the way that this strain is maintained in Tunisia. Moreover, we observed some genetic differences inside the G1 strains. The human G1 isolates are intermediary between sheep and cattle origins, whereas cattle and sheep isolates are fairly different.

Moreover, the results of this analysis showed the existence of three strains of E. granulosus in Tunisia: the ovine strain (G1), the camel strain (G6) and the buffalo strain (G3). Enzyme electrophoresis has the major advantages that they can be used to examine a very large sample of genes, which have been shown to be variable within and between populations and they permit to determine the breeding system and the consequence of this system on genetic structure of the parasite. PCR-SSCP and PCR-RFLP are simple but powerful techniques with the potential to discriminate between the different strains of E. granulosus. Moreover, the conservation of the samples with these techniques is easier than IEF or starch gel electrophoresis. IEF and PCR-SSCP of the genetic structure of E. granulosus suggested that crossfertilisation occurs but is not predominant, therefore both self and cross fertilization occur in natural population.",

The analysis of isolates coming from the same liver sheep demonstrated the coexistence of three types of individuals which strongly suggests a multiple infestation of this animal by variable variants of this parasite. In addition, homoduplex and heteroduplex profiles were detected in almost isolates using DHPLC technic which attest of a genetic variation in the EMms2 locus. Furthermore, sequencing result exhibit a genetic divergence between the two species: Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis because of the emplacement of a short transposable sequence instead of the (CAC) repeated motif of the EMms2 locus. Regarding the multi-allelic EMmsB and U1snRNA loci, analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and DHPLC showed very complex patterns which are impossible to interpret.

Azizi 2 INTRODUCTION Toxocara cati (T. cati) and Toxocara canis (T. canis), roundworms of cats and dogs, are zoonotic parasites that cause visceral and ocular larval migrans in human beings. Humans and other paratenic hosts are infected by ingesting the infective Toxocara eggs from contaminated soil, unwashed hands, contaminated raw vegetables or ingestion of under-cooked organs, and muscle tissues of infected paratenic hosts such as chickens, cattle and sheep. It has been shown that the seroprevalence of toxocariasis in the rural and urban children of southern Iran is high and more than 50% of cats of this area are also infected with T. cati. It is stated that consumption of raw chicken meat resulted in visceral toxocariasis. It is possible that poultry reared outdoors and feeding in open range system, gain Toxocara eggs from soil and or by eating infected earthworms as paratenic host. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of albendazole and febendazole in experimentally infected chickens with eggs of T. cati by histopathological and digestive methods. Pathologic lesions were observed only in the untreated group and larvae were detected in brain of 3 chickens of this group by squash method. No larva was observed at histopathological level in liver, lungs, brain, cardiac and skeletal muscles and other examined organs of either treated or untreated animals. No lesion was seen in other tissues of the infected untreated chickens. Treatment resulted in disappearance of the larvae and disappearance of the gross and histopathologic abnormalities from their organs.

Intense itching, especially at night, was described as extremely distressing for patients and their families. Consequences of CLM were febrile superinfections, sleeplessness, family conflicts, school absenteeism and stigmatization. Treatment attempts ranged from the topical application of ineffective natural remedies (salt water, onion or lime slices) and antimycotic cream to toxic substances, such as tobacco and insecticides. BACKGROUND Brucellosis is a worldwide disease, which in Iran is at an endemic state. This disease is associated with chronic disabilities in humans. Combination therapy of brucellosis could lead to recovery, reduction of symptoms and decrease in relapse. However, drug resistance could develop. In Iran, Brucellosis is widely accompanied by tuberculosis. Therefore, a treatment that could encircle both diseases is necessary for regions where both tuberculosis and brucellosis are endemic. Considering the usage of Rifampin in treatment of tuberculosis and Rifampin-Doxycycline(R-D) as the standard regimen of World Health Organization (WHO) in treatment of brucellosis, this study investigates usage of Ciprofloxacin-Doxycycline(C-D) as an alternative treatment for brucellosis.",

However, it can become clinically manifest as a complicated cyst, sometimes as a result of superinfection by other microorganisms. This study aim is to describe the frequency, the clinical setting and the microbiology of superinfected E. granulosus cysts. RESULTS 503 patients were diagnosed with hydatidosis between 1996 and 2007. Of them, 39 (7.7%) presented a primary superinfection of hydatid cyst: hepatic in 25 cases (64.1%), thoracic in 11 cases (28.2%) and 3 (7.6%) in other localizations. In 8 patients (20%), other hydatid cysts were found besides the infected one. The mean age was 56.6 \u00b1 18.5 years; 61.5% were male. The most frequent symptoms and signs were fever (76.9%) and localized pain (66.7%). Four (10.3%) patients developed data of severe sepsis, and two of them (5.1%), died. In 3 cases, infection was documented after programmed surgery in an asymptomatic patient. Leukocytosis and eosinophilia were detected in 41% and 31% patients, respectively. All patients had been asymptomatic prior to the development of infection. Patients were treated with cyst drainage and antimicrobial therapy. Two elderly patients were successfully treated with antibiotic and antiparasitary treatment only. Definitive microbiological diagnosis was done in 14 hepatic cysts (50%) and 4 in other localizations. We detected a higher frequence of bacterial infection in complicated hepatic cysts (14, 50%). The most frequent causes of super-infected hepatic cyst were Escherichia coli (4 cases), followed for Streptococcus viridans (3 cases), Enterococcus sp. (3 cases) and Staphylococcus aureus (2 cases). Polimicrobian infection was detected in 2 (5%). Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from in 3 patients with a diagnosis of superinfected thoracic cyst.",

At admission the patient was treated prior to surgery with albendazole 800 mg dd. Due to persistent bacteri\u00ebmia and clinical deterioration, the patient underwent emergency surgery. The largest infected hydatid cyst, which rapidly had increased to a diameter of 19 cm, was drained, and a daughter cyst was resected from the omentum. A cyst in the left liver lobe was left in situ. Unfortunately some pus spilled into the abdominal cavity. Post-surgery 50 mg/kg of praziquantel dd was added to the albendazole treatment in order to be more effective in the prevention of development of new hydatid cysts in the abdominal cavity. In spite of adequate antibiotic treatment, fever persisted and blood cultures with mixed flora, i.e. Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus milleri and Veionella spp. were repeatedly found. Therefore the final hydatid cyst was evacuated by CT-controlled drainage. The pus was examined by gram-stain and hydatid hooklets, gram positive cocci and gram negative rods were observed. Later Pseudomomas auruginosa was cultured. Post-drainage the fever resolved and the clinical situation ameliorated. The patient is currently still in the intensive care unit. Praziquantel (PZQ), an anthelmintic pyrazinoisoquinolines, has been shown to be highly effective against cestode and trematode infections in humans and animals. In hydatid disease, PZQ dislocates the adult worms from their intestinal locations. PZQ further increases the permeability of the tegument of adult worms and protoscolices for proteolytic enzymes. PZQ has no effect on intact hydatid cysts, however in combination with albendazole (ABZ) it exhibits a faster protoscolocidal effect than either drug applied separately. Further, ABZ absorption has been shown to increase 8x when given in combination with PZQ. Different experimental dose regimens have been described for PZQ, however it is unclear what is the most effective regimen in hydatid disease. The ratio for adding PZQ to the chemotherapeutic treatment in this patient will be discussed, as will be the choice of dose regimen. OBJECTIVES TORCH infections represent a common cause of complications, including SAs in certain communities. The present study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies against TOXO, CMV and HSV infections, the possible relationship between the agents and SAs, and the indication and value of TORCH testing for fetal medicine reasons in this region.",

Prospective study of illness explanatory models may help to identify those more likely or less likely to accept the vaccine. These data complement findings in the ongoing post-vaccination study comparing those who were and were not vaccinated in the campaign. In addition to health system effectiveness to make interventions available, attention is needed to cultural concepts of cholera affecting vaccine acceptance. Findings are contributing to planning by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Zanzibar, and the approach for studying cultural features of vaccine acceptance is applicable elsewhere. Yaws (T. pallidum subsp. pertenue), Pinta (T. carateum) and endemic Syphilis (T. pallidum subsp. endemicum) are non-venereal treponematoses. It is now more or less forgotten that the first mass penicillin-based eradication campaign of the 1950s, treponematoses, had been highly endemic in many tropical countries especially among children. During this campaign more than 50 million patients were treated worldwide in 46 countries with penicillin since 1954. After this first coordinated programme against a special group of infectious diseases, non-venereal treponematoses were considered to be eradicated for more than a decade. Unfortunately, this initial success was not of long duration. The deterioration of formally established surveillance systems, accompanied by growing pauperization of the population in many overcrowded areas of the so-called ''Third World'', especially in South East Asia and West Africa, led to a renaissance of these infectious diseases. For instance, more than 6000 new cases of yaws have been detected in Indonesia only in 2006. According to the last estimation of WHO made in 1996, there are presently more than 2.5 million suffering from non-venereal treponematoses worldwide. As with syphilis the non-venereal treponematoses take a stage-dependent clinical course, while the stages considerably differ concerning the severity of their clinical appearances. Signs are variable and include depigmentated lesions in the late stages of pinta, exulcerated gummatous osteoperiostitis seen in the third stage in yaws, which lead not only to focal cortical rarefaction and periosteal changes affecting the long bones (''sabre tibia'') and to mutilating and disfiguring exostoses of the maxillary bones and the hard palate known as ''goundou''. All non-venereal treponematoses have in common, that their causative organisms can neither be differentiated morphologically nor serologically from each other. Thus they can not be distinguished from the causative agent of syphilis, Treponema pallidum. Only moleculargenetic methods detect some minimal phylogenetic differences between different T. pallidum subspecies, as shown in the last years, but this did not yet enable further differentiation of these subspecies diagnostically. As in Syphilis, the spirochaetes of the non-venereal treponematoses can be found in scrapings from serous fluid of the primary lesions by simple dark-field microscopy. Serologically stage-dependent antibody formation can be detected in all treponema specific and non-treponema specific screening and confirmation methods as in routine syphilis tests. Long-acting penicillin as Benzathine penicillin G is the drug of choise and given as a single intramuscular injection for all endemic treponematoses. Treatment in the early stages will result in complete cure of manifestations. This treatment scheme is also recommended by WHO for the entire population if the prevalence of clinical active infection in the whole community is over 10%.",

Consequently, non-plasmodia agents responsible for invasive infections and coinfections with malaria may remain unrecognized. The disease burden of Salmonella enterica including typhoid fever caused by the serovar Typhi is still largely unknown. RESULTS Contaminants were found in 9% and about 22% of the blood cultures were positive for pathogenic bacteria strains. S. enterica was isolated in more than half of the positive cultures resulting in incidences of 20/1000 and 1.1/1000 for non-typhoid salmonellosis and typhoid fever in children under 5, respectively. The total incidences for children up to 15 years of life were 8.8/ 1000 and 0.7/1000. Different risk factors for the infection with S. enterica were assessed.

Within 186 infants who had two or more UBT tests, 184 had at least one UBT positive result during the follow-up period. The positivity of the first UBT performed by 7 months of age was 76% and similar as in study in 1989 (71%). Recent cohorts did not show the decrease in the infection rate at 12-13 months of age which was seen in the prior study (77% vs 58%, P = 0.006). The UBT results of infants were not statistically associated with the mother's UBT results which was 84% positive (P = 0.38) or the hematocrit level of the mother. RESULTS Three cases acquired infection during leisure activity in Hamburg, one patient was canoeing in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. All four patients were male, median age was 52 (range 46-52). At an average of five days (range 4-6) before hospital admission, patients became symptomatic with sudden onset of fever and mild hypotension. Upon hospitalization, all patients presented with jaundice (mean total bilirubin 13.4 mg/dl; range 2.8-25.7), renal failure (mean creatinine 4.5 mg/dl; range 1.3-5.8) and significant hemorrhages fulfilling criteria for Weil's disease. Three patients presented with rhabdomyolysis defined as myalgias plus CK-elevation five times upper normal limit (mean CK 4.591U/l; range 2.210-7.426). All patients experienced olig-/ anuria with one patient requiring prolonged continuous venoveneous hemofiltration. Mechanical ventilation was necessary in three patients. One patient died of cerebral mass bleeding eight days after hospital admission. Two of the surviving three patients required long-term intensive care treatment of 28 and 33 days, respectively. Diagnosis was confirmed by complement binding reaction in three and PCR in one patient.",

Plague is often fatal without prompt treatment. In that case, human serology didn't reflect plague situation. After epizootic, only resistant rodents or those who have not infected were trapped and tested. Rodent serology didn't represent epizootic extent. Thus, it was felt desirable to search for a satisfactory marker. Dog obtain plague infection through infected flea-bites or consumption of infected rodent. Most are resistant and develop antibodies to Y. pestis which may persist for several months. Consequently, dog serology can be used as a marker for plague. The aim of this study is to evaluate in canine sera the developed dipstick for the detection of specific circulating plague antibody and then evaluate the serology of dog as a marker for the surveillance of this disease.",

Giardia infection is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and results from the ingestion of Giardia cysts through the consumption of fecally contaminated food or water or through person-to-person (or, to a lesser extent, animal-to-person) transmission. The cysts are infectious immediately upon being excreted in feces. The infectious dose is low; ingestion of 10 cysts has been reported to cause infection. Infected persons have been reported to shed <10 8 -10 9 cysts in their stool per day and to excrete cysts for months.

All utilized drugs are dose dependent inhibitors of recombinant C. parvum SAHH. D-eritadenine is a most potent inhibitor of recombinant SAHH in contrast to (S)-DHPA and Ara-A and exhibits inhibition activity at nanomolar concentration (D-eritadenine IC 50 = 30 lM). D-eritadenine and (S)-DHPA were also able to inhibit growth of C. parvum in the infected HCT-8 cells, but inhibition effect of D-eritadenine was lower than that of (S)-DHPA. This is probably caused by the polar nature of Deritadenine and its incomplete penetration into cells.",

The inhibition constant for (S)-DHPA was markedly lower than the inhibition constant for paromomycine, which is currently used drug against cryptosporidial infection. Therefore, this compound is a promising drug candidate for next step in drug development against cryptosporidiosis. ( Taurocyamine kinase (TK) plays a key role in maintaining energy homeostasis in cells. In the present study, we have determined the cDNA sequence of a contiguous two-domain TK from the lung fluke Paragonimus westermani. We then cloned the full-length (D1D2) and truncated domain 1 (D1) and domain 2 (D2) of P. westermani TK into pMAL and expressed the protein in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein has a mass of 80, 216 Da consisting of 713 amino acid residues. Both domains of P. westermani TK are active, however, D2 (K m = 0.51 mM) has higher affinity for taurocyamine than D1 (K m = 0.75 mM). The full-length and truncated constructs also showed higher catalytic efficiency compared to annelid TKs. Synergism during substrate binding was also exhibited by all of the constructs as implied by their K d /K m ratios (D1D2 = 3.42, D1 = 5.63, and D2 = 3.42). Sequence analysis showed that P. westermani TK shares higher sequence identity with molluscan arginine kinase (AK) and is quite unique from annelid TKs. Moreover, kinetic parameters obtained after site-directed mutagenesis was done on amino acids proposed to be involved in substrate specificity and binding suggest that P. westermani TK has a unique mechanism for binding substrate and stabilization of substrate-bound structure. Since taurocyamine kinase is not present in mammals, it could be a novel chemotherapeutic target and could also be utilized for the development of specific diagnostic tools for the detection of paragonimiasis.",

He was dizzy, felt weak, suffered from blurred vision, and eventually collapsed unconscious. He had taken no drugs, his temperature was normal, and there was no known pressure of carotid recetors. A doctor arrived on the scene and noticed paleness and intense perspiration, later diagnosing bradyarrythmia. Cardiopneumatic resuscitation was carried out and the young man was rushed to the nearest hospital. At the emergency unit he regained his conscience, the electrocardiogram was normal, the blood pressure was 120/ 80 mmHg and a rough neurological examination was completed, without findings. From his personal case-history it resulted that he had multiple syncope episodes that took place from the ages of 7 to 16, without existing an organic cardiopathy. Then, was as a probable releasing factor the infection of the upper respiratory system recognized, accompanied sometimes with pharyngalgia.

Janetzko DRG Instruments GmbH, Infectious Disease Laboratory, Marburg, Germany OBJECTIVE The common liver infection (Fasciola hepatica) is a worldwide distributed parasitic flatworm. It infects cattle and sheep, but also humans after consumption of metacercariaecontaminated fruit or herbs. The most widely used form of diagnosis of a Fascioliasis is the observation of Fasciola hepatica eggs in stool. However, eggs are only observed in later stages of infection and may easily be missed.

After washing away unbound material, horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-human IgG antibodies (conjugate) form a sandwich complex in the presence of anti-Fasiola Hepatica IgG during the second incubation step. After a second washing step immune complexes are detected colorimetrically by incubation with TMB substrate. The intensity of the developing color is directly proportional to the amount of Fasciola hepatica-specific IgG antibody in the patient specimen.

Ebrahimi 2 1 Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Environmental Health, Sanandaj, Iran; 2 Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran Biological indices such as coliform and the MPN test have been designed to assess the quality of water. In routine biological quality control procedures of water parasite quality control has been neglected due to a need for complex devices that is required for water filtration in huge volumes. In the present study, a simple device for water filtration without a vacuum pump designed, and added a certain amount of giardia cysts (3 samples containing 3000000, 30000 and 300 cysts in 50 liters of water) to a certain amount of water. The water was filtrated and the efficacy of the system was determined. In the second stage, water sampling was performed by means of the designed device. In this stage 12 samples from the public water system and 2 samples from water treatment plant were taken. A total of 400 liters of water was collected for testing. Results showed that the designed device was effective in removing giardia cysts up to 75%, 66% and 59% for 3000000, 30000 and 300 cysts respectively. According to the findings of this study all samples of water from different parts of city showed no parasitic contamination. Only the entering raw water of the refinery plant contained a number of larvae, 4 giardia cysts and 2 Entamoeba coli cysts. It is concluded the designed device showed to be effective in removing cysts and parasites from water, so it is suitable for use because it is a simple and cheap device. OBJECTIVES Accurate diagnosis of hookworm infections is crucial for patient management and monitoring of communitybased control programs.

Countries of origin were Bolivia (n = 485), Brazil (n = 249), Colombia (n = 61), Peru (n = 58) and others (n = 159). Chagas disease was diagnosed in 130 patients (12.8%), 127 of which were Bolivians. The sensitivity and specificity of the Chagas Stat-Pak TM were 95.2% (95%CI: 89.2-97.9) and 99.9% (95%CI: 99.3-100), respectively, resulting in excellent positive (99%; 95%CI: 94.6-99.8) and negative (99.4%; 95%CI: 98.5-99.7) predictive values. The comparison of the Chagas Stat-Pak TM on blood and serum showed an excellent concordance of results (99.7%), resulting in an near-perfect test's reproducibility (Kappa = 0.98; 95%CI: 96.4-100). CONCLUSION The Chagas Stat-Pak TM showed good sensitivity, and excellent specificity and reproducibility in a cohort of Latin American immigrants living in Switzerland. Nearly all cases of Chagas disease were diagnosed in patients originating from Bolivia, where the Chagas Stat-Pak TM showed very similar results in previous studies. The use of point-of-care tests such as the Chagas Stat-Pak TM improves patient access to both diagnosis and treatment. The validation of a second RDT with improved sensitivity, to be used in parallel with the Chagas Stat-Pak TM , is urgently needed. 4.10-056 Detection of Trypanosoma cruzi DNA in blood samples of Brazilian patients with megaesophagus and negative or inconclusive serology for Chagas disease *A.

The large-scale use of praziquantel might select for drug-resistant parasites, hence there is a need to develop new antischistosomal compounds.METHODS We studied the antischistosomal properties of mefloquine (MQ) in vitro and in S. mansoni-infected mice, including dose response relationships, stage specificity, hepatic shift, morphological effects and tegumental alterations utilizing scanning electron microscopy. The antischistosomal properties of the erythro and threo isomers of MQ were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The role of haemin in the mechanism of action of MQ was studied in vitro. For identifying binding proteins of MQ affinity chromatography studies and characterization by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry were conducted with schistosomula and adult S. mansoni.RESULTS MQ showed a fast onset of action on schistosomula and adult S. mansoni in vitro. A single dose of MQ (200 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally to mice infected with adult S. mansoni resulted in high or complete total and female worm burden reductions (72.3-100%). A hepatic shift of adult schistosomes was observed in mice already 24 h post-treatment and 120 h post-treatment >98% of all worms had shifted to the liver. High worm burden reductions were also observed for young developing stages harbored in the mouse. Scanning electron microscopic observations revealed extensive tegumental destruction as blebbing, shrinking and sloughing, particularly following in vitro incubation and on the female tegument. incubated with MQ in vitro died with and in absence of haemin or red blood cells. Addition of haemin resulted in faster and more pronounced death of schistosomes. The isomers of MQ are characterized by distinct antischistosomal activities. The highest activity on both development stages was observed with the erythro enantiomers of MQ. When schistosomula crude extracts were subjected to MQ affinity chromatography, a protein could be eluted with MQ and identified by MS/MS as enolase (9 unique peptides).CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCEOur findings hold promise for the development of a novel antischistosomal drug based on an aminoalcohol functionality. Further laboratory investigations have been launched to elucidate the possible mechanism of action most probably different between young and adult forms. 4.12-092 S. haematobium-infected Gabonese schoolchildren have elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine responses to single Tolllike-receptor ligands *L.

Department of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Leiden, Netherlands; 4 Board of Public Health Neuruppin, Bonn, Germany BACKGROUND Previous cross-sectional surveys showed Oesophagostomum bifurcum, hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis to be highly prevalent within a clearly demarcated area of north eastern Ghana. In some regions O. bifurcum-induced pathology could be detected in up to 50% of the inhabitants. Between 2001 and 2004 the area around the town of Garu was intensively studied. Repeated roundsofmassdrugadministration(MDA)withalbendazoleresulted in an impressive reduction in the prevalence of oesophagostomiasis and O. bifurcum-induced morbidity. The prevalence of the other nematodes was also significantly reduced, but still present. In 2003 north eastern Ghana has been included in the national lymphatic filariasis elimination programme and several rounds of MDA with albendazole and ivermectine have been implemented since. No data has been collected on the prevalence of O. bifurcum and related nematodes in the region after 2004. OBJECTIVE To study the transmission dynamics of intestinal nematodes five years after a period of intense surveying and repeated rounds of mass treatment with albendazole.METHODS Faecal examination, i.e. a copro-culture procedure as well as a multiplex real-time PCR for the specific detection of parasite DNA in faeces, was performed on approximately 1460 subjects in a population based survey. The multiplex real-time PCR is a highly sensitive and specific test for simultaneous detection and species differentiation of Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, O. bifurcum and S. stercoralis, with a semiquantitative output. A sub-sample of the study population (N = 483) was subjected to ultrasound examination in order to determine O. bifurcum-induced pathology.RESULTS O. bifurcum was not detected with copro-culture nor with specific real-time PCR in any of the faecal samples. Only 3 out of 483 ultrasound examined individuals showed very mild signs of O. bifurcum-induced pathology and no multinodular lesions were seen. Infections levels of hookworm (N. americanus) and S. stercoralis were greatly reduced compared to previous surveys, both in terms of prevalence and in intensity of infection.",

The aim of present investigation was to determine the prevalent influenza genotypes during 2005-2007 outbreak in Shiraz, the capital city of Fars province, Southern Iran, and compare the results obtained with those of previous study.METHODS Of 300 pharyngeal swabs collected from influenza patients, 26 samples were found to be positive by culture and hemagglutination (HA) assays. Typing and subtyping of the isolates carried out by using multiplex RT-PCR revealed 12 H1N1 and 14 H3N2. The phylogenetic and amino acid sequences analyses of our H1N1 Isolates showed 99-100% genetic resemblance to A/NewCaledonia/20/99(H1N1) vaccine strain.RESULTSMost of the Iranian H3N2 isolates varied form A/ California/7/2004 vaccine strain in 20 amino acids of which positions 189 226 and 227 were located in antigenic sites of HA1 molecule. These substitutions were not observed in any of the H3N2 subtypes from the same region reported previously.CONCLUSION In conclusion the H3N2 subtypes strains prevalent during 2005/7 influenza outbreak in southern Iran demonstrated a notable antigenic variation and differed from A/ California/7/2004 vaccine strain.",

Sadjjadi Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Department of Parrsitolo-gy&Mycology, Shiraz, IranVisceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused by Leishmania infantum, is an endemic zoonosis in Iran and dogs are considered the major reservoir for the VL in endemic areas. In recent years, feline leishmaniasis (FL) has been reported from several countries where leishmaniasis is present. The aim of this study was to survey feline leishmaniasis in cats and to detect its causative agents in VL endemic areas in Iran. Forty stray cats were captured from two VL endemic areas, Fars and East Azerbaijan provinces. Infection with leishmaniasis was evaluated through touch smear preparation of tissues, thin smear of blood samples, culturing and molecular Methods. Leishmania parasite was isolated from 4 out of 40 cats (10%). Molecular and isoenzyme characterization of the isolates revealed that the causative agent of FL is L. infantum. Most of the Leishmania positive animals were asymptomatic. Considering the high rate of feline leishmaniasis in this study, it can be suggested that cats may act as a reservoir host of VL in endemic areas in Iran. A cross-sectional sero-epidemiological study using Immunofluorescence Antibody Test (IFAT) and direct agglutination test (DAT was performed on serum of 40 cats collected from two VL endemic areas. Anti-Leishmania antibody was detected in serum of 10 out of 40 cats (25%) by IFAT (antibody titer \u202110) and in 8 cats (20%) by DAT (antibody titer \u20211: 20). Findings of this study confirmed that Leishmania infection is present in cats living in Leishmania infantum-endemic areas in Iran. Their role as domestic reservoir for Leishmania in the region needs further investigation.Yasuj  university of medical sciences, Parasitology, Yasuj, Iran; 2 School of Public Health and Institute of Public Health Research, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Department of Medical Parasitology and Mycology, Tehran, Iran; 3 Faculty of Medicine, Shaheed Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Cellular & Molecular Research Center, Tehran, Iran; 4 Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Tehran University, Department of Internal Medicine, Tehran, Iran; 5 School of Public Health and Institute of Public Health Research, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Department of Epidemiology and biostatistics, Tehran, IranClinically infected dogs have been identified as the main reservoir hosts of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum in Mediterranean region. The Objective of this study was to determine the potential of asymptomatic infected dogs compared with symptomatic ones as a source of L. infantum infection. For this purpose, Anti-Leishmania antibodies were detected with direct agglutination test (DAT) in 13 symptomatic and 53 asymptomatic ownership dogs. DNA of Leishmania sp. was extracted from skin and peripheral blood tissues of each dog and tested by PCR. Sixtysix Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were used for the determination of infectivity and pathogenicity of L. infantum isolated from the dogs. we used the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) rDNA sequence analysis. The results showed that 22 and 11 out of 66 inoculated golden hamsters were positive by PCR and parasitological examinations, respectively. From 22 PCR positive hamsters, 17 were related to asymptomatic dogs and 5 were from symptomatic ones. There was no significant difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs in producing Leishmania infection in the susceptible animal model ((P = 0.66).All the L. infantum isolates from symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs were similar. In Conclusion, asymptomatic infected dogs as well as symptomatic ones can harbor L. infantum in the blood and skin that are virulent and infectious for golden hamsters.Molecular survey of A2 proteins in leishmania species from endemic areas in Iran*M. Farahmand, H. Atashi Shirazi and H. Nahrevanian Pasteur institute of Iran, Parasitology, Tehran, IranLeishmaniasis is a disease of human beings and animals caused by the protozoan parasite of the genus Leishmania. Dogs usually develop the systemic (visceral) form of infection, with a highly variable clinical appearance. Canine leishmaiasis may be difficult to diagnose and frustrating to treat. In Iran, VL is endemic in some areas of northwest and south; the main causative agent is L. infantum and domestic dogs are the major reservoir for humans specially children. There are some stage specific antigens in Leishmania parasites, play a role in the pathology and protection mechanisms of leishmaniasis. The A2 genes within a multi-gene family encode amastigote-specific A2 proteins as virulent factors for the survival of leishmania parasite in the mammalian host.Immunoblot analysis of L. infantum isolates revealed for the first time that A2 proteins are detected in extracted amastigotes of L. infantum isolates from humans and dogs from endemic areas in Iran. In the present study we amplified by PCR and sequenced the A2 genes from genomic DNA of some old world CL species comparatively to L. infantum visceral parasites.Development of simple methods for the detection of miltefosine *T.

One hundred and ninety four CHC patients were randomly assigned to receive either silybin-phosphatidylcholine (group I), or silymarin (group II), or placebo (group III. Participants had baseline and 6 months follow-up for clinical, ultrasonographic, blood tests and QoL assessments using 33-items questionnaire based on (SF-36) adapted to Arabic.Results Sixty-one patients in group I, 63 in the group II, and 55 in group III completed the 24 weeks treatment trial. Pruritus was the only significantly less frequent symptom in the silybin phosphatidyl choline group compared to silymarin (P = 0.03) and placebo groups (P = 0.004) and there was no significant differences in frequency of any signs between the groups. There were also no statistically significant differences in liver function tests, Child Pugh grades, ultrasonographic findings or blood indices between the three groups. The percentage of patients with improvement in QOL at the end of treatment was, higher among the silybin phosphatidyl choline and silymarin groups versus the placebo group in the social domain (52.5%, 52.4% vs. 20% respectively), the psychological domain (73.8%, 71.4% vs. 50.9% respectively), the physical domain (63.9%, 79.4%, vs. 27.3% respectively), impairment domain (55.7%, 76.2%, vs. 47.3% respectively) and health perception domain (63.9%, 68.3%, vs. 45.5% respectively). While these differences were statistically significant (0.02-0.001), the magnitude of change was only apparent between the treatment groups versus the placebo group. At the end of treatment there was significant worsening of the Social domain (P = 0.01) and psychological domain (P < 0.05) in the placebo group. While there were no significant change in these domains among the Silibin phosphatedyl cholone and Silymarin groups. The physical domain and health perception domain improved among the Silibin phosphatedyl cholone group (-9.7%, P = 0.02 and -7.7%, P = 0.003 respectively) and silimaryn group (-18.7%, P < 0.001 and 11.1%, P < 0.001 respectively) but they got significantly worse (8.4%, P = 0.02) or did not significantly improve (-3.3%, P = 0.18,) in the placebo group.CONCLUSION Both Silibin phospatedylcholine and Silymarin seem to provide benefit to chronic HCV patients after six months of treatment compared to placebo. Both provide significant advantage in improvement of quality of life of chronic HCV patients compared to placebo. Improvement occurred in the psychological, physical, impairment domains and health perception and was more in the Silymarin group. While the social domain got worse in the three groups but the deterioration was significantly less in the Silibin Phospatedylcholine group. Further studies are needed using higher doses, prolonged administration and use in adjuvant with antiviral drugs. METHODS We tested 556 children who were followed since their age of 3 months in a randomized controlled trial for extended intermitted preventive antimalarial treatment with sulfadoxinepyrimethamine (IPTi) for markers of EBV infection at the age of 15 months. Possible socioeconomic risk factors for EBV infection were addressed using a standardised questionnaire. History of sickness, parasite load and hemoglobin (Hb) levels were assessed through a monthly follow-up with passive case detection. Characteristics of EBV positive and negative participants were compared using Fisher\u00a2s exact test and T -or non-parametric Wilcoxon test. Binary logistic regression was used to construct a predictive model for EBV infection.RESULTS 256 (45.8%) of the 556 children had detectable EBV-IgG antibodies at the age of 15 months. Prophylactic treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and a high financial status were associated with a protection from EBV infection (OR 0.7 [95% CI: 0.5-0.9]; OR 0.6 [95% CI: 0.4-0.9]). Having had at least one malaria episode, high parasitemia and lower mean Hb appeared as factors associated with a significant increased risk for EBV infection in the crude analysis (OR 1.6 [95% CI:1.1-2.2]; OR1.8 [95% CI: 1.3-2.8]; mean Hb 9.9 versus 10.1, P = 0.007). Having a malaria infection at the time of serological testing or one month before however was not significantly associated with a positive EBV-IgG antibody test results (OR1.4 [95% CI: 0.8-2.8]; OR = 0.9 [95% CI: 0.5-1.6]). Using a logistic regression model, the chance of EBV infection was found to be associated with the status of prophylactic treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, Guinea and the odd native Spanish subject but were absent among the strains from South America.",

Ivory University of Calgary, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Calgary, Canada Activation of the innate immune system by bacterial DNA and other invertebrate DNA represents a pathogen recognition mechanism. In this study we investigated macrophage responses to DNA from the intestinal protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica. E. histolytica genomic DNA (Eh DNA) was purified from log phase trophozoites and tested with mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. RAW cells treated with Eh DNA demonstrated an increase TNF-a mRNA and protein production. TNF-a production was blocked by pre-treatment with chloroquine or monensin. In fact, an NF-jB luciferase reporter assay in HEK cells transfected with human TLR9 demonstrated that Eh DNA signaled through TLR9 similar to CpG-ODN. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed NF-jB activation in RAW cells, as seen by nuclear translocation of the p65 sub-unit. Western blot analysis demonstrated MAPK activation by Eh DNA. Eh DNA effects were abolished in MYD88-/-mice derived macrophages. In the context of disease, immunization with Eh DNA alone or with the Gallectin protected animals from an E. histolytica challenge infection. Take together, these results demonstrate that Eh DNA is recognized by TLR9 to activate macrophages and may provide an innate defense mechanism, characterized by the induction of the inflammatory mediator TNF-a. OBJECTIVES Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis and/or complications of chronic and degenerative diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. In diabetes, hyperglycaemia increases generation of free radicals resulting in oxidative stress which further aggravates diabetic complications. This study investigated the effects of honey supplementation on hyperglycaemia, antioxidant enzymes, oxidative stress parameters and histology of kidneys in normal and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.METHODS Diabetes was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats (10-12 weeks) by STZ (60 mg/kg; ip). Rats were randomly divided into 4 groups of six animals each. The animals were treated orally for four weeks as follows: normal rats given 0.5 ml of distilled water (group 1), normal rats received 1.0 g/kg of honey (group 2), diabetic rats given 0.5 ml of distilled water (group 3), diabetic rats treated with 1.0 g/kg of honey (group 4). Data were analyzed by Kruskal Wallis H test followed by Mann Whitney U test.RESULTS Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and renal malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly increased in diabetic control rats. Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were significantly up-regulated in diabetic control kidneys. Body weight (BW), catalase (CAT) activity, total antioxidant status (TAS), total glutathione (TGSH), reduced glutathione (GSH) and reduced glutathione (GSH): oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio were significantly reduced in diabetic control kidneys. Honey significantly increased BW, CAT activity, TAS, TGSH, GSH and GSH: GSSG in diabetic kidneys. Honey significantly reduced FPG, MDA levels, activities of SOD and GPx in diabetic rats. Histopathological examination showed that honey-treated diabetic kidneys had reduced mesangial matrix expansion and thickening of glomerular basement membrane. No significant effects of honey on blood glucose and renal oxidative stress parameters in normal rats were observed.CONCLUSION These results indicate that honey reduces hyperglycaemia, ameliorates oxidative stress and protects against STZinduced diabetic renal damage. These findings suggest that therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing blood glucose and preventing oxidative stress may be beneficial in the management of diabetic nephropathy. The mechanisms by which honey exerts its antihyperglycaemic effect and protects against STZ-induced diabetic renal damage remain unclear and require further studies.",

The values of sensitivity and specificity could be even better than those we found, as the test used as a gold standard, though highly reliable, is not 100% sensitive and specific. Used as a screening test in a non-specialized laboratory, and in settings with a disease prevalence of about 20% as that found in our patient population, the RDT appears sufficient to exclude the infection when negative. However, the sub optimal test sensitivity would not be adequate for higher levels of pre-test probability. Positive results should always be confirmed with a reference test.",

The survey reached the expected target: 64 families get water from private pipeline-connected tap, but only 4 of these receive a constant supply; 236 families collect water from unprotected public taps and wells.CONCLUSION The persistent faecal contamination and poor water supply expose the local community to the risk of waterrelated diseases such as cholera outbreaks. Based on the outcome of this study, a project focused on PWS rehabilitation and continuous monitoring of water quality for prompt intervention is currently ongoing on Pemba Island.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS In this study performed at three hospitals in Madrid, 255 faeces samples were tested using the two immunochromatography strips CRYPTO-GIARDIA (CerTest Biotec, Zaragoza) and Stick Crypto-Giardia (Operon, Zaragoza). The samples were taken from patients with diarrhoea, HIV or from children under the age of 5 years. We also included faeces samples in which oocysts of Giardia duodenalis and/or Cryptosporidium sp. had been observed by microscopy. All samples were subjected to a microscopy study following their concentration and staining using the Ziehl-Neelsen method modified for Cryptosporidium sp. When there was disagreement between tests and in samples scoring positive, real-time PCR was used to confirm the result. OBJECTIVES The aim of this work was to analyze the microbiological quality including parasites (cyst and eggs of helminthes) and faecal coliforms.",

            "text": "On the three methods were identified Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica and only in two samples using Willis's and Faust modified we detected eggs of Enterobious vermicularis. Using Willis's method G. lamblia was detected in 42% of the samples; in Faust method 21% and Faust modified 14%. E.histolytica was detected in 7% in Willis method; 4% in Faust and 4% in Faust modified. We found 55% of correlation between Willis's and Faust method, 14% between Willis and Faust modified and 40% between Faust and Faust modified. 12 (~92%) of 13 samples were contaminated with faecal coliforms according the Official Mexican Norm NOM-112-SSA1-1994.CONCLUSION The special tortilla sold on streets shows high percent of contamination with Giardia lamblia, cysts (21-42%). Although this parasite can produce diarrhoea not all the people acquire the disease perhaps existing some immunological response but not for foreign people. Faust still is one of the most used methods in clinical laboratories on developing countries but the main problem to detect the parasites is the skill of the analyst and is needed to verify each observation with confirmatory tests. Unfortunately almost all samples analyzed for faecal coliforms did not pass the official norm (~92%). INTRODUCTION The area west of Almer\u00eda is characterized by a diverse population: 30% are immigrants, as well as a high percentage of illegal immigrants for which there is, obviously, no known figure. In the two main towns in the area, El Ejido and Roquetas de Mar, there are 104 and 114 diferent nationalities registered respectively in the Municipal census. The main motivation of this migration flow is economic, with agricultural work to be found in the greenhouses. There are some very poor sanitary situations. Notably, female migration has increased, and consequently there has been a increase in pediatric immigration and the number of births from immigrant women since 1996. It has therefore become necessary to implement a specific protocol of immigrant health in this area.",
