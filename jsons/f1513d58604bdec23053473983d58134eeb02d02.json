Previously, this model successfully forecasted the 60 incidence of COVID-19 in several provinces in China 5 . 61 62 Pregnant women experience unique alterations in the immune system and are often more 63 susceptible to severe respiratory infections 6 . Furthermore, the unique risks of pregnancy and 64 delivery prompt most women to deliver in the hospital setting, hence increasing exposure to 65 other hospitalized patients and healthcare workers. There are only limited data on COVID-19 66 and pregnancy, though available data do not appear to suggest increased severity of disease 67 among pregnant women 7-9 . Aside from their physiological differences, inpatient management of 68 pregnant women with respiratory diseases can be logistically challenging given the need for fetal 69 monitoring which often is not available in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting.

Though we do not have state level data, the peak incidence is 235 expected to vary by state in relation to severity and mitigation provided by each state 22 . With the 236 numbers provided in this study, we hope that we could provide and prioritize obstetrical care 237 providers with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). This is especially important 238 because nearly all women with COVID-19 will elect to deliver in the hospital setting, regardless 239 of the severity of disease. Thus, obstetric care providers will be facing a unique and unavoidable 240 exposure to COVID-19. Additionally, previous reports have suggested increase risks for preterm 241 birth, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery and perinatal death 24,27 . This might suggest that we will 242 also see an increase in resources utilization not directly related to COVID-19 or delivery alone. 243 244 Historical data shows that 2-4 peripartum critical care admissions occur for every 1000 245 deliveries, but during the peak of COVID-19 we estimated that an additional of 2 ICU 246 admissions per 1000 deliveries had happened. Although the peak has passed, the number of 247 critical cases will continue to linger and potentially continue to increase the strain in the medical 248 resources. Given the unique changes in physiology and the potential logistical hurdles, critical 249 care of pregnant women with COVID-19 could be challenging. Thus, obstetric care providers 250 should prepare themselves to provide insight into the multidisciplinary care of critically-ill 251 pregnant women 28 .

Practically, the model would assume increasing 201 interventions in the first half of the curve and gradual relaxing in the second half of the curve. 202Nonetheless, abrupt changes in future interventions will not be able to be accounted using this 203 model.204 205 Most of the cases in the US are symptomatic and we do not yet have the epidemiological data to 206 forecast specifically for asymptomatic carriers 17 . While asymptomatic cases may fuel the 207 transmission of COVID-19, reported, severe and critical cases are likely to put stress on 208 healthcare resources. Because of these reasons, we opted to not estimate the number of 209 asymptomatic cases. 210 211 We only forecast the incidence of COVID-19 during delivery hospitalization given difficulty in 212 estimating the number of pregnant women across gestational ages, we anticipate the number of 213 pregnant women to be larger than our current estimate. Forecasting the incidence of COVID-19 214 severe and critical cases are especially challenging given the lack of standardization in testing 215 algorithms and definition of severe and critical cases. Further, the definition of critical and severe 216 could be different in the setting of delivery hospitalizations given varying monitoring capability 217 of each labor and delivery unit. Though we were able to use all available data of COVID-19 in 218 pregnancy, including the largest case series to date, the lack of a large number of prior studies on 219 COVID-19 in pregnancy makes it difficult to obtain an accurate range in delivering 220 women 7,9,19,24 . 221 222 Monte-Carlo analyses have an inherent limitation that they can only perform according to the 223 accuracy of underlying assumptions. Similar to the phenomenological model, abrupt changes in 224 testing pattern or interventions could affect the performance of this model. Some labor and 225 delivery units are performing universal testing for all women admitted, it is unclear how many 226 units implement this practice as such we were not able to incorporate this in the model 25 . 227 Universal testing is expected to increase the total number of confirmed cases by adding 228 asymptomatic women. Lastly, there are reports suggesting the possibility of resurgence of 229 COVID-19 26 . As of now, it's not possible for us to model this since we don't the epidemiological 230 data for the resurgence. 231 232",
