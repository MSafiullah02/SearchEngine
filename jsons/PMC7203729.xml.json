To improve accuracy of protein annotation, bioinformatics tools use iterative searches of databases of individual sequences [e.g. PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) versus GenBank (Sayers et al., 2019)], search profile databases [e.g. HMMER (Finn et al., 2011) or HHsearch (Remmert et al., 2012; S\u00f6ding, 2005) versus Pfam (El-Gebali et al., 2019) or HHblits (Remmert et al., 2012) versus Uniclust30 (Mirdita et al., 2017)], and may involve comparison of query and target secondary structure [e.g. HHsearch versus SCOP (Fox et al., 2014)]. Annotation pipelines favor selectivity over sensitivity by imposing stringent cutoffs on similarity between query and database entries. Scores of similarity are interpreted in statistical frameworks using either expectation values (default cutoff E = 0.001, BLAST, HMMER, HHsearch) or homology Probability (default cutoff P = 95%, HHsearch).",

Its hit statistical significance increases with score of similarity between query and target, and it depends on sizes and diversities of query and target (Remmert, 2011). Specifically, large size increases likelihood of a hit score emerging by chance, while the opposite is true for small size. Notwithstanding HHsearch training on protein domains, it has been routinely used in analysis of proteins of unknown domain organization. For a single-domain protein, statistical significance of hit similarity must be applicable to its domain, since sizes of both are similar. On the other hand, for multidomain queries, statistical support of a hit associated with individual domain may be underestimated due to inflated search space that encompasses other domains of the query protein (Altschul et al., 1997; S\u00f6ding, 2005).",

However, for identification of distant relationships, accurate estimation of statistical significance could be impactful. The above problem may be particularly acute for RNA viruses (Baltimore, 1971), which typically encode large multidomain proteins (>1000 aa) (Das and Arnold, 2015). (Hereafter and for sake of simplicity, we will use polyprotein to refer to virus multidomain proteins). They are much larger than most proteins of cellular organisms, whose length distributions resemble lognormal, with a mean below 500 aa (Zhang, 2000). Human immunodeficiency virus, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and poliovirus, and very many other eukaryotic viruses encode polyproteins (Dougherty and Semler, 1993; Gorbalenya and Snijder, 1996). These polyproteins mediate replication/transcription and promote virus particle formation in either the synthesized form or after being proteolytically processed. Furthermore, the already known proteomes of RNA viruses are exceptionally diverse due to high mutation rate of RNA viruses (Sanjuan et al., 2010), with many relationships in twilight and midnight zones of homology (Habermann, 2016; Kuchibhatla et al., 2014).",

It was further grouped into 884 clusters using MMseqs2 (Steinegger and S\u00f6ding, 2017), following the authors recommendations for multidomain proteins and defining sequence identity rate (\u2013cluster-mode 1 \u2013min-seq-id 0.3 \u2013alignment-mode 3) and local alignment coverage (\u2013cov-mode 0 -c 0.8) (see Supplementary Text S1.2 and Table S1). Most of these proteins are encoded in a single ORF (Firth and Brierley, 2012). We parsed RefSeq entries corresponding to the analyzed proteins to extract region annotations from \u2018Region\u2019 features (O\u2019Leary et al., 2016). Other annotation features, such as \u2018CDS\u2019, \u2018Protein\u2019 and \u2018Site\u2019, which were not taken into analysis, may overlap with the \u2018Region\u2019 or include extra information.

Query profiles were built and compared to a database by programs HHmake and HHsearch from HH-suite 2.0.16, respectively (S\u00f6ding, 2005; http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/data/hhsuite/releases/all/). In all analyses, parameters of HH-suite programs were left at default values, with the exception of HHmake parameter \u2018-M first\u2019, indicating that columns with residue in the first sequence of the FASTA file are considered match states, and HHsearch three parameters: \u2018-p 0\u2019, allowing hits with Probability as low as zero; \u2018-norealign\u2019, blocking realignment of reported hits using maximum accuracy algorithm; \u2018-alt 10\u2019, enabling reporting up to 10 significant alternative alignments between a query and a target profile (S\u00f6ding, 2005) (Supplementary Text S1.3). To identify statistically significant hits and homologous regions, HHsearch hits were subjected to post-processing under three cutoffs: Probability >95%, E-value <10 and hit length of >50 aa of the query sequence. Hits satisfying these thresholds and overlapping on query were combined into a cluster, extreme N- and C-terminal residues of which defined boundaries of region in the query that was homologous to target(s). Statistics of the top-scoring hit in the cluster defined the entire cluster, and name of the top-scoring target profile in the cluster annotated the query region. Unless stated otherwise, all reported analyses used the hits post-processing. Also, we used HHblits v.3 (Remmert et al., 2012) for analysis of selected polyproteins as detailed in Supplementary Text S1.4.

Because of this uncertainty, we reasoned that the gain of statistical significance by LAMPA compared to HHsearch might provide only a lower estimate for the actual difference between Probabilities and E-values of the respective hits obtained for the polyprotein and expected for its domains. To improve understanding about how close the obtained LAMPA Probabilities and E-values for protein regions may be to those of the actual domains, we adopted an operational definition of polyprotein domain in relation to homology hit and used it to approximate borders of the actual domains; in total 507 hits on 431 polyproteins (see above) were considered for this purpose. Operational domain was demarcated as LAMPA hit that was extended by 100 aa to the N- and C-terminus; if distance to the polyprotein terminus was <100 aa, extension was adjusted accordingly (which was used in 48 of 507 cases). The demarcated domain sizes ranged from 164 to 732 aa (mean = 315 aa) that was close to dominant domain size in public databases and narrower compared to the range of 88\u20132172 aa (mean = 479 aa) of region queries that produced the original LAMPA hits (Fig. 1). For each of 507 hits, we then compared Probability and E-value values, assigned by LAMPA, to those obtained by HHsearch for a matching hit in a separate analysis that used demarcated domains as queries and involved no hits post-processing (see Section 2.2; Supplementary Table S2).",

In the designed length range from 100 aa to 10 000 aa, which encompasses most queries and targets of this study, P-value increased by approximately four orders of magnitude for queries of three pairs. This increase was limited to two orders of magnitude for the three selected queries illustrating LAMPA gain versus HHsearch. In contrast, dependence of Probability on length of designed queries and targets followed inverted logistic curve and differed between target and query as well as between the three pairs (Fig. 7D\u2013F). Dependence of Probability on designed query size was most noticeable only below the 95% threshold, where it followed growth phase of logistic. The selected LAMPA and HHsearch queries were at different places of this growth phase in two query-target pairs (Fig. 7D and E) and outside the growth phase in third pair (Fig. 7F) which explained different Probability gains of LAMPA hit in these pairs. Hit score and target diversity contributed to variable Probability gain in three pairs (Supplementary Text S1.5).",

Increase in the number of annotated regions per protein by LAMPA but not HHsearch was statistically significant (PW = 3.11e\u221208 and 0.752, respectively). LAMPA and HHsearch annotations covered larger share of polyprotein (mean region length was 312 aa, 321 aa and 265 aa for LAMPA, HHsearch and RefSeq annotation, respectively). This coverage increase was observed for 78.7% and 77.5% proteins, respectively, (Fig. 8B andSupplementary Fig. S6B) and was statistically significant (PW = 1.07e\u2212291 and 3.81e\u2212273).

Statistical apparatus of HHsearch, used in LAMPA, was trained on a dataset of structurally defined domains with the median size of 142 aa to ascertain high sensitivity and selectivity, although HHsearch is used for annotation of proteins, regardless of their domain composition and size. This expand ed application of HHsearch is due to two factors: (i) in contrast to sequence diversity of query (profile) (see HHblits), domain composition of query received relatively little attention in relation to HHsearch sensitivity; (ii) considerable complexity and uncertainty of domain delineation in protein sequences. We have addressed both aspects in this study and offer a practical solution to the detection of distant homology in multidomain proteins using conventional profile-based tools in the LAMPA pipeline, which could be particularly useful in the on-going exploration of the Virosphere (Saberi et al., 2018; Suttle, 2007; Zhang et al., 2019).",

The produced plots revealed constrained statistic-specific shape of considerable variation for the two statistics characterizing a hit score in relation to query size (Fig. 7). Due to training of the auto-calibration procedure on the domain dataset, this variation informs about hit score statistics in application to single-domain proteins. When applied to multidomain proteins, like those used in this study, it illustrates how statistical significance of hit scores may be underappreciated depending on difference of sizes of the intact protein and its domains. This underappreciation is realized regardless of multidomain protein size, although it may be consistently considerable only for large proteins.",

In that study, HHsearch was used to scan several databases, and this provision is also available in the LAMPA 1.0.0 package. Also, iterative profile programs, e.g. PSI-BLAST or HHblits, could be incorporated in the LAMPA to enrich query and improve homology recognition by targeting proteins that are not part of curated profile databases. These improvements could increase relative share of the QP-stage in homology detection and region annotation. In theory, the LAMPA may identify all domains at the #1 and QP-stage, with the AP-stage generating no hits, either due to the lack of queries or homology.
