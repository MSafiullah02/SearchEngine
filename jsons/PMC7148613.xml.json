Rivera et al.13 confirmed the adjuvant activity of Rb1 and determined that it induced a balanced Th1 and Th2 immune response in BALB/c mice. Earlier studies showed that a ginseng extract administered with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant improved antibody response with viral and bacterial antigens, favoring the production of IgG1 antibodies, whereas the addition of ginseng induced IgG2 antibodies. This suggests that ginseng could be used to improve the potency of aluminum hydroxide\u2013adjuvanted vaccines, particularly where an IgG2 response is desirable.14\n",

However, it induces recruitment of mononuclear cells within 24 h of immunization. Heal et al.17 administered tomatine alongside Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite (CS) peptide to BALB/c mice. They found that splenocytes from the vaccinated mice significantly upregulated interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 compared with controls.

Cytokine induction leads to activation of a variety of innate and adaptive immune cells.50 The immunomodulatory Th1 or Th2 effect of \u03b1-GalCer molecules can be varied by chemical modification of their sugar and fatty acyl chains, as well as by shortening the lipid chain length.51 Vaccine formulations containing natural GalCer or synthetic derivatives with different antigens have been found to be protective against viral infections and tumors in animal models.52, 53 Tengvall et al.54 demonstrated that intranasal immunization of a herpes virus type 2 glycoprotein (gD) with \u03b1-GalCer conferred complete protection against lethal vaginal herpes simplex virus-2 challenge in mice.

A wide range of polymers are available in terms of molecular weight, degrees of deacetylation, and other chemical modifications that make them a flexible material for variations in application (used by themselves or in, for example, delivery systems). As an adjuvant, chitosan has a broad number of properties including low manufacturing cost, biocompatibility, low levels of intolerance, and appropriate antibody response (mainly Th1).56 In addition, it has excellent mucoadhesive properties that make it suitable for vaccines administered via the mucosal route, and it is able to open up tight junctions to enable transport of an antigen to immune effector sites.57\n",

To date, the effects have been attributed to enhancing leukocyte, phagocyte, and lymphocyte activity, as well as increasing the immunization period of the vaccine and induction of early immunity.74 In addition, many of the compounds that show immunostimulatory activity are not water soluble, and so have been used with lipid vesicles such as liposomes to increase their bioavailability.70 Flavonoid-rich liposomes enhanced antigen-specific IgG antibodies and induced IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4, compared with propolis alone. In vivo studies by Orsatti et al.,67 revealed that propolis activated the initial steps of the immune response by upregulating Toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4) and production of proinflammatory IL cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6) in mice, thereby modulating the mechanisms of innate immunity.\n",

The results showed significant increase in antibody levels, as well as an increase in cellular immune responses, evidenced by an increase in the expression of IFN-\u03b3 messenger RNA (mRNA). It was also observed that the propolis extract raised the percentage of animals protected against a lethal dose of SuHV-1.65 Similarly, an ethanolic extract of green propolis administrated with oil in a bovine herpes virus type 5 (BoHV-5) vaccine resulted in a significant increase in antibody production when compared with animals receiving the vaccine alone.64 This adjuvant effect was attributed to the high amount of artepillin C and cinnamic acid derivatives as well as some flavonoids.64, 65 Furthermore, Ma and colleagues77 compared the effect of propolis with traditional vaccine adjuvants (oil emulsion and aluminum salt) in a porcine parvovirus vaccine.

This also allows pharmaceutical companies to modify and patent the NCE. However, although this may be possible for small molecules, it is not always possible for complex entities, such as polysaccharides. These challenges can result in decades of research from the time of initial compound elucidation to commercial development.92 For example, it took around 30 years from first discovering the activity of Taxus brevifolia extracts to developing paclitaxel formulations to clinical trials. Purification of the active substance can take varying amounts of time depending on the presence of related and other compounds that may interfere (positively or negatively) in the separation and identification process(es). Normally appropriate nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of extracts would be carried out to determine the nature of the main substances in a mixture, followed by selection of chromatographic methods to enable separation of fractions.93 These methods may be especially applicable to small druglike molecules, but larger molecular weight substances, such as polysaccharides, can be more challenging. However, these may be elucidated by X-ray crystallography if a good crystal can be obtained.",

Many extracts of plants used traditionally by indigenous people around the globe will, most often, have been prepared using either water or some form of dilute aqueous ethanol for extraction to yield a decoction or tincture. For example, Artemisia annua aqueous extracts are used locally in Malawi to treat patients infected with malaria.94 The main active ingredient is well known to be the lipid-soluble sesquiterpenoid artemisinin, which in pure form is insoluble in water. It came as a real surprise for the chemists involved in the work that, there was not only a detectable amount of artemisinin in aqueous extracts of the A. annua plant samples but also therapeutically relevant amounts of artemisinin (Lutz Heide personal communication to AIG, 2015). The relatively large proportion of active ingredient was undoubtedly due to the presence of surfactant-type components in the plant material that acted as natural solubilizing agents for the water-insoluble artemisinin.",

However, the use of metabolomics to find low-molecular-weight metabolite markers of vaccine effects is just beginning to emerge. Metabolomics simply aims to profile all the metabolites within a biological fluid or tissue. In effect this means that somewhere between 200 and several thousand metabolites are monitored depending on the instrument technology used for screening.",
