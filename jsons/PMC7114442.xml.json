            "text": "Infection of enveloped viruses is initiated by binding of surface proteins with specific receptor(s) on the surface of the cell membrane, which leads to internalization of the virus into cells. The second step of infection following virus attachment is the uncoating of the viral genome into the cytoplasm after the viral envelope has fused with the host membrane. There are two major routes for enveloped viruses to enter host cells; the non-endosomal and the endosomal pathways (Pelkmans and Helenius, 2003, Smith and Helenius, 2004). Both pathways require the release of the viral genome by fusion of the viral envelope with the respective target membrane of the host cells such as the plasma or endosomal membrane, respectively (Matlin et al., 1981). In the non-endosomal pathway, the viral envelope directly fuses with the plasma membrane. Membrane fusion is mediated by a conformational change of the viral glycoprotein, which is induced by its interaction with the corresponding receptor on the host cell surface and/or proteolytic processing (Blumenthal et al., 2002). The endocytic pathway can further differentiate into two well-characterized pathways; those acting via the clathrin-coated pit and the caveolae-mediated lipid raft (Brodsky et al., 2001, Pelkmans and Helenius, 2002). After internalization, viruses require a low-pH environment in the endosome to trigger conformational changes in the viral glycoproteins. The acidic pH environment is also important for proteolytic activation of viral glycoproteins by endosomal proteases (Qiu et al., 2006, Simmons et al., 2005).",

PEDV causes an acute watery diarrhea in suckling piglets, which results in approximately 50% mortality among suckling piglets and reduces the weight among fattening pigs (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980). Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is first recognized in pigs in the United Kingdoms in 1971 (Wood, 1977). Although no evidence of PED is currently reported from Canada, similar coronavirus-like particles were reported from herds in Quebec in 1980 (Turgeon et al., 1980). Since then, outbreaks of PED have been documented in many European and Asian countries such as Czech Republic, Hungary, Korea, the Philippines, China, Italy, Thailand, Germany, Spain, and Japan (Song and Park, 2012). Recently, PEDV is spreading rapidly in swine farms in the United States, resulting in high mortality in piglets in more than 17 states (Mole, 2013).",

            "text": "As typical for the Alphacoronavirus, the PEDV spike (S) protein encounters virus entry into host cells by interacting with its receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N (APN), in porcine enterocytes and by mediating membrane fusion with host cell membranes (Li et al., 2007, Oh et al., 2003). Upon receptor binding, several coronaviruses in Alphacoronavirus enter cells via endocytosis. For example, extensive studies on hCoV-229E have shown that upon binding with the human APN receptor, it is taken up in lipid rafts and enters via caveolae-dependent endocytosis (Nomura et al., 2004). Inside the endosome, cellular proteases that are active in a low-pH environment facilitate membrane fusion (Kawase et al., 2009). Similarly, TGEV binds to porcine APN (Weingartl and Derbyshire, 1994), and has been shown to enter MDCK cells over-expressing porcine APN via endocytosis and acidification of the intracellular compartment facilitated membrane fusion (Hansen et al., 1998). FIPV also requires acidification of endosomes for successful entry (Takano et al., 2008). Inhibition of FIPV infection with nystatin, a pharmacological reagent that causes caveolae to flatten and disrupt the coat structure, and dynamin 2 inhibitor suggests that FIPV entry might actually involve some types of caveolae-dependent endocytosis (Van Hamme et al., 2008).",

In this study, we studied the entry mechanism of PEDV by measuring virus infectivity in the presence of chemical inhibitors and co-localization of PEDV with endocytic pathway markers. We found that PEDV infection was diminished by treatment with chloropromazine (CPZ) and lysosomotropic agents. In addition, we also investigated that PEDV required serine-like proteases for their entry through endocytosis and for cell\u2013cell fusion. Taken together, our findings reveal that PEDV enters Vero cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and requires serine proteolysis during infection.",

The trypsin-induced syncytium formation is corroborated by Li et al. when pAPN-expressing MDCK cells were infected with PEDV in the presence of trypsin (Li et al., 2007).

As shown in Fig. 1\n, we found that PEDV could infect Vero cells even without trypsin treatment. Initial infection was confirmed as early as 8 hpi on both trypsin and non-trypsin conditions. The number of infected cells in both conditions was similar but the spreading into adjacent cells was faster in the presence of trypsin. At 24 hpi, more than 95% of the cell monolayer had formed large multi-nucleated cells. In sharp contrast, PEDV growth without exogenous trypsin did not involve syncytial spread. At 48 hpi, more than 99% of the cells showed signs of infection, but still no cytopathic effect (CPE) was found. These results confirm that trypsin catalyzes PEDV S protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion as demonstrated previously (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988, Park et al., 2011). Based on these observations, we concluded that an exogenous protease, like trypsin, was necessary to induce cell\u2013cell fusion in PEDV-infected Vero cells but not essentially required for virus-cell entry. So, we hypothesized that PEDV entry into Vero cells under the trypsin-free condition most likely occurred inside endosomal compartments where cellular proteases might operate similar to trypsin, facilitating S-mediated fusion of PEDV with the endosomal membrane.",

For the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we used either (i) CPZ, which is known to abolish the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles by interfering with the interaction of the adapter protein AP-2 with the clathrin-coated pit lattice and thus inhibiting clathrin-dependent endocytosis or (ii) hypertonic 0.45% sucrose, which inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis by inducing dispersion of clathrin lattices on the plasma membrane. For the inhibition of caveolae-mediated endocytosis, we used nystatin, a polyene antifungal agent that interacts with cholesterol and inhibits the lipid raft/caveolin pathway.

Tf is transported into the cells in a vesicle by receptor-mediated clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathway. CT-B specifically binds to glycolipid monoganglioside at the plasma membrane and is internalized and delivered to the Golgi complex through caveolae-mediated endocytosis pathway (Nichols, 2002). Vero cells were incubated with fluorescence-labeled PEDV along with each marker, and then evaluated their subcellular localizations by confocal microscopy. At 4 h later, both endocytic markers, CT-B and Tf, were located in the cytoplasm. Co-localization was observed only between PEDV and Tf (Fig. 4A), but not with CT-B (Fig. 4B). To further confirm these findings, Vero cells were treated with CPZ and nystatin prior to PEDV inoculation. As shown in Fig. 4C, PEDV and Tf were co-localized in the cytoplasm in both nystatin and mock-treated, but not in CPZ-treated Vero cells. Both PEDV and Tf were found only on cell surface indicating that clathrin-mediated endocytosis was successfully (or completely) inhibited by CPZ treatment.

Both lysosomotropic reagents showed strong inhibitory effects on production of progeny PEDV, especially with 60% reduction at 10 hpi output titer by NH4Cl (Fig. 5A).

PEDV infectivity was only slightly facilitated by trypsin treatment and trypsin treatment does not overcome the inhibitory effect of NH4Cl and CPZ.

Both approaches provided similar conclusions on the mechanism of PEDV cell entry. The infection inhibition assay using various substrates that interfere with endocytosis or lysosomotropic agents revealed that PEDV enters Vero cells via clathrin-mediated endocytic uptake and delivery of virus to an acidic intracellular compartment. More interestingly, we found that PEDV requires serine proteolytic processes in early stages of infection. The serine proteolysis activates PEDV entry in independent manner with acidic pH environment, but did not bypass the infection reduction by lysosomotropic agents.",

It raises possibility that PEDV S could fuse with plasma membrane by activation with proteases to deliver their genomes into cells. However, our study demonstrated that PEDV entry occurs without exogenous proteases. Although PEDV infection was likely facilitated by trypsin treatment as demonstrated earlier, PEDV also propagated even without trypsin (Fig. 1). Based on our results, we could confirm that exogenous protease, especially trypsin, might be critical factor for cell\u2013cell fusion but not for viral envelope\u2013cell membrane fusion. And also, we could conclude that trypsin is not essentially required for virus entry into Vero cells. Our results encouraged us to hypothesize that PEDV penetration must have been facilitated by fusion of its envelope with the host membrane in a fusion-permissive environment, which most likely occurs inside endosomal compartments. PEDV might take endosomal entry pathway rather than direct fusion. The experiment using various inhibitors supported our hypothesis that PEDV alters endosomal pathway for their entry. PEDV infection was greatly diminished by pre-treatment with CPZ and hypotonic sucrose (Fig. 2). It suggests that PEDV enters Vero cells via clathrin-mediated pathway. Furthermore, co-localization between endocytosed Tf and fluorochrome-labeled PEDV may support conclusion that clathrin mediated endocytic uptake is major pathway for entry (Fig. 4). Our data collectively propose that PEDV enters Vero cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis similar to other coronaviruses.",

It suggests that serine or serine-like proteases in the cytoplasm are involved in facilitating the fusion between PEDV envelope and host endosomal membrane. It is not clear which serine proteases are involved in PEDV entry, however, we are assuming that intracellular serine proteases may cleave the S protein so that induce membrane fusion during infection. As shown in Fig. 6B, inhibitory effect of serine proteases inhibitors was observed when the lysosomotropic reagents were treated, indicating that novel serine protease(s) is involved in PEDV entry with acidic pH independent manner unlike low pH-dependent endosomal cathepsins. In addition, our finding that trypsin treatment is not bypass the infection inhibition with lysosomotropic agents and CPZ as shown in Fig. 7\n, clearly indicates that PEDV entry requires pH-dependent step rather than the presence of pH-dependent proteolytic processing.

It seems like coronavirus S-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion is regulated by different manner from virus\u2013cell fusion. Acidic pH and serine proteolysis are sufficient for virus\u2013cell fusion, in contrast, serine proteolysis and/or unknown other factor(s) which may provide similar condition to low pH, are required for cell\u2013cell fusion at plasma membranes; thus S induces membrane fusion without low pH.",
