Intrabodies can alter protein folding, proteinprotein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA interactions and protein modification. They can induce a phenotypic knockout and work as neutralizing agents by direct binding to the target antigen, by diverting its intracellular traffic or by inhibiting its association with binding partners. They have been largely employed as research tools and are emerging as therapeutic molecules for the treatment of human diseases as viral pathologies, cancer and misfolding diseases. The fast growing bio-market of recombinant antibodies provides intrabodies with enhanced binding specificity, stability and solubility, together with lower immunogenicity, for their use in therapy. This chapter describes the crucial aspects required to express intrabodies in different intracellular compartments of mammalian cells, their various modes of action and gives an update on the applications of intrabodies in human diseases.",

Intrabodies have unique advantages comparing to other knockout gene techniques or RNA interference. First, they can target the antigen in different intracellular compartments including extracellular milieu. Secondly, they are highly specific reagents and are very stable in mammalian cells, especially when expressed in the secretory compartment. In addition, intrabodies can hit a variety of possible targets: (i) specific protein domains, (ii) specific protein-protein interaction sites, (iii) post-translational modifications, (iv) multiple conformational isoforms (oligomers, fibrils etc) and (v) even non protein antigens.",

Intrabodies in the ER behave as intracellular anchors and can be used either to prevent the appearance of receptor proteins on the plasma membrane or to inhibit the secretion of a protein. Similar protein retention in the trans-Golgi has been achieved with a trans-Golgi retention signal (Zhou et al. 1998 ).

Intrabodies have been also targeted to mitochondria. N-terminal presequences are present in most of the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. These sequences are removed once the protein is translocated through the mitochondrial membrane.

So far the single chain variable fragment (scFv) has been the recombinant antibody format more widely used for intrabodies. It contains the complete antigen binding site and it consists of the variable domains of the immunoglobulin heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains linked with a flexible polypeptide which prevents dissociation. The resulting molecule is a monovalent antibody fragment, with a molecular weight of about 30 kDa compared to the 150 kDa of the full-length antibody. Other formats that have been successfully expressed inside cells are recombinant bispecific and tetravalent antibody fragments made of two scFvs linked through the second and third heavy chain constant domain, named intradiabodies. These bispecific intrabodies have been designed for simultaneous trapping of two endothelial transmembrane receptors in the same compartment (Jendreyko et al. 2005) . ScFv is not the minimal size for functional antibody fragments. Other fragments made of one variable domain such the single VL and VH domains are the smallest functional fragments derived from immunoglobulin light and heavy chains. The so-called VHH single domain antibody fragments, derived from naturally occurring heavy-chain antibodies devoid of light chain present in the immune system of camelids, retain the antigen specificity of the whole antibody and have excellent properties of solubility, stability and expression in mammalian cells, aside from the absence of intra-domain disulfide bonds (Hamers-Casterman et al. 1993; Wesolowski et al. 2009 ). They are easily produced as recombinant antibodies, much smaller in size and can be forged into new multispecific and multivalent reagents with enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Due to their smaller size, they possess a great capacity to form long finger-like extensions that can potentially target cryptic epitopes that are difficult for intact antibodies or scFv fragments to reach.",

            "text": "Antibody fragments can be potentially targeted to any subcellular compartment, but their folding performance and stability can be limited by the micro-environmental intracellular conditions of the compartment where they are directed to. Thus, a major issue raised in the initial phase of work on intrabodies was the limited half life of antibody and antibody domains and their tendency to aggregate when expressed in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. Studies on targeting of scFv fragments showed, in fact, that the expression levels of the retargeted antibody domains may vary and the cytoplasm may be considered the worst case (Cattaneo and Biocca 1999) . In general, intrabodies expressed in the secretory compartment are more stable than those expressed in the cytoplasm. This is due to the fact that intradomain disulfide bonds, which contribute 4-6 Kcal mol -1 to the stability of the antibody domain, do not form in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm . As a consequence of the lower stability, some scFvs tend to misfold and aggregate as insoluble proteins. Notwithstanding this fact, it is worth noting that in many cases cytoplasmic-targeted intrabodies bind the antigens and maintain their in vivo functional activity (Cardinale et al. 2001) . A recent comparative study between the cytoplasmic expression in mammalian cells of well characterized single-chain variable fragments and camelid VHHs, selected from antibody libraries based on similar scaffolds, have outlined the physico-chemical determinants that correlate with enhanced intracellular solubility. Soluble expression in the cytoplasm appears to be influenced by the complementary determining regions (CDRs) content and by the overall charge and hydropathicity of the intrabody sequence (Kvam et al. 2010 ).",

            "text": "This issue is very important and during the last years many selection strategies have been developed to improve stability, solubility and functional properties of antibody fragments under conditions of intracellular expression. Two different strategies have been followed: the knowledge-based and the selection-based approaches. The former relies on the introduction of educated mutations that stabilize pre-existing antibody fragments in order to obtain a \"super-framework\" (Jung and Pl\u00fcckthun 1997; W\u00f6rn et al. 2000; Monsellier and Bedouelle 2006) . The second approach exploits the availability of different antibody libraries for selection of the best functional molecules for intracellular expression (Hudson and Souriau 2003) . For the expression in the cytoplasm, new human phage antibody libraries have been generated based on single framework optimized for intracellular expression (Philibert et al. 2007 ). On the other hand, highly stable ribosome-display libraries, based on Escherichia coli SecM translation arrest mechanism, have been used for isolating scFvs that are stable under reducing conditions (Contreras-Mart\u0131\u0144ez and DeLisa 2007). Moreover, antibody-antigen intracellular selection methods have been also developed for the isolation of intrabodies able to efficiently interact with the antigen in vivo. To this aim an in vivo yeast two-hybrid system has been realized, described as intracellular antibody capture (IAC) technology (Visintin et al. 1999) . This approach combines a first round of in vitro selection of scFvs with a second round of in vivo screening of selected intrabodies and allows the isolation of antibody domains with no need to use purified antigens. IAC technology has recently allowed the direct in vivo intracellular selection of conformation-sensitive anti-oligomeric scFvs against the Alzheimer's amyloid \u03b2 peptide (Meli et al. 2009 ). Another procedure for direct in vivo selection of antigen-specific intrabodies, which utilises a single domain antibody format and is based on a predefined intrabody consensus framework has been described (IAC 2 ) (Tanaka and Rabbitts 2003) and further developed (IAC 3 ) (Tanaka and Rabbitts 2010) . This new protocol allows the isolation of functional VH and VL domains from different libraries in four steps, including confirmation of functional intrabodies in mammalian cells.",

In this last case also non-neutralizing antibodies, according to in vitro biochemical criteria, can be effective when expressed in vivo. This can be obtained by adding to the intrabody a specific targeting signal, as the ER retention signal KDEL, which confers to the antigen-antibody complex the retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. In some described cases, intrabodies divert the antigen to the proteasome degradation pathway (Cardinale et al. 2003; Filesi et al. 2007 ). As mentioned before, intrabodies have different folding performance and stability particularly when they are expressed in the cytoplasm. In this compartment, intradomain disulfide bonds do not form and intrabodies complexed to their corresponding antigen tend to misfold and aggregate. This has been demonstrated for cytoplasmic, nuclear and secretory intrabodies. In the first case they aggregate and form aggresomes in a perinuclear location, whereas in the secretory compartments the antigen-antibody complexes are retrotranslocated from the ER, ubiquitinated and finally proteasome degraded (Filesi et al. 2007) .",

During the aggregation process of an amyloidogenic protein many different conformers, including misfolded monomers, oligomers and fibrils are generated (Chiti and Dobson 2006) . In the neurodegenerative diseases the aggregation occurs in the brain and is accompanied by cognitive decline. The available therapeutic treatments to slow or prevent these devastating disorders are still not effective, so the development of new molecular therapies that target the pathogenic proteins are urgently needed. In particular, there is great interest in searching new molecules able to prevent unfolding and aggregation either by stabilizing the native state of the amyloidogenic precursors or by disassembling amyloid fibrils. Conformational specific antibodies are very promising agents against neurodegenerative disorders, because they can be raised against different structural isoforms of an amyloidogenic antigen, act at the protein level and can be used in an intrabody approach (Fig. 9.1) . Interestingly, although there are no obvious structural or sequence identities among proteins that Intrabodies that distinguish native and misfolded conformations can be generated and used either to re-route the misfolding-prone protein from its site of aggregation and, eventually, divert it to the proteasome pathway or to inhibit different stages of the aggregation process. This latter mode of action can be achieved through (i) stabilization of the monomeric isoform, (ii) inhibition of oligomerization, (iii) neutralization of potentially toxic oligomeric species, (iv) inhibition of fibril formation and (v) clearing of preformed aggregates cause neurodegenerative diseases, it has been shown that conformation-dependent antibodies, raised against a molecular mimic of A\u03b2 oligomers, react with oligomers derived from different kinds of amyloidogenic proteins, such as \u03b1-synuclein, polyglutamine, prions, etc. inhibiting the toxicity associated to these aggregates (Kayed et al. 2003) . This finding indicates that the conformational structure rather than the amino acid sequence of these misfolded isoforms is probably the key factor for their neurotoxicity.",

Paganetti et al. generated intrabodies directed to the EFRH peptide adjacent to the \u03b2-secretase cleavage site of human amyloid precursor protein (APP) (scFv-\u03b21). Expression of scFv-\u03b21 along the secretory pathway shields the \u03b2secretase cleavage site and inhibits the formation of toxic A\u03b2. The KDEL version of the same intrabody is more effective, since it anchors APP in the ER preventing its appearance on the plasma membrane (Paganetti et al. 2005) . In another study, the expression of anti-nicastrin intrabodies disrupts the proper folding and glycosylation of the endogenous nicastrin. This protein is required for the stability of the \u03b3-secretase complex. As a result, the anti-nicastrin intrabody suppresses the \u03b3-secretase enzymatic activity in vivo (Hayashi et al. 2009 ).",

So far, intrabody applications against prion disorders have been targeted to the endogenous prion protein (PrP C ). Anti-prion KDEL-8H4 scFv fragments were generated and stably expressed in a neuronal cell line susceptible to scrapie infection. Its intracellular expression causes a marked impairment of prion maturation and translocation towards the membrane compartment, with a strong reduction of the PrP C membrane fraction. As a consequence, the pathogenic scrapie isoform (PrP Sc ) does not form and accumulate in infected cells . Moreover, mice, intracerebrally injected with a lysate derived from KDEL-8H4 expressing cells infected with scrapie, neither develop scrapie clinical sign nor brain damage, demonstrating effective treatment . The secretory version of the same intrabody (Sec-8H4), able to recognize PrP C in the secretory pathway, strongly inhibits PrP Sc accumulation in 139A scrapie strain infected cells. By analysing its mode of action, it was found that PrP C total level is markedly reduced due to a selective re-routing of PrP C to the proteasome pathway. Moreover, Sec-8H4 intrabody impairs the secretion of endogenous prion molecules associated to exosomes-like vesicles, a potential spreading route for prion infectivity (Filesi et al. 2007) . A drastic reduction of PrP Sc accumulation was also obtained by co-culturing cells secreting anti-prion scFv fragments with chronically scrapie infected neuroblastoma cells (Donofrio et al. 2005 ).",

It is caused by the aggregation of mutated forms of huntingtin (htt) protein which present abnormally long polyglutamine (poliQ) sequences at the N-terminal. Cytoplasmic intrabodies directed against the poly-proline region, flanking the polyglutamine region at the C-terminal side of htt, inhibit cell death and aggregation in transiently transfected HEK293 cells, while intrabodies to the polyQ region are cytotoxic and ineffective, because they accelerate aggregate formation and apoptotic cell death (Khoshnan et al. 2002) . A phage-derived C4 scFv against the N-terminal portion of htt reduces aggregation and toxicity in cell cultures, in neuronal organotypic slice cultures and in a Drosophila model of HD (Murphy and Messer 2004; Wolfgang et al. 2005; McLear et al. 2008) . Another potent intrabody against mutant htt, when expressed in the striatum of HD mice via adenoviral infection, reduces neuropil aggregate formation and ameliorates neurological symptoms ). Interaction of this intrabody with mutant huntingtin increases the ubiquitination of cytoplasmic htt and its degradation, indicating that intrabody-mediated re-routing of htt to the proteasome pathway is the mechanism underlying the protective activity ( Fig. 9.1) . Furthermore, an intrabody against the N-terminal htt, V L 12.3 and another, Happ1, which recognizes the proline rich domain of htt, both prevents htt aggregation and inhibits toxicity in an immortalized striatal cell model of HD by different mechanisms (Southwell et al. 2008) . Tested both in brains of five mouse models of HD, V L 12.3 increases severity of phenotype and mortality in two models, while Happ1 treatment ameliorates motor, cognitive and neuropathological symptoms (Southwell et al. 2009 ).",

In the beginning, they have been used to target proteins of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) . Intrabodies equipped with a ER retention signal were employed against the viral coat proteins gp120 and gp41. They caused inhibition of virus replication and syncytial formation (Marasco et al. 1993; Zhou et al. 1998 ). Inhibition of early and late events of HIV-1 life cycle was also obtained by expression of cytoplasmic intrabodies directed against the matrix protein p17 (Levin et al. 1997 ) and against proteins involved in replication (reverse transcriptase and Vif). Camelized single-domain intrabodies efficiently interact with HIV-1 Vif protein and neutralize Vif-mediated proviral integration in non permissive cells (Aires da Silva et al. 2004) . Moreover, intrabodies that block regulatory proteins, such as Tat and Rev have been used to inhibit HIV-1 replication. A cytosolic anti-Tat scFv fragment modified with a C-terminal human C kappa domain to increase cytoplamic stability inhibits Tat-mediated long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation and HIV-1 infection in transformed lymphocytes (Mhashilkar et al. 1995; Bai et al. 2003 ) and a cytosolic anti-Rev scFv fragment inhibits HIV-1 replication in HeLa-T4 cells (Duan et al. 1994) .

(a) Re-routing the antigen from its functional location, in this case by adding the ER-retention signal KDEL at the C-terminus of the intrabody. The retention sequence KDEL is specifically recognized by the ERD2 receptor inside the cis-Golgi. The complex formed by the KDEL-tagged intrabody and the target protein binds to the ERD2 receptors, is transported through the Golgi back to the ER, where it is released. (b) Inhibition of functional protein-protein interaction. (c) Direct inhibition of the native target protein. (d) Re-routing the antigen antibody complex or the prone-misfolded antigen to proteasome degradation. (e) Inhibition of different conformers.",
