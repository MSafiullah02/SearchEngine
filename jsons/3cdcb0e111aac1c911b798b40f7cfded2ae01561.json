However, it would be best to conduct both reactions within a single tube for convenience and, more importantly, to prevent aerosol contamination, which happens when the reaction mixture has to be exposed to the environment midway through the protocol. Hence, we tried to execute both the RT-RAA and CDetection concurrently within a single tube. However, the combination resulted in a drastic decrease in sensitivity ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. S7 ). Therefore, in order to keep both the RT-RAA and CRISPR reactions within a single tube, we executed the RT-RAA reaction within the tube while keeping the CDetection reagents within the cap of the tube for 30 minutes, following which, the CDetection reagents were spun down into the tube for nucleic-acid detection, and the resultant reaction mixture was imaged for fluorescence.",

Thus, to investigate the virus handling process, we produced pseudoviruses by packaging the target sequences of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV into actual lentivirus particles (Supplementary Fig. S8 ). These pseudoviruses were diluted serially and treated with either virus genome extraction kits (spin column) or lysis buffer, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the spin column treatment gave a lower detection limit of 1 \u00d7 10 4 copies/mL (Fig. 1e) . On the other hand, the lysis buffer offered higher usability, but raised the detection limit to 5 \u00d7 10 4 copies/mL (Fig.  1f) . Owing to the difference in detection limit between spin column and lysis buffer, we suggest using the spin columns in hospitals, and using the lysis buffer for pointof-care testing (POCT).",
