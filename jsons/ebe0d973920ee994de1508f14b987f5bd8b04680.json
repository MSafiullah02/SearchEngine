This study aims to assess the relative risk of hospitalization due to RTI in winter and summer seasons for different types of CHD. All children born in Sweden and under the age of two, in 2006-2011, were included. Heart defects were grouped according to type. Hospitalization rates for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and RTI in general were retrieved from the national inpatient registry. The relative risk of hospitalization was calculated by comparing each subgroup to other types of CHD and otherwise healthy children. The relative risk of hospitalization was increased for all CHD subgroups, and there was a greater increase in risk in summer for the most severe CHD. This included RSV infection, as well as RTI in general. The risk of hospitalization due to RTI is greater for CHD children. Prophylactic treatment with palivizumab, given to prevent severe RSV illness, is only recommended during winter. We argue that information to healthcare staff and parents should include how the risk of severe infectious respiratory tract illnesses, RSV and others, is present all year round for children with CHD.",

            "text": "This study shows that children with CHD have an increased risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection as well as RTI in general, in summer as well as winter. The risk increased further in summer, especially for the most severe heart conditions. Respiratory tract infections are common in early childhood, with RSV being the most common pathogen. Influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses and human bocaviruses can also be detected in young children who are admitted to hospital with respiratory tract symptoms [4, 5] . In this study, we chose to study hospitalization rates for RSV infection and RTI in general, in order to cover all types of viruses that affect young CHD children. The pattern of risk of hospitalization was similar for all types of RTI, with an elevated risk during summer for the most severe cases. In our study, 4.3 % of children with CHD who were infected by RSV during the winter were hospitalized, while only 0.7 % of RSV-infected children without CHD were hospitalized. In summer, 0.4 % of RSV-infected children with CHD were hospitalized, compared to 0.05 % of RSVinfected children without CHD. These figures were similar for RTI in general. Among children with CHD who were infected with general RTI, hospitalization rates were 5.0 % in the winter and 3.0 % in the summer; children without CHD who were infected by RTI in general had hospitalization rates of 0.7 % in the winter and 0.3 % in the summer. The individual risk of any child being hospitalized for RSV was approximately 17.2/1000 (1.7 %) during the first year of life, according to a recent Swedish study [20] . Our study presents lower risk estimations for non-CHD children, but greatly increased risk for children with CHD.",

            "text": "Prophylactic treatment with palivizumab reduces hospitalization rates and the severity of RSV infection in children with congenital heart defects [9, 11, 21] . This prophylactic treatment is only recommended during the winter, according to the Swedish national guidelines for the study period, and includes children less than six months of age with congenital heart defects, such as Down syndrome with non-operated shunt defects, and shunt defects with heart failure. Children 1 year of age with univentricular heart defects in status post-bidirectional Glenn-operation, children with additional lung disease and pulmonary hypertension and those waiting for transplantation were also included. Prophylaxis with palivizumab is individually prescribed to each child with CHD who fulfills the indications for prophylactic treatment according to the guidelines. The overall risk of RSV hospitalization for CHD children during winter was lower than the risk hospitalization due to RTI in general. Thus, one can argue that the prophylactic treatment for RSV was effective. Additionally, according to our results, the strategy of RSV prophylactic treatment seems to lower the risk of hospitalization among the most severe cases during the winter. Perhaps, these children are less likely to be missed in the prophylactic treatment program by the pediatric cardiologist. In a previous study, we found that almost half the CHD patients had delays to the start of prophylactic treatment, but this accounted mainly for children with systemic-pulmonary shunt defects [22] . Since children with less severe forms of CHD have a higher risk of RSV hospitalization in the winter than the more severe cases of CHD, the present study indicates that even the less severe forms of CHD carry a substantial risk of hospitalization. Prophylactic respiratory syncytial virus treatment with palivizumab is both expensive and painful, and is recommended when RSV incidence is at its highest level [23, 24] . In our study, there were a low number of RSV-infected CHD children during the summer. Rather than suggesting extensive prophylactic treatment, we would like to stress the overall vulnerability for these children, including the risks of RSV infection as well as severe RTI in general, throughout the whole year. Information to parents and healthcare staff must include the risk of severe viral RTI during winter season but also in summer. We also argue that seasonal and regional variations in the onset of the RSV epidemic should indicate when to start treatment, rather than a specific date.",

            "text": "Testing for RSV is possible in all hospitals in Sweden all year round, but there are regional and seasonal variations in RSV testing. As the treatment is similar for all types of RTI, it is of little importance to the clinician whether the child has RSV or not, so not all affected children are tested. Only the tested cases are reported to the Swedish Public Health Agency [25] , and the agency only collected data on the numbers of RSV infections during the winter season and published weekly on their Web site. Waiting for this reporting to start may delay prophylactic treatment and RSV protection for children with CHD. We argue for local testing and reporting to pediatric cardiologists, as well as to the Swedish Public Health Agency. Testing for RSV can be less common during summer, so there is a risk of underreporting. This must account for CHD children as well as non-CHD children. RSV infections can occur sporadically throughout the year, especially in areas with colder weather throughout the year, or areas with small seasonal changes in the climate [13] . However, prophylaxis with palivizumab in the summer, when RSV prevalence is generally low in Sweden, cannot be recommended. In countries with subtropical climates, the RSV season can last up to ten months, so the period for giving prophylaxis may follow the local epidemiology [26] . The Swedish National Inpatient Registry does not provide information on whether or not a child has received prophylactic treatment, which limits this study. However, the nationwide setting of this study with a large number of cases covering a long period of time is a strength and rules out the difference in testing and decreases the impact of the annual variation of RSV in the study. We chose to study RSV in particular and RTI in general, to eliminate the risk of under-reporting of RSV cases, as they are most likely included in the group of children with general RTI.",
