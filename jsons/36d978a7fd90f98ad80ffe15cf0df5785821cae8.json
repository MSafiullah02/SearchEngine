This pandemic has affected all aspects of daily life with far-reaching implications, especially in most aspects of healthcare. Practice of surgery across the globe is in a standstill as of now. When we restart surgical practices across world, we have to bring new protocols and practices in place to combat the transmission. This article discusses the major changes in surgical practice, which need to be brought in. This article is based on scientific information about transmission of virus and experiences of some of the authors from China, a country which successfully dealt with and contained the virus outbreak.",

The COVID-19 epidemic has spread very quickly. Even as we write this manuscript, nearly 500,000 confirmed cases have been identified worldwide, and nearly 25,000 people have died [2] . Experience from China demonstrates that with highly effective contact tracing and case isolation, outbreaks of COVID-19 can be brought under control within 3 months [3] . Healthcare workers are on the front lines of caring for patients with COVID-19 and have very high risk of exposure to the virus. Shortages of protective equipment and knowledge regarding COVID-19 are causing infections in healthcare workers [4] . As of February 11, 2020, more than 1700 healthcare workers have been infected in China [5] . In Italy, 2026 (9%) of the COVID-19 cases (as of March 15) occurred in healthcare workers [6] . However, there was no documented infection in 31 medical teams comprised of more than 42,000 doctors and nurses sent from other provinces to Hubei [7] . This strongly suggests that adequate knowledge about disease transmission and use of protective gear and infection control protocols are essential to prevent spread of infection among healthcare workers.",

Patients who will face lifethreatening consequences if treatment is delayed should be prioritized for outpatient visit, phone call, or virtual consultation by a member of the surgical team [9] . From China's experience, it is advisable to set up a separate triage area or fever clinic to screen for respiratory symptoms in any surgical patient. Patients with respiratory symptoms should call before they leave home, so staff can be prepared to care for them when they arrive [10] . Any patient with respiratory symptoms and flu-like symptoms should visit the fever clinic in advance. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be assigned private rooms with door closed [11] and should be provided surgical face masks or face masks without exhalation valve. Social distancing is essential within clinics and hospitals. Doctors and patients should stay 6 ft apart except during examinations; it may be necessary to forego all but the most essential elements of the physical exam to minimize risk of transmission.",

The second category is without a clear epidemiological history and shows three of the clinical manifestations (fever and/or respiratory symptoms, with the typical findings in the chest CT. The blood count will be as described above [14] . Confirmed and suspected patients have a higher risk of severe events that may require admission to the intensive care unit, ventilation support, and death [15] . Elective surgeries for these patients should be rescheduled, and they should be assessed daily. For high-risk patients, surgeons should consider both medical and logistical needs. For low-risk patients, elective surgeries should not be abandoned unless there are constrained health resources. For cancer patients who have to delay surgery, alternative treatment approaches to delay surgery can be considered, such as neoadjuvant chemotherapy or additional chemotherapy [16] .",

            "text": "The logistics of triage for cancer surgery is challenging. From the recommendations of the Society of Surgical Oncology, decisions must be made on an individual case basis considering the biology of each cancer, alternative treatment options, and waiting time for rescheduled surgery. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) advises to postpone nonurgent surgeries during the beginning of the pandemic of COVID-19. They have classified surgeries into various tiers according to the urgency of surgery. Up to Tier 2b (most elective surgeries like hernia), they are advising postponing of surgery. For Tier 3a and 3b, where most cancer surgeries will fall, ACS is not advising postponement at the moment though it may change [16] . Patients undergoing elective surgery should be given reasonable recommendations regarding follow-up, and patient should be shifted to high care facility if COVID-19 is suspected, and test should be ordered. According to guidelines from the Indian Council of Medical Research, all high-risk patients undergoing elective surgery (All symptomatic contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case should be tested once between day 5 and day 14 of coming in his/her contact) should undergo PCR test for COVID-19 before surgery [20].",

(2) If the patient's RT PCR test is positive, then the patient needs to be transferred to the isolation ward to complete the preoperative preparation. Elective surgery should be deferred until the patient recovers. If we have to operate emergently on such patients for any reasons, all the precautions mentioned earlier for operating COVID-19positive cases as emergency should be strictly followed. The tertiary protection measures should be taken during the anesthesia and operation. After the operation, patients are returned to the isolation area.",

In particular, medical staff in operating theater should avoid exposure to aerosols generated while using electrosurgical equipment. There are many examples that viruses do survive in surgical smoke created by electrosurgical instruments [21, 22] . Though it is not proven that coronavirus can be transmitted via surgical smoke, it may be worthwhile to take precaution until we have evidence it does not. To reduce the hazards, surgical smoke should be minimized by suction device, and electrosurgical equipment should be used at the lowest effective power. In suspected cases, laparoscopy should be avoided as pneumoperitoneum high-pressure trocar leaks enhance the risk of exposure to aerosol to operating theater staff. Surgeons and nurses should avoid injuries such as stab wounds and needle stick injuries. All PPE is only used in the isolated area, and it is forbidden to leave the isolated area while wearing PPE. Some airborne transmission happened in Wuhan because healthcare workers initially had little knowledge of the virus. After using the strict management measures for operating theater, airborne transmission ceased.",
