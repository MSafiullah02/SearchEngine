First, we speculate that the girl's father may be infected by her, considering the fact that he only had a short stay in Hubei province and did not have close contact with anybody except the family members. More importantly, he became symptomatic and diagnosed with COVID\u201019 just 5 days (appeared to be the appropriate incubation time) after meeting his daughter. It has been usually ignored that the source of infection could be children, so active monitoring of children back from Hubei province by the local health department should be conducted. Second, the difference of the disease severity between the child and his father indicated that children infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 are likely to present milder manifestations. The inapparent infection with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 increases the difficulty of the prevention and control of the disease, so quarantine for children at home is necessary. Moreover, the RT\u2010PCR assay for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in the child's throat swab sample has been positive from January 22nd to February 12th, which indicated the child is shedding virus for no less than 20 days, thus the isolation period for suspected child cases should be longer than 14 days. Further, oral intake of oseltamivir may not reduce the replication of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.",

It helps us to recognize that children infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may be more likely to develop mild symptoms and could be potential sources of infection. The isolation period for suspected child cases should be longer than 14 days. Further research with large sample size is urgently needed to investigate the feature of children infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.",
