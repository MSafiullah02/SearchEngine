Viruses can infect members of domains Bacteria, Eukarya, and Archaea. Compared with the bacterial and eukaryal domains, little is known about archaeal domain and their viruses (Snyder et al., 2013). Archaeal domain is composed of two major kingdoms: Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota while the viruses of Archaea are identified prior to appreciation of the existence of domain Archaea itself (Woese et al., 1990). Interestingly, Archaea appear to contain a combination of bacterial and eukaryotic features. The cell structure and metabolic functions of Archaea more closely resemble Bacteria, whereas the information processing in Archaea, such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication, transcription, and translation, share more similarities with Eukarya (Snyder et al., 2013).",

The approximate equimolarities [A]\u2248[T] and [G]\u2248[C] for single stranded DNA molecules had experimentally been determined, which was later proved theoretically that these equalities (referred to as the second parity rule, or PR2) should be observed at the equilibrium state, when mutational and selective pressures are symmetric with respect to the 2 DNA strands (Nec\u015fulea and Lobry, 2007). On the other hand, DNA has at least two functions: (i) to provide special sequences for encoding gene products or for regulating transcription and (ii) to provide for genome replication and segregation (Karlin et al., 1994). While the former requires some sequence specificity, the latter may be mostly DNA structure specific. The genome putatively requires compositional flexibility and balance and conveys controls and information in terms of both DNA structure and sequence. GC skews and AT skews are widely encountered in prokaryotic genomes, while the switch in skew direction generally occurs at the origin and terminus of replication (Nec\u015fulea and Lobry, 2007). Strand compositional asymmetry may be the consequence of differences in replication synthesis of the leading versus lagging strand, on differences between template and coding strand associated with transcription-coupled repair mechanisms or deamination events, on differences in promoter and gene density between the two strands, on differences in residue and codon biases depending perhaps on gene function, expression level, or operon organization, or on differences in single-base or context-dependent mutational rates (Mr\u00e1zek and Karlin, 1998). Moreover, whole-genome inverse duplication also contributes to strand asymmetry in bacterial genomes (Sanchez and Jose, 2002, Albrecht-Buehler, 2006, Kong et al., 2009). It has been demonstrated that DNA replication-associated and transcription-associated mutation bias and/or selective codon usage bias (CUB) may affect the strand nucleotide composition asymmetrically in eukaryotic genomes (Niu et al., 2003).",

            "text": "All amino acids except Met and Trp are coded by more than one codon within the standard genetic codes, which are called synonymous codons that are not used randomly in intergenome (Grantham et al., 1980, Nakamura et al., 1991, Angellotti et al., 2007). The frequencies of individual synonymous codons are quite variable from genome to genome and within genomes, from gene to gene (Kurland, 1991). Synonymous codon usage, studied in a number of living organisms, has basically proven to be non-random and species-specific. Several factors, including directional mutational bias, translational selection, secondary protein structure, replicational and transcriptional selection, and environmental factors, have been shown to influence codon usage in a variety of organisms (Sau et al., 2007). Synonymous codon usage biases (SCUB) are associated with various biological factors, such as gene expression level, gene length, gene translation initiation signal, protein amino acid composition, protein structure, tRNA abundance, mutation frequency and patterns, and GC compositions (Angellotti et al., 2007). Mutational biases influence the genome base composition, which in turn affects codon usage considerably (Palidwor et al., 2010). Asymmetry in DNA replication and repair of the leading and lagging DNA strands (Sueoka, 1962) creates further codon usage bias. Furthermore, it has been shown that certain types of SCUB are associated with gene expression levels (Holm, 1986). This association is often explained through selection towards translational efficiency (Lavner and Kotlar, 2005), which regards optimization of both translation rate (Varenne et al., 1984) and fidelity (Precup and Parker, 1987). Selection towards codon usage that promotes efficient translation has both local effects on specific genes (Drummond and Wilke, 2009) as well as global effects on the organism\u05f3s fitness. The latter is achieved by promoting rapid recycling of ribosomes, reducing costs wasted on correcting translation errors (Ibba and S\u00f6ll, 1999) and lowering the production of inactive and at times toxic proteins (Zaher and Green, 2009, Wald et al., 2012).",

Quantification of CUB, especially at genomic scale, helps understand evolution of living organisms (Angellotti et al., 2007). Investigation of codon usage patterns and causes of CUB can provide a basis for understanding the viral molecular evolution, particularly the interaction between viruses and their host (Shackelton et al., 2006). After extensive studies in CUB and nucleotide composition of bacterial, yeast, fruit fly and mammals, several researchers focused on codon usage in virus (Mooers and Holmes, 2000). For instance, it has been observed that codon usage preference is related to mutational pressure, G+C content, the route of transmission of the virus and the segmented nature of the genome in human RNA viruses (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003). As to vertebrate DNA viruses, genome-wide mutational pressure, rather than natural selection is the main factor to determine codon usage (Shackelton et al., 2006). The correlation between codon usage and tRNA availability is found in analysis of the bovine papillomavirus type 1(BPV1) late genes (Zhou et al., 1999). It has been reported that codon preference in host genome can also strongly influence replication and gene expression of its corresponding virus (Zhao et al., 2003). The relationship of genotypes, virulence, dinucleotides and codon usage has been investigated in classical swine fever viruses (CSFV) (Pan et al., 2009).",

Sequence similarities between genes of archaeal viruses are generally very limited, and moreover there are no other matches of most predicted genes in public sequence databases (Prangishvili and Garrett, 2004). Almost all isolated archaeal viruses contain a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome with one exception: Halorubrum pleomorphlc virus 1 (HRPV-1) which has been found recently with a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Pietil\u00e4 et al., 2009). In archaeal virus with dsDNA genomes, some codons exist exclusively on one DNA stand while other codons on both DNA strands (Haring et al., 2004). There is a growing interest in Archaea and their viruses because their habitats elucidate the limits where life is possible.",

The \u201ceffective number of codons\u201d (ENC) was often used to measure the non-uniformity of synonymous codon usage, which generates values ranging from 20 for a gene with extreme bias that only one synonymous codon is used for each amino acid, to 61 for a gene with no bias using synonymous codons equally (Wright, 1990). The index GC3S was used to analyze the extent of base composition bias by calculating the fraction of nucleotides G+C at the synonymous third codon position (excluding start codons, Trp and the termination codons). In addition, the frequency of aromatic amino acids (Aromo) in the hypothetical genes was also computed.

According the G+C content, 11 archaeal viruses are divided into 3 groups, which is indicated in Table 1, Table 2. In group 2 with genome G+C content of 25%, most of the preferentially used codons are A- or U-ended codons. On the other hand, C- or G-ended codons are used with higher frequency in the genes from group 3 which harbors two GC rich genomes. As to group 1 with G+C content ranging from 36% to 39%, it seems that A- or U-ended codons are more popular than C- or G-ended codons although this trend is not absolute. In group 3 with GC-rich genome, C- or G-ended codons are used with higher frequency. The above phenomenon is independently summarized in Table 3. As expected, different gene groups have their own A- or U-ended and C- or G-ended codons preference due to compositional constraints. Similar results were obtained by analyzing all valid 320 archaeal virus genes from the 11 genomes as described in Supplementary Table 3. Moreover, in the selected 26 archaeal virus genes, there are 6 amino acids preferring codons ended with U in SIRV1 and SIRV2 of group 2, including Thr (ACU), Phe (UUU), Tyr (UAU), Asn (AAU), Asp (GAU), and Cys (UGU), as well as 4 amino acids preferring codons ended with A, such as Pro (CCA), Lys (AAA), Glu (GAA), and Arg (AGA). Particularly, 7 amino acids prefer codons ended with C in PhiCh1 and HRPV1 of group 3, including Asn (AAC), Asp (GAC), His (CAC), Tyr (UAC), Phe (UUC), Cys (UGC), Ile (AUC), and Leu (CUC), whereas 2 amino acids prefer codons ended with G, such as Gln (CAG) and Glu (GAG), besides Met (AUG) and Trp (UGG). About group 1, 3 amino acids mostly choose codons ended with U, including His (CAU), Tyr (UAU), and Asp (GAU), whereas 3 amino acids mainly choose codons ended with A, including Glu (GAA), Lys (AAA), and Leu (UUA). Similarly, different gene groups have their own A- or U-ended and C- or G-ended codons preference due to compositional constraints. The compositional constraints (or mutational bias) and gene functions are the cause of the bias and the effect of natural selection is slight. Categorizing the genomes as well as genes according to their G+C content will facilitate the analysis of SCUB, especially when compositional bias plays a key role in SCUB. We first validated this method by using two groups of known phages with different G+C content: GC-rich Mycobacterium phage and AT-rich Staphylococcus phage, as described in Supplementary Table 4. SCUB analysis indicated that all the genes of phages with similar G+C content were grouped together in various plots (Supplementary Fig. 1A\u2013C). Interestingly, in the dendroid chart generated by using RSCU of each of the selected 104 genes of Mycobacterium and Staphylococcus phages, all these genes were clearly clustered into the high G+C content group (Mycobacterium phage) and low G+C content group (Staphylococcus phage) (Supplementary Fig. 1D), which is consistent with the fact that compositional bias is the major factor influencing SCUB in both Mycobacterium and Staphylococcus phages (Hassan et al., 2009, Sau et al., 2005).",

The data suggests a high heterogeneity of synonymous codon usage among archaeal virus genes selected. This hypothesis is further supported by the GC3s values for each examined archaeal virus genes, which vary from 8% to 88% with a mean of 47% and S.D. of 0.24. In fact, the average GC3s of three gene groups have significant differences as showed by one-way ANOVA and multiple comparison (both at significant level of 0.01). Multiple comparison also indicated that the average ENC value of group 1 differs from that of group 2 and group 3 respectively while there is no difference between the average ENC value of group 2 and group 3. This is probably because genes in group 2 and group 3 have a high codon usage bias with low ENC values, but genes from these two groups tend to use different codons as discussed above.",

The first principal axis accounts for 48.81% of the total variation. The next three axes account for 8.76%, 7.16% and 5.62% of the variation respectively.

The expected ENC curve shows the situation that codon usage bias is solely due to biased base composition (G+C content). Result showed that points of group 2 mainly lie on GC-poor regions (GC value 0.083 to 0.229) while points of group 3 like to harbor GC-rich regions. The point inside a box represents the only selected gene in genome X with 54% G+C content which is just between group 1 and group 3. Most of the points of ENC values are on or just below the expected curve, which means that genomic GC composition has a profound effect on SCUB although other factors may also affect it. Similar results were found by analyzing all valid 320 archaeal virus genes from the 11 genomes (Supplementary Fig. 2). Moreover, the GC3s values of each gene are plotted against first axis values in COA (\nFig. 3). The patterns of codon usage in different genes also seem to be closely related to GC content on the third codon position. Furthermore, this concept is verified by correlation analysis, which has been implemented to find correlation between synonymous codon usage and nucleotide compositions. It is found that coordinates of axis1, the most important axis accounting for the variation, are negative correlated with GC3s and GC respectively (r=\u22120.959, P<0.01; r=\u22120.899, P<0.01). Taken together, these analyses reveal that most of the SCUB among the selected archaeal virus genes is directly related to the base composition. So, mutational bias may be the major factor accounting for synonymous codon usage variation among genes in these virus genomes.",

To investigate the possible effect on the composition of dinucleotide on codon usage in archaeal virus, the relative abundances of the 16 dinucleotides in the 26 archaeal virus genes were calculated. Due to the variation of genomic GC content, these 26 genes are divided into 3 groups as we talked above. As shown in\nTable 4, although dinucleotides were not randomly distributed and no dinucleotides were present at the expected frequencies, most dinucleotide odds ratios were between 0.78 and 1.23. The relative abundance of CpG in group 2 and UpA, UpC and GpA in group 3 showed the remarkable deviation from the \u201cnormal range\u201d (mean\u00b1S.D.=0.396\u00b10.212, 0.351\u00b10.161, 1.678\u00b10.187 and 1.619\u00b10.107 respectively).

Among the 16 dinucleotides 11 were significantly correlated with the first axis value in COA. Among the 5 dinucleotides that are not correlated with the first axis value, three of them are correlated with the second axis value in COA (\nTable 5). In addition to total dinucleotides, the relative abundances of the 16 intercodon dinucleotides were also calculated (Supplementary Table 5) (Sanchez, 2011). Similarly, significant correlations with the first axis value were observed in 11 out of 16 intercodon dinucleotides. For the 5 intercodon dinucleotides that were not correlated with the first axis, two of them were correlated with the second axis value (Table 5). These observations reveal that the composition of dinucleotides, which are independent of the overall base composition but still the result of differential mutational pressure, also shapes the bias of synonymous codon usage among different archaeal virus ORFs. To further study the possible effect of dinucleotides on codon usage bias, the RSCU value of specific codons, which contain certain dinucleotide, were analyzed. In group 2, among the RSCU value of eight codons that contain the under-represented CpG (CCG, GCG, UCG, ACG, CGC, CGG, CGU and CGA), all (CCG (mean 0.114), GCG (mean 0.366), UCG (mean 0.172), ACG (mean 0.160), CGC (mean 0), CGG (mean 0), CGU (mean 0) and CGA (mean 0)) were markedly suppressed. As to group 3, the RSCU values of twenty four codons that contain UpA (UUA, CUA, AUA, GUA, UAU, UAC, UAA and UAG), UpC (UUC, CUC, AUC, GUC, UCU, UCC, UCA and UCG), and GpA (GAU, GAC, GAA, GAG, UGA, CGA, AGA and GGA) respectively were analyzed. Of these codons, seven codons (UUA (mean 0.017), CUA (mean 0.170), AUA (mean 0.093), GUA (mean 0.171), UAU (mean 0.156), UAA (mean 0) and UAG (mean 0.429)) were suppressed due to the under-representation of UpA. Six codons (UUC (mean 1.901), CUC (mean 3.489), AUC (mean 2.630), GUC (mean 2.563), UCC (mean 1.797) and UCG (mean 1.643)) were over-used because of the over-representation of UpC. Only three codons (GAC (mean 1.537), GAG (mean 1.544), UGA (mean 2.571)) were over-used due to GpA over-representation.",

It should be noted that the distance between gene 20 and other genes in group 3 is farther than that between every two of 21\u201326 genes.

It was found that axis1 is significantly correlated to aromaticity score (r=0.753, P<0.01), indicating that the frequency of aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr and Trp) in the hypothetical translated gene product is also related to the observed variation in codon bias.

The patterns of codon usage vary remarkably among organisms, and also among genes from the same genome (Grocock and Sharp, 2002). Codon frequencies can also vary due to mutational biases as well as because of selection (Ran and Higgs, 2012). DNA sequence data from diverse organisms clearly show that synonymous codons for any amino acid are not used with equal frequency, and these biases are a consequence of natural selection during evolution (Angellotti et al., 2007).

            "text": "First, mutational pressure in double-stranded DNA genome is the situation when AT to GC substitution rates are not equal to GC to AT substitution rates (Sueoka, 1998). Most substitutions in third codon positions are synonymous, so single nucleotide mutations occurring due to mutational pressure may be fixed in these codon positions by the random genetic drift without any selective limitations. When the level of GC content in third codon positions (3GC) for most of coding regions in the prokaryotic genome is higher than 0.5, one can suspect that this genome is under the influence of GC pressure (Khrustalev and Barkovsky, 2010). There should be AT pressure in the genome if 3GC level for most of its coding regions is lower than 0.5. The strongest evidence for GC pressure in genome is the situation when 3GC is higher than 1GC and 2GC for most of its genes. If 3GC level is lower than 2GC and 1GC for most of coding regions, there is AT pressure in this genome. Mutational pressure is caused by the imbalance of mutational processes and reparation. The most common and well-studied mutational processes that contribute into mutational pressure are (Sueoka, 2002, Gros et al., 2002): (i) deamination of cytosine leading to C to U transitions, (ii) deamination of methylcytosine leading to 5-methyl-C to T transitions (Yoon et al., 2003), (iii) oxidation of guanine leading to G to T transversions, (iv) deamination of adenine leading to A to G transitions (Moe et al., 2003), (v) oxidation of thymine leading to T to C transitions, (vi) incorporation of 8-oxo-G into the growing DNA strand opposite adenine followed by the replacement of A with C and the excision of 8-oxo-G leading to A to C transversions. Mono- and poly-functional enzymes involved in reparation of above-mentioned lesions are found in species from all three superkingdoms of life (Gros et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Second, translational selection, selection for optimal speed and accuracy of translation, should exert an influence on SCUB because preferred codons tend to correlate with the most common tRNAs (Ikemura, 1982), allowing for faster, yet accurate, codon recognition and translation of highly expressed genes (Curran and Yarus, 1989). Translation is the process by which ribosomes synthesize proteins in cells. The term \u201ctranslational selection\u201d refers to selection to optimize the translation process itself rather than selection acting on the functions of the proteins produced by translation (Ran and Higgs, 2012). One of the main pieces of evidence for translational selection is the observation that the choice of synonymous codons appears to be influenced by selection in many organisms. Synonymous changes in the gene do not affect the resulting protein but can affect the way that the mRNA is translated by the ribosome. The codon utilization scheme in all the organisms indicates the presence of translation selection as a major force in shaping codon usage (Pal et al., 2013). The speed of translation is one of the key factors on which translational selection can act. Speed has the direct benefit that the proteins required are produced faster, and the secondary benefit that if a given ribosome finishes translation of one sequence, it can begin work on another (Ran and Higgs, 2012). Hence, speeding up translation means that the same total protein production rate can be achieved with fewer ribosomes. The other important aspect of translational selection is accuracy. Occasional mis-pairings between codon and anticodon may occur during translation, leading to errors in the protein sequence, and even incorrect folding in the protein structure that could cause several neurodegenerative diseases (Drummond and Wilke, 2008). Thus, accurate translation of the sites that are evolutionarily conserved between species are particularly important for protein function should be particularly important, and the frequency of the most accurate codons should be higher at the conserved sites (Ran and Higgs, 2012). Our recent studies have indicated that SCUB could be crucial for understanding the etiology of central nervous system neurodegenerative diseases (CNSNDD) especially Alzheimer\u05f3s disease (AD) as well as genetic factors. G and C ending codons were strongly biased in the coding sequences of the proteins related to AD as a result of genomic GC composition constraints, while codons that identified as translationally optimal in the major trend all end in C or G suggested that translational selection should also be taken into consideration additional to compositional constraints (Yang et al., 2010).",

Our results revealed that different archaeal virus species have different genomic G+C content which are ranging from 25% to 61%. This large variation of genomic G+C content of archaeal virus is different with that of other phages such as GC-rich Mycobacterium phage with genomic G+C content of 57\u201369% (Hassan et al., 2009) and AT-rich Staphylococcus phage (Bishal et al., 2012) with genomic G+C content of 30\u201337%. SIRV1 and SIRV2 in group 2 are the unenveloped, stiff-rod-shaped, linear dsDNA viruses isolated from Icelandic Sulfolobus, a novel virus family, the Rudiviridae (Prangishvili et al., 1999). Prangishvili and co-worker proposed that wild-type SIRV1 was unable to propagate in some hosts but surmounted this host range barrier by inducing a host response effecting extensive variation of the viral genome (Prangishvili et al., 1999). SIRV1 and SIRV2 preferred U- and A-ended codons whereas their host Sulfolobus islandicus with low AT % (Nayak, 2013), which could be due to cytosine deamination to uracil, similar to eukaryotic ssDNA viruses. Similarly, C to T transitions may be tolerated only at synonymous sites, resulting in an overabundance of thymine in the genomic sequences, and a corresponding preference for adenine in the coding sequence of SIRV1 and SIRV2. Here, mutational pressure may influence codon bias in SIRV1 and SIRV2 viruses. Meanwhile, Nayak has indicated the dominant role of mutational bias in codon usage pattern of Sulfolobus islandicus\u05f3 genes based on the significant correlation between major trend of synonymous codon usage and GC3s.",

Although the genome sequence and composition differ strongly from those of the Sulfolobus rudiviruses SIRV1 and SIRV2, they all carry the motif AATTTAGGAATTTAGGAATTT near the genome ends which may constitute a signal for the Holliday junction resolvase and DNA replication (Vestergaard et al., 2005). Similarly, C to T transitions may be tolerated only at synonymous sites, resulting in an overabundance of thymine in the genomic sequences, and a corresponding preference for adenine in the coding sequence of ARV1 and AFV1. Here, mutational pressure may influence codon bias in ARV1 and AFV1 viruses. Interestingly, bacteriophage KVP40, a double-stranded DNA phage belonging to a member of the Myoviridae family with an overall G+C content of 42.6%, was isolated from marine water and has been reported to infect eight Vibrio and one Photobacterium species. SCUB in KVP40 was determined to be AT-rich at the third codon positions, and their variations are dictated principally by both mutational bias and translational selection (Sau et al., 2007). Further analysis revealed that the RSCU of KVP40 is distinct from that of its Vibrio hosts, Vibrio cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus.",

It is a head-tail virus containing a contractible tail, thus belonging to the Myoviridae family. It infects the haloalkaliphilic Archaeon Natrialba magadii (Witte et al., 1997), which, to date, is its only known host. All of the previously described archaeal viruses have a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome. Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 (HRPV-1), a newly characterized haloarchaeal virus, has a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genome (Pietil\u00e4 et al., 2009). HRPV-1 and its host Halorubrum sp. were isolated from an Italian (Trapani, Sicily) solar saltern. Quantitative lipid comparison of HRPV-1 and its host revealed that HRPV-1 acquires lipids nonselectively from the host cell membrane, which is typical of pleomorphic enveloped viruses.",

            "text": "Particularly, PhiCh1 and HRPV1 infecting the kingdom Euryarchaeota are different from each other, except preferring C- and G-ended codons, involving the common 9 amino acids as follows: 7 amino acids prefer codons end with C, including including Asn (AAC), Asp (GAC), His (CAC), Tyr (UAC), Phe (UUC), Cys (UGC), Ile (AUC), and Leu (CUC), while 2 amino acids prefer codons end with G, such as Gln (CAG) and Glu (GAG). Besides, the rest amino acids in PhiCh1 still prefer G- or C-ended codons, such as Val (GUC), Gly (GGC), Thr (ACG), Ala (GCG), Lys (AAG), and Ser (UCC), as well as 2 amino acids preferring both G- and C-ended codons, including Pro (CCC/CCG) and Arg (CGC/CGG). However, except Arg, the rest amino acids mostly prefer codons ended with U in HRPV1, only Lys (AAA) prefer codons ended with A. It is well known that ssDNA is prone to rapid cytosine deamination to uracil (Frederico et al., 1990), which may explain the preference for U-ending codons in ssDNA HRPV1. Interestingly, there is a clear association between the number of synonymous codons encoding an amino acid (degeneracy level) and the preference for U or C at the third codon position in HRPV1, where U is preferred over C at the third codon position in amino acids encoded by four codons (i.e. Val, Gly, Pro, Thr, and Ala), while C is preferred over U in amino acids encoded by two and three codons (e.g. Phe, Tyr, His, Asp, Asn, and Ile). Wald et al. (2012) have found by a large-scale analysis to assess SCUB pattern of pyrimidine-ending codons in highly expressed genes in prokaryotes (using genes encoding ribosomal proteins of prokaryotes as proxy for highly expressed genes) that codon-pairs that encode two- and three-fold degenerate amino acids are biased towards C-ending codon while codons encoding four-fold degenerate amino acids are biased towards U-ending codon. This codon usage pattern is widespread in prokaryotes, and its strength is correlated with translational selection both within and between organisms, which could be emphasized in organisms where translational selection is operational in highly expressed genes. This bias is associated with an improved correspondence with the tRNA pool, avoidance of mis-incorporation errors during translation and moderate stability of codon-anticodon interaction, all consistent with more efficient translation. This observation that differences in tRNA abundance cannot explain SCUB is widespread in prokaryotes, where due to the striking absence of tRNAs containing A at the wobble position (Marck and Grosjean, 2002), synonymous codons ending with a pyrimidine residue (U or C) are translated by a single tRNA containing G at the wobble position (Wald et al., 2012). We took advantage of this phenomenon to explore the pattern of HRPV1\u05f3s SCUB that seems independent of tRNA abundance, which is consistent with the conclusion of Wald et al. (2012), focusing on pyrimidine-ending codon. So, we propose that translational selection plays a leading role in HRPV1\u05f3s SCUB and HRPV1 and this could be more close to prokaryotes, which is supported by the result of Marck and Grosjean, Archaea as an \u201cintermediate domain\u201d between Eukarya and Bacteria from the tRNomic point of view (Marck and Grosjean, 2002).",

ENC values of different archaeal virus genes vary from 31.77 to 61, with a mean value of 46.68 and S.D. of 10.36. When comparing with other viruses or phages such as H5N1 influenza virus (mean ENC=50.91) (Ahn et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2005), SARS-covs (mean ENC=44.45) (Gu et al., 2004), and foot-and-mouth virus (mean ENC=51.53) (Zhong et al., 2007), the ENC values for archaeal virus can be either high or low, indicating that not all archaeal virus have the same overall extent of SCUB. For instance, genes in group 1 have a average ENC value of 54.56 which means the seven archaeal virus species (such as SSVK1, SSV2, SSV1, SSVRH, SSV4, ARV1, and AFV1) have low level of SCUB, while genes in both group 2 and group 3 have average ENC value of 36.67 and 38.08, respectively, indicating a much higher extent of SCUB although genes in these two groups tend to use different codons as discussed above. As the selection-mutation-drift model (Paul and Wen-Hsiung, 1986, Bulmer, 1991) said, mutational pressure and translational selection are generally thought to be the main factors that account for SCUB in different organisms. Shackelton et al. (2006) have analyzed the sequenced vertebrate-infecting DNA virus and concluded that SCUB patterns are strongly related with genomic GC content. This work suggests that, in vertebrate-infecting DNA virus, genome-wide mutation, rather than natural selection, is the major factor that determines the SCUB. In this study, a similar conclusion is reached that mutational pressure is the main factor that affects SCUB in different archaeal virus groups due to the general correlation between base composition and SCUB. This concept is also verified by the highly negative correlation between axis1 values and GC3s and the result of ENC-plot (Fig. 2), demonstrating role of codon bias as an important determinant of codon usage.",

            "text": "Subsequently, natural selection, such as gene length, translational selection and gene function, can also account for SCUB in different organisms (Zhou et al., 2005). The phenomenon that genes with similar function although in different viral genomes are more likely to cluster together in COA is revealed in some published results (Gu et al., 2004, Das et al., 2006). In our investigation, it is clear that gene function, albeit with smaller effects, also influence SCUB among these viral genes. Several researches indicated that hydropathy of each mimivirus\u05f3 gene, aromaticity and cysteine content are mostly account for the variation of amino acid usage in mimivirus and foot-and-month disease virus (Zhong et al., 2007, Sau et al., 2006). In our study, the significant positive correlation between aromaticity of each hypothetical polyprotein and SCUB was found (r=0.733, P<0.01). Moreover, the cluster tree generated by the hierarchical clustering method based on the variation in RSCU values among archaeal virus\u05f3 genes showed that the 26 genes were divided into 3 distinct sublineages, corresponding to the three groups (Fig. 4). So, genomic GC content is a dominant factor that affected the classification of archaeal viruses and gene function may also play important role in determining the classification at the level of sublineage although other factors may also involve in.",

            "text": "Furthermore, previous report suggests that CpG under-representation can affect codon usage preference in RNA and small DNA viruses (Karlin et al., 1990). Our results show that codon usage in archaeal virus can also be highly influenced by biases in dinucleotide frequencies. As an example, all CpG containing codons are largely suppressed in genes of group 2. As to group 3, not all codons containing UpC and GpA are over-used. This may be due to the fact that the only gene in HRPV1 with 54% GC content are also included in group 3, which may play an influence on the overall frequencies of dinucleotide. These results can also be explained by mutational pressure. It is well known that the global methylation pattern is a key feature of the methylation landscape of the human genome. Most of the gene bodies and intergenic sequences are globally methylated with the exception of regions called CpG islands (CGIs). CGIs are often unmethylated, but there are increasing number of CGIs being reported to be methylated in normal tissues (Fan and Zhang, 2009). In mammals, the methylated form of cytosine (5-methylcytosine) is hypermutable. 5-methylcytosine is formed by the enzyme DNA methyltransferase operating on a cytosine occurring immediately 5\u2032 of a guanine. One effect of methylation is to increase the rate of spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine to form thymine. It has been estimated that transitions in the methylated CpG dinucleotide occur 8\u201316 times faster than non-CpG transitions (Gaffney and Keightley, 2008). The deficit of CpG dinucleotides in the gene coding sequences of archaeal virus (especially SIRV1 and SIRV2) is largely attributed to the hypermutability of methylated CpGs to UpGs (or CpAs in the complementary strand). Since, CpGs in CGIs are often unmethylated and their mutations are rare, the deficiency of CpG can be considered an influence of mutation. Our results also showed that the synonymous SCUB in archaeal virus\u05f3 genes of group 3 are ordered by the third codon position as follows: C>G>U>A, which is in accord with Zeeberg\u05f3s results (Zeeberg, 2012). This appears to be a manifestation of an evolutionary strategy for placement of genes in regions of the genome with a GC content that relates synonymous SCUB and protein folding. Remarkably, collections of Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COGs) for Archaea have described evolutionary reconstructions to reveal general trends in the evolution of Archaea and performed maximum likelihood reconstruction of the genome content of archaeal ancestral forms and gene gain and loss events in archaeal evolution (Wolf et al., 2012). This reconstruction showed that the last common ancestor of the extant Archaea was an organism of greater complexity than most of the extant archaea, probably with over 2500 protein-coding genes. The subsequent evolution of almost all archaeal lineages was apparently dominated by gene loss resulting in genome streamlining. Overall, gene losses are estimated to outnumber gene gains at least 4 to 1 in the evolution of Archaea. Analysis of specific patterns of gene gain in Archaea shows that gene exchange between major groups of Archaea appears to be largely random while the conserved core of archaeal genes appears to be stabilizing. Similarly, SCUB in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases indicated that GC-rich codons are mainly in charge of forming contracted conformation, especially the first nucleotide of codons plays a dominant role in translating the genomic GC signature into protein sequences and structures (Yang et al., 2010). Our previous research has revealed that conformation biases of amino acids are present in natural proteins and the corresponding biases of codons show an evident tendency in protein folding (Yang et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Eventually, viruses with well characterized hosts should experience translational selection to match the SCUB of their hosts, as this should allow for faster translation of highly expressed viral genes, and consequently more rapid viral replication (Cardinale et al., 2013). However, surveys examining viral SCUB have indicated that not all viruses are equally able to match their hosts\u05f3 codon preferences, and that this may be correlated with viral genomic architecture (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003). For instance, dsDNA coliphages were significantly better matched to Escherichia coli\u05f3s SCUB than ssDNA coliphages, because ssDNA phages had a preference for NNT codons, regardless of the hosts\u05f3 preferred codon usage (Cardinale and Duffy, 2011). Plant virus only infect monocots host but also infect eudicot hosts, such as the arthropod-vectored plant viruses, namely the positive sense ssRNA genus Potyvirus and family Luteoviridae, and the ssDNA family Geminiviridae (Cardinale et al., 2013). Monocots usually tend to have GC biased genes (53\u201356%), while eudicot genes generally have lower GC content (40\u201345%) (Wang and Roossinck, 2006). Monocots exclusively prefer G- and C-ending codons, while eudicots prefer a combination of G- and T-ending codons in their most highly expressed genes (Cardinale et al., 2013). These divergent hosts allow the strength of translational selection pressures to be compared among related viruses. All potyviruses had somewhat similar codon preferences, independent of host: monocot- and eudicot-infecting potyviruses both generally preferred A- and T-ending codons, while Luteoviruses, both monocot- and eudicot-infecting, tended to favor NNC codons (Cardinale et al., 2013). ssDNA dicot-infecting begomovirus CP genes exhibited a strong preference for NNT codons, while its Rep sequences strongly favored NNA codons. Begomovirus genomes are ambisense; genes are encoded in the coding and complimentary sense (Gutierrez, 1999). The coding sequence of the Rep gene is complimented on the virion strand. As a consequence, third positions in Rep gene are present as the first base of anti-codons in the single-stranded viral genome. Therefore, these findings indicate begomovirus genomes are enriched for thymine at synonymous sites in both the CP ORF (with T-ending codons) and Rep ORF (with T-beginning anticodons) (Cardinale et al., 2013). So, the codon preferences of ssRNA (luteoviruses and potyviruses) and ssDNA (geminiviruses) plant viruses could not directly relate with genomic base composition and translational selection, but constraints such as genomic architecture and secondary structure can and do influence codon usage in plant viruses. Additionally, our results indicate SIRV1 and SIRV2 preferred U- and A-ended codons which is not similar to their host Sulfolobus islandicus with low AT % (Nayak, 2013), which could be due to cytosine deamination to uracil, similar to eukaryotic ssDNA viruses. Similarly, ARV1 and AFV1 infecting Acidianus genus preferred A- and U-ended codons, which could be because of C to T transitions only at synonymous sites resulting in an overabundance of thymine in the genomic sequences and a corresponding preference for adenine in the coding sequence of ARV1 and AFV1. Here, mutational pressure may influence codon bias in SIRV1, SIRV2, ARV1 and AFV1 viruses. Particularly, PhiCh1 and HRPV1 infecting the kingdom Euryarchaeota are different from each other, except common 9 amino acids as follows: 6 two- and three-fold degenerate amino acids preferring C-ended codons, such as Phe, Tyr, His, Asp, Asn, and Ile, as well as six-fold amino acid Leu (CUC), and 2 two-fold amino acids preferring G-ended codons, such as Gln and Glu. 5 four-fold degenerate amino acids (i.e. Val, Gly, Pro, Thr, and Ala) prefer U-ended codons in HRPV1, but prefer G- or C-ended codons in PhiCh1. The conclusion that ssDNA is prone to rapid cytosine deamination to uracil (Frederico et al., 1990) could explain the preference for U-ending codons in ssDNA HRPV1, which supported the result of Wald et al. based on a large-scale analysis to assess SCUB pattern of pyrimidine-ending codons in highly expressed genes in prokaryotes (Wald et al., 2012). This is owing to the fact that the striking absence of tRNAs containing A at the wobble position (Marck and Grosjean, 2002) result in translation of synonymous codons ending with a pyrimidine residue (U or C) by a single tRNA containing G at the wobble position (Wald et al., 2012). We report that translational selection plays a leading role in HRPV1\u05f3s SCUB and HRPV1 can be more close to the prokaryotes in some properties.",
