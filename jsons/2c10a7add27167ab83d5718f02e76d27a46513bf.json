In addition to the clinical challenges associated with treating a large volume of severely unwell patients, HCWs working with this group of infectious patients face threats to their own physical health 1 , with a number of highly publicised HCW deaths already reported due to COVID-19. There is increasing recognition of the significant psychological impact of caring for those with COVID-19 given the immense pressure facing HCWs. For example, HCWs may face situations where they are at risk of sustaining moral injury 2 , while there are also difficulties in obtaining sufficient personal protective equipment. 3 Health systems are subsequently implementing mental health provision systems and additional psychological support 4 . In order to better plan and develop these support systems, and to assist with education around reactions to working with COVID-19 patients, a rapid systematic review was undertaken to determine the prevalence of mental health disorders in HCWs working with patients infected through a pandemic. We broadened our search to include studies relevant to the current COVID-19 crisis, e.g. pertaining to other coronavirus outbreaks (SARS, MERS) and other epidemics that represent significant risks to HCWs (e.g. Ebola). In particular we sought to establish the prevalence of different conditions at different phases, i.e. during and immediately after a pandemic, then over the following months.",

However, it is likely that the COVID may have a longer, ongoing acute phase than in those studies reviewed such staff may have longer exposure to stress whilst experiencing PTSS. Furthermore, it is possible that COVID-19 represents a degree of threat more serious than that from previous pandemics due to factors including lack of personal protective equipment and impaired systemic resilience factors related to social distancing.
