A variety of antibodies encoded in the form of a phagemid library can be displayed on the surface of phages, providing genotype-to-phenotype linkage and making them useful for antibody selection and identification [9,10]. The biopanning process selectively enriches a set of antibodies with affinity to a given antigen so that a series of binders can be selected out of a large number of non-binding clones. This tremendous screening capability, along with several previously reported advantages [11,12,13], has made phage display the gold standard for antibody drug discovery.",

            "text": "Despite these benefits, phage display technology has intrinsic technical limitations. Laborious colony picking and the functional testing of individual phage clones restrict the practical screening size to the thousands, which is a fraction of the required level [14]. Even with the help of automated instruments such as colony pickers [15,16,17], the gap between practical and ideal screening capacities cannot be bridged. This necessitates multiple rounds of biopanning, which typically takes weeks. Loss of the best binders is also a critical problem inherent in phage display. Rare binders can be lost due to the strong amplification bias introduced during successive biopanning processes [18,19]. Furthermore, insufficient elution can cause the loss of strong binders, excluding them from the subsequent steps [20]. The development of an elaborate approach addressing these technical issues is required to minimize labor-intensive work, save considerable time, and reduce the possibility of losing the best binders in the process.",

For phage display applications, various single-cell-level analyses were developed to minimize amplification bias and maximize throughput, thereby reducing the number of biopanning rounds. By employing a microcapillary device with densely packed microreaction chambers, more than one million antibody clones were successfully screened at once [24]. A microfluidic device was also utilized to generate water-in-oil microemulsion reaction chambers, theoretically increasing the analysis throughput to infinite [25,26]. Although both methods could reduce the number of required biopanning rounds based on their extremely high throughput, they require complicated sample isolation approaches. Furthermore, both methods are vulnerable to possible sample cross-contamination during sample retrieval [27,28,29].",

The cured 3-mm-thick PDMS block, with a two-dimensional array of cylindrical microwells (d ~ 60 \u00b5m, h ~ 40 \u00b5m), was then peeled off from the mold. The sample-capturing substrate was prepared by forming a sample-capturing layer on top of an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass slide (ITO thickness ~100 nm, Fine Chemicals, Seoul, Korea). For the sample-capturing layer formation, a mixture of 3.4 mL of (7.0\u20138.0% vinylmethylsiloxane)\u2013dimethylsiloxane copolymer (VDT-731); 18 \u00b5L of platinum\u2013divinyltetramethyldisiloxane (SIP6831.2LC); 1 mL of (25\u201335% methylhydrosiloxane)\u2013dimethylsiloxane copolymer (HMS-301); and 100 \u00b5L of 1,3,5,7-tetravinyl\u20131,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (SIT7900.0, all from Gelest, Morrisville, PA, USA) was spin-coated and thermally cured [32,33,34], yielding a polymeric layer with a thickness of 7 \u00b5m. The microwell array and sample-capturing substrate were directed towards each other and fixed using a custom-made chip holder consisting of an aluminum plate and acryl sheet. The chip holder was designed to fit into a conventional microplate reader for optical imaging through a transparent window, while maintaining reliable compartmentalization of individual microreaction chambers with tightening screws.",

To achieve this, individual E. coli cells carrying phagemid clones were separated from each other in an independent microwell environment. Then, E. coli cells were allowed to grow, while phages displaying scFvs encoded by the phagemid DNA were rescued. The rescued phages interacted with the antigen-coated surface of the microreaction chamber (Figure 1A). A parallel reaction performed in an array of identical microwells enabled library screening at single-cell resolution in a nearly identical environment. The microwell array chip was disassembled into two components (Figure 1B, microwell array and sample-capturing substrate), which were subjected to different experiments. The microwell array was used for phage fluorescence microwell immunoassays. The microwell array was first washed and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-M13 antibody. Then, fluorescence images of the microwell array chip were acquired in order to obtain the locations of the AR phage clones (Figure 1E(ii)). Next, the AR phage clones were retrieved from the three-layer sample-capturing substrate. The sample-capturing layer was prepared to reliably capture the phages by spin-coating a mixture of vinylmethylsiloxane\u2013dimethylsiloxane copolymer; platinum\u2013divinyltetramethyldisiloxane; methylhydrosiloxane\u2013dimethylsiloxane copolymer; and 1,3,5,7-tetravinyl\u20131,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane and thermal curing.",

A subset of phage clones (15.5%) contained noisy base callings in sequencing and were excluded from further analysis. Microwells with multi-cell seeding events, which occurred in ~5% of the non-empty microwells at a cell loading concentration of 0.1 cell/well, contained mixed samples and partially accounted for the noisy base calling. The sequences of AR P1, P2, and P3 phage clones were obtained at a ~3:1:2 ratio, while the NR clone sequence was not detected (Figure 3D). The fluorescence intensity of the AR P1 phage clone was generally higher than those of P2 and P3, possibly reflecting a higher relative retrieval frequency of P1.

            "text": "In this work, a mutagenesis library with random mutations at five amino acid residues in the heavy-chain variable region was synthesized for deimmunization and subjected to our platform without a preconditioning biopanning process (Figure 4A). Using seven microwell array chips, more than 70,000 phage clones were screened, corresponding to ~14% of the library diversity. In phage fluorescence microwell immunoassays, 318 microwells (AR hit ratio ~0.45%) exhibited distinct fluorescence signals, all of which were subjected to sequencing analysis. After excluding sequences with defective variable chains, codon frameshifts, or low-quality scores, we successfully identified 228 unique scFv clones (total read count ~2963). The read counts of the most frequent clone and the second most frequent clone were 1823 and 584, respectively, accounting for 81.2% of the total read count. The recovered scFv clones with unintended mutations or amino acid mismatches, compared to the wild-type clone, were further filtered out, leaving 99 clones. The antigen reactivity of clones was measured using phage ELISA. When the absorbance of the tested clones exceeded the mean plus five standard deviations of that of negative control wells (absorbance \u2265 0.4), we designated the clone as an AR clone. As a result, 78 out of 99 clones (78.8%) were finally confirmed as AR clones with the mutation frequency pattern shown in Figure 4A. The other clones were regarded as false-positive clones, generated by nonspecific binding of the overexpressed low-affinity clones to the antigens within the microwells. When the filtering condition was extended to allow up to two amino acid mismatches on unintended amino acid residues, the number of discovered AR clones increased to 148 (Figure 4B,C). Those mismatches could have originated from undesired mutational events introduced by PCR, possibly having no effect on their affinities and thereby increasing the final number of identified AR clones. Among the additional 70 AR clones obtained, 47 were indeed found to have exactly the same mutation pattern, with one of those perfectly matched to the wild-type clone.",
