The ICTRP COVID-19 trial list had grown to 586 by 31 March 2020 [2]. Most are based in China, but the COVID-19 pandemic is now global, and trials are moving with it. Governments and the public are clamouring for safe and effective treatments. Without rigorous, prospective, randomised trials, we risk exposing many people to treatments that might not work. Now more than ever, we need trialists to predefine and publicly post their designs and analyses.",
