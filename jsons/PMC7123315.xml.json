            "text": "An interesting constituent of epidemiology is the detective work to track down the origins of novel viruses. An example of such investigative work is the exploration into the origin of Nipah virus, a paramyxovirus, which caused an epidemic illness in Malaysia in 1998. A mild disease occurred among pigs that eventually spread as a severe, fatal disease to man and dogs. The first outbreak was noted in 1998 in the village of Ampang, where there were a number of cases of fatal encephalitis among farmers, and respiratory infections and encephalitis among pigs. The disease spread to other parts of Malaysia with the movement of pigs for commercial reasons. The outbreak was arrested by a mass cull, which began on March 20, 1999 and ended on April 26 of that year, with a ban on the movement of pigs [1, 2]. Malaysia had 2.4 million pigs and 1,800 pig farms in January 1999; by July 21, 1.1 million pigs and 956 farms had been destroyed and 48 more pig farms had closed. In 1998 and 1999, there was a total of 265 confirmed human cases of Nipah virus and 105 human deaths. Infection with Nipah virus was associated with encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), characterized by fever, drowsiness, and more serious central nervous system symptoms, such as coma, seizures, and inability to breathe. The virus also spread to cats, dogs, and even to ponies. There have been no further outbreaks in Malaysia since then.",

The affected area of Malaysia had been cleared of jungle and planted with fruit trees. These fruit trees were attractive to a particular species of bats known as \u201cflying foxes (Fig. 20.1)\u201d. They in turn sprinkled the areas with their droppings into areas foraged by pigs; the droppings contained the virus, which was infectious to pigs and other mammals. Although the bats contained viral antigens and antibodies, they were healthy. Thus there was a chain of events, triggered by land clearing, that resulted in a novel virus infection. In fact, it has been hypothesized that the clearing of virgin forests, as is being done in the Amazon, may also result in new infections in man as wildlife attempts to find new habitats.\n",

            "text": "\nEbola outbreaks occur with ferocity and suddenness, and with high mortality; they may originate from bats, and the virus spreads easily to a susceptible human population. Ebola is the most lethal human viral infection known, First identified in 1976 in Zaire and the Sudan, it causes hemorrhagic fever (internal bleeding) with a mortality rate of 88 %. The first recorded outbreak killed 280 out of 318 cases in Zaire, and 151 out of 284 cases in the Sudan. The disease spread very rapidly among hospital personnel treating the sick, and among the general population through contact with ill persons, handling the dead, and reuse of needles. Because there is a danger of infection in preparing the dead for burial, there arose the practice of burning the bodies and the huts where the victims had lived; therefore, strict precautions are necessary for handling Ebola infections. A subtype of Ebola, known as Ebola Reston, occurred among monkeys imported from the Philippines in the state of Virginia and later in Texas, in 1990 and 1992. Luckily this strain was non-pathogenic for humans although some handlers did develop antibodies to the virus [5, 6]. During the 1990s there were fatal outbreaks of Ebola in the Congo; in one case, 16 people became sick from eating a chimpanzee found dead in the jungle. Other cases have involved an index case among hunters and among people associated with hunting primates. Sizeable outbreaks occurred in Uganda in 2000\u20132001, with 425 cases and a mortality rate of 53 %. Table 20.1 lists the major outbreaks since 1976 (source: CDC Ebola resources) (Fig. 20.3 illustrates the ecology as known, of the virus and Fig. 20.4 illustrates the unusual structure of the virus).\n\n\n\n",

The Chinese authorities reported the outbreak to the WHO, with 305 cases (including 105 health care workers) and five deaths. This may have been an underestimate of the severity of the outbreak [9]. The first clue of the outbreak appears to be on November 27, 2002, when Canada\u2019s Global Public Health International Network (GPHIN), an electronic warning system that is part of the World Health Organization\u2019s Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network (GOARN), picked up reports of a \u201cflu outbreak\u201d in China through Internet media monitoring and analysis, and the data was forwarded to the WHO. Most news media in China did not report the extent of the outbreak, in keeping with the government\u2019s policy of not reporting bad news. This hindered the treatment and the recognition that this was a major new epidemic illness. The illness spread extremely quickly, primarily among health care workers and physicians attending to the sick. What is rather amazing is the speed with which the virus was sequenced, recognized, and brought under control by quarantine and international cooperation. Scientists are still puzzled as to how 64-year-old Dr. Liu Jianlun could have transferred\u2014during his brief stay\u2014the virus to 16 other occupants of the same floor of his hotel. These guests subsequently travelled to other destinations, including Toronto, Vietnam, and Singapore, thus spreading the virus. In less than 4 months, some 4,000 cases and 550 deaths from SARS outside of China can be traced to this one visit to the Metropol Hotel. (The hotel is considering turning the 9th floor, where Dr. Jianlun stayed, into a museum.) [10].",

Further analysis of civets in the wild did not find traces of the virus. Thus the civets in the market must have also been \u201cdead-end\u201d victims of SARS. In 2005 two teams of researchers reported the presence of similar corona viruses in Chinese horseshoe bats. These are probably the culprits, and the virus was probably passed on through an intermediate host in the market. Using DNA sequencing techniques (although this is an RNA virus), scientists have been able to work out the relationship between the virus discovered in humans, bats, and civets [11, 12].",

Based on this evidence, biologists have come up with a plausible path of transmission: infected bats and uninfected civets came into contact at a market, the virus was transmitted to civets and then multiplied and evolved in civets (or other animals) in the public market, until eventually the virus hopped over to humans. It is apparent that many of the \u201cemerging\u201d viruses can be linked back to bats (including Nipah and possibly Ebola viruses).",

An unexplained pulmonary (lung) illness occurred in an area shared by Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah. Quite a number of previously healthy young adults died from an acute respiratory infection; the outbreak was related to an increase in crop yield with a concomitant increase in the deer mouse population. The virus was isolated from a deer mouse captured close to the home of one of the victims, and identified as a new virus, first called \u201cMuerto Canyon virus,\u201d but later changed to \u201cSin Nombre virus\u201d (SNV). Why did this outbreak occur in 1993? Previous years had seen periods of drought, and not enough food to maintain a large deer mouse population. In 1993 there was plenty of rain and snow, and thus the plant yield was greater than usual. It is estimated that the deer mouse population grew tenfold during this period, and thus had more contact with humans [16]. Since the initial outbreak of Hantavirus, other strains of the virus have been identified that have not been associated with the Four Corners states [17]. This is probably not a new virus; the Navajo Indians of the region appeared to be familiar with a respiratory infection that was associated with increases in the mouse population.

These include the arena viruses, a large class of viruses that include Lassa fever, and other hemorrhagic fever viruses named for their countries of origin, such as Bolivian, Venezuelan, and Brazilian hemorrhagic fevers; these viruses are associated with rats and mice (Fig. 20.9). They do not cause obvious illness in the rodent population and the virus is shed in the urine or droppings of the rodents. The virus can be inhaled as an aerosol, or in some cases transferred by person-to-person contact, as discussed above for Ebola. Lassa virus was first identified in 1969 when two missionary nurses died in Nigeria, West Africa. The virus causes significant morbidity and mortality. It is endemic in western Africa and the estimates are of between 100,000 and 300,000 infections per year. The mortality rate varies between 5\u201325 %, depending on the outbreak. Many more may be infected without symptoms. The reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the \u201cmultimammate rat\u201d of the genus Mastomys. This is a small rat that lives among humans in large areas of West, Central and East Africa. The virus is spread in the droppings and urine of the rats, and may be picked up in dust. The rats are often consumed as food, and if infected, transmission to humans may occur during handling. Human-to-human transmission may also occur through body fluids and sexual transmission, since the virus can be found in semen. Eradicating the rats, storing food in rodent-proof containers, trapping and removing the animals and avoiding them for food, can control the virus. However, the population of rats is so great that annihilation of the population is very difficult.",
