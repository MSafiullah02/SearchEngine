The latter include, but are not limited to, glycolipids, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans. Unlike proteins, which are composed of amino acids that are connected solely by one possible peptide bond, carbohydrates utilize many possible glycosidic linkages so as to extensively diversify their structures. For example, two amino acid residues, such as two alanines, can produce only one possible dipeptide; however, two molecules of glucose have the potential to generate 11 different disaccharides. A trimer of any of the nine common sugar residues of the human body theoretically can give rise to 119,736 different structural isomers; this is in striking contrast to the maximal construction of 8,000 tripeptides using 20 different amino acid residues. Theoretically, sugar chain structures can have unlimited variation.",

In plants, a highly complex set of polysaccharides are associated with structural proteins and lignin to form cell walls (Avci et al. 2012 ). Even in a given tissue or cell, cell wall layers and domains may have very different carbohydrate structures and express different glyco-epitopes (Albersheim et al. 2010; Avci et al. 2012) . Many microbial organisms also carry unique glycosylation systems and produce specific sugar signatures for almost every microorganism in the living world (Dochez and Avery 1917; Heidelberger and Avery 1923; Ezzell et al. 1990; Robbins and Schneerson 1990; Mond et al. 1995; Wang and Kabat 1996) .

For example, there are numerous anti-glycan antibodies produced by human and other animal species that play key roles in protecting a host from microbial infections (Behring and Kitasato 1890; Wang and Kabat 1998; Lucas et al. 2008 ) and families of lectin-like glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) that are evolved for carbohydrate-mediated cell-cell communication (Drickamer 1988; Sharon 2007; Varki 2009 ). The well-known GBPs that are associated with cell signaling and immunomodulation are the receptors of the innate immune system, such as Dectin-1 that recognizes fungal \u03b2-glucans (Brown et al. 2002) , mannose receptor that recognizes carbohydrate moieties on multiple pathogens and is involved in the clearance of inflammatory molecules in vivo (Gruden-Movsesijan and Milosavljevic Lj 2006) , and DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin) that selectively detects viral glycoproteins, such as HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein (Curtis et al. 1992) . The interaction between HIV-1 gp120 and DC-SIGN plays an important role in the CD4-independent association of HIV with human cells (Curtis et al. 1992) .

The latter includes polysaccharides and various glycoconjugates. These different sugar chips or arrays were developed to accommodate multipurpose applications in carbohydrate research. For example, mono-and disaccharide microarrays are suitable for screening and characterizing novel carbohydrate-binding proteins or carbohydrate-catalyzing enzymes and for identifying novel inhibitors of carbohydrate-protein interactions. A large class of carbohydrate-binding proteins, called lectins, was initially classified by their binding specificities to monosaccharides and recently by disaccharides. However, there are lectins and many antibodies with anti-carbohydrate reactivities that bind to larger and more complex carbohydrate ligands or antigenic determinants. Mono-and disaccharide sugar chips are not sufficient for investigations involving such molecular targets. Oligosaccharide, polysaccharide, and glycoconjugate microarrays fill this gap by displaying carbohydrates of complex structures or longer sugar chains on the chips.",

These include technologies that directly utilize underivatized carbohydrates in microarray construction, technologies that require chemical modification of carbohydrates before microarray fabrication, methods of non-covalent immobilization of carbohydrates, and methods of covalent coupling of saccharides on array substrates. The use of underivatized saccharides for microarray construction has the advantage of preserving the native structures of the carbohydrate molecules. It requires, however, a ready-to-use microarray surface with appropriate surface chemistry that can be directly used to fabricate comprehensive carbohydrate microarrays with underivatized carbohydrates from a wide range of sources. Methods currently in use include non-covalent binding of underivatized carbohydrate antigens by passive adsorption on a chip, such as nitrocellulose-coated glass slides (Wang et al. 2002) or black polystyrene surfaces (Willats et al. 2002) , and methods for covalently immobilizing underivatized carbohydrates on a slide surface by appropriate chemical linking techniques (Angeloni et al. 2005; Lee and Shin 2005; Carroll et al. 2006; Zhou and Zhou 2006; Wang et al. 2007; Zhou et al. 2009 Zhou et al. , 2012 .",

For instance, they contain the capacity to display a large panel of carbohydrates in a limited chip space, they are highthroughput quantitative assays, they make an effective use of carbohydrate substances that are often difficult or cost-inefficient to synthesize, and, as discussed below, they are highly sensitive in monitoring carbohydrate-anti-carbohydrate interactions in multiplex manners. In a carbohydrate microarray, each carbohydrate is spotted in an amount that is drastically smaller than that required for a conventional molecular or immunological assay. This technical feature ensures a condition in which the binding of a molecule in solution phase to an immobilized microspot of ligand on the microarray substrate has minimal reduction of the molar concentration of the molecule in solution (Ekins et al. 1990 ). Thus, microarray-based assays are intrinsically optimized for binding equilibrium to take place, which is the basis for this class of hypersensitive binding assays (Stoll et al. 2002) . Carbohydrate microarrays have higher detection sensitivity than most conventional carbohydrate analytical tools, such as carbohydrate-specific ELISA and the glycolipid-based \"Eastern blot\" assays that were developed in the 1980s by a number of early researchers in this field (Wood and Kabat 1981; Tang et al. 1985) . Historically, this situation is very similar to the relationship between conventional blotting methods for nucleic acids or proteins, such as Southern, Northern, and Western blots, and nucleic acid-based or protein/peptide-based microarrays.",

            "text": "Carbohydrate microarrays constructed by various methods may differ in their technical characteristics and suitability for a given practical application. Some platforms may be applied complementarily to solve a practical question. For example, the method of nitrocellulose-based immobilization of carbohydratecontaining macromolecules, including polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids, is suitable for the high-throughput construction of carbohydrate antigen microarrays (Wang et al. 2002 Wang and Lu 2004) to support the largescale immunological characterization of carbohydrate antigens and anticarbohydrate antibodies. However, the detection specificity of this carbohydrate microarray would be at the level of a carbohydrate antigen, not a glyco-epitope, if the native carbohydrate antigens were spotted. This is owing to the fact that many carbohydrate antigens display multiple antigenic determinants or glyco-epitopes (Cisar et al. 1975; Wang and Kabat 1998; Wang 2004) . Examining the finer details of the binding properties would require the use of microarrays of defined oligosaccharide sequences. Oligosaccharide array-based binding assays can be applied, in combination with saccharide competition assays, to decipher precise saccharide components of a specific antigenic determinant or glyco-epitope (Fukui et al. 2002; Blixt et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2007; Zhou et al. 2009 ). These technical features of carbohydrate microarrays are further discussed in two models, i.e., a carbohydrate antigen microarray platform and a technology of photogenerated oligosaccharide microarrays in subsequent sections.",

Customized, smaller scale carbohydrate microarrays containing a few dozen antigens are, however, suitable for more defined purposes, such as antibody fine-specificity mapping, differential diagnosis among a number of known infectious diseases, measurement of autoantibodies for known targets in autoimmune diseases, etc. Fig. 2 shows a sub-array design where each chemically modified microglass slide contains eight separated sub-arrays. The microarray capacity is~400 microspots per sub-array. A single slide is, thus, designed to enable eight microarray assays. Similar sub-array designs with various array capacities are commercially available (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH; ArrayIt, Sunnyvale, CA).",

A single slide is, therefore, designed to enable 12 detections. This design is typically for printing four 96-well plates of antigen preparations (96 \u00c2 4 = 384). \u2022 Repeats and dilutions: Our team usually prints carbohydrate antigens at the initial concentration of 0.1-0.5 \u03bcg/\u03bcl. The absolute amount of antigens printed on the chip substrate is in the range of 0.1-0.25 ng per microspot for the highest concentration. They are further diluted at 1:3, 1:9, and 1:27, or as specified in each experiment. A given concentration of each preparation is repeated at least three times to allow statistical analysis of detection of identical preparations at given antigen concentrations. \u2022 Positive controls and standard curves: Fluorescent conjugates, such as BSA conjugates of FITC, Cy5, Cy3, or other dyes, are routinely applied for microarray printing to provide positive markers for each fluorescent channel. These markers are helpful for scanning calibration, alignment of microarray spots during data-capturing, the subsequent microarray data normalization, and cross-chip scaling of microarray detection. For serological studies, antibodies of IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes of corresponding species are spotted to produce standard curves in microarray format. These curves serve as reference standards for quantifying antibody signals of a specific IgH chain isotype that are captured by spotted carbohydrate antigens.",

Given the structural diversity of carbohydrate antigens, examining each antigen preparation to determine the efficacy of its immobilization in a given type of substrate and the surface display of the desired glyco-epitopes in a microarray assay is essential. A practical approach is to incubate the printed microarrays with antibodies, receptors, or lectins known to react with the printed substance. Figure 3 is an example of such analysis where lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) and antibody 2G12 were applied to examine specific glyco-epitopes on the spotted microarrays. Inspection of both microarray images (Fig. 3a ) and the quantitative datasets show that the GNA-epitopes were presented by three glycoconjugates (Fig. 3c) , i.e., Man9-cluster (4 # ), M9_2G12-cluster (3 # ), and Man5-9 RB (1 # ). In contrast, 2G12-glyco-epitopes were preserved only by one of the three, i.e., M9_2G12-cluster (3 # ), on this microarray substrate (Fig. 3d) . This carbohydrate microarray analysis demonstrates, therefore, an example that the same sugar chain may generate different glyco-epitopes when the sugar moiety is presented in different cluster configurations. In this case, the Man9GlcNAc2Asn moiety was coupled to the protein carriers in either (Man9GlcNAc2Asn) n-or [(Man9GlcNAc2Asn) 4 ] n-configurations (Fig. 3b) . The latter but not the former preserves well the 2G12-defined broadly HIV-1 neutralizing epitope.",

Upon exposure to UV radiation, the phthalimide end-groups graft to surface-adsorbed carbohydrates to form a covalent bond. The amount of surface-grafted carbohydrate is enhanced when carbohydrate surface interactions are increased by the incorporation of amine-terminated molecules into the monolayer.

The rationale was that if B. anthracis spores expressed immunogenic carbohydrate structures, the spore antigen-immunized or B. anthracis-infected animals would be possible to mount antibody responses to these carbohydrates. This assumption was made on the basis of the fact that the host immune system is able to recognize subtle changes in sugar structures, especially those that are exposed on the surfaces of microbial pathogens that are foreign components of the mammalian hosts. Figure 5 below is an example of photo-chip characterization of the rabbit antisera elicited by B. anthracis spores.

However, it causes difficulty in identifying the disease-specific autoantigens and autoantibodies. In our microarray analyses, we reconfirmed this observation. Figure 6a , b show the overlay plots of antibody profiles of the two groups. The colored needles that link the pairs of group mean values provide a global comparison of the antibody profiles between the MS group (red circles) and the OND group (blue crosses). This comparison reveals global differences in antibody profiles between the two groups. Specifically, the microarray scores of CSF-antibody activities in the MS group are generally higher than those seen in the CSF of OND subjects. These include not only anti-lipid antibodies (Right, 26-44 # ), as previously reported (Ho et al. 2012 ), but also anti-carbohydrate antibodies (Left, 1-22 # ).",

CSF samples from 11 MS (10 RRMS and 1 SPMS) and 9 OND subjects were characterized using microarrays spotted with 12 lipid and 20 carbohydrate antigens. Each preparation was spotted in triplicate at 2-4 dilutions. As illustrated in the overlay plots (a-d), this microarray supports detection of 126 unique antibody signatures. These included 63 IgG (a, c) and 63 IgM (b, d) signatures. Anti-human IgG or IgM secondary antibodies were used to reveal the antigen-specific antibodies detected by these microarrays. The captured IgG were stained with an anti-human IgG antibody conjugated with Cy3 at 2 \u03bcg/ml and the captured IgM in the same array revealed by a biotinylated anti-human IgM secondary antibody at 2 \u03bcg/ml and developed with Streptavidin-Cy5 conjugate at 2 \u03bcg/ml. Microarray datasets in (a) and (b) were illustrated as microarray scores. In (c) and (d) microarray datasets were further processed using JMP Genomics to produce RAR* scores. The results are presented as overlay plots of the mean microarray scores for each group. The colored needles that link the group mean values of each pair of scores provide a global comparison of the antibody profiles of MS (red circles) and OND (blue crosses) groups (Adapted from Wang et al. (2014) ). *RAR Score: RAR Relative Antibody Reactivity, the value of log2 transformed and IQR-standardized microarray value (meanbackground). For each antigen in a given concentration, the mean value of triplicate array detections was calculated differentiators between MS and OND. These were M9_2G12_IgG and Man9_IgG. Results of the one-way ANOVA of the two Man9 clusters are shown in Fig. 7b . All other antibody signatures had -log10 p-values below the cutoff line (Fig. 7a) , including four signatures that were variably higher in the MS group than in the OND group. These were N279_IgG (P = 0.0825), B1299S_IgG (P = 0.0886), B1355S_IgG (P = 0.1135), and Bacto_Agar_IgG (P = 0.021). This microarray analysis identified, therefore, oligomannoses as potential immunological targets In the volcano plot, each point represents a biologically unique feature captured by the microarray, i.e., a normalized difference for a specific antibody signature (RAR MS -RAR OND ). The x-axis is the normalized difference (log2 scale); the y-axis is the -log10 ( p-value), which weights the levels of significance of a difference. Points above the red-dashed line (cutoff level 2) represent signatures that differ significantly between the groups based on the Bonferroni test. Two signatures, M9_2G12_IgG and Man9_IgG, were identified by this critical statistical test as highly significant markers. In (b) and (c) one-way analysis was performed to compare group means among the selected carbohydrate antigens listed in each panel. Each point in the panels represents the mean value (RAR score) of triplicate array detections of a subject (Adapted from Wang et al. (2014)) for further investigation. Overall, JMP Genomics is a valuable tool for statistical analysis of carbohydrate microarray data.",

These technologies are especially useful in exploring the repertoire of glyco-epitomes. A number of carbohydrate microarray platforms have now reached or are very close to the technical stage of the current nucleic acid-based or protein-based microarrays that are readily available for practical uses. Technical issues that require further improvement may include, but are not limited to, optimization of existing technologies for array construction, quality control and technical standardization in both microarray production and application, and establishment of specialized bioinformatics tools to handle the massive amount of carbohydrate microarray data and to effectively extract diagnostic or research information from each microarray assay. Nevertheless, exploring the repertoires of glyco-epitopes represents a long-term goal of glycomics research. It was estimated that the human glycome contains 10,000-20,000 minimal epitopes for glycan-binding proteins (Cummings 2009 ). In considering the repertoires of the \"hybrid\" structures that are generated by protein posttranslational modification, including both Nand O-glycosylation, the repertoires of carbohydrate-related antigenic structures can be much larger. Furthermore, the conformational diversity of carbohydrates and microheterogeneity of carbohydrate chains substantially increases the repertoire of carbohydrate-based antigenic determinants or glyco-epitopes (Wang and Kabat 1996; Wang 2014) . Including carbohydrate structures of the microbial world, which are directly relevant to medicine, the sizes and diversity of the repertoires of glyco-epitopes are unpredictable.",

The former was revealed by Alexa 647 -tagged Goat anti-human IgG Fc-specific antibodies at 2 \u03bcg/ml and then developed with Streptavidin-Cy5 conjugate at 2 \u03bcg/ml. (a) Shows microarray images stained with either GNA or 2G12. (b) Illustrates the cluster configuration of the three Man9-conjugates. Microarray detection signals are shown as the mean fluorescent intensities (MFIs) of each microspot as captured by the ScanArray 5000A for the arrays stained with GNA (c) and 2G12 (d), respectively. Results were compared using overlay plots of the MFIs of staining signal (red circles) versus those of local backgrounds surrounding the antigen microarrays (blue +) (c, d) (Adapted fromWang et al. (2014)) with two 20 mL portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform extract was washed with several 20 mL portions of H 2 O. The chloroform was removed by rotoevaporation, and residual DMF was removed on a high vacuum line to give a pale yellow liquid (0.99 g, 72 % yield). The compound was used without further purification. Note that, for self-assembly experiments, residual DMF was not removed. 1H NMR: (CDCl3) \u20aca 7.82 (m, 2H), 7.69 (m, 2H), 3.66 (t, J 7 Hz, 2H), 3.55 (s, 9H), 1.44-1.15 (m, 18H), 0.71-0.51 (m, 2H).
