            "text": "At present, the demand of natural rubber glove (NRG) exponentially increases due to the health awareness. After its use, NRG is generally left as garbage which is difficult to biodegrade since polyisoprene chains of NR are crosslinked either by sulphur (Riyajan et al., 2003, Hall et al., 2009) or peroxide system. The problem of NRG waste disposal is, therefore, growing as a direct result of rapid industrialization and population growth. Especially, the infectious waste from hospital and other toxic hazardous waste might cause serious environmental problem and great health risk to public. For example, the diseases like diarrhea, leptospirosis, typhoid and cholera can be transmitted through the mismanagement of waste. Moreover, the public increasingly concerns over the handling of medical waste because of the recent acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) dilemma, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, Avian influenza and those posed by other communicable diseases such as hepatitis B.",

The environment authority agency such as The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the landfilling or incineration (Johannessen et al., 2000) and pyrolysis process (Dong et al., 2001, Conrardy et al., 2010) to reduce the PS waste (Hall et al., 2009). The pyrolysis of the rubber waste by using Y-zeolite as catalyst gave mainly of limonene and oligomers of polyisoprene. The presence of the Y-zeolite catalyst in the pyrolysis of rubber caused an increase in the yield of hydrocarbon gases similar to the degradation of polystyrene (PS) (Berekaa et al., 2000). The destruction of NRG waste by molten salt oxidation produced CO2, N2 and water (Hsu et al., 2000). In this case, the chemical composition of the degraded glove, analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under N2, played a fundamental role in pyrolytic behavior.",

In addition, the rubber waste was blended with virgin synthetic rubber and NR to improve the polymer processing. However, the blend of NRG waste with polystyrene foam (PSF) waste was not found in literature. The reports concerned only about the use of PSF waste in polymeric flocculants (Wies\u0142aw et al., 2005), ion adsorption (Long et al., 2010), polymer mortar panels and electrolyte (Bhutta et al., 2011). The polymeric flocculant, i.e., poly(styrene sulphonate) acid, was obtained from PSF waste and virgin PS during the sulphonation process using H2SO4 as sulphonating agent and Ag2SO4 as catalyst. The effectiveness of the flocculation depended on the number of sulphonic groups per monomer unit and its molecular weight. In addition, PSF waste blended with poly(methyl methacrylate) and reinforced with steel fiber was applied in polymer mortar panels (PMPs) (Bhutta et al., 2011). Due to their high ductile and load-bearing capacity, PMPs could replace a commercial polymer-impregnated mortar panel in practical applications.",

As reported in the previous work concerning NR/butadiene (BR)/ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) blend, it was expected that the addition of MA would improve the properties of NRG/PSF blend (Zhang et al., 2010). The NRG waste was masticated by a two-roll mill and dispersed in toluene. The NRG dispersion was mixed with PSF and MA dissolved in toluene under continuous stirring. After drying at ambient temperature, the NRG/PSF blend was laminated with cellulose from sugar cane leaves by using a compression molding. Effects of polymer blend ratio, MA and cellulose contents on the properties, i.e., tensile strength, hardness and tear strength, of polymer composite were investigated. Their chemical structure and morphology were studied by using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (ATR-FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. Toluene resistance of the polymer composite was also determined.",

But when MA increased from 5 to 10 or 15% (w/w) (Fig. 5(c) and (d)), the strong adhesion bonding between the polymer matrix and the cellulose fiber appeared due to more occurrences in chemical reaction between polymer matrix and hydroxyl group from cellulose which may reduce the damage of fracture.

The results agreed well with those of NR filled cellulose previously reported (Bras, 2010). The drop in the tensile properties of the polymer composites when increasing NRG content was reasonably due to poor interaction between cellulose and the NRG/PSF matrix. Moreover, the poor dispersion and/or agglomeration of the filler in the matrix led to the in-homogeneity of phase morphology which became the dominant process in the mixing.

At 50/50 NRG/PSF, the impact strength values of the polymer composites with 0, 3, 5 and 12% cellulose were 7, 12, 21 and 23.5 J/m2, respectively. The reinforcement might be because a polymer chain could interact with several units of the fibers. If this chain breaks due to the impact energy, the load is transferred to many other chains providing the increase in impact strength of the material (Megiatto et al., 2010).",

Their mechanical properties were better than those of PSF due to the chemical reaction between PSF/cellulose and MA which were confirmed by gel content and ATR-FTIR. The highest tensile strength of sample was found in 30/70 NRG/PSF blended with 10% MA and 12% cellulose. This observation was supported by SEM, toluene resistance, impact strength and hardness. The polymer composite would potentially be used in artificial wood, artificial bone, pot and picture frame.",
