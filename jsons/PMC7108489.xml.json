Although we did not include controls or follow-up samples, seven symptoms were more common in patients with viral infections, regardless of whether they also had a bacterial infection, than in patients with a bacterial or no infection. Since neither the clinicians nor the patients were aware of the throat swab result at the time, it is unlikely bias accounted for these differences.",

Possible explanations include presentation of non-infective illnesses, such as cardiac conditions or malignancy (21), or false-negative results: although the Taqman\u00a9 assay is widely used and has high accuracy (37), it is estimated that the organisms responsible for between 12 and 39% of lower respiratory infections are still to be identified (38).",
