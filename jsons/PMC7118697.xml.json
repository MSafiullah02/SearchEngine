Minimizing fellow trainee contact with patients may include rotation of days involved in direct patient service, managing remote checks and conducting patient tele-health visits. Attempts should be similarly made to limit exposure of EP allied professionals, including nurses, device clinic personnel, hospital administrators, and medical device company representatives.

Improved understanding of this is critical, primarily in guiding the need for additional arrhythmia monitoring (e.g., mobile cardiac telemetry) post discharge and whether an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or wearable cardioverter defibrillator will be needed in those with impaired left ventricular function thought secondary to COVID-19.",

Due to the increased numbers of COVID-19 cases and the anticipated impact on health care resources (e.g., hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, PPE, and the blood supply), it is recommended, and increasingly mandated, to postpone or cancel non-urgent, elective procedures. The definition of what constitutes an elective/non-urgent case should be based on individualized risk assessment, informed by the patient\u2019s clinical status. In general, it is reasonable to consider deferring any test or procedure that is unlikely to directly impact clinical care or outcomes over the next several months.

Many patients with arrhythmias are among the sickest of those with cardiovascular disease. To protect patients (many of whom are high risk due to coexisting comorbidities) and healthcare teams from COVID-19 exposure, preserve resources and maintain access to necessary cardiovascular care, it is important that nonessential encounters, tests and procedures be postponed. While electrophysiology is uniquely suited to leverage virtual care and remote monitoring, it is important to assure patients that they have our full support, and we are ready and able to provide care as necessary.",
