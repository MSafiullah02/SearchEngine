            "text": "Sequence-specific methods for detecting polynucleotides are critical to the diagnosis of genetic and pathogenic diseases (Hacia et al. 1996). The study of molecular diagnostics based on the analysis of DNA bases and genomic sequences has expanded rapidly in the past decade (Lucarelli et al. 2004). Techniques for DNA molecule detection usually include nucleic acid hybridization (Southern blot and Northern blot), restriction fragment length polymorphism, PCR and microarray technologies. Most detection systems make use of the hybridization of a target polynucleotide with oligo- or polynucleotide probes containing covalently linked reporter groups, such as radioactive labels, fluorescent labels and chemiluminescence schemes, and so on (Mansfield et al. 1995; Micales and Lyons 2001; Yuan and Wang 2005; Weng and Ren 2006). Each of these strategies has advantages and disadvantages and no single method has gained supremacy. Advances in nanoscience are having a significant impact on the field of biodiagnostics, where a number of nanoparticle-based assays have been introduced for biomolecular detection, with DNA-functionalized nanoparticles used as the target-specific probes (Penn et al. 2003).",

Mirkin for the first time reported a method for using DNA as a synthetically programmable assembler to guide the assembly of nanoparticles modified with complementary oligonucleotides into aggregates, which could be clearly observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) because of high electron densities of Au (Mirkin et al. 1996). Elghanian et al. (1997) further reported a novel method for DNA detection based on a two-probe sandwich hybridization/nanoparticle amplification coloring technique. Wang et al. (2003) detected gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification product on glass slide by visual inspection based on a two-probe sandwich hybridization/silver staining enhancement method. More recent studies (Huber et al. 2004; Bao et al. 2005) revealed that DNA and RNA sample could be detected by microarray-based method, signal amplification by autometallography and subsequent measurement of Au nanoparticle\u2014mediated light scattering.",

The magnetic core/Au shell (Fe@Au) nanoparticles combine the advantage of Au nanoparticles for convenient binding and detection of biomolecules and magnetic particles for easy separation. Water-soluble Fe@Au nanoparticles were synthesized by the reduction of Au3+ onto the surface of magnetic seeds either via iterative hydroxylamine seeding (Jennifer et al. 2004) or by citrate reduction (Lu et al. 2006). Jennifer et al. (2004) reported that iron oxide nanoparticles could maintain their magnetic properties even though coated by Au. Cui et al. (2005) successfully immobilized IgG with Fe@Au nanoparticles with high binding capacity and efficiently detected HBV antigen in a blood with Fe@Au nanoparticles worked as a solid phase substrate. In this paper, we construct Fe@Au nanoparticle HBV DNA gene probes and present their application in detecting HBV DNA.",
