Despite the availability of antibiotics and vaccines against many of the causative pathogens, the mortality rates remain high. According to estimations of the WHO, infectious diseases caused 14.7 million deaths each in 2001, accounting for 26% of the total global mortality (http://www.who.int). AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria furthermore range among the five major obstacles to increased life expectancies (Feachem, 2004).",

As indicated by the appearance and dissemination of the human immunodeficiency virus and the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Krilov, 2004), infectious diseases concern the whole world and can only be solved by internationally coordinated and interdisciplinary approaches. In order to enable and facilitate the long-term control of infectious diseases, molecular biologists, biochemists and pharmacologists have to collaborate closely with physicians, epidemiologists and public health researchers in order to insure the transfer and application of scientific data to the field. In parallel, governmental institutions have to collaborate with private funding partners and industrial partners without losing influence on the research agenda. Control of infections can only be successful if priority is given to combating the individual suffering and its structural and socioeconomic causes rather than to serving political or economic interests (Perkins, 2004; Becker et al., 2003).",

It is notable to see that although diarrhoea and malaria represent the third and fifth most frequent causes of death worldwide they only rank on positions 7 and 8, respectively, in the research priorities.

However, both factors have been largely dismissed by the researchers. Applicability to the field and to clinical work, which would seem important given current challenges, was mentioned third by a distance after originality and impact factor. The relatively low priority that was given to impact on policies, interdisciplinarity and applicability can be understood from a purely scientific point of view. In addition, the answers we obtained were certainly biased by the fact that most scientists whose answers are summarized here were from Western industrialized countries. To investigate this phenomenon systematically, further studies would be required.

Some of the classic researches on vaccines and chemotherapeutic agents aroused moral suspicion and debate already when it was conducted in the late 19th and early 20th century. Studies, among them Robert Koch's and Paul Ehrlich's experiments with Salvarsan and other chemicals, were criticized for insufficient informed consent of study participants and for using vulnerable populations, like people living in \u201cthe colonies\u201d, prisoners, children, or prostitutes (Reuland, 2004; Roelcke and Maio, 2004). The guidelines of the German Reich's Ministry of the Interior of 1930 reacted to the increasingly intense political debate by specifically emphasizing the necessity of explicit informed consent und the moral inadequacy of exploiting a person's difficult social situation for performing studies that pose a risk to the participant's health (Steinmann, 1975). Since then, ethical standards have been further elaborated and laid down in international guidelines, like the Nuremberg Code (1947), the Declaration of Helsinki (1964/2000), and the CIOMS International guidelines on research involving human subjects (2002). When building research capacity in developing countries and intensifying efforts to meet the global challenge of infectious diseases today, we need to make sure that ambition, greed, or even the genuine wish to alleviate and prevent suffering do not compromise these ethical principles that have been agreed on worldwide. It is true that not all questions regarding research ethics have already been settled. Particularly clinical trials that include some form of collaboration between rich countries and developing countries are raising issues, like permissible standards of care for control groups and after-trial obligations, that need to be addressed in a fair and transparent manner.",

However, concerning research priorities, the scientific community should focus on the most prominent diseases affecting large parts of the world's population like diarrhoeal diseases and malaria, but also on neglected diseases like schistosomiasis and trypanosomiasis. Taking into account that national research activities are of course driven by national funding this is a difficult task. Based on the publication activities, the countries with the highest infectious disease burdens are still not given the opportunity to contribute adequately to the scientific field. More political engagement of the scientific community might help to overcome this problem in the long term. According to our survey, the pioneer discoveries in infectious diseases still have the greatest impact; most of these pioneer studies were directly related to (chemo)therapy, prophylaxis or aetiology indicating that applied research is still considered most important.",

But beyond basic research intense efforts are needed to translate these findings into the realm of public policy and public health. And sometimes, mere translation will not be enough. In order to really make a difference we will continuously have to check if our research agenda responds to the most pressing needs rather than to the biggest markets. In order to actually tackle the global challenge of infectious diseases we need to find the best and most efficient ways to transfer knowledge from the labs to the field. As developing countries are the ones for whom the burden of disease is greatest, their participation in the definition of research goals and the implementation of results is essential. Clinical trial partnerships between rich and developing countries are an important step in that direction (cf. for example the European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership, http://www.edctp.org/). We will have to make sure, however, that blind enthusiasm or conflicts of interest do not compromise the ethical dimension of an urgently needed global effort to reduce mortality and burden of infectious diseases.",
