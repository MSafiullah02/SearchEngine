The main feature of the microarray technology is the ability to simultaneously detect multiple analytes in one sample by an affinity-binding event at a surface interface. Fifteen years ago, the gene expression analysis of cDNA on microarrays was one of the first applications that successfully detected thousands of labelled target DNA molecules in parallel [1, 2]. Also the first immunoanalytical microarray was described at the same time [3]. In the meantime, a great variety of target analytes capable of interacting selectively with a biomolecular receptor has been adapted to microarrays.",

They are applied if the number of samples is high or analysis by current methods is difficult and/or expensive [4]. Compared to the routinely applied chromatography techniques like GC or HPLC, immunoanalytical techniques are relatively fast and cost-effective [5, 6]. Therefore, microarray platforms have a great potential as monitoring systems for the rapid assessment of water or food samples [7]. Also other disciplines such as clinical diagnostics (especially point-of-care (POC) diagnostics) or forensic science have a demand for highly multiplexed analytical systems. A microarray platform will be accepted as an analytical system provided that it delivers robust and valid results in combination with a routinely used multiplexed application.",

Data analysis of an analytical microarray is achieved with software for image processing. Using a segmented microarray on a microtitre plate or with a flat slide with barriers, the multiplexed standard concentrations and the samples are separately placed on the segmented microarray and are simultaneously measured after a washing and incubation step. Microarrays on flat substrates with one flow channel can be calibrated sequentially if they are regenerable. Single-usable microarrays need, for each multi-analyte concentration, a separate microarray and positive and negative control spots. A solution to this problem is a microarray with multiple parallel flow channels using one channel for sample analysis and the other for calibration. Microarrays for screening applications have only positive and negative control spots to ensure that threshold limits for positive responses are maintained and that non-specific adsorption does not create a false-negative signal.",

Analyte derivatives are immobilized using the indirect assay format reacting with the receptor molecules from the liquid phase (Fig. 2a,b). The reverse arrangement is the direct assay format by immobilization of receptor molecules as capture molecules (Fig. 2c). Molecules with different binding positions are detected by use of a sandwich assay format (Fig. 2d). The substrate is the ground surface for building up the microarray step-by-step. The top layer is activated in a way that capture molecules or analyte-derivatives are directly immobilized on to the spotted matrix. The quantification of analytes with a microarray is achieved by multiple affinity reactions. The affinity reaction is an equilibrium reaction strongly depending on the concentration of analytes, since the receptor and the other reagents are present at constant concentrations. Small analytes are quantified by an indirect competitive assay format using, preferentially, multiple antibodies. In this case the binding reaction takes place in solution. Only the free antibodies at low analyte concentration react with the immobilized analyte derivatives at the surface. The binding of antibodies at the surface is detected with a microarray readout system such as depicted in Fig. 3 with a chemiluminescence microarray readout principle. Flow-through analytical microarray platforms automatically deliver samples, and reagent solutions and washing buffer, by connection to a fluidic system.\n\n",

In contrast with quantitative analytical microarrays using native unlabelled analytes, for screening applications the target analyte is labelled. The types of microarrays depend on the immobilized capture molecule. Since 2000, protein microarrays have been used for high-throughput protein analysis [36, 37]. Three test formats are used: functional, quantitative, and reversed-phase microarrays [38]. Cell lysates are immobilized and react with labelled antibodies by applying the reverse-phase microarray format [39, 40]. Quantitative protein microarrays use a sandwich immunoassay format [41]. Functional protein microarrays have immobilized antigen (cell, protein, or other). In clinical diagnostic applications the functional protein microarray is also called an antigen microarray. They present at each spot a recognition molecule for one specific antibody. With this format allergens have been immobilized for screening of allergen-specific IgE in human serum [42]. Autoantigens have also been spotted to quantify autoantibodies in the sera of patients with autoimmune disease [43]. The immobilization of cells in a microarray format is another application in clinical diagnostics, e.g. for diagnosis of sepsis [44], but also in other fields such as drug screening [45, 46], or screening of successful DNA transfection [47]. Peptide microarrays are applied for epitope mapping, antibody profiling, or drug screening [48\u201350]. Carbohydrate [51, 52], receptor [53], or enzyme [54] microarrays are also developed for drug discovery. DNA microarrays have not only been developed for gene expression analysis but also for detection of microorganisms and viruses in food and water analysis and for clinical diagnostics. Semi-quantitative results are obtained by using PCR combined with a labelling procedure before the microarrays are analysed [55\u201359].",

Polystyrene [60], acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) [61], poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) [62], and nitrocellulose substrates are very effective for non-covalent antibody attachment. After immobilization, these microarrays have to be blocked intensively in order that the non-specific binding of labelled molecules is reduced. However, high background signals significantly reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of directly adsorptive substrates [63]. Also the desorption of antibodies during washing steps is observed. The only advantage of plastic and nitrocellulose substrates is that no chemical treatment is required.

The covalent attachment of haptens, antibodies, or other capture molecules is necessary for automated analytical microarrays using flow channels. The desorption of capture molecules has to be prevented. Currently, gold surfaces and plastic microarrays are described less often in the literature, even though covalent coating is as easy as silane chemistry. Self assembled monolayers are formed reproducibly on gold layers with sulfur-containing compounds [64] and can easily be implemented in analytical microarrays [65]. Plastic substrates are activated by photochemistry producing radicals on the surface [66, 67]. With all these strategies a monolayer for covalent attachment is created. This first step serves for activation of the substrate. Glass substrates are generally activated with silanes. They carry terminal head groups like amines, epoxides, thiols or aldehydes which are used for immobilization of proteins [68]. This strategy works also for other molecules containing a terminal amino group such as amine-modified oligonucleotides and haptens. For covalent attachment of proteins, DNA or other molecules, aminosilane-coated glass slides have to be derivatised with a homobifunctional crosslinker. Mercaptosilane-coated glass slides use a heterobifunctional crosslinker. Aldehyde and epoxide-coated slides react directly with terminal amine groups. The silanization process does not produce a high-density monolayer [69, 70]. The free binding sites for non-specific adsorption have to be blocked intensively with proteins such as BSA. The reproducibility and the signal-to-noise ratio is much higher compared with directly immobilized molecules [71].",

Another advantage of PEG surfaces is the stabilizing effect of immobilized proteins or antibodies on glass substrates [83]. The surface provides a chemical moiety suitable for step-by-step modification. Various methods are available for covalently coupling haptens or capture molecules to surfaces. For instance, the coated surface can be modified to display terminal amine, thiol, or carboxy groups capable of reacting with homobifunctional or heterobifunctional crosslinkers. Homobifunctional crosslinkers have two identical coupling groups such as N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters, maleimides, epoxides, or aldehydes. A heterobifunctional crosslinker has two different coupling groups. The activated surfaces are suitable for coupling primary amines or thiols. Surfaces coated with PEGs have a monolayer structure.

Diverse micropipetting systems based on ink-jet principles such as thermal [86], piezo-electrically actuated [87], and syringe-solenoid [88] based technologies have been adapted from printing technologies [89]. The newer techniques consist of high-parallel microdispensing devices, such as the TopSpot technology, which acts by using piezo-triggered, short, pneumatic pressure pulses [90, 91]. These non-contact printing systems are used for high-throughput microarray production because of the advantage offered by the very fast printing process. The printing solution is transferred to a reservoir of the pump head and can be delivered to a considerable number of slides as carrier substrate. By using multiple microdispensing units on the printing system the process is made parallel and, therefore, more cost-efficient. The limitation of these non-contact printing devices is the high technical effort required for installing a robot system and the accuracy of microdispensing. The spotting buffer often contains salts and detergents that prevent adsorption on the walls of the microtitre plates used for storage of the printing solution. The disadvantage of added supplementary compounds is that the printing head can become irreversibly clogged. In contrast, the printing process of contact printers is very reproducible and the contact pins have a long lifetime. Solid pins or split pins (contact printing) [2, 92] and microstructured stamps (microcontact printing) [93, 94] have been further developed for diverse microarray formats such as protein, cell, tissue or other microarray formats [95\u201398]. The printing principle is adapted from stamping or fountain pens. The print head is dipped into the spotting solution and the molecules are transferred to the flat support by contact with the slide. The printing process of all systems is fully automated. For both microprinting technologies regulation of the temperature and humidity is highly essential, since the reproducibility of the printing process depends strongly on maintaining evaporation of the analyte solution on the printing head at a constant rate.",

Today fluorophores with emission in the far red and NIR range are commercially available. New diode lasers are currently available for excitation in the wavelength range between the UV and the visible. This enables use of new fluorophores such as quantum dots or other fluorescence nanoparticles [105, 106]. Also time-resolved fluorescence is possible for microarray readout systems by using an UV laser [107]. The sensitivity of fluorescence microarrays can be increased with time-resolved fluorescence readout systems. For short decay times background fluorescence and light scattering are no longer detectable after some microseconds. Another sensitive optical microarray readout technique is based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) combined with fluorescence [108]. Surface plasmons can be excited in noble metals by resonance coupling with a light beam of a laser. The local enhancement of the optical field associated with surface plasmons can then be used to excite surface-bound fluorophores. The distance to the surface should be between 10 and 20 nm, otherwise the fluorophores are quenched or ineffectively excited [109].

CL microarray readout systems use the effect of light emission caused by a chemical reaction. Every assay format developed as ELISA in microwell platforms is adaptable as a multiplexed assay on CL microarrays. The principle of CL microarrays is based on multiple affinity reactions which are detected in parallel with localized chemiluminescence labels. Enzymes with a short half-life, for example HRP, are required. The light emission takes place very close to the enzyme label by incubation with the CL reagent, e.g. luminol. This reacts with H2O2 in the presence of HRP, with light emission at 425 nm [110]. The CL reagent is pumped into the flow cell and the discrete close-to-the-surface chemiluminescence reaction is imaged. The reaction is stopped after a defined time. Only endpoint measurements are possible because of the washing step between the affinity reaction and the chemiluminescence reaction. CCD or CMOS chips image the CL microarrays. The readout system of CL microarrays can be build up very compactly. Optical components like an exciting light source (laser or lamp), filters and mirrors are not needed. CL microarray instrumentation can even be integrated into a miniaturized handheld system for applications in POC diagnostics and food and water quality monitoring.",

Moreover, the signal intensity per HRP molecule can be increased using optimised luminol analogues and enhancers [112, 113]. The signal can also be increased by surface-enhanced CL.

The enzyme reaction is so sensitive that very small amounts of unspecifically bound enzymes can be detected as a background signal. Small amounts of the enzymes can also remain in a fluidic system with valves and pumps. Surfaces which prevent unspecific binding are necessary, as also are intensive washing steps. Another point is that the sensitivity of the CL depends on the enzyme activity. An enzymatic turnover rate depends on temperature and the concentration of the CL reagent. Both should be constant during the analysis. Automated CL microarray platforms have to be temperature-controlled. This is an important point, especially for robust conditions of analysis over a whole working day.",

Capture molecules are immobilized on quantitative microarrays. The proteome is labelled and incubated with the microarray. In contrast, the other format uses immobilized cell lysates and labelled proteins for screening the functional activity of a protein. There are also microarrays adapted from immunoassay formats in microwell plates. Depending on the readout system they are called fluorescence or chemiluminescence microarray immunoassays (F-MIA or CL-MIA). All these kinds of microarray have one reaction area and a integrated fluidic system is absent. Samples and assay reagents are placed on top of the microarray and are passively incubated. After this incubation step the slides are cleaned and dried. For read out, the microarrays are placed in an appropriate detection system (fluorescence or chemiluminescence microarray reader). Many manual process steps (washing, drying, transfer to reader) are required. The microarrays are used only once. For calibration, positive and negative controls are often included to ensure that threshold limits for positive responses are maintained and that non-specific adsorption does not create a false negative result. This type of analytical microarray is used for screening applications by obtaining semi-quantitative results. If quantitative results are required, each slide is analysed for one multi-analyte concentration. Passive incubation steps dramatically increase the assay time. These platforms are very helpful for protein screening applications in proteome analysis. However, they will not gain acceptance in the field of on-site analysis of food, water, or diagnostics. Some examples of passively incubated microarrays are given as some of these applications could be adapted to flow-through microarrays.",

The expanded laser beam is launched into the edge of a waveguide (microscope slide) resulting in an evanescent field. A bandpass filter eliminates excitation and scattered light prior to imaging. Some array-based biosensors have the feature of special imaging optics consisting of a two-dimensional array of graded index (GRIN) lenses to provide uniform excitation in the sensing area of the waveguide on to a CCD camera.\n\n",

The standard assay time is 15 min. Whole cells have a smaller diffusion coefficient than small organic molecules. As a result, the incubation time needed for the heterogeneous immunoreaction is greater.

Fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and electrochemistry currently dominate as 2D readout systems for analytical platforms. Fluorescence and chemiluminescence microarray platforms, especially, are used for detection of pesticides and pharmaceuticals in an indirect competitive immunoassay format. Protein target toxins, clinical biomarkers, or microorganisms are analysed with a sandwich immunoassay format. The detection methods are optimized for selectivity, sensitivity, and low limits of detection. The assay performance depends now more on the availability of antibodies with high affinity constants and low cross-reactivity. Total assay times are in the range of minutes, which is only possible in fully automated systems under non-equilibrium conditions. Only a few flow-through microarray platforms exist at the moment, consisting of an automated fluidic system for rapid and reproducible multiplexed applications. Automated analytical microarray platforms will compete with applications that completely solve a relevant multi-analyte problem, e.g. the quantification of possible contaminants such as antibiotics in milk, toxins in food, or microorganisms in drinking water. Further example include detection of doping drugs during a sport event, prevention of a bioterrorist attack, or the accurate and early diagnosis of a tumour marker.\n\n",

In a central laboratory, chromatography techniques and/or mass spectrometry are established. They will persist in the future, as long as further confirmation in food and water analysis or clinical diagnostics, with independent techniques, is needed to exclude false-positive results. Nevertheless, immunochemical methods are seen as one type of screening technique for water and food monitoring [199]. In clinical diagnostics immunoassays are accepted. The automated systems analyse single analyte in blood samples. Multi-analyte detection would reduce the costs of analysis. However, the different antigen/antibody complexes have to be compatible with a single microarray platform. Nowadays, antibodies are available for many analytes, although most of them are not applied to analytical microarrays. A reliable microarray platform needs validated reagents including DNA or antibodies and standard analytes. Furthermore, the characterization and validation of the immobilized capture molecules and the coating have to be improved.",
