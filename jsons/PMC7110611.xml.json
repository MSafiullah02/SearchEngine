Since its discovery in the 1950s, the majority of cases have been documented in HIV patients with low CD4 counts. In northern Thailand, T. marneffei is the fourth most prevalent opportunistic infection in this population (Chariyalertsak et al., 2001). Clinical manifestations include fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, cough, and hepatosplenomegaly (Wu et al., 2008). While the frequency of T. marneffei infection has decreased with the advent of retroviral therapy, if left untreated the infection frequently leads to respiratory failure with a poor prognosis.",

Indirect serological results help to make faster decisions given that cultures take several days or weeks to grow. Clinical and geographic context plays a particularly important role because some of these tests have been shown to have cross-reactivities. Pulmonary infection either by fungi, bacteria or virus has been observed to cause concomitant hyponatremia, with inappropriate levels of anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) often found as the underlying etiology. The exact mechanism is not understood but hypoxemia and hypercapnia are thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology (Rose et al., 1984).",

These infections in their disseminated forms will receive amphotericin-B with itraconazole.

ADH is produced on the paraventricular thalamic nucleus and thus classically this syndrome is observed after neurological insults that cause an excess in ADH. Nevertheless, it has been observed that respiratory tract infections can cause inadequate ADH secretion and these are the most common infections in HIV patients. Increase in the A-a gradient and hypoxia/hypercapnia-induced ADH secretion are some of the non-osmotic mechanisms thought to trigger elevations in ADH in this population. It has been proposed that hypercapnic acidosis and hypoxemia induce central release of vasopressin through peripheral chemoreceptors and baroreceptors stimulation respectively (Rose et al., 1984, Dreyfuss et al., 1988). Tuberculosis, cryptosporidium, plasmodium infections and Pneumocystis pneumonia have been previously reported as pulmonary infections causing SIADH. It is of note that HIV by itself could contribute to SIADH. But the mechanism underlying this infection is usually mediated by HIV induced thyroid and adrenal insufficiency. In our case, the patient had increased urinary sodium, decreased serum osmolality, normal cortisol and TSH levels and absence of neurological affect, leaving the pulmonary fungal infection as one of the explanations for inadequate ADH secretion.",
