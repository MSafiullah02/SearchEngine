The viruses differed remarkably in their capability to induce signs of disease in pigs. The viruses isolated in 2009 and 2010 induced severe dyspnea in pigs, whereas viruses isolated in 2014 and 2015 failed to do so (Figure 1). With respect to the dyspnea score, the HA09 strain was most virulent inducing strong dyspnea in all pigs even 6 days after infection (Figure 1). HA09 was also the only virus that caused the death of some animals; 3 of 17 pigs died within the first 2\u20136 days after infection, indicating a mortality of about 18%. Two dyspnea peaks (1 dpi and 4\u20136 dpi) were observed after infection with JE09. The JE10 A(H1N1)pdm09 induced strong dyspnea 1 dpi that gradually decreased the following days. Low virulence was determined for the strains SC14 and KI15, which showed only slightly increased values. A difference between the viruses was also observed when the rectal temperature was measured. The viruses isolated in 2009\u20132010 induced fever, that is, >40\u00b0C. A short duration of fever is typical for influenza A virus infections of pigs. Strains SC14 or KI15 did not affect the rectal temperature (Figure 2).The pigs infected with 2009\u20132010 viruses displayed significantly more severe macroscopic lung lesions in comparison to pigs infected with viruses isolated in 2014\u20132015 (Figure 3A). The lesions were visible at least up to 9 dpi. Only marginal lesions were detectable in pigs infected by strains SC14 or KI15 (Figure 3A). In all animals, virus was detectable in the lungs at 1 and 3 dpi, but not at 9 dpi. The viral lung load after infection differed between the strains: Viruses isolated in 2009 induced significantly increased viral lung loads on 1 dpi when compared to virus isolated in 2010 (P \u2264 .006); the latter induced a significantly higher viral lung load on 1 dpi in comparison to 2014 and 2015 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (P < .001; Figure 3B).",

For this purpose, ALI cultures were subjected to DAPI staining to visualize nuclei and to immunostaining with anti-\u03b2-tubulin antibodies to visualize cilia. As shown in Figure 6A, in vertical sections, the thickness of the samples infected by SC14 or KI15 was somewhat reduced compared to uninfected cultures. A stronger reduction was observed in ALI cultures infected by JE10. An even more pronounced reduction of the epithelial thickness was detectable after infection by HA09 or JE09.

The KI15 as well as the SC14 virus were less virulent than the others. Pigs from an age of 6 months onward usually develop less pronounced signs of disease after influenza A virus infection (R. D\u00fcrrwald, unpublished data). The difference of 4\u20135 weeks in age of pigs of the KI15 group in comparison to the other groups can be neglected, especially since a similar virus (SC14) showed similar characteristics. Despite the fact that the JE09 and the JE10 viruses induced disease in pigs, a comparison of the virulence parameters (dyspnea, lung lesions, virus load) indicated a gradual decrease in the virulence already in these early isolates of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses: HA09 > JE09 > JE10 (see P values in the Results and the figure legends). The data support the notion that there is a gradual adaptation of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses to their new hosts associated with a reduction in their capacity to induce severe disease. This process took place in humans and was shared by the virus isolated from a pig. The results obtained with our pig model point to an evolution of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus toward lower virulence.",

These results indicate that a regeneration process has occurred that compensated for the loss of ciliated cells. Our findings are consistent with the clinical symptoms observed in pigs. Reduced mucociliary clearance efficiency may contribute to the severity of dyspnea. Virus release over an extended time period and release of apoptotic cells may lead to an obstruction of bronchioli by cell debris. The quick recovery of most pigs may be favored by the sustained barrier functions and by the regeneration process of the airway epithelium.",

In the case of spillover infections, the virus has to modify its replication properties to propagate in the new host [30]. Since the first isolation of a human influenza virus, 3 different subtypes, H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2, had been successful in establishing virus lineages in the human population. Viruses of other subtypes (eg, H5N1, H7N9) occasionally infect humans and may cause severe or fatal disease in infected individuals; however, these viruses were so far not able to spread the infection among the population, which is a sign of insufficient adaptation to the spillover host [27, 31, 32]. The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was able to replace the seasonal H1N1 lineage. The adaptation of the virus to the human host was accompanied\u2014as demonstrated by our data\u2014by a reduction of virulence for pigs. The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus is easily transmitted between humans and pigs but transmission between humans seems to be more easily accomplished than that between pigs because the virus did only rarely establish stable lineages after primary incursion into the pig population and preferred to acquire new genes (ie, N2) before establishing stable propagation in pigs [33]. Thus, the original A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was most probably not yet well adapted to mammalian species, including pigs and humans, despite its ability to replicate efficiently in the latter. This may be the reason for the severe course of disease in infection experiments with HA09 and JE09 virus.",

Similar findings were reported by others that compared the virulence of early pandemic H1N1 viruses in ferrets and mice [34, 35]. A different picture was obtained when the virulent viruses were compared with the low-virulent viruses. Among the different influenza virus genes, a total of 20 amino acid changes were found that distinguished these 2 groups of viruses (Supplementary Table 2). The successful establishment of the new virus lineage is evident from the fact that all 84 sequences of human A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that have been isolated in different parts of Germany and deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data repository share the 20 amino acid changes mentioned above. None of these amino acids is known to be a marker for virulence. Thus, these mutations may reflect adaptations to human cells.",

Our observations with ALI cultures are consistent with pathological changes reported for samples derived from diseased patients or animals [20, 35, 36]. The affected epithelium frequently shows only a single layer of flattened basilar epithelial cells covering the basement membrane. Viruses with different virulence differ in the size of the foci of infection that are characterized by the loss of cilia. With this in vitro culture system available that\u2014upon infection by influenza virus\u2014reflects the virulence characteristics of the respective virus, it will be much easier to analyze the importance of individual mutations or combinations of amino acid exchanges or epigenetic mechanisms with respect to virulence in pigs. In future studies, it will be interesting to find out whether the porcine in vitro cell culture model can also be applied to viruses of other species, for example, avian influenza viruses, and to determine whether the virulence-related differences between human influenza viruses are also observed upon infection of human differentiated airway epithelial cells.",
