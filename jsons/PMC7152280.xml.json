Patients in this study received 100 to 150 mg/day lamivudine in conjunction with pulse steroids, plasma exchange, hemodiafiltration, and use of experimental protease inhibitors to avoid disseminated intravascular coagulation (Table 96.5\n). Lamivudine was associated with a 0.25 (0.07\u20130.91) hazard ratio for mortality. Another retrospective study did not replicate this, finding no mortality benefit from viral suppression.42 However, the authors recommended considering nucleoside inhibitor therapy anyway, because it may reduce the risk of recurrence posttransplant. The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease suggests considering lamivudine (and possibly other agents) for acute hepatitis B but notes evidence is equivocal and rates this a level III recommendation.43 Given the paucity of evidence, such agents should be considered only in conjunction with expert consultation.",
