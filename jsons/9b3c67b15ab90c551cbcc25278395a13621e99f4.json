We conducted a literature review of urology mHealth papers on PubMed. Results indicate that mHealth is becoming ubiquitous in contemporary healthcare systems. Although its potential has been shown, urology lags behind other areas, representing just 0.1% of the 300,000 available medical apps in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Furthermore, there is a lack of expert healthcare professional involvement in app development. To avoid harm, it is critical that the scientific accuracy, patient privacy, and user safety of urology mHealth applications are assured. This is because there is no globally enforced medical app regulation, compulsory scientific guidelines, nor mandatory industry standards. Urologists, either individually or via scientific organizations, should have a pivotal position in the design, development, review, certification, and recommendation of apps. mHealth holds great potential in urology, as it can aid multiple stakeholders: citizens, patients, healthcare professionals, health organizations, and public authorities (e.g., Ministry of Health). Even though it is mostly used to improve existing medical activities at present, the future will include revolutionary and ground-breaking technology solutions. This innovative field should be seen by urologists as an opportunity to provide greater care to our patients and better tools and knowledge to our peers.",

In December 2017, after a 200% growth in the number of mHealth apps, an updated urology review was performed, which identified a 17% increase in the number of urology apps: 67 (38%) available exclusively for Android, 62 (35%) only for iOS, and 47 (27%) presented on both stores (Table 1 ) [8] . However, there are currently over 300,000 mHealth apps available in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, which shows there is a significant discrepancy between the increase in all mHealth and urology apps, that is, 200% and 17%, respectively [9] .

However, most mHealth apps are not developed by large enterprises: one-third are developed by single individuals, and another third by small companies (i.e., with staff between two and nine employees) [22] . Some developers might not have the resources to include a healthcare professional in the app's team. Developing a scientifically valid and appropriately designed mHealth app might require input from experts in several fields of science, and healthcare professionals have the deontological duty to remain stakeholders in this process. The level of scrutiny should match the potential health hazards, and the degree of regulation should be proportional to the clinical implication derived from the app, ranging from low (e.g., apps that give access to online medical journals, which only show content that has already been peer-reviewed) to high (e.g., apps that dispense clinical advice). mHealth in urology is still in its infancy, like in many other medical disciplines. Currently, this new technology is mostly used to improve and optimize existing medical activities, but one of the most promising areas where mHealth in urology could be developed is patient self-management. Implementing a shared-decision model process changes the quality of patient-provider communication and can improve patients' satisfaction not only with the health decision per se, but also with the process itself [23] . Studies have shown that cancer patients who are more engaged in their health decisions are more likely to be satisfied with their choices [23] .",
