Along with the growing threat of this infectious disease, there have been increasing reports of a variety of cures, potions and lotions that purport to effectively treat COVID-19. Many of these come from the world of TCIM, many of them based on misinformation or misunderstanding of COVID-19, and many of them potentially dangerous.",

In Australia, one high-profile homeopathy practitioner has had regulatory, legislative and court action taken against them multiple times for their promotion of homeopathic medicines as the solution to everything from vaccine injury to SARS to radiation from nuclear power plant explosions [1] . But even beyond these extreme examples, there may be many cases of well-meaning TCIM practitioners who want to assist patients in need in times of a crisis such as that posed by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the role of TCIM may be relatively limited, attempts to assist may actually cause harm, and efforts of the TCIM community may be better spent working with the public health community in their endeavours.",
