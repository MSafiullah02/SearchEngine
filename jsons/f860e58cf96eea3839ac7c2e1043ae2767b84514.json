Using four criteria proposed a decade ago by Brooks & McLennan to identify a case of adaptive radiation indicates that the evolutionary history of the viviparous clade of the Gyrodactylidae is dominated by nonvicariant processes. The viviparous clade, with 446 species, has significantly more species than its sister clade (one species), and high species richness was shown to be an apomorphic trait of only the viviparous gyrodactylids within the Gyrodactylidae. Reconciliation of the phylogenetic tree of the viviparous Gyrodactylidae with that of its hosts showed a low probability for cospeciation suggesting that adaptive modes of speciation and not vicariance were predominant during the historical diversification of the clade. The proposed hypothesis suggests that the Gyrodactylidae originated on the South American continent about 60 Mya after geographical dispersal and host switching of its common ancestor to demersal freshwater catfishes by a marine ancestor. Development of hyperviviparity and the consequent loss of 'sticky' eggs in conjunction with other symplesiomorphic and apomorphic features allowed rapid diversification coupled with high dispersal to new host groups and geographical areas by viviparous members of the Gyrodactylidae.",

At birth, the progenetic offspring is usually a pregnant worm with subsequent generations of worms already present in its uterus (see ; and references therein). Gyrodactylids have a direct monoxenic life cycle, but contrary to most monogenoid species, transmission is via the preadult /adult stage.

If the Gyrodactylidae originated relatively recently in continental South America as suggested by members of its basal clades occurring on loricariid catfishes that date back to only 66 Mya (Berg 1958) , how did the viviparous lineage that developed from an oviparous ancestor become so diverse and widely distributed on different host groups in the various geographical regions and environments throughout the world? This paper tests the hypothesis that the viviparous Gyrodactylidae shows high diversification primarily as a consequence of extensive adaptive radiation. We accomplish this by evaluating the four criteria proposed by Brooks & McLennan (1993b) that they hypothesize must be met to identify a case of adaptive radiation: ' (1) the group in question contains more species than its sister group;",

(Brooks & McLennan 1993b) If met, the first two criteria indicate that the group shows high species richness that is a result of a historical increase in diversification (speciation minus extinction). That the increase in diversification is a consequence of adaptive radiation is supported if the last two criteria are met. The third criterion also allows recognition of possible key innovations linked to the increase in diversification of the clade.",

Tests with both the lineage splitting model and the estimation of diversification rates support the hypothesis that diversification in the viviparous clade is significantly higher than that of its sister group ( Hyperopletes ); sensitivity tests using the various combinations of possible sister groups also indicate significantly smaller species richness in these hypothetical sister groups than in the viviparous clade (Tables 2 and 3) . While the number of species of viviparous gyrodactylids is large ( n = 446) compared to its sister groups, the majority (90%) of these species is allocated to Gyrodactylus ( n = 402); the number of species in the remaining viviparous genera varies between one and seven species each (Table 1 ). This may suggest that the diverse group is, in fact, Gyrodactylus , and not the entire lineage of viviparous species. However, taxonomy of the viviparous clade is problematic, and all available evidence suggests that while most of the other generic groups are monophyletic, i.e. supported by well-defined synapomorphies, the same is not true for Gyrodactylus (see Kritsky & Boeger, 2003) . Species presently allocated to Gyrodactylus do not share any exclusive derived character that would suggest immediate common ancestry. Kritsky & Boeger (2003) included 35 species of Gyrodactylus and one species each of Gyrodactyloides , Gyrdicotylus , Acanthoplacatus and Fundulotrema as ingroup taxa in a preliminary phylogenetic analysis of the viviparous clade to test monophyly of Gyrodactylus . This analysis showed that Gyrodactylus lacks monophyly, with species of Acanthoplacatus and Fundulotrema having developed from respective ancestors within Gyrodactylus . In this analysis, which used molecular data, the clade Gyrdicotylus + Gyrodactyloides appears to be the sister group of the clade including species of Gyrodactylus , Acanthoplacatus and Fundulotrema (Fig. 2 ). Since the current classification scheme of viviparous gyrodactylids is apparently unnatural and Gyrodactylus paraphyletic, it appears likely that the entire viviparous group represents the diverse taxon rather than Gyrodactylus alone.",

All other clades depict species richness significantly lower than their respective sister group. Optimization of the relative number of species of respective clades of the Gyrodactylidae ( Fig. 1) shows that high species richness of the viviparous clade is apomorphic. Boeger et al . (1994) identified three synapomorphies, all associated with reproduction and /or the reproductive system, that define the hypothetical common ancestor of the viviparous gyrodactylids: (1) copulatory sac modified into a muscular bulb; (2) mode of reproduction shifted from oviparity to viviparity (hyperviviparity); and (3) loss of Mehlis' gland. While it is difficult to visualize how modification of the copulatory organ into a muscular bulb and loss of Mehlis' gland could lead to adaptive speciation, the remaining synapomorphy in conjunction with other plesiomorphic and apomorphic features (Table 5 ) appear to form a suite of traits that could enhance adaptively driven modes within the viviparous clade. Pre-existing (symplesiomorphic) features of viviparous gyrodactylids, i.e. ectoparasitism, loss of the free-living oncomiracidium, a monoxenic life cycle and transmission by preadult/adult stages, did not together or individually lead to or promote adaptive speciation but apparently were important antecedents. *Direct application of the formula provided in the text would generate a lower limit for the CI that is slightly higher than the ML estimate of the diversification rate. This occurs because the formula is an approximation which treats the ML estimate as a continuous random variable, whereas in reality the variable can only take on discrete values. As a result, the formula is appropriate for 'reasonably' sized clades but breaks down at the edges when very small clades are included (modified from a statement provided by S. Nee, pers.comm.). Species of Udonellidae, Acanthocotylidae and the basal oviparous groups of Gyrodactylidae produce an egg with an adhesive droplet at or near the tip of the proximal polar filament (Boeger & Kritsky 2001) . The droplet serves to secure eggs individually or as clusters on hard surfaces where embryonic development occurs (Kearn 1986 (Kearn , 1998 . Hard surfaces may include those provided by the host, such as the exoskeleton of a parasitic copepod in the case of udonellids Kritsky & Boeger (2003) and Boeger et al. (1994) .

The host cladogram is a composite developed from Lauder & Liem (1983) , Forey et al. (1996) , Fink & Fink (1996) , and Johnson & Patterson (1996) . Black circles refer to host taxa from which species of Gyrodactylidae have been reported and described; grey circles indicate host taxa from which species of Gyrodactylidae are reported but not described; white circles indicate host taxa from which no species of Gyrodactylidae has been reported or described. (Boeger et al. 1994 ); species of Acanthocotylidae may utilize other substrates such as sand grains or rocks or the eggs may be retained on the body of the parent worm (Macdonald & Llewellyn 1980; Kearn 1993) . In all of these families, the ecloded larva lacks cilia and thus is incapable of actively seeking a new host.",

However, this character likely reduced ability for dispersal to new host species by limiting the spectrum of possible target hosts to those with hard surfaces or with specific behavioural characteristics. This hypothesis is supported by the limited array of host groups parasitized by members of the Udonellidae (caligid copepods), Acanthocotylidae (demersal /gregarious rays, teleosts and agnathans) and the oviparous Gyrodactylidae (demersal /armored catfishes). In those taxa in which the eggs are cemented to the hard surfaces of the host (udonellids and oviparous gyrodactylids), host switching appears to be even more limited than in the Acanthocotylidae where the eggs are deposited on hard surfaces not necessarily associated with the host. The egglaying behaviour of acanthocotylids likely increases somewhat the spectrum of demersal fishes that could serve as hosts for the group through host switching.",

Acquired host-defence mechanisms are known to exist against monogenoids (Buchmann & Lindenstr\u00f8m 2002 ; and references therein) and have been held responsible for the observed declines in infrapopulations of gyrodactylids on individual hosts (Scott & Anderson 1984) . Further, Gyrodactylus salaris, and probably most gyrodactylids, can survive for extended periods as adults on host carcasses (Harris 1980) or on the bottoms of lakes and rivers, while retaining a potential to re-infest new host specimens (Bakke et al. 1992 ). This ability of moving from one host to another in order to evade consequences of host defensive responses or its death (see also , could be an important attribute that favours colonization of a new host species by increasing probability of survival of the founder/ seed and its descendant population. The success of host switching with subsequent acquisition of identity (speciation) was apparently increased by development of new features (apomorphies) in the ancestor of the viviparous lineage. Viviparity (hyperviviparity) appears to have greatly facilitated successful colonization of new hosts by accelerating growth of the invading infrapopulation. Compared to that of their oviparous sister groups, embryonic development in viviparous gyrodactylids is extended and protected in the uterus, while progenesis and protogyny of these helminths accelerate their maturation and reproduction. Offspring are born as adult or near adult females and may reproduce as early as one day after birth (Scott 1982) . These apomorphic characters (hyperviviparity, progenesis and protogyny) could have enhanced the probability for successful new host invasions during the evolutionary development of the viviparous clade.",

            "text": "The proposed model for the mechanisms involved in the adaptive radiation of viviparous gyrodactlids is provided in Fig. 4 . The model suggests that hosts harbouring one (or more) genetically diverse species of viviparous Gyrodactylidae have ample opportunities for infesting other sympatric host species (1st level, upper portion). In most cases, these host transfers result in extinction of the invading lineage because of the inability of the invader or its descendants to adapt to the environmental conditions imposed by the new host (2nd level, upper portion). However, should the invader possess appropriate genetic and /or morphological attributes for compatibility, the parasite rapidly colonizes the newly invaded host, undergoing genetic drift by parthenogenesis followed by sexual reproduction to form a less genetically diverse, albeit adapted, population. Features that allowed successful host switching quickly become fixed in the parasite population. Subsequent mutation and selection eventually results in genetic diversification and speciation as age of the new relationship increases (3rd level, upper portion); cospeciation between the new parasite lineage and that of the acquired host could subsequently occur. This scenario of host switching followed by peripheral speciation in other hosts is often repeated during development of respective gyrodactylid clades (4th level, upper portion). A similar scenario also occurs if a host and its parasites disperse geographically (lower portion of Fig. 4) . Initial reduction in genetic and/or morphological variability due to inability of most variants to survive in the new environment occurs. However, as the parasite-host system ages in the new area, the same mechanisms described above will promote variability, host switching and peripheral speciation among gyrodactylid lineages.",

            "text": "According to available phylogenetic hypotheses, the Gyrodactylidae originated in the freshwater environments of South America as parasites of armoured catfishes (Loricariidae), a primary freshwater family restricted to the Neotropical Region. Origin of the Gyrodactylidae was apparently associated with a host-switching event by an oviparous marine ancestor that colonized freshwater after the separation of South America from Africa. That the invading ancestor was marine and oviparous is supported by the phylogenetic hypothesis of Boeger & Kritsky (2001) , who indicated that all other gyrodactylidean families (Tetraonchoididae, Bothitrematidae, Anoplodiscidae, Udonellidae, and Acanthocotylidae), which include only oviparous monogenoids parasitic on marine hosts, are either basal to or form the sister group of the Gyrodactylidae. Berg (1958) indicates that the earliest known fossils of loricariid catfishes (hosts to members of the basal oviparous groups of Gyrodactylidae) date back to only 66 Mya. By this time, South America was isolated from Africa as well as from all other continental landmasses. While oviparous gyrodactylids from non-Neotropical hosts would be expected if the Gyrodactylidae had originated prior to the fragmentation of Gondwanaland, no oviparous species is known from native hosts outside the Neotropics. Extinction could explain the absence of oviparous gyrodactylids in Africa and/or other regions outside South America, but such an extensive event by parasite species is unlikely to have occurred.",

            "text": "The viviparous lineage of gyrodactylids is apparently monophyletic (Kritsky & Boeger, 2003) . Unlike their oviparous counterparts, viviparous gyrodactylids occur on fishes representing a large number of families and orders from all of the world's oceans and continents (except perhaps Antarctica). If oviparous gyrodactylids gave rise to the viviparous clade as the phylogeny suggests ( Fig. 1) , origin of the viviparous clade probably also occurred in South America. Once freed of the limiting features associated with their egglaying ancestors, the early viviparous gyrodactylids became capable of dispersing into new hosts and new environments where peripheral speciation became possible. Indeed, phylogenetic analyses of comparatively few of the total number of viviparous species known to science (Fig. 2) , suggests a complex pattern of dispersal and speciation of the viviparous gyrodactylids throughout the world (Fig. 3) . Brooks & McLennan (1993a) postulated that the evolution of direct life cycles and autoinfection influenced the rates of adaptively driven speciation in monogenoids and suggested that development of viviparity in gyrodactylids provides additional support for this hypothesis. However, Lydeard (1993) found little evidence to support viviparity influencing diversification in actinopterygean fishes when comparing several clades of fishes in which viviparity had independently developed. He (1993) suggested that '\u2026 adherence to a particular taxon's success being due to the evolution of viviparity may be nothing more than wishful thinking.' Although viviparity is a synapomorphy of the viviparous clade of gyrodactylids, we also cannot say that this mode of reproduction by itself represents the key innovation for diversification in the clade. It appears, however, that the success of the viviparous gyrodactylids is probably due to a suite of characters, both plesiomorphic and apomorphic, that fortuitously coexisted in the common ancestor of the clade (Table 5) .",

It would be expected therefore that coevolutionary analyses will show that cospeciation (vicariant speciation) will be more prevalent in the diversification of the oviparous grade than in the viviparous clade. Further, the basal lineages of the viviparous species should be found on freshwater hosts in South America, while the oviparous gyrodactylids should be restricted to the Neotropics unless, in the unlikely event, dispersal to other regions by their demersal loracariid hosts can be demonstrated.",

The general pattern of distribution and phylogeny resulting from the fragmentation of Pangea and Gondwanaland is not expected to occur. In addition, the freshwater species of each continent are expected to be more closely related to each other than to species of another continent irrespective of host occurrence. However, cases of dispersal between contiguous continents and multiple freshwater invasion of individual land masses may obscure this predicted pattern. In any case, spatial and ecological barriers will likely be more important than phylogenetic distance of host species in explaining extant host-parasite associations.",
