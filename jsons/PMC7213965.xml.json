Among severe COVID-19 patients, the proportion of patients with elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase also seemed higher than the proportion with elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (39.4% vs 28.1%) in the study by Guan et al.2 In another study,3 the absolute levels of aspartate aminotransferase were also higher than alanine aminotransferase (31 vs 24 U/L). Of note, the upper limits of normal for aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were different, which were 40 vs 50 U/L, respectively.3\n",

Guo et al4 indicated that acute cardiac injury can occur in COVID-19 patients, which can be seen in up to 27.8% of patients (52/187). Patients with acute cardiac injury also had significantly higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase than those without cardiac injury (39.5 vs 29.0 U/L; P < .001). However, the difference in alanine aminotransferase did not reach statistical significance between patients with acute cardiac injury and without it (28.5 vs 23.0; P = .11).4 Meanwhile, the heart may occasionally contain a high alanine aminotransferase activity,5 so abnormal levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase might partly result from myocardial injury, especially when increases of aspartate aminotransferase are more prominent.",
