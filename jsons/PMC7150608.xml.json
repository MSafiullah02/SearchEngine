The pneumonia that this coronavirus causes resembles severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). However, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly different from that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [4], and thus, this virus may cause different clinical presentations, including different chest CT findings [5\u20137]. To date, the severity of the illness has been reported to be milder than SARS with a mortality rate ranging from 4.3 [8] to 11% [9]. The incubation time (the time interval between initial contact with an infectious agent and appearance of the first sign or symptom of disease) tends to be longer (median 3 days, range 0\u201324 days) than that of SARS [10, 11]. The imaging findings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [12\u201320] overlap with those of other viral pneumonia [21, 22]. However, COVID-19 might still be classified by some distinguishable features. The longer incubation time and relatively mild symptoms at presentation may allow this disease to more easily spread from humans to humans due to little concern. Prompt screening for the early identification and isolation of the patients are of particular importance. Therefore, chest CT scans might be ideal for this purpose.",

A cohort of 120 consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 1 to February 10, 2020, at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were included. Cases were initially identified by abnormal findings on chest CT scan. And the patients were also diagnosed based on the WHO interim guidance [23]; that is, specimens from the respiratory tract of patients were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing by RT-PCR. The definition of severe type in this study included all severe type and critical ill type diseases defined by the National Guidelines of China [24]. Severe COVID-19 was designated when the patients met one of the following criteria: (1) respiratory distress with a breathing rate \u2265 30/min; (2) pulse oximeter oxygen saturation \u2264 93% at rest; (3) oxygenation index (artery partial pressure of oxygen/inspired oxygen fraction, PaO2/FiO2) \u2264 300 mmHg; (4) respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; (5) shock; and (6) combined with other organ failure requiring intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring and treatment. Patients were then confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia by test of reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from paired nasopharyngeal swabs [10, 25], following the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention of China [26]. We additionally categorized two mild types among the common types: (1) asymptomatic type: patients with no symptoms; and (2) afebrile type: patients have symptoms but a body temperature < 37.3 \u00b0C. Since all patients included in this cohort had positive chest CT findings, we defined them as patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia instead of COVID-19.",

Compared with those of common cases, some CT features were more common in severe cases, such as crazy-paving patterns, bronchiectasis, hilar or mediastinal lymph node enlargement, white lung, air bronchogram, and pleural effusion. We also found that severe cases usually presented as consolidation larger than segmental consolidation, and only severe cases showed an overall lobar or diffuse pneumonia distribution pattern, which indicated that the affected area or volume could also be an important determinant for the disease severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. However, these patterns also often overlap because CT manifestations are dynamic [15, 16], and depend on various factors, such as disease severity, the evolution of the disease course [14, 15, 20], treatment [12], comorbidity, and complications. Usually, as the disease progressed, the range of GGO patches and consolidation increased. Afterwards, condition would improve, GGO and consolidation disappeared, and fibrous stripes (reticulation) may appear [20].",

Thus, quick recognition of the radiological manifestations and a prompt evaluation of the patient\u2019s exposure history is imperative in the early detection and assessment of the severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Numerically, more consolidation and reticulation patterns were found on the CT image of silent and afebrile patients than those of typic patients. This indicated a later detection of mild disease. The transmissibility for these silent cases needs to be further assessed. In addition, during the long incubation period (0\u201324 days, mostly 3 days) [11], patients might also be unwitting vehicles of disease spread.",

The findings of the statistical tests should be interpreted with caution even though our cohort is relatively large. However, the strong associations we found can still can alert physicians to potentially poor prognoses in some cases. The subjectivity of image interpretation may also introduce measurement errors, but these errors were likely to be random. We took a systematic approach that allowed us to obtain valuable statistics and to quantify the imaging changes, thus minimizing the subjectivity. Moreover, we followed a standardize protocol; thus, inter-observer agreement was good for the evaluation of most radiographical abnormalities. As previously described, our cohort may be unique in that the patients admitted were first screened by chest CT, and were admitted from nearby communities to a general hospital rather than a specialized hospital of infectious disease.
