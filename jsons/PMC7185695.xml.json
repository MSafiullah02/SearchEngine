China has the second highest incidence of rabies [8] with an annual 2,000 to 3,000 human deaths, of which more than 95% are due to the bite of a rabid dog [5]. With the two neighboring countries having a high rabies burden, the disease has become endemic and a priority zoonotic disease in Nepal as well [9]. There, the disease has been confirmed in cattle, buffaloes, goats, alpacas, dogs, and mongooses. Rabies occurs throughout the year, and dogs are the principle vector for the transmission of disease. Unfortunately, the true status of rabies burden due to vectors in Nepal is unknown.",

One is the urban cycle which involves domesticated dogs, and the other is the sylvatic cycle which involves wildlife [10]. A study conducted between 1991 and 2000 showed that more than 96% of rabies patients shared a history of rabid dog exposure, indicating that the urban cycle is the main source of human rabies [9]. Large numbers of human rabies cases in Nepal are due to stray and community dogs. Host wise prevalence study also suggests that 61.7% rabies cases were detected in stray and community dogs [11]. Thus, this rabies cycle is maintained by stray and community dogs. Sometimes there is spill-over from stray and community dogs to pet dogs, which further adds to the human rabies burden.",

A vaccination rate of 60\u201370% of pet dogs has been shown to result in a drastic decrease in the prevalence of the disease in humans [12].
