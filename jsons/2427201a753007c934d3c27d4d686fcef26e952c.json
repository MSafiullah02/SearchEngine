The remaining 15 cats had at least one of a complex of inflammatory diseases including pancreatitis, cholangiohepatitis, cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. The most common clinical signs were jaundice, anorexia, lethargy, weight loss and vomiting. Hyperbilirubinaemia was present in all cases. Distension of the common bile duct and gall bladder was the most commonly observed finding on abdominal ultrasound. Nineteen cats underwent exploratory laparotomy for biliary decompression and diversion. Mortality in cats with underlying neoplasia was 100 per cent and, in those with non-neoplastic lesions, was 40 per cent.",

            "text": "In this study, the aetiologies of feline EHBO appeared to fall into two groups: neoplasia of either biliary or pancreatic origin, and inflammatory diseases including pancreatitis, cholangiohepatitis, cholecystitis and cholelithiasis. The pathogenesis of these latter diseases, and their relationship to EHBO, is incompletely understood. An association has been established between cholangiohepatitis, pancreatitis and inflam- (Weiss and others 1996) , and it has been suggested that cholangiohepatitis and pancreatitis may be extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease due to concurrent pancreatic and hepatobiliary reflux (Baez and others 1999) . This theory seems conceivable because of the shared pancreatic and common bile duct anatomy prior to entry into the duodenum in cats (Thune and others 1990) . Inflammatory changes are commonly found in both the pancreatic and common bile ducts of cats at necropsy (Jubb and others 1993) and histological evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was found in one cat in the present study that had a gastrointestinal tract biopsy. The common bile duct passes adjacent to the pancreatic parenchyma before fusing with the pancreatic duct and entering the duodenum (Crouch 1969) . Therefore, pancreatic swelling, oedema or fibrosis can cause obstruction of the common bile duct due to compression. This has been confirmed by cases in this study as well as by others (Martin and others 1986 , Boothe and others 1992 , Fahie and Martin 1995 , Leveille and others 1996 . The relationship between cholangiohepatitis and EHBO is less certain. Obstruction may be causal, coincidental or a consequence of cholangiohepatitis. Among the cases without neoplasia (15 cats), 93 per cent that had liver biopsies had cholangiohepatitis. At least one cat (case 2, Table 3) in this study that underwent necropsy examination had a primary cholangitis with obstruction caused by proliferating mucosa within the common bile duct, suggesting cholangitis to be the sole cause of EHBO in this patient. Another cat (case 8, Table 3 ) with a cholelith lodged in the common bile duct, exhibited severe epithelial hyperplasia with surrounding granulation tissue proximal to the site of obstruction and had evidence of severe suppurative and non-suppurative cholangiohepatitis in the liver. Distal to the obstruction, the common bile duct was normal with no evidence of inflammation, suggesting that, in this case, cholangiohepatitis may have been a consequence of obstruction. Two cats with pancreatic carcinomas also had cholangiohepatitis. The role of obstruction and biliary stasis in the pathogenesis of cholangiohepatitis in these cases is unknown but may be significant. The authors suggest that cholangiohepatitis may be a primary cause of EHBO but it may be more commonly a secondary change that occurs as a result of obstruction. This hypothesis is supported by experimental studies demonstrating the development of cholangiohepatitis after ligation of the common bile duct in cats (Stewart and Lieber 1935, Center and others 1986) .",

Experimental ligation of the common bile duct results in bile sludging and cholelith formation in the canine gallbladder within three days of ligation (Bernhoft and others 1983) . In cats, although bile sludging does occur, prolonged (up to 42 days) experimental ligation of the common bile duct failed to induce cholelith formation (Stewart and Lieber 1935) . Little is known of the lithogenicity of feline bile in health or disease, and cholelith composition has not been extensively investigated in cats. Feline cholelith composition has been reported primarily as cholesterol, calcium and bilirubin, although precise composition analyses have not been reported in most cases (Gibson 1952 , O'Brien and Mitchum 1970 , Naus and Jones 1978 , Hirsch and Doige 1983 , Wolf 1984 , Heidner and Campbell 1985 , Jorgenson and others 1987 . The only cholelith analysed in this study was composed entirely of calcium carbonate. Bile stasis and bacterbilia have been incriminated in biliary lithogenesis (Bernhoft and others 1983, Kirpensteijn and others 1993) , although a causal relationship has not been proven in the cat. In this study, six cats had choleliths detected at surgery or necropsy. Bile cultures were performed in four of these cases, of which three were positive.",

In this study, four of seven cases with cholecystitis had concurrent cholelithiasis. In seven of eight cases where liver and gallbladder were biopsied, concurrent cholecystitis and cholangiohepatitis were found. This suggests that cholecystitis may be part of the same underlying pathological process that induces cholangiohepatitis secondary to EHBO. The role of bacterbilia in the aetiology of cholecystitis is not known in cats. In one report, 81 per cent of dogs with necrotising cholecystitis had positive bile or gallbladder wall cultures (Church and Matthiesen 1988) . Five of seven cats with cholecystitis in this study had bile cultures performed. All five (100 per cent) of these were positive for bacterial growth.",

In the absence of haemolytic or primary hepatic disease, it is generally accepted that an increasing serum bilirubin level over a seven-to 10day period, combined with supportive radiographic or ultrasonographic evidence of obstruction, is an indication for exploratory surgery (Matthiesen 1989 , Center 1996 , Fossum 1997 . Serum ALT, ALP, AST, GGT, amylase and lipase levels are less specific indicators of biliary obstruction (Center 1996) . These findings are supported by the data in this study that show serum bilirubin levels elevated in 100 per cent of cases, while serum ALT and ALP levels were elevated in 77 per cent and 81 per cent of cats, respectively. It was also noted that the increases in ALT and ALP were smaller and less consistent over time, compared to reference ranges, than those for total bilirubin. Although 100 per cent of the cats had elevated AST and GGT in this study, the specificity of these enzymes for EHBO is unknown. Serum cholesterol assay did not appear to aid diagnosis of EHBO as 95 per cent of the cats had normal levels; in contrast, hypercholesterolaemia is a common finding in dogs with EHBO (Center 1996) . Biochemical abnormalities must never be interpreted in isolation. It is known that acute pancreatitis can cause a temporary, potentially reversible, bile duct occlusion in cats (Fossum 1997) . This demonstrates the importance of obtaining radiographic or ultrasonographic evidence of an obstructive process that could potentially be surgically palliated by biliary decompression or diversion.",

Evidence of gallbladder distension, and a dilated and tortuous common bile duct or hepatic ducts is suggestive of obstruction, although ultrasound examination cannot always confirm current obstruction without induction of gallbladder emptying with either a fatty meal or cholecystokinin (Smith and others 1998) . Others have found the diameter of the common bile duct to be less than 4 mm in normal cats, and at least 5 mm in most cats with EHBO (Leveille and others 1996) . In contrast, after prolonged distension of the common bile duct in dogs, loss of elasticity of the duct can result in permanent distension, although the gallbladder enlargement usually resolves (Raptopoulos and others 1985) . Gallbladder wall thickening was subjectively observed in 61 per cent of cats in this study. Wall thickening is a non-specific sign of EHBO in cats (Hittmair and others 2001) .

It is hypoth-esised that the absence of bile salts in the intestinal tract leads to bacterial overgrowth and endotoxin absorption (Bailey 1976) . Impaired clearance of endotoxins due to reduced reticuloendothelial function in the liver (Wen Ding and others 1994) leads to peripheral endotoxaemia (Bailey 1976) . Endotoxin is a potent renal vasoconstrictor that is capable of causing acute tubular necrosis (Wardle 1970) . Gastrointestinal bleeding may occur due to endotoxin-mediated gastric ischaemia and increased acid secretion (Dixon and others 1984) . Decreased fibroplasia and angiogenesis, causing delayed healing in abdominal wounds of jaundiced patients has been shown, but is not consistently seen in clinical cases of EHBO (Bayer and Ellis 1976) . Hypotension and decreased myocardial contractility has been demonstrated, although the mechanism remains unclear (Alon and others 1982, Green and others 1986) . As many postoperative complications of EHBO appear to be endotoxin-related, therapeutic intervention to prevent endotoxaemia may be of benefit. Bile salt supplementation, administration of polymixin B, cimetidine, lactulose and bowel irrigation have all been shown to prevent endotoxaemia (Pain and others 1985) and may have been beneficial to cats in this study.",

It should be noted that the prevalence of cholangiohepatitis, cholecystitis and pancreatitis occurring with EHBO may have been overestimated in this study due to the likelihood that surgical biopsies were taken from grossly abnormal organs which are therefore more likely to have histopathological change. Small case numbers preclude the identification of specific risk factors for perioperative complications in feline EHBO surgery. Furthermore, the effect of chronicity of disease (mean time from onset of clinical signs to presentation was 20 days) on outcome is unknown.",

In this group of cats, it was most often associated with malignant neoplasia or a complex of inflammatory diseases including pancreatitis, cholangiohepatitis, cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. These cats had persistent hyperbilirubinaemia and ultrasonographic evidence of obstruction, and these parameters were used as indications for exploratory laparotomy and biliary decompression. Based on this clinical experience, the prognosis for cats undergoing laparotomy should be considered guarded; perioperative morbidity and mortality is high. The majority of cats in this study had a prolonged disease course, and it is possible that surgical intervention early in the course of disease may improve results. Long-term complications seen after biliary decompression include recurrent cholangiohepatitis, chronic weight loss and recurrence of obstruction.",
