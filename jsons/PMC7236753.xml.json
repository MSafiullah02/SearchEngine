            "text": "Retailers frequently rely on suppliers that are prone to disruptions. In this setting, the retailers face the common problem to adjust their pricing and ordering decisions in response to the prevailing supply uncertainty. This is particularly relevant when multiple suppliers offer competing substitute goods when the wholesale price needs to be decided. This research deals with one specific aspect of this decision-making environment, posing the following research question: how retailers should account for the timing of disruptions at the competing suppliers of substitutable products when making pricing and ordering decisions?",

            "text": "Our main analysis is based on three stylized facts, which we motivate in the following. First, despite the complexity of supply chains (SCs), one can distinguish a dyadic supplier-retailer structure as one of the most common ones in the analysis. There is a growing body of research that studies the impact of a supply disruption to pricing and ordering at retailers [e.g.; [3], [9], [11], [15], [20], [26], [51], [67]], specifically in supply chains for beverages, fresh produce, etc. Severe disruptions typically result in supply shortages at the retailer for the disrupted product and retailers employ demand management (such as pricing) and supply management (e.g., placing emergency orders or managing inventory) strategies to mitigate this temporary disruption [19], [27], [29], [36], [38], [41], [42], [43], [46], [58]. For instance, retailers sourcing fresh produce, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, in large quantities from multiple competing suppliers may face supply loss due to crop failures or food contamination. Recently, there was a case of supply disruption of romaine lettuce to retailers and restaurants due to contamination with Shiga-toxin producing E. coli bacteria [47]. A food-safety recall was issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [6]. This recall led to an increase in the demand and prices of other lettuce produce, and the price of iceberg lettuce increased from $36 before the supply disruption to around $60 (each carton) after the disruption. In addition, several retailers and restaurants such as Panera Bread [40] managed their lettuce supply by intermittently ordering from the suppliers which were not part of the CDC recall notice. During that time, romaine lettuce was still available for sale, however, the product sales were reduced by about 38 percent (total $7.5 million) in the week ending on November 24, 2018, as compared to the week before that. In conclusion, the supply disruption of romaine lettuce led to an increase in the price and demand of other (substitute) lettuce produce. This disruption also led to a decrease in the sales of (in-stock/ on-shelf) romaine lettuce at the retailers.",

In particular, we explain the role of product substitution in pricing and sourcing strategies of competing suppliers who work with a common retailer. Considering different constellations of ordering decisions and disruption timing, we propose a method to analyze the existing pricing-ordering policies in the disrupted supply cases and to derive the optimal ones. Factoring the timing of disruption in pricing has a clear practical motivation. Knowing whether a disruption takes place between two orders or after both orders can help a retailer because they can control the pricing decisions when disruption happens. Finally, we include disruption severity and price leadership in our analysis and uncover equilibrium pricing strategies.",

            "text": "Second, the supplier-retailer pricing decisions may not always entail direct competition between products, however, the suppliers of substitutable products are more likely to compete based on prices when there is supply disruption. Thus, supply shortages for food and beverage products, usually short-term, can lead to an increase in retail prices, procurement costs, and the demand for substitute products from alternate suppliers. Besides food and beverage businesses, other businesses resort to managing demand, when facing supply disruption, by offering available substitute products to their customers. For example, facing supply disruption of silicone, a material used to manufacture tires through vulcanization, a company called Ace Products and Consulting LLC used devulcanized silicone as a substitute of silicone [5]. Their CEO, Erick Sharp, stated in 2018: \u201cIf we can offset 10 percent of it (silicone demand), anything helps at this point, especially when you\u2019re trying to equal the price back out.\u201d In this paper, we focus on competitive pricing as a demand management tool that can be used to match supply and demand for substitute products in the event of short-term supply shortages.",

An important determinant in the reliable/unreliable sourcing literature is the information available about the disruption, and, more specifically, the availability of information to some players and the non-availability of this information to other players. [21], [49], [59], [60], [61], and [68] assume a lack of visibility regarding the disruption risk of a supplier and study different scenarios of information availability/unavailability among the players.

The area of supply disruption risk mitigation and recovery is mainly shaped by problems of reliable/unreliable and primary/backup suppliers [[23], [28], [33], [36], [50], [54], [61], [63], [64], to name a few]. Most studies consider how changes to some operational parameters (e.g., capacity disruptions) impact sourcing and customer performance. There is a strong and growing literature in the given area, with methodologies grounded in the newsboy problem extensions and game theory. Typically, a two-stage sourcing system is considered where a single product can be sourced from both unreliable (less expensive) and reliable (more expensive) suppliers [12], [50]. In this problem domain, competition, pricing, and contracting issues have been the research focus [for e.g., [4], [66]], resolving the trade-off between supply reliability vs costs. While studies have established the salience of optimal pricing and ordering policies in single product cases, including supplier portfolio diversification, little attention has been directed to substitutable products sold by competing suppliers.",

At the same time, new practical cases motivate researchers to extend existing modeling frameworks. In particular, the issues of product substitution in the case of disruption can be considered as an interesting research avenue. Even if the power imbalance with substituable products was studied in literature [for e.g., 17], the inclusion of product substitution effects on the pricing and ordering decisions under supply disruption was considered only in a few recent papers [7], [37], [51]. Our literature analysis provides evidence that supply disruptions may lead to price fluctuations due to supply shortages. For example, the devastating shortage of flu vaccinations that occurred in the US in 2004, which was caused by bacterial pollution, led to an increase in the vaccination price from $60 to $800 [64]. The earthquake in Japan also resulted in the increasing prices for products affected by the natural disaster [18], [34]. While natural disasters may cause supply interruption and the resulting price fluctuations, in other settings, the opposite effect can be observed when the price increases cause supply interruptions. For example, French discounter E. Leclerc had refused to accept Coca-Cola\u2019s price increases request in 2018 which left several stores without the product for several weeks [39]. Leclerc had to allegedly contact another source to acquire the popular drinks.",

The resulting supply shortage was partially mitigated at most retailers by sourcing the product from a competing supplier. This spurred our initial motivation to extend the existing body of knowledge with regards to product substitution issues. Such questions have arisen as pricing strategy sensitivity to disruption among competitors at one supplier, or the impact of disruption on retailer\u2019s ordering behavior and the price policy of non-disrupted suppliers who know about their competitor\u2019s disruptions has become more apparent. Should non-disrupted suppliers charge a higher (or lower) wholesale price to capitalize on the lost supply? Does a retailer always loses money because of a potential loss in supply and a potential increase in the wholesale prices? The literature is scarce in answering these significant questions, specifically, the effects of disruption timing, the sequence of ordering decisions by suppliers and bi-directional product substitution.",

Meanwhile, the literature highlights the importance of sourcing re-configuration as an important dimension to withstand the disruptions and adapt [2], [8], [35], [50]. None of these studies, though, have formally and rigorously quantified the optimal pricing and ordering configuration by adapting the sourcing decisions. Moreover, the impact of supply disruption timing has not been explicitly specified. In contrast to these studies, we do not consider the demand switching effect, but the supply switching perspective of product substitution, bi-directionally substitutable products, and incomplete information about supply disruptions. Such a perspective appears to be more relevant in a practical decision environment, relative to inherent problems in adapting the pricing and ordering decisions on the changes in the supplier base [9], [25], [34], [56].",

We hypothesize that the timing of disruption may significantly impact the optimal pricing and ordering decisions at the retailer.

Their findings highlight how costs, capacity (limited or unlimited), and volume flexibility affect the optimal selection of contingency policies, such as risk mitigation inventory and capacity flexibility. [44] explores a supply chain system with one retailer, a manufacturer, and an unreliable supplier under the extended newsboy problem setting. The author shows the existence of a Nash equilibrium under the competitive pricing game setting. He also reveals that in a Stackelberg game led by the manufacturer, the retailer is expected to earn a higher profit when excess demand is backordered. Note that a similar scenario with a two-product system is studied by [53]. [8] extend [50] and [12] who investigate a periodic-review inventory system with stochastic demand and limited backup supplier capacity. [25] show that supply reliability thresholds play a critical role in buyer procurement strategy choices. [2] find that a manufacturer\u2019s optimal sourcing strategy depends on the degree of overlap of suppliers in the supply network.",

[37] study a common single period system where two substitute products can be sourced from a reliable and expensive supplier or an unreliable and cheaper supplier. The products in their study are downward substitutable (i.e., only higher-grade products can substitute for lower- grade ones). The author proves that product substitution increases the expected marginal benefit of dual sourcing for the higher-grade product. Different from [37], we consider bi-directionally substitutable products. [7] study a system with two competing manufacturers and a common retailer. The authors formulate a newsboy problem-based model to determine the optimal price and quantity and study the non-cooperative games in the supply chain.",

In fact, it can be treated as an extension of various prior studies by investigating the impacts of product substitution on supplier disruption risk mitigation in the following problem setting:1.The system consists of one retailer and two suppliers, and the retailer aims to maximize its profits by adjusting pricing policies. Product substitution (between two products supplied by the respective suppliers) is considered whereby products are bi-directionally substitutable. Different timing in relation to the ordering decisions and disruption in the supply chain is examined. Price leadership in the supply chain is considered.2.The linear price-dependent demand function is applied, which has been widely used in the OM literature, such as [14], [1], [45], [24], and [34].3.Supply disruptions risk can be modeled using different modeling approaches including random yield, all-or-nothing supply, and stochastic capacity. In this paper, for analytical tractability as well as fitness to our scope, we use the random yield modeling approach [9], [13], [62] in our study, i.e., in this model, the quantity received by a buyer is a random fraction of the quantity ordered from the disrupted supplier.\n",

This price decrease is driven by competition between the suppliers to sell to their common retailer. In order to induce demand for a product with higher elasticity, the market price must be lowered, which results in lower retail prices. Consequently, the upstream wholesale price must also go down for the same product. However, due to price competition between the suppliers, the other supplier must reduce the wholesale price of its own product as well to compete. In the Nash game, a supplier can set a higher wholesale price than its competitor if the supplier has a larger customer base (\u03b1i), a lower cost ci or customer\u2019s are less sensitive to it\u2019s price (an indication of product loyalty) \u03b2i as compared to the same parameters for the competing supplier.

In the Nash game, there is a higher competition between suppliers A and B as compared to the Stackelberg gaming cases when A or B leads the SC. A higher degree of competition between the suppliers leads to lower wholesale prices and consequently lower retail prices. This result is presented below as Theorem 1.i). Interestingly, we note that lower prices do not always result in larger order quantities, and only the follower in the SC receives a larger order quantity as compared to the order quantity in the Nash game as outlined in Theorem 1.ii). This occurs because a price decrease or an increase by the leading supplier can be easily followed by the other supplier by a price reduction or an increment, respectively. Hence the second mover gains an advantage by being able to respond to the price of the competing supplier; this observation is in confirmation with the economics literature on price competition e.g.; [16]. Theorem 1.iii) observes that the retailer benefits from a higher competition (Nash) between A and B and earns a higher profit. Theorem 1.iv) indicates that the follower in the Stackelberg game always earns a higher profit as compared to its profit in the Nash game, as it receives a larger order quantity and sells at a higher wholesale price as compared to the Nash alternative. This result is interesting, as in a typical Stackelberg game, the leader of the SC is known to have the first-mover advantage, but our result shows the other way round. Theorem 1.v) presents the upper bound on the increase in profit of supplier A as the Stackelberg leader of the pricing game. Both suppliers set a higher wholesale price and earn a higher profit as compared to the profit, while only B receives a larger order as compared to the order quantity under the Nash game. A is able to earn a higher profit with a smaller order size by increasing wA but there is an upper bound on the increase in profit given by 9/8 or an increase of 12.5%.Theorem 1\ni) The equilibrium wholesale and retail product prices for the Stackelberg game are higher than the corresponding wholesale and retail prices for the Nash game:\n{wi,sAe,wi,sBe}>wi,ne\nand\n{pi,sAe,pi,sBe}>pi,ne\nfor\ni=1,2\n. ii) The equilibrium order quantity for the product ordered first is lower, i.e.,\nq1,sAe<q1,ne<q1,sBe,\nwhereas order quantity for the product ordered second is higher\nq2,sAe>q2,ne>q2,sBe\nthan the corresponding order quantities in Nash equilibrium. iii) The retailer\u2019s profit is higher when orders are placed simultaneously than when the orders are placed separately, i.e.,\n\u03a0sR,e<\u03a0nR,e\n. iv) Comparing the profits under the Nash equilibrium, supplier B earns a higher profit as a follower of supplier A, i.e.,\n\u03a0sAB,e>\u03a0nB,e\n. v) Supplier A, as the leader, always earns a higher profit under the Stackelberg game with an upper bound of\n1<\u03a0sAA,e/\u03a0nA,e\u22649/8\n.\n\n",

For the first stage, the regular wholesale prices (w1,ne,w2,ne) and the order quantities (q1,ne,q2,ne) are identical to the equilibrium wholesale prices as given by (3) and the order quantities in benchmark case a), respectively. This is because the supply disruption occurs after all these decisions are realized in stage 1. We need to derive the equilibrium emergency order quantity qE, the corresponding wholesale price wE, and the equilibrium retail prices (p\n1, p\n2). Using the backward induction method, we solve the last stage first and derive the optimal centralized prices for R, given the regular wholesale prices (w1,w2)=(w1,ne,w2,ne) and the supply constraint on A: q1=\u03b4q1,ne,\u03b4\u2208[0,1). The quantity of product 1 received by R is given by \u03b4q1,ne. Since market prices are set to be market clearing, we have: \u03b4q1,ne=D1(p1,p2)=\u03b11\u2212\u03b21p1+p2. Therefore, the objective function for retailer R is given by:max(p1,p2)(p1\u2212w1)\u03b4q1,ne+p2(\u03b12+p1\u2212\u03b22p2)\u2212w2,neq2,ne\u2212wE(\u03b12+p1\u2212\u03b22p2\u2212q2,ne).Due to the additional constraint \u03b4q1,ne=\u03b11\u2212\u03b21p1+p2, the objective function for R can be reduced to only one variable p\n1 as:(10)maxp1(p1\u2212w1)\u03b4q1,ne+(\u03b4q1,ne\u2212\u03b11+\u03b21p1)(\u03b12+p1\u2212\u03b22(\u03b4q1,ne\u2212\u03b11+\u03b21p1))\u2212w2,neq2,ne\u2212wE(\u03b12+p1\u2212\u03b22(\u03b4q1,ne\u2212\u03b11+\u03b21p1)\u2212q2,ne).It is easy to see from the second order condition that the retailer\u2019s objective function is concave in p\n1 (and p\n2), and thus we obtain the unique maximizer directly from the first order condition:(11)p1,n*(wE,n)=\u03b11+\u03b12\u03b212\u03b21(\u03b21\u03b22\u22121)+2(\u03b11\u2212\u03b4q1,ne)+wE,n2\u03b21,andp2,n*(wE,n)=\u03b11+\u03b12\u03b212(\u03b21\u03b22\u22121)+wE,n2.Using the centralized prices in (11), we solve the equilibrium wholesale price decision by B in the second stage. Supplier B\u2019s objective for the emergency order is: maxwE(wE\u2212c2)qE(wE)=maxwE(wE\u2212c2)(\u03b12+p1*(wE)\u2212\u03b22p2*(wE)\u2212q2,ne), as qE(wE)=\u03b12+p1,n*(wE)\u2212\u03b22p2,n*(wE)\u2212q2,ne. From the first order condition, we obtain:(12)wE,ne=\u03b11+\u03b12\u03b21\u22122\u03b4q1,ne\u22122\u03b21q2,ne2(\u03b21\u03b22\u22121)+c22.Note that the order quantities (q1,ne,q2,ne) are those derived in the benchmark case in Subsection 3.1.

As a result of this additional order, R\u00e2s objective function while setting the retail prices is identical to (10), and thereby, the centralized prices (p1*(wE),p2*(wE)) have expressions identical to (11). Therefore,(14)p1*(wE,sA)=\u03b11+\u03b12\u03b212\u03b21(\u03b21\u03b22\u22121)+2(\u03b11\u2212\u03b4q1,sAe)+wE,sA2\u03b21,andp2*(wE,sA)=\u03b11+\u03b12\u03b212(\u03b21\u03b22\u22121)+wE,sA2.Note that (11) and (14) are algebraically similar except for the order quantity before disruption and the emergency order quantity.

Thus, A leads the SC, and since B has not yet received an order, R places a single emergency order to B. As in the benchmark case b) where supplier A leads, in the first stage, A charges the same wholesale price, as presented in (6). R orders the corresponding quantity of product 1 (q1e) as in Section 3.2 but receives only \u03b4q1,sAe because of the supply disruption. We obtain the equilibrium wholesale price wE charged by B for the emergency order. The retail prices are obtained using the backward-induction method.

Specifically, Lemma 4 notes that supplier A charges a higher equilibrium emergency wholesale price than what it will charge in the corresponding Nash game, but only for low levels of disruption when A leads the SC. However, when B leads the SC, the equilibrium emergency wholesale price is always higher than the corresponding price that will be charged in the Nash game. This result is surprising: the equilibrium wholesale prices charged by A and B are both higher than their Nash gaming counterparts in the Stackelberg games for the benchmark cases, as shown in Theorem 1.i). Therefore, intuitively the emergency wholesale prices must also be higher than the Nash game counterpart. However, this occurs only when B leads the SC. This result is driven by Theorem 1.ii) which posits that the quantity ordered to supplier A is lower when A leads the SC than when B leads the SC. Consequently, if there is a low level of disruption, then the supply R loses from A is not high, and B can charge a higher emergency wholesale price for the smaller quantity of product 2 ordered by R. However, when B leads the SC, the impact of disruption is high. This is because the quantity (q1,sBe) ordered with supplier A is higher compared to the quantity ordered in the corresponding Nash game, (q1,ne), resulting in a higher emergency wholesale price.Lemma 5\nUnder disruption, the equilibrium emergency order price before both suppliers receive orders is higher compared to the emergency order price after both suppliers receive orders, i.e.,\nwEe>{wE,ne,wE,sAe,wE,sBe}\n.

This result is derived from Lemma 4, presented below as Theorem 2, and captures the role of the timing of the disruption and ordering in determining wholesale prices. Generally, compared to the Stackelberg game, the Nash game leads to lower wholesale prices in the market because of the greater level of competition between the suppliers. In Theorem 1.i), we have already observed this well-known phenomenon in the benchmark cases.Theorem 2\nWhen disruption is more serious (\u03b4 is low), the equilibrium emergency order\u2019s wholesale price when A leads the SC is lower compared to the emergency order\u2019s wholesale price in the corresponding Nash game, i.e.,\nwE,sAe<wE,ne\nif\n\u03b4\u2208[0,\u03b21\u03b222\u03b21\u03b22\u22121)\n.\n\n",

Observe from Lemma 4 that this order relationship between the wholesale prices does not hold when the supply disruption is not too serious (i.e., \u03b4\u2208[\u03b21\u03b222\u03b21\u03b22\u22121),1). The reason for this interesting observation can be explained using Theorem 1.ii). We know that, in the Nash game, the equilibrium order quantity q2,ne (q1,ne) is lower (higher) compared to the order quantity q2,sAe (q1,sAe) in the Stackelberg game. When the level of disruption is high (\u03b4 is low) and q1e is high, A fulfills a much smaller quantity of the original order for product 1. Consequently, R would place a larger order to B for product 2 and thus, B charges a higher emergency price in the Nash game since q1,ne>q1,sAe. This effect is further pronounced by the fact that the initial order q2,ne<q2,sAe is lower in the Nash game where both suppliers lack price leadership. Overall, the theorem provides insights into the influence of the sequence of ordering and disruption on the pricing behavior of the emergency supplier. Thus, when a retailer is working with a supplier facing disruption, it is better to order first with them only when the disruption is serious to secure a better emergency order wholesale contract price.Proposition 2\nThe equilibrium emergency order\u2019s wholesale price and the equilibrium retail prices decrease as the level of disruption decreases.\n\n",

This helps us to express the expected profits for A and B, respectively as:(20)E[\u03a0A](w1,n)=(w1,n\u2212c1)[\u03b8(\u03b4q1,ne)+(1\u2212\u03b8)q1,ne]=(w1,n\u2212c1)q1,ne[1\u2212\u03b8(1\u2212\u03b4)],E[\u03a0B](w2,n)=(w2,n\u2212c2)[\u03b8(q2,ne)+(1\u2212\u03b8)q2,ne]=(w2,n\u2212c2)q2,ne.From the profit expression of A above, in (20) we note the similarity with Case 3.1; as the profit shrinks by [1\u2212\u03b8(1\u2212\u03b4)] due to disruption. Consequently, the equilibrium wholesale prices (and order quantities) observed in the corresponding benchmark case continue to hold, i.e., we have identical wholesale and retail prices wi,n\u03b8,e=wi,ne,\npi,n\u03b8,e=pi,ne, and order quantities qi,n\u03b8,e=qi,ne as presented in (3).",

Due to disruption, A delivers a quantity \u03b4q1,n\u03b8,e and B delivers q2,n\u03b8,e+qE,n\u03b8,\u03b4. Using the backward induction method, we derive the optimal centralized prices for R. The objective function for retailer R is:max(p1,p2)(p1\u2212w1\u03b8,e)\u03b4q1,n\u03b8,e+p2(\u03b12+p1\u2212\u03b22p2)\u2212w2,n\u03b8,eq2,n\u03b8,e\u2212wE\u03b8,\u03b4(\u03b12+p1\u2212\u03b22p2\u2212q2,n\u03b8,e).Due to the additional constraint \u03b4q1,n\u03b8,e=\u03b11\u2212\u03b21p1+p2, the objective function can be reduced to only one variable p\n1 which makes the objective identical to (10) and thus the unique maximizer satisfies (11). Supplier B\u2019s decision for the emergency wholesale price is identical to (12). Note again that the order quantities (q1,n\u03b8,e,q2,n\u03b8,e) are identical to those derived in Subsection 3.1, therefore, we can derive the retail prices in closed form as:(21)p1,n\u03b4,e=\u03b11+\u03b12\u03b212\u03b21(\u03b21\u03b22\u22121)+2(\u03b11\u2212\u03b4q1,ne)+wE,ne2\u03b21=3(\u03b11+\u03b12\u03b21)\u22122\u03b4q1,ne\u22122\u03b21q2,ne4\u03b21(\u03b21\u03b22\u22121)+\u03b11\u2212\u03b4q1,ne\u03b21+c24\u03b21,p2,n\u03b4,e=\u03b11+\u03b12\u03b212(\u03b21\u03b22\u22121)+wE,ne2=\u03b11+\u03b12\u03b212(\u03b21\u03b22\u22121)+\u03b11+\u03b12\u03b21\u22122\u03b4q1,ne\u22122\u03b21q2,ne4(\u03b21\u03b22\u22121)+c24=3(\u03b11+\u03b12\u03b21)\u22122\u03b4q1,ne\u22122\u03b21q2,ne4(\u03b21\u03b22\u22121)+c24.This completes the analysis for Case 1 with the additional parameter \u03b8. We note that the analysis is almost identical to that in Section 4.1 except that the profit expression for A changes by a fraction [1\u2212\u03b8(1\u2212\u03b4)]. Analysis for Case 2 and Case 3 will be similar by including \u03b8.",

Therefore, by definition this scenario precludes the case with the Nash game between A and B. We only consider the case when A leads the SC by setting the wholesale price for product 1, R ordering from A and afterwards there are two possibilities: disruption occurs immediately or occurs after R places an order with B. These two scenarios are presented as Cases 3 and 2, respectively in Figure 3. The ordering and pricing decisions that take place after the uncertainty about the disruption is resolved are identical to the decisions in the deterministic cases presented in Section 4, and the only difference arises for the two decisions that always occur before disruption which is the wholesale price set by A and the corresponding order quantity by R. It is easy to see that the quantity delivered by A in both cases is the same, i.e., a fraction \u03b4 of the original order quantity. The objective function of retailer A does not depend on the probabilities for disruption timing and the results from Section 4 will continue to hold. This result is expected and consistent with the analysis with disruption timing.",

First, a non-disrupted supplier can benefit from a disruption at the competitor especially in case of promotion actions. The non-disrupted supplier can quickly arrange a promotion action with the retailer. On the contrary, the organization of future promotion actions would be problematic for the disrupted supplier since this might be too risky for the retailer. Any disruption during the promotional period has a very high impact on the retailers. Second, reductions in sales impact both the suppliers and retailers. A disruption weakens the negotiation positions of the supplier to increase purchasing prices in the future since the retailer can refer to lost sales and low delivery performance in the past.

Despite the possibility of generalizing the results, the model applied herein is limited in some ways. First, the demand function is deterministic. Even if the usage of such a function can be justified by other studies in the area, this is certainly a restriction in the application of the model to cases with stochastic demand. Second, we assumed full information availability in this study. This can be justified by the fact that serious disruptions usually become quickly known in markets with few competitors, as in the situational context of our cases. At the same time, there are certainly other problem settings for which a lack of visibility in the SC must be considered. The third limitation is a restriction of our results to some specific products for which operative changes in prices are possible. In practice, this holds true for products which are purchased on a tender basis, e.g., imported fruits and vegetables, regional meat and poultry, or fish. Finally, an important factor which is not explicitly included in our model is the ordering/delivery frequency. In case of frequent deliveries (2-3 times per week), one plausible application of our findings is the price adjustments by a retailer for the next price negotiation cycle, and not for the next order. The distribution of order timings in relation to the disruption can be considered in regards to the most critical orders, for instance, for products that are under promotion by the retailer to stimulate demand.",
