In Portugal, regulatory rules have determined that only -urgent\u2016 care should be provided for the duration of the pandemic-leaving each physical therapist with the discretionary power to determine which cases could benefit the most from their intervention. Although many may recognize the benefit of physical therapy in the face of this infection, 1 many cases may fall into a gray area, resulting in asymmetrical accessibility to care.",

First, wearing disposable personal protection equipment, which should be changed between patients, can reduce transmission of the infection; second, decreasing the number of patients and therapists in the same physical space may facilitate social distancing; and third, digital physical therapist practice, making use of technology for communicating with and guiding patients, is proposed by some international agencies. 3 These methods, however, have a steep learning curve not suited for an immediate-need context, and many older patients may have limitations using new technologies. Involving family and caregivers in the treatment session may reduce this hindrance and promote participation, particularly in patients with neuropsychiatric conditions and in pediatric patients. This strategy would require legal regulation to prevent uncertified individuals from offering health care services, even if in a virtual setting, without the appropriate accreditation and certification of expertise.",
