Although the goldstandard of consultation involves in-person evaluation of the patient, it is clear that this crisis calls for the use of technology to decrease viral transmission. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the use of telemedicine when possible, limits on the number of staff providing care to COVID-19+ patients, and use of dedicated healthcare providers who care only for COVID+ patients during a shift. 1 It would be simple to reflexively respond to this challenge by insisting that our service, in its fully staffed form, is an indispensable entity in the hospital. After all, we care for extraordinarily sick patients, we rely on physical exam findings including a thorough neurological exam, and we manage conditions, such as hyperactive delirium, catatonia and severe alcohol withdrawal, which require frequent visual assessments.",

Workforce preservation becomes essential to not only maintain a healthy number of clinicians, but to ensure psychological health. We must protect our greatest resource, each other.",

One of the most challenging skills for trainees to master is determining the extent of involvement required for a specific consult. Trainees must learn to be thorough, avoid premature closure, and resist tunnel-vision focused on the specific consult question. They must recognize that not every consultation requires a soup-to-nuts evaluation, understanding the value in a brief, focused assessment. A hybrid approach to patient care on the C-L service, with some evaluations completed by chart review, telephone encounter or video, creates an opportunity for trainees to learn valuable lessons about triage.",

Never has the C-L psychiatry role been so important to support and hold the therapeutic container for the caregivers of medicine.
