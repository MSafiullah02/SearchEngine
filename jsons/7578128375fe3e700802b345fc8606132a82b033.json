I identify a logarithmic relationship between the cumulative death rate in a state and its cumulative positive share of tests. Using this relationship, I find that 4.3-5.4 million people, 1.4-1.7% of the U.S. population, were infected, with rates of infection that ranged from 0.1% in more rural states to 8-10% in New York state and 11-13% in New York City. Only 16-20% of these infected individuals were identified later through testing.",

I use this relationship to estimate the identified and unidentified shares of the total cases in the states on April 25th, which in total provides a national estimate of the infected population in the U.S. in mid-April. I validate the methodology by examining whether the estimate of the unidentified share of cases in a state is consistent with its reported testing strategy and the availability of testing in March and early April. Since the states did not test asymptomatic individuals, I also examine whether the estimated shares of unidentified cases are consistent with an estimate of the asymptomatic share of all cases in a screening study carried out in Iceland.",

This yields a 2.3% death rate for all cases. This rate could be low if some deaths related to the cases are yet to occur or are not included in the statistics, but this is unlikely. The data in the table show that in the two days prior to April 20 th there were only 21 new cases and two new deaths. These numbers are so small that slight increases would have no noticeable effect on the ratio of cumulative deaths/cumulative cases in mid-April. In addition, deaths are unlikely to be underestimated because South Korea tested all suspected cases and attributed all deaths of persons who tested positive for the coronavirus to the virus, even if they had other underlying health conditions [AFP-JiJi, 2020].",

The higher reported incidence in the U.S. is due, at least in part, to the failure to test individuals who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, a category where younger individuals are more prevalent. Taking this characteristic into account, the age distributions of infected individuals do not seem very different in the two countries, so I conclude the South Korean death rate of 2.3% is applicable for the actual death rate in the U.S. when all cases of COVID-19 are included.",

Figure 1 shows the share of cumulative positive tests by state for the lower-48 states and South Korea on April 7 th , using U.S. data published in Politico [Jin, 2020] . These data show that about half the states had shares of positive tests under 10%, with the lowest share at 3%. All of the states had a higher share of cumulative positive tests than South Korea (2%). Five states had shares of cumulative positive tests over 20%, and three states had shares over 30%. These three states, New Jersey, New York, and Michigan, reported tremendous limitations on their capacity to test individuals with COVID-19 symptoms. Maag [2020] reports that in late March 2020 very sick New Jersey residents spent many nights in their cars waiting in line at testing stations, after being turned away in emergency rooms. In late March New York City restricted testing to hospitalized patients to prevent the many infected individuals with less serious symptoms from leaving home [Cuzey, 2020] . Michigan restricted testing to those with the most serious symptoms until testing was extended to those with mild symptoms in mid-April [Clarke, 2020] .",
