Each country is represented with a number according to the data numbering in John Hopkins University Repository. For visual clarity, the names of some countries or areas are shown on the map. Figure 2 shows the topological maps for patients spread up to February 20 2020, the early stage when COVID-19 patients were detected outside China. From this map, it can be observed that many countries occupy the upper left area on the map. The overlapping are due to the similar dynamics in the COVID-19 cases among many countries, in that most of them have identified very few patients at this time. At this time, Hubei, the epicenter for outbreak, was already an outlier on the map, as the number of patients in Hubei was in different magnitude compared to other areas. It can be also observed here that USA, France, South Korea, and Asian countries as Malaysia, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Hong Kong were positioned adjacently, due to their similar dynamics, while many China's provinces as Zhejiang, Shanghai, Liaoning and naturally Hubei were outliers due to their early outbreaks. Figure 3 shows the map up to March 6. The upper left of the map was still crowded, but many countries can be seen to breakout from this overlapping area. This is due to many countries were beginning to develop different strategies resulting in different patients transmission dynamics. It is notable that Italy and Iran moved considerably from the crowded cluster due to the beginning of outbreaks in these two countries, while USA still shared the space, and thus has similar dynamics with Macau and Taiwan. Figure 4 shows the map up to March 25, two weeks after World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The left corner became less crowded as more and more countries developed their unique spread dynamics. Noticeably, South Korea moved away, due to rapid surge of virus transmissions in this period. Outbreaks occurred in USA, Spain and Italy as reflected by topographical encoder decoder patients time series patients time series Korea kept their unique positions on the map because of their unique dynamics that saw early outbreak but than stabilized. Figure 5 shows the map up to March 30, that did not significantly change from the previous map. This is because no noticeable new outbreaks, and hence many countries have stabilized their policies that results in the stabilization of their spread dynamics. The noticeable change is the split of Germany and Spain that previously shared a same dynamics.",

From the left area, as shown in Fig.  6a , Beijing, Zhejiang and Vatican had dissimilar dynamics that were reflected by their large distances on the map. Beijing and Zhejiang have both contained the outbreaks but had different dynamics and cumulative patient numbers, while Vatican had very few patients up to March 30. In the middle of the map Japan, Netherlands and Switzerland can be observed each with considerably different dy-namics as shown in Fig. 6b . From the right side of the map, Hubei, USA and Italy as shown in Fig. 6c . It is obvious that Hubei had stabilized while patients numbers were growing steeply in USA and Italy.

Figure  7a shows the representation for Beijing's, Zhejiang's and Vatican's dynamics, Fig. 7b shows the representation for Japan's, Netherlands' and Switzerland's dynamics, while Fig. 6c shows those of Hubei, USA and Italy. Here, it is important to notice that TA represents different dynamics with different internal representations that are important to recreate the original dynamics in the output layer of TA.

The initial experiments indicate that we can gain intuitive insights on the similarities and differences in the disease transmission among many countries. By visualizing the maps in time, we can also learn the shifts in each countries situations, which mirror their strategies. At this moment, this topological map is not directly useful for evaluating the efficiency of strategies executed by many countries to mitigate the crisis. However, the author believes that the intuitive visual understanding gained from these topological maps will be useful in comparing strategies among many countries, and thus for designing optimal strategies for mitigating this crisis. The direct usage of this map, is to cluster countries having similar dynamics, and train a time series predictor, for example Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) [10] , for further predicting the future numbers of patients in those countries.",
