            "text": "Purpose: To describe a case of endogenous endophthalmitis caused by Enterococcus faecalis in a cat. Methods: Complete ophthalmic examination, routine haematology, serum biochemistry, evaluation of haemostasis, serologic tests, cytologic evaluation and bacterial culture of aqueous and vitreous humor, urinalysis, thoracic radiograph, abdominal ultrasonography, echocardiography, and blood culture were performed. Treatment and follow-up are described. Results: A 3-year-old male cat was presented for vision loss, hyperthermia and lethargy. Ophthalmic examination revealed a bilateral panuveitis with increased intraocular pressure on the right eye. Routine haematology, serum biochemistry, evaluation of haemostasis were unremarkable except a slight decrease of red blood cell count. Tests for diagnosis of FIV, FeLV and Feline Enteric Coronavirus were negative. Cytologic evaluation of aqueous and vitreous humor revealed a suppurative inflammation with the presence of numerous cocci. Enterococcus faecalis was identified by bacterial culture of aqueous and vitreous humor. Urinalysis, radiographic examination of the thorax, abdominal ultrasonography, and echocardiography were unremarkable. Blood culture was negative. No primary infectious site was isolated. The cat was treated with oral ampicillin, oral meloxicam, topical 0.3% gentamicin, 0.1% dexamethasone solutions OU and topical brinzolamide, 0.5% timolol maleate solutions OD. Following this treatment, the cat got well and active signs of uveitis decreased. Six months later, ophthalmic examination revealed vision loss associated with sequelae of anterior uveitis OD and retinal degeneration OS. Conclusions: Bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis is an uncommon cause of uveitis in the feline species. This condition should not be ruled out even if a primary infection has not been identified. Support: None.",

Methods: Medical records were screened for keratomycosis in horses, diagnosed by positive cytology or histology. Results: Of the cases reviewed, 31 (86.1%) presented with ulcerative keratitis, 2 (5.55%) showed corneal infiltrates, 2 (5.55%) had a superficial punctate keratitis and 1 (2.8%) a fluorescein-negative plaque. Thirty eyes received medical and surgical treatment, while three eyes were treated medically only. In three cases the globe was removed at the time of first presentation. The type of medical treatment was compared in the 31 cases presenting with ulcerative keratitis. Three horses underwent immediate enucleation, 16 eyes were treated topically with voriconazole or voriconazole/fluconazole and 12 with other antifungal drug combinations. Different medical protocols did not significantly affect the outcome. Comparing gender, age, pre-treatment with antibiotics or steroids, or type of surgical approach in all horses, no significant differences in outcome were seen. In 23 (63.9%) cases the globe was saved, 11 eyes (30.5%) were enucleated and 2 (5.6%) cases resulted in euthanasia. Conclusions: Regarding outcome, no significant differences between different medical treatment protocols or types of surgical approach could be seen. All cases required aggressive medical and/or surgical treatment. Future studies in central Europe should focus on the identification of fungal pathogens, susceptibility patterns and the efficacy of antifungal drug therapies.",

Methods: For meibometry a sample was taken by contacting an everted eyelid with a special filter paper. This special paper was placed in the Meibometer and read for ten times. Maximum reading expressed in Meibomian Units (MU) was taken as representative for the lipid-concentration of the sample. Study (A) Meibometry of three healthy humans once daily for four days (n 1 = 24 samples). Each sample was read by two investigators (n 2 = 480 readings). Study (B) Meibometry of eleven healthy dogs once daily for ten days by two investigators (n 3 = 220 samples, n 4 = 2200 readings). Each eye was measured by each investigator (Ia, Ib) for 5 days. Data were transferred to PASW statistics version 18 and a paired t-test was used to compare different means. Results: A) There was no significant difference in the maximum reading of the same sample between investigators (P = 0.42). B) The mean of 220 maximums was 166.10 \u00b1 127.37 MU (mean \u00b1 SD). In the same eye the maximums differed between the investigators from 0.37% to 182.56%. Conclusions: Once a sample is obtained repeated measurements by the Meibometer \u00d2 MB560 show only small variation. This is an improvement in comparison to the previous MB550. Different samples taken by the same investigator from the same dog and same eye, show a very wide variation. The origin of the insufficient repeatability of the meibometry seems to be the sampling procedure.",

Therefore, a prospective survey to document ocular symptoms and to evaluate a possible genetic influence was conducted in purebred WHWT. Methods: Of 238 purebred WHWT of different age and gender underwent a standardized ophthalmic exam of the anterior ocular structures obtained by German ESE (European Eye Scheme Examiner) in the years 1998-2006. A pedigree analysis of these dogs was performed. Results: Mean age of the study population was 7 \u00b1 4 years. More females (41% females, 21% female castrated) than males (28% male, 10% male castrated) were examined. The mean age of the KCS group (n = 125, STT < 15 mm/min or above with KCS treatment) was 8 \u00b1 4 years. Significantly more females were affected by KCS (P < 0.05). Predominant ocular symptoms were discharge (60%) and conjunctivitis (60%). Twenty percent of the KCS patients were not treated, 66% were treated. Most common treatment was artificial tear supplementation (58%), antibiotics (30%) and/or ciclosporine A (30%). Despite treatment, the majority of KCS patients still had a STT <7 mm/ min. Preliminary pedigree analysis suggests an influence of the father. Conclusion: Preliminary data of our study are in line with previous studies showing that in the WHWT females and an age >7 years predisposes to clinical signs of KCS. It seems that there is a genetic influence, but more dogs need to be evaluated to unveil the genetic trait.

Methods: Of 34 clinically healthy beagles were included in the study. Baseline corneal sensitivity was first measured using a Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer to determine corneal touch threshold (CTT). Twenty-two dogs received one drop of 0.4% oxybuproca\u00efne solution in a randomly assigned eye, while the fellow eye served as control. The 12 remaining dogs also received oxybuprocaine in a randomly assigned eye and a single drop of 1% tetracaine solution in the fellow eye. CTT was measured 1 and 5 min post-treatment, and every 5 min for a period of 75 min. Results: The overall mean baseline CTT prior to topical anaesthesia was 1.5 \u00b1 0.3 cm without any significant differences between different groups of eyes. In the control eyes, CTT did not vary significantly throughout the observation period. Oxybuprocaine-treated eyes showed a statistically significant decrease in CTT from 1 to 55 min post-treatment compared to control eyes. Maximal decrease in corneal sensitivity was observed from 1 to 15 min post-treatment. The decrease in corneal sensitivity was not statistically different for oxybuprocaine-treated and tetracaine-treated groups. The mean hyperemia and chemosis scores were higher for tetracaine than for oxybuprocaine. Conclusions: The decrease in corneal sensitivity induced by topical application of 0.4% oxybuproca\u00efne observed in this study is comparable with previous reports using other topical anaesthetics in normal dogs. There was no significant difference compared with tetraca\u00efne as measured by aesthesiometry, but oxybuprocaine was better tolerated than tetracaine.",

            "text": "Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of dry cornea transplantation in cats. Methods: Dry feline corneas were transplanted in seven cats with penetrating corneal ulcers or sequestra. Donor corneas were collected from euthanized cats. Epithelium was debrided and the corneas placed in a 1:1 solution of gentamycine and NaCl 0.9% for 3 min. They were then placed on top of a container filled with silica gel, and dried for 5 h in room air temperature. Dried corneas were stored in plastic container without preservatives for up to 6 months. Prior to use, they were soaked in a 1:1 gentamycine and NaCl 0.9% solution for 5 min, and transplanted routinely. In one case, the transplantation was combined with a conjunctivoplasty procedure. Results: Follow up time ranged from 3.5 to 11 months. At the time of the last recheck, 6/7 eyes were visual with minimal signs of inflammation. In three eyes, only minor opacification was noted in the transplanted corneas. In another three eyes (including the combined procedure case) the transplanted cornea became densely opaque, but vision was presented through the peripheral, non transplanted cornea which remained transparent. One eye was enucleated due to severe keratitis and panophthalmitis. Conclusion: Cat cornea can be easily harvested, dried and preserved for a long time. Transplantation yielded very good results in cats, with 6/7 eyes retaining vision.",

Methods: Ten horses, aged 1 month-15 years, with corneal ulcers were treated in this pilot study. Nine horses were presented with deep stromal ulcers and one with a superficial ulcer. Samples for microbiological culturing and cytology were obtained from the ulcers. The horses were sedated with a continuous detomidine infusion, akinesia of the eyelids and topical anaesthesia of the cornea were induced. Isotonic riboflavin eye drops (Medio-cross GmbH, Neudorf, Germany) were instilled every 2 min for 25 min. An UVA-light source emitting 3 mW/cm 2 of 365 nm light (CCL-365; Peschke-Meditrade GmbH, Huenenberg, Switzerland) was used to illuminate the riboflavin-laden area for 30 min. Topical treatment in accordance with results from cultures and cytology and systemic NSAIDs were given postoperatively. Results: CXL could be performed in all 10 horses. Two horses were diagnosed with mycotic, five with bacterial and three with aseptic ulcerative keratitis. The ulcers of eight horses epithelialized after 4-26 days after CXL. During follow-up between 5 and 19 months, no side effects have been observed. One horse with fungal keratitis was enucleated 4 days after treatment due to poor uveitis control. The horse with superficial ulcer did not epithelialize and was then treated surgically. Conclusions: CXL can be performed in standing, sedated horses. Deleterious effects attributed to CXL could not be observed, neither in horses with infectious nor aseptic ulcerative keratitis. Our results warrant further studies of the efficacy of CXL compared to conventional medical treatment.

Methods: Two independent lines of beagle dogs with inherited open-angle glaucoma were established. A total of 81 affected and related normal control dogs were evaluated from birth up to 5-years of age. All of the affected dogs were homozygous for the Gly661Arg missense mutation in the metalloproteinase ADAMTS10. In addition to ophthalmic examinations, incl. monthly diurnal IOP measurements, eyes were collected from selected dogs for evaluation of scleral biomechanics and morphology (n = 8) as well as for examination by electron microscopy (n = 4). Results: In affected dogs ocular hypertension typically developed between 1 and 2 years of age with IOPs consistently >25 mmHg. Stretching and tearing of the lens zonules with protrusion of vitreous into the anterior chamber occurred as early as 6 months of age in the affected normotensive eyes. Zonular ligament dysplasia was present as previously reported in terriers and other breeds with hereditary lens luxation. Scleral resistance to deformation under dynamic loading (i.e. complex modulus) as well as dynamic viscosity were significantly lower between in the affected compared to age-matched controls at 5-7 months of age (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Primary abnormalities in the extracellular matrix of lens zonules and sclera of glaucomatous beagles are suspected to be a direct consequence of the ADAMTS10 mutation. These findings are consistent with Weill-Marchesani syndrome, the homologous human condition.

Methods: Twenty two dogs with SCCED were included in the study, based on a number of inclusion criteria. All dogs were treated by debridement of the corneal ulcer under topical anaesthesia at the first presentation. By lot, 11 were assigned to the study group (application of a bandage lens), whereas the other 11 served as a control group. All dogs received the same topical and systemic medication. On the basis of the clinical findings and on the basis of answers to a questionnaire by the owner, healing time, ocular (dis)comfort and the duration of lacrimation were evaluated. Results: Healing time for dogs in the study population was significantly shorter (mean 18 \u00b1 4 days) than for dogs in the control group (mean 36 \u00b1 17 days; P = 0.005). Complete recovery was seen at the first recheck in all dogs receiving a bandage lens.

Anterior segment OCT (OCT-SA) is a rapidly advancing non-contact imaging device that will have major influence on clinical practice and research in ophthalmology. The aim of our study was to validate clinical usefulness of SD-OCT for corneal evaluation in cats. Methods: We have used OCT for evaluation or feline cornea in 10 normal and 35 pathological eyes. OCT-SA was performed on sedated animals either for non-ophthalmic or ophthalmic conditions with an Optovue iVue SD-OCT device. Corneal diseases were evaluated by biometry measurements with quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Results: In corneal diseases like ulcerations, infiltrations, traumatic conditions, corneal sequestrum OCT-SA provided us with accurate imaging and measurement of depth and extent of pathological process. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of corneal disease was possible and gave us accurate information about all corneal components for further surgical decisions. Conclusion: The advantage of the technique is its very high accuracy that gives excellent imaging of all corneal components in cats without contact. Its limits for corneal use is the low penetration capacity that gives blurred images in heavily infiltrated corneas and the necessity of sedation and good positioning.",

Methods: Records of 14 cases with FBK are evaluated retrospectively. Both genders and different breeds were affected. Their age ranged from 2 to 16 years. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination. Histopathology was obtained in one eye. Results: Of 12 cats were affected unilaterally, two bilaterally. Eleven cats were 9 years and older. Presentation was for sudden onset of corneal hydrops of variable extent. All cats showed signs of chronic keratitis in the affected eye(s). One cat showed signs of lymphocytic-plasmacytic uveitis. Surgical treatment consisted of nictitans flap (n = 7), keratectomy (n = 4), conjunctival graft (n = 2) and/or medical therapy (megestrolacetate n = 14, famciclovir n = 7, lysine n = 5, topical antibiotic eye drops n = 6). In 12 eyes the bullae resolved in 21.7 days (mean) with surgical and medical therapy (n = 8) or medical therapy only (n = 4). In one bilaterally afftected cat the bullae did not resolve with medical therapy alone, and, in another bilaterally affected cat the bulla did not resolve in one eye following a nictitans flap and megestrolacetate systemically. One cat was lost to follow up. Histopathology of one eye revealed deep stromal desintegration and edema. Conclusions: FBK is a rare corneal disease with a characteristic clinical presentation. When treated immediately with mechanic support and/or medical therapy the bullae rapidly resolved in nearly all cases within 3 weeks. Resolution was independent of the extent of the bulla and the underly-ing disease. FBK resembles human hydrops caused by Descemet\u00a2s membrane detachment or break.

This study was instigated to investigate progression of goniodysgenesis within individual dogs over time. Methods: FCRs that had previously undergone gonioscopy under the UK/ECVO hereditary eye schemes were included in the study. A second gonioscopic examination was performed 1 year 11 month-12 year 7 month later (average 5.3 year) and the results compared. Thirty-nine FCR (17 males, 22 females) in the UK and 56 FCR (26 males, 30 females) in Switzerland were included. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy and gonioscopy was performed in all dogs. Gonioscopy allowed classification as either unaffected or affected; percentage of the iridocorneal drainage angle (ICA) affected by goniodysgenesis was determined, before calculating progression observed as mild, moderate or severe. A paired t-test was used to determine if change was significant. Results: Of 37/95 (38.94%) dogs demonstrated evolution of goniodysgenesis (P < 0.0001). Of these, 17/95 (17.89%) were classified as mild progression (from either unaffected to 10-20% or 10-20% to 20-90% ICA affected). Progression of goniodysgenesis was more extensive in 20/95 (21.05%), (P < 0.0001), of which 4/95 (4.21%) went from unaffected or 10-20% affected to severe goniodysgenesis of >90%, consistent with a high risk of glaucoma.

A range of initial diode laser settings between 250 and 500 mW has been proposed. The purpose of this prospective study was to perform a histological comparison of globes treated at these settings. Methods: Seven mature, age-matched, female Beagles were randomized to receive treatment in one eye consisting of either 250 or 500 Mw delivered across 180\u00b0of the ciliary body. Two dogs were euthanized at each of three postoperative time points (24 h, 7 days and 14 days) and their globes harvested for histologic examination. Two additional globes were evaluated as unoperated control and ''sham'' surgeries (no laser energy) respectively. Coagulative necrosis across treated ciliary tissues was evaluated histologically. Results: Explosive tissue vaporization, pigment dispersion and hyphema were frequently associated with settings of 500 mW but not 250 mW. Histologically, earlier time points were characterized by necrosis of the ciliary body, which progressed to fibrosis at later time points. The degree of ciliary necrosis was not significantly different between laser settings. Conclusions: A lower initial setting of 250 mW may be less likely to be associated with the risk of significant intraocular complications without significantly affecting overall ciliary destruction, when performing canine ECP. To determine the nature of early changes in optic nerve head (ONH) morphology that occurs in cats with primary congenital glaucoma (PCG). Methods: Cirrus SD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Dublin, CA, USA) was used to acquire 5-Line Raster Scans centered on the ONH of 11 cats (six normal, five PCG) at 6-month intervals (ages 0.5-1.5 years). Each scan had a signal strength of 10/10. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were measured at time of scan acquisition. Manual measurements of width of the neural canal opening (NCO); maximal cup depth (CD); posterior displacement of the lamina cribrosa (PDL), and pre-laminar tissue thickness (PLT) were obtained by a consistent masked observer using Image J (NIH). One scan for each eye was analyzed at each time-point and results for right and left eyes averaged for each cat. Comparisons between groups were made by non-parametric ANOVA and multiple comparisons post-test, with P < 0.05 considered significant. Results: Compared to normal cats, the ONH of PCG cats had a significantly narrower NCO and reduced PLT, and increased CD and PDL. When examining the effects of age on these parameters, CD was significantly increased and PLT significantly reduced in PCG cats by 6 m of age. The NCO was significantly narrower in 1 year-old PCG cats. PDL tended to increase with age in PCG cats. Conclusions: Initial studies indicate that significant changes in optic nerve head morphology occur in cats with PCG by 6 m of age Purpose: To verify the correlation between central venous pressure (CVP) and intraocular pressure (IOP) in dogs anesthetized with isoflurane and treated with continuous infusion of dopamine or dobutamine. Methods: Sixteen healthy dogs of different breeds and ages, a mean weight of 11 kg were used. The animals were divided into two groups of eight animals each. Both groups were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.0 MAC). The first group was submitted to continuous infusion of dopamine (5 lm/kg/min) and group 2 dobutamine infusion (5 lm/kg/ min). In both groups, the IOP was measured using an applanation tonometer. Central venous pressure (CVP) was measured using multiparameter monitor, except for time zero, because the animal was still awake and therefore not instrumented. The time points used to measure parameters were: immediately before induction of anesthesia (MO), after stabilization of anesthesia with isoflurane (M1), 5 min after start of infusion of dopamine or dobutamine (M2) and then every 10 min (M3) and (M4). Data analysis used the Pearson correlation test. Results: There was no positive correlation between CVP and IOP in any of the times points, both in the left and right eye (Table) .",

Conclusion: Based on the data obtained it was concluded that the central venous pressure does not influence the IOP in dogs anesthetized with isoflurane and submitted to continuous infusion of dopamine or dobutamine. Purpose: Aim of this case series is to describe the Lip-to-Lid Procedure and its outcome for extensive upper and lower eyelid tumors. Methods: From 1999 to 2012 eleven client-owned cats (mean age 11.9 years, eight male, three female) were presented with tumors involving the full thickness of the eyelids. Three tumors were located at the upper lid and eight at the lower lid, of which three involved the lateral or medial canthus. Closure after tumor excision was performed using the Lip-to-Lid Procedure providing a mucocutaneous subdermal plexus flap as described by Pavletic (1). The excised tissue was submitted for histological examination. Clinical and telephone follow-up was performed. Results: Surgical procedures were successful in all cases. A minor wound dehiscence in one cat was revised without further complications. In seven cases with lower lid tumors squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed. Mean follow up time for these cats was 2.3 years (2 month-5 year), four cats died of unrelated disease, two are still alive, recurrence was noted in only one cat with involvement of the medial canthus. The suggested enucleation was denied by the owner and the cat was euthanized 1 year later. The diagnosis in the remaining four cats was: one anaplastic carcinoma and one neurofibrosarcoma (survival time 5 years), one adenocarcinoma (survival 6 months, recurrence) and one mast cell tumor (enucleation after recurrence, lost to follow up). Conclusions: The Lip-to-Lid procedure allows complete excision of extensive eyelid tumors of the lower as well as the upper eyelid with adequate functional restoration. The prognosis appears to be favourable even in the presence of malignant neoplasia. Thirty-eight breeds were represented with a mean age of 9.87 years at the time of diagnosis. There were 60 males and 59 females. Forty-seven cases affected the right eye, 64 the left eye. Clinical signs were recorded in 107 cases, and they were indicative of a retrobulbar mass. The most common clinical signs were exophthalmos, papilledema and fundic abnormalities of the posterior segment, sclera indentation, decreased retropulsion, and RD. Follow-up information were obtained for 36 cases diagnosed between 2001 and 2011: 10 cases deceased because of COM, nine cases are still alive without complications, two cases are still alive with symptoms related to the orbital tumor, nine cases deceased for unrelated reasons, and in six cases the information collected were incomplete to draw any link with the orbital tumor. The mean survival time was 20.7 months, ranging from 5 months to 4.5 years. The mean survival time of the nine dogs which are still alive without complications is 19.7 months, ranging from 5 months to 3 years. The most common histolopathologic pattern was the meningotheliomatous, followed by spindle-cell variant. A characteristic feature of canine orbital meningioma is the presence of foci of myxomatous, cartilagineous, or osseous metaplasia, which could be a useful diagnostic feature if detected in diagnostic imaging. Metaplastic bone cartilage or myxomatous foci were detected in 97 cases. Ninety-four cases showed a subjective decrease of ganglion cells.",

            "text": "Conclusions: This is the largest series of COM described in literature. This tumor grows up in the orbit, leading to compression of the optic nerve. COM is characteristically a slow growing but hard to excise completely with a high risk of recurrence. Purpose: A 44-nucleotide insertion in exon 2 (Ins44) of cRPGRIP1 was previously associated with cone-rod dystrophy (cord1) in Miniature longhaired dachshunds (MLHDs). However, significant phenotypic variability and genotype-phenotype discordance has been observed in a heterogeneous MLHD population and other breeds. This study characterizes the disease, and examines the role of RPGRIP1 gene in cord1. Methods: Retinal structure and function was assessed by clinical ophthalmic examination, sdOCT, electroretinography, histopathology and immunohistochemistry. CRPGRIP1 splicing pattern was analyzed by RT-PCR. Five markers spanning the entire cRPGRIP1 were used for haplotyping. Retinal gene expression was determined by qRT-PCR. Results: Analysis of cDNA from Ins44-homozygous (RPGRIP1 Ins/Ins ) dogs revealed that the mutation disrupts a putative exonic splicing enhancer leading to exon 2 skipping, yet the functional RID domain of RPGRIP1 was expressed. Several new sequence changes including a three nucleotide deletion (D3) that affects the 3' acceptor splice site of cRPGRIP1 exon 19c were identified in MLHDs with retinal degeneration. Each Ins44 and D3 significantly affect splicing pattern of the cRPGRIP1. The haplotype spanning RPGRIP1 was identical in RPGRIP1 Ins/Ins MLHDs and English springer spaniels that were normal or had a retinal degeneration phenotype. Gene-expression analysis showed that Ins44 and D3 affect expression of only a restricted set of RPGRIP1 isoforms which originally have exon 2 or 19c in their structure. Conclusion: The results posit that RPGRIP1 Ins44 is unlikely to be the primary cause of cord1. The causal mutation could be located in another gene elsewhere in the critical disease interval and/or modifiers could be involved. . Results: The mean age at presentation was 3.1 years (range 0.3-7.5 years). There were 12 females and 19 males. The most common reason for presentation was a chronic problem with reduced vision and/or abnormal eye appearance (n = 27 dogs). A subset of these 27 dogs presented because of recent change in vision and/or eye appearance (n = 12/27). Blindness was identified in 25/31 dogs: unilateral (n = 18) and bilateral (n = 7). Abnormal globe size was identified in 22/31 dogs: unilateral (n = 13) and bilateral (n = 3) buphthalmos, bilateral microphthalmos (n = 4), unilateral buphthalmos/unilateral microphthalmos (n = 2). Glaucoma (IOP > 25 mmHg) was identified in eight dogs (eight eyes). 12/19 buphthalmic globes were normotensive (mean IOP 13 mmHg). Lens abnormalities were identified in 36 eyes: cataract (n = 34), coloboma (n = 6), microphakia (n = 4), subluxation (n = 4). Fundic abnormalities were identified in 28/31 dogs: unilateral (n = 1) and bilateral (n = 27) and unknown/not observed (n = 3). Retinal dysplastic lesions without detachment were identified in 33/62 eyes and retinal detachment was identified in 26/62 eyes: partial (n = 3), total (n = 18) and total/disinsertion (n = 5). Follow-up >1 year was available in only seven dogs (mean 4.3 years, range 1.25-9.5 years). Progressive cataract (n = 5 eyes) and development of glaucoma (n = 3 eyes) were recognised. Conclusions: A syndrome of atypical multi-ocular defects associated with retinal dysplasia exists in the ESS. The prognosis for vision and the eye itself is very guarded.",

            "text": "Purpose: Recently, we reported a novel finding of congenital dayblindness in sheep. A mutation in the CNGA3 gene was identified as the cause. Since mutations in CNGA3cause achromatopsia in humans, we decided to evaluate CNGA3 gene therapy using the sheep as an animal model for this disease. Methods: Adeno-associated virus particles containing mouse CNGA3 were injected subretinally unilaterally in three sheep. Operated animals were assessed pre-operatively, and 2 and 6 months post-operatively, using electroretinography to evaluate cone function, and scotopic and photopic maze testing. Age-matched normal and dayblind sheep were similarly assessed as controls. Results: All cone function parameters were significantly depressed in affected sheep prior to surgery. Examinations 2 and 6 months after surgery showed significant improvement (compared to dayblind controls) in a-wave time, b-wave amplitude and flicker fusion frequency (FFF) of both operated and non-operated eyes of the three treated animals. There were no differences between FFF of operated and normal controls. Behaviorally, there were no differences between dayblind and normal controls in scotopic testing, but dayblind animals were unable to navigate a photopic maze. Following surgery, operated sheep were able to navigate the photopic maze without collisions and with timing not significantly different from normal controls. Conclusions: AAV mediate gene therapy seems to improve visual function in both operated and non-operated eyes of day-blind sheep. The long-term electrophysiological and behavioral improvement in this naturally-occurring large animal model may pave the way to similar studies in human achromatopsia patients. Purpose: To study the potential impact of ocular sub-albinism in dogs on the electroretinographic (ERG) recordings. Methods: ERGs were recorded on four young adult beagle dogs (one female and three males). Three dogs presented a sub-albinotic left eye (blue iris, depigmented ocular fundus without tapetum) and a pigmented right eye (brown iris, dark brown fundus with yellow pigmented tapetum). The fourth dog had heterochromia irides, a depigmented non-tapetal fundus and a yellow-green pigmented tapetum on both eyes. Binocular full field ERGs using the Reti-Port with Koijman corneal electrodes (Roland Consult, Brandenburg, Germany) were recorded during dark adaptation and in photopic conditions. a-and b-wave peak times and amplitudes were measured for each record. Results: No significant difference was noticed between sub-albinotic and normal eyes in most of the dogs, for all the recorded responses. One dog presented a difference in mixed response between the sub-albinotic eye and the pigmented eye (a-wave amplitude of 161 versus 238 lV) and Flicker response (33.5 versus 7.2 lV). Another dog had different b-wave amplitudes in the photopic response between subalbinotic eye and pigmented eye (11.7 versus 33.2 lV). Due to the low number of cases and some differences on a-and b-waves amplitudes between dogs, statistical analysis was not possible. Conclusions: In humans, albinism impacts ERGs recordings with an increase of a-and bwaves' amplitudes and a decrease of peak times. In this preliminary study, sub-albinism in dogs seemed to have few consequences on ERGs recordings.",

            "text": "The equine erg and VEP after retrobulbar nerve block and mechanical damage of the optic nerve Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the electroretinogram (ERG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP) after retrobulbar nerve block and mechanical damage of the optic nerve. Methods: Two warmblooded trotters were sedated with a continuous detomidine infusion. Akinesia of the eyelids was induced and pupils were dilated. Light-adapted flash-VEPs and ERGs were recorded (Acrivet RETIport, Roland-consult, Germany). A retrobulbar block was induced using mepivacain in both horses. Light adapted flash-VEPs and ERGs were recorded at different time intervals after induction of the nerve block and in one of the horses also after blocking transmission by crushing the optic nerve. Results: Prior to the retrobulbar block, both horses had normal ERGs and light-adapted flash-VEPs with normal waveforms, including P58 and N130. After inducing the retrobulbar block, ERGs with distinct a-and b-waves with the same implicit times as before intervention were recorded in both horses but the flash-VEP waveform was profoundly affected. The P58 was abnormal and there was a complete loss of later components. After mechanical damage of the optic nerve there was also a complete loss of P58, while the ERG could still be recorded. After retrobulbar block alone, the responses started to recover after approximately 90 min. Conclusions: Pharmacological blockade caused a transient, partial blockade of transmission in the optic nerve, whereas the optic nerve crush irreversibly blocked all signal transmission, although the retina still generated an ERG. This shows that the electrical responses recorded over the visual cortex in the horse is of postretinal origin. Purpose: Case report of a domestic 5-month-old female pet rabbit that was presented with bilateral blepharospasm and epiphora, head tilt and tremor, ataxia and circling. Methods: Complete clinical, ophthalmic and neurologic examination, hematology, blood chemistry, microbiologic culturing from the ocular surface and PCR for human herpesvirus-1 (HHV-1) was done. Results: Severe conjunctivitis, dendritic keratitis positive for Fluorescein and Lissamin green was found bilaterally. At the right eye an additional uveitis was diagnosed. Hematology and chemistry were within normal limits. Microbiology revealed growth of +++ Enterobacter agglomerans. PCR testing was positive for HHV-1. The patient\u00a2s owner, that has been reported to suffer from severe herpesvirus infection, was suspected to be the origin of infection. Therapy consisted of topical Trifluridine, aciclovir, dexpanthenol, serum eyedrops, acetylcysteine and oxytertracycline ointment. Systemic treatment included enrofloxacin, vitamin B complex, fenbendazol and meloxicam. The rabbit recovered from neurologic signs within 2 weeks. One cornea healed within 16 days, the other cornea needed multiple debridements and diamond burr polishing due to delayed healing (6 weeks). Within a follow-up time of 5 months there was no recurrence of neurologic symptoms, but one episode of unilateral dendritic keratitis that was controlled with topical ganciclovir. Conclusion: Human herpesvirus-1 may be transmitted from humans to pet rabbits and therefore seems to have a zoonotic potential. Infections should be considered as a differential diagnosis in animals presented with (dendritic) keratoconjunctivitis accompanied by CNS symptoms.",

Methods: Of 88 ophthalmologically healthy raptors (17 species) of nocturnal (Strigidae, Tytonidae) and diurnal (Acciptridae, Falconidae) families were studied. Tear production was measured using Schirmer Tear Test (STT) and Phenol Red Thread Test (PRTT). Applanation tonometry was conducted. Ultrasonographic measurements of axial length (AL), medial-lateral axis (ML), vitreous body (VB) and pecten length (PL) were recorded. Results: A significant but weak correlation (0.312, P = 0.06) was found between PRTT and STT (Pearson's correlation coefficient). A significant difference (P < 0.0001) in STT, but not in intraocular pressure (IOP), was found between nocturnal and diurnal families and species; IOP, but not STT, differed significantly between nocturnal families; diurnal families differed significantly in all measurements (multiple pairwise comparisons). VB and PL were significantly higher in diurnals (P < 0.001 and P = 0.021 respectively) (Mann-Whitney non-parametric test and student's t-test). No significant difference was observed in AL and ML. When comparing results within nocturnal and diurnal groups, a significant difference was observed between most species for all parameters except IOP (Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test). Conclusions: PRTT and STT are both valid methods to measure tear production; however, a baseline must be determined for each species using each method separately, as the results of one cannot be extrapolated to the other. Due to the significant differences observed within diurnal and nocturnal species, it appears that a more intricate division should be used when comparing raptors, and the classification of diurnal or nocturnal holds little significance in the baseline for these data.",

Results: Ophthalmological examination revealed hyperemic conjunctiva with a perilimbal corneal white ring and short deep corneal blood vessels. A brownish mass was present in the dorsal quadrant of the anterior chamber. An ultrasound revealed a mass in the anterior chamber and a slightly denser vitreum. The clinical examination, haematology, biochemistry, and chest radiographs were all normal. Histopathology showed that the iridal mass was composed of a mixture composed of well-differentiated adipose tissue and normal haematopoietic elements of the three major blood-forming elements (myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocytic). The mass has been histologically classified as a myelolipoma. Twelve months post surgery the dog was physically healthy and without pain. Conclusion: A myelolipoma is a benign tumor-like lesion and has been described in dogs, cats, captive wild felidae, birds, rats, humans and non-human primates. Different locations have been described including the adrenal glands, the spleen, the liver, subcutaneous, the omentum and the spinal cord.

Emergency medical treatment of the left eye did not result in sufficient lowering of intraocular pressure. After successful surgical treatment with transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and gonioimplantation, the dog developed a severe uveitis one month postoperative. Intense medical treatment resolved the inflammation. Eight months after surgery the lens showed a mature cataract while the eye remained normotensive with loss of vision. Phacoemulsification and implantation of an intraocular lens were conducted. Until today, the dog receives topical anti-inflammatory treatment, a topical carboanhydrase inhibitor and a topical b-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Amlodipin is administered as a neuroprotective treatment. Results: Eighteen months after initial anti-glaucomatous surgery and eight months after phacoemulsification and intra-ocular lens implantation, the left eye is visual and normotensive. A few posterior iridal synechiae persisted and some areas of tapetal hyperreflectivity can be seen which are compatible with a good photopic vision and less scotopic vision. The optic nerve shows a small cupping. Optic nerve and retinal vascularisation is slightly attenuated.",

The signalment, age at enucleation, age at trauma, type of trauma, and ocular pathology were compared. Results: Of 69 cases were retrieved including 40 dogs and 24 cats. Enucleation was performed during the first year of life in 28 cases and the second year of life in another 19 cases. Fourteen cases were between 4 and 12 years-old when enucleation occurred. Eye disease was reported to be present since birth in 26 cases and since the animal was acquired in another 10 cases. Fifteen cases had a documented history of injury. All eyes were buphthalmic with broad anterior synechia eliminating most of the anterior chamber. Descemet's membrane was seen intermittently. Conclusions: The pattern of change described in early-life trauma/anterior chamber collapse syndrome is not typical of any of the various forms of anterior segment dysgenesis. In addition to the morphologic findings, the documented history of previous trauma in several cases suggests that this condition is caused by a traumatic event occurring very early in the animal's life. Perhaps before the eyelids open. Support: Funded from the COPLOW general fund.",

            "text": "Purpose: Microbial keratitis is a potentially serious corneal infection that can lead to severe visual loss. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical features of the epithelial defect and stromal infiltration and on evaluation of corneal thickness. It is based on slit-lamp examination. The aim of our study is to investigate the imaging capabilities of anterior segment spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in microbial keratitis and to assess whether measurements of the quantitative parameters, infiltrate thickness and corneal thickness, were possible. Methods: The study was conducted in a private practice referral center. Nine patients -four dogs and five cats (10 eyes) with suspected microbial keratitis underwent standard clinical examination and treatment based on slit-lamp clinical findings. Corneal SD-OCT scanning was performed under sedation or anesthesia on presentation and at least at two follow-up appointments with an Optovue iVue device. All scans were carried out with the scanning beam passing through the center of the infiltration zone. Results: Corneal infiltration was imaged as a hyperreflective area in the corneal stroma on high-resolution OCT scans. Measurements of the infiltration was possible in most of the cases. Corneal thickness could be measured with calipers, ranging from extreme thickness due to oedema to Descemetocoele. Conclusion: SD-OCT imaging provides a range of parameters that can be used to assess microbial keratitis and that can help to choose objectively the best treatment options and follow-up. Purpose: There is a clinical impression that gabapentin (an antiepileptic drug) is a suitable drug which attenuates the intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation associated with tracheal intubation in humans. This study performed to determine the effects of oral gabapentin on IOP following tracheal intubation in clinically normal dogs. Methods: Twenty adult healthy dogs randomly assigned to treatment (n = 10) and control (n = 10) groups. Dogs in the treatment group received oral gabapentin (50 mg/kg) 2 h before induction of anesthesia and dogs in the control group received oral gelatin capsule placebo at the same time. The dogs were anesthetized with propofol 6 mg/kg, and anesthesia was maintained with a constant infusion of 0.2 mg/ kg/min of propofol for 20 min. IOP was recorded immediately before induction and then repeated immediately after induction, as well as 5 min (T5), 10 min (T10) and 15 min (T15) following tracheal intubation in both groups. Results: IOP was significantly higher immediately after induction (27.5 \u00b1 3.1; P < 001), and 5 min after tracheal intubation (25.0 \u00b1 2.4; P = 0.005) when compared with IOP reading before induction (21.6 \u00b1 2.6) in control group. There was no statistically significant change in IOPs immediately after induction (18.6 \u00b1 1.9; P = 0.4), and 5 min after tracheal intubation ( Purpose: To evaluate the role of TNFa in retinal reactive gliosis, and to assess whether Adalimumab (TNF-bloker) could diminish those modifications, in an organotypic culture of porcine retina, an alternative to animal models. Methods: Of 120 porcine neuroretina explants (5 \u00b7 5 mm), from 20 eyeballs, were cultured in Transwell \u00d2 dishes. Controls were cultured in Neurobasal A based medium. Experimental groups involved explants co-cultured with 100 pg/ ml of TNFa (TNF); with 10 lg/ml of Adalimumab (Ada); or with 100 pg/ml of TNFa plus 10 lg/ml of Adalimumab (TNF/Ada). Time-points of study were 3, 6 and 9 days (n = 30 per group/days of culture). Vertical cryostat sections, doubly immunostained with GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and CRALBP (cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein) antibodies, were used for histological evaluation. Results: In controls, GFAP expression corresponding to M\u00fc ller cells and astrocytes, progressively increased and CRALBP remained apparently constant during culture. TNF explants revealed higher levels of GFAP along glial cells prolongations, crossing the outer limiting membrane and invading the supposed subretinal space. CRALBP was reduced during culture and almost disappeared at 9 days. Nevertheless, Ada and TNF/Ada explants showed similar CRALBP and reduced GFAP expression levels than controls, at each time-point evaluated. Conclusions: Adalimumab seems to block, spontaneous and exogenous TNFa induced, retinal reactive gliosis modifications, such as GFAP increase and CRALBP reduction, in an organotypic culture of porcine retina. These findings emphasise the role of TNFa in retinal modifications observed after retinal detachment. Support: Humira \u00d2 samples were a kindly gift from Abbott Immunology, Madrid, Spain. Purpose: The purpose of this work is to evaluate the integrity and the asepsis of equine amniotic membrane (AM) grafts, after different time of preservation in glycerol 98% at room temperature. Methods: Three AM were harvested, at three different times, from the placenta of mares undergoing cesarean section. The AM were cleaned with saline solution alternated to 0.1% povidone iodine solution and a 0.2% gentamycin solution. The membranes were placed on a nitrocellulose paper with epithelium surface up, cut into 5 \u00b7 5 cm pieces and stored in glycerol 98% at room temperature. A sample was submitted to histopathologic examination while a second sample was submitted to culture. These evaluations had been repeated every month for an average of 12 months. Results: Histologically, ''fresh'' AM (1 week of preservation) was composed of a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells resting on a basement lamina that was connected to the amniotic mesoderm. The latter had a superficial acellular compact layer and a deeper layer with a network of loosely dispersed fibroblast-like cells. After 90 days the epithelial cell lining was still recognizable although it appeared discontinuous with shrinkage of single epithelial cells, while mesoderm was denser. After 120 days of preservation the amniotic epithelium was no longer recognizable and the stroma appeared more compacted and dehydrated. The cultures were always negative. Conclusions: We can conclude that after 12 months of preservation in glycerol 98% no significant changes appeared on the AM grafts and the asepsis was maintained.",

            "text": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of the CO2 laser in seven cases of entropion in Shar Pei puppies. Methods: The seven animals included in this study were between 2 and 4 months old and had not previously been subjected to any surgical procedure. The laser equipment used was the Miran 25 and 25 W Expert. The anesthetic protocol used was: sedation with dexmedetomidine and pethidine via SC injection and IV anesthesia with propofol. The surgical technique was performed with the laser in continuous mode (CW) with a power of 1.5-2 watts and a spot size of 0.4 mm. The post-surgical treatment involved cleaning the char produced at the laser application site with Ringer's Lactate and Tobramycin eye drops TID for a week. Results: In 6/7 (86%) cases, the eyelid was successfully unrolled to prevent the hair and eyelashes from rubbing against the cornea. Only 1/7 (14%) cases was unsuccessful and required the application of staples to prevent the eyelids from touching the eye. There were no skin or corneal complications. The procedure was monitored for 1 month. Conclusions: The author considers that the use of the CO2 laser in cases of entropion in Shar-Pei puppies is simple, effective, low-risk and achieves good cosmetic results. Support: None. Purpose: To evaluate sub-Tenon's injection of lidocaine for eyeball centralization. Methods: Three agents were injected into the sub-Tenon's space of 10 eyes from five beagle dogs under general anesthesia: 1 ml of 2% lidocaine (LD1 group), 2 ml of 2% lidocaine (LD2 group), or 2 ml of normal saline (control group). Each eye was assigned to all treatments with a minimum 14 day interval, and the treatment order was random. Changes in eye position, pupil diameter, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were evaluated during the procedure. Results: All eyes in the LD2 group achieved akinesia and mydriasis (pupil diameter > 10 mm) with an onset time of 6.5 \u00b1 4.9 and 4.2 \u00b1 4.3 min, respectively. In the LD1 group, akinesia was induced in nine eyes and mydriasis occurred in seven eyes at 10.7 \u00b1 5.8 and 5.4 \u00b1 2.4 min after the injection, respectively. No changes in eye position or pupil diameter were observed in the control group. Akinesia was maintained for 44.3 \u00b1 26.7 min in the LD1 group and for 88.5 \u00b1 17.2 min in the LD2 group. Duration of mydriasis was 51.7 \u00b1 28.9 min in the LD1 group and 82.9 \u00b1 15.6 min in the LD2 group. No significant change in IOP was observed between the mean pre-and post-injection values in all groups. Conclusions: These results suggest that 2 ml of 2% lidocaine anesthesia injected into sub-Tenon's space provided effective extraocular muscle akinesia and pupil dilation in dogs. Support: Results: 17 FIM were graded 1; 8 graded 2 and 18 graded 3. MMP9 immunolabelled 32/43 FIMs. 15/18 grade 1 FIMs were MMP9 negative or positive in less than 10% of cells (seven and eight cases respectively) In 5/7 grade 2 FIMs more than 50% of cells were MMP9 positive. In grade 3 FIMs, MMP9 was positive in >50% of cells in 9/18, in <10% of cells in 6/18, in 11-30% in 2 and negative in 1. Conclusions: In recent studies on human melanomas, MMPs expression in neoplastic cells has been related to malignant transformation of neoplastic cells. In the present study, about 80% of FIMs were MMP9 immunolabelled. Among these, 83% of grade 1 FIMs were negative or positive in <10% of cells. On the opposite, in most cases of grade 2 and grade 3 FDIMs, MMP9 immunolabelled more than 50% of neoplastic cells. Based on these data, a correlation between malignant phenotype and MMP9 expression could be hypothesized.",

            "text": "Purpose: To immunohistochemically characterize canine primary corneal papillomas and squamous carcinomas (SC) Methods: Paraffin blocks of four papillomas and five SCC from eight dogs were retrieved from the archives (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) . Serial microtomic sections were immunostained (ABC method) with antibodies anti-Ki67 (MIB1), p53 (CM1) and papillomavirus. The percentage of nuclei stained with Ki67 (proliferative index; PI) and with p53 was calculated. Number of mitosis on 10 HPF (400\u00b7) was also calculated (mitotic index, MI). Results: Of 2/5 dogs with SC had a history of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) treated with cyclosporin A (CsA), MI was 0.1-3.8 (mean 1.6; SD 1.5); PI ranged from 34% to 50% (mean 33, SD 12) and p53 immunostained 15-68% (mean 51, SD 9) of cells. All dogs with corneal papillomas had a history of KCS and CsA treatment. MI in papillomas varied from 0.3 to 0.8 (mean 0.5, SD 0.3), PI from 19% to 33% (mean 21, SD 11); p53 24-59% (mean 40, SD 15). Polyclonal antibody anti-papillomavirus stained focally 2/5 papillomas and none SC. Conclusions: Isolated corneal papillomas and carcinomas are rare and mostly observed in dogs with KCS: sustained irritating stimuli initiates corneal epithelium metaplasia and could predispose to neoplastic transformation. CsA has also been advocated as a cause of malignancies in humans and UV radiation have been implicated as carcinogenic factor for corneal SC and papillomas, and UVB can cause p53 mutation. High percentage of neoplastic cells in our cases immunostained with p53 and two papillomas were immunostained with anti-papillomavirus antibody. Most likely several co-factors interact in the pathogenesis of corneal SCC and papillomas. Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of the capsular tension ring (CTR) alone or associated with an acrylic foldable intraocular lens (IOL) in the control of posterior capsular opacification (PCO) after phacoemulsification in dogs. Methods: Twenty eyes of dogs with cataracts were included in this study. They were chosen randomly to receive the implantation of 12 or 14 cm CTR (Acrivet Ring, Acrivet, Germany) alone (n = 10) or in association with a 30 V-12 or 30 V-14 acrylic foldable IOL (Acrivet Posterior Chamber Lens, Acrivet, Germany) (n = 10), immediately after phacoemulsification. The eyes were evaluated at 2, 7, 14, 28, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 postoperative days. Clinical examinations, intraocular pressure (IOP) and flaremetry parameters were used to assess the inflammation. Clinical examination and fundus photographs were used to evaluate the capsular opacities. Results: Although clinical inflammation seemed to be more evident in the eyes that received the CTR plus IOL, there were no statistical differences between techniques regarding to IOP values and flare measurements. PCO occurred only in 1/10 (10%) of the eyes with lens and CTR and a slight opacification was observed in one eye (10%) with the CTR alone until the 180th postoperative day. Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of the V-Prechop nucleodissection technique of in phacoemulsification. Methods: Twenty dogs of different breeds, gender, aged 3-10 years old, with mature (n = 10) and immature (n = 10) cataracts were included. After surgery, patients were weekly evaluated for visual acuity, intraocular pressure and endothelial corneal cell density (by specular microscopy non-contact) and quantitative flare (by laser flare photometry) during different periods. Results: The ''V-prechop'' technique was difficult to apply in patients with mature cataracts. In selected cases of patients with immature cataracts, the technique was easier to perform because the nuclei were softer, which helped to make the linear fragments of the ''V'' shaped method. Still, the eyes of dogs with mature cataract showed more intensive postoperative uveitis, probably related to greater difficulty in conducting the ''V'' nucleodissection.",

This occurrence had been greater emphasis on patients with mature cataract, given the greater intraocular manipulation and increased surgical time because of the difficulty in doing the ''V'' nucleodissection. Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine if dog eyelid tumors express P53 and P63 proteins, which are both tumor markers potentially helpful for prognostic evaluation of those patients. P53 protein controls apoptosis in response to DNA damage and shows important implications on therapeutic practice and the P63 protein has a very important role on the epidermic growth. Methods: Sixteen cases of eyelid neoplasia (eyelid and third eyelid) were selected from the archives from the Veterinary Pathology Service of the Sao Paulo State University (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) . The specimens used from paraffin embedded tissues were analysed by HE technique and subsequently were submited to immunohistochemistry assays using P53 and P63 markers. Results: Thirteen cases of squamous cell carcinoma were positive to P53 and p63 labelling, 1 case of basal cell carcinoma was positive to p53 and p63 labelling, and 2 cases of sebaceous adenoma presented a minimal labelling to P53 and P63 markers. Conclusions: In all analyzed samples the P53 and P63 proteins were expressed. There was a trend of the P53 and P63 proteins to be expressed in higher differentiated and more malignant tumors. Support: Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (Process: 2010/10450-5). Purpose: To evaluate corneal sensitivity loss and recovery after topical administration of 0.4% oxybuprocaine hydrochloride solution in clinically normal cats by use of the Cochet-Bonnet method. Methods: Eighteen clinically healthy domestic shorthair cats were included in the study. Baseline corneal touch threshold (CTT) was established for both eyes of each cat by use of a Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer. Each cat received a single topical application of 0.4% oxybuprocaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (Cebesine \u00d2 ) in the right eye, while the left eye served as control. CCT was then measured for both eyes 1 min after oxybuprocaine application and every 5 min for 60 min. Results: Mean baseline CTT prior treatment was 1.75 \u00b1 0.3 cm for both the eyes subsequently treated and the controls (P > 0.05). In the control eyes, CTT did not vary significantly (P > 0.05) throughout the observation period. By contrast, CTT was significantly reduced from baseline (P < 0.05) for 45 min following topical oxybuprocaine. A mean CTT of 0 was observed at 1 and 5 min for which no cats responded to the maximum stimulation (thread length of 0.5 cm). A markedly reduced CTT of 0.14 \u00b1 0.16 cm was still present at 20 min. In all treated eyes the corneal sensitivity was returned to baseline 50 min after oxybuprocaine instillation. Conclusions: Topical application of 0.4% oxybuprocaine hydrochloride in healthy feline eyes provides a profound reduction in corneal sensitivity for 20 min. This result compares favorably with that previously reported with topical 0.5% proparacaine in cats.",

Methods: Cats diagnosed with conjunctivitis suspected to be associated with FHV-1 were included. Conjunctival cytobrush samples were performed on all cats. Four groups were evaluated: In group 1 and 2, three different samples were collected, the first sample before any topical solution, the second sample after fluorescein and the third sample after fluorescein and oxybuproca\u00efne (group 1) or tetracaine (group 2); in group 3 and 4, two different samples were collected, the first sample before any topical solution and the second sample after application of oxybuprocaine (group 3) or tetracaine (group 4). Nucleic acids were extracted from all samples and a quantitative real-time PCR assay was used to detect FHV-1 DNA. The chi-squared test was used to determine if there was a significantly statistical difference in FHV-1 DNA detection between these samples. Results: Seventy-five cats were included. FHV-1 DNA was detected in 13 from 75 cats. There was no significant difference in FHV-1 DNA detection between samples collected before and after fluorescein, neither between samples collected before and after topical anesthetics application (neither tetracaine nor oxybuprocaine), nor between samples collected before and after topical fluorescein following by anesthetics application. Conclusions: Topical Fluorescein and anesthetics have no effects on the real-time PCR assays used for FHV-1 DNA detection in diseased cats. Our study confirms findings from a previous in vitro study.

Methods: Ten dogs of the different breeds, males and females, aging 1-6 years old with deep corneal ulceration and different clinical progression were divided in two groups: G1 = implant of amniotic membrane, sutured at the edge of the ulcer with epithelial side facing up, associated with the third eyelid flap (n = 5) and G2 = 360\u00b0conjunctival graft (n = 5). The comparative analysis between groups was: complications of the technique used, blepharospasm, ocular secretion, corneal vascularization, epithelial defect and corneal opacification in six moments (first emergency care, surgery and 3, 7, 15 and 30 days of postoperative). It was used a score scale for subjective quantified of the ocular signs. Results: In G2, it was observed the non-adherence of the conjunctival graft to the ulcer (n = 3), dehiscence of the suture (n = 2), anterior synechia (n = 2) and intense chemosis (n = 1). In G1, it was not observed these complications. It was not significant difference between the groups to others ocular parameters, but it was different statistical among the animals of the same groups. The corneal opacity was more intense in G2. Conclusions: According to the clinical results, the cryopreserved amniotic membrane implant proved to be as effective in the corneal ulceration in comparison to the 360\u00b0c onjunctival flap, because probably, the membrane promoted a mechanical support for epithelialization, in addition to its effect in controlling inflammation. Support: Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and appearing of clinical symptoms of chronic superficial keratitis (CKS) in German Shepherd Dogs in Poland and Slovakia. Material and Methods: During the period from 1999 to 2010 the incidence of CKS was diagnosed in 308 dogs of theGerman Shepherd breed in Poland and Slovakia. The sex, age, corneal area surface affected by inflammatory process as well occurrence of pigmentation and corneal neovascularization were assessed. The photo images with calibrated grid aided to evaluate corneal quadrants affected by inflammatory process. Results: In Slovakia, 96 dogs were diagnosed, n = 63 (65.63%) males and n = 33 (34.37%) females. In Poland, 212 dogs were diagnosed, n = 130 (61.32%) males and n = 82 (38.68%) females. The most frequent occurrence of the disease in the dog in Slovakia is between 5 and 6 years of age (n = 27; 28.12%) and in Poland between 7 and 8 years (n = 63; 29.71%). The occurrence of pigmentation on the right and left eye in both countries was the same (right eye 89.81% vs. 89.81% left eye). In Slovakia, most a b s t r a c t s E 9 patients had corneal involvement in three quadrants n = 63 (32.81%), and in two quadrants n = 123 (28.8%) in Poland. Conclusion: CSK was frequently observed between 5 and 8 years of age in Slovakia and Poland. Sex ratio was 1:1.90 (Slovakia) and 1:1.58 (Poland). Most affected were the corneas for 2-3 quadrants, and the occurrence of pigmentation on the right and left eye was the same. Support: This work was supported by VEGA grant: 1/1192/12. ABSTRACT NO.: 57 Hypothyroidism associated neuropathy in a female rottweiler J Rushton, M Leschnik and B Nell Department of Companion Animals and Horses, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria Case details: A 7 year old 46 kg female spayed Rottweiler was presented with the primary complaint of the onset of sudden blindness of 3 days duration. On further questioning, progressive lethargy and gain of weight-not monitored on a scale-over a period of several weeks was described by the owners. The dog was obviously disoriented in the examination room in both bright and dim light conditions. Complete ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral nasal strabismus, enophthalmos and dilated pupils, which reacted promptly but incompletely to light. Dazzle reflex and menace response were reduced but present in both eyes, hence the dog was not considered blind, but disoriented due to the significant convergent strabismus. A marked light induced horizontal nystagmus could be provoked. Complete neurological examination revealed no further abnormalities of cranial nerves or spinal reflexes. Standard blood work revealed a significant increase of canine Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) (0.89 ng/ml) as well as a Thyroxin (T4) value below measurable values. Computed tomography and cerebrospinal fluid examination did not reveal pathological abnormalities. Based on the results of the workup, a diagnosis of hypothyroid associated neuropathy was concluded. The Rottweiler was put on a course of levothyroxin-sodium (T4) (Thyrex \u00d3 20 lg/kg, po, q 12 h), which resulted in significant abatement of clinical symptoms after a period of 2 weeks. Conclusion: To the author's knowledge, this is the first reported case of hypothyroidism induced neuropathy, associated with severe signs of disorientation, convergent strabismus and enophthalmos.

Methods: Descriptive case report. Results: The dog was referred for recentonset of unilateral exophtalmos and peri-ocular facial swelling. The eye was visual. Complete physical and ophthalmic examination including orbital ultrasound revealed a compressing retrobulbar mass. A computed tomography (CT) was performed for further characterize the mass and staging the patient. CT detected a large inhomogenous, hypovascular mass, rarefaction and lysis of the zigomatic and maxillary bones, and enlargement of the ipsilateral mandibular lymphnodes. Thoracic and abdominal CT were unremarkable. Cytological examination of the ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of the orbital mass was not diagnostic and FNA of regional lymphnodes did not showed neoplastic invasion. An excisional biopsy was therefore performed using a modified lateral orbitotomy surgical approach to preserve vision. On histopathological examination the mass was composed of bundles and sheets of pleomorphic spindle-shaped cells ranging from 25 to 50 micrometers, with central, oval, nucleus with clumped chromatin and one or more nucleoli and scant to moderate amount of lightly eosinophilic, fibrillar cytoplasm. Pattern of growth and cell morphology were suggestive of striated muscle differentiation. On immunohistochemistry neoplastic cells expressed desmin, muscle actin and myoglobin. This phenotype permitted to confirm the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. Three weeks later the dog was presented to the referring veterinarian with anorexia and weight loss. The dog was euthanized on owner request without necropsy. Conclusions: Rhabdomyosarcoma could be included among differential diagnoses concerning orbital masses affecting young dogs and puppies.",

Methods: An 8 year-old male dachshund presented to the VTH with swelling and protrusion of both the third eyelids. At the time of submission the dog was in therapy since 4 weeks with systemic, immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids for an idiopathic granulomatous disease (IGD) of the skeletal muscles and skin. A complete ophthalmic examination, an ocular ultrasonography, and a biopsy of the third eyelid were performed OU. Results: A conjunctival firm mass of the bulbar aspect of third eyelid was revealed OU. The mass caused bilaterally a lateral shift of the globe. No other ophthalmic abnormalities were found. At ultrasonography both masses appeared capsulated and homogeneously hypoechoic (diameter 0.8 mm). Histological specimens showed a conjunctival infiltration of macrophages, rare plasmacells, and neutrophils. A few amastigotes of Leishmania were seen in the macrophage cytoplasm. A diagnosis of granulomatous conjunctivitis due to Leishmania infection was made and confirmed by a PCR exam from third eyelid tissue. The ocular masses had a complete regression with aetiological therapy and no recurrence was observed at 1-year follow-up. Conclusion: The two conditions described, IGD and conjunctival leishmaniosis are both characterized by a granulomatous pattern. However, since the IGD showed recurrence at the time of tapering the corticosteroid therapy and needed a maintenance therapy, and the granulomatous conjunctivitis completely resolved by specific therapy, it is likely that the two diseases were concurrent but not correlated.",

Methods: A 9-year-old spayed female domestic short-haired cat was presented for evaluation of an ulcerated mass in the right eyelid about 3.5 cm in diameter. Ophtalmic examination revealed a soft eyelid mass not involving the margin. Cytoreduction with doxorubicin (1 mg/kg ev every 3 weeks) and intralesional carboplatin (4 mg/cm 3 once every week for the first 4 weeks) was proposed. Results: Cytological examination revealed a malignant spindle cell population embedded in abundant eosinophilic matrix, suggestive of myxoid sarcoma. Abdominal ultrasound, chest X-rays, cytology of mandibular lymph nodes had no evidence of metastasis. The neoplasia was reduced in size about 50% after chemotherapy and was then entirely removed by surgery. Reconstruction of the eyelid integrity was obtained with an advancement ''H'' flap. Histological and immunohistochemical (vimentin and Alcian Blu-PAS positive staining) examination of the mass confirmed the diagnosis of myxosarcoma. The tumor recurred after six months with retrobulbar, nasal and ethmoidal involvement at magnetic resonance imaging. Conclusions: Eyelid neoplasias are rare in cats, representing 4.4% of ocular and periocular tumors. Peripheral nerve sheath tumors, spindle cell tumors and mast cell tumors are the most frequently reported malignant tumors (R. R. Dubielzig, WSAVA 2011, Korea) . In the present case chemotherapy and marginal surgery were effective in reducing the mass and controlling the disease for six months. This tumor, to the authors' knowledge, is the first report of palpebral myxosarcoma in a cat and it should be included in the differential diagnosis of eyelid masses.",

            "text": "Purpose: This case report describes the surgical excision technique of eyelid neoplasms by the use of a radiosurgical device. Methods: In this clinical case a full-thickness excision of the upper and lower eyelid neoplasm was performed to remove two meibomian adenomas in a 12 year old dog. The radiosurgery device Surgitron radiolase 2 (Ellman \u00d2 international inc, Oceanside, New York, USA) was used. The upper eyelid neoplasm was larger than the neoplasm on the lower lid, it was ulcerated and was greater than one-third the length of the eyelid margin. A H-plasty (sliding skin flap) was performed to reconstruct the defect on the upper eyelid and simple closure was used to repair the V excision used to remove the smaller neoplasm on the lower lid. Results: Fourteen days after the surgery stitches were removed. Both surgical wounds were closed properly. Two months after the initial surgery we performed radiosurgical epilation of iatrogenic trichiasis of the upper eyelid. Five months after the surgery there was a hair growing towards the cornea, however this was not causing any discomfort to the patient. The offending hair was removed temporarily by manual epilation. Conclusion: The principle of radiosurgery is that a 4 MHz radio wave passes through tissue from an active electrode to a passive electrode. The resistance of the tissue causes evaporation of the cells at the tip of the electrode. The advantage of this very high frequency is that cutting and hemostasis can be produced with much less lateral heat and tissue destruction then with other electrical instruments. Radiosurgery is superior to the conventional scalpel blade technique as there is no detectable tissue resistance during incision.",

General anesthesia was induced with propofol (Propovan, Cristalia, Brasil) 5 mg/kg associated with diazepan (Conpaz, Cristalia, Brazil) 0.5 mg/kg, IV and maintained throughout with isofluorane (Isoflurano, Biochiomico, Brazil) . Under anesthesia the Schirmer tear test (STT) was done and the values were 15 mm wetting/min on the right eye and 12 mm wetting/min on the left one. The eye was treated with dexamethasone/neomycin/polymyxin B ointment (Maxitrol, Alcon, Brazil) TID for 10 days after surgery. Results: The maned wolf recovered without any problem. The esthetic result was excellent. Recurrence did not occur until the present day. Conclusion: At the authors knowledge, this is the first report of third eyelid prolapse in maned wolf, an endangered species.",

Animal studied: A retrospective review of 128 dogs (256 eyes) that underwent ISBCS in three different private referral centers between May 2007 and December 2011 was performed. Procedure: Visual status at final recheck was recorded and intra-and postoperative complications were listed and rated. Data for the first-operated eye (FE) and second-operated eye (SE) were analysed. Results: No serious intraoperative anesthetic incident occurred due to prolonged surgery. The time of phacoemulsification was significantly shorter for the SE when compared to the FE. No case of endophthalmitis was reported. These results were no worse than those reported for classic unilateral phacoemulsification. The risk of blindness and other postoperative complications were not significantly increased in the SE. Conclusion: This study suggests that ISBCS is not associated with an increased incidence of intraoperative or postoperative complications and might be used as a viable option for selected patients. SEs were not at a higher risk than FEs for blindness or postoperative complications.Purpose: To describe the changes of the eyes of cats and a dog with cataracts due to Encephalitozoon cuniculi (EC) after phacoemulsification (PE) and findings of a cat without cataract.

Hence the purpose of this study was to survey a closed herd in three housing systems. Methods: All horses at the federal stud Piber, Heldenberg and the Spanish Riding School Vienna were subjected to ophthalmologic examination. Findings were documented and correlated with influence factors such as age, gender, location and housing situation. The interrelation of abnormalities of different regions was determined by calculating accuracy. Finally pedigree analysis of horses affected by primary cataract was performed. Results: A total of 267 horses met the inclusion criteria of this study. Of these 172 horses were stabled at Piber, 72 in Vienna and 23 at Heldenberg. Ophthalmologic examination revealed 205 cases of ocular abnormalities. A predominant involvement of the conjunctiva (44.6%), cornea (22.1%) and fundus (38.2%) was found. Furthermore in 25 (9.4%) horses a diagnosis of primary cataract was made. No cases of ERU were recorded. Calculation of accuracy did not show any interrelation between different eye diseases. Horses stabled at Piber were significantly more affected by conjunctival and fundic abnormalities. Furthermore fewer abnormalities were found in horses stabled in open boxes. Access to free stalls resulted in more cases of conjunctivitis. Pedigree analysis did not determine inbreeding as a cause for primary cataract formation. Conclusion: The distribution of ophthalmologic findings revealed similar results in other herd surveys, however acquired corneal abnormalities were overrepresented in this study.

Methods: An 8-year-old neutered female German shepherd dog was referred to the neurology department at the Animal Health Trust for investigation of episodes of abnormal behaviour. A full neurological work up, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, revealed no significant findings except for a lesion in the fundus of the right eye. The ophthalmology department was consulted and noted a raised, pigmented lesion dorsal to the optic nerve head. An ocular ultrasound revealed an 8 mm diameter homogeneous echogenic mass protruding into the vitreous from the retina/choroid and expanding caudally to follow the optic nerve for 3 mm. A presumptive diagnosis of an incidental choroidal melanocytoma was made. Thoracic radiography and abdominal ultrasonography to check for metastatic disease was normal. No visual deficit could be elicited. The lesion was monitored closely over the next three months, during which time the behavioural changes worsened and the mass increased in diameter to 12 mm. Exenteration was performed. Results: Histopathology confirmed a choroidal melanocytoma, excised with incomplete margins. Post-operatively, the owner reported a return to normal behaviour. Twelve months post surgery a repeat neurological work up was conducted due to an episode of staggering. The second MRI of the head showed no conclusive evidence of local tumour invasion or other pathology to explain the neurological signs. The dog lived for 27 months following initial diagnosis before euthanasia due to an unrelated condition. Conclusion: The possibility of the choroidal melanocytoma involving the optic nerve causing visual phenomena and subsequent fearful behaviour is discussed. Purpose: To evaluate a new technique for clinical treatment on pigmentary keratitis (PK) in dogs, using diamond burr superficial keratectomy (DBSK), medial canthoplasty and medical therapy. Additionally, assess postoperative complications and the control of the recurrence of the pigment. Methods: Two adult pugs with bilateral PK were included in this study. After undergoing general and ophthalmic examination, the patients were diagnosed with macropalpebral fissures and inferior medial eyelid entropion. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia adhering to the following procedure: correction of eyelid abnormalities by medial canthoplasty, and debridement of the corneal epithelium and superficial stroma using a handheld, battery-operated diamond burr with a 3 mm grit tip. Tobramicyn was injected subconjunctivally, and the eyes were stained with fluorescein to assess corneal damage. Postoperatively, both dogs were administered topical atropine twice a day, artificial tears containing vitamin B12 and tobramycin three times a day. Once the corneal ulcers healed, we began to apply Tacrolimus 0.02% twice a day. Results: The corneal epithelium healed without complications. Currently, there are a few remains of pigment, particularly on one of the patients' right eye, where the pigment was not completely removed with DBSK because it was deeper than on the other eyes. After one month, the pigment has not spread. Conclusions: DBSK associated with medial canthoplasty and immunosuppressive therapy is a promising method for the treatment of PK, and is a more economical and less aggressive procedure than traditional surgical techniques. Further evaluation of DBSK as a treatment for PK is indicated. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this practice.ABSTRACT NO.: 65 Central corneal squamous cell carcinoma in a cat: case report SE Borer-Germann,* C Watt\u00e9,* K Gendron, \u2020 N Regenscheit \u2021 and BM Spiess \u00a7 *Ophthalmology Service, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland; \u2020 Department of Clinical Veterinary Medicine, Clinical Radiology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland; \u2021 Institute of Animal Pathology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland; \u00a7 Ophthalmology Service, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland Purpose: To describe clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of an unusual corneal tumor in a cat. Methods: A 9-year-old European domestic shorthair cat was presented with a mass in the center of the left cornea, which had been progressively growing for 3 weeks. The cat had a longstanding history of unilateral keratitis. Ophthalmic examination revealed a 4 mm diameter, pink rounded mass with irregular surface in the central cornea. Further ophthalmic examination revealed no major abnormalities. Corneal cytology and biopsy indicated a squamous cell carcinoma. Pre-surgical tumor staging included thoracic radiographs, FNA of mandibular lymph nodes and cytology of the bulbar surface of the nicitating membrane. Ocular ultrasonography was performed to evaluate thickness and extent of the mass. Physical examination and routine blood screening were within normal limits. There was no indication of metastasis. The mass was removed by lamellar keratectomy followed by cryosurgery of the surgical bed. Postoperative treatment consisted in systemic anti-inflammatories and topical antibiotic and 0.04% mitomycin-c drops. Results: Histologic examination of the excised tissue confirmed the biopsy results and showed extension of neoplastic cells up to the deep side of the tissue. There has been no tumor recurrence for up to 1 year following surgery. Conclusions: Lamellar keratectomy with adjunctive cryotherapy and post-operative mitomycin-c drops was successful in treating a case of feline corneal squamous cell carcinoma even when surgical margins were not clean.ABSTRACT NO.: 66 Positive antibody titer for Encephalitozoon cuniculi in two cats with cataract in the Czech Republic R Stavinohov\u00e1* and J Petr\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1 \u2020 *Clinic for diseases of dogs and cats, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic; \u2020 Clinical Laboratory for Small Animals, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic Purpose: We detected positive antibody titer for Encephalitozoon cuniculi in two cats with cataract in the Czech Republic (CZ). Methods: Fifty cats underwent ophthalmological and clinical examination at the University in Brno in 2011. We determined five neutered male cats (six eyes) with a median age of 4.4 years to have cataract. One cat had unilateral mature cataract with mass in anterior chamber and another one had unilateral anterior cortical cataract following blunt eye trauma. Because of no obvious cause of cataract, three remaining cats underwent complete blood work, serum biochemistry, indirect immunofluorescence (IgM, IgG) for Encephalitozoon cuniculi (EC) and Toxoplasma gondii (TG), SNAP \u00d2 FIV/FeLV test, ELISA analyzes or immunochromatography for Chlamydiaceae. Results: All three cats were negative for FIV, FeLV and Chlamydiaceae as well. First cat had unilateral anterior cortical cataract, bilateral superficial keratitis, corneal erosion and conjunctivitis and had plasmocellular pododermatitis, was positive to EC (IgM 1:40, IgG 1:80) and to TG (IgM-negative, IgG 1:320). Other one had bilateral anterior cortical cataract, superficial keratitis, corneal erosion and conjunctivitis, was sneezing, coughing and was negative to EC and TG. Third cat had unilateral anterior and posterior cortical cataract, unilateral uveitis and bilateral conjunctivitis, was sneezing, coughing, lethargic and was positive to EC (IgM 1:40, IgG-negative) and negative to TG. Conclusion: This is the first evidence of Encephalitozoon cuniculi in cats in CZ. We suggest screening of seroprevalence of EC in cats in CZ. We consider this to be important due to the zoonotic risk of EC to immunocompromised humans. Purpose: To describe an orbital pseudotumor in a German Shepherd. Methods: A 12-yearold, intact female German Shepherd was presented for apathy and chronic inflammation of the left eye (OS). Ophthalmic examination showed exophthalmos, chemosis and an ulcerated medial periorbital mass OS. Intraocular pressure was 29 mmHg OS and 7 mmHg in the right eye (OD). Apart from the ocular findings, physical examination was unremarkable. Differential diagnosis for the ocular condition included: tumor, foreign body, severe orbital cellulitis, retrobulbar abscess, infectious granuloma (Leishmaniosis, fungal disease), pseudotumor and myositis. CBC and blood biochemistry showed neutrophilia and mild non-regenerative anemia. Abdominal ultrasound and thoracic radiographs were unremarkable. Fine needle aspiration of the mass was non-diagnostic and orbital MRI showed a high signal intensity medial mass (highest diameter 4.7 cm) with moderate contrast enhancement and associated to exotropia OS. Biopsy of the ulcerated periorbital mass was performed. Results: Histopathology showed an extended fibrosis with a multifocal and severe pyogranulomatous inflammatory infiltration. Leishmania spp., Mycobacteria and fungi were ruled out (IPI, Ziehl-Neelsen and PAS). Systemic corticosteroids (0.5 mg/kg twice daily) and azithromycin (10 mg/kg once daily) were started, as well as topical symptomatic medication. After 2 weeks, the mass involved the nasolacrimal system, there was marked epiphora, facial palsy, lagophthalmia and exophthalmia OS. A new MRI confirmed the diffuse orbital invasion. A mass biopsy was obtained by orbitectomy and a conjunctival buccostomy was performed OS. Histopathologic findings were consistent with the previous ones. Based on the diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor, systemic azathioprine was added to the systemic steroids. In 1 month, the orbital inflammation decreased and completely disappeared by 3 months. Until now, the patient has been under systemic treatment for 9 months, with no clinical signs of tumor regrowth. Conclusions: This is the first description of an orbital pseudotumor in a dog. Although pathogenic mechanism could not be established, the canine pseudotumor could be less malignant than the feline. Like in human, the canine orbital pseudotumor can be successfully treated with systemic corticosteroids and immunosupresors.",

Methods: Three dogs (breed Springer spaniel, German Shepherd and Pug), 6-11 years of age were presented with corneal perforating ulcer. One dog, breed German Shepherd, aged 5 was presented with traumatic corneal perforation. The amniotic membrane harvested from cesarean mare section was sterilized in peracetic acid solution. The drying process was performed in laminar flow cabinet. Rehydrated amniotic membrane was sutured to healthy tissue with simple interrupted pattern of 9/0 non-absorbable material (Ethicon). Postoperative treatment consisted of systemic and topical antibiotics (3 weeks), systemic anti-inflamatory drugs (2 weeks), and topical mydriatics. All dogs were reevaluated 2, 4, and 8 weeks after surgery. Results: The successful use of the air-dried amniotic membrane resolved the corneal perforations in both complicated and un-complicated cases. The epithelization occurred within 8 weeks. The presence of vascularization occurred in all patients from libus to periphery of AM, except in case of traumatic perforation. Pigmentation around the AM was observed in one case. Absolute corneal transparency was observed in two a b s t r a c t s E 1 1",
