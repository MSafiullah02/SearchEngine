For some parents or patients, the benefits of vaccination may be seen as being outweighed by the associated risks and costs, however small or unlikely they may be. This is a particularly possible scenario for vaccines against diseases that have virtually disappeared in wealthy countries partly as a result of successful vaccination programs.

Attention by vaccine stakeholders to vaccine-related risks, whether confirmed or alleged, is understandably heightened with respect to children, as is the importance of the potential benefits of routine, on-time vaccination. While striving to make decisions that are in a child's best interests, parents and guardians must navigate a sea of at times conflicting information related not only to vaccines, but also to all aspects of their child's medical care.4, 5, 6 Widely publicized claims by critics of vaccines questioning the safety and value of vaccinations have added to the challenges faced by parents striving to make responsible and informed decisions about their children's health.",

Absent unique concerns raised by parents or providers, communication about vaccines may be left instead to a few short questions and answers or reliance on government-required printed information statements.6 The routinization of vaccines is amplified by state laws in the United States requiring vaccination against many diseases as a condition of school or daycare attendance. This atmosphere of familiarity partially explains the widespread alarm generated by reports of vaccine-related safety concerns, regardless of whether the concerns are confirmed, alleged, or simply a matter of rumor.",

This is especially important as vaccine development efforts increasingly target diseases common in developing countries, often through collaborations in which Western researchers have a leading role. These activities bring needed expertise and capabilities to countries often lacking robust medical research infrastructures and stable health systems, even before considering the potential direct benefits successful new vaccines may bring. During this research and development process, local researchers and health ministries ought to be involved in a meaningful way in all aspects of clinical research taking place in their countries. The benefits of such relationships are many. For example, they may provide additional knowledge and training for local health officials, expertise that could benefit communities long after research has concluded. Meaningful contributions from local officials also create an additional layer of protection to ensure that the generosity of volunteers is not exploited by research that very often would have been deemed unethical had it been proposed for populations in wealthy countries.",

Because of the significant consequences of this debate to the feasibility of future research, attempts at reaching consensus on the question of which standards should prevail have largely failed.13, 15 This longstanding and still unresolved debate provides a useful example of the value of robust discussions of ethical considerations before controversies develop and decisions cannot be undone.",

Bruesewitz v Wyeth affirmed the primary role of the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, not state laws or civil proceedings, in assessing vaccine-related adverse events. Given the concomitant challenges of compensating victims fairly, accurately distinguishing correlation from causation regarding adverse events, and ensuring that manufacturers remain committed to developing and manufacturing vaccines, the current design of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is a generally fair way of resolving these ethical obligations.31\n",

Requirements promote vaccination for individual children, while also striving to limit the potential transmission of diseases among communities to the greatest extent possible. School-entry requirements have long been seen by public health officials as essential to maintaining vaccination rates sufficiently high to preserve herd protection, particularly when other vaccine education and promotion efforts have failed.49 The high vaccination rates associated with herd protection offer benefits against vaccine-preventable diseases to all members of a community, including those too young to receive vaccines, those unable to do so because of medical contraindications, and those who were vaccinated but did not generate the typical, adequate immune response needed for personal protection.",

Instead, respect for autonomy is typically one of several factors that should be examined in light of other relevant considerations as part of ethical deliberation and decision making. There is a compelling argument that the lives saved and suffering prevented by vaccination outweigh the potential infringement on personal autonomy created by school mandates. While one may be free to make medical decisions that place one's own health at risk, one may not jeopardize the health of others, a consequence of low vaccination rates within a community.

Advocates of this view believe it would clearly signal physicians' unambiguous position on the importance of on-time vaccination, and it would reduce the theoretical risk unvaccinated children would pose to other patients in waiting rooms. Critics, including the American Academy of Pediatrics in a longstanding policy statement, believe dismissal of patients in this context should be reserved for the very rare circumstance when conflicts between the views of the physician and parents present a profound impediment to the provision of care to the child.52 In nearly all other circumstances, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends continuing to provide care, in hopes that a growing relationship of dialogue and trust between physicians and parents may lead to a changed position over time. Otherwise, children of parents who delay or decline vaccines may be left without advocacy and find themselves cared for by physicians who are willing to accept any (or no) approach to vaccination, a harmful outcome for those children and their communities alike.4\n",
