In particular, aGVHD of the gastro-intestinal tract (GI-aGVHD) is a major threat to allogeneic stem cell recipients and challenges physicians [2]. In steroid-resistant disease [3], treatment effects are insufficient, hospitalizations extend over months, and patient recovery is complicated by nosocomial infections. In the past, a long list of immune-modulating drugs has been investigated in order to enhance treatment results, with limited effect and no significant difference between treatments [4\u20138]. In retrospective analyses, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) [9] and ruxolitinib [10] were identified as most promising treatments; nevertheless, only a limited fraction of patients in these studies had GI-aGVHD. As a consequence, consensus guidelines recommend the use of high-dose steroids as a first-line treatment, while no standard second-line treatment is generally accepted [4, 11].",

            "text": "Ileostomy is an established surgical procedure, regularly performed in patients with colon cancer resection and in few cases of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Pre-clinical studies indicated physiological alterations following ileostomy, such as increased intestinal absorption and mucosal proliferation, which might be of therapeutic use in GVHD. Intestinal adaptation [12] after ileostomy has been shown in animal models of surgery-induced short bowel syndrome [13] in piglets [14], zebrafish [15], and mice [16], resulting in mucosal hyperplasia through significantly greater crypt depth and villi length. In an ileostomy mouse model, adaptation processes resulted in decreased expression of secretory progenitor cells\u2019 stem cell markers such as protein atonal homolog 1 [16]. In an intestinal resection model, the ileum had a higher adaptive capacity than jejunum, duodenum, or colon [17] and signaling pathways involving molecules, such as insulin-like growth factor [17] or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), have been induced. In zebrafish, EGFR expression significantly increased after ileostomy [15]. EGFR can prevent apoptosis [18], is co-expressed on regulatory T cells [19], and may contribute to immune homeostasis. Little is known on the pathophysiology of ileostomy-induced immune modulation. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease after total proctocolectomy and primary ileostomy rarely develop de novo Crohn\u2019s disease in their neo-small bowel [20]. However, surgery may also induce inflammatory bowel disease [21] or celiac disease in predisposed patients. Amphiregulin, an EGFR agonist involved in autocrine growth stimulation, is weakly expressed in intestinal biopsies of GVHD patients [22] and present at elevated levels in the serum of patients with aGVHD- [22] and late-aGVHD [23]. The status of surgical interventions in GI-aGVHD is controversial due to observed complication and mortality rates [24]. Previous case reports indicated the feasibility of great bowel surgery in patients with GVHD, but left ileostomy\u2019s status in GI-aGVHD ill-defined. Cases included 2 young adults with great bowel resection for complications of aGVHD [25], 2 cases of small bowel resection in chronic GVHD [26], and one elderly patient with laparoscopic left hemicolectomy in late-aGVHD [27]. None of the above-cited reports actually intended to treat aGVHD with ileostomy, neither compared ileostomy to other therapeutic options. To our knowledge, this study is the first description of ileostomy for the treatment of steroid-resistant, GI-aGVHD. At the same time, our data report the largest aGVHD patient cohort with performed ileostomy surgery along with a matched stage 4 GI-aGVHD cohort.",

For outpatients, clinical status and laboratory parameters were recorded weekly. Response to therapy and outcome were assessed according to published criteria [31]. A partial response (PR) in aGVHD evaluation required organ staging improvement, without deterioration of any other organ, and a complete response (CR) required resolution of aGVHD manifestation in all organs. No response corresponded to any change and progression to a flare of GVHD after initial response. For responding patients, follow-up intervals were sequentially extended. Patient outcome was evaluated from date of transplantation until death of any cause or last follow-up. Adverse events were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0 [32]. At diagnosis of steroid-resistant GVHD, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) general performance score and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores were obtained for all patients. Conditioning- and early transplant-related complications were included into comorbidity calculation.",

In the ileostomy cohort, the 5-year OS was significantly (p = 0.002) higher than in the conventional therapy cohort (30% vs 6%). The leading cause of death in the conventional therapy cohort was infectious disease (56%) including sepsis, aspergillosis, and respiratory failure, followed by uncontrolled GVHD (31%) (Table 3). Both aGVHD-related mortality (10% vs 31%) and mortality caused by severe infection (20% vs 56%) were significantly lower in the ileostomy cohort. All respective causes of death are detailed in Table 2. The majority of patients in both cohorts developed aGVHD in more than one site. Response of cutaneous aGVHD was regularly achieved through first- or second-line treatments, while steroid-resistant liver aGVHD remained a challenge to treatment and accounted for 10% of deaths in both cohorts. Cox regression analysis (Table 4) confirmed the OS benefit of ileostomy (hazard ratio (HR) 0.54 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.36\u20130.81; p = 0.003). This result was also verified by a time-dependent Cox regression analysis (HR 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16\u20130.80; p = 0.013). After censoring all patients with early death (< day + 100 of transplantation) of any cause, ileostomy still associated with longer OS (HR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41\u20130.95; p = 0.029). Similar results were obtained when OS was evaluated from the date of GVHD diagnosis (HR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36\u20130.82; p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed no significant OS benefit for most second-line therapies (Table 4), likely due to limited patient numbers in each second-line therapy subgroup. ATG (50% vs 42%) and basiliximab (10% vs 16%) therapies were evenly distributed in both cohorts, while ruxolitinib (30% vs 5%) was underrepresented in the conventional therapy cohort, without resulting in significant OS differences, when stratified with respect to treatment (Table 4, Supplementary Table 2). The application of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) associated with significantly longer OS (p = 0.014), but MMF use overlapped with baseline immunosuppression. Combination of second-line therapies had no significant OS advantage. Patients with GVHD response to any second-line therapy had a significant survival benefit (HR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16\u20130.57; p < 0.0005). As expected for stage 4 aGVHD, involvement of all 3 organs associated with significantly reduced OS (HR 4.23; 95% CI, 1.22\u201314.7). Subgroup analysis of the ileostomy cohort revealed no significant difference regarding the time point of aGVHD diagnosis and of ileostomy surgery.",

Aerobic bacteria were predominantly present after ileostomy (9 of 9 evaluable patients). For 3 patients (30%), all with final ileostomy removal, high numbers of anaerobic bacteria were recorded after GVHD diagnosis and ileostomy.

Patients with stage 4 GI-aGVHD were treated with conventional therapy and received additional experimental ileostomy surgery in order to control GVHD. The majority of patients responded to ileostomy therapy and had a significant OS benefit compared to conventional medical care, alone. In the reported GI-aGVHD cohorts, prolonged immunosuppression together with infectious- and GVHD-associated complications limited long-time survival. The observed mortality rate was consistent compared to reported rates from studies involving GI-aGVHD patients [24, 35, 36], yet the proportion of stage 4 GI-aGVHD patients was higher. In the ileostomy cohort, enhanced control of intestinal aGVHD resulted in reduced exposure to immunosuppressive medication and may have limited infectious complications. Due to the small patient number in the ileostomy cohort, we did not record a significant OS difference between early or late ileostomy (Table 4). In the conventional therapy cohort, the highest mortality was caused by infections, followed by GVHD. The association between GVHD and infectious\u2014in particular invasive fungal [37]\u2014complications has been previously well established, as GVHD associates inflammation, tissue damage, and severe immunosuppression [4].

            "text": "In GI-aGVHD patients, ileostomy resulted in a significant reduction of fecal volumes (Fig. 2), through processes involving, for example, intestinal adaptation, ileostomy-induced immune modulation, and changes of the intestinal microbiota. Post-ileostomy complications include high output [43] as a result of shortened gut surface [44], which may in particular occur in the early post-operative phase of ileostomy [45, 46], an observation that we shared in our study. Within 7 days from surgery, fecal volumes were reduced. Correlative studies in our patients before and after ileostomy support the hypothesis of ileostomy-induced immune modulation. Prior ileostomy, patients had elevated calprotectin values, which may be used as prognostic marker for GI-aGVHD [34, 47]. Patients\u2019 cellular immune status also showed elements of inflammation, such as reduced levels of regulatory T cells and elevated levels of activated T cells. Reducing inflammation can contribute to limit fecal volumes [48]. T cell subset analysis revealed significantly reduced activated T cells after ileostomy, while the number of regulatory T cells and memory T cells increased (Fig. 3). In previous studies of successful GVHD treatments, T cell subset correlations associated with reduced activated T cells [10] or increased regulatory T cells [5, 49]. Due to the small patient number in the ileostomy cohort, changes of memory T cells and regulatory T cells remained below significance. Activated CD4+ T cells play a central role in GVHD-induced organ damage [50]. Their significant decrease as a result of ileostomy-induced immune modulation may help to explain why ileostomy proved successful in GVHD patients. Other previously described candidate pathways of ileostomy-induced immune modulation involve EGFR, whose expression was increased after ileostomy in zebrafish [15] and the mucosal cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22). Reduced intestinal physical stimulation after ileostomy altered the expression of IL-22 [51] and 648 other intestinal genes. In IL-22-deficient recipient mice with GVHD, intestinal apoptosis and mortality were significantly increased [52], while IL-22-deficient donor T cells decreased mortality in GVHD mice [53].",

            "text": "A number of studies indicate that the intestinal microbiota plays an important role in aGVHD [54, 55] and a pilot study of fecal microbiota transfer induced complete response in 3 of 4 patients [56]. We detected changes of intestinal microbiota from pre-transplantation to GVHD and after ileostomy. During GVHD, the detectable number of cultured fecal microbes was lower compared to pre-transplantation samples (Fig. 4). In post-ileostomy fecal samples, the number of aerobic bacteria was higher than during GVHD. In small bowel transplants and ileostomy recipients, increased oxygen levels enhanced intestinal, microbial diversity from strict anaerobic to facultative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria [57]. High intestinal microbiota diversity has been associated with better survival of allogeneic stem cell recipients, due to reduced infectious and GVHD-associated mortality [58]. All 3 patients with later ileostomy removal finally achieved high numbers of anaerobic bacteria. Still, the effect of ileostomy on intestinal microbiota is controversial. Ileostomy may result in nutrient deprivation and less diverse microflora of the de-functioned ileum [59], but has also been associated with an enrichment of bacterial metabolites in the proximal ileum [57] and high inter-individual variation of microbiota [60]. We note the following limitations to this analysis. Data has been analyzed retrospectively and the absolute number of patients in the ileostomy cohort was limited. As patients in this study have been treated between 2009 and 2015, the extent of ruxolitinib use varied between cohorts, without resulting in a significant OS difference. Flow cytometric T cell subset analysis was conducted without intracellular staining.",
