Some individuals respond to stress by eating more and selected foods high in sugar and fat [12, 13] . This emotional eating may contribute to excess energy intakes and weight gain [12] [13] [14] . Torres and coworkers identified that people cope with stress by eating and drinking in an attempt to feel better ('stress-related eating') [14] . These stress driven eaters and drinkers were more likely to consume unhealthy foods and alcohol. Moreover, the lack of emotional support from friends and relatives increased stress driven eating and drinking behaviors [14] .",

A previous study found that higher nonrefined grain consumption is significantly related to lower depression and anxiety compared with controls and these relationships persisted after adjustment for other food groups [15] . The Mediterranean diet is a healthy diet rich in vegetables, fruits and nonrefined grains. It is interesting that higher consumption of nonrefined grains, vegetables, fruits, potatoes, fish and olive oil were inversely related to depression or anxiety severity, while higher consumption of poultry and high fat dairy products was positively associated with higher anxiety symptoms. During the quarantine, changes in the diet contribute to increasing the stress and depression associated with the isolation.",

            "text": "Physical activity as well as relaxing activity could be useful in reducing stress during quarantine. However, the limitation imposed by government restrictions on outdoor activities affects the vast majority of physical activities. The main consequence of quarantine has been the reduction of physical activity. Physical activity motivation is strongly related to social aspects, such as indoor gym groups and team competitions. These activities were blocked and it is presumable that people will reduce exercise. In order to reduce the negative effects of quarantine on health the WHO has just released guidance to \"Stay physically active during self-quarantine\" [16] . These indications are intended for people in self-quarantine without any symptoms or diagnosis of acute respiratory illness and contained practical advice on how to stay active and reduce sedentary behavior while at home. To get these objectives, new technologies and internet could be useful; on-line exercise classes and video-or app-guided aerobics training at home can be a simple and economic tool for performing physical activity. Therefore, to not change the healthy lifestyle habits and to maintain an active behavior at home is very important for the health of the overall population but, especially, for subjects with cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors and for older people [8] . There are several options for exercising and training at home; aerobic exercises like walking inside the house and dancing can be easily done. Resistance training can be obtained by going up and down a step or the home stairs, sitting and getting up from a chair and transporting items with light and moderate weights. Exercise and physical activity play a pivotal role in prevention of cardiovascular disease [17] . Limited physical activity, sedentary behavior and sitting time are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and with several metabolic and mental effects that also would contribute to increase the cardiovascular risk [8, 9, 17] . There are several mechanisms through which exercise training reduces chronic inflammation, including improvement of endothelial function and the capacity to regenerate endothelium after injury [9] .",

A review analyzed the relationship between yogic practice and decline in anxiety and stress and concluded that scientific studies do not report significant reduction. However, due to the self-reported beneficial outcomes for the use of yoga as an intervention for stress and anxiety, yoga may be considered as a possible adjunctive therapy for those experiencing stress during quarantine. The word yoga, meaning 'union', is a mind-body-spirit practice that can include meditation, breath awareness, asanas or postures and relaxation. It is thought to alter nervous system regulation, physiology, psychological well-being and physical fitness. Due to the difficulties in performing exercise in the right way, the practice could be useful in people familiar with this technique [18] .",
