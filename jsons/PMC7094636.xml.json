Since that, significant advances have been made towards the understanding of the important role of miRNAs in cellular pathology and disease etiology (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012). At the evolutionary level, the complexity of an organism correlates well with the number of miRNAs expressed. Mammals express the highest number of miRNAs (Zhang and Lv, 2001) with the human genome capable of expressing ~1000 miRNAs with tissue and cell specificity (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012). miRNAs have the potential to target more than one hundred mRNAs and may therefore affect several biological pathways simultaneously (He and Hannon, 2004). Due to their importance in a wide array of biological processes, miRNAs have also been proposed as novel biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment monitoring and prognosis of a broad range of diseases (George and Mittal, 2010, Guz et al., 2014, Zheng et al., 2011, Hennessey et al., 2012).",

The expression of miRNAs in clusters may result from gene duplication and these cluster-associated miRNAs may target one or several genes in a specific pathway and suggests that they function as a co-ordinated unit (Bartel, 2004).",

            "text": "The function of miRNAs in gene regulatory pathways is a key step in many biological processes. Each individual miRNA may be involved in the regulation of more than one mRNA and each mRNA in turn may be regulated by multiple miRNAs (Valinezhad Orang et al., 2014, Vidigal and Ventura, 2015). MicroRNAs affect gene expression via multiple mechanisms. Down regulation of gene expression by miRNAs can occur at three stages in the transcription/translation process; pretranslational, posttranslational or cotranscriptional silencing. In the pretranslation step, gene silencing occurs via a specialized RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex, containing nuclear Argonaute (Ago) protein, which probably acts through chromatin remodelling (Grewal and Elgin, 2007). MicroRNAs may also exert their effects on gene silencing via mRNA degradation following either deadenylation from the 3\u2032 end or decapping from the 5\u2032 end. Following the loss of the poly(A) tail and cap structure, the remaining mRNA is degraded by cytoplasmic exonucleases. mRNA cleavage may also occur by polysomal ribonuclease1 (PMR1) in a sequence-specific endonucleolytic manner (Valinezhad Orang et al., 2014, Vidigal and Ventura, 2015, Fabian et al., 2010, Garneau et al., 2007).",

The 6 to 8-nucleotides in the 5\u2032 region of miRNA, known as the \u201cseed\u201d sequence, is responsible for the specificity of binding to mRNA targets. This region is highly conserved among species and any change in this sequence may affect its target spectrum (Cai et al., 2009). miRNAs interact with mRNA using Watson-Crick pairing which may be affected by several factors including the degree of complementarity between these paired sites. In addition, the accessibility of the paired sites, RNA secondary structures and the flanking sequence of the miRNA target site also influence the outcomes of hybridization (Valinezhad Orang et al., 2014). Overall, the degree of complementarity between these sites explains silencing: perfectly complementary give rise to degradation of the mRNA whilst translational repression occurs when the complementarily levels are lower (Bartel, 2004).",

Variability may result in either the loss of regulation of target genes or an acquired down regulation of the gene targeted by the native miRNA. For example, a form of hereditary hearing loss is caused by a mutation in the miR-96 seed sequence (Menc\u00eda et al., 2009).

In COPD subjects who smoked, abnormal expression of seventy miRNAs was observed in comparison to healthy smokers (Sessa and Hata, 2013).

Animal models of asthma also demonstrate over expression of miR-21 and miR-26 in airway epithelial cells (Wu et al., 2014, Collison et al., 2011a, Lu et al., 2011) and this is linked to response to therapeutic intervention (Wu et al., 2014).

Sarcoidosis can be defined as an inflammatory disease with enhanced immunologic hypersensitivity to unknown tissue antigens (Abd-El-Fattah et al., 2013, Jazwa et al., 2015). Previous studies reveal a powerful link between host genetics and the manifestations of the disease, however, it was observed that DNA polymorphisms are not enough to fully explain the phenotypic variability (Crouser et al., 2012). Therefore, there is a huge interest in identifying biomarkers for the detection and better understanding the mechanism(s) underlying the development of this disease and miRNAs have been proposed as critical disease regulators as well as being possible disease biomarkers (Jazwa et al., 2015). A number of microarray analysis have been performed studying the pattern of miRNA expression with a view to understanding their possible roles in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. These studies showed a distinct population of miRNAs with a different pattern of expression in the lung and PBMC of sarcoidosis patients. These groups of miRNAs were predicted to target TGF\u03b2 and related WNT pathways which are probably important in disease pathology (Crouser et al., 2012). The abnormal patterns of tissue miRNA expression was shown to be strongly associated with pathological conditions and could promote fibrotic and obstructive lung disease (Maertzdorf et al., 2012).",

HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS which are the members of the RAS GTPase family, contain multiple complementary binding sites for let-7 in their 3\u2032-UTR and so let-7 is considered as a negative regulator of the RAS oncogene family (Guz et al., 2014). Let-7 can also modulate the expression of other proto-oncogenes involved in the G1/S transition such as CDC 25a, CDK16, and cyclin D that are (Leidinger et al., 2011). In addition, it has been recently reported that let-7 targets BCL-2, a proto-oncogene involved in the regulation of apoptosis (Esquela-Kerscher et al., 2008).

These obstacles include miRNA drug delivery, stability and tissue specificity of the therapeutic agent. It is critical to improve our understanding of drug pharmacokinetics as well as minimizing the off-target effects and toxicity (Jackson and Linsley, 2010). Currently two strategies are being used based on restoring or blocking miRNA function particularly targeting the activity and function of tumour suppressive miRNAs. For example, hypomethylating agents such as decitabine or 5\u2032-azacytidine may be applied to reverse epigenetic silencing of miRNAs (Al-Ali et al., 2014). A more specific approach, however, is to use miRNA mimics. MicroRNA mimics are synthetic, chemically modified double stranded short RNAs that can mimic native miRNAs and can be designed to have exquisite selectivity based on a miRNA sequence. Some modifications in the miRNA mimic base sequence is required to enhance uptake or increase their stability to prevent RISC loading.",

Reducing off-target effects of miRNA therapy in lung cancer therapy can be achieved by coating nanoparticles with tumour-specific antibodies. In a model of metastatic melanoma, delivery of miR-34 by coated nanoparticles reduced lung metastasis (Chen et al., 2010). MicroR-34 loss-of-function mutation have been demonstrated in lung cancer (Shi et al., 2014, Xue et al., 2014) and animal models have shown that restoration of miR-34 could lead to regression of tumour growth (Wiggins et al., 2010, Craig et al., 2012, Bader, 2012).

In continue, one of the strands remains on the Ago protein and forms mature miR whereas the other one is degraded.",
