Immune response against PRV have been the subject of many studies primarily in vaccine trials (for review see Zuckermann, 2000, Mettenleiter, 2000). After acute infection swine develop specific antibody and T-cell responses against PRV (Wittmann and Rziha, 1989, Kimman et al., 1994, Mettenleiter, 1996). The latter can be characterised by the activity of antigen specific cytolytic T-lymphocytes (CTL) and by PRV-mediated proliferation of PBMC (Kimman et al., 1995, Summerfield et al., 1996, De Bruin et al., 1998, De Bruin et al., 2000, Zuckermann, 2000). Besides the induction of type I interferons, IFN-\u03b3 production of PBMC has been reported to be a sign of cell-mediated immunity in PRV and other viral infections of swine (Mateu de Antonio et al., 1998, Zuckermann et al., 1998, Zuckermann et al., 1999, Zuckermann, 2000, Suradhat et al., 2001). The interferons (IFNs) are representative cytokines in viral infections that not only play an important role as antiviral agents but are inter-connected regulators in innate and adoptive immune responses (Brinkman et al., 1993, Fearon and Locksley, 1996, Biron, 1998). Within the interferon family, IFN-\u03b3 (formerly \u201cimmune IFN\u201d) represents a single gene encoded cytokine that has been found to be secreted by NK cells and predominantly by activated T-lymphocytes which outlines its role in adoptive immune responses (Vilcek and Sen, 1996). Moreover, the determination of IFN-\u03b3 allows the detection and quantization of antigen specific CD8+ T-lymphocytes and a efficacy detection of other cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-18 (Pittet et al., 2001, Harrington et al., 2002, Speller and Warren, 2002, Domeika et al., 2002).",

All piglets were used for PRV infections at an average age of 10 (\u00b12) weeks (between 20 and 30 kg body weight). The animals were housed and fed in groups of two or four in the isolated stables of the Federal Research Center under standardized conditions. Infection experiments were performed by intranasal PRV spray application (spray bottle, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) with 105\n p.f.u. of the highly virulent PRV strain NIA-3 (McFerran and Dow, 1975) according to the permission No. Ak. Z. 37-9185-81-4 after the German legislation for animal experiments. Starting 3 days before until 12 day after infection (p.i.) rectal temperatures were recorded daily. None of the experimental animals had PRV-specific serum antibodies before the PRV challenge. The relative resistance of cross-bred Meishan piglets to a productive PRV infection without the development of lethal neurological symptoms but accompanied by phases of fever with temperatures >40 \u00b0C has been reported earlier (Reiner et al., 2002). The development of fever was defined according to Gillespie et al. (2000) when the rectal body temperature was measured >40 \u00b0C. Only animals (in total n = 20) that did not show any clinical signs of neurological symptoms such as trembling, in-coordination, ataxia, paralysis circling or paddling and regained physiological body temperature were selected for long-term immunological investigation. Among the experimental infection experiments one was performed with a group of eight animals showing a heterogeneous course of body temperature profiles after intranasal PRV application. Thus this group of animals was divided into three subgroups according to their body temperature course: group A with the expected rise in rectal temperature (n = 2); group B with a moderate rise in rectal temperature (n = 2); group C with no rise in rectal temperature (n = 4) until day 6 after PRV application (Fig. 1\n). To control the take of PRV infection within the subgroups B and C, the six non-febrile animals received a second PRV application but this time intramuscularly (i.m.) at day 6 following the intranasal PRV application (Table 1\n).",

In this experiment the take of infection was questionable because of the failure in rectal temperature rise among the remaining six animals from which only one in group B (No. 29) reacted with short-term fever (Fig. 1B, Table 1). The two animals showing the typical fever response (group A: 21, 22) developed high titers of PRV-specific antibodies as early as 12 days after intranasal virus application (Table 1). The course of body temperature of one piglet (29) in group B showed a short-term moderate rise pointing to a PRV sensitization (Fig. 1B). Both animals had developed low titers of PRV specific antibodies at day 12 after intranasal application (Table 1). The remaining four animals (group C) did not respond with a rise of body temperature within 6 days and also did not have detectable serum antibodies at day 12 after intranasal PRV application indicating a non PRV-sensitized status (Fig. 1C; Table 1). To control the assumption of a PRV sensitization (group B) versus the complete failure of PRV take (group C) a second virus application by the intramuscular (i.m.) route was performed to avoid insecurity in local virus application. The i.m. route of second virus application induced a fever response in all animals from groups B and C (Fig. 1B and C). However, the kinetics of antibody response revealed the difference between preceding PRV sensitization versus the failure of triggering an immune response by intranasal PRV application. Whereas both animals in group B had developed serum antibody titers already 6 days after i.m. infection, the non-sensitized animals in group C needed 12 days for the formation of PRV specific serum antibodies after i.m. infection (Table 1).",

            "text": "After ConA stimulation as a positive control IFN-\u03b3 was detectable in supernatants of PBMC from na\u00efve as well as PRV challenged swine (Fig. 2\n). However, after in vitro exposure to live PRV na\u00efve PBMC never secreted IFN-\u03b3 higher than 40 pg/ml independent of a short (24 h) or longer incubation period (72 h). In contrast after PRV infection, in vitro PRV re-stimulation of PBMC from the same animals resulted in the release of high amounts of IFN-\u03b3 in the culture supernatants exceeding by far those after ConA stimulation (Fig. 2). Although the mean cell viability had decreased by 12% as compared to the beginning of in vitro culture, a significant increase (P < 0.01) in PRV induced IFN-\u03b3 secretion was observed after longer in vitro exposure (72 h versus 24 h) of PBMC to PRV (Fig. 2). The significantly higher IFN-\u03b3 concentrations after longer (72 h) in vitro presence of PRV as the PBMC re-stimulating agent can be explained by a promotion through type I IFN and other cytokines (Brinkman et al., 1993, Manetti et al., 1995; Saraneva et al., 1998, Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2001) as well as by the autocrine IFN-\u03b3 mediated longevity of activated T-cells (Marrack et al., 1999, Akbar et al., 2000). A specificity of PBMC response to in vitro PRV re-stimulation was evident in PBMC supernatants tested 4 weeks after PRV infection. The mean IFN-\u03b3 concentration in the supernatants of PRV re-stimulated PBMC of 12 individuals was 5.195 pg/ml (Fig. 2) whereas the highest IFN-\u03b3 concentration after 72 h in vitro stimulation of the same cells with the closely related alpha herpesvirus BHV-1 was only 82 pg/ml (not shown). The PRV dependence of IFN-\u03b3 release was also demonstrated by the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells in IFN-\u03b3 specific ELISPOTs (Fig. 3\n). Stimulation of PBMC with the same MOI of bovine alpha herpesvirus BHV-1 (Fig. 3B) and medium cultivated cells (Fig. 3A) served as controls. As shown in Fig. 3B, BHV-1 stimulation of PBMC at 4 weeks after PRV infection survival only caused a slightly higher background compared to the cells incubated for 72 h in culture medium alone. In contrast, the same PRV re-stimulated PBMC regularly produced a high frequency of spots indicating a specificity in alpha herpesvirus-mediated induction of IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 3C). Together with the identification of responding lymphocyte subtypes (Saalm\u00fcller et al., 1999) it remains to be determined which component(s) of PRV in contrast to related alpha herpesviruses such as BHV-1 are essential for the induction of IFN-\u03b3 synthesis in antigen primed porcine PBMC. It cannot be excluded that a glycoprotein per se or even certain epitopes might be sufficient for PBMC-mediated IFN production in re-stimulation experiments as already shown with porcine cells for corona virus type I IFN inducing capacity (Charley and Laude, 1988) and recently for herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D induced IFN-\u03b3 production with murine CD4+ peripheral T-lymphocytes (BenMohamed et al., 2003).",

            "text": "The PBMC-mediated, PRV-specific IFN-\u03b3 secretion was also tested after the fortuitous diverse course of body temperature reaction following intranasal virus application in a group of eight animals (Table 1). As early as 6 days after productive infection accompanied by a strong fever response the IFN-\u03b3 secretion of PBMC was significantly higher (2450 and 1838 pg/ml) than the pre-infection level (<40 pg/ml) in the two piglets from subgroup A (Table 1). At that early time point after intranasal PRV application PBMC from the animals in groups B and C which had not reacted with a significant rise in body temperature failed to produce IFN-\u03b3 in response to in vitro PRV re-stimulation (Table 1). However, again in correlation with the development of fever, PBMC from all animals in groups B and C produced IFN-\u03b3 6 days after the second and secure i.m. virus application (Table 1). Thus the productive PRV infection in any case was linked to a fever response and later on to the formation of serum antibodies within 12 days. The latter were also detectable after i.m. application of PRV in the previously non-responding piglets (intranasal application group C) but with a time delay of 1 week compared to the earlier antibody detection (day 12 p.i.m. application) in sensitized animals (group B, Table 1). In addition the PBMC from obviously PRV-sensitized piglets in group B responded with a higher IFN-\u03b3 secretion early after the i.m. virus application (day 6) than the animals keeping a na\u00efve status after the failure of intranasal virus take. Although strong individual differences in IFN-\u03b3 production exist similar to the antibody response (Hessing et al., 1995), a general rise in the IFN-\u03b3 levels in PBMC supernatants was observed later after productive PRV infection persisting at least for 12 weeks (Fig. 2). This is the first example of a direct ex vivo correlation of PBMC-mediated IFN-\u03b3 production depending on productive PRV infection of piglets accompanied by fever and followed by the presence of serum antibodies 12 days after infection. The detection of PRV-specific IFN-\u03b3 production by PBMC offers an early and reliable parameter for cellular immune response preceding the specific antibody formation (Zuckermann et al., 1998, Zuckermann et al., 1999, Mateu de Antonio et al., 1998). Following our observations with sensitized and non-responding animals the IFN-\u03b3 production of PBMC to in vitro PRV (re-)stimulation may be a sensitive reaction to indicate efficient vaccination and to assess the potency of vaccines (Fischer et al., 2000, Dufour et al., 2000, Zuckermann, 2000, Robinson and O\u2019Garra, 2002).",
