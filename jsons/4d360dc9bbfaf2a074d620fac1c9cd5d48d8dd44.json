Clinically, atopy is expressed by asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and atopic dermatitis. It has been recognized that the \"atopic march\" evolves from food allergy and atopic dermatitis in the first 2 years of life, followed by asthma and allergic rhinitis. Over the past 30 years, the prevalence of allergies and asthma has increased significantly in developed countries, and asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Evidence indicates that environmental factors acting early in life, including respiratory viral infections, exposure to pets and microbial products, day-care attendance, breast feeding, and exposure to allergens, tobacco smoke and other pollutants, are key events for establishment of sensitization and development of chronic, persistent symptoms of allergic diseases [1] . It is thought that gene-environment interactions play a crucial role in these processes. Therefore, attempts to successfully prevent development of allergic diseases should be a priority.",

Although acute wheezing episodes may be severe enough to require hospitalization, majority of children presenting wheezing illnesses early in life will no longer wheeze by the age of 6 [2] . However, in a proportion of these children, early-life-wheezing is a clinical manifestation of asthma. Respiratory viral infections have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma in several ways: during infancy, certain viruses have been linked to inception of the asthma phenotype; in children with established asthma, viral respiratory infections play a significant role in triggering acute exacerbations that might lead to hospitalizations and frequent outpatient visits; in children with repeated infections due to day-care attendance or contact with older siblings, respiratory viruses may have a paradoxical effect of reducing long-term risk of allergy and asthma, through alterations of cytokine response profiles.",

In the northern hemisphere, RSV accounts for 60-80% of wheezing episodes in children younger than 2 years of age [3] . It has been shown that children who wheeze with RSV infection in early life have lower level of lung function prior to infection [2] . Most children have serum RSV antibody by the age of 2, yet reinfections are common. Although risk of subsequent wheezing after RSV may decrease significantly with age, recurrent episodes of wheezing due to active RSV infections may occur throughout childhood. Transmission requires close contact, and occurs either by large-particle aerosols or by contamination of hands and inoculation into the eye or nose, with an average incubation period of 2-8 days [4] .",

            "text": "More recently, the role of HRVs in causing acute wheezing has been appreciated. HRVs are small, nonenveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses in the family Picornaviridae , with over 100 identified serotypes with minimal cross-antigenicity [5] . HRV infects only higher primates, and causes illness only in humans, with replication restricted to the respiratory epithelium [6] . In temperate climates, HRV has been estimated to cause up to 80% of autumn colds [5, 7] . In tropical countries, available evidence indicates that HRV is frequently associated with acute respiratory illnesses (ARI). HRV transmission requires close exposure and occurs mainly by hand-to-hand contact, followed by self-inoculation into the eye or nose. It can also be transmitted by airborne spread. Once HRV reaches the nasal cavity, infection occurs in virtually 100% of susceptible subjects; and approximately 75% of those infected develop illness after 1-2 days incubation [5] . Sensitive PCR-based assays have established the importance of HRV as the cause of LRT illnesses, in addition to upper respiratory tract symptoms. A recent study with in situ hybridization applied to lower airway biopsy specimens has demonstrated presence of HRV in the LTR of 45% of a group of children 3-26 months of age with recurrent respiratory symptoms [8] .",

            "text": "In keeping with observations made in temperate climates, it has been shown that infection with respiratory viruses and family history of allergy, were independently associated with wheezing among infants [10] . Results of this case-control study carried out in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, a city in southeast Brazil, revealed that, in the group of children under 2 years of age, respiratory viruses were detected in 60.8% of wheezing infants versus 13.3% of controls, and RSV was detected in 39% wheezing children and none of the controls. Rhinovirus RNA was found in 20.2 and 10% of the wheezing and control children, respectively, though this difference was not significant ( p = 0.21). The frequency of RSV was lower than that reported in temperate regions (39% versus 60-80%). However, considering the subgroup of infants 0-6 months-old, 61% tested positive for RSV antigen. RSV infections were predominantly found in the months of February to May, corresponding to late summer and early to midfall, indicating that the virus occurs in a different seasonal pattern as compared to that of the northern hemisphere. In the group of children 2-12 years of age, respiratory viruses were not significantly associated with wheezing [10] . In the United States, Heymann et al have shown that viral infections, especially HRV, were the dominant risk factor for wheezing among children hospitalized before the age of 3 [11] . In their study, 84% of wheezing children p = 3 years-old were positive for virus, compared to 54% of controls ( p < 0.001); RSV was the dominant pathogen in the winter months among children 2 years-old or younger; however, rhinovirus was detected more often among wheezing children hospitalized in the other months of the year (58%) as compared to controls (26%, p < 0.04) [11] .",

            "text": "One important issue would be whether infections with respiratory viruses particularly RSV and HRV occurring early in life could function as triggers or \"adjuvants\" for subsequent development of sensitization and persistent symptoms of allergic diseases. The rational for this hypothesis would be the potential of these infections to induce significant damage to the airways which might facilitate penetration of allergen(s) and/or trigger events related to airway remodeling. RSV enters the cell by fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane, and causes syncytia formation as a result of fusion of the infected cells to adjacent ones. Replication in the bronchiolar epithelium causes necrosis of ciliated cells, peribronchiolar inflammation with abundant lymphocytes and macrophages, and impairment of secretion clearance, resulting in small airway obstruction and the hyperinflation characteristic of bronchiolitis. Clinically, involvement of the LRT is characterized by tachypnea, dyspnea, cough, expiratory wheezing, air trapping, hyperaeration of the lungs on chest X-rays, and intercostal muscle retractions and cyanosis [4] .The pathogenesis of HRV infection is based on the release of cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory mediators triggered by productive viral replication in a limited number of cells. A number of chemokines, particularly CXCL8 (IL-8), CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein 1 a ) and CCL5 (RANTES) are major mediators released during respiratory viral infections, which could recruit virus-specific T-cells as well as allergen-specific T-cells that in turn could augment any ongoing allergic response in the lung [12, 13] . It has been speculated that the contemporaneous occurrence of cycles of viral-induced and allergen-induced inflammation in the airways during the period of rapid lung growth and remodeling in infancy interacts synergistically to disrupt underlying tissue differentiation programs. This interaction could result in deleterious changes in ensuing respiratory functions, which may then manifest as persistent wheeze and/or asthma [14] .",

A long-term study carried out in Tucson, Arizona, revealed an association of LTR infection caused by RSV early in life with persistent wheezing at 3 and 6 years of age; however, this effect was lost at age 13 [17, 18] . Besides RSV, HRV [19] may be potentially implicated in the subsequent development of childhood asthma. Lemanske et al. have shown that, in a group of 285 children at high risk of asthma, studied during the first 3 years of life, infection with HRV in the first year was the greatest risk factor for persistent wheezing in the third year [20] . The authors showed that 63% of children who wheezed during rhinovirus season continued to wheeze in the third year, as compared to only 20% of all other infants (OR = 6.6). A study in Finland revealed that infants hospitalized for rhinovirus-induced wheezing presented a fourfold higher risk of asthma in school age, as compared to wheezing infants from whom no rhinovirus was identified. Children with atopic dermatitis were especially likely to develop wheezing during HRV infections [21] . These studies highlight the previously unrecognized potential role of rhinovirus infection occurring in early life in the onset of asthma.",

In contrast to studies carried out in temperate regions, viral infections were not a risk factor for persistent wheezing. On the other hand, early sensitization particularly to mites and cockroach, at 2-4 years of age, and exposure to high levels of cockroach allergen in the home in the first 2 years of life were both strong and independent risk factors for persistence of wheezing. It has been consistently shown that early allergen sensitization becomes a major risk factor for wheezing exacerbations and hospitalizations for wheezing after age 3 [17, [22] [23] [24] [25] . It is thought that IgE-mediated inflammation found in most children with persistent symptoms of asthma is a key factor in causing lung function impairment and airway remodeling. Previous studies in Brazil have shown that day-care centers and schools, in addition to homes, are sources of significant exposure to mite and cockroach allergens, which might contribute to sensitization [26, 27] . Heymann et al have demonstrated that sensitization to house dust mites and other aeroallergens was an important risk factor for hospital admissions for wheezing and adverse responses to viral infections, particularly those caused by rhinovirus, in 3-18 years old children [11] , highlighting the synergistic effect of sensitization, allergen exposure, and concomitant viral infection in augmenting inflammatory responses in the airways [28] . The possibility that viral and atopy-associated inflammation may interact synergistically to drive asthma pathogenesis has been raised recently by Kusel et al. [14] . Results of this community-based cohort, involving 198 children followed from birth to 5 years, revealed that acute LTR infection caused by rhinovirus or RSV in the first year of life interacted with atopy in infancy (sensitization \u00a3 2 years-old) to promote later asthma [14] .",

The risk associated with parental smoking seems to be greater at younger ages.

Passive immunization/immunoprophylaxis with monthly infusions of RSV immunoglobulin or monthly intramuscular injections of humanized monoclonal antibody, during the RSV season, reduced the incidence and severity of RSV infections in high-risk children including those preterm babies less than 6 months-old, children with congenital heart disease, and children less than 2 years with bronchopulmonary dysplasia [4] . The large number of HRV serotypes with minimal cross-antigenicity has hampered the development of an HRV vaccine. It may be possible to reduce exposure to HRV by washing of hands after contact with a cold sufferer or after handling objects that may have been contaminated with respiratory secretions [5] . Immunization with formalin-inactivated or live-attenuated multivalent influenza virus vaccines and chemoprophylaxis for influenza virus A are the methods available for preventing influenza.

A double-blind, controlled trial (PREVIA study) investigated the effect of treatment with Montelukast for 12 months in 2-5 years-old children with intermittent asthma. Approximately half of these children were positive for at least one respiratory virus, including HRV, coronavirus, and RSV in their nasal aspirates during exacerbations of symptoms. The results showed that Montelukast had a beneficial effect, decreasing frequency of exacerbations, increasing time between acute wheezing episodes, and reducing the need for inhaled corticosteroids during exacerbations [64] .",

            "text": "Preventive strategies have focused on manipulating the environment of high-risk individuals as an attempt to reduce the prevalence of allergies and asthma in children. At present, six primary prevention controlled studies are in progress [65] . The longest follow-up reported has been from the Isle of Wight study [66] . In this randomized, controlled study, a group of 120 high-risk infants was recruited prenatally, and development of allergic diseases and sensitization to common allergens was assessed at ages 1, 2, 4 and 8 years. Intervention included strict elimination of common food allergens (dairy products, egg, wheat, nuts, fish, and soy) to the age of 12 months. Lactating mothers followed the same restriction diet (except wheat) for the duration of breast feeding. Extensively hydrolyzed formula was given as a supplement to the child from birth, or when breast feeding was discontinued before 9 months. Stringent allergen avoidance measures were also instituted at birth, aimed at reducing exposure to house dust mites. Repeated measurement analysis showed a sustained preventive effect of allergen avoidance on asthma, atopic dermatitis, and sensitization to allergens over the period of the first 8 years of life, and on allergic rhinitis at age 8 [67] . Therefore, the conclusion was that stringent avoidance of mite and food allergens applied to high-risk children in infancy were beneficial and resulted in reduction of allergic sensitization and clinical manifestations of allergy, beyond the period of avoidance [67] . Likewise, outcome of the Canadian Primary Prevention Study on high risk infants has been reported at age 7 years, showing that intervention during the first year of life, comprising avoidance of mite, pet allergens and ETS, as well as dietary regimen, resulted in reduction of asthma symptoms and asthma diagnosed by a pediatric allergist in the intervention group. In the Canadian study, no significant effect of intervention was observed for bronchial hyperreactivity, allergic sensitization, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis at age 7 years [68] . Initial results from other cohorts look promising; however further follow-up will be necessary before any recommendations can be made [65] . Results of the Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study (MAAS) have been reported up to the age of 3, and showed that stringent mite and pet allergen avoidance measures starting during gestation, resulted in decrease in severe wheezing and exercise induced wheezing at age 1, and improved pulmonary function in the intervention group at age 3. However sensitization to mites was increased at 3 years of age [69] . In the Study of Prevention of Allergy in Children in Europe (SPACE), environmental control measures aimed at reducing exposure to dust mite allergens at birth and education failed to prevent sensitization at age 2 [70] . Another study looking at the effects of mite avoidance measures during gestation and education. The PIAMA study, showed a modest benefit of reduction of cough apart from colds at 2 years of age [71] . The results of the Childhood Asthma Prevention Study (CAPS), carried out in Australia, revealed that house dust mite allergen avoidance in conjunction with supplementation of diet with omega-3 fatty acids (abundant in fish and canola-based oils), applied to children with high risk of asthma, resulted in decrease in cough and sensitization to mites at 3 years of age , with no significant differences in wheeze [72] .",

At the end of 18 months of active treatment, they observed a significant reduction in the onset of asthma among grass pollen-sensitized infants and dust mite-sensitized infants. These differences were sustained only for the grass pollen-sensitized infants after 18 months of treatment interruption. They concluded that cetirizine truly delays or, in some cases, prevents the development of asthma in a subgroup of infants with atopic dermatitis sensitized to grass pollen and, to a lesser extent, to house dust mite [75] . More recently, preliminary results of the Early Prevention of Asthma in Atopic Children (EPAAC) study, shows that the use of levocetirizine daily for 18 months was safe among atopic children 12-24 months of age [76] . On the whole, these studies indicate that the antihistamines ketotifen, cetirizine, and levocetirizine are safe for use in very young atopic children, and that they may have a role in preventing development of asthma in some of these children, particularly those with atopic dermatitis, and those allergic to house dust mite and grass pollen at an early age [76] .",

A recent study in preschool children at high risk of asthma revealed that 2 years of treatment with inhaled corticosteroid was highly effective in reducing symptoms and asthma exacerbations, though the benefit was no longer present during a third treatment-free year, indicating that corticosteroids may not have disease modifying effects [63] . In this trial, the Prevention of Early Asthma in Kids (PEAK), 285 children aged 2-3 years were randomized to receive either 88 mcg Fluticasone twice daily for 2 years or placebo, and at the end of the second year, treatments were interrupted. Clinical and functional differences favoring the children treated with inhaled Fluticasone disappeared a few weeks after discontinuation of regular treatment. Recently, two other studies carried out in the United Kingdom and Denmark [77, 78] reached similar conclusions as the PEAK trial: very early treatment of asthma with inhaled corticosteroids, even before the persistent form of the disease has become evident, does not change the natural clinical course of the disease, and does not seem to affect the level of lung function attained at the end of follow-up, despite the fact that this form of treatment is very effective in controlling asthma symptoms while in use [79] .",

Beneficial effects of SIT in children have been demonstrated in preventing new sensitizations in children monosensitized to mites [81, 82] and in slowing the progression to asthma in those with seasonal allergic rhinitis, sensitized to pollen allergens (the PAT study) [83] . Follow-up of children with allergic rhinitis sensitized to birch or grass pollens, who underwent SIT for 3 years [83] showed that the effect of SIT in preventing development of asthma was still evident 2 years after SIT was discontinued [84] . Concerns regarding the use of SIT in asthma include the possibility of severe anaphylaxis; however guidelines have been developed to minimize risks of reaction [80] . Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is increasingly being regarded as an efficient tool for the treatment of patients with asthma and/or rhinitis, as indicated by results of meta-analysis of studies carried out in children and adults [85] . The increased safety and ease of administration of SLIT makes this strategy very attractive as a form of early intervention in young children with IgE-mediated disorders, which could modify the natural course of allergic diseases. Studies addressing the use of SLIT in young children however have not been reported. Issues including standardization of the vaccines, establishment of effective doses and schedules for administration, compliance, and better understanding of mechanisms of action and magnitude of efficacy need further research [85] .",
