At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It spread rapidly, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by an increasing number of cases in other countries throughout the world. In February 2020, the World Health Organization referred to the disease as COVID-19 (i.e., Coronavirus disease 2019). The virus that causes COVID-19 is structurally related to the virus that causes acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and has been referred to as (SARS-CoV-2); and once previously, was referred to as 2019-nCoV.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n",

Early reports indicate that patients with underlying comorbidity are at high risk for developing complications and death following COVID-19. There are also some concerns that the virus may also affect the heart, for example, in a recent Chinese study of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with a median age of 56 and coexisting medical conditions included hypertension (43 [31.2%]), diabetes (14 [10.1%]), cardiovascular disease (20 [14.5%]), and malignancy (10 [7.2%]). The results suggested that among hospitalized patients, 16.7% patients developed arrhythmias, 7.2% developed cardiac injury and 8.7% developed shock. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) appears in about 20% of patients. The first reported cardiac death was a 61-year-old smoker who succumbed to ARDS, heart failure and cardiac arrest. Anecdotal reports suggest that some patients may have developed myocarditis similar to what has been seen with other viruses. Cardiac issues were reported to surpass pneumonia as the leading cause of death in the 1918 influenza pandemic.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\n",

Viruses are known to induce inflammation of the myocardium. In a healthy patient this may not lead to an adverse outcome, but in patients with ARDs, coronary artery disease or heart failure the outcomes may be poor. Since many of the patients affected by coronavirus are elderly with comorbidity, they may be at risk for adverse cardiac events. Other comorbidities like smoking, diabetes, hypertension, renal failure, and COPD may also increase the risk of cardiac death in COVID-19. During the SARS and MERS outbreak there was also concern about adverse cardiac events like acute myocarditis, acute MI and rapid onset CHF. In approximately 60% of MERS cases, presence of one or more pre-existing comorbidities resulted in a worse outcome. Some patients were also found to have subclinical diastolic left ventricular impairment.",

With so much main stream media attention given to COVID-19, where can researchers, scientists, health care providers and patients look for a better understanding of available treatments and research options? One good search engine for finding published medical literature from medical journals is more commonly referred to as (PubMed\u00ae) and is located at the following link https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/.16 If one (i.e., researchers, scientists, health care providers or patients) is more interested in the future or what is currently being studied, then (ClinicalTrials.gov) https://clinicaltrials.gov/ 17 is a very good option. ClinicalTrials.gov is an internet-based registry that provides easy access to a whole host of publicly and privately funded clinical studies. Patients, family members, health care professionals, researchers or anyone else can search and find on-going and completed trials on almost any illness or condition. It is maintained by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Studies are registered before they begin, and list an approximate start date with the status of the study (e.g., not yet recruiting, recruiting, etc.) throughout the course of the study. The primary purpose of the current study was to investigate and summarize the registered trials that listed COVID-19 as the primary condition, while highlighting the importance of the registry to clinicians and patients as a source of therapeutic options.",

Thus, this left 124 trials for analysis. The file was imported into SPSS 1918 and basic descriptive statistics were performed. Trial characteristics such as trial status, intervention, trial phase and classification were summarized and were placed into tables for easy comparison. In addition, the anticipated start date for the trials was used to create a summary graph of the number of studies that expected to start within each month and plotted over time.

As a result of the pathogenesis of the disease21, there is the likely increase in thromboembolic conditions such as acute limb ischemia, acute deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary emboli (PE). Anticoagulation must be considered. Furthermore, vascular interventions will be performed to standard, but with extra precautions (PPE, negative pressure rooms, etc.). If indicated, lysis for PE may be done in the prone position secondary to severe respiratory compromise. Acute kidney injury will require acute placement of dialysis access in the popliteal vein if the patient is in the prone position. Unfortunately, with these and many more evolving scenarios, surgeons will have to proceed without level 1 evidence from ongoing clinical trials.",
