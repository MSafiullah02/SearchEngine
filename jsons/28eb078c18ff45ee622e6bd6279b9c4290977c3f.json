An argument consists of a claim, such as \"We should abandon fossil fuels\", which is supported or attacked by at least one premise, for example \"Burning fossil fuels is one cause for global warming\". From an information retrieval perspective, an interesting task within this setting is finding the best supporting and attacking premises for a given query claim from a large corpus of arguments. Since the same logical premise can be formulated differently, the system needs to avoid retrieving duplicate results and thus needs to use some form of clustering. In this paper we propose a principled probabilistic ranking framework for premises based on the idea of tf-idf that, given a query claim, first identifies highly similar claims in the corpus, and then clusters and ranks their premises, taking clusters of claims as well as the stances of query and premises into account. We compare our approach to a baseline system that uses BM25F which we outperform even with a primitive implementation of our framework utilising BERT.",

This has applications in many domains, including journalism and politics, and in general is relevant for making informed decisions. By now, existing (Web) search engines like Google only provide the most relevant documents to the user, but cannot structure their results in terms of claims and premises. There is a relatively large body of work on how arguments can be mined from text (see [8] for a recent survey). In this paper, we build upon established research on argument search engines and focus on effectively retrieving premises for a query claim from a large corpus of already mined arguments. Here, a query can be either a controversial topic (e.g. \"fossil fuels\") or statement (e.g. \"we should abandon fossil fuels\"), and the task of the system is to retrieve a ranked list of pro and con premises for the query. Since the same logical premise can be formulated semantically similar, an argument retrieval system has to avoid retrieving duplicate results and thus needs to use some form of clustering.",

We do not address the argument mining task. Our work is more similar to the work of Wachsmuth et al. [30] who present Args [3] , one of the first prototypes of an argument search engine. Args operates on arguments crawled from five debate portals (such as debate.org and idebate.org). Given a user's keyword query, the system retrieves, ranks, and presents premises supporting and attacking the query, taking similarity of the query with the premise, its corresponding claim, and other contextual information into account. They apply a standard BM25F ranking model implemented on top of Lucene. In our prior work [12] , we build on the work of Wachsmuth et al. and systematically compared 196 methods for identification of similar claims by textual similarity, using a comparable large corpus of (claim, premise) pairs crawled from several debate portals. The results imply that matching similar claims to a query claim with Divergence from Randomness (DFR) [2] yields slightly better results than BM25 [24] . Thus, we will make use of DFR to find the most similar claims to a query claim.",

Figure 1 gives an example of a corpus with similar claims and premises. A claim may come with a stance, and different claims may have different stances, even though they deal with the same topic. To see why this is important, consider the following example claims and their stances: c 1 = \"We should use fossil fuels\" (positive stance), c 2 = \"We should abandon fossil fuels\" (negative stance), c 3 = \"Fossil fuels\" (neutral stance), and c 4 = \"Should fossil fuels be used?\" (neutral stance). We treat claims with neutral stances as if they had a positive stance. For a query asking for \"increase usage of fossil fuels\", supporting premises would be premises that support c 1 , c 3 , c 4 , but also premises that attack c 2 . Similarly, attacking premises would be those attacking c 1 , c 3 , c 4 or supporting c 2 . Let q and c be query and claim on the same topic, then if q and c have the same stance, a premise supporting c will also support q. Also, if q and c have opposite stance, a premise supporting c will attack q. We write q \u2191\u2191 c if the stances of q and c are aligned and q \u2191\u2193 c otherwise.

While we think that these estimators are reasonable, there are clearly many other ways for their estimation, for example taking argument quality [32] into account; this is left for future work. P (c|q) denotes the probability that c is \"relevant\" for query q, which can be estimated using standard text retrieval approaches; in our experiments, we will use Divergence from Randomness [2] . Since most retrieval approaches are not probabilistic in nature, we need to recalibrate the computed scores such that their values correspond to probabilities. P (p + |c) is the probability that p is chosen amongst all supporting premises of c. Here, we will not use textual similarity of p and c since good premises supporting or attacking a claim often have only small textual overlap with the claim. As an example, consider a user searching for premises supporting the claim \"we should abandon fossil fuels\". A good premise could be \"wind and solar energy can already provide most of the needed energy\", which does not overlap at all with the claim. Instead, we will estimate this based on two different frequency statistics: the premise frequency pf(p + , c), which describes the frequency with which premise p is used as support for claims within c's claim cluster, i.e. with the same meaning as c, and the claim frequency cf(p + ), which is the number of claim clusters for which premise p is used as support. Intuitively, we prefer premises that appear frequently within a claim cluster, and we may want to give lower weight to premises that appear within most or even all claim clusters. This is exactly the same principle used in the tf-idf term weight [25] . We therefore use the inverse claim frequency icf(p + ) in a form similar to standard idf. Since the same \"semantic\" premise can appear in different textual formulations, we will consider its premise cluster instead of the actual premise when computing pf(p + ) and icf(p + ). We can formalise this as follows:",

In general, only few parameters are expected here, which leads to less overfitting. For example, it expects only a method to determine the distance between two vectors and a method to link clusters. For the former we have taken the often used Euclidean distance function, and for the latter the widely used average linkage method [26] , which calculates the mean of two clusters for connecting both. In order to determine a cutoff value for the clustering, we took the implementation of Langfelder et al. [19] , which produces a dynamic tree cut.

To compute the gain of the result at rank i, we first check if it appears in any ground-truth cluster; if not, its gain is 0. Otherwise, let g j be the ground-truth cluster of r i . If no result of this cluster has appeared up to rank i \u2212 1, the gain of r i is rel(g j ); otherwise, its gain is 0 since it does not contribute a novel aspect. As in standard nDCG, the discount for rank i is computed as 1 log 2 i if i \u2265 2 and 1 otherwise. In the ideal gain vector needed for computing nDCG, the component at position i is the relevance level rel(G i ) of G i , which is ideal since ground-truth clusters are ordered by descending relevance level.",

The left visualises the ground-truth for a query with three clusters: G 1 which is highly relevant (score 2), and G 2 and G 3 which are relevant (score 1). On the right are the premises that the system has returned, sorted by their estimated relevance. The ideal gain vector for this ground-truth is 2, 1, 1, corresponding to an ideal discounted cumulative gain of 2 + 1 + 1 log 2 (3) \u2248 3.63. The gains for the result list retrieved by the system are 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 (since duplicate results from the same cluster are assigned a gain of 0), corresponding to a discounted cumulative gain of 2 + 1 + 1 log 2 (8) = 10 3 . The nDCG of this result list is thus (approximately) 10/3 3.63 = 0.92. Task A is more difficult to evaluate since we do not have a list of premises, but of premise clusters (i.e. sets of premises); existing nDCG variants cannot be applied here since they operate on lists of documents, not clusters. To be able to apply the evaluation machinery introduced for Task B, we generate all possible result lists from the list of clusters, compute nDCG for each list, and aggregate the per-list values using either average, max, or min. If, e.g. our system returns two clusters \u03c0 1 = {p 1 , p 2 }, \u03c0 2 = {p 3 , p 4 }, then the result lists (p 1 , p 3 ), (p 1 , p 4 ), (p 2 , p 3 ), (p 2 , p 4 ) are generated. ",

Since this process requires the selection of a representative and is difficult to decide even for humans, we have simply taken the longest premise. The table reveals that the implementation BERT sw , which calculates the premises' embeddings using the 'sliding window' method, performs best. For BERT sw and BERT 512 , the observed improvements over the baseline BM25F are statistically significant for nDCG@5 (tested with Welch's t-test [33] with p = 0.05). Since the baseline only returns a ranked list and not a ranked list of clusters, we interpret this list as clusters each with one entry in Table 2 . We can infer from Table 2 that BERT sw performs best. Using Welch's t-test with p = 0.05 once more, the observed improvement over the baseline is statistically significant for the mean average nDCG@5 but not for nDCG@10. Still, the results imply that BERT sw is at least as good as the baseline for nDCG@10. Note that BERT sw has not even been fine-tuned. Moreover, the results in Table 2 unambiguously underline the importance of clustering and even more the choice of the correct representative. If we always chose the best representative, then we always have the maximum value and vice versa. Note that the premises used in our experiment are extracted from debate portals and thus are not always premises in the sense of argumentation theory, as they often consider more than one aspect.",

In this paper, we made use of the idea of tf-idf and presented a framework for clustering and ranking premises. We used premises from debate portals, which are partially from moderated websites, and of high quality but usually very long. We showed that ranking premises by their frequency and specificity has great potential since our implementation using BERT and a hard clustering algorithm outperforms the baseline BM25F although the model was not fine-tuned and the premises actually cover many aspects, so a premise could be assigned to several clusters. In future work we will integrate soft clustering algorithms, for which we first have to break down the premises into their individual parts (e.g. Argumentative Discourse Units and Elementary Discourse Units) [29] . In addition, we will train different fine-tunings for different sentence embedding models in order to achieve better results. In our implementation, the clustering of the 695,000 premises was not precalculated, instead it was determined dynamically for a smaller subset, since this is a very computationally intensive task. Therefore, we will also precalculate the clusters of premises. To stay within the scope of this paper, we have assumed a flat hierarchy for argument graphs, where an argument consists of a claim and many premises, as they occur e.g. in debate portals. In the future we will extend our framework with more complex structures with more layers.",
