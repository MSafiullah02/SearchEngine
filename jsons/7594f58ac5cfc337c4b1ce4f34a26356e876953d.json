Most specimens yielded at least one organism by either method (92/101, 91%). Among all microorganisms detected (n = 218), 83% and 17% were bacterial and fungal, respectively. Overall concordance between SM and PLEX-ID was 45% (45/101). Concordance increased to 66% (67/101) when discordance for commensal flora was excluded. PLEX-ID failed to detect 21% of all 183 SM-identified organisms, while SM did not identify 28% of the 191 PLEX-ID-identified organisms (p <0.001). There was low concordance for mecA detection. Two infectious-disease specialists' analyses concluded that in most of the 31 discordant, non-commensal cases, PLEX-ID results would have had little or no impact on patient management; in eight cases, however, PLEX-ID would have led to 'wrong decision-making'. The tested version of PLEX-ID concurred weakly with standard methods in the detection of bacteria and fungi in BAL specimens, and is not likely to be useful as a standalone tool for microbiological diagnosis in suspected respiratory infections.",

Twenty-three patients (24%) were intubated at the time of their bronchoscopy. Patients underwent bronchoscopy primarily for presumed pneumonia (76/101, 75%), routine transplant work-ups (12/101, 12%) and malignancy work-ups (5/101, 5%). Most (59/ 101, 58%) post-bronchoscopy diagnoses were not infection related and included interstitial pneumopathies and transplant rejection. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 41/101 (41%); among these, 71%, 7% and 7% were considered to be bacterial, viral and tuberculous, respectively, while 10% were attributed to P. jirovecii; only two cases (5%) of non-Pneumocystis fungal pneumonia were diagnosed.",
