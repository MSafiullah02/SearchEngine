            "text": "Objective: To determine the prevalence of human rhinoviruses (HRV) infections in children with lower respiratory disease in Thailand and monitor the association between species of HRV and clinical presentation in hospitalized paediatric patients. Method: Two hundred and eighty-nine nasopharyngeal (NP) suction specimens were collected from hospitalized paediatric patients admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand during February 2006e2007. Nucleic acids were extracted from each sample with subsequent amplification of VP4/2 by semi-nested RT-PCR for HRV detection. Other viral respiratory pathogens were also detected by PCR, RT-PCR or real time PCR. Nucleotide sequences of the VP4 region were used for genotyping and phylogenetic tree construction. Result: In total, 87 of 289 specimens were positive for HRV indicating an annual prevalence of 30%. Wheezing or asthma exacerbation was the most common clinical presentation observed in infected patients. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree showed that 29 (33%) and 8 (9%) specimens belonged to HRV-A and HRV-B, respectively. Most of the HRV positive samples were HRV-C (58%). Moreover, species C was predominantly found in the paediatric population of Thailand in raining season (p < 0.05). The frequency of co-infection of HRV-C with other respiratory viral pathogens was approximately 40%. Conclusion: HRV-C represents the predominant species and is one of the etiologic agents in acute lower respiratory tract infection, causes of wheezing and asthma exacerbation in infants and young children in Thailand.",

            "text": "Acute viral respiratory tract infections are the major causes of morbidity during early childhood. Among several aetiological pathogens discovered from paediatric patients with either moderate or severe illness, human rhinoviruses (HRV) are the most common. HRV are well recognized as causative agents of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), 1 generally known as common colds that represent the most frequent illnesses worldwide. They are also significantly associated with the severity of several lower respiratory tract manifestations, 2 such as exacerbations of acute wheezing 3 and asthma, 4e7 bronchiolitis, 8 pneumonia, 6, 9 and acute otitis media. 10 HRV share the basic properties of viruses in the Picornaviridae family and contain genomic characteristics that closely related to human enteroviruses (HEV). They are small, non-enveloped viruses, comprising an approximately 7.2 kb of positive single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity surrounded by an icosahedral capsid protein. The respiratory tract epithelial cells are the target of HRV infection. Since the initial discovery of HRV by virus isolation techniques in 1956, HRV have been classified into more than 100 serotypes based on several parameters such as antigen cross-reactivity and nucleotide sequence homology. According to phylogenetic analysis of the VP4/VP2 capsid protein coding regions, HRV were initially classified into 2 distinct species with 75% belonging to the HRV-A and 25% to the HRV-B. In 2006, an as yet unrecognized HRV group, HRV-C, has been detected from influenza-like illness patients by using the MassTag PCR technique. 11 Using molecular techniques, the complete genomes of novel species were characterized by Lau et al. in 2007. 12 And HRV-C was reported as increasing evidence to a significant cause of wheezing, 13 exacerbation of asthma 14, 15 and association with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children. 16, 17 However, recent report describing about the epidemiology of HRV among Asian hospitalized paediatric patients with respiratory tract illness has been limited. To demonstrate details of these data, we focused on establishing prevalence and clinical association of HRV among children with LRTI. In addition, the VP4 region of HRV demonstrated from paediatric patients in Thailand was subjected to genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis.",

Moreover, we mainly detected the novel HRV-C in children with underlying asthma or RAD. This is in agreement with the recent publication. Compare to the Atlanta study, 13 HRVs were detected in 37% (53/142) of paediatric patients with exacerbation of asthma and the majority of HRV strains (62%) identified as species A whereas 28% and 10% were identified as HRV-C and B, respectively. Acute exacerbation of RAD or asthma is frequently the only evidence of infection in our study. This finding is also in agreement with several studies. 3e6, 15,31e38 We also detected RSV as a common co-infection. This may mimic the clinical presentations of HRV infection and may cause more severe disease. Nevertheless, the recent data from a large clinical cohort study (COAST) performed on asthmatic children, indicated that rather than RSV, HRVs infection of lower respiratory tract is the most important predictor of subsequent wheezing in early childhood. 3 Compare to our data, we found both different HRV species and the same species caused different episodes of wheezing-LRI which might indicate a possible association between HRV infection and potential development of recurrent wheezing. 28 In brief, HRV-C infections were the most prevalent HRV infection identified in this study population, and demonstrated a genetically diverse population of HRV-C viruses that circulated in Thailand during the study period. However, further studies would be required in order to understand more clearly about the role of HRV infection as a cause of recurrent wheezing together with requirement of future population-based viral surveillance.
