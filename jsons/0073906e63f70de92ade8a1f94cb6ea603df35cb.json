Of 39 staff personnel with ages ranging from 26-51, none developed symptoms and / or molecular indication of COVID-19 infection. Thirty nine staff were examined with SARS-Cov-2 Realtime RT-PCR between February 20 and March 22 2020. All had negative results with the exception of one staff member who rejected the throat swab test. In addition, 35 staff were examined with the IgM and IgG tests (chemiluminescence immunoassay) for SARS-Cov-2 and all were negative. Four staff were not studied as they had left the facility in the interim.",

Staff who are in direct contact with patients followed biosafety level 2 guidelines, wearing appropriate PPE which includes disposable gloves, disposable gowns, N95 masks, eye protection, cap, and shoe covers ( Figure 3) . Protection at biosafety level 3 is applicable to all individuals performing procedures with a high risk of being exposed to SARS-Cov-2. 1,2 4. Patients were divided into three groups: confirmed COVID-19 patients, patients with some symptoms but unconfirmed infection, and patients without symptoms. Patients were placed in different rooms at different times each treatment room was decontaminated prior to start of daily treatments and after the completion of daily treatments each day. Following each patient's treatment, the tabletop of the linear accelerator and the path traversed by the patient was decontaminated (Figure 4) . 5. Hand hygiene is a simple yet effective way to prevent SARS-Cov-2 infections. Staff and patients were required to wash their hands following the \"seven step guide of hand-washing\" 3 for at least 20 seconds or to clean hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol. Hand hygiene was performed by staff before and after contact with patients or their surrounding environment; during steps of removing PPE; and before leaving the treatment room. PPE were disposed of promptly into a clinical waste bin used for infectious or contaminated waste. Staff wore an N95 mask when in contact with patients and a surgical mask at other times.",

The distance between patients was at least 1.5 meters. All patients were followed up for 14 days to make sure there is no SARS-Cov-2 infection. 7. UV irradiation is recommended for the cleaning and sterilization of air. 75% alcohol is recommended for surfaces, such as personal electronic, linear accelerator, treatment couch. Chlorine-containing detergent is recommended for daily floor and walls cleaning. 4 These recommendations are based on what was carried out in Wuhan and are supported by the testing results and follow up studies. We hope these data procedures are found useful in countries and regions in different stages of the pandemic attempting to deliver high quality radiotherapy. In addition, there are serious questions being raised as to how to re-open aspects of health care after the initial wave of cases is mitigated. These procedures here demonstrate that even in the height of infection serious adverse events to staff and patients can be mitigated in a high volume radiation oncology center and may serve as a blueprint for going forward. Following each patient's treatment, the treatment room was decontaminated using 75% alcohol locally including the linear accelerator and the path traversed by the patient.",
