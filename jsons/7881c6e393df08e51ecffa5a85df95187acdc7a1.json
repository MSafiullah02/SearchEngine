            "text": "A 12-year-old, 4 kg, castrated male Persian cat was referred with a 2-month history of sneezing and bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge. Rhinoscopically acquired nasal biopsies at this time revealed bilateral lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis. A tapering dose of oral prednisone caused the complete remission of the clinical signs, but 2 months after discontinuation of the therapy, the rhinitis recurred and the OD became exophthalmic. Computed tomography showed a soft tissue mass in both sides of the nasal cavity, both frontal sinuses, the right orbit, and to a lesser extent the left orbit. A fine needle aspirate of the right orbit revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation and Aspergillus spp. hyphae. Repeat nasal biopsy demonstrated multi-focal necrosis and a mixed inflammatory cell process which now included macrophages and scattered septate fungal hyphae. A few days later the cat became bilaterally blind and a contrast enhancing lesion involving the optic chiasm was found on magnetic resonance imaging. Despite a poor prognosis, therapy consisted of exenteration of the right orbit and trephination of both frontal sinuses before the planned initiation of medical antifungal therapy. Unfortunately, the cat died of cardiac arrest intraoperatively. Aspergillus fumigatus was cultured from both orbits at necropsy. Orbital aspergillosis has been rarely reported in cats and its relationship with lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis is unclear. In this patient lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis or previous antibiotic/corticosteroid therapy may have allowed secondary fungal invasion of the nasal mucosa and subsequently both orbits and the brain. Alternatively, Aspergillus infection may have preceded the lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis.",

            "text": "The factors that predispose cats to orbital mycosis are also unclear. Systemic mycoses are frequently suggested to be associated with immunosuppression (e.g. panleukopenia, feline infectious peritonitis, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus, multiple diseases, or glucocorticoid therapy), or with previous antibiotic therapy, but data supporting these assertions are often sparse. 1, 3, 4, 7, 13, 14 Local alterations in immune competency may also be important in allowing fungal colonization of the nasal passages or sinuses. Idiopathic chronic lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis (LPR) in cats has been associated with reduced mucociliary clearance of the nasal mucosa, which may allow fungal colonization and invasion of the upper respiratory tract. 15 LPR is a relatively common nasal disorder in cats and dogs. [15] [16] [17] [18] The definitive etiology of this condition is still undetermined, although some authors believe that it is the result of a chronic inflammatory response to an inhaled irritant, pollutant or allergen. 15, 16 An immune-mediated pathogenesis has also been suggested. [17] [18] [19] Recent theories also support the possibility that LPR may have an infectious trigger. [15] [16] [17] [18] With chronic LPR, nasal secretions become progressively more mucoid as mucus-secreting glands within the nasal mucosa proliferate and become hypersecretory in response to chronic inflammation. Reduced mucociliary clearance of nasal secretions creates an ideal microenvironment for proliferation of bacteria or fungi, with a resultant increased susceptibility to secondary infections. 15 Furthermore, corticosteroid therapy or antibiotic therapy may also serve as predisposing factor in deep fungal infections.",

On this examination the OD was exophthalmic, deviated dorso-laterally, and exhibited pronounced resistance to retropulsion. The motility of the globe was impaired in all directions and resisted forced duction testing. The conjunctiva of this eye was moderately hyperemic, and the third eyelid was prominent, hyperemic and slightly thickened. The right cornea also had an exposure keratitis characterized by extensive corneal edema and a 1-cm diameter, deeply vascularized, central corneal ulcer which extended to one-half of the normal corneal thickness (Fig. 3 ). The OD did not exhibit a menace response and the corneal opacity prevented determination of whether a direct pupillary light reflex was present in this eye. Stimulation of the OD with a bright light source failed to elicit a consensual pupillary light reflex in the OS. The OS retained vision and had unremarkable ocular structures, motility, and reflexes, except for a moderate resistance to the globe retropulsion that was greater than the normal expected resistance to retropulsion in a brachycephalic cat. Intraocular pressure, measured by applanation tonometry, was 14 and 20 mmHg in OD and OS, respectively.",

These included: orbital fungal or bacterial infection, a retained intranasal foreign body with extension of the inflammatory response into the orbit, neoplasia initially involving the respiratory passages and now the orbit, orbital pseudotumor extending into the upper respiratory tract, or eosinophilic infiltrates/granulomas. Less likely considerations included disorders of the zygomatic salivary gland (salivary adenitis or mucocele), and subconjunctival emphysema. [20] [21] [22] [23] Because the cat's disease had progressed and the changes were no longer consistent with a simple lymphocytic/plasmacytic rhinitis the owner now consented to a more detailed evaluation. At this time a complete blood count, serum biochemical analysis and routine urinalysis were unremarkable. Serological testing for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen, feline immuno-deficiency virus (FIV) and coronavirus antibody also proved negative. The cat was then anesthetized for evaluation of the nasal cavities, sinuses and orbits by computed tomography (CT) and repeat rhinoscopy. Computed tomography revealed a large mass ventro-medially within the right orbit which was displacing the globe dorso-laterally, focal lysis of the right lacrimal bone, and abnormal soft tissue density in both frontal sinuses and both sides of the nasal cavity. This tissue had indistinct borders and completely invaded the frontal sinuses, nasal conchae, and portions of the right ventral nasal meatus. This mass slightly indented the right globe (Fig. 4) . In addition to the changes in the right orbit there also was a moderately sized, soft tissue density mass ventro-medially within the left orbit. The optic chiasm and both optic nerves did not show any abnormalities. Transpalpebral fine-needle aspirates of the mass in the right orbit were acquired with CT guidance.",

Numerous PAS stain-positive, septate, fungal hyphae were also visible. The morphologic appearance of the organism was consistent with Aspergillus spp. Histopathology of the nasal mucosa biopsies revealed a mixed inflammatory cell population, mostly composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells and scattered eosinophils. In contrast to the first rhinoscopically acquired biopsy, however, a significant number of macrophages were also present, indicating that the inflammatory response had acquired a granulomatous component since the first biopsy several months before. A small number of fungal hyphae were detected within areas of coagulative necrosis on the surface of ulcerated nasal turbinates (Fig. 7) . These were characterized by parallel walls, relatively uniform width (3-7 \u03bc m), occasional acute-angle dichotomous branching, and apical bulbous dilations, consistent with Aspergillus spp. Intense turbinate bone remodeling was also present. A diagnosis of fungal rhinitis, presumptive fungal sinusitis, fungal orbital cellulitis, and inflammation of the optic chiasm was made. Given the rhinoscopic appearance of the nasal passages, the clinical course of the cat and the finding of septate fungal hyphae on multiple biopsy samples it was elected not to pursue further testing for C. neoformans and other systemic mycoses. Although the prognosis was poor, the owner wished to attempt to aggressively pursue therapy. Despite the disease progression the cat was only partially inappetant and remained in good body condition. A complete blood count, serum biochemical analysis and routine urinalysis were still unremarkable. Therefore, a decision was made to exenterate the right orbit to alleviate ocular pain and to attempt to debulk the main fungal load in preparation for systemic antifungal therapy in the post-operative period. The cat was anesthetized using midazolam (0.25 mg/kg i.m.) and buprenorphine (15 \u03bc g/kg i.m.) for premedication, propofol (1 mg/kg i.v.) for induction and isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia. Main cardiovascular and respiratory parameters were evaluated for intra-anesthetic monitoring by using a pulse oximeter, a capnometer, an electrocardiograph, a Doppler indirect arterial blood pressure monitor and subjective clinical signs every 5 min.",

[2] [3] [4] [5] 26 All (10) of these cats had rhinitis, sinusitis and a mucopurulent nasal discharge. Epistaxis was also present in several cats. In three of the 10 cats a lymphocytic-plasmacytic rhinitis was present, but fungal hyphae were found only in one or both frontal sinuses and not in the nasal passages. Rhinoscopy in eight of the cases demonstrated white masses in the nasal cavities and/or sinuses, whereas CT (performed in seven cats) showed destruction of the turbinate bones. Two cats with sino-nasal disease also had involvement of the orbit. In one case this was associated with fungal sinusitis, 5 and in the other it was associated with fungal sinusitis and rhinitis. 4 The literature also contains another case of orbital aspergillosis in a cat in which there were no reported signs of fungal rhinitis nor sinusitis. 1 Therefore, although fungal orbital disease can be an extension of a fungal sino-nasal infection as in the case reported here, this does not appear to always be the case.",

Additionally, it is possible that Persian and Himalayan cats may have a specific breed predisposition to systemic infection with Aspergillus spp. much as is seen in young adult female German Shepherds, 27 although no sex predisposition has been reported for cats.",

Although A. fumigatus can be both a primary and an opportunistic pathogen (as well as a major allergen in humans), 29-31 extensive investigations of its genome suggest that it is able to create disease not because it possesses true virulence genes, but instead because it has distinct sets of temperature-dependent genes that allow it to survive in environments that are either thermally (e.g. at body temperature) or oxidatively stressful. 28, 29, 32, 33 In dogs, Aspergillus fungal endotoxins that are hemolytic and dermonecrotoxic 34, 35 have also been associated with a vasculitis and vascular necrosis of the submucosal vessels that leads to destruction and necrosis of the nasal mucosa and underlying turbinate bones.

It is tempting to speculate that the lower frequency of sino-aspergillosis in nonbrachycephalic cats is attributable to an initially more open nasal passageway that is more difficult to obstruct. Proliferation of mucus secreting glands in the nasal mucosa in response to chronic inflammation also may result in more mucoid nasal secretions and reduced mucociliary clearance of organisms from the nasal passages. 15 In concert, these events may create an ideal microenvironment for proliferation of bacteria and/or fungi, with resultant increased susceptibility to secondary infections. 15, 16 In the case reported here it is also possible that prior treatment with anti-inflammatory doses of systemic corticosteroids and/or three courses of broad spectrum antibiotics may have shifted the local environment towards one that favored proliferation of, and tissue invasion by, fungal elements, although the cat was off all therapy for 2 months before the clinical onset of orbital disease. Additionally, multiple biopsies of the nasal passages acquired at the first rhinoscopic examination failed to reveal fungal elements and did not demonstrate a granulomatous component to the inflammatory process at that time. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the initial samples obtained by pinch biopsy were not truly representative of the disease process at that time, as pinch biopsies could conceivably have been too superficial.",

[16] [17] [18] In humans, A. fumigatus is also regarded as a potential cause of allergic rhinitis and sinusitis. 40 In at least one study, however, the frequency of FHV-1 infections in cats with chronic rhinosinusitis was comparable to that found in a control population of cats without rhinosinusitis, and fungal organisms could not be isolated from any cat affected with rhinosinusitis. 39 Furthermore, another study of dogs with lymphoplasmocytic rhinitis found that the profile of gene expression of cytokines and chemokines with idiopathic LPR is different from that in dogs with sino-nasal aspergillosis, indicating that the majority of cases of idiopathic LPR in dogs are not likely to be cases of undiagnosed aspergillosis. [16] [17] [18] Whether this is also true for cats is unclear, as the fundamental nature of the immune response reported for cats with LPR (Th1) 41 is different from dogs with LPR (a partial Th2 response [16] [17] [18] ), although it is comparable to dogs with sino-nasal aspergillosis (Th1 [16] [17] [18] ) and nasal samples from cats positive for FHV-1 mRNA (also Th1). 41, 42 Given the above it is difficult to conclusively determine in the case reported here whether the LPR preceded colonization of the respiratory tract by A. fumigatus or whether the fungal organism initiated the LPR. The initial absence of fungi on multiple biopsy specimens, the relatively prolonged positive response to immunomodulating/ immunosuppressive (doxycycline and glucocorticoids) agents, and the shift towards a granulomatous inflammatory component on the second set of biopsies in this case, however, partially substantiate the hypothesis that in this cat the LPR occurred first.",

This plan was based on a previous report of a similarly affected cat in which posaconazole was successfully used as an adjunct to surgical exenteration. 1 Posaconazole was selected because it is a broad spectrum triazole and has been suggested to have the lowest minimal inhibitory concentration for A. fumigatus on sensitivity testing. 1 Unfortunately, the cat presented in our report died before systemic antifungal therapy could be initiated.",
