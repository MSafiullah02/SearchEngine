However, the rapid escalation of breathlessness in patients with COVID-19 who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may make this challenging.15 Severe breathlessness and respiratory disease are both known to be associated with increased hospital admissions at the end of life.16 Therefore, rapid community response may be needed to manage advanced disease in COVID-19 if people are to remain at home.",
