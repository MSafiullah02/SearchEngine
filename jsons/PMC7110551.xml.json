This event took place at a number of venues in Gaborone and drew around 2000 athletes aged 15 to 20 years, who took part in a wide range of sporting events including football, swimming, fencing, boxing, cycling, and rugby, as well as their support teams; the participants came from 51 African countries including Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. Spectator attendance was mainly from Botswana and countries in the region. At the beginning of May 2014 the Ministry of Health of Botswana was on high alert and requested that the WHO provide rapid technical support in strengthening public health capacities under the framework of the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, in the context of the expanding Ebola virus outbreak. Botswana had never previously managed cases of suspected or confirmed VHF.",

Proof of yellow fever vaccination was required as a condition of entry for travellers from yellow fever endemic countries. At the international airport in Gaborone, port health staff screened incoming travellers for fever; they were supported by a small team of medical personnel trained for the event. A small medical facility was established at the airport for the isolation of patients. While a strong national surveillance system supported by district outbreak response teams was already in place for epidemic-prone diseases, this was supplemented by a daily surveillance system for specific priority conditions pertinent to the event. Both a syndromic approach and laboratory confirmation to identify participants with an acute febrile illness were used. A daily analysis attempted to establish trends. An emergency 24-h reporting system was established for persons with suspected meningitis or VHF, and for any outbreaks.",

Since Botswana did not have laboratory capacity for VHF and other specialized testing, arrangements were made for testing to be conducted in the biosafety level 4 (BSL4) laboratory and reference laboratories at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, approximately 4 h by road from Gaborone. The requisite export permits and transport arrangements were facilitated. The public health and hospital laboratories in Gaborone were able to test for malaria and meningitis and common pathogens.

Persons with early or acute EVD are less likely to travel and unlikely to take part in a sporting event. Exit screening was introduced after the declaration of EVD as a PHEIC, and transmission requires direct contact with blood and body fluids of infected persons.18 However, EVD was spread to a number of countries through travel,19 persons are asymptomatic during the incubation period, sexual transmission by survivors is now well documented,20 and certain contact sports may pose a risk, albeit small, for transmission.",

These conditions included trypanosomiasis, meningococcal disease, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Lassa fever, dengue, arboviral infections, and leptospirosis, as well as the more familiar typhoid, malaria, hepatitis (A, B, and E), HIV, sexually transmitted infections, tuberculosis, and gastrointestinal (viral and bacterial) and respiratory infections, including influenza.

The unexplained rapid spread of the mosquito-borne ZIKV across South and Central America adds another viral threat (in addition to dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever) for the attendees of the Olympic Games, further challenging preparedness and surveillance efforts. South Africa successfully hosted two mass gatherings during the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus PHEIC without any major communicable disease incidents. These were the Confederation Cup in 2009 and the Fifa Soccer World Cup in 2010. While epidemics due to vector-borne transmission pose different challenges to Ebola virus and influenza, the same principles of enhancing surveillance and response efforts and reducing all possible risks would apply.",
