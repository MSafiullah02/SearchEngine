Gut microbiota has a significant role in host metabolism and homeostasis [2, 3]. A disturbance in this microbial community, which leads to an unhealthy state, is called dysbiosis [4]. Over the past decade, emerging evidence has demonstrated the role of intestinal dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of various conditions, such as infectious, immune, and metabolic diseases [5], while it has not been studied extensively in critical illness. An extreme and persistent dysbiosis occurs among critically ill patients, regardless of the heterogeneity of disease. The extreme dysbiosis in patients under critical care is due to the stress of critical illness, multiple antibiotics and additional pharmacological interventions, and highly processed enteral/parenteral nutrition [6, 7]. Dysbiosis in critically ill patients may make them prone to hospital-acquired infections, sepsis, multi-organ failure (MOF), energy homeostasis disturbance, muscle wasting, and cachexia [6, 8, 9].",

            "text": "The majority of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) have had a severe illness, trauma, or major surgery, and accordingly they are unable to manage their nutritional demands. Although nutritional support is a daily practice in the ICU, many patients still suffer from malnutrition due to lack of intake or uptake of nutrients [10]. The prevalence of malnutrition in the ICU within developed and developing countries is reported as 50.8% and 78.1%, respectively [11]. Malnutrition is independently associated with longer ICU stay, more ICU readmissions, and a higher incidence of infections and risk of mortality [11]. A greater degree of malnutrition is also associated with a higher risk of 28-day mortality [12]. Malnutrition further tends toward acute or chronic loss of muscle bulk and function [13]. The gut microbiota and their derived metabolites play an essential role in the absorption, storage, and consumption of energy derived from the diet [14, 15]. Previous studies suggest that modulating gut microbiota by novel therapeutics, such as prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics, can have an effect on gastrointestinal tolerance and complications of enteral nutrition, which eventually lead to the regulation of energy intake. Recently, Tuncay et al. showed that enteric formula with prebiotic content in patients under neurocritical care was associated with a significant increase in total feed volume and energy intake and a non-significant tendency to achieve a target dose of nutrition more frequently and earlier [16]. Malik et al. also found that in patients in the ICU, receiving enteral formula supplemented with probiotics led to a faster return of gut function (tolerated feeding of 80% of their estimated required calories for 48 h consecutively) [17]. However, Sanaie et al. demonstrated that daily energy and protein intake in patients receiving probiotic supplements on the ICU were not significantly different from the group receiving placebo [18]. In the critical care setting, diarrhea is the most obvious complication of enteral nutrition (EN), which is associated with the inadequacy of energy and macronutrient intake [16]. Previous systematic reviews have confirmed the significant benefit of probiotics in the reduction of diarrhea in hospital patients overall. But a recent meta-analysis focused on patients in the ICU found no benefit of probiotics in preventing or treating diarrhea [19]. Besides, in the dysbiosis state of critical illness, microbial products that reach distant organs like brain, adipose tissue, and liver, favor the development of immune-mediated diseases and metabolic alterations [20]. Gut microbiota metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) can also influence the immune system and host metabolism, which regulates energy homeostasis [20]. Thus, gut microbiota modulation may be beneficial in the regulation of immune and metabolic responses and energy homeostasis.",

Gut microbiota influence amino acid bioavailability and are sources of different metabolites, such as conjugated linoleic acid, acetate, and bile acids, which modulate muscle metabolism [8]. Various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) activate the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) through toll-like receptors (TLRs) and modulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which can induce muscle atrophy [8] (Fig. 1).\n",

In another study, Bindels et al. showed that prebiotic supplementation in leukemic mice could contribute to delaying anorexia and fat mass sparing by inducing a metabolic shift in adipose tissue [23]. In the mouse models of cancer cachexia, administration of a synbiotic supplement including inulin-type fructans and live L. reuteri 100\u201323 was associated with restoration of the gut barrier and immune function, thus reducing cachexia.

According to the recent European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN) guideline on clinical nutrition in the ICU [26], continuous rather than bolus EN is preferred because it causes less diarrhea, but there is no difference in other outcomes. Another systematic review showed that bolus feeding is associated with lower aspiration rate and better calorie attainment [27]. It also provides a greater stimulus for protein synthesis [28]. Considering these data and the availability of bolus EN in our hospitals we applied this method. In the absence of an indirect calorimeter, the simple weight-based equation of 20\u201325 Kcal/kg/day in the acute flow phase and 25\u201330 Kcal/kg/day in the anabolic flow phase is preferred for measurement of calorie requirements.

Delayed peristalsis can increase bacterial translocation out of the GI tract [31].\n3.H2 receptor blockers\nPrevention of GI tract (GIT) stress ulcers, through H2 receptor blockers or proton-pump inhibitors, is common in critical care practice. Increase in GI acidity can cause overgrowth of some pathogenic bacteria [32].\n4.Catecholamines\nIt is believed that the elevated level of catecholamines in patients under critical care, as prescribed exogenously beside endogenous production, can impair the immune system [33].",

            "text": "The primary outcomes are\nEnergy homeostasis (calorie intake-estimated calorie requirement)Protein catabolism (nitrogen balance)\nNitrogen balance is a measure of the net change in total body protein. It is the difference between nitrogen eliminated from the body and nitrogen ingested in the diet. A positive or neutral nitrogen balance shows that protein stores are increased or maintained, while a negative nitrogen balance indicates protein mass is decreasing. The practical method for estimating nitrogen balance supposes that total nitrogen loss is equal to urinary urea nitrogen excretion plus 4 g/day additional loss from non-urinary urea nitrogen, gastrointestinal, and insensible losses [36, 37]. To measure the nitrogen balance, during the 24-h urine collection, the total intake of protein will be recorded to calculate nitrogen intake: 24-h urine samples will be immediately delivered to the laboratory to measure urea nitrogen.\n3.Muscle protein degradation (3-methyl histidine (3MH) in 24-h urine)\n3MH is exclusively found in muscle proteins, and after protein degradation, it is rapidly excreted in the urine without further reutilization or metabolization. So, measuring urinary 3MH, after at least 1 day of a meat-free diet, can be used as a biomarker of muscle protein breakdown [38, 39]. After a 1-day meat-free diet, 24-h urine will be collected. Urine samples will be centrifuged for 20 min at 1000\u00d7g. The supernatant will be collected and stored at \u2212 70 \u00b0C for a maximum of 2 months. The ELISA method will be used for 3MH detection.\n4.Muscle protein turnover (3MH/creatinine ratio in 24-h urine)\nSince 24-h urinary creatinine estimates the total pool of muscle proteins, muscle protein turnover can be calculated from the 3MH/creatinine excretion ratio [38]. A 24-h urine sample will be delivered to the laboratory to immediately measure creatinine by the enzymatic method.\n5.Lipolysis (free glycerol in serum)\nFree glycerol is an important index of lipid metabolism. When the body uses stored fat as the energy supply, glycerol and fatty acids are released into the circulation. The absence of glycerol kinase in the adipocyte decreases triacylglycerol resynthesize and supports hepatic gluconeogenesis [40]. After obtaining the overnight fasting blood sample, the serum will be separated. The serum sample will be stored at \u2212 70 \u00b0C for further measurement of free glycerol by enzymatic colorimetric method.\n6.Glucose homeostasis (fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin)7.Inflammatory status (CRP, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR))\nNLR is an available measurable marker used to measure systemic inflammation.\n8.Dysbiosis status and luminal integrity (endotoxin levels)\nIntestinal gram-negative bacteria are the major source of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are referred to as endotoxins. In the case of reduced intestinal barrier integrity due to dysbiosis, luminal endotoxins can enter the circulation [41]. Endotoxin activity assay (EAA) will be used to determine endotoxin levels in whole blood.",

They have a major role in the absorption, storage, and consumption of energy derived from the diet [14, 15]. Outside the intestine, they also modulate cell metabolism, energy homeostasis, systemic inflammation, appetite and food intake [42, 43] . On the other hand, a few clinical studies, modulating gut microbiota in patients under critical care demonstrated a faster return of gut function and earlier achievement of the nutritional target dose [16, 17]. Therefore, we expect that our patients in the intervention group will have a better enteric feeding tolerance and also more desirable energy homeostasis.",

The underlying mechanisms remain to be identified. Gut microbiota influence amino acid bioavailability and are a source of different metabolites such as conjugated linoleic acid, acetate, and bile acids that modulate muscle metabolism. Gut microbiota are also a source of PAMPs, which activate the transcription factor NF-kB through toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cause muscle wasting. Gut microbiota also modulate production of proinflammatory cytokines, which can induce muscle atrophy [8]. We expect that synbiotic intervention in patients under critical care reduces muscle protein degradation and turnover. As malnutrition and muscle wasting in these patients are associated with negative health outcomes, gut microbiota modulation will improve the clinical prognosis and reduce infectious complications, ventilator dependency, and length of ICU stay.",
