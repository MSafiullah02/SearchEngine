It is estimated that, from 1981 to 2006, anti-infective agents based on natural product scaffolds accounted for up to 75% of all approved antibacterial new chemical entities (NCEs), thus attesting for the importance of natural products as the main source of therapeutics against pathogenic bacteria [2]. In this context, microorganisms, notably members of the Gram-positive phylum Actinomycetes, have been the workhouse source of clinically approved antibacterial agents. The high diversity of candidate molecules extracted from microorganisms frequently leads to the discovery of new compounds with distinct mechanisms of action compared with drugs currently used for clinical purposes. However, in recent years, the traditional screening of drug candidates belonging to completely new antibacterial classes from microbial sources has suffered a considerable decline, mostly because of the presence of numerous, already well-characterized, molecules [3].",

These molecules are versatile, highly specific antimicrobial compounds that constitute promising candidates for commercial and clinical uses. AMPs are essential components of the innate immune system of vertebrates and the nonspecific host defense system of plants, fungi, and invertebrates that evolved over 2.6 billion years ago as potent anti-infective agents against different viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. These small peptides usually comprise 10\u201350 amino acid residues and are 2\u20139 kDa in size [1]. Commonly, they show a cationic structure rich in positively charged arginine and lysine residues, which favors the interaction between these peptides and microbial cytoplasmic membranes. However, although less common, there are also anionic AMPs, notably in plants. AMPs usually kill pathogens by interacting with membrane phospholipids, resulting in membrane permeabilization and subsequent disruption. These peptides also show different secondary structures, such as \u03b2-sheets stabilized by two or three disulfide bridges and often display a helical amphipathic structure 1, 2, 3.",

The driving force of such interaction is the electrostatic force presented by the AMP, which is normally cationic, and the polyanionic surface of bacteria 5, 11. Differences in the cell wall composition among bacterial groups affect directly the mode of action of AMPs. Gram-negative bacteria present three major layers in the cell envelope: (i) the outer membrane (OM), comprising a lipid bilayer, mostly of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interlaced by teichoic acid, which has a major role in protection against the environment; (ii) the peptidoglycan cell wall, comprising repeated units of a disaccharide (N-acetyl glucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid) linked by pentapeptide side chains; and (iii) the cytoplasmic membrane\u2013phospholipid bilayer.

The active PhoP activates pagP, which encodes a resistance enzyme against AMPs; mgtA, encoding a transporter of Mg2+; and hdeA, encoding a chaperone responsive to acidic conditions.

These modifications in lipid A are also induced by the PhoQ/PhoP system and appear to be closely related to cationic AMP resistance, mainly against polymyxin B, in Gram-negative bacteria. Glycosylation of lipid A was recently reported as another lipid modification that results in polymyxin resistance in EI Tor Vibrio cholerae\n[22]. The addition of glycine to lipid A is regulated by the almEFG operon, which controls the expression of several proteins (AImE, AlmF, and AlmG) related to glycine activation and transfer to lipid A. Glycine is activated by adenylation by AlmE, which transfers active glycine to the 4\u2032-phosphopantetheine group of AlmF. Once active, AlmF donates the glycine to the hydroxylauryl chain of lipid A, a transfer reaction performed by AlmG [22].",

Biofilm-producing bacteria can resist many different antibiotics. Biofilm-mediated resistance results mainly from extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), a liquid comprising mainly amyloid and adhesive fimbriae, extracellular DNA, and exopolysaccharides that embeds multiple cells throughout the biofilm matrix [26]. The EPS extracellular DNA of P. aeruginosa can induce resistance against polymyxin B and colistin in response to the chelating of environmental cations.

Most surface glycans are post-translationally added in the Golgi after the peptide has passed through the secretory pathway [39]. Plant-derived AMPs are the main primary targets for glycosylation engineering that aims to improve biological activity against phytopathogens and to humanize glycosylation for clinical use in humans. Plant N-glycans differ considerably from those in mammals. Typically, mammalian \u03b11,6 fucose (N-acetylglucosamine of the core), \u03b21,4N-acetylglucosamine (\u03b2-mannose of the core), and \u03b21,4 galactose combined with sialic acid and linked to the terminal N-acetylglucosamine are substituted in plants, by an \u03b11,3 fucose, a bisecting \u03b21,2 xylose, and a \u03b21,3 galactose and fucose \u03b11,4-linked to the terminal N-acetylglucosamine, respectively 40, 41. Another important issue concerning the humanization of AMP glycosylation is avoiding the addition of allergenic glycoepitopes to the peptide surface, because humans are frequently allergic to plant \u03b11,3 fucose and \u03b22 xylose. Currently, the main efforts to minimize undesirable plant glycosylation of AMPs rely on avoiding the complete transit throughout the secretory pathway by confining peptides inside the endoplasmic reticulum, using N- or C-terminal retention signals, such as KDEL. Advances in the humanization of the glycosylation of proteins (i.e. the full substitution of non-mammalian host N-linked glycans for typical human glycans by knocking down plant xylosyl and fucosyltransferases and yeast mannosidases and expression of human glycosidases) is already a reality in the production of plant and yeast antibodies and interferons, but has not yet been fully applied to AMPs 41, 42.",

This methodology provides standard protocols for the isolation, characterization, and purification of peptides. Solid-phase synthesis provides platforms for the production of large and structurally complex peptides on a large scale. The hybrid method combines characteristics of the two previous methodologies. Although efficient for the production of active peptides, the three approaches are expensive because they enable prolonged times for amino acid polymerization, a drawback that is particularly important during early clinical studies because it can invalidate economically the manufacturing of the peptides 2, 54, 55, 56.",

The process is based on the infiltration of whole plants with a suspension of transgenic Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells carrying plasmids that encode viral RNAs replicons (Fig. 2\n). These Gram-negative soil bacteria have key roles in infection and movement throughout plant tissues because they systemically spread through the plant to eventually reach most leaves and stems 8, 63. Infiltrated plants contain viral vectors based on tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) or potato virus X (PVX) carrying AMP-coding sequences, delivered by bacteria to be transiently expressed and amplified [64].

Here, we describe previous molecular tools based on the repair of artificially generated DNA DSBs.\nZinc finger nucleases\nZinc finger nucleases (ZNFs) are genetically engineered DNA-binding proteins utilized for the easy editing of the genome. They create DSBs at user-specified locations. ZFNs present two functional domains. The first is a DNA-binding domain with two-finger modules for DNA hexamer (6-bp) recognition. These two-fingered modules stitch together to produce the zinc finger proteins, which are capable of recognizing and specifically binding to a \u226524-bp DNA extension. The second domain is a nuclease FokI DNA-cleavage domain that, once fused to the DNA-binding domain, forms a molecular scissor that catalyzes phosphodiester disruption. When used together, two ZFNs can produce DSBs that are targets for precise genomic edits by natural DNA repair processes, such as homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).\nPros of ZFNs for genome editing\n\u2022Provide rapid DNA disruption of, and/or integration into, any genomic loci.\u2022Functional in a range of mammalian somatic cell types.\u2022Edit genomes through a single transfection round of DNA repair.\u2022Screening dispenses antibiotics.\n\nCons of ZFNs for genomic editing\n\u2022Screening and assembly is technically challenging.\u2022Typically binds to short 9\u201318-bp sequences.\u2022Replacement of fragments longer than 1 kb is difficult.\u2022Off-target effects.\u2022Target events in animals require screening.\n\nTranscription activator-like effector nucleases\nTranscription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are a class of proteins recent found exclusively in the plant pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas. TALEs comprises a DNA-binding domain of 33\u201335 conserved amino acid repeat motifs organized in tandem arrays that individually recognizes a specific nucleotide of target DNA. TALE repeats provide two adjacent amino acids, named repeat-variable-di-residue (RVD), that specifically bind to a nucleotide, and can be arranged in different combinations according to the sequence that must be recognized in the target DNA. A new type of engineered TALE repeats presents a C-terminal FokI endonuclease domain, constituting a TALE nuclease (TALEN). TALEN are similar to ZFNs, providing DSBs when grouped in pairs after binding to DNA with high affinity.\nPros of TALENs for genome editing\n\u2022Easier to design compared with ZFNs.\u2022Bind 18-bp or longer sequences.\u2022Fewer constraints on site location.\n\nCons of TALENs for genome editing\n\u2022Larger than ZFNs (coded usually by 3-kb DNA).\u2022Evidence that larger TALENs can lead to less specificity.\u2022Off-target effects.\n\nCRISPRs\nCRISPRs are recently discovered bacterial adaptive immune systems that use a combination of short RNAs and associated proteins to target specific sequences of DNA for the generation of DSBs. CRISPRs revolutionized genome editing standards by presenting several technical advantages compared with previous systems, although they still have some disadvantages.\nPros of CRISPRs for genome editing\n\u2022Easily adapted system to target and modify any genomic sequence.\u2022The Cas9 protein, the main protein for DNA recognition and cleavage, remains unchanged for any CRISPRs.\u2022Easy to use to target numerous sites or across genomic libraries.\u2022Use of multiplex-based guide RNAs to simultaneously edit multiple sites.\n\nCons of CRISPRs for genome editing\n\u2022Size of Cas9 (cDNA approximately 4.2 kb).\n",

DSBs are targets of the imprecise cellular repair machineries either mediated by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homology directed repair (HDR), which require a donor DNA template [98]. CRISPRs constitute an incredibly versatile genome-editing platform derived from the S. pyogenes CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) 67, 68. There are three types of CRISPRs. Type II is the simplest, presented only by bacteria and comprises four proteins (i.e. Cas1, Cas2, Cas9, and Cas4); it is the most widely used system for gene engineering. The most popular CRISPR\u2013Cas system is constituted by Cas9 endonuclease proteins and CRISPR RNAs [68]. The nuclease Cas9 can catalyze the precise cleavage of target sites assisted by two short helper RNAs: cRNA and tracRNA. The fusion of both RNAs forms a hybrid single guide RNA (sgRNA) that binds to Cas9 to form a supramolecular complex named RNA-guided endonuclease, a sequence-specific recognizer complex that cleaves at specific sites in the genome, resulting in DSBs that are then repaired preferentially by HDR (in the case of bacterial genomes), thus altering the genome in a precise manner by site-specific modifications [69].",

The emergence of MDR bacteria is a tremendous global health problem that has been predicted to lead to the death of 10 million humans per year by 2050 [73]. Microbes, plants, and animals are natural sources of therapeutic drugs and could also be a source of novel, biologically inspired, previously unknown antibiotics for human applications. In addition to their obvious importance, novel AMPs with high anti-infective properties are difficult to prospect and are naturally synthesized only at low levels in their respective host organisms. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase the efficiency and final yield of peptides during their production to allow their economic exploitation.",

An extra small RNA (tracrRNA) complementary to the repeat sequence is also synthesized. (c) The tracrRNA pairs with the repeated region of crRNA and helps in the processing of pre-crRNA into crRNA with the help of RNAse III for cleavage. Interference stage: crRNAS binds to Ca proteins (d) to form a complex that recognizes foreign DNA (e). A single multifunctional protein, Cas9, recruits crRNA and tracrRNA to cleave the recognized foreign DNA using internal endonuclease domains (f). All the process is based in the recognition and pairing of the PAM and the foreign DNA. Double strand breaks (DSBs) are generated (g).
