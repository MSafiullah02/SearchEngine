Hence, it is crucial to identify individuals who are susceptible to developing severe COVID-19 and could require hospitalisation, especially in the ICU.",

            "text": "Evidence is emerging that obesityrelated conditions seem to worsen the effect of the virus. Studies from Chinese cohorts of patients with COVID-19 have identified several risk factors of severe COVID-19 including age, cardiomyopathy, and obesityrelated complications such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. 3 However, to our knowledge, only few studies so far have included information regarding the BMI of patients with COVID-19, which suggest a high prevalence of obesity in patients with severe COVID-19. [4] [5] [6] [7] Data from New York City suggest that obesity, as defined by BMI of at least 30 kg/m2, might be a risk factor for ICU admission among patients with COVID-19, especially among those younger than 60 years. 8 Additionally, preliminary analyses from Lille University Hospital have reported differences in BMI distribution in ICU patients with COVID-19 compared with ICU patients without COVID-19. 7 Given the growing epidemic of COVID-19 in countries such as the USA, UK, and Mexico that have a high prevalence of obesity, there is an urgent need to clarify the relationship between obesity and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to assess the prevalence of obesity, as defined by BMI of at least 30 kg/m2, among patients requiring hospitalisation for severe COVID-19, including those with critical COVID-19 admitted to an ICU.",

Given the dual pandemics of COVID-19 and obesity in high-income countries, our findings have major implications for the clinical care of patients with obesity and COVID-19, as well as for public health interest. Further independent multicentre studies including longitudinal assessment of outcomes such as duration of hospitalisation and mortality are needed to confirm that obesity is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, and further analyses are planned on our datasets once follow-up is complete. These findings can help clinicians to better identify specific populations with higher risk of severe disease, which could lead to an increase in protective measures, proposal of serological screening for immunisation, and recommendation of a vaccination once available for people with obesity.",

However, this cross-sectional study did not capture other possible confounding factors such as viral load, biological data, socioeconomic factors, or other obesity-related comorbidities such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Additionally, this study does not include any longitudinal follow-up as several patients are still hospitalised. Some patients in the non-ICU group might yet require ICU admission.
