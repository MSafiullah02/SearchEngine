            "text": "More and more, asset management organizations are introducing data science initiatives to support the digital transformation of their business processes [1]. However, in order for data science to be successful, it is vital that asset management organizations are able to trust the integrity of the digital environment [2, 3]. Managers have, in the past, found it difficult to trust data science products as, for example, the data is often found to be lacking the required quality [4\u20137]. Furthermore, as suggested by Wallis et al. [7], data collections are only as valuable as the data they contain, and users need to be able to trust the data based on the integrity of the data systems and the intrinsic quality of the data. Managers need to be able to trust data science products before they are confident enough to use these products to support their business processes to make crucial decisions [6]. Examples of these decisions in the asset management domain are maintaining dykes or replacing a bridge. Decisions in these scenarios have long term implications and wrong decisions can be expensive and risky. A lack of trust in data science projects can often be attributed to the lack of data quality, and the success of data science projects is often highly reliant on the quality of the data being used [8\u201310]. There is no single factor defining the successful outcomes of a data science project [11, 12], but recently data governance has gained traction by many organizations as being important for ensuring quality and compliance in data science outcomes [11, 13]. However, it remains unclear how data governance contributes to the success of data science outcomes, leading to calls for more research in this area [11, 14, 15].",

This paper analyses a case study in the asset management domain with specific regard for the role of data governance as success factor for data science outcomes. The case under study is managed by Rijkswaterstaat in the Netherlands. Rijkswaterstaat is part of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management and is responsible for the design, construction, management and maintenance of the main infrastructure facilities in the Netherlands. The paper reads as follows. Section 2 presents the background of literature regarding the relationship between data governance, trust and the digital environment. In Sect. 3 the methodology of the research is described. Section 4 describes the findings of the case study. Section 5 discusses the findings of the case study and Sect. 6 presents the conclusions.",

According to Provost and Fawcett [1] (p. 52), data science is \u201ca set of fundamental principles that support and guide the principled extraction of information and knowledge from data\u201d. From this perspective, data science encompasses a broad range of knowledge and capabilities such as data-mining and machine learning, which are designed to extract knowledge from data and are important for creating value and moderating risk in data science initiatives. As such, data governance can help organizations make use of data as a competitive asset [21, 23]. Data governance aims at maximizing the value of data assets in enterprises [1, 37]. For example, capturing electric- and gas-usage data every few minutes benefits the consumer as well as the provider of energy. With active governance of big data, isolation of faults and quick fixing of issues can prevent systemic energy grid collapse [38].",

Data science initiatives such as predictive maintenance modelling generally require big data [10, 30, 31]. Asset management organizations often choose to implement data lakes using a variety of architectures and technologies to store big data and to make this data available for use. A data lake is \u201ca central repository system for storage, processing, and analysis of raw data, in which the data is kept in its original format and is processed to be queried only when needed\u201d [32] (p. 456). Data lakes are different to traditional data warehouses which often have their own native formats and structures as data is stored in its original, raw, format [33, 34]. Often, the data processing systems which are required to allow the data to be ingested without compromising the data structure are also included in the definition [32, 34]. The data in the data lake is generally immediately accessible, allowing users to utilize dynamic analytical applications [34, 35]. This immediate accessibility, as well as the retaining of data in its original format presents a number of challenges regarding management of the data lake, including data quality management, data security and access control [33, 36], as well as in maintaining compliance with regards to privacy [21, 36]. As such, data governance has increasingly gained popularity as a means of ensuring data quality and maintaining compliance.",

According to Saha and Srivastava [40], the massive volumes, high velocity and large variety of automatically generated data can lead to serious data quality management issues which can be difficult to manage in a timely manner [41]. For example, IoT sensors calibrated to measure the salinity of water may, over time, begin to provide incorrect values due to biofouling. Data science information products often rely on near real-time data to provide timely alerts, and, as such, problems may arise if these data quality issues are not timely detected and corrected.",

For example, Panian [43] states that establishing and enforcing policies and processes around the management of data should be the foundation of effective data governance practice as using big data for data science often raises ethical concerns. Automatic data collection may cause privacy infringements [44, 45] such as cameras used to track traffic on highways which often record personally identifiable data such as number plates or faces of persons in the vehicles. Data governance processes should ensure that these personally identifiable features are removed before data is shared or used for purposes other than legally allowed. Data governance should therefore establish what specific data privacy policies are appropriate [39] and applicable across the organization [38]. For example, Tallon [46] states that organizations have a social and legal responsibility to safeguard personal data, whilst Power and Trope [47] suggest that risks and threats to data and privacy require diligent attention from organizations.",

Case study is a widely adopted method for examining contemporary phenomenon such as the adoption of data governance [49, 50]. In this research we analyze a single case, following the design of an explanatory case study research proposed by Yin [51], including the research question, the propositions for research, the unit of analysis, and the logic linking the data to the propositions. Single case study was selected as being appropriate for this research as there is a need to investigate data governance as success factor for data science in greater detail. In this regard, single case studies may be more appropriate than multiple case studies, as a single case study provides the opportunity to have a deeper understanding of data governance in a specific context [51, 52], in this case, data science efforts in the asset management domain. As suggested by Eisenhardt [50], the research was contextualized by a review of background literature, identifying the generally accepted roles of data governance in a data science context. The literature background reveals data science initiatives often face a number of challenges, and not all efforts lead to successful outcomes [15, 48, 53]. Facing these challenges has led many organizations to adopt data governance as a means of improving the outcomes of data science efforts [13]. However, data governance remains a poorly understood concept [22, 36] and its contribution to the success of data science has not been widely researched [36]. As discussed above, our main research question therefore asks how does data governance contribute to more successful data science outcomes?",

RWS has a spend of approximately \u20ac200 million per annum on asphalt maintenance, with operational parameters traditionally focused on traffic safety. In the past this has led to increasing overspend due either to premature maintenance, or to expensive emergency repairs. The prediction of asphalt lifetime based on traditional parameters has been shown to be correct one third of the time. RWS is seeking to reduce these costs by extending the lifespan of asphalt where possible whilst reducing the number of emergency repairs made by adopting data science techniques for the purpose of predictive, \u201cjust-in-time\u201d maintenance. Using available big data in a more detailed manner, such as raveling data collected by a Laser Crack Measurement System combined with Weigh-in-Motion data has doubled the prediction consistency. According to RWS officials, improving the accuracy of asphalt lifetime prediction has enabled better maintenance planning which has significantly reduced premature maintenance, improving road safety and cost savings, and reducing the environmental impact due to reduced traffic congestion and a reduction in CO2 emissions. The data science model uses data related to traditional inspections, historical data generated during the laying of the asphalt, road attribute data and planning data, as well automatically generated, streaming data such as weather data, traffic data, and IoT sensor data. The current model takes about 400 parameters into consideration. According to an RWS official, \u201cthis number will only grow, as the (project partners) continue to supply new data\u201d.

RWS staff members have suggested that, in the past, a significant amount of production time has often been lost due to inadequate data quality. The RWS data quality management process follows an eight step process which begins by identifying: 1. the data to be produced, 2. the value of the data for the RWS primary processes, and 3. a data owner. RWS has developed an automatic auditing tool (AAT) in combination with a Manual Auditing Tool (MAT) to monitor the quality of the data as a product in order to further improve its grip on data quality. According to RWS staff, the AAT and the MAT ensured that quality measurements were mutually comparable, provided tools for more focused management, and caused a change in the conscious use of data as a strategic asset. Alongside with the AAT, the MAT is considered important as it is not yet possible to automate the monitoring of all data quality dimensions. Data quality measuring is centralized at RWS, the goal being to ensure a standardized working method. However, RWS maintained the policy that every data owner is responsible for improvements to the data management process and the data itself. The RWS data quality framework was based on fitness for use and data quality measurement was maintained according to 8 main dimensions and 47 subdimensions.",

The objective of the case study is to understand the role of data governance as success factor for data science. The case under study is a data science project which predicts the maintenance requirements of asphalt on national highways over time. Three propositions were defined on the basis of existing theory on data governance, namely: 1. defining clear roles and responsibilities for data management will result in easier generation of business value from data science efforts, 2. monitoring and managing data quality will result in more useful outcomes from data science efforts, and 3. compliance monitoring and control is a required condition for data science. These propositions were derived from the literature and confirmed in the case study, suggesting that data governance should be regarded as an important success factor for data science outcomes. The results show that clearly defined ownership of the data, monitoring the quality of the data entering the data lake, and a controlled overview of compliance requirements are important factors for successful data science outcomes. The results also show that efficient management of compliance may be performed by developing centrally managed, standardized solutions for privacy and security requirements. However, system-specific compliance requirements need to be developed by data managers and these requirements should be owned by a business sponsor who assumes responsibility for these requirements. As such, the results show the data governance is an important success factor for data science outcomes as it ensures that data quality and compliance are effectively managed.",
