            "text": "Recent findings have demonstrated that three major systems: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and DNA sensors, including cGAS and IFI16, function as key sensors that recognize viral nucleic acids and trigger the induction of type I interferon (IFN) in the human body (Kawai and Akira, 2011; Yoneyama et al., 2015; Cai et al., 2014; Jakobsen and Paludan, 2014). The transfection of exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), typically the synthetic dsRNA, poly I:poly C, is known to induce IFN in a TLR-independent fashion. Therefore, cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors had been proposed to detect invading and replicating viruses. The cytoplasmic RNA helicase RIG-I was identified in 2004 as a viral sensor belonging to a family of three RLR members: RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 (Yoneyama et al., 2004, Yoneyama et al., 2005; Rothenfusser et al., 2005). A fragment containing the N-terminus portion of RIG-I was identified by expression cloning and found to contain two tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), essential domains for signal transduction (Yoneyama et al., 2004). RLRs are located in the cytoplasm, and their expression is basally sustained at a low level. Upon infection, RLRs trigger antiviral IFN responses by the recognition of viral RNAs, and the IFN produced highly upregulates the expression of RLRs for the efficient sensing and amplification of antiviral signaling.",

This helicase domain is also known to have the potential to unwind dsRNA; however, RNA unwinding per se does not transduce signaling (Marques et al., 2006), instead its ATP hydrolysis has been implicated in conformational changes associated with dsRNA binding (Jiang et al., 2011). Detailed structural studies of RIG-I have recently revealed that a central DExD/H-box core is comprised of two RecA-like folds, designated Hel-1 and Hel-2, with the latter containing an insertion of Hel-2i that facilitates the recognition of dsRNA (Kowalinski et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2011; Civril et al., 2011). Recent studies also identified a novel Pincer domain (also designated as a bridging domain) composed of two alpha helices physically tethering the CTD to the helicase core (Kowalinski et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2011). In spite of its pronounced influence on the structure of RIG-I, few studies have examined the functional significance of the Pincer region with regard to ligand binding, allosteric regulation, and helicase and ATPase activities as well as the signaling activities of RIG-I (Kageyama et al., 2011).",

Although LGP2 lacks the CARD for its own signal transduction, a loss-of-function analysis revealed that it acted as a positive regulator of RLR signaling (Satoh et al., 2010). The importance of the ATPase activity of LGP2 in positive regulation was also demonstrated using knock-in mice with the LGP2 gene without ATPase activity (Satoh et al., 2010). The mechanisms underlying positive regulation have been suggested to increase the affinities of RIG-I and MDA5 to their ligands, dsRNA (Bruns et al., 2014; Pippig et al., 2009); however, the precise mechanisms have not yet been determined.",

            "text": "RLR is expressed ubiquitously and promotes antiviral responses upon viral infection. Loss-of-function experiments revealed that RIG-I and MDA5 sensed a different spectrum of viral infections in vivo and in cell cultures, as summarized in Figure 2\n(Kato et al., 2005, Kato et al., 2006; Gitlin et al., 2006). For example, RIG-I was found to be essential for the recognition of various types of RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Sendai virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus, whereas MDA5 preferentially recognized specific types of RNA viruses, including encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Theiler's virus, and the mengovirus of Picornaviridae (Kato et al., 2005, Kato et al., 2006; Sumpter et al., 2005). Some viruses including West Nile virus, dengue virus, and reovirus are recognized by both RIG-I and MDA5 (Fredericksen et al., 2008; Kato et al., 2008; Loo et al., 2008). This differential recognition by RIG-I and MDA5 has mostly been attributed to the distinct RNA structures produced by different viruses (Figure 2; Kato et al., 2006; Hornung et al., 2006; Pichlmair et al., 2006; Rehwinkel et al., 2010). For example, the genomic RNA of IAV, which contains a 5\u2032ppp- and dsRNA-containing panhandle structure, was shown to efficiently activate RIG-I (Rehwinkel et al., 2010; Pichlmair et al., 2006). In the case of EMCV infection, long dsRNAs, generated as replication intermediates, strongly activated MDA5 (Kato et al., 2008). The short dsRNA (\u223c2 kbp) of the reovirus genome with 5\u2032pp was previously reported to activate RIG-I, whereas dsRNAs over 2 kbp of the reovirus activated MDA5 (Kato et al., 2008; Goubau et al., 2014). A high-order RNA structure is also known to be a requirement for the activation of MDA5 (Pichlmair et al., 2009). Host mRNA and tRNA both lack 5\u2032ppp- or 5\u2032pp signatures and the long dsRNA stretch, and, thus, escape detection by RLR, which indicates the significance of the 5\u2032 signature and/or length of dsRNA for the activation of RLR (Schlee et al., 2009; Kato et al., 2008). Sequence specificity for the activation of RLR such as the uridine-rich region in the 3\u2032UTR of HCV genome RNA has also been suggested (Saito et al., 2008). In some cases, RLR ligands were found to be produced by host enzymes including polymerase III and RNase L. Previous studies demonstrated that the artificial transfection of AT dsDNA triggered RIG-I-dependent IFN signaling and also that AT dsDNA was transcribed by RNA polymerase III to generate 5\u2032ppp-AU RNA (Ablasser et al., 2009; Chiu et al., 2009). However, its physiological significance in viral infection is not well established. Small RNAs produced from the cleavage of both viral and host RNAs by RNase L have been implicated as ligands for RIG-I and MDA5 (Malathi et al., 2007). These cleavage products were shown to possess 5\u2032 OH and 3\u2032 monophosphate, and the latter was shown to be critical for the activation of RLR (Malathi et al., 2010).",

In this direct binding, RIG-I undergoes a prominent conformational change: the CTD binds tightly to 5\u2032ppp or the blunt ends of 5\u2032 OH dsRNA and the helicase domains (Hel-1, Hel-II, Hel-IIi) wrap around dsRNA, leading to a more compact composition (Takahasi et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2010, Lu et al., 2011). In spite of having a similar domain structure to that of RIG-I, MDA5 has been identified as a crystal structure that binds to dsRNA in a somewhat different manner. The helicase domain of MDA5 wraps around dsRNA and the CTD also forms a contact with Hel-1; thus, MDA5 forms a closed ringlike structure around dsRNA. These conformational alterations in RLRs result in the exposure of CARD. Since a mutation at the ATP-binding site (Walker's A motif) was previously shown to inactivate these sensors, the ATPase activities of RIG-I and MDA5 may be involved in these conformational changes. In this step, K63-linked polyubiquitin on K172 and K788 by TRIM25 and Riplet, respectively, was found to promote and stabilize the oligomerization of RIG-I CARDs (Gack et al., 2007; Oshiumi et al., 2010).",

MAVS is localized on the mitochondrial outer membrane; therefore, RLR signaling from the cytosol is transmitted to an insoluble compartment in the cytoplasm. Recent in vitro reconstitution studies revealed that MDA5 formed a filament-like complex (also RIG-I-oligomer formation) on its ligand dsRNA (Peisley et al., 2011, Peisley et al., 2013; Patel et al., 2013; Berke et al., 2012), which promoted the prion-like aggregation of MAVS (Hou et al., 2011). The artificial oligomerization of RIG-I using a chemical cross-linker in the cytoplasm activated the antiviral response in the absence of viral infection (Takamatsu et al., 2013). ATP hydrolysis induced filament disassembly, suggesting the transient formation of these filaments under physiological conditions. Mitochondrial fusion and fission are previously shown to be critical for the aggregate formation of MAVS (Onoguchi et al., 2010). In addition to mitochondria, several groups reported the importance of virus-induced stress granules (SGs) as critical loci for the activation of RLR (Onomoto et al., 2012). In several viral infections, viral dsRNA was found to activate PKR, leading to the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, which ultimately induced the formation of SGs, containing SG components, RLRs, and viral RNAs, to promote the activation of RLR (Onomoto et al., 2012; Yoo et al., 2014; Narita et al., 2014).",

In order to achieve this recruitment of IRF-3 and phosphorylation by TBK1 and IKK-i, recent studies revealed the importance of the phosphorylation of MAVS serine-rich clusters containing Ser442 (Liu et al., 2015). In certain cell types, RIG-I induces the production of IL-1\u03b2 through IPS-1/CARD9/NF-\u03baB signaling upon viral infection (Poeck et al., 2010). Unlike MDA5, RIG-I is capable of triggering inflammatory responses by the direct formation of a signal complex with ASC and caspase-1 in an NLRP3-independent manner, suggesting a distinctive role of RIG-I in inflammatory responses (Poeck et al., 2010).",

In the case of measles and Nipah viruses, V proteins have been shown to repress MDA5 by targeting the phosphatases PP1\u03b1/\u03b3, thereby preventing the dephosphorylation of MDA5 CARDs (Davis et al., 2014). The N protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) specifically binds to MDA5, leading to the relocalization of MDA5 to large inclusion bodies (Lifland et al., 2012). In addition, the NS1 and NS2 proteins of RSV were found to form a large and heterogeneous degradative complex on mitochondria, designated the NS-degradasome, which degraded RIG-I and several signaling molecules including TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7 (Goswami et al., 2013).",

NS1 was also shown to directly associate with the ubiquitin E3 ligases TRIM25 and Riplet to block the ubiquitination of RIG-I CARDs and CTD, respectively (Rajsbaum et al., 2012). The leader protease of foot-and-mouth disease virus inactivates RIG-I by deubiquitination (Clementz et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011).

Mice with the Ifih1 missense mutation (G821S) were recently found to spontaneously develop lupus-like symptoms including nephritis and a skin rash (Funabiki et al., 2014). This is the first direct evidence to demonstrate that mutations in RLR were the direct cause of an autoimmune disease. In addition to the upregulation of type I IFNs and IFN-inducible genes, inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF were induced in multiple organs in this mutant mouse, reflecting ubiquitous expression of MDA5. The missense mutation, G821S enhanced the basal level of IFN by MDA5, but abrogated responsiveness to viral infections as well as the ATPase activity induced by dsRNA. The autoimmune phenotype was not observed in the mouse background of Mavs\u2212/\u2212. These findings indicated that this mutation conferred constitutive activity on MDA5 rather than being hypersensitive to endogenous or viral RNA. Moreover, a simple increase in the dosage of the Ifih1 gene did not induce spontaneous nephritis or any autoimmune symptoms (Crampton et al., 2012), suggesting that a dysregulation in MDA5 by a mutation may be essential for triggering autoimmunity. The further characterization of the mutant MDA5 will provide an insight into the precise mechanism responsible for the development of autoimmunity.",

Different assays were adopted by the two groups; therefore, the activities of these MDA5 mutants remain controversial. Rice et al.

RIG-I E373A leads to the constitutive production of type I IFN. Moreover, a further analysis of DDX58 in 100 individuals with congenital glaucoma resulted in the identification of another mutation (C268F). Glu373 and Cys268 of RIG-I reside in the ATP-binding motifs I and II in the Hel-1 domain, respectively (Figure 4). The constitutive activities and responsiveness to ligand RNA of these mutants have not yet been characterized. Although previous studies suggested a link between aberrant RIG-I expression and autoimmune diseases in the gut, evidence for the involvement of RIG-I remains scarce. Another group reported a novel missense mutation (R822G) in IFIH1 in SMS patients (Rutsch et al., 2015). MDA5 R822G exhibits constitutive activity. The position of this mutation is next to the G821S mutation in mice. R822 and G821 are conserved in humans and mice, with mutations in these residues resulting in a constitutively active phenotype.",

(2009) reported that two canonical splice site variants in IFIH1, a nonsense variant and missense substitution, were protective against T1D. These loss-of-function mutations in IFIH1 may attenuate innate immune responses against viruses. Enteroviruses, especially coxsackievirus B4, have been strongly implicated in the triggering of T1D. Moreover, MDA5 acts as a sensor for detecting the Picornaviridae family, including coxsackievirus. Further studies on IFIH1 may provide us with a clear connection between coxsackievirus infection and the development of T1D (Jaidane and Hober, 2008). Previous studies examined GWASs, and associated IFIH1 SNPs with the risk of psoriasis, selective IgA deficiency, and dilated cardiomyopathy (Ferreira et al., 2010; Dou et al., 2014).
