            "text": "COVID-19 has affected the world tremendously. It is critical that biological experiments and clinical designs are informed by computational approaches for time-and cost-effective solutions. Comparative analyses particularly can play a key role to reveal structural changes in proteins due to mutations, which can lead to behavioural changes, such as the increased binding of the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein to human ACE2 receptors. The aim of this report is to provide an easy to follow tutorial for biologists and others without delving into different bioinformatics tools. More complex analyses such as the use of large-scale computational methods can then be utilised. Starting with a SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, the report shows visualising DNA sequence features, deriving amino acid sequences, and aligning different genomes to analyse mutations and differences. The report provides further insights into how the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein mutated for higher binding affinity to human ACE2 receptors, compared to the SARS-CoV protein, by integrating existing 3D protein models.",

Figure 4 shows the alignment of the surface glycoprotein amino acid sequences from SARS-CoV-2 (LC528232) and SARS-CoV (AP006557). Although the alignment shows high similarities between the amino acid sequences, gaps and mutations also exist. A more detailed view of the alignment of the two protein sequences can be seen in Figure   5 . Secondary structures are integrated into the view. The surface exposed regions are compared using different options such as the Kyte-Doolittle scale. Additional options can be configured from the 'Alignment Settings -Protein info' tab. Wan and co-workers reported that mutations in the surface glycoprotein's five amino acids can play a critical role in binding to the human ACE2 receptors. 5 Anderson and co-workers provide their own insights, including another 6th critical amino acid. Here, we integrated secondary structure predictions and realigned the sequences in order to show how these five mutations may affect the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 protein ( Figure 6 ). The alignment of secondary structure predictions show the additions of three beta strands and the loss of one beta strand. These changes may affect the folding of the protein and hence its binding. Predictions for secondary structures may reveal some information about the binding of the surface glycoprotein. However, 3D models may help understanding the surfaces that are exposed and are likely to bind to other molecules. In order to understand the effects of the mutated region in Figure 6 (shown using the dashed box), an existing 3D model of the SARS-",
