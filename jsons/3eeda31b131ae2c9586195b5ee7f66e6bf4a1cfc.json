For this topic, in contrast to previous studies, there seems to be a high degree of convergence between articles shared in the social web and citation counts, at least in the short term. In particular, articles that are extensively tweeted on the day first indexed are likely to be highly read and relatively highly cited three weeks later. Researchers needing wide scope literature searches (rather than health focused PubMed or medRxiv searches) should start with Google Scholar or Dimensions and can use tweet and Mendeley reader counts as indicators of likely importance.",

            "text": "The international scientific effort to mitigate COVID-19 is unprecedented in scale and rapidity. For instance, PubMed added related publications daily between 1 st January to 18 th of April 2020 1 , with a peak of over 300 in a single day. This effort is in response to the lethality and rapid spread of the disease, as well as the major economic and social consequences of COVID-19 lockdowns. As part of the response, researchers, professionals and the public will need to consult the scientific literature for the latest findings. Whilst this is normal for science, standard literature search methods may be ineffective in a rapid publishing environment. Traditional citation indexes may not be fast enough, especially given that they do not index most preprints, and citation counts may not help point to important studies. The more inclusive online citation indexes of sites like Google Scholar and Dimensions.ai seem like suitable alternatives since they index both the traditional scholarly literature and documents not published in journals, including preprints (Herzog, Hook, & Konkiel, 2020; Kousha, & Thelwall, 2019a) . Whilst there are initiatives to help various communities with curated collections of COVID-19 documents, such as published biomedical documents from PubMed Central (PMC, 2020), preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv (medRxiv, 2020) , and a data mining collection (Allen Institute, 2020), none are complete. It is therefore important to assess the COVID-19 coverage and growth of scholarly publication indexes, as well as the value of citation counts for new COVID-19 research. In parallel with scholarly needs for literature, the public, professionals and policy makers also need to access current COVID-19 research to inform their decision-making, such as whether to recommend wearing protective masks. This may be in addition to, or to clarify, World Health Organisation guidelines (WHO, 2020) . They may therefore share relevant academic research in the social web (e.g., Merchant & Lurie, 2020) , generating interest that may picked up by alternative indicators (altmetrics). Thus, altmetrics, may be useful in helping the public to identify the most relevant research or may help point researchers to topics considered important by the public. It would therefore be helpful to assess whether altmetrics can perform this role. In particular, since altmetrics can reflect both academic and non-academic interests (Mohammadi, Barahmand, & Thelwall, 2019; Mohammadi, Thelwall, Kwasny, & Holmes, 2018) , it is not clear whether they will essentially be early indicators of citation impact or whether they reflect societal or other impacts for COVID-19. Altmetrics have already been shown useful to identify the spread of a misleading COVID-19 paper that was subsequently withdrawn (Ioannidis, 2020) . This paper addresses the above issues through a primarily descriptive analysis of the evolution of four online scholarly databases, and associated altmetrics, over four weeks in March-April 2020, when many countries were experiencing a lockdown. A previous study of 20 January to 12 April 2020 has shown continually increasing growth in the COVID-19 coverage of scholarly databases, with substantial variations between fields (Torres-Salinas, 2020). Individual highly cited or shared papers are also important to examine for qualitative insights into the types of research that are attracting substantial attention. The following research questions drive this paper.",

(Song & Karako, 2020) . The importance of scientific publishing to respond to infectious disease outbreaks has been emphasised by many bibliometric studies of previous cases (Rethlefsen & Livinski, 2013) , such as SARS (Kostoff & Morse, 2011; Tian & Zheng, 2015) , H7N9 influenza (Tian & Zheng, 2015) , HIV/AIDS (Pouris & Pouris, 2011) , Ebola (Pouris & Ho, 2016) and Zika (Delwiche, 2018) . One recent study using Dimensions, Scopus, WoS and the LitCovid (Chen, Allot, & Lu, 2020) curated list has investigated the daily growth of Covid-19 related publications in citation databases and digital libraries during 1 st January to 7 th of April, finding that Dimensions had best coverage (9,435 publications) compared to WoS (718) and Scopus (1,568). The weekly growth of PubMed was about 1,000 publications and the PubMed Central (1,398), medRxiv (989) and SSRN (608) repositories had best coverage of open access COVID-19 publications (Torres-Salinas, 2020). Google Scholar was not assessed and all evidence was extracted from Dimensions, so the counts for other repositories may not be complete.",

People typically register documents in Mendeley when they have read them or intend to read them (Mohammadi, Thelwall, & Kousha, 2016) , so it is reasonable to regard Mendeley counts as an indicator of readership. According to self-reports in the site, users are predominantly academics and postgraduate students, with a few undergraduates, librarians and people in non-academic occupations (Mohammadi, Thelwall, Haustein, & Larivi\u00e8re, 2015) .

Whilst the two types of data seem to be close to interchangeable for sets of mature articles (although they can differ sharply for individual education-oriented papers: Thelwall, 2017c), the advantage of Mendeley reader counts is that they appear and are useful a year before citation counts (Thelwall, 2017b) . They may even be common enough to be used for scientometric purposes by the publication month of the publishing journal. Moreover, since early Mendeley reader counts correlate positively with later citation counts (Thelwall, 2018a) , Mendeley reader counts are early academic impact indicators.

More articles have non-zero tweet counts than non-zero scores on any other altmetric, other than Mendeley (Thelwall, Haustein, Larivi\u00e8re, & Sugimoto, 2013) . As a news-oriented social media platform, articles can expect to get a substantial proportion of their tweets in the week of publication, so Twitter is visible long before citations. Nevertheless, tweeter counts (counting the number of tweeters rather than the number of tweets) are problematic to interpret. Whilst about half of people that tweet academic research are not academics (Mohammadi, Thelwall, Kwasny, & Holmes, 2018) , tweets typically contain just article titles or brief summaries (Thelwall, Tsou, Weingart, Holmberg, & Haustein, 2013) , serving as publicity rather than evidence of impact. Together with often close to zero correlations with citation counts (Costas, Zahedi, & Wouters, 2015; Haustein, Larivi\u00e8re, Thelwall, Amyot, & Peters, 2014; Thelwall, Haustein, Larivi\u00e8re, & Sugimoto, 2013) , there is insufficient evidence to claim that tweeter counts are indicators of either academic or societal impact. Nevertheless, they may have some value for healthrelated research, where there is more public interest in academic research (Haustein, Larivi\u00e8re, Thelwall, Amyot, & Peters, 2014; Mohammadi, Gregory, Thelwall, Barahmand, 2020) .",

Since Google Scholar does not have an API and the number of matches exceeds its 1000 limit per query, it was not possible to extract Google Scholar's set of matching documents. In contrast, Dimensions.ai has an API allowing complete sets of matching document records to be downloaded and so it was chosen as the base source of COVID-19 documents. It was checked daily with the following set of queries in the Dimensions API (Applications Programming Interface), designed to match publications about COVID-19 using various related names. These queries are all designed to be precise but there were still a few false matches. The datasets analysed include substantial numbers of papers from preprint planforms, including medRxiv, SSRN, arXiv, bioRxiv, ChemRxiv and Research Square (Table 3 , as in: Torres-Salinas, 2020) as well as books and more traditional journals (Table 3) . Although most documents were classified as Articles by Dimensions, this type includes medRxiv preprints and diverse types of document published in journals, such as notes, short communications, editorials and commentaries (Table 4 ). Since many editorials seemed to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the journal or field, this added less citable documents to the Article class. The surprising number of books and book chapters (13% overall) seems to be primarily due to pre-COVID-19 discussions about Coronaviruses, matching the query \"Coronavirus 2\". The low number of conference proceedings may be due to conference cancellations, or the inability of most conferences to respond to the COVID-19 timescale.",

Only 106 of these seemed to be standard journal articles. The rest were mainly editorials, letters (called letters, letters to the editor, or correspondence; one Letter was classed as an article) or news stories. In some cases, documents were called \"article\" by the publishing journal but were clearly news stories published in a news-focused magazine/journal. The reduced set of 106 journal articles from March 24, 2020 was used for follow-up correlation tests. (Zahedi, Haustein, & Bowman, 2014) . Webometric Analyst was also used to identify counts of citations in Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and online news outlets to these documents, as identified by DOI queries to Altmetric.com. This data provider seems to have the most comprehensive coverage of Twitter, the largest of the sources (Ortega, 2018) . Twitter and Facebook are logical choices to investigate because they seem to be the social media sources that most cite academic research (Costas, Zahedi, & Wouters, 2015; Thelwall, Haustein, Larivi\u00e8re, & Sugimoto, 2013) . Reddit and news may give a news perspective, although Reddit is a multipurpose site (Ovadia, 2015; Stoddard, 2015) and the news sources harvested by Altmetric.com presumably exclude some major paywalled press sources. There were some gaps in the data collection due to documents not being returned by a query on one day when they had been returned on a previous day. This produced missing citation and altmetric scores, affecting the analysis. To avoid this issue, these missing values were replaced by approximate values by linear interpolation (when scores were available for previous and subsequent dates), linear extrapolation (when at least two previous but no subsequent scores were available), or constant values (when only one previous value was available).",

Since altmetrics other than Mendeley tend to have very weak correlations with citation counts (Costas, Zahedi, & Wouters, 2015; Haustein, Larivi\u00e8re, Thelwall, Amyot, & Peters, 2014; Thelwall, Haustein, Larivi\u00e8re, & Sugimoto, 2013) , high correlations are not expected. Field normalization was not used for either analysis because (a) the papers cover a relatively narrow topic (COVID-19) even though they span many subject areas and (b) it is impractical to field normalize the values because this would require daily updates of the whole of Dimensions, Altmetric.com and Mendeley for the calculations.",

Shorter publication formats and analyses are more evident in the social web and news sources, representing a partially different type of document. The social web and news articles also seemed to give information that might be particularly useful as public health information for the vast majority of the planet's population that had not yet caught COVID-19 by 18 April 2020. These include studies on facemasks, the stability of the virus on surfaces, and pregnancy risks. None of the five documents most cited on Reddit were also in the top five for the other sources, although they seem to cover similar topics (Table 7) . The paper about Malayan pangolins is the exception for not covering the primary characteristics of the disease or public health issues. This may be an artefact of the relatively low numbers of Reddit citations. Although the top five articles for Dimensions were published in 2020, by 21 March they had all been cited at least 200 times in Dimensions (Figure 3) , perhaps mainly by preprints, letters and short form fast publishing formats, such as brief communications, (academic) news, and case reports. All five documents exhibit a reasonably steady rate of increase. The simultaneous jumps in the lines presumably reflect weekly large scale database refreshing for Dimensions, although there were also smaller daily changes. The top five Mendeley documents also started 21 March with a high number of readers, but almost five times more than the number of Dimensions citations (Figure 4 ). There was a similar pattern of steadily increasing numbers of Mendeley readers with periodic interruptions. In this case the interruptions resulted in temporary decreases in the numbers of Mendeley readers. This could be due to two factors. Either the database consolidates weekly, such as by merging duplicates, or its search is somehow weakened periodically so that the free text search (which is submitted in parallel with the DOI search) matches less documents. It is not possible to check which is correct from the data since Mendeley reports reader counts but not the identities of these readers. Twitter shows a very different pattern to Dimensions and Mendeley. First, some of the documents are much younger, published during the date range analysed. Second, the number of tweeters achieves close to its maximum when first found by Dimensions, although this is not necessarily the original publication date. Facebook has a similar growth pattern to Twitter, except that there is a period of increasing interest for the proximal origin paper (Figure 6 ), which has a more moderate growth on Twitter. The (apparently speculative) news story about CERN scientists that was popular on Facebook did not get traction on Twitter and seems unlikely to be much cited or read. The top news-cited articles were all covered by at least 400 news sources by the end of the period (Figure 7) . Perhaps surprisingly, given that news is very time-dependant, all the sources experienced significant increases in the number of citing sources. Either Altmetric.com is constantly expanding its coverage of news sources (which is possible, but seems unlikely) or news stories about COVID-19 are prepared to cite old articles, perhaps for a more in-depth commentary or as background context for new articles. There were relatively few citations from Reddit, despite its use as a news source and many academic themes (subreddits) within the site (Figure 8 ). Perhaps reflecting its news status, older articles do not seem to increase their Reddit citation counts. ",

Mendeley overtook Twitter after a week. The average citation counts for the remaining three sources were all much lower than for Mendeley and Twitter ( Figure 10 ).

By April 18, 2020, correlations between Dimensions citations and altmetrics for documents first found by Dimensions in March 24 were strong, except for Reddit (Table 7) . Since most (229; 66%) documents were uncited by 18 April, the correlation mainly confirms that, except for Reddit, news stories, publishing authors, and users of the different platforms tended to select the same documents for attention. The altmetrics also correlated moderately or strongly with each other, except for Reddit, in agreement with this conclusion. Thus, for the narrow topic of COVID-19, there seems to be a researcher-news-social media consensus about the most important topics, at least in the (very) short term. The correlations (Table 8) do not take into account field differences or document type differences. The relatively high correlations could be at least partially due to ignoring contributions of low relevance to COVID-19, such as book chapters mentioning the possibility of a coronavirus 2, editorials, letters, and subject areas making relatively peripheral contributions to immediate needs. The influence of non-article document types on the correlations were tested by filtering out all non-articles. After manually removing documents that were not journal articles (mainly editorials, news, and letters), there were 106 standard journal articles (including reviews). Nevertheless, the correlations did not substantially change (Table 9 ). Some of the editorials were cited, explaining the lack of change. The positive correlations seemed to be due to articles with a stronger focus on COVID-19 being more noticed, whereas articles with a weaker focus on COVID-19 or giving weaker evidence were less noticed. Thus, both altmetrics and citations seem to focus on contributions that are more core to COVID-19 as a medical and public health issue. The two most common Dimensions subject codes for the March 24 set were 1117 Public Health and Health Services (n=78) and 1103 Clinical Sciences (n=32). Except for Reddit (correlations close to 0), the pairwise correlations change little if the set is restricted to only subject categories 1117 or only 1103, with or without excluding non-article types. For example, the lowest correlation between Twitter and Dimensions for any of these four restricted sets is 0.638 (category 1103 with all document types, n=32). Thus, except for Reddit, the strong positive correlations between indicators do not seem to be due to field differences in the dataset. Table 9 . Spearman correlations between citation counts and altmetrics from 18 April 2020 for COVID-19 journal articles first found by Dimensions on 24 March 2020. (n=106).",

            "text": "Ideally, an indicator would help researchers and policy makers to identify important articles when they are first published, without having to wait for enough citations. To check for early evidence of later citation impact, the indicators were correlated with Dimensions citation counts on April 18, representing longer term citation counts (this is a weak proxy since decades are sometimes used for long term citations in other contexts, e.g., Stegehuis, Litvak, & Waltman, 2015) . On the day that a document is first findable in Dimensions, its tweeter count is the best indicator of likely long-term citation impact (Figure 11 ). Twitter users seem to be able to notice documents approximately on the date of first publication for their potential importance to COVID-19. After this date, the tweeter count does not increase much and its correlation with longer term Dimensions citations is stable. After about three weeks, Mendeley reader counts take over as a marginally better indicator of longer-term citation impact. It is not clear whether the same would be true for more mature citation counts, however, such as after a year. It is possible that early Dimensions citations (and Mendeley readers) reflect more temporary interest and are themselves highly influenced by the news or social sharing on Twitter, for example. The most cited sets of five papers analysed above suggest that highly recognised papers are particularly important for the disease, however. As above, this correlation ignores field differences and document type differences, although document differences seem to have little effect (Tables 8, 9 ). Figure 11 . Spearman correlations between altmetrics and Dimensions citation counts from 18 April for COVID-19 documents first found by Dimensions on 24 March 2020 (n=349). Correlations with Dimensions citation counts on the same dates are also reported for context.",

For example, Dimensions citation counts accrue more rapidly than previously reported for any topic. For comparison, the Scopus citations of 12 subject categories (full journal articles only) were a maximum of 0.12 in the month of publication, whereas the COVID-19 mixed set averaged almost double this after three weeks. The results are also qualitatively different in some respects. Whilst correlation tests have previously found tweeter counts to have little value as a scholarly impact indicator due to very low correlation with citation counts (Costas, Zahedi, & Wouters, 2015; Haustein, Larivi\u00e8re, Thelwall, Amyot, & Peters, 2014; Thelwall, Haustein, Larivi\u00e8re, & Sugimoto, 2013) , the current study has found Tweet counts to be reasonable academic impact indicators and the best early impact indicator for the first three weeks. This may be partly due to the set of articles here covering multiple disciplines, but the results for the top-cited documents suggest that altmetrics are effective at pointing to the documents that are most central to COVID-19 as a medical and public health issue. Thus, the unprecedented threat of COVID-19 seems to have led to an unprecedentedly high and focused level of societal and academic attention being given to the most relevant research.",

This should not be a problem for medical researchers trained to use MeSH queries effectively, but might be problematic for other researchers, end users and the public, who may find bewilderingly many matches for their queries. The altmetric results suggest that altmetrics may be helpful for researchers needed to quickly identify the most useful new documents from the large number published daily. Altmetric counts may help to distinguish between core primary research and other contributions, such as editorial commentaries with narrower disciplinary or professional relevance (e.g., radiographers). Perhaps ironically, given that a core original goal for altmetrics was to develop indicators of societal impact that were different from scholarly impact indicators (Priem, Taraborelli, Groth, & Neylon, 2010) , their greatest value (as early impact indicators) seems be occurring when the two concepts are most closely converging.",
