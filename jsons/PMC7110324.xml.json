            "text": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) is the primary cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, with 30 000\u201350 000 cases reported annually, mainly in children (Diagana et al., 2007). Acute encephalitis develops in about 1\u201320 cases per 1000 infections, leading to death in 25% of cases and producing serious neurological lesions in 30% (Diagana et al., 2007; Jackson et al., 2007). Infections with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are most often asymptomatic. Only one in 300 cases produce clinical features (Solomon, 1997). The first signs of infection appear after an incubation period of between 6 and 14 days (Diagana et al., 2007). The disease usually begins with a high fever, chills, muscle pain and meningitis-type headaches accompanied by vomiting. The initial clinical features in children usually involve gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal pains). These nonspecific symptoms can continue for 2\u20134 days. After this period, the patient's condition deteriorates rapidly. Eighty-five percent of subjects suffer from convulsions (Kumar et al., 1990). The meningeal syndrome predominates, causing painful neck stiffness. Additionally, motor paralyses including hemiplegia and tetraplegia may also occur. In about 30% of patients, tremor, rigidity, abnormal movements and other signs of extrapyramidal involvement are present (Kumar et al., 1994). Recovery usually leaves serious behavioral and neurological sequelae such as persistently altered sensorium, extrapyramidal syndrome, epileptic seizures and severe mental retardation in children (Diagana et al., 2007).",

JEV helicase, composed of three domains, displays an asymmetric distribution of charges on its surface, and contains a tunnel large enough to accommodate single-stranded RNA. Each of the motifs I (Walker A motif), II (Walker B motif) and VI contribute to the NTP-binding pocket. From mutation analysis (Yamashita et al., 2008), it was possible to conclude that all of the residues in the Walker A motif (Gly199, Lys200 and Thr201), in addition to the polar residues within the NTP-binding pocket (Gln457, Arg461 and Arg464), and also Arg458 in the outside of the pocket in the motif IV, were significant for NTPase and helicase activities and virus replication. In particular, Lys200 was crucial and could not be exchanged for other amino acid residues without sacrificing activity.",

The obtained pharmacophore model was tested in the screening (with the application of Screen Library module of discovery studio 2.1) of a database of 10 000 ZINC drug-like compounds, which additionally contained known inhibitors 1\u20132, noncompetitive inhibitors 3\u20134 and compounds 5\u20137 with the confirmed lack of activity toward JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase. Next, the Screen Library module of discovery studio 2.1 was applied to screen the ZINC database of about 1 161 000 lead-like compounds. Fifteen hits (8\u201322) have been selected and docked with Surflex to the JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase-binding site. The final ranking list was established by the simple consensus scoring procedure. The sum of the total value obtained in the docking with Surflex and the fit value obtained in the Screen Library procedure with discovery studio 2.1 multiplied by 2 (to obtain equally significant contributions) was used as the final score. For the identified hits, ability to cross blood\u2013brain barrier and lipophilicity (with the Suzuki\u2013Kudo atomic contribution method) were calculated using Preadmet server (preadmet.bmdrc.org).",

The value of the dihedral angle determined by C5\u2032 atom of ribose, the neighboring oxygen atom, \u03b1 phosphorus atom and the bridging oxygen atom varied from \u2212162.25\u00b0 to 53.63\u00b0 for the most bent conformers.

It was observed that the lowest energy conformers were characterized by the least linear conformation of ATP. The energy difference between the geometrically extreme structures was 54.25 kcal mol\u22121, due to the presence of hydrogen bonds stabilizing the ATP molecule. During the molecular dynamics simulation of ATP\u2013enzyme complexes the ATP conformation became more bent. However, the lowest energy conformers did not result in the binding pose, which would be in accordance with the mutagenesis data (Yamashita et al., 2008), and therefore the compromise conformer was accepted as the final one.",

The other keto group of the inhibitor is engaged in the network of hydrogen bond with Arg464 and, through the water molecules, with the main chain NH hydrogen atoms of Gly197 and Ser198. Arg464 also interacts with the imidazole ring nitrogen atom through another water molecule. The imidazole moiety interacts through the next water molecule with Glu286.

The first class may be treated as close analogs of nucleosides and nucleotides. As these inhibitors are similar to the natural NS3 helicase/NTPase ligand, ATP, they are very likely to compete with ATP for the same binding site. Benzimidazoles and benzotriazoles as well as some naturally occurring compounds such as antibiotic nogalamycin 4 are modulators that interact with the allosteric binding site (Borowski et al., 2002, 2003). The mechanism of their modulating effect remains unclear. However, it may be speculated that the second binding site, which could be occupied by a nucleotide, nucleoside and even by nucleotide base, probably fulfils a regulatory function with respect to the NTPase and/or helicase activities of the enzyme (Borowski et al., 2002).",

The approximate configuration of ATP in the binding site can be seen by comparing a JEV helicase structure with one of a similar helicases crystallized in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog. For example, in the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli RecQ helicase catalytic core in the complex with the ATP analog ATP\u03b3S (PDB code 1OYY) the adenine moiety is packed between Tyr23 and Arg27 side chains and hydrogen bonds are formed between the N6 and N7 atoms of the adenine and Gln30 of RecQ motif 0 (Bernstein et al., 2003). The ATP\u03b3S triphosphate is bound to RecQDC by Lys53 and several backbone amides in motif I, and through an Mn2+ ion, which makes water-mediated contact with Ser54 of motif I and Asp146 of motif II. The obtained binding mode of ATP to JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase corresponds to the position of ATP\u03b3S RecQ helicase catalytic core described above. Moreover, it should be stressed that the conformation of ATP\u03b3S is slightly bent, similar to the final conformation of ATP. The conformation and binding mode of ATP in the binding pocket of JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase are also consistent with the recently obtained crystal structure of dengue virus 4 NS3 helicase in complex of ADP, PDB file 2JLS (Luo et al., 2008). In this crystal structure, the role of conserved lysine (Lys199) and two conserved arginines (Arg460 and Arg463) are clearly visible.",

In particular, the role of Glu286 and Arg464 was clearly depicted. Moreover, docking of 1\u20132 allowed the identification of Arg202 as an additional important residue of the binding pocket, making this arginine a straightforward candidate for mutational studies. The analysis of ATP\u2013enzyme complex allowed speculation about the role of conserved threonine Thr201. Most probably, it directs the ligand properly toward interactions with Lys200 and the conserved arginine residues. A similar role may be assigned to the branched side chains of apolar amino acids (especially Val227 and Ile411), which was demonstrated in the case of 2 and was suggested earlier for ionotropic glutamate receptors (Kaczor et al., 2008). Docking of 1\u20132 indicated Asn417 as an additional anchoring point, whereas docking of identified hits 8\u201322 also indicated Glu231 as a potentially important residue for interactions with inhibitors.",

Only one of them, namely the one containing pentose moiety 14, may be treated as a far analog of nucleosides. This structural diversity may prove beneficial because it increases the likelihood that the new inhibitors will be selective toward human ATPases. This is a significant problem: it is worth emphasizing that ring-expanded nucleosides 1 and 2 also have high affinity to human Suv3 mitochondrial helicase (routinely used to test the selectivity of novel inhibitors of viral helicase/NTPase), which excludes them as drug candidates (Zhang et al., 2003).",

This seems promising, as the research on specific anti-JEV compounds may lead to the development of a drug with broad antiviral spectrum of activity. Indeed, structural analysis of the helicases of dengue virus (DEN), yellow fever virus (YFV) and HCV revealed that these viral helicases have very similar structures composed of three functional domains (Yao et al., 1997; Wu et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2005; Yamashita et al., 2008). The amino acid sequences of the NS3 helicase domain of JEV exhibited 65%, 44% and 23% homology to those of DEN, YFV and HCV, respectively (Yamashita et al., 2008). The crystal structures of the NS3 helicases of DEN (Xu et al., 2005) and YFV (Wu et al., 2005) are similar to that of JEV, but slightly different from HCV (Yao et al., 1997). Yamashita (2008) emphasized that the distance between domains 1 and 2 of HCV helicase is longer than that in most flavivirus NS3 helicases. This leads to the conclusion that the HCV helicase has a larger ATP-binding pocket than other flaviviruses, and that the folding of domain 3 of the HCV helicase is unique, whereas the folding of JEV is very similar to those of other flaviviruses, including DEN and YFV (Yamashita et al., 2008). Superposition of JEV, DEN, YFV and HCV helicases further clarified that the HCV helicase has a unique conformation in the NTPase-binding region and domain 3 in comparison with JEV, DEN and YFV helicases (Yamashita et al., 2008). In particular, the conformation of motifs I and II of HCV helicase was different from that of JEV, DEN and YFV helicases. The distance between motifs I and II of C\u03b1 of HCV and the other flaviviruses was 6.7 and 3.5 \u00c5, respectively (Yamashita et al., 2008). There was also a 4.7 \u00c5 difference in the distance of Nz of Lys200 in the motif I between JEV and HCV, suggesting that HCV helicase has a wider ATP-binding pocket than other flaviviruses (Yamashita et al., 2008). In contrast to the structure of motifs I and II, that of motif VI was well conserved among the flavivirus helicases, including HCV. Although a subtle difference is observed, the ATP-binding residues in JEV, DEN, YFV, and HCV helicases are well conserved, suggesting that flavivirus helicases possess similar mechanisms of ATP hydrolysis, which reflects the lack of specificity of compounds 1 and 2.",
