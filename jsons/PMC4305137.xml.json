Younger age is an independent predictor of infection with HAdV and common respiratory bacteria, and age increases the odds of viral\u2013bacterial coinfection.

Most primary HAdV-C infections occur within the first 2 years of life [29]. The highest levels of HAdV DNA are detected in adenotonsillar tissue of 2-year-old children undergoing routine adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy, and the amount of HAdV DNA decreases with increasing age [30]. HAdVs demonstrate the ability to establish latent infection within lymphocytes [30], tonsillar tissue [31], and the lung [32] and are capable of evading host innate immune responses via multiple mechanisms [33].",

Furthermore, we have recently shown that HAdV is significantly more likely to be detected in BAL fluid of children with PBB (23%) compared with controls (4%) [14]. It is possible that chronic inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract predispose to HAdV persistence in the respiratory tract, or that HAdVs induce an inflammatory response that may be a key factor in chronic respiratory disease pathogenesis.

They found that inflammation was greatest in the presence of both HAdV and NTHi, compared with HAdV or NTHi alone. Furthermore, timing of inoculation was important. HAdV inoculation prior to NTHi inoculation resulted in the greatest tympanic membrane inflammation and mucosal dysfunction [43]. We have previously shown that neutrophilic lower airway inflammation is maximal in the presence of viral\u2013bacterial coinfection of the airways of children [12].

First, although our cross-sectional data highlights important associations, we cannot attribute causality. Repeated lower airway sampling would be needed to establish the temporal sequence of lower airway infection and determine a cause-and-effect relationship. However, subjecting children to repeated general anesthesia for lower airway sampling, solely for research, would be unethical. Second, we did not include HAdV serology in our blood test panel. This ideally requires repeat venipuncture, which was not feasible in our context as many children in the study reside outside the Brisbane area. With regards to methods of HAdV detection, although culture detects infectious virus, PCR is more sensitive and is the current clinical standard [16]. Although a positive PCR for HAdV does not readily distinguish infectious from noninfectious virus, the identification of HAdV DNA indicates that infection has occurred at some stage. Further, HAdV's association with a systemic immune response (ie, elevated NK cells) supports the notion that HAdV may play a clinically relevant role. Third, we detected few conventional respiratory panel viruses (other than HAdV) and only performed extended viral panel analyses on a subset, limiting our ability to explore other possible viral\u2013bacterial and viral\u2013viral interactions. Last, the strong relationship between age and HAdV status, and the increased odds of bacterial coinfection with HAdV in younger children, is likely to be significant. This finding raises the question of whether younger children are predisposed to polymicrobial infection, via immature immune system processes, rather than a true viral\u2013bacterial interaction. Timing of HAdV acquisition, with respect to age, may therefore be important in further evaluating the link between HAdV and future development of PBB and/or BE.",

The significant association between HAdV and lower airway bacterial infection suggests a possible role of HAdV-C in the pathogenesis of chronic suppurative lung diseases in young children. Our findings may have implications for targets in the prevention of chronic suppurative lung diseases; however, further research to definitely establish causality would be required.",

The evolutionary distances were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method [23] and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. Additional sequences for speciation are included from GenBank (labeled with genotype and accession number in bold).
