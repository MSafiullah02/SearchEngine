            "text": "\nCryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that can cause gastrointestinal disease in a wide variety of mammals, including humans, cattle, sheep, goat and pigs (Olson et al., 2004). Bovine cryptosporidiosis occurs worldwide with prevalences of 20\u201380% in young calves in different European countries (Appelbee et al., 2005). Studies performed in the United States showed that particularly calves at 2 weeks of age were excreting C. parvum oocysts (Santin et al., 2008) with prevalences of 45.8% in calves of 1\u20138 weeks of age. Prevalences in milking cows were significantly lower and mainly not concerning C. parvum, representing the only zoonotic species and also the most pathogenic species for cattle (Fayer et al., 2007). Although C. parvum infection is often detected in combination with other enteropathogens such as Rotavirus, Coronavirus, Escherichia coli K99 or Salmonella species, many experimental studies and investigations in the field have shown that Cryptosporidium may act as a primary pathogen (Tzipori et al., 1983, Naciri et al., 1999). More than 200 substances have been tested against cryptosporidiosis (O\u2019Donoghue, 1995, Stockdale et al., 2008) and some such as halofuginone and decoquinate are reported to exhibit promising effects (Lefay et al., 2001, Lallemand et al., 2006). Prophylactic administration of paromomycin inhibited oocyst shedding and reduced the number of days with diarrhoea in experimentally infected calves (Fayer and Ellis, 1993), but in a field trial oocyst shedding and diarrhoea started with withdrawal of the drug and no reduction of the disease was obtained (Grinberg et al., 2002). Reports on the outcomes of halofuginone treatment are controversial: in some studies, calves showed significantly reduced oocyst excretion and decreased diarrhoea (Joachim et al., 2003) preventing mortality (Naciri et al., 1993). In another study treatments with halofuginone or decoquinate had no effect on the levels of diarrhoea or dehydration, but halofuginone significantly reduced the excretion of oocysts and decoquinate increased the average daily weight gain of calves (Lallemand et al., 2006). In a further study the administration of halofuginone during the first 7 days of life inhibited oocyst excretion until 2 weeks of age, but the incidence of diarrhoea was only delayed for 3.1 days and there was no significant difference compared to the control group concerning weight gain (Jarvie et al., 2005). Halofuginone is the only drug currently available for the treatment of bovine cryptosporidiosis, but it is known to be relatively toxic and care must be taken not to exceed the therapeutic dose. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is an antimicrobial substance that has been applied for antiparasitic treatments in dogs, cats, sheep and goats (Euzeby et al., 1980, Gookin et al., 2001, Viel et al., 2007). NTZ has been FDA-approved for human use for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in children and adults, and also for the treatment of equine protozoan myeloencephalitis caused by Sarcocystis neurona. The goal of the present pilot study was to investigate the efficacy of NTZ for the prophylaxis and treatment of cryptosporidiosis in calves.",

The study was carried out during May\u2013December 2005 in experimental barns which are part of the veterinary hospital of the University of Zurich, Switzerland. Calves were purchased from surrounding farms 1\u20133 days after birth and all calves had received colostrum. They were housed in pens (8.5\u201310.5 m2) in groups of up to 5 animals with a litter of straw over a concrete base. The pens were cleaned daily with hot vapour pressure. Calves were fed with a commercial milk replacer supplied by an automatic milk deliverer; animals with reduced appetite were additionally hand-fed with milk and/or electrolyte solution. Water was supplied ad libitum and from the third week hay was also available. Calves were neither vaccinated, nor did they receive any supplementary vitamins during the experiment. All animals were checked twice daily clinically including faecal consistency and appetite. Weight was recorded daily. At the first manifestation of diarrhoea, faeces from all calves were tested once for antigens of bovine Coronavirus (FASTest\u00ae BCV), Rotavirus (FASTest\u00ae Rota), E. coli main pilar K99 (FASTest\u00ae\nE. coli-K99) and against C. parvum (FASTest\u00ae Crypto), all from MegaCor, Austria.",

If oocysts were present, samples were analysed by a modified method of Grinberg et al. (2002) to determine the number of cryptosporidial oocyst per gram (OPG) of faeces. Briefly, 1 g of the mixed faecal sample was mixed with 10 mL of tap water, passed through a 100-mesh sieve, the suspension centrifuged and the sediment resuspended in 4 mL of normal saline. Afterwards, 10 \u03bcl of this suspension was poured as a drop on a slide, air-dried and stained with Ziehl\u2013Neelsen. The entire area of smear was examined with a 400\u00d7 objective lens and oocysts counted. The OPG was then calculated by multiplying the result by 500 (or 5000, if there were too many oocysts to be counted and the sample had previously been diluted 10-fold). Results were not corrected for dilution in diarrhoeic stools. The mean OPG for each calf was the arithmetic mean of daily OPG from day \u22121 to 28 dpi. The number of oocysts shed was the sum of the daily OPG of each calf. To determine the effective total number of oocysts shed would have required the collection of all faeces on all days, this was not possible.",

In previous experiments other animals such as mice, rats, pigs and cats had been treated with higher dosages of NTZ, such as 100\u2013150 mg/kg BW for 5 days (Blagburn et al., 1998), 50\u2013200 mg/kg BW for 7 days (Li et al., 2003), 125\u2013250 mg/kg for 11 days (Theodos et al., 1998) and 25\u201375 mg/kg BW for 5\u201328 days (Gookin et al., 2001). Euzeby et al. (1980) described the use of NTZ in adult dogs, cats and sheep with dosages from 75 to 400 mg/kg BW and observed that general tolerance was excellent. However, in all 3 species a softened faecal consistency with almost sub-diarrhoeic patterns appeared 6\u20138 h after administration of NTZ. This mild diarrhoea lasted for approximately 24\u201336 h. No enteric lesions have been observed during postmortem analysis, with the exception of a mild catarrhal inflammation in sheep. The oral administration of NTZ with a dosage of 15 mg/kg BW bid to the calves in this study was twice the usual dosage for human patients with protozoan infections (7.5 mg/kg BW every 12 h for 3 consecutive days as recommended by Romero Cabello et al., 1997), but seemed to be an appropriate dosage for this preliminary study. In clinical studies with paediatric patients (Alinia\u00ae, Nitazoxanide 003576, www.mosbysdrugconsult.com/DrugConsult/003576.html), the most frequent adverse events reported, regardless of causality assessment, were abdominal pain (7.8%) and diarrhoea (2.1%), followed by vomiting (1.1%) and headache (1.1%).

However, the experiment was terminated with groups of 3 animals since these preliminary results did not show the expected positive effect on the course of the Cryptosporidium-infection. On the contrary, the data from the uninfected but treated group suggested that NTZ had a direct negative effect on mucous membranes of gastrointestinal tracts of calves, a problem which was also seen in piglets (Theodos et al., 1998) and cats (Gookin et al., 2001). Our results were supported by Viel et al. (2007), reporting about the use of NTZ (Navigator\u00ae, equine paste, 32%, IDEXX Laboratories) in 2\u20134-day-old kids experimentally infected with C. parvum. An acute toxicity and similar results concerning oocyst excretion and clinical outcome were observed in an experiment with totally 47 animals. The drug was described to be also active against microaerophilic and anaerobic bacteria of the gastrointestinal flora (Euzeby et al., 1980). This could therefore cause significant problems in the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants, which in turn could be more serious than the disease itself (Fox and Saravolatz, 2005, Hemphill et al., 2006). It has been speculated that gastrointestinal problems could be due to the action of the enzyme pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) or other nitro-reductases which have been hypothesized to reduce the thiazole ring-associated nitro group, and thus kill the intestinal bacterial flora through the production of free radicals (Sisson et al., 2002, Hoffman et al., 2007; reviewed in Hemphill et al., 2006). A concomitant C. parvum-infection or other infectious agents damaging the superficial intestinal epithelium may enhance the potential toxicity of treatments substances due to augmented resorption. As a consequence the severity of diarrhoea may increase, augmenting also dehydration and mortality of the animals, particularly of this delicate age group.",
