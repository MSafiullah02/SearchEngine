This genus comprised three species, including Porcine Sapelovirus (PSV) (Fauquet et al., 2005), Simian Sapelovirus and Avian Sapelovirus. Porcine Sapelovirus 1 formally named Porcine Enterovirus 8 (PEV-8) and classified as a Porcine Enterovirus A (PEV A), Porcine Sapelovirus strain csh and Porcine Sapelovirus strain YC2011 are the three well acknowledged strains of PSV (Chen et al., 2012, Krumbholz et al., 2002, Lan et al., 2011). The genome of PSV is a single-stranded positive sense RNA with length of 7.5\u20138.3 kb nucleotides (Jauka, 2010). It contains a single open reading frame flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) at both ends, and a long 5\u2032UTR (600\u20131200 nts) (Tuthill et al., 2010). Similar to Porcine Enterovirus (PEV) and Porcine Teschovirus (PTV), PSV is the causative pathogen of neurological disorders, reproductive failure, pneumonia and diarrhea in porcine (Trefny, 1930). PSV is also found frequently to co-infection with other viral pathogen in pigs with diarrhea (Lan et al., 2011).",

Several molecular methods for detecting PSV have been developed, such as reverse transcription PCR (Palmquist et al., 2002), nest reverse transcription PCR (Zell et al., 2000), and real-time quantitative PCR (Krumbholz et al., 2003). However, these methods require expensive and sophisticated instruments, which restrict their wide use. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel nucleic acid amplification method which employs Bst DNA polymerase and four specially designed primers recognizing a total of six distinct sequences on the target DNA, and amplifies DNA under isothermal conditions within 1 h (Notomi et al., 2000). In amplification process, a large amount of pyrophosphate ions are produced and react with magnesium ions resulting in formation of magnesium pyrophosphate, a white precipitate that allows easy and rapid assessment of results (Mori et al., 2001). The present study aimed to develop the RT-LAMP assay for detection of Chinese Porcine Sapelovirus strain.",

Detecting PSV in different animal origin clinical specimens could be achieved within 2 h including treatment of the samples. The sensitivity of the RT-LAMP was 10 copies/\u03bcL, and 100 times higher than RT-PCR. RT-LAMP detecting PSV infection is high specific with no cross-reaction with other viral pathogens. RT-LAMP also showed higher sensitivity by identification of two more positive samples than traditional RT-PCR (7 positive by RT-LAMP and 5 positive by RT-PCR). None of the RT-PCR detecting positive samples was missed by RT-LAMP, further showing the higher sensitivity of the RT-LAMP.",
