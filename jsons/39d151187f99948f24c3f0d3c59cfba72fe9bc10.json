It is present in all eukaryotes and is highly conserved, with only three amino acid differences between the yeast and human proteins. Ubiquitination involves covalent addition of Ub monomers to lysine residues of target proteins or of Ub itself (to form poly-Ub chains), via the involvement of at least three enzymes: a Ub-activating enzyme (E1), a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a Ub ligase (E3) (Figure 1 ). E1 enzymes are responsible for the ATP-dependent activation of the C terminus of Ub, which is then directed to the active site of an E2 enzyme. E3 ligases (of which there are over 1000 encoded by human genome) are a large and diverse group of proteins that have been subclassified by the presence of different motifs, including HECT, RING, and U box domains. HECT E3s transfer Ub from the E2 to a thioester linkage on the E3, and then to the substrate, while RING and U box E3s enable protein ubiquitination by acting as adaptors that bind to E2 proteins and substrates separately and facilitate direct transfer of Ub from the E2 protein to the substrate. A fourth group of E3 ligases, called the modulator of immune recognition (MIR) family, comprises membrane-bound proteins containing a specialized form of the RING finger, plant homeodomain (PHD) (Coscoy and Ganem, 2003; Ohmura-Hoshino et al., 2006) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 52, "end": 76, "text": "(Goldstein et al., 1975)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1365, "text": "(Coscoy and Ganem, 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1394, "text": "Ohmura-Hoshino et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 477, "end": 486, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Several RING E3s appear to act independently, but others are components of larger multiprotein complexes.

Major progress has been made in understanding pathways of ubiquitination, but our understanding of the functions of DUBs is much less advanced. DUBs are present in all eukaryotic cells, and approximately 100 are predicted to be encoded by the human genome. They include both metalloproteases (JAMM/MPN+) and cysteine proteases, with the majority being of the latter type. The cysteine protease DUBs have been grouped into four different classes based on their sequence and predicted activity: Ub-specific proteases (USPs, also referred to as Ub processing proteases, UBPs), Ub C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), ovarian tumorrelated proteases/Cezanne (OTUs), and Josephin domain proteases (JD) (Amerik and Hochstrasser, 2004; Nijman et al., 2005; Sulea et al., 2006) . USPs represent the most diverse class, comprising proteases with two short conserved motifs, the Cys and His boxes, flanked by N-and C-terminal regions of differing length and sequence. The UCH class contains small proteins originally identified by their ability to hydrolyze small amides and esters at the C terminus of Ub. The other classes have only been recognized recently and contain only a few members. Proteases have also been divided into families and clans according to a hierarchical classification on the basis of degree of similarity in amino acid sequence. Families of proteases that are homologous are grouped together in a clan. According to this system, cysteine proteases have been divided into 9 clans and 47 families (http://merops. sanger.ac.uk/index.htm).

Components of the T3S apparatus (which resembles a needle-like structure in both form and function; Galan and Wolf-Watz, 2006) are conserved in different pathogens; however, each pathogen is endowed with a unique repertoire of effectors that contribute to the disease processes caused by that pathogen.

Given the importance of ubiquitination and deubiquitination in the regulation of many cellular processes, it is not surprising that pathogenic bacteria have developed the means to interfere extensively with different stages of Ub pathways.

YopJ is present in all three Yersinia spp. pathogenic for humans; these bacteria are mainly extracellular pathogens causing both enteric diseases (Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica) and plague (Y. pestis). YopJ plays an important role in inhibiting the inflammatory response and inducing apoptosis in E1 enzymes activate the C terminus of ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent manner, which directs ubiquitin to an E2 enzyme. E3 ligases transfer ubiquitin either from the E2 to a thioester linkage on the E3, and then to the substrate, or by acting as adaptors that bind to E2 proteins and substrates separately, and facilitate direct transfer of Ub from the E2 protein to the substrate. Chains of four or more Ub molecules linked through lysine 48 (K48) of ubiquitin target the modified protein for proteasomal degradation, whereas K63-linked polyubiquitin chains regulate several cellular processes, such as DNA repair, signaling, endocytosis, vesicular trafficking, and cell-cycle progression. Ubiquitin deconjugation is a reversible process catalyzed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). These play an important role in processing Ub precursors, proofreading Ub protein conjugates, and removing Ub from substrate proteins. macrophages. By interfering with the NF-kB pathway through inhibition of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) kinases and IKKb, YopJ suppresses proinflammatory signaling via TNF and IL-8 production, as well as inducing apoptosis (Boland and Cornelis, 1998; Mills et al., 1997; Monack et al., 1997; Orth et al., 1999; Palmer et al., 1998; Yoon et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2004) . YopJ is a member of clan CE, family 55, and its substrate was originally thought to be SUMO-1, since expression of YopJ in mammalian cells decreased the cellular concentration of SUMO-1-conjugated proteins (Orth et al., 2000) . However, a subsequent study showed that purified YopJ cleaves Ub-amino methyl coumarin (Ub-AMC) (a fluorogenic Ub conjugate) but not SUMO-1-AMC in vitro . Furthermore, infection of macrophages with a Y. pseudotuberculosis strain expressing a mutant version of YopJ in which the catalytic cysteine was replaced by alanine resulted in the accumulation of ubiquitinated IkBa in the macrophage cytosol . Normally, activation of the NF-kB pathway leads to phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation of IkBa, which allows the translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus, where it regulates transcription of genes involved in proinflammatory signaling. Translocated YopJ was therefore proposed to act as a DUB for ubiquitinated IkBa, thereby preventing its degradation. However, YopJ is evidently not able to hydrolyze ubiquitinated IkBa in vitro (Collier-Hyams et al., 2002) . Furthermore, it has been shown recently by two groups that YopJ can function as an acetyltransferase in vitro by transferring acetyl groups to serine and threonine residues in the activation loop of MAPKK6, effectively preventing their phosphorylation and hence kinase activation (Bliska, 2006; Mittal et al., 2006; Mukherjee et al., 2006) . It is important to know if YopJ can cause similar modifications in vivo, since it is not immediately obvious how a loss of acetyltransferase activity on MAPKK6 would result in an accumulation of ubiquitinated IkBa in infected cells . However, these studies raise the possibility that YopJ is a bifunctional enzyme that acetylates one or more substrate and deubiquitinates another. Such relaxed substrate specificity of a bacterial enzyme would not be unprecedented: E. coli TAP is a multifunctional enzyme that has both protease and deacetylating activities (Lee et al., 2006) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1670, "end": 1697, "text": "(Boland and Cornelis, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1717, "text": "Mills et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1718, "end": 1738, "text": "Monack et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1757, "text": "Orth et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1758, "end": 1778, "text": "Palmer et al., 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1779, "end": 1797, "text": "Yoon et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1798, "end": 1816, "text": "Zhou et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 2025, "end": 2044, "text": "(Orth et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2899, "end": 2927, "text": "(Collier-Hyams et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3210, "end": 3224, "text": "(Bliska, 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3225, "end": 3245, "text": "Mittal et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 3246, "end": 3269, "text": "Mukherjee et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 3830, "end": 3848, "text": "(Lee et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 197, "end": 206, "text": "(Figure 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Bacterial Intervention"}, {"text": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is an invasive pathogen that colonizes the small intestine, and in the murine model of typhoid it penetrates the epithelium and transits from Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes to the spleen and liver, where it replicates in macrophages. Following invasion or phagocytosis by macrophages, the vast majority of intracellular S. enterica remain in a membrane-bound compartment, the Salmonellacontaining vacuole (SCV), which the bacteria modify to provide an environment favorable for replication. To invade host cells, Salmonella uses a T3S system encoded by the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1). This system translocates several effector proteins across the hostcell plasma membrane. Some of these remodel the actin cytoskeleton to cause localized membrane ruffling and bacterial uptake. Thereafter, another set of effectors is translocated across the vacuolar membrane. This is accomplished by the T3S system encoded by SPI-2, which translocates over 20 effectors, detectable approximately 4 hr following entry of bacteria. Together, these effector proteins enable bacterial replication in a variety of Review host-cell types and also induce a delayed cytotoxicity in macrophages (Kuhle and Hensel, 2004; Waterman and Holden, 2003) . Salmonellae that are both pathogenic and nonpathogenic for humans interfere with ubiquitination pathways. Whereas pathogenic Salmonella elicits an NF-kB-dependent proinflammatory response upon colonization of human intestinal epithelial cells in vitro, nonpathogenic strains are capable of suppressing this response. The inhibition does not affect the phosphorylation of IkBa but somehow affects its subsequent ubiquitination, and thereby prevents its degradation (Neish et al., 2000) .

How this leads to cytotoxicity remains to be established, but the study provides evidence that the cytotoxic activity of Salmonella is an important component of its virulence. It is tempting to speculate that the deubiquitinating activity of SseL might function to counteract ubiquitination and degradation of other translocated bacterial effectors by the host-cell machinery. However, this seems unlikely for two reasons. First, an important collective function of SPI-2 T3S system effectors is to enable intracellular growth (Waterman and Holden, 2003) and if SseL acted by protecting these effectors then an sseL mutant would be predicted to have an intracellular replication defect. Secondly, SseL has a clear preference for K63-linked Ub chains (Rytk\u00f6 nen et al., 2007) , indicating that it is likely to be involved in signaling events rather than interfering directly with protein degradation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 324, "end": 348, "text": "(Rytk\u00f6 nen et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1150, "text": "(Rytk\u00f6 nen et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1845, "end": 1872, "text": "(Waterman and Holden, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 2068, "end": 2092, "text": "(Rytk\u00f6 nen et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 349, "end": 359, "text": "(Figure 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Review"}, {"text": "Shigella flexneri is an important cause of human bacillary dysentery. The morphological features of Shigella entry into epithelial cells are similar to those induced by S. Typhimurium, and although both require T3S systems, the effector protein repertoire and infection process following invasion are distinct. S. flexneri invades the colonic epithelium initially through M cells of Peyer's patches. Bacteria then interact with macrophages in the lymphoid follicle, and enterocytes via their basolateral membranes. These interactions result in a strong proinflammatory response that exacerbates infection of the intestinal epithelium. However, it has become clear that stimulation of proinflammatory responses is subsequently modulated by the action of several bacterial effectors (Arbibe et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2005) . OspG is one of approximately 20 effectors delivered to the host cells by the Shigella T3S system. A yeast two-hybrid screen showed that OspG interacts with ubiquitinylated E2 molecules, including UbcH5b (Figure 2) . OspG was shown to have kinase activity but evidently does not phosphorylate E2 proteins. Nevertheless, OspG can block TNF-induced IkBa degradation, a process that is dependent on UbcH5b (Kim et al., 2005) . This effect requires a lysine residue important for kinase activity of OspG and suggests that OspG acts at the step of phospho-IkBa ubiquitination. Possibly, OspG acts by phosphorylating a component of SCF b-TrCP in the context of OspG-UbcH5b. The biochemical evidence for dampening of the inflammatory response is supported by the phenotype of an ospG mutant, which induced a much stronger inflammatory response during infection of rabbit ileal loops (Kim et al., 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 781, "end": 802, "text": "(Arbibe et al., 2007;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 803, "end": 820, "text": "Kim et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1243, "text": "(Kim et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1716, "text": "(Kim et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1026, "end": 1036, "text": "(Figure 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Shigella"}, {"text": "IpaH9.8 is another effector delivered by Shigella into host cells, where it translocates to the nucleus (Haraga and Miller, 2003; Toyotome et al., 2001) .

Its biochemical characterization was achieved by using Saccharomyces both as a host for an initial phenotypic screen, and then to identify its target and biochemical function. IpaH9.8 was shown to interfere with the pheromone response signaling pathway by ubiquitinating the MAPKK Ste7, which leads to its proteasome-dependent destruction (Rohde et al., 2007) . Work from another group has shown that, in mammalian cells, IpaH9.8 interacts with U2AF 35 -a component of an essential pre-mRNA splicing factor complex (Okuda et al., 2005) . Deletion of ipaH9.8 resulted in increased proinflammatory cytokine production and, consistent with the hypothesis that IpaH9.8 might interfere with the function of U2AF 35 , reduction of U2AF 35 expression by siRNA-mediated knockdown caused a decrease in the expression of these cytokines (Okuda et al., 2005) . It would be interesting to know if IpaH9.8 can ubiquitinate U2AF 35 , which might help to reconcile the results from these two studies. The finding that IpaH9.8 is an E3 ligase has broader implications, since homologous proteins with similar domain organization and containing a critical cysteine residue are found not only in Shigella but also in several other bacterial pathogens. These proteins include Salmonella SspH1, an effector of both the SPI-1 and SPI-2 T3S systems.

CNF1 functions by deamidating a specific glutamine residue of Rho GTPases to glutamate. This prevents endogenous or induced GTPase activity of these molecu-lar switches, effectively locking them into a permanently active state. However, this effect is only transient, as the host cell responds by depleting the modified GTPases by ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation (Doye et al., 2002) . Hence, although the immediate effect of CNF1 deamidation of Rho proteins is their activation, the long-term consequence is ubiquitination and degradation.

Interaction between Met and its ligand normally triggers the recruitment of the Ub ligase Cbl, which ubiquitinates Met and leads to its endocytosis. It was found recently that InlB can mediate the same process, and furthermore that the Ub-dependent endocytosis machinery is required for internalization of bacteria (Veiga and Cossart, 2005) . While the interaction between InlB and ubiquitination machinery is indirect, this discovery reveals another means by which bacterial pathogens harness host Ub-dependent pathways to promote their virulence. Following uptake into host cells, L. monocytogenes escapes its vacuole and begins to replicate and spread in the host-cell cytosol. This is dependent on the action of the secreted cytolysin listeriolysin O (LLO). LLO is potentially damaging to the host-cell plasma membrane, and to ensure that bacteria remain intracellular, the activity of LLO must be restricted to the vacuolar membrane.

As with animal pathogens, the processes of activation, conjugation, and deconjugation of Ub and Ubls all appear to be targeted by bacterial effector proteins. VirF of Agrobacterium is one of several proteins involved in transfer of T-DNA from this bacterium into plant cells. It localizes to the plant cell nucleus, where it causes the degradation of a plant protein VIP1. This is thought to be mediated by an F box motif in VirF that binds the plant homolog of Skp1, a component of SCF in some E3 ligase complexes (Tzfira et al., 2004) . AvrPtoB is a T3S effector translocated into tomato cells by Pseudomonas syringae, where it inhibits hypersensitivity-a plant immune response involving rapid localized host-cell death at the site of infection. The amino acid sequence of AvrPtoB provided no information as to its function, but the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of AvrPtoB revealed striking similarity to U box and RING finger components of E3 ligases (Janjusevic et al., 2006) . Purified AvrPtoB was shown to have E3 ligase activity in vitro, and putative E2 binding site residues were shown to be critical for suppression of the plant hypersensitive response (Janjusevic et al., 2006) . Presumably, AvrPtoB recruits E2 partners and substrates and transfers Ub to host-cell proteins(s) that positively regulate the plant defense response.

XopD appears to have a strict preference for plant SUMOs and was recently used to obtain insight into substrate specificity of ULPs (Chosed et al., 2007) .

Both the Herpes and Poxvirus families encode proteins with E3 ligase activity. These E3 ligases promote ubiquitination of MHC-1, B7.2, ICAM-1, and CD4, resulting in removal of these cell surface molecules and obstruction of host immune responses (Coscoy et al., 2001; Duncan et al., 2006; Hewitt et al., 2002; Mansouri et al., 2003) .

Although the current list of bacterial effectors involved in these processes is relatively short, they would appear to fall into three general categories: those that act directly on pathways by ''mimicking'' host-cell proteins (e.g., E3 ligases and DUBs), those that act indirectly (e.g., E. coli CNF1 and Shigella OspG), and those that are themselves subject to ubiquitination in ways that influence bacterial virulence (e.g., Salmonella SopE). Much of our (albeit limited) understanding of this aspect of bacterial virulence has been gained in the last few years, and it therefore seems likely that the number of bacterial proteins that either mimic or modulate host-cell proteins involved in Ub pathways will increase considerably in the future. Of the bacterial DUBs that have been identified to date, none have the same architecture as the ''classic'' eukaryotic DUBs (clan CA); they are all members of clan CE proteases. As our knowledge of the clan organization of DUBs and ULPs increases (Hotson and Mudgett, 2004) , it will become easier to identify putative new Ub-or ULPspecific proteases among both plant and animal pathogens. However, identifying new modifiers of the Ub conjugation machinery is unlikely to be straightforward, since the bacterial E3 ligases identified to date do not display striking amino acid sequence similarities, either between themselves or with their mammalian counterparts. A major problem is that the targets of most of these bacterial effectors are currently unknown, and identifying them can be fraught with difficulty: many of these effectors are very potent, are produced transiently, and localize to specific regions of the infected cell. Specificity could therefore be achieved by precise spatiotemporal control of effector delivery rather than being an intrinsic property of the effectors. The controversial literature regarding the function of YopJ emphasizes the need for careful biochemical analysis of putative cysteine proteases to reveal their physiological functions in vivo. Ideally, this involves the study of the protein in the natural context of infection, as opposed to analysis following its overexpression either in vitro or in vivo, but obviously this is not feasible in many instances. Notwithstanding these concerns, the growing literature on bacterial manipulation of Ub pathways reflects a very important and widespread aspect of bacterial pathogenesis, and future research in this area will provide exciting new insights into the mechanisms underlying bacterial virulence.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 43, "end": 69, "text": "(Boyer and Lemichez, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 70, "end": 89, "text": "Angot et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1304, "text": "(Hotson and Mudgett, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Mechanism and function of deubiquitinating enzymes", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["Y"], "last": "Amerik", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Hochstrasser", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "Biochim.
