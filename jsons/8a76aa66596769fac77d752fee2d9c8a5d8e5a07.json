Public administration and media should be honest and responsible in order to facilitate public awareness as well as reduce false rumors that can cause widespread panic and unease.

Now that quarantine is being lifted in many parts of China, many are still understandably wary of seeking in-person health care. We must consider strategies to encourage those with health issues needing management to seek outpatient care, as well as continue to provide telemedicine support. Meanwhile, health care providers should be aware that pain may be related to COVID-19 infection 11 in a variety of forms as we discussed in our cases-as an early sign of infection, or as a sequela of infection and iatrogenic effects such as prolonged bedrest and psychological stress. Of course, pain may very well be a manifestation of a non-COVID-19 related process. These patients can be better served with our improved strategies of pain management. We may prepare ourselves to see more patients who previously had COVID-19 infection visiting pain clinic as the epidemic slows.",

            "text": "diagnosed with COVID-19 infection was a 61 year old woman with a chief complaint of chest and lower back pain. This was at the end of December 2019, almost a month before the lockdown of Wuhan and the national quarantine. Tests were ordered to rule out chest pain of cardiovascular or lung origin, among other etiologies. Her back pain was assessed and she subsequently received minimally invasive surgery for her back pain. Three days post-operatively (about a week after being admitted for treatment), the patient developed sudden onset fever of 39-40\u00b0C and was diagnosed with pneumonia, with CT images showing bilateral lung opacities. This diagnosis was later confirmed as COVID-19 induced pneumonia after nucleic acid testing became available. In early February, the patient had recovered and was discharged from the hospital with much improved lung images and negative nucleic acid test results. However, within a week after the patient had been diagnosed with pneumonia, five medical workers and four patients who had had close contact with this patient developed clinical symptoms of COVID-19 infection and later tested positive. Until this episode, the hospital had taken no preventative precautions related to COVID-19. This series of events provided a shocking lesson to our department and the local health care system in Wuhan. The second case is a 75 year old man who presented to the same Wuhan pain clinic with severe lumber pain in February. He was diagnosed with compression fracture of the lumbar spine with osteoporosis and was immediately admitted to the hospital and received surgery under local anesthesia. Three days after surgery, the patient developed a fever of 38.5\u00b0C with lung CT images suspicious for viral pneumonia. This patient was moved to the isolation ward and subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. The good news for this case was that none of the physicians, nurses, or other health care providers who had close contact with this patient got infected. At this point in time, precautionary measures had already been implemented in the hospital, including consistent use of personnel protective equipment. In the past three months, there have been no COVID-19 infections among patients or staff in the Wuhan pain department. Among thousands of outpatients the department has seen in the past couple of months, several dozens of patients presenting with body pain without the usual symptoms of respiratory viral illness, who then tested positive for COVID-19. Thus, body pain can be an early symptom of COVID-19 infection.",
