            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus that causes respiratory disease in chickens. Infectious bronchitis (IB) disease signs include respiratory distress, reduced weight, reduced egg production, increased frequency of abnormal eggs and increased rates of mortality (Cavanagh & Gelb, 2008). Several different serotypes and genotypes of IBVs have been identified and new variants are still emerging. One of these new variants is QX-like IBV. Wang et al. (1998) were the first to isolate IBV QX-like virus from a flock of chickens suffering with proventriculitis in China. Later on, the virus was reported more frequently in relation to cases of nephritis and false layer syndrome (Benyeda et al.,\n2009). QX-like IBVs were detected in East Russia in 2001 and in 2002 in West Russia (Bochkov et al., 2006). From 2003 onwards, IB QX-like viruses were detected in many countries in Europe: Germany, Holland, Belgium, France, Italy (Monne et al., 2008; Worthington et al., 2008), Poland (Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2006), the UK (Gough et al., 2008) and Spain (Dolz et al., 2009). Various sources report that IB QX-like viruses are currently present in all European countries. Clearly, IB QX-like viruses pose a serious threat to the poultry industry. No vaccines specific for IB QX-like viruses are yet available. In the present paper the development of a live attenuated IB QX-like vaccine virus based on strain IB L1148 is described and the results of studies on safety and efficacy are discussed. Most of the tests described here were performed in accordance with the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia (EP) monograph 01/2008:442, to which reference should be made for more detail of specific requirements.",

The RNA was used in a reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a one-step RT-PCR kit from Invitrogen, in which the RNA underwent a cDNA synthesis step for 30 min at 50\u00b0C, followed by an initial denaturation step for 10 min at 95\u00b0C. Forty repeat steps of denaturation for 30 sec at 95\u00b0C, annealing for 30 sec at 50\u00b0C and extension for 45 sec at 72\u00b0C were performed. The final extension step had a duration of 7 min at 72\u00b0C and the reaction was stopped by incubation of the PCR mixture for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The IB L1148-specific primer sequences used were 5\u2032-GCTTATGCAGTAGTCAAT-3\u2032 as forward primer and 5\u2032-CACGTGGAATCATGCCTGTTAT-3\u2032 as reverse primer. These primers were designed from the nucleotide sequence of the hypervariable region of the S1 protein of strain IB L1148, NCBI Genbank accession number DQ431199 (Worthington et al., 2008). The specificity of the primers had been tested in a PCR with RNA from IB strains H120, D274 and M41. No PCR product was formed from the RNA of these IB strains. After completion of the RT-PCR reaction, the size of the PCR product was determined by agarose-gel electrophoresis. The fragments were stained with ethidium bromide and their position viewed under ultraviolet light. Their size was calculated by comparing the position of the bands with base pair markers that had also been loaded on the gel.",

A dose of 106.0 EID50 was used in the safety tests for the respiratory tract and kidneys, because the EP requires testing 10 times the maximum release titre for safety of the respiratory tract, and testing the maximal release titre in the test for safety of the reproductive tract. It was anticipated that a dose of 105.0 EID50 would be the maximal titre for the vaccine. In Experiment A we tested egg passage levels 8, 25, 40 and 50, and in Experiment B we tested egg passage levels 65 and 80. In each test, a non-infected control group was included. Five chickens were killed humanely 5 days after inoculation, by inhalation of 100% carbon dioxide, another five birds at 7 days after inoculation and the remaining five birds at 10 days after inoculation. The ciliostasis test was performed in accordance with the EP. Briefly, the trachea was removed, rinsed and stored in physiological saline at 37\u00b0C. Transverse sections of 0.6 mm of the trachea were made using a McIlwain Tissue Chopper (Mickle Laboratory Engineering Co. Ltd, Surrey, UK). The ciliary activity of three, four and three sections of, respectively, the upper, middle and lower part of the trachea was determined by light microscopy at a magnification of 400\u00d7. A score of 0 was given if the cilia in the complete tracheal section showed movement; a score of 1 was given if the cilia of 67% to 100% of the tracheal section showed movement; a score of 2 if the cilia of 33% to 67% of the trachea showed movement; a score of 3 if the cilia of less than 33% but not 0% of the tracheal section showed movement; and a score of 4 if the cilia in the complete tracheal section showed no movement at all. For each group, the average ciliostasis score was calculated. Gross pathological examination was done on the kidneys of each chicken used for the ciliostasis test. During the examination, some samples of the kidneys were taken for further histological examination and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. In some instances it was considered necessary to take additional samples for histology and IHC staining. The samples were preserved by fixation in formalin. Kidney lesions were scored as follows: \u2013, no lesions; +, some infiltration of lymphocytes locally; ++, strong infiltration of lymphocytes through whole kidney; + + +, strong infiltration of lymphocytes, some necrosis of epithelia in tubuli, atrophic foci. Histological examination was performed by the Animal Health Service.",

The samples of the passage levels 82 and 85 were lyophilized; the samples of passage level 101 were frozen allantoic fluid. IB strain L1148 at passage levels 82 and 85 was chosen to test its efficacy as a vaccine against challenge with a virulent IB QX-like virus, because we took into account that passage level 80 would most probably be the passage level of the master seed virus. In order to be able to produce a vaccine from the master seed virus, a few passages are required to scale up the virus. Passage 101 was tested to investigate whether higher passage levels would also be efficacious. Vaccine titres per dose of 103.0 and 103.3 EID50 were chosen because it was anticipated that a vaccine based on the attenuated IB L1148 strain would have a minimal titre of 103.0 or 103.3 EID50 per dose. The freeze-dried vaccines were reconstituted in distilled water. Reconstituted virus and the allantoic fluid of passage 101 were further diluted to the appropriate titre in distilled water. The chickens were vaccinated by coarse spray using a Hozelock flower sprayer. Generation of pressure and flow had been determined before vaccination began. The sprayer had a flow rate of approx. 2.5 ml/sec. Before vaccination, the exact vaccination time for the applicable number of birds was determined (0.5 ml per bird) and the sprayer was disinfected with 70% ethanol, followed by three rinses with distilled water. After preparation, the container with the diluted vaccine was placed in a water bath with melting ice. Just before vaccination the vaccine was put into the sprayer and the sprayer was put under pressure by moving the pump up and down 40 times. Prior to vaccination, it was tested for flow. The chicks, which had been placed in a small box, were vaccinated by spraying the vaccine from a height of 40 to 50 cm for the predetermined period. After spraying, the chicks were kept for at least 15 min inside the box. Subsequently, the chicks were released into their housing facilities. A non-vaccinated group served as control. At 21 days of age, 20 chickens taken from each group were challenged with 104.0 EID50 IB D388 per dose of 0.1 ml. The challenge virus was applied by eye-drop. Of the non-vaccinated group, one-half was challenged and the other half was not challenged. During the whole study period the chickens were observed daily for clinical signs. Five days after challenge, the ciliary activity of tracheal explants was examined in 20 chickens per vaccine group and in 10 chickens per control group. Chickens were killed by injecting sodium pentobarbital (T61) intravenously. Immediately after death the trachea was removed and rinsed with, and stored in, physiological saline at 37\u00b0C. Small transverse sections of the trachea were cut by hand. Ciliary activity of three sections of the upper part, four sections of the middle part and three sections of the lower part of the trachea were examined by light microscopy at a magnification of 400\u00d7. The ciliary activity was scored as described in the EP monograph using the following classification criteria: 1 if \u226550% of the tracheal section showed ciliary activity, and 0 if <50% of the tracheal section showed ciliary activity. For a given tracheal section, ciliary activity was considered normal when at least 50% (score 0) of the internal ring showed vigorous ciliary movement. A chicken was considered protected if no fewer than nine out of 10 rings showed normal ciliary activity. Significance of differences between groups was evaluated by chi-square analysis.",

Passage 8 of strain IB L1148 had a maximum average ciliostasis score at 5 and 7 days after vaccination, and a score of 38 at 10 days, which gives a total average score of 39 (Table 1). There was a strong decrease in average score to 18 at passage level 25. Surprisingly, there were increases in ciliostasis score at passage levels 40 and 50. Passage 50 had an average score of 31. At passage levels 65 and 80 there was a decrease in ciliostasis scores to 21 and 11, respectively. The highest average ciliostasis scores were observed at 7 days after vaccination, with the exception of passage level 25 that had the highest value at day 10. In a number of instances there were great differences between individual values in one group; for example, with passage 25 at day 5, three chickens had a high ciliostasis score whereas the other two had scores of 0. No ciliostasis at all was observed in the uninoculated groups. The results presented in Table 2 show that in Study A in which passage levels 8, 25, 40 and 50 were tested, some kidneys were affected macroscopically; one at 5 days after vaccination with passage level 50, and several at day 10 in the groups inoculated with each virus. The kidneys were swollen and pale. No gross pathological lesions were recorded in study B in which passage levels 65 and 80 were tested. Passage levels 8, 25, 40 and 50 of IB L1148 affected the kidneys histologically, but there was a decrease in the severity of the lesions in the kidneys with increasing passage level. Passage levels 8 and 25 caused quite severe lesions; scores being ++ until 10 days after vaccination in both groups, and likewise at 5 days after vaccination with passage level 40. At higher passage levels, lesion scores were never higher than +. Lesion scores of + + + were not observed in any group. Passage level 65 hardly caused any effect on the kidneys histologically, and passage level 80 had no effect. The kidneys in the uninoculated group were normal. In the IHC test, IB antigen could be detected frequently in the kidneys from chickens inoculated with lower passage 8 (i.e. in total, in nine of the 15 samples tested). In the kidneys from the chickens with the higher passage levels, IBV could be detected less frequently. In both passages 65 and 80, IB was detected in only one sample.\n\n",

The classical procedure for attenuation of IBVs is by passage in embryonated eggs (MacDonald & McMartin, 1976; Klieve & Cummings, 1988; Jackwood et al., 2003; Huang & Wang, 2006, 2007; Liu et al., 2007). In our studies, 80 passages were required to achieve a virus strain that was attenuated sufficiently to comply with safety requirements for live IB vaccines. This is in line with the number of passages required to attenuate other IB strains. It is not known what type of mechanism causes a virus to attenuate. Huang & Wang (2007) sequenced the 3' 7.3 kb of the genome of an attenuated and parent virus strain from which an attenuated strain was derived. They found that there were amino acid substitutions in the spike 1 and 2 subunits, the small membrane protein and the membrane protein. No substitutions were detected in the nucleoprotein. We sequenced a substantial part of the genomic region coding for the hypervariable region of the S1 protein or our strain (Worthington et al., 2008). In comparison with the parent field isolate there were no more than four substitutions in 1424 nucleotides, resulting in two amino acid substitutions. The substitutions we detected were different from those found by Huang & Wang (2007). The role of these substitutions remains unclear.",

There was a clear decrease in ciliostasis scores after 25 passages, followed by an increase until passage level 50. After 50 passages, ciliostasis scores decreased again. To our knowledge this effect has not been reported before. At passage level 80 a ciliostasis score of 11 was determined, which is much lower than the maximum score of 40, often found with virulent IB strains, therefore the virulence of the virus strain for the respiratory tract has been decreased significantly. There is no threshold defined to distinguish safe IB strains from an unsafe one. In the EP monograph, an average value of 25 has been indicated for many years as the threshold, but nowadays the requirement is that a risk\u2013benefit analysis should be made, taking into account the average ciliostasis score and the benefits expected from the use of the vaccine. The average ciliostasis score for passage level 80 was well below the threshold of 25. Kidney lesions also decreased to very low levels at passage 80, and virus could be detected in the kidneys on only one occasion. These results clearly demonstrate that the virus was attenuated during passaging and the data for passage level 80 can be considered in compliance with requirements in the EP, with respect to safety for the respiratory tract and kidneys.",

Cavanagh (2005) mentioned the Harderian gland, trachea, oesophagus, lung, kidney, oviduct, duodenum, caecum, rectum, ileum and bursa as potential sites of replication of IBV. We recovered the virus from pancreas and trachea, and from cloacal and oro-pharyngeal swabs. In the contact birds that were infected by spreading of the virus from the vaccinated chickens, we found that oro-pharyngeal swabs were often virus-positive, whereas in the tracheal tissues the virus could no longer be detected. This may be because the cells producing the virus had been destroyed, whereas the virus that was produced from these cells was still present. It is possible also that the PCR test was more sensitive than the IHC staining method. Furthermore, it has to be said that the PCR test detects genomic material of the virus\u2014that is, a part of the genomic region coding for the hypervariable region of the S1 protein\u2014whereas the IHC staining method is based on the reactivity of a monoclonal antibody with the nucleoprotein of the virus. The observed presence of the virus in trachea and pancreas suggest that this attenuated IB L1148 strain at passage level 80 has the trachea and the alimentary tract as main sites of replication. Replication of IBV in the trachea is a common finding and replication in the alimentary tract has also been described (Wang et al., 1998), but this is not the case for replication of IBV in pancreatic tissue. Qian et al. (2006) isolated an IBV from sick pigeons; and when the isolated virus was inoculated into SPF chickens, pancreatitis developed. We did not observe any abnormalities in the pancreatic tissue in the dissemination study. In the other safety studies, we likewise did not observe any abnormalities that could be attributed to IBV infection in the pancreas. Thus, there is no evidence that the attenuated IB L1148 strain has a damaging effect on the pancreas. It has to be mentioned that the IHC test detects the presence of epitope 48.4 of the nucleoprotein of the IBV (Koch et al., 1991). More research will need to be done to confirm that the virus replicates in the pancreas.",

No signs of disease were observed in the contact chickens of the same age as the vaccinated chickens or in the younger contact chickens. It is common knowledge that IB vaccine viruses can spread from vaccinated to non-vaccinated chickens (Hopkins & Yoder, 1984), so the results described in this paper are not surprising. Just as for other IB vaccine viruses, it is strongly recommended to ensure that if a flock is vaccinated then all birds are vaccinated directly to avoid rolling reactions.",

The degree of protection in the SPF chickens was higher than that in the MDA-positive chickens. This can be a consequence of the presence of MDA, which may have had a negative impact on vaccine efficacy. However, a direct comparison between the SPF chickens and the MDA-positive chickens is difficult, because genetic differences between the chicken lines may also have had an effect on the susceptibility of the chickens to the IB challenge (Ignjatovic et al., 2003). The MDA will have been directed against the Massachusetts, 4/91 and D274 types of IB, because the parent birds had been vaccinated with these IB vaccines, but it cannot be excluded that the MDA was directed against IB QX-like viruses also, because of possible field infections. It has to be said that the MDA-positive chickens came from France, where IB QX-like viruses are prevalent (Worthington et al., 2008).",

In order to find ways to protect poultry against IB QX-like viruses, combinations of existing vaccine strains have been tested. For example, Terregino et al. (2008) vaccinated chickens with the IB Ma5 vaccine strain at 1 day of age and with IB 4/91 vaccine strain at 14 days of age. At 5 weeks of age the chickens were challenged with an IB QX-like virus, isolated in northern Italy in 2005 (IBV QX-like virus 1997/V05). The results of that study show that combined vaccination with IB Ma5 and IB 4/91 conferred protection against IB QX-like virus challenge. It is not unusual for chickens to be vaccinated with different combinations of vaccines to generate broad protection. A consequence of the use of combinations of vaccine viruses, not related to the virus that has to be controlled, may result in a situation in which new virus strains (i.e. the vaccine strains) are introduced in the environment. This is not the case if a vaccine derived directly from the field virus is used. In this respect, the use of such vaccine virus strains is advantageous. However, other aspects, such as degree of attenuation and interactions and compatibilities with other vaccines, also should be taken into account.",
