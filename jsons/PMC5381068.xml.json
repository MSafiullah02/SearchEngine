In some remote regions of Australia, Indigenous infants present on average at least once a fortnight to community clinics and acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) are the most common reason for attendance [2]. Indigenous children are 2.6 times more likely to present to emergency departments (ED) with ARI [3] and twice as likely to be hospitalised for an ARI than non-Indigenous children [1]. However, respiratory research in Indigenous children has predominantly focused on remote-based children [4, 5], although the majority of Indigenous children live in urban or inner regional areas of Australia, with Brisbane having the largest of those communities [6]. There is a conspicuous lack of current data on ARI and related respiratory microbes in urban Indigenous children at the community level and it is unknown whether it is similar to remote children or non-Indigenous children in urban settings. Further, cough is the most common symptom associated with health care utilisation amongst Australian children [7], including Indigenous children and, if present in ARI, is likely indicative of a lower ARI particularly if wet.",

However upper airway microbial data obtained from the nasopharynx are still considered important because they can provide important epidemiological information on the prevalence of, and temporal trends in, organisms within and between different populations. Knowing upper airway microbial epidemiology is particularly important to informing public health strategies such as vaccination. Increasingly co-detection of viruses with bacteria is considered important and a recent South African study reported 5 different types of organisms per episode were found in the upper airways of young children [9]. Yet, there are limited data on factors that are associated with virus and bacteria co-detection in Indigenous children, particularly those in urban settings.",

The two studies utilised the same specimen collection and laboratory methods and tested for the same organisms at the research laboratory. In both studies, S. pneumoniae followed by M.catarrhalis and NTHi were the dominant bacteria and rhinoviruses were the most common virus. B. pertussis, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were rare and influenza was uncommon. Respiratory syncytial virus was only observed in 4 % of children in this study but was detected in 17% of children in the ED study [14]. In that study, RSV was weakly associated with children being hospitalised [14] and its higher prevalence amongst ED children compared to community children possibly reflects the severity of illness if infected rather than community prevalence. The seasonal distribution of organisms was also similar to that identified in the ED study [13], including a predominance of the autumn months for NTHi and RSV and that virus-bacteria codetection occurred predominantly in autumn and winter.",

            "text": "In a study of upper airway viruses and bacteria in Central Australian Aboriginal children hospitalised for pneumonia [8], a population with high rates of hospitalised lower ARI [15] and nasal colonisation [16], the overall prevalence of any organism was 94.5%, with 34.5% positive for both viruses and bacteria. The prevalences of S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis and NTHi were 64%, 70.3% and 76.5% respectively [8]. That study differed from the two Brisbane studies in that the NT study focused on children hospitalised with pneumonia rather than non-severe ARIwC, different specimen collection techniques were used, the PCR for bacteria was performed at a different laboratory and the Central Australian study was undertaken prior to widespread implementation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. However, more recent community based studies of nasopharyngeal carriage of these bacteria in the Northern Territory in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era identified prevalences of 77% for S. pneumoniae, 45% for M. catarrhalis and 63% for NTHi [16]. Viruses were not reported in that study. In a Western Australian study of asymptomatic rural Aboriginal children that included testing for the same viruses as our study with the exception of bocavirus and the polyomaviruses [17], viruses were detected in 41% of children (most commonly rhinoviruses: 23.6%). Thus our data suggest that viral infection may be comparable between urban and remote Indigenous children however bacterial carriage is likely to be higher in remote children.",

The reasons why we found so few virus-only detections are uncertain, particularly given few data in the literature that have tested for the same spectrum of organisms by PCR that was undertaken in this study. Both swabs were from children with ARIwC at the time of testing but the clinical significance of virus only detections is unknown. A recent study of respiratory viruses (n = 15) detected by PCR in 560 paediatric episodes of ARI reported 457 episodes were virus positive, of which 331 were single infections and 126 were multiple infections; testing was undertaken for only two bacteria (C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae) [18].

            "text": "We found no relationship between the child characteristics and virus-bacteria codetection other than gender. Notably there were no differences in codetection between children with and without ARIwC, although the lack of difference may be attributable to a secondary analysis of data and hence lack of power to identify important differences. However, there are limited studies that have evaluated a similar spectrum of organisms by PCR methods that included children with and without ARIwC at the community level. A Finnish study of 426 children aged 6 to 35 months with and without acute otitis media reported a number of associations between several viruses and fever, nasal congestion, rhinitis and cough [19]. M. catarrhalis in the presence of viruses was also associated with rhinitis, nasal congestion and cough [19]. In 161 Norwegian children attending two daycare centres over a 2-year period, nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were collected over 4 time points and analysed by PCR for B. pertussis, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae and 16 viruses [20]. Overall 43% of 343 specimens were positive for at least one virus and none were positive for the three bacteria. In 331 swabs collected from 355 children who underwent a clinical examination, 70% of children with clear signs of respiratory tract infection were virus positive, compared to 41% with mild findings and 30% in those who were asymptomatic (p < 0.001), with rhinovirus the most common virus detected in all 3 groups [20]. In a study of respiratory viruses in Alaska Native children hospitalised with acute lower respiratory infections and age-matched community controls, viruses were detected by PCR in NPS in 90% of 440 hospitalized children and 52% of 425 asymptomatic community controls, with rhinoviruses the most common in both groups [21]. Bacteria were not reported in that study. While comparisons between children across studies are problematic given differences in demographics, geography and study methods, our study and those above emphasise the complexity in assigning ARIwC causality based on nasal specimens in children given the high prevalence of multiple organisms in asymptomatic children. The probable exceptions are RSV, influenza virus and human metapneumovirus given their relatively strong association with severe ARI in children and a low prevalence in asymptomatic children in several studies [22]. As these viruses were uncommon in our study it was not possible to examine their role in symptomatic respiratory infections.",

Our study children differed from national Indigenous statistics with respect to the high prevalence of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and other household characteristics such as the high number of single parent households, low total annual household income and low levels of attendance at childcare [23]. Further, PCR detection of viruses and bacteria does not necessarily equate to active infection at the time of testing and simply provides an indication of recent exposure to the organism. Next generation sequencing holds promise for the improved detection and differentiation of respiratory pathogens [24]. however the tests are costly which currently limits the use of the technology in population-based studies.",
