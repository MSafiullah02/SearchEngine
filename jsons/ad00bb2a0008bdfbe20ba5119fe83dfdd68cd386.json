The pathogen was the novel corona virus (2019-n COV) (1, 2) . Imaging findings on chest CT of ground glass opacities with peripheral distribution were helpful for diagnosis of COVID-19 (3) and increased the role of radiology departments in this pandemic. Accordingly, radiologists and especially radiology technologists are among the first-line health care workers that might be exposed to patients with the COVID-19.",

The COVID-19 virus is profoundly infectious and transmitted within respiratory droplets, but there is doubt as to whether the virus can be transmitted by touching a surface (4) . The Iranian Society of Radiology created a guideline for the protection of patients and health care workers in outpatient imaging centers, including principles for the types of equipment and regularly sanitizing the radiology department along the guideline made by the WHO or CDC (5). These include preventing the waiting room from becoming crowded, installing a banner at the entrance of the department to inform patients of COVID-19 symptoms and disinfecting imaging equipment after each use. In the case of ultrasound, more attention should be paid to disinfecting the probes, the probe cables, the keyboard and touch screen, the gel tube, and any other area where there is hand-operated contact. For the ultrasound probe, it is better to cover the probe which can be done with latex gloves, and then disinfect the probe cover with 70% alcohol after each patient. Disposable glasses should be in a closed container so they can be taken out individually and without contamination of the rest of the glasses and after use. All trash cans must have doors. All masks, gloves, and gauges should be placed in the right buckets after use.",
