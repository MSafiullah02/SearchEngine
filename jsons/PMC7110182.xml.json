Seventy-one percent of the samples were from the ED or urgent care. The daily testing volume varied from 3 to 44 Figure 1. The average daily volume for the first 2 months and second 2 months were 15 and 25, respectively. Because the FilmArray instrument is designed for single-specimen throughput and requires 65 minutes of instrument time, we purchased 3 instruments that could run simultaneously 24 hours a day. The average and median TAT was 1.6 and 1.4 hours, respectively, with 82% completed in less than 2 hours and 95% in less than 3 hours Table 1. Before this molecular test was available, we sent respiratory viral testing to an on-site reference laboratory for DFA. DFA testing involved multiple handoff steps in our laboratory and specimen transport to the reference laboratory. DFA specimens were run in batches 3 or 4 times per day depending on the volume during respiratory virus season. The testing time was approximately 3 hours. During the same period 1 year previously, 1,399 DFAs for respiratory viruses were performed. The average and median TAT for DFA was 7 and 6.5 hours, respectively, with 2% completed in less than 3 hours (Table 1). The test volume of respiratory virus during the study period was almost doubled compared with the same period last year. During the study period, the instrument failed 4 times. The rate of failed testing, which included quality control failures, insufficient vacuum in the pouch, and pouch leaking, was 1.3%. The TAT was significantly longer when instruments or reagent pouches failed.",

In general, children with respiratory symptoms may not seek or be brought to medical attention immediately. A delay in laboratory testing may further prolong the interval between symptom onset and the administration of medication. For treatment benefits, we specifically followed patients (n = 97) who tested positive for influenza A or influenza B admitted to the ED during March 2012. The mean and median length of stay in the ED during the study period was 3.1 and 2.8 hours, respectively. In these 97 patients, respiratory viral results provided by FilmArray were available for 44 patients (45%) before they were discharged from the ED. In 50 patients (52%), positive results were called within 3 hours after discharge. The remaining 3 patients (3%) were notified of the results in more than 3 hours. Of the 97 patients, 22 patients (23%) were treated with oseltamivir in the ED, and 30 patients (31%) were given the prescription while they were in the ED.

It is simple and fully automated (sample in, result out), with a 65-minute TAT and a single-piece throughput platform. We implemented FilmArray in our core laboratory and ran the test 24/7 during this respiratory viral season. We started with 2 FilmArray instruments.

Adding 1% to 2% of pouch failure rate and additional quality control testing, the cost was approximately $115 per test. The test took approximately 5 minutes to perform, which was about the same amount of time required for packaging a sample to be sent to a reference laboratory. We did not add any FTE in the core laboratory with the addition of the test. The cost of sending a sample to the reference laboratory for respiratory viral testing by DFA was $98.26. The actual price of FilmArray was only slightly higher than that previous spent on respiratory viral testing. For the DFA testing performed in previous years, nasal wash was the preferred specimen type. The collection of a nasal wash sample resulted in the generation of aerosols, and therefore procedure rooms had to be closed for 30 minutes before the rooms could be used again. Replacing the nasal wash with a midturbinate swab increased efficiency by eliminating the 30-minute room closures. Because 71% of the respiratory viral testing samples were collected from the ED, we potentially saved 900 hours of ED room for the 2,537 respiratory viral tests performed. The cost savings could not be accurately calculated. However, in 1 report it was found that a 1-hour reduction in ED boarding time would result in $9,693 to $13,298 of additional daily revenue.18 In this report the calculation included patients who left without being seen, which represented 7% of all ED visits. The rate of patients who left without being seen at our institution is 0.6%, so opportunity cost savings in our institution are probably lower.",

Finally, because there is no interface with our computerized data entry system currently, we required 2 technologists to verify the reported results for clerical error reduction.

Patients with influenza A and B were treated rapidly and appropriately, which had not been possible using DFA. Detection of other viral agents assisted physicians in the differential diagnosis of respiratory syndromes and isolation of patients admitted to the hospital. Overall, we implemented a molecular-based efficient diagnostic test in our core laboratory for the first time, marking a new era in pediatric clinical laboratory medicine.",
