In the present study, the inhibitory effect of EGCg on bovine coronavirus (BCV) propagation in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells was investigated. EGCg at concentrations of less than 10 \u03bcg/mL did not show any cytotoxicity to MDBK cells. BCV propagation was significantly inhibited by pretreatment of the virus with EGCg (0.5-10 \u03bcg/mL) before virus inoculation in dose-dependent, incubation time-dependent and temperature-dependent manners. The antiviral effect of pretreating MDBK cells with EGCg on BCV propagation was much weaker than that of pretreating BCV with EGCg. The hemagglutination activity of BCV was also reduced by EGCg in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that EGCg possesses a distinct anti-BCV activity and strongly suggest that EGCg interferes with the adsorption of BCV to MDBK cells by the interaction of EGCg with BCV particles. EGCg may therefore be a useful candidate for controlling BCV infection more effectively.",

BCV is a member of the family Coronaviridae, which has been divided into three groups, initially on the basis of serological relatedness, but more recently on the basis of genome sequence similarities (Wu et al. 2003) . BCV is now conveniently classified into two groups, one is an enteric type isolated from the intestinal tract and the other is a respiratory type isolated from the upper respiratory tract (Hasoksuz et al. 2002) . The recently identified human severe acute respiratory syndrome virus is classified into group four of the Coronaviridae family. Infection with BCV causes severe diarrhea in neonatal calves and winter dysentery in cattle. Although many vaccine trials have been carried out (Mebus et al. 1973; Myers & Snodgrass 1982; Freitag et al. 1984) , BCV virions have been detected at relatively high rates throughout the year in nasal drip and fecal samples from vaccinated animals, even though virus neutralizing antibodies were detected in their sera (Clark 1993) . BCV is therefore now recognized to have a persistent infectivity in nature.",

            "text": "In the present study, we focused on EGCg as a candidate for a reagent against BCV infection in livestock animals. As shown in Fig. 2 , EGCg was proven to have anti-BCV activity when BCV was pretreated with EGCg at concentrations of 0.5-10 \u03bcg/mL, which showed no cytotoxic effects on MDBK cells. The effectiveness of EGCg depended on the period and temperature of pretreatment with BCV. In contrast, the effect of EGCg on the proliferation of BCV in EGCg-treated MDBK cells was not as effective as that found in EGCg-treated viruses, suggesting that the antiviral effect of EGCg mainly results from the interaction between EGCg molecules and virus particles (Fig. 2) . Bovine coronavirus has four major structural proteins: spike glycoprotein, hemagglutinin acetylesterase glycoprotein, membrane glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (Lai & Cavanagh 1997) . Of these, the spike glycoprotein is now accepted to be the major candidate for the protein that recognizes viral receptor(s) on cell surfaces (Popova & Zhang 2002) . At adsorption, spike glycoprotein may be cleaved at one site by host proteases, yielding N-terminal S1 and Cterminal S2 proteins by non-covalent attachment. After S1 protein binds to receptor molecules of the cell membrane, S2 proteins undergo conformational change enabling them to fuse to the membrane of target cells. The first step in viral infection is binding of the virus to target cells. Hemagglutination and hemadsorption have been used as assays for studying viruscell interaction, although the erythrocyte itself is not a target cell for virus infection. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the S1 protein has HA activity (Clark 1993; Zelus et al. 2003) . In order to confirm that EGCg acts on the first step of viral infection, the direct effect of EGCg on the HA activity of BCV was examined. As shown in Fig. 4 , HA activity decreased with decreases in the EGCg concentration and temperature of the reaction mixture of BCV and EGCg. Thus, it was strongly suggested that the antiviral activity of EGCg depends on the interaction between EGCg molecules and the S1 protein of BCV. Mechanisms of the antiviral effects of EGCg on other viruses, such as human HIV-1 and EBV, may not be so simple. In the case of HIV-1, EGCg inhibits the binding of the viral protein gp120 to cell-surface CD4 molecules by binding to CD4 (Kawai et al. 2003) and it also destroys virus particles by binding to the surface of the viral envelope (Yamaguchi et al. 2002) . EGCg also acts as an inhibitor of reverse transcriptase, viral transcription and activity of viral genome-coded protease (Nakane & Ono 1989; Nance & Shearer 2003) . In the case of EBV, EGCg blocks the initiation of the EBV lytic cascade of the target cells, P3 H1 cells, which have been infected persistently with this virus, by inhibiting the transcription of the EBV immediate-early gene (Chang et al. 2003) .",

            "text": "Inhibition of the adsorption of the influenza virus, which also has HA spike proteins on its viral envelope, to Madin-Darby canine kidney cells by EGCg has been previously reported. In a study by Nakayama et al. (1993) , it was found that EGCg quickly binds to the virus and agglutinates it at the same proteins as specific antibodies for the virus, and blocking of adsorption of the virus to Madin-Darby canine kidney cellular surfaces was observed by electron microscopy. In general, viral envelopes are composed of cellular phospholipid components, and HIV is not an exception to this. It is known that EGCg has a negative charge and is capable of non-specifically binding to viral receptors on the cell surface (Stein et al. 1991; Ikigai et al. 1993; Witvrouw & De Clercq 1997; Yamaguchi et al. 1997 ). In the present study, BCV propagation was suppressed in the EGCg treated-MDBK cells, which were cultured at 37\u00b0C for 90 min and then washed twice with PBS before virus inoculation; however, the direct reactivity of EGCg to MDBK cells might not be as strong as the direct reactivity of EGCg to BCV because the number of plaques of EGCg-treated virus was significantly lower than that of EGCg-treated MDBK cells, even at EGCg concentrations of 0.5 \u03bcg/ mL (Fig. 2) . These findings are supported by the result of a HA inhibition assay in which the HA activity of BCV was decreased to half of the negative control in the presence of EGCg at a concentration of 0.01 \u03bcg/mL (Fig. 4) . These results demonstrate that the interaction between EGCg and spike glycoprotein of BCV may play a pivotal role in the process of the inhibitory effect of EGCg. Although further examination is required, we concluded that the anti-BCV effect of EGCg is exerted by interaction between EGCg and BCV particles only in the first step of viral infection. The results for antiviral activities against HIV, EBV, influenza virus and BCV suggest that the mechanisms of the antiviral effects of EGCg differ from virus to virus and depends on the targeted cells in which viruses propagate.",
