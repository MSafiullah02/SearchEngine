The bioterrorism drill started when the ED received a radio report that multiple bomb casualties were being transported and would arrive in 15 minutes. The casualties were student volunteers from a local college who had simulated wound and burn injuries. The scenario was that a bomb had exploded in a crowd, dispersing a white substance. The hazardous material team (HAZMAT), fire, police, and ambulance personnel were deployed on scene.",
