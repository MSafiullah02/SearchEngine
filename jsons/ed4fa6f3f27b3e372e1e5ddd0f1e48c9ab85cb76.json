However, the ophthalmological implications of this syndrome has not yet been well described. Both eyes and tears as portals of entry and sources of contagion have been the subject of debate by many authors. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence currently available on COVID-19 and its ocular implications and manifestations, in both animals and humans, with the aim to facilitate prevention and educate the ophthalmological community on this subject. A review of the literature revealed that the results of some studies suggest that ocular symptoms commonly appear in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and that it is possible to isolate the virus from the conjunctival sac of these patients. Conjunctivitis is not a common manifestation of the disease, but contact with infected eyes could be one route of transmission. Consequently, ophthalmologists need to have correct prevention strategies in place. Some guidelines regarding the prevention and management of ophthalmology clinics are reviewed. However, well-designed trials should be conducted to rule out other ocular manifestations that may result from COVID-19 infection and to understand the transmission of the virus through the eyes.",

Therefore, taking into consideration that there are more reports in the literature associating coronavirus and ophthalmic problems, the aim of this narrative review is to summarize, from an ophthalmological perspective, the pathogeny, the portal of entry and implantation of the virus at the conjunctiva, its ophthalmic implications, ocular complications, prevention in the ophthalmology context and possible treatment of the ocular disease. The relationship between COVID-19 and the ocular surface (conjunctiva, corneal epithelium and tear film) as a potencial portal of entry and as a transmission mechanism is currently under discussion due to the high transmission rate of the disease.",

The different infection sites are likely to be related to the presence of a viral surface spike composed of a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 glycoprotein that has a human receptor in the lower respiratory tract, known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have this surface spike glycoprotein [32] [33] [34] .",

In general, hypercytokinemias consist of a group of disorders that produce an elevation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines are an important cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure [38] [39] [40] . One analysis of the first 99 cases of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that a cytokine storm occurred in patients with severe COVID-19, of whom 17% had ARDS; among the latter patients, 11% deteriorated very rapidly and died of multiple organ failure [41] . In addition, the number of T cells (CD4 and CD8) are decreased in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a decreased immune function that subsequently allows a secondary infection that could worsen the respiratory failure [42] .",

Therefore, reducing the viral load on surfaces by disinfection is very important. The World Health Organization recommends cleaning environmental surfaces with water and detergent and applying commonly used disinfectants, such as sodium hypochlorite [63] . Bleach is typically used at a dilution of 1:100 of 5% sodium hypochlorite, resulting in a final concentration of 0.05% [64] . It has also been suggested that a concentration of 0.1% is effective in 1 min. It therefore seems appropriate to recommend a dilution 1:50 of standard bleach in the coronavirus setting. In case of small surface desinfection, ethanol (62-71%) has shown an efficacy against coronavirus [62, 64] . Other biocidal agents, such as 0.05-0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective [65] . Duan et al. found that irradiation with ultraviolet light for 60 min on several coronaviruses in culture medium resulted in undetectable levels of viral infectivity.",

As a coronavirus, it can also cause systemic infections in the form of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease. HAdV causes lytic infection of the mucoepithelial cells of the conjunctiva and cornea, as well as latent infection of lymphoid and adenoid cells. Despite it being the most common ophthalmological viral infection, there is no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved antiviral for treating HAdV keratoconjunctivitis. Therefore, managing viral persistance and dissemination constitute a challenge. Some treatment modalities have been investigated, such as systemic and topical antivirals, in-office povidone-iodine irrigation, immunoglobulin-based therapy, anti-inflammatory therapy and immunotherapy. Other posible therapeutic options are sialic acid analogs, cold atmospheric plasma, Nchlorotaurine and benzalkonium chloride [68] .",

Some of the general ophthalmic recommendations for viral conjunctivitis could apply to COVID-19 patients in terms of reducing both the transmission rate and possible complications; these include hygienic measures (frequent hand washing, especially when eye drops need to be applied or contact lens are worn; avoiding touching or rubbing the eyes; changing pillowcases, sheets, towels, regularly; not sharing personal items, etc.).",
