Such episodes occurred in 1918, when the influenza A subtype H1N1 was first identified in human beings, causing the Spanish flu pandemic, with mortality estimated at 40 million deaths or more worldwide2 and again in 2009, when a related H1N1 virus caused a pandemic derived by a triple reassortment of genes from swine, avian, and human influenza viruses.3, 4, 5 This type of adaptation of animal influenza viruses to man represents a global threat to public health.6 Another example of zoonotic spread includes the highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 viruses, which cause morbidity and mortality in bird populations and have caused sporadic human disease. WHO, as of June 16, 2011, has reported 561 confirmed human H5N1 cases and 328 deaths.7 In addition to representing a highly pathogenic strain, the absence of background H5N1 immunity in the general population makes the H5 antigen ideal for the assessment of novel influenza vaccine approaches.",

These antibodies are directed against well defined antigenic sites in the globular head region of influenza haemagglutinin, and are largely strain-specific.8, 9 HAI titres of 1:40 or more are typically associated with at least a 50% reduction in the risk of infection with strain specific influenza viruses in human beings.10 By contrast, neutralising antibody assays detect functional antibodies with the capacity to inhibit viral entry into cells. In the case of influenza, neutralising antibodies can be specific for the head of haemagglutinin or directed against a conserved region in the stem of haemagglutinin and are able to neutralise multiple subtypes of influenza. Specifically, a localised region of the haemagglutinin stem has been identified as an important antigenic site capable of inducing broadly neutralising antibodies.11, 12, 13 This region is highly conserved among group 1 influenza type A viruses (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, and H16).12 Although neutralising stem-specific haemagglutinin antibodies have been identified in man,11, 12, 14, 15 such stem antibody responses have not been elicited by vaccination. A vaccine regimen that could induce antibodies against a conserved antigenic target would represent an important step toward universal influenza vaccine development.",

Because of the background response due to previous infection with H1 and H3 viruses, we addressed this question with DNA vaccine encoding H5 as a priming vaccine (prime) followed by an H5N1 monovalent inactivated vaccine (MIV; boost) in phase 1 safety and immunogenicity studies.

The other three groups served as experimental groups designed to determine the value of DNA priming before MIV boosting and to assess the potential effect of boost interval or number of doses of DNA on the response. Group 1 received H5N1 MIV at day 0 and week 4. Group 2 received H5 DNA at day 0 followed by H5N1 MIV at week 4. Group 3 received H5 DNA at day 0 followed by H5N1 MIV at week 24. Group 4 received two doses of H5 DNA (one at day 0 and the other at week 4) followed by H5N1 MIV at week 24. Partly designed as a follow-up study, two groups in VRC 310 were enrolled to specifically validate the findings in VRC 306 and data from those two groups are presented here. VRC 310 group A received H5N1 MIV at day 0 and week 24 (a control group not included in VRC 306). Group B received H5 DNA at day 0 followed by an H5N1 MIV boost at 24 weeks, identical to group 3 in VRC 306. All DNA vaccinations were 4 mg and given via needle-free Biojector device (Bioject; Tualatin, OR, USA) and all H5N1 MIV vaccinations were 90 \u03bcg, administered by needle and syringe. The dosages of DNA vaccine and MIV vaccine were based on previous trials.17, 18, 19 All injections were given intramuscularly in the deltoid.",

We confirmed the specificity of these anti-sera using a competition ELISA assay in which haemagglutinin binding was done in the presence of 9E8 (anti-head) or F10 (anti-stem) antibodies. In this assay, binding to haemagglutinin was inhibited by the anti-stem antibody F10 but not the control anti-head antibody 9E8 (figure 3A). We assessed the ability of the sera from these individuals to neutralise heterologous strains of virus on an unmatched distant low pathogenicitiy H5N2 (A/mallard/Pennsylvania/12180/1984, 1984 Penn) and on a different subtype, H9N2 (A/Hong Kong/1074/1999, 1999 HK) in three representative individuals (figure 3B). Post-immune but not pre-immune sera neutralised the unrelated 1984 Penn virus and two of these individuals also neutralised the alternative subtype 1999 HK virus (figure 3C), documenting the increased breadth of these immune sera. Furthermore, wild-type H5 (Indo) haemagglutinin but not \u0394Stem trimer protein blocked neutralisation against each strain (figure 3B, C; lower panels\n, wild-type vs \u0394Stem), again showing that anti-stem neutralising antibodies were induced by vaccination in these individuals (webappendix pp 7\u20138).PanelResearch in context\nSystematic review\nWe searched PubMed for \u201cH5N1 infections\u201d, \u201cDNA influenza vaccine\u201d, \u201cH5N1 vaccine\u201d, \u201canti-stem antibody\u201d, and \u201cuniversal influenza vaccine\u201d. Relevant articles are referenced in context throughout this article. Numerous DNA vaccines have been reported as safe and immunogenic. H5N1 vaccines are generally less immunogenic than seasonal influenza vaccines. DNA priming has not been previously shown to induce significant improvements in HAI responses to influenza vaccines in man.\nInterpretation\nWe determined the data presented here by assessing H5 DNA vaccine priming with H5N1 MIV boosting in healthy volunteers in two clinical trials. The first clinical trial revealed surprising HAI responses after MIV with just one DNA prime 24-weeks earlier. The second trial allowed for enrolment of an important control group, an MIV-MIV regimen with a 24-week interval. This confirmed that the DNA primed group had higher HAI titres after MIV at 24 weeks compared directly to MIV-MIV with a 24 week interval.HAI=haemagglutination inhibition assay.

Similar to other H5 antigens, this antigen generally induces low-titre and low-frequency HAI responses compared with seasonal influenza strain vaccine antigens. The DNA vaccine assessed in this study has previously been shown to induce an HAI titre of 1:40 or more in just 20% of individuals when given three times at a 4 mg dose without an inactivated vaccine boost.32 Similarly, when given twice, the MIV boost product assessed in this study was recently shown by another group33 to induce an HAI GMT of 27\u00b76, and, although a 6-month boost interval improved those responses slightly (GMT 58\u00b77), little or no cross-reactive antibody was induced.33\n",

MIV given twice induced a protective HAI titre in six of 15 individuals in group 1, and in four of nine in group A. This finding is remarkable because of the relatively weak immunogenicity of the H5 antigen and because only one dose of DNA priming was needed to greatly improve the antibody response. Moreover, the longer boost interval significantly improved the responses seen in the DNA primed groups, but did not significantly improve the responses in individuals who received two doses of MIV. This result indicates that the biology of the priming immunisation differs between DNA and a traditional inactivated vaccine. Another surprising finding was that two doses of DNA as a prime did not greatly improve the overall responses beyond those seen with a single-dose of DNA. The two-dose DNA prime did affect the ELISA and neutralising antibody response but had no significant effect on the HAI response, which is known to correlate with protection. Gene-based antigen delivery accesses different pathways of antigen presentation and might thereby facilitate T-cell help, increase the number and diversity of CD4 clones,34 and induce greater expansion of the relevant B-cell populations. DNA prime-inactivated vaccine boost has been shown to elicit higher haemagglutinin-specific T-cell responses compared with inactivated vaccine alone in animals, supporting the findings in this study.",

The induction of stem-specific neutralising antibodies correlates with an overall higher magnitude of antibody response elicited by gene-based priming. Our data and previous studies16 suggest that gene-based priming stimulates increased helper T-cell responses, perhaps by presentation in the absence of other viral components.

However, an increase in the magnitude of the antibody response, either HAI titre or activity of neutralising antibodies, induced by an influenza vaccine should translate to improved efficacy. The present findings suggest that DNA priming could substantially augment the responses otherwise seen with traditional H5 MIV vaccine approaches, and that gene-based regimens may also provide an opportunity to induce broader and potentially more potent neutralising antibodies, especially if a response can be induced against conserved influenza epitopes such as to the stem of haemagglutinin. A longer boost interval might provide an optimum immune response and allow for more flexibility in an immunisation schedule. Moreover, DNA priming might also prove to be a successful strategy in the effort to improve otherwise marginal immune responses to influenza vaccines, such as those seen in the very young or elderly.",
