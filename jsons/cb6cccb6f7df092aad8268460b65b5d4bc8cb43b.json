            "text": "A ccording to reports from China, about 20% of hospitalized patients (1, 2) and up to 70% of critically ill patients (2) with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) develop the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which markedly increases the risk of death (3) . The majority of patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 require intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (1) (2) (3) . Even though the overflow of patients due to the outbreak and the need for patients isolation limit the application of refined diagnostic procedures (4) , bedside characterization of ARDS pathophysiology is essential to inform the management of these critically ill patients (5) . Available data seem to indicate that ARDS due to COVID-19 might present heterogeneous characteristics. The lung morphology is characterized by coexisting signs of alveolar damage and interstitial injury: ground-glass opacity with or without consolidation and septal thickening are common findings on CT images (6) . Furthermore, progression of pulmonary injury is characterized by specific alterations of the pulmonary vasculature tree, with dynamic increase in the size of vessels (7, 8) .",

            "text": "Potential for lung recruitment might be a crucial physiologic measure in ARDS patients (18) for two main reasons. From a clinical perspective, previous studies showed that higher potential for lung recruitment is an independent predictor of mortality in ARDS (18) . From a physiologic point of view, application of higher PEEP levels in patients with larger potential for recruitment could enhance lung protection through decreased atelectrauma (19) . However, likewise many other pathophysiological features (e.g., hyper-vs hypo-inflammatory condition) (20) , previous observations suggested that potential for lung recruitment can be highly variable in ARDS, possibly identifying specific ARDS subphenotypes with higher versus lower recruitability (18) . Our population of COVID-19 patients with ARDS confirmed that physiologic variability and need for personalized treatment are hallmarks of ARDS (21) . Potential for lung recruitment in our population ranged from 0.16 (meaning that the baby lung size increased only by 16% with a PEEP change of 10 cm H 2 O) to 1.40 (with an increase of the baby lung of 140%). These data generate the hypothesis that histopathological characteristics of ARDS from COVID-19 may be extremely heterogeneous in terms of the most represented lesions (e.g., interstitial vs intra-alveolar edema, reduced aeration vs fibrosis). This variability may be a consequence of the viral load, of the individual inflammatory response, or a mix of both. Our data suggest that potential www.ccmjournal.org XXX 2020 \u2022 Volume XX \u2022 Number XXX for lung recruitment should be assessed in each patient with ARDS from COVID-19, for example, to guide personalized titration of PEEP. The R/I ratio can be computed at the bedside by EIT or by other simpler and less expensive methods (14, 15) . Alternatively, impairment of oxygenation measured at low PEEP could be used to predict recruitability.",

            "text": "regional overdistension and diversion of perfusion from ventilated areas. Of note, overdistension and recruitment coexist to an unpredictable extent in ARDS (22) . Presence of vasodilation of pulmonary vessels (7) and micro-thrombosis might have further complicated the dynamics of perfusion redistribution at higher PEEP. Compression of dilated vessels in affected lung regions might represent an alternative to recruitment for explaining the PEEP-induced improvement in oxygenation. Furthermore, higher PEEP could worsen the right heart function, decreasing the cardiac output and reducing shunt (23), further improving oxygenation. Thus, average effects of higher PEEP in this population could already suggest some predominance of detrimental (increased dead space, overdistension, poor right heart function) versus potentially beneficial (recruitment, improved homogeneity) physiologic effects. Derangements in gas exchange during ARDS are caused by regional mismatch between ventilation and perfusion. In this cohort of COVID-19 patients, ventilation/perfusion mismatch was elevated and mainly due to nonperfused but ventilated units (dead space fraction). These observations add to those from previous studies indicating that elevated d-dimers are an independent predictor of mortality (3) and that pulmonary vessels are enlarged (7) in COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Inflammatory diffuse micro-thrombosis leading to elevated d-dimers, higher pulmonary vascular resistance and larger dead space fraction might be the underlying mechanism of the observed alterations, thus representing a key pathophysiological trait of ARDS from COVID-19. Specific treatments limiting the detrimental effects of dead space ventilation and diffuse micro-thrombosis (e.g., 5% co 2 inhalation or pulmonary vascular vasodilation) (24) could be tested in these patients.",

Second, the time we left patients at each PEEP level was short, albeit similar to previous studies (13) and longer than the one used in the first study reporting the methodology to assess the R/I ratio (15) . Third, patients were studied at different time points along their clinical time course, and this likely corresponded to different phases of the inflammation process, further increasing heterogeneity. However, potential for lung recruitment was not correlated with days from intubation, likely indicating that intubation might not be an accurate estimate of the highest severity reached by this syndrome. Fourth, albeit EIT measures of change in lung volumes, recruitment and ventilation-perfusion mismatch have been validated (13, 16) , only half of the lung parenchyma lies within the imaging field (25) . Fifth, we did not perform echocardiography to precisely assess the right heart function and the cardiac output at the two PEEP levels, thus leaving to speculation part of the explanations for our findings.",
