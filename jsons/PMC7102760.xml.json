It is clinically effective against several viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus [1], several hemorrhagic fever viruses [2, 3, 4] and HCV when combined with pegylated interferon-\u03b1 [5]. Moreover, it is effective against a large panel of RNA and DNA virus infections in vitro (summarized in Table 1\n). Nevertheless, the mechanism(s) of action of ribavirin are still under scrutiny, appearing to differ depending on the virus in question and the cell line used for study.",

One of them is based on the inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) by ribavirin-5\u2032-monophosphate, which leads to the depletion of intracellular GTP pools. The second one proposed postulates that unphosphorylated RBV has immunomodulatory effects on antiviral cellular responses, enhancing the T-helper type 1 over type 2 responses, or upregulating the interferon-stimulated response element. In addition, three direct mechanisms have been proposed: first, by inhibition of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) through direct interaction with ribavirin-5\u2032-triphosphate; second, by interfering with RNA capping activity (although this has not been extensively studied or demonstrated in recent years); and third, by increasing viral mutation rates through the misincorporation of RBV into the genome, leading to population extinction [6]. Here, we will review recent studies on RBV effects on viral replication and propagation in vitro and in vivo, and the molecular basis of ribavirin resistance.",

In this regard, RBV enhances the pSTAT4 and IFN-\u03b3 response of natural killer cells to IFN-\u03b1 stimulation [20]. By assessing RBV physiological levels in mono-infected and HIV co-infected patients, one study correlated lower response rates of HIV-infected patients with lower RBV bioavailability [21]. Interestingly, this combined therapy was surprisingly effective against disseminated human papillomavirus infection in a patient having previously undergone treatment for psoriasis [22], in HIV-HCV co-infected patients [23], as well as in a patient with acquired aplastic anemia [24].",

            "text": "In HCV infected patients undergoing RBV monotherapy, only a moderate and transient antiviral effect is observed. A lack of clear and direct inhibitory/mutagenic effects of RBV on HCV in vivo is thought to be a question of physiological concentrations of the drug or an issue of sampling the wrong compartment (blood versus liver). However, in recent studies, RBV was found to induce significantly more G-to-A and C-to-U transitions, a genetic signature that is indicative of ribavirin-induced mutagenesis [25\u2022\u2022, 26]. Whether the effect is sufficiently strong to be of benefit is not yet determined. For other clinical infections, RBV monotherapy remains the treatment of choice. For example, in transplant patients treated for hepatitis E infection, RBV therapy ensures a sustained virologic response in most patients as a first-line, or as a second and prolonged, therapy [27]. It is also a well-tolerated option to treat respiratory syncytial virus infections in immunocompromised patients [28]. As the only antiviral treatment against Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, it appears to be beneficial when administrated early, with decreased severity and fatality rates [29]. In a preliminary study, combination treatment was also shown to be effective against rhinovirus (RV) in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, who are more susceptible to RV infections [30]. To explore an intervention strategy for the recently identified \u03b2 coronavirus isolate hCoV-EMC/2012, treatment of rhesus macaques with RBV alone reduced virus replication. In combination with interferon-\u03b12b, treatment was even more effective and permitted lower doses that are in line with clinical use [31]. Finally, RBV was shown to have protective potential against lethal hantavirus pulmonary syndrome after intranasal exposure of hamsters to Andes Virus, where the presence of live virus was reduced or abolished in serum [32].",

            "text": "A number of RBV resistant variants have been either generated or isolated within the Picornaviridae family, all mapping to the RdRp and for many of them, resistance was accompanied by increased fidelity (Table 2\n). The first ribavirin-resistant poliovirus variant contained G64S in the RdRp [33], which led to the generation of four other RBV-resistant variants at this amino acid position (G64A, L,V and T) [34]. These variants resist the effects of several mutagens through increased replication fidelity. Mutations similar to those in poliovirus, G64R and G64T, were generated in human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) that confer resistance to RBV and increased fidelity [35]. Recently, a FMDV mutagen-resistant RdRp variant was isolated using another mutagenic compound, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). This R84H variant is also resistant to RBV and to a third mutagen, 5-azacytidine (AZC), as would be expected of high fidelity viruses [36]. A naturally occurring RdRp variant A372V of Coxsackie virus B3 is also resistant to these three mutagens through increased fidelity [37]. Yet another high fidelity HEV71 RdRp variant, L123F, was selected under RBV passage [38]. Within the Togaviridae family, the polymerase mutant C483Y of chikungunya virus was isolated using mutagenic passaging in RBV and 5-FU [39], which demonstrates higher replication fidelity. For HCV, ribavirin resistant mutations in the NS5A protein were first described using a replicon system [40]. More recently, resistant populations were isolated by serially passaging J6/JFH1 virus in RBV, which present dozens of mutations throughout the genome that could be responsible, including in the RdRp, but the precise determinant is not known [41]. In a later study, they confirmed that this population is also resistant to 5-FU, supporting increased fidelity as the mechanism behind its resistance [42].",

The authors suggest that this residue is involved in nucleotide recognition, but whether resistance results from increased fidelity or from increased processivity remains to be determined. Recently, another ribavirin-resistant FMDV polymerase variant A38V and a mutant carrying four RdRp amino acid substitutions called DAMM were isolated, but do not tolerate 5-FU or AZC treatment [43]. These variants have RBV-specific resistance profiles, similar to the first RBV-resistant FMDV polymerase variant M296I [44, 45], suggesting that increased fidelity is not the basis of their resistance.",

A dozen variants in different residue positions of Coxsackie virus B3 polymerase, and several variants of the same RdRp residue of chikungunya and Sindbis virus, are more sensitive to base analog mutagens because of their reduced polymerase fidelity, further confirming the mutagenic affect of RBV on RNA viruses [37, 46\u2022, 47]. In the case of coronaviruses (CoV) a hyper-sensitive ExoN-mutant has generated interesting data in recent years. Given that coronaviruses have the largest RNA genomes, they would expectedly be hyper-sensitive to RNA mutagens such as RBV; however, this did not seem to be the case. Following the discovery of a potential 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN) proofreading activity of the nsp14 [48], it was hypothesized that deletion of this activity would result in RBV sensitivity. This hypothesis was validated using murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV ExoN-mutants, treated with RBV or 5-FU [49\u2022].",

It appears that in many cases, this pleiotropic compound is simply being true to its pleiotropic nature. A significant recent advance, and complication, toward this goal is the variability observed between cell types and tissues in RBV uptake and metabolism, that could impact the efficacy of a drug being administered with one mechanism in mind, while another mechanism is ultimately at work. Future research requires a better validation of these mechanisms depending on the cell system used, especially in the case of HCV. The most important goal is to determine how ribavirin treatment affects the virus in vivo, to more properly tailor treatments and identify alternative compounds with similar effects. Currently, the use of animal models to bridge laboratory and clinical studies are relatively scarce.",
