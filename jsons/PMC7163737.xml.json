When exploring hypoxia, one has to compare hypoxic to normoxic conditioning. However, most published studies consider AtO2 as normoxia 1. This could lead to misinterpretation, as, for example, physiological oxygen fraction (physioxia) found in secondary lymphoid organs is close to 5% O2 and can induce differential T lymphocyte activation as compared to AtO2 in vitro 18, 19, 20. This highlights the necessity to not only use physioxia as a reference point to study hypoxia impact in vitro, but also to analyze cell physiology in general. Physioxia in tissues varies greatly: e.g. skin 1.1%, brain 4.4%, pulmonary alveoli 14.5% (Supporting Information Fig. 1A) 3. As a baseline for physioxia in healthy tissues, 5% O2 was previously used for assessing lymphocyte function 19; we also selected this compromise value for our study.",

            "text": "The impact of hypoxia and HIF has been intensively studied in the context of malignancy or infection and often positively correlated with pathogenesis. In cancer, hypoxia promotes tumor cell stemness, migration, invasiveness, metastasis, and resistance to radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and to CTL\u2010mediated killing [10, 21\u201325]. In viral infection, hypoxia increases viral replication and gene expression 26. To date, the impact of hypoxia on T cells implicated in anti\u2010tumor and anti\u2010viral immunity is not extensively described. Most studies focused on CD4+ T cells, without consensus regarding the effects. Earlier studies suggested a positive correlation between hypoxia and viability or proliferation 27, 28, more recent studies showed the opposite 29, 30. Hypoxia was also shown to increase Th17 and Treg polarization 31, 32. Concerning cytokine production, there are conflicting results for secretion of IL\u20102, IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u201010, and IL\u20101\u03b2 29, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. Overall, despite certain contradictions in this emerging research area, the knowledge base for CD4+ T cells is becoming more comprehensive. The impact of hypoxia and oxygen tensions on CD8+ T cells is restricted to a few interesting studies 17, 18, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42. However, there are many issues regarding the reactivation of already primed CD8+ T cells (hereafter considered as CTLs) that require further investigation. It is particularly important to understand CTL responses to hypoxia because, in contrast to certain Th subsets, these cells must function in the most oxygen\u2010deprived sites in the body (e.g. tumor bed, sites of infection).",

Our investigations of immune function under oxygen deprivation revealed that whereas hypoxia did not modify CTL killing capacities, it potently induced IL\u201010 secretion upon reactivation, and dramatically decreased CTL expansion.",

Relative to 21% O2, the physioxic oxygen fraction (5% O2) that was used during CTL generation upregulated RNA expression of different genes described to be increased by hypoxia. These included hif1a exon I.1 (albeit weakly expressed, as judged by Nanostring absolute RNA counts (data not shown)), hif2a, vegfa, glut1, entpd1 (CD39), galectin3, gelsolin, and tnfrsf9 (CD137). However, hif1a, adora2a (A2AR), and hif1b were not modulated, hif3a was not expressed, while nt5e (CD73) was downregulated 11, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 (Fig. 1A). Several genes positively associated with CD8+ T cell survival and expansion were upregulated, including gata3, il2ra, and cd28 [51\u201353]. However, maf and ctla4, associated with increased apoptosis and immune regulation 54, 55, were also upregulated. It was noteworthy that CTLs generated under physioxia showed a higher effector profile, evidenced by blimp1 and fasl upregulation, and tcf7 downregulation (Fig. 1B). Consistent with these observations, CTLs generated under normoxia showed increase of the CD44+ CD62L\u2010 fraction (Fig. 1C) and a decrease of CD127 (IL\u20107R\u03b1) expression (Supporting Information Figs. 1C and 2A). This was not due to the CD8+ T\u2010cell clone used, as OT\u2010I CTLs and polyclonal CTLs from C57BL/6 gave the same results (Supporting Information Fig. 2B\u2013D). Accordingly, CTLs generated under physioxia had increased killing capacities as compared to CTLs generated under AtO2 (Supporting Information Fig. 2E). We next investigated whether hypoxia (1% O2) could impact CTL lytic capacities. Independently of the oxygen fraction used during CTL generation, hypoxia during the cytotoxicity assay had no effect (Supporting Information Fig. 2E). As this assay implies a short\u2010term hypoxia exposure (4 h), we also preconditioned the CTLs three days before carrying out the killing assay. Interestingly, CTLs generated under AtO2 and that were preconditioned under hypoxia showed increased cytotoxicity (Fig. 1D). However, CTLs generated under physioxia and that were preconditioned under hypoxia did not augment their killing capacities. GranzymeB (GrB) was preferentially expressed by CTLs that were generated under physioxia as compared to those generated under AtO2 (Supporting Information Fig. 2F\u2013G), consistent with the increase in effector versus memory differentiation that we observed. However, we did not observe any difference when CTLs were preconditioned or not under hypoxia. Therefore, hypoxia might improve CTL killing capacities of CTLs generated under AtO2 through a mechanism independent of GrB production.",

The impact of hypoxia on CD8+ T\u2010cell antitumor or antiviral responses is most critical to examine during CTL reactivation, such as occurs when already primed cells have migrated to nonlymphoid tissues to exert their effector functions in a potentially hypoxic microenvironment. To model this, CTLs generated under physioxia were reactivated either under physioxia (5% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2). We also compared these results to CTLs generated and reactivated under AtO2 (Supporting Information Fig. 1B). As expected, one day postrestimulation HIF\u20101\u03b1 stabilization was regulated negatively by oxygen fraction (Supporting Information Fig. 3). However, two days postrestimulation its level decreased under low oxygen fraction while it was highly stabilized under AtO2; thus confirming previous results showing that HIFs are involved in TCR signaling. As found for priming of CD8+ T cells (data not shown), hypoxia dramatically decreased CTL expansion after reactivation (Fig. 2A). This was associated with reduced cell divisions and viability (Fig. 2B, C), with a trend toward more apoptosis (Fig. 2D). Similar expansion was obtained using OT\u2010I CD8+ T cells and also with polyclonal CTLs from C57BL/6 mice (Supporting Information Fig. 4A\u2013D).",

However, as compared to physioxia, hypoxia impacted one fifth of them (5/42), and to a lesser extent (Fig. 2F). CTLs reactivated for two days under hypoxia showed increased expression of il10 and tnfrsf9 (CD137), and to a lesser extent bcl2, hif2a, and il2ra (CD25). Of all genes analyzed, il10 was the most modulated under hypoxia, independently of the oxygen fraction used as normoxia reference. RNA expression kinetics for il10, ifng, tnfrsf9 (CD137), il2ra (CD25), and hif2a (Supporting Information Fig. 5A\u2013E) indicated a strong upregulation of RNA levels by two days postreactivation, then a decrease, although hif2a RNA expression was more stable. For all these genes there was a negative correlation between oxygen fractions and RNA expression. Concerning bcl2 RNA (Supporting Information Fig. 5F), its expression was decreased from two days postreactivation, but it was more stable under hypoxia. In order to know whether these modulations were due to hypoxia itself or to a combination of hypoxia plus TCR stimulation, we analyzed expression of the same panel of genes by CTLs cultured for two days without stimulation (Supporting Information Fig. 6A\u2013D).There was no upregulation of il10, hif2a, or il2ra, showing that hypoxia\u2010driven upregulation of these molecules is dependent on TCR stimulation.

Lowering oxygen tension increased the fraction of IL\u201010 producing CTLs (Fig. 3C, D), the IL\u201010\u2010positive fraction also coexpressed IFN\u2010\u03b3. However, whereas hypoxia augmented the IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010positive fraction as compared to AtO2, it did not significantly increase this fraction as compared to physioxia (Fig. 3D). Analysis of secreted IL\u201010 indicated weak secretion under AtO2, moderate induction by physioxia, and potent induction by hypoxia (Fig. 3E). Using CD8+ T cells from OT\u2010I and C57BL/6 mice yielded the same results (Supporting Information Fig. 7E and G). Thus, these data suggest that IL\u201010 is a typical CTL cytokine following reactivation under physioxia, and that its secretion is further increased under hypoxia. However, IL\u201010 is not a cytokine secreted after primary activation of na\u00efve CD8+ T cells, even when primed under physioxia or hypoxia (data not shown). We next tested whether IL\u201010 secretion was responsible for the decreased cell expansion under hypoxia; using an IL\u201010\u2010blocking antibody during CTL reactivation did not restore expansion under hypoxia (Fig. 3F). Thus, hypoxia impacts on the cytokine secretion profile of CTLs, but at least for IL\u201010, without autocrine consequences. We did not observe any hypoxia\u2010related increase in expression of IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u20102, or TNF\u2010\u03b1 (Fig. 3G\u2013I, Supporting Information Fig. 7F and H).

To show that CD8+ tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) indeed express CD25, CD137, and IL\u201010 in vivo, we purified CD8+ TILs and compared them to CD8+ T cells from spleen. Whereas in the spleen, CD25 and CD137 were not expressed, \u223c13% of CD8+ TILs were CD25+ and \u223c30% were CD137+ (Fig. 4A), with most CD25+ cells coexpressing CD137. As IL\u201010 protein cannot be observed easily without in vitro cell manipulation, we looked at il10 RNA. Expression was higher in CD8+ TILs as compared to CD8+ splenocytes (Fig. 4B); moreover, hif2a was also overexpressed. As indicated by scatter graphs showing correlation between CD8+ purity and il10 mRNA (Supporting Information Fig. 8C), il10 mRNA expression was not from contaminating non\u2010T cells such as tumor cells or macrophages. In order to confirm that oxygen fraction is a major regulator of CD8+ TIL expansion, and of CD25, CD137, and IL\u201010 expression, we reactivated CD8+ TILs ex vivo with anti\u2010CD3/anti\u2010CD28\u2010coated beads under varying oxygen fractions (i.e. 21, 5, and 1%). As we previously described using in vitro generated CTLs, expansion, and viability correlated positively with oxygen levels (Fig. 4C). Finally, confirming our in vitro data, we observed that CD25, CD137 (Fig. 4D), and most importantly IL\u201010, were negatively correlated with oxygen levels (Fig. 4E). Importantly, upregulation of these molecules under hypoxia needed a combination of TCR\u2010ligation plus hypoxia (Fig. 4D, E). In addition, IFN\u2010\u03b3 secretion was slightly decreased under hypoxia (Fig. 4F).",

Furthermore, Blimp1, a transcription factor associated with effector differentiation 57 was upregulated, while Tcf7, a transcription factor associated with differentiation and persistence of memory CD8+ T cells 58 was downregulated. Consistent with the effector versus memory profiling, CTLs generated under physioxia were more lytic than those generated at 21% O2, suggesting that CTL generation under AtO2 (e.g. for adoptive therapy) could be suboptimal. This is consistent with previous reported increased granzyme A expression and cytotoxicity of T cells preactivated under physiologic oxygen tensions 18, 59. This might also be linked to increased HIF activity under physioxia, as HIFs were described to increase CTL effector function 17, 41. Our results show that physioxia (as found in secondary lymphoid organs) facilitates efficacious CD8+ T\u2010cell expansion and differentiation, and that in vitro analyses under AtO2 poorly mimic these in vivo conditions. Of particular interest, eight important genes described to be hypoxia\u2010regulated, including the widely reported Vegfa and Glut1 genes, were regulated even under the physiologic oxygen value that we chose as physioxia (i.e. 5%), as compared to AtO2. The impact of oxygen tensions is relevant to understand T\u2010cell priming under physioxia 18, 19, even if na\u00efve T cells only rarely enter hypoxic sites as in the tumor bed 60, 61. Na\u00efve and effector T cells will be expected to differ in their sensitivity to activation stimuli since they are phenotypically distinct, and possess unique metabolic patterns (e.g. glucose and cysteine requirements) 17, 62.",

However, the critical issues of their survival, expansion, and function under such in vivo relevant conditions were seldom addressed 17, 41. In agreement with previous studies 38, 40, we observed that hypoxia did not modify CTL killing capacities in a short\u2010term assay, regardless of the oxygen tension used for CTL generation. Nevertheless, we noticed that preconditioning for three days under hypoxia of CTLs generated under AtO2 increased their lytic capacities. Importantly, we showed that CTL expansion following reactivation was strongly decreased under hypoxia, with both decreased viability and proliferation. We hypothesized that the underlying defect may be linked to disturbed IL\u20102R signaling, as recently shown in CD4+ T cells 30, but addition of exogenous IL\u20102 to CD8+ TILs did not restore proliferation under hypoxia (Supporting Information Fig. 8D), despite elevated expression of CD25. Another explanation could be hypoxia\u2010induced immune regulation through adenosine\u2010A2AR signaling 46, 63. However, our results (with reactivated CD8+ T cells) are more in line with a recent publication showing a hypoxia\u2010induced A2AR\u2010independent decrease of cell expansion 42, since we observed neither CD25, nor Fasl downregulation that characterizes adenosinergic\u2010induced immunosuppression 63, 64. However, in an in vivo microenvironment where adenosine levels have been shown to be high, hypoxia\u2010induced adenosinergic\u2013dependent and independent inhibition of T\u2010cell expansion might occur concomitantly.",

However, as compared to physioxia, hypoxia was much less potent, modulating expression of only five of the 42 genes. Nevertheless, all of these genes overlapped with those identified as being modulated following switching cells from atmospheric to hypoxic conditions. Among these, two of the upregulated genes that we confirmed to be overexpressed at the protein level, tnfsrf9 (CD137) and il2ra (CD25), were previously reported to be hypoxia\u2010regulated 18, 30, 44. Of particular interest, from the whole panel of genes analyzed, il10 was the most highly modulated gene by CTLs under hypoxia.

However, despite this (but consistent with RNA expression) CTLs and CD8+ TILs secreted increased amounts of the IL\u201010 immunomodulatory cytokine after restimulation under both physioxia and hypoxia, with hypoxia being the most potent inducer. This was only observed for effector CD8+ T cells, as the priming of na\u00efve CD8+ T cells under hypoxia did not lead to IL\u201010 secretion (data not shown). Since we observed negligible secretion of IL\u201010 by CTLs reactivated under AtO2, our results suggest that this capacity of CTLs is underestimated by conventional in vitro methodology, but will likely occur in vivo in many tissues, as we observed for il10\u2010expressing CD8+ TILs. In the limited number of reports concerning IL\u201010 production by CD8+ T cells that we are aware of, most have been in the context of infection: coronavirus\u2010induced acute encephalitis, chronic mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and respiratory viral infection 65, 66, 67, 68. CTL\u2010produced IL\u201010 has been suggested as a feedback mechanism to dampen immunopathology caused by excessive cytolytic and inflammatory activity 69. Our results support such a function, since hypoxia is a feature of infected tissues 7. However, although IL\u201010 is mainly known for its immunosuppressive activity, some studies have shown immunostimulatory effects 70. We did not observe any stimulatory or inhibitory effects of IL\u201010 on CTL\u2010expansion under hypoxia, but in a complex in vivo microenvironment, it could act in a paracrine manner on other immune cells, or on tumor cells. In malignancy, the role of IL\u201010 is still a matter of debate, with promotion of tumor immune surveillance being reported 71, but also correlation with poor prognosis, increased cancer recurrence, and metastasis 72. It will be critical to determine in future studies whether IL\u201010 produced by tumor\u2010specific CTLs can impact on their therapeutic efficacy.",

The use of monoclonal CD8+ T cells with identical sensitivity to ligands precluded the potential drawback of selection of certain clones within polyclonal T cells because of increased fitness or affinity at a given oxygen tension. Nevertheless, our major findings were similar in polyclonal C57BL/6\u2010derived CD8+ CTLs and CD8+ TILs. Our data challenges the use of AtO2 as normoxia in order to determine the in vivo impact of hypoxia in vitro. Overall, we show that even if hypoxia does not disturb lytic capacities of CTLs, it could diminish antitumor or antiviral responses in vivo through a negative impact on CD8+ T cell fate and the induction of IL\u201010 secretion that could act in a paracrine manner on other immune cell types or tissues. If IL\u201010 released by CTLs is dampening inflammatory responses in hypoxic tissues in vivo, this may be a valuable feedback mechanism to limit immunopathology in infection, but it is likely to blunt tumor immunosurveillance or immunotherapy.",

Probes for the analysis of 47 different genes (Nanostring technologies) included five normalization genes (Supporting Information Table 1). Background correction was done by subtracting from the raw counts the mean +2 SD of counts obtained with negative controls. Values <1 were fixed to 1. Positive controls were used as quality assessment: we checked that the ratio between the highest and the lowest positive controls average among the samples was below 3. Then, counts for target genes were normalized with the geometric mean of the three reference genes (actb, tbp, eef1a1) selected as the most stable using the geNorm algorithm 74. Counts for each RNA species were analyzed using an in house Excel macro, and then expressed as counts (molecules of RNA/sample) 75.",
