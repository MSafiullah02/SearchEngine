Public health interventions have had significant impacts in reducing transmission and in averting even more deaths. Nonetheless, in many jurisdictions (both at national and local levels) the decline of cases and fatalities after apparent epidemic peaks has not been rapid. Instead, the asymmetric decline in cases appears, in some cases, to be consistent with plateau-or shoulder-like phenomena. Here we explore a model of fatality-driven awareness in which individual protective measures increase with death rates. In this model, epidemic dynamics can be characterized by plateaus, shoulders, and lag-driven oscillations after exponential rises at the outset of disease dynamics. We also show that incorporating long-term awareness can avoid peak resurgence and accelerate epidemic decline. We suggest that awareness of the severity of the short-and long-term epidemic is likely to play a critical role in disease dynamics, beyond that imposed by intervention-driven policies.",

In the United States, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model has emerged as a key influencer of state-and national-level policy [1] . The IHME model includes a detailed characterization of the variation in hospital bed capacity, ICU beds, and ventilators between and within states. Predicting the projected strains on underlying health resources is critical to supporting planning efforts. However such projections require an epidemic 'forecast'. The IHME's epidemic forecast differs from conventional epidemic models in a significant way -IHME assumes that the cumulative deaths in the COVID-19 epidemic follow a symmetric, Gaussian-like trajectory. For example, the IHME model predicts that if the peak is 2 weeks away then in 4 weeks cases will return to the level of the present, and continue to diminish rapidly. But, epidemics need not have one symmetric peak -the archaic Farr's Law of Epidemics notwithstanding (see [2] for a cautionary tale of using Farr's law as applied to the HIV epidemic).",

Subsequent spread, if left unchecked, would yield a single peak -in theory. That peak corresponds to when 'herd immunity' is reached, such that the effective reproduction number, R eff = 1. The effective reproduction number denotes the number of new infectious cases caused by a single infectious individual in a population with pre-existing circulation. But, even when herd immunity is reached, there will still be new cases which then diminish over time, until the epidemic concludes. A single-peak paradigm is only robust insofar as the disease has spread sufficiently in a population to reach and exceed 'herd immunity'. The converse is also true in the case of COVID-19 -as long as a population remains predominantly immunologically naive, then the risk of further infection has not passed.",

The ICL model is an example of a 'conventional' epidemic model that shows the benefits of early intervention steps in reducing transmission and preserving health system resources vs. a 'herd immunity' strategy. The ICL model assumes that transmission is reduced because of externalities, like lockdowns, school closings, and so on. As a result, the ICL model suggests that lifting of large-scale public health interventions could be followed by a second wave of cases. Yet, for a disease that is already the documented cause of more than 50,000 deaths in the United States, we posit that individuals are likely to continue to modify their behavior even after lockdowns are lifted.

The earlier analysis of the quasi-stationary equilibrium in fatalities holds; hence we anticipate that dynamics should converge to \u03b4 = \u03b4 (q) at early times. However, increased delays between cases and fatalities could lead to oscillations in both. Indeed, this is what we find via examination of models in which T H ranges from 7 to 35 days, with increasing magnitude of oscillations as T H increases (see Figure 3 for k = 2 with qualitatively similar results for k = 1 and k = 4 on the github).",

This decline arises because D monotonically increases; increasing fatalities beyond D c leads to rapid suppression of transmission. However, when \u03b4 c rather than D c drives dynamics, then shoulders and plateaus can re-emerge. In reality, we expect that individual behavior is shaped by short-and long-term awareness of risks, including the potential for 'decay' of long-term awareness [11, 12] .",

In these conditions, if individuals are unable to sustain social distancing policies, or begin to tolerate higher death rates, then cases could increase. Hence: passing a 'peak' need not imply the rapid decline of risk. These types of impacts of awareness-driven endogenous changes in R eff are typically absent in models that form the basis for public policy and strategic planning. Moving forward, we hope that our findings highlight the impacts of short-term and long-term awareness in efforts to shape information campaigns to reduce transmission after early onset 'peaks', particularly when populations remain predominantly immunologically naive.
