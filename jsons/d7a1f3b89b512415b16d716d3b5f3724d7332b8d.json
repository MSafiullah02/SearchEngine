In the countries with most accessible mental health healthcare system such as Australia and the Scandinavian, the mortality gaps accounted to 15-20 years compared to the normal population (Thornicroft, 2013) .

The government and other responsible stakeholders should take a lead to screen the health condition of these homeless mentally ill persons in the LMICs, which may be beneficial in reducing the community spread of COVID-19 infection. At the same time there is potential role of mental health professionals to address the mental health issues of these patients as they are often untreated (Banerjee, 2020) . As there is paucity of manpower in mental healthcare in developing countries, the mental health issues of homeless mentally ill can be addressed through online consultation liaising with general medical practitioners (Yao et al., 2020) . Early and adequate treatment of mental illnesses in these patients is likely to improve their general physical health and degree of adherence to the precautionary measures required during this COVID-19 pandemic.",
