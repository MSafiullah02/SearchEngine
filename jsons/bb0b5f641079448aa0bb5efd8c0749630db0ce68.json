This inequality is one of the core elements of failure in the eradication of hunger and poverty. Therefore, many multilateral organizations, such as the World Bank (WB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and regional associations like the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the East African Development Bank (EADB), have recommended to the governments to reduce the internal gap and to dedicate more resources for human development. They should address basic food production systems with job creation, increase low salaries and subsidies for the marginalized and promote cheap prices of basic food for the urban poor.",

'Freedom from want' requires sufficient food ('food security') and water ('water security'), and both are key demands of any human security concept as a necessity for survival, and thus it has become a basic human right. Human security requires not only a quality of life and a decent livelihood, but also health and stable productive conditions for almost half of the world population living in marginal rural and urban areas (see part IX and chap. 74 to 96).",

Thus, in this author's understanding 'food sovereignty' goes beyond the physical conditions of production and market, and involves social (Campos 1995; Strahm/Oswald 1990), cultural (Arizpe 2004), economic (Calva 2008/a; Mart\u00ednez 2003; Cadena 1 This article has been substantially improved as a result of an international cooperation.

He also compiled box 33.1 and systematized important parts of box 33.3. I am immensely grateful for his careful editing and style correction and to Ronnie Lappin for his language editing. 2 Regressive globalization is understood in this context as a doctrine, rooted in the confidence of the efficacy, institutional building and moral authority of US power, allied with transnational capital in the sphere of communication, military, commerce, finance, and productive system. Using the term democracy and progress it is promoting a liberal global world order, favouring international capital and transnational productive systems. In the poor countries this process creates greater poverty, technological dependency, debts, massive rural migration and often loss of food sovereignty, while a small elite benefits from this alliance.",

The author will not use the term 'food security' developed during the past four decades (see part 34.2, where the debate in the FAO and World Bank has been briefly documented and criticized as a too technological and top-down approach), but will developed a wider concept of 'food sovereignty'. 4 The author has developed in chap. 90 her proposal for a new and wider policy-relevant security concept that combines human, gender and environmental security (HUGE) dangers and concerns. On this dual political and conceptual background, this chapter addresses the following research problem: food represents not only a security issue of intake of nutrients, but it forms part of a holistic understanding of life and a constituting element of any civilization. Thus it includes networks of connectedness (vertical: patron-client, and horizontal: social groups), belonging, relationship of trust, reciprocity, cooperation and exchange. It creates social benefits and risk reduction, but also innovative activities through a wider access to information and learning. It is a process of anchoring of personal and group identity (see chap. 90 by Oswald on HUGE), where social relations reaffirm the integration of a person inside a community with clear rights and obligations, such as access to land, credit, technology, training, market, life quality and rituals. Besides guaranteeing the physical and cultural survival, food also creates new opportunities for people-centred poverty alleviation and new understanding of 'rurality'. It represents a critical response to the past development and modernization paradigms and opens ways for diverse rural life processes, where agricultural activities and environmental services coexist with services, technology, and industries.",

Then it scrutinizes the contradiction that in a world with increasing production and a diverse offer of food, hunger is still one of the most important causes of illness and death, because an important part of food is used for livestock and for industrial purposes. Recently, biofuels have aggravated the scarcity of food worldwide and regionally, affecting above all vulnerable groups such as poor peasants and marginalized urban people in the South and North. This part reviews the internal food intake not only globally, but also for Latin America and in a case study of Mexico that focuses on the remote indigenous regions of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Guerrero where undernourishment is still high and one of the causes of child mortality (33. 3) .",

It uses traditional agricultural methods developed in each region; recycles organic waste, produces soil enrichment with compost and uses biopesticides and natural seeds. The transformation of food uses long-established techniques and avoids the use of chemicals for conservation. This production system not only conserves the natural nutritional values of food and soils, but it is also an alternative for the self-sufficiency of poor peasants worldwide (33.4).",

Sometimes, nutrition gaps are also measured by the minimal daily nutritional requirements in relation to age, sex, and activities. Thus, food security is assuring the physical availability and the economic accessibility to enough food in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner, where adequate quantity and quality, but also culturally acceptable food for everybody at any time is able to guarantee a healthy and active life. Quantity refers to amount, distribution, calories and proteins, and quality to safe, innocuous, nutritious balanced, good and culturally accepted food. Among the many 6 Anabolism is the process which builds up complex molecules from smaller units, able to give the body the required energy that is coming from glucose and fatty acids. Therefore, it refers to chemical reactions that produce a combination of different molecules. The result of anabolism is the creation of new cellular material (enzymes, proteins, cells and its membrane, organs and tissues). Thus, anabolism is crucial for growth, maintainance, and reparation of tissue. 7 An optimal functioning of an organism or of its cells requires about a hundred different substances located in the environment. Their function is to maintain the structure and to control the metabolism. Metabolism means the sum of chemical changes taking place inside an organism by which food is transformed and utilized by the organisms, and water products are eliminated.

The implementation of these theories by governments in Latin America is reflected in three lost decades of development, while the policies have failed to eradicate poverty and to overcome hunger. In many cases these neoliberal concepts have worsened the situation of the rural and urban poor who still experience undernourishment with all the negative human, social, economic, and cultural effects. Due to the low income of the marginalized poor as a result of underdevelopment, economic crises, the increase of productive costs and chemical inputs, the rise of prices for basic products when crop prices collapsed, erosion of soils and scarcity as well as pollution of water, the peasants started in Latin America in the 1950's to migrate massively to big towns. In marginal slums, they have lived with survival strategies (box 33.4) that are defined by Diego Palma as \"a sum of initiatives able to complement the salary in terms of the reproduction of their labour force\" (Palma 1986: 28). Nevertheless, the origin of the concept started with Duque and Pastrana (1973) when they described the situation of rural migrants invading urban marginal land in Chile, and started to create their new livelihood. Susana Torado included in the concept \"the procreation of family life cycle and labour migrations\" and named them \"strategies of family life\" (nd: 2), a term that was amplified by the group of Quito as \"strategies of existence\" (PISPAL 1978).",

The affected nations were obliged though draconic policies to pay back at any cost their debts, and as a consequence public support and subsidies were drastically reduced. The adjustment costs of this failed policy were transferred to the workers and peasants, and later to the middle classes, which resulted in massive unemployment, loss of purchase power, increasing prices of the basic food basket, the elimination of controlled prices in basic products, a growing monopoly in the trade system, and a reduced purchase power parity (PPP) ( members, neighbours, and from the corner shop. Soon, these possibilities disappeared due to the persistence of economic crisis, and food became scarce. Then, e.g. in Mexico City (Oswald 1991), women organized themselves, picking up half-perished products from the garbage of the central market and transformed these products into food in collective popular kitchens Collective community work (kitchen, child rearing, pressure on public functionaries) was organized through a system of rotation. United, they fought for basic services (electricity, water, roads, security, health and community centres; Rosiques 2003) and the legalization of land and services. Due to lacking cash and jobs, they struggled also for public subsidies and poverty alleviation programmes (Ram\u00edrez 1991). Besides all these activities, women still found time for some temporary paid work as domestics, washing or ironing; others generated services, handicrafts, food selling, etc. to be able to maintain their families. Children, grandparents, and sometimes husbands supported these complex strategies, where poverty of time was the highest cost paid by women (Damian  2002) .",

Politically, this system relied on high government subsidies (USA, EU, OCDE, Japan), offering the consumers cheap products. The production was controlled by agronomists, veterinarians, and the chemical industry. Health and environment concerns were marginal. The Ministry of Agriculture managed natural resources such as soils, water, forests, flora, fauna, and fish. Internationally, this model should have eradicated hunger and given the whole world food security. Until today it remains the basic tool against hunger (FAO  1996a, 2000a, , 2005b, 2005c) . High crop yields and 'free markets' were at the centre of the concern and therefore hunger could not be eradicated, owing to the maximization of profit of agribusiness and governmental subsidies in developed countries. Hunger and poverty were considered undesirable side effects for southern countries and for people with a low capacity to modernize. Social, environmental, and cultural factors of diverse food production are only marginally considered. Food is not treated as a cultural good or as a patrimony of thousands of years of human effort. The limits of this model are imposed by negative effects on health (Gallaher 2005) and on the environment (scarcity in water and oil resources).",

Concrete genes were linked to specific illnesses (Nestl\u00e9 1999), creating a scientific basis for life or a 'life science' paradigm (Lang/Heaseman 2004). This model is demand-oriented and takes into account the consumers and their needs. Productivity is still important. It refers to the balanced daily intake of proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals, all of them necesary for a healthy life. This life science model integrates the food chain in the form of clusters and relates it to production, transformation, and trade of food. It combines genetic research with field experiments, including biology, engineering, nutrition, pharmacology, health, and mobile field labs. The industries are controlled by multinational food chains. They offer clean, safe, and homogenous products that can stay for weeks on the shelves of supermarkets, thanks to genetically modified genes and organisms (GMO). Food is not only modified but also enriched artificially with nutrients to prevent illness, such as enzymes, proteins, minerals, etc. At the centre of concerns is the individual health, improved by technological proceedings in bio-labs, where specialists are in charge of human lives (Nestle 2002). These processes of 'healthy' food can only be controlled through sophisticated scientific procedures in well-equipped laboratories in universities or research institutes of MNE. The experts are paid by the food MNE, which are simultaneously producers, sellers, and supervisors. When nonconformities arise, due to the complexity of the process, governments rely on these institutions, where those who are interested and involved are both judge and arbiter (Beck 1998; 2000) .",

South Africa, Chile, India, and Brazil are joining this production process. On GMO seeds there exists an oligopoly of four main multinational enterprises. One sole holding (Monsanto) controls 90 per cent of all seeds with two genetic modified proprieties: a herbicide (roundup) and an insecticide (Bt). Conclusive results are still lacking whether these seeds are innocuous, but there are risks that the recombinant process could produce unknown effects in human and animal health and environment. Unwanted pollution occurred in Canada where wind, water, insects, and other animals have polluted natural crops of canola with GMO ties, destroying the great biodiversity and the natural production of this crop (Schmeiser 2002).

They are regionally diverse and utilize policultivation, association of crops, rotation, mixed agriculture, fixation of nitrogen from air to soil, biopesticides, traditional methods of soil conservation and food, integral management of water, plagues, and environmental services. The combination of traditional and modern knowledge is consolidating food sovereignty in any region. A biodiverse and regionally adapted use of seeds is conserving diversity of species, and therefore is agro-ecological. This mode of production cannot be globalized. The surplus of production is sold in the local markets and thus reduces environmental pollution and global warming linked to transnational agribusiness and global markets. Local agricultural production and trade, with access for peasants to water, seeds, credits, as well as technical and financial support could promote this model of agriculture. This green model takes women and peasants as key elements for food issues and agricultural consolidation. It encourages the participation of indigenous, women, and peasants in the national and regional definition of rural policies. It can guarantee women access to land for production and livelihood, and through empowerment they can overcome the violent and patriarchal structures inside families, regions, countries, and the global economic system. It includes the right that peasant organizations have developed their own model of food sovereignty and are now struggling for their right to produce and consume healthy, permanent, and culturally accepted food which is locally produced, sold, cooked, and consumed. Governments have the obligation of protecting their economy from subsidized food imports. They have to establish agricultural prices which are able to cover the production costs and to protect the environment. By linking environmental services with farming, land planning, and participative democracy, this paradigm supports a stable rural development and therefore respects the human right for non-migration. When livelihood in villages and countries is guaranteed with public resources for poverty and hunger alleviation, 26 bottom-up efforts can be reinforced. In the medium term, safe ecosystems and stable social relations create synergies and cooperation where safe food and the environment improve public health and cultural diversity at the local level.",

Therefore the evidence is that in most poor countries the total number of hungry people has not been reduced, except for China and India and the former countries of USSR. Rather, new threats of food insecurity are rising. This requires the reformulation of the basic assumption of how to reduce hunger and how to achieve the MDGs. The globalization process in its regressive phase has reversed some advances, but in countries with high population growth that are threatened by severe impacts of climate change and disasters, the eradication of hunger is further limited. Both the 'productivity' and the 'life science' paradigms have also led to higher emissions. Aquifers have collapsed in India and Mexico. Through genetic pollution both models have been destroying the biodiversity of southern countries. Thus, with regard to food security, but also for the survival of humanity and nature, the present understanding of food security has failed to combat hunger. It has rather increased the threats and risks of more serious famine not only in Africa, but worldwide. Imposing food security instead of food sovereignty, and destroying the traditional green production, could become a boomerang also for northern and developed countries.",

Such a new comprehensive security process that combines 'food security' with 'food sovereignty', and also with 'water' and 'health security', may be better able to resolve the food problems of the other half of the world population for whom food security has been an issue of daily survival of their families that avoids the overconsump-tion and loss of life quality with which the food security problems of the OECD world and the elites in the global South are struggling (see chap. 34 by Salih). The discussion has shown that the evolution of the concept of 'food security' within multilateral organizations has failed due to a top-down approach that is neither questioning the demands of the people, nor the interests behind the driving forces of world business. The continuous adaptation of the 'food security' concept and model by FAO reflects its basically technocratic approach that is far away from the real problems of hunger and of agribusiness.
