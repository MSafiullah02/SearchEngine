The incidence of HAdV viremia following allogeneic HCT has been reported as 6%\u201050% in children, and 3%\u201015% in adults. Although variable, most studies reported that HAdV infection including viremia usually occurred within the first 100\u2010180 days after transplantation.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Endogenous reactivation of latent virus was regarded as the major mode of infection; however, de novo infection in nosocomial and community settings could also occur.6, 9 HAdV\u2010attributable mortality is approximately 1%; however, in disseminated cases, the rate may increase up to 80%\u2010100%.6, 7, 10 The major risk factor for severe invasive HAdV disease or dissemination is T\u2010cell depletion, including ex vivo T\u2010cell depletion and use of alemtuzumab. Younger age, unrelated donor graft, cord blood, prolonged immunosuppressive treatment, and an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <300/\u03bcL are additional risk factors.2, 6, 7, 11, 12 With this background, the 4th European Society of Infectious Diseases in Leukemia (ECIL\u20104) recommended routine HAdV monitoring using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood, especially in high\u2010risk patients.7\n",

First, the cumulative incidence of HAdV viremia was lower than those of previous studies. In this study, the cumulative incidences of HAdV viremia at day 100 and 1 year were 2% and 6%, whereas the rates reported in previous studies were 6%\u201050% in pediatric patients.7, 8, 19, 20 One possible explanation is the use of alemtuzumab or ex vivo T\u2010cell depletion, which we do not apply at our center. T\u2010cell depletion is used to reduce GVHD at certain centers, but is also a major risk factor for HAdV infection in HCT recipients because it is associated with significant immunosuppression during the early post\u2010transplant period.21 Therefore, the use of less intensive T\u2010cell depletion strategies at our center may explain the lower incidence of HAdV viremia, especially during the early post\u2010transplant period.6, 20, 22 Second, the onset of HAdV infection appeared to be delayed in our study compared to the results of previous studies. Previous studies including recipients who received alemtuzumab\u2010using T\u2010cell depletion or ex vivo T\u2010cell depletion reported that the majority of HAdV infections occurred before day 100 and were associated with high morbidity and mortality.2, 3, 19, 23, 24 Feuchtinger et al2 conducted a prospective study of 21 children and showed that 90% of HAdV infections with viremia occurred within 3 months after HCT. Lion et al24 also reported that the median onset days of HAdV detection after HCT was 18 days (range, day \u22127 to > day 100). In contrast, seven of 12 HAdV infections (58%) and 3 of 4 HAdV viremia cases (75%) occurred after post\u2010HCT day 100 in our study. The monitoring period should be applied according to the patient's immune status.7 Therefore, it may be necessary to expand regular HAdV monitoring in patients with delayed immune reconstitution.",

In this study, HAdV 3 (n = 5) was identified as the most prevalent type, followed by HAdV 2 (n = 3). In contrast, previous studies that were mostly conducted in European countries reported that species C (HAdV types 2, 1, and 5 in order of frequency) and species A (HAdV 31) were the most prevalent species among pediatric HCT recipients.3, 8, 19 In community infection settings, HAdV 2, 1, and 3 were identified as the most prevalent genotypes in the UK and Croatia, whereas HAdV 3 (37%), 7 (23%), and 2 (11%) were identified as the prevalent types in Korea.13, 25 The results of type analyses in East Asian countries such as Taiwan and Japan also showed that species B (especially HAdV 3) was most prevalent in the community.13, 14, 26 HAdV C is well known for persistent infection in mucosal lymphocytes and tissues. Hence, HAdV C may be more likely to be in latent state before transplantation which can be linked to early post\u2010HCT reactivation. Difference in the prevalence of specific virus types in the community might be one of possible explanations why the incidence of HAdV infection in our study is lower than those of previous studies in European countries.27, 28\n",

Taniguchi et al23 reported that disseminated HAdV infection occurred exclusively in species B virus\u2010infected recipients (HAdV 11 in 5 recipients, 34 and 35 in one recipient, respectively) among 110 Japanese adult recipients with haploidentical HCT. Feghoul et al3 reported surveillance data in 72 French pediatric allogeneic HCT recipients, and suggested that species C was not highly virulent, despite its prevalence. In contrast, Lion et al19, 24 reported that most fatal cases were associated with species C among 132 Austrian pediatric allogeneic HCT recipients. The relationship between HAdV types and clinical severity and/or dissemination remains uncertain, based on current data. Hence, further studies are needed.",
