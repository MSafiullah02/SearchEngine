First, local outbreaks can and do rapidly spread to become epidemics and even pandemics. Given increasingly mobile populations, this trend is set to increase. Second, knowledge and information collected at the global level has the potential to both inform local preparedness and to mobilize in turn global and local resources in a joint response. The response itself has the highest chance of proving successful when it includes local, national, international and global coordination.\nHealth is considered the sovereign responsibility of countries, however, the means to fulfil this responsibility are increasingly global. The International Health Regulations (2005) constitute the essential vehicle for this action. The International Health Regulations were revised a decade ago in order to better protect global health security\u2014specifically, with the aim to prevent, protect against, control and respond to the international spread of disease while avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.4\n\n",

Historically, as seen with regard to Indonesia and its invocation of \u201cviral sovereignty,\u201d as well as in the initial reactions to the EVD pandemic in West Africa, above, fear of suffering (catastrophic) economic and reputational losses due to a declared outbreak was, for a long time, a reason for states to desist from doing so. Thus, in order to incentivize them to report outbreak threats and/or outbreaks, the IHR included the above provision to protect international traffic and trade. With a view toward the future, and as again seen with respect to the international responses mounted to EVD and current to Zika, it becomes clear that international traffic\u2014such as for the Olympic Games\u2014and trade, including in and of medications, play prominent, paramount roles in any disease response. More significant at this stage of Zika appears to be the expansion of the mosquito territories, spreading the virus with it. As such, international traffic and trade, but also vector presence, are both intrinsically and instrumentally tied to disease response and the protection of health.",
