Immunocompromised and elderly individuals are susceptible to COVID19 with a higher risk of mortality.2 Data shows an aggressive course of COVID19 and over 3 times higher risk of death in cancer patients.3 The Healthcare system is under enormous pressure to deal with this constantly changing and ever-evolving crisis. Several countries and provinces are reallocating resources and prioritizing available options in this emergency. Radiation Oncology is an integral part of Cancer care and expected to face significant challenges in the coming weeks as COVID19 continues to impact our lives.4, 5, 6\n",
