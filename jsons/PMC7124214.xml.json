In the first, retrospective data were used to determine whether variations in the frequency of positive viral cultures performed during routine clinical care correlated with variations in the frequency of cases meeting syndromic surveillance criteria for respiratory illness. All children aged 7 years or younger, who presented to the ED during an 11-year period between January 1, 1993, and July 9, 2004, and who had a presenting complaint related to a respiratory illness or who had viral testing performed as part of their routine clinical care were included in this analysis. In the second part, a prospective validation study was performed to validate the use of the clinically collected viral cultures in the retrospective analysis. We chose to perform this validation because the viral tests collected during routine care were not from a systematically selected population known to have an infectious respiratory illness. Subjects in the prospective study consisted of patients presenting to the ED with a respiratory illness between December 7, 2003, and June 19, 2004, who met a specific definition for an infectious respiratory illness. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from these patients and tested for respiratory viruses. By comparing the results of these tests to the historical time series, we were able to measure whether the historical time series was a representative sample of the viral distribution among children with infectious respiratory illnesses.",

Patients were then further screened to determine whether they met our definition of an infectious respiratory illness and were recruited for the study if they did. We defined an infectious respiratory illness as the presence of at least 2 of the following symptoms: fever, cough, sneezing, sore throat, runny nose, or congestion. This criterion was chosen because we sought to determine the viral distribution among patients with respiratory infections and wanted to examine the ability of the surveillance system to track these infectious respiratory illnesses.",

Patients were recruited during a 6-month period from December 7, 2003, through June 19, 2004, for comparison with the patients who had routinely collected specimens during this time. Because of the large number of ED patients treated for respiratory illnesses during the winter, there was only a small overlap between the patients composing the validation group and those who were tested as part of their routine clinical care. The analysis was performed with these patients included and excluded from the study populations. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from all patients in the validation group and tested for RSV, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus. A small number of specimens were not tested for all of the study viruses, because of insufficient volume and a brief shortage of cells for viral cultures in December.

Thus, the effect of influenza is dominated by RSV and can only be uncovered when accounting for the variability of RSV in the model. The model with all covariates explains 81.6% of the deviance in the frequency of presentations for respiratory syndromes.

The first is that tests were not performed to identify several respiratory viruses that may have contributed to the observed burden of respiratory illness, including rhinovirus, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus.19, 20 Although adding 1 or more of these viruses to our study might have changed the attributed variability, our findings of the influence of RSV and influenza virus are quite robust, and it is unlikely that their effect would be negated by the inclusion of the additional viruses in the model. Another potential concern is that biases in test ordering might make the routine viral test results unrepresentative of the patients who presented to the ED with respiratory syndromes. However, the results of prospective testing among ED patients with respiratory problems are closely correlated with the results obtained among the study population, strongly suggesting that the patients tested are in fact representative of the patients presenting with respiratory syndromes. Finally, our analytic methods may be limited by the presence of yearly seasonality in overall respiratory illness and viral prevalence. Although we have attempted to control for seasonal trends by including month as a categorical variable, it is difficult to know whether the correct adjustments were made for this effect.",

This is best demonstrated during the most recent respiratory virus season of 2003 to 2004, during which influenza activity began unusually early in October, peaked in late November to December, and then rapidly declined in January and February.21 RSV followed a typical course with an increase in disease activity beginning in October and peaking in February before gradually declining.22 Laboratory tests at our institution showed peak influenza and RSV activity in December and February, respectively, and presenting complaint-based respiratory syndrome surveillance demonstrated a bifid peak corresponding to this viral activity.",
