They are spherical, enveloped RNA viruses that cause enteric, respiratory and other diseases in humans and animals. In 2012 after the discovery of the Deltacoronavirus in animal species in Hong Kong (Woo et al., 2012), the classification of Coronavirinae subfamily was expanded. There are presently four genera in this subfamily: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gamacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. Five coronavirus strains have been isolated from pigs. These include the Alphacoronavirus species porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). Porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus (PHEV) is a Betacoronavirus and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), a Deltacoronavirus.",

These worldwide outbreaks of PDCoV have caused economic losses to the global commercial swine industry (Chen, Gauger et al., 2015; Chen, Zhu et al., 2015; Homwong et al., 2016; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014).",

The remaining 11 isolates all contained an AAT deletion resulting in an asparagine deletion. Furthermore, strain 06 possessed a GTT deletion, causing a valine deletion. More importantly, a C3447T substitution of its nucleotide sequence changed a glutamine codon into a stop codon, resulting in an 11 amino acid (QPTPSFKFKEW) deletion. Although amino acid deletions and insertions have been reported, it remains unknown whether these have any biological significance to PDCoV pathogenesis.",

Interestingly, these differences were in the S protein and concentrated within the S1 region. According to the two phylogenetic trees established for the S and N genes, 11 of 13 strains clustered within the Chinese category and had the highest nucleotide identities with five published Chinese strains. This indicated that they were more closely related to other strains from China.",

Strain 03 is more related on a genomic scale to the Thai strains and had the lowest nucleotide identity with CHN/GD02/2015 and CHN/GX01/2015 (95.8%, Table S2) (Zhai et al., 2016), which were collected from Guangdong and nearby Guangxi provinces. However, the N gene of this strain revealed a completely reverse conclusion; that it belongs to the Chinese group with a low nt identity (96.7%) with the Thai strains S5011 and 5015L (Janetanakit et al., 2016) (Fig. 2 and Table S3). Therefore, we inferred that a recombination event might occur in PDCoV strain 03.",

And also, it mediates interspecies transmission (Bosch, Van, de Haan, & Rottier, 2003). All coronavirus spike proteins share the same two functional components: an N\u2010terminal subunit and a membrane\u2010anchored subunit (C\u2010terminal) that are covalently bound. The S protein of PDCoV can be similarly subdivided into S1 (1\u2013573 aa) and S2 (574\u20131161 aa) regions (Thachil, Gerber, Xiao, Huang, & Opriessnig, 2015). S1 is a dominant viral antigen and an ELISA is available for its detection (Thachil et al., 2015). Three different groups of S1 proteins from co\u2010viral infections shared less than 12% amino acid sequence identities with each other (Wang, Deng et al., 2016). The B\u2010cell response is directed against the spike protein of coronaviruses (Cao et al., 2015) and it plays an important role in pathogenesis of virus infection.",

Whether this mutation has altered its antigenicity will be interesting to test in the laboratory. Overall, further studies are needed to confirm whether these alterations of B\u2010cell antigenic epitopes and N\u2010glycosylation sites affect the pathogenicity and antigenicity of each PDCoV strain.",
