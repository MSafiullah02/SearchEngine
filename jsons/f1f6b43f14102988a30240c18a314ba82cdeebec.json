In this commentary, based on a very recent research report, we intend to highlight how a new mechanism describing the RAGE transactivation produced by Ang II-mediated ATR1 activation can run continuously and thus, reinforcing a sustained inflammation in lungs, due to the SARS-Cov-2-mediated imbalance of the ACE/And II/ ATR1 pathway.",

Due to the magnitude of this pandemic and its associated costs, and considering that lung injury with severe respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, science cannot afford to rule out any approach to confront this daunting scenario. Although, many vaccine candidates are under development and different anti-RNA viral drugs clinical trials are in course, due to the current urgency to stop the pandemic, it is important to highlight that the more the knowledge generated about inflammatory bronchoalveolar pathophysiology of this disease, the greater the success of the rational design and/or the use of drugs for its treatment.",
