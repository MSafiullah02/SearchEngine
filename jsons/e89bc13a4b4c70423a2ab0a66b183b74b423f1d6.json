Although a wide variety of clinical features have been added over the last 22 years, these major features have stood the test of time. The aim of this chapter is to give a clinical overview of the spectrum of these clinical features, the assessment of aPL, and their impact on morbidity and mortality.",

In autoimmune diseases, especially systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), however, the prevalence is much higher. There have been several large studies of the prevalence of aPL in SLE patients. Perhaps the largest is the Euro-Lupus study that found a prevalence of 24% IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), 13% IgM aCL, and 15% lupus anticoagulant (LA) in a cohort of 1000 patients with SLE [1] . The prevalence of aPL and definite APS may increase with longer follow up, further pregnancies, and repeat testing for aPL. Thus, Perez-Vazquez et al showed that the prevalence of APS increased from 10% to 23% after 15-18 years in a large cohort of SLE patients [2] . A further study of 1000 APS patients has detailed the clinical features of the disorder [3] .",

The risk appears to be higher for LA than aCL but when high titer aCL are considered, the risks are also high. For example, Kearon assessed recurrence rates in 162 patients with \"idiopathic\" DVT participating in a treatment trial where the hazard ratio for recurrence was 2.3 for aCL and 6.8 for LA, although only the hazard ratio for LA was significant in terms of the risk of recurrent thrombosis [21] . In a meta-analysis, Wahl examined the risk of venous thromboembolism in aPL-positive patients without autoimmune disease or previous thrombosis. The odds ratio was 11.1 for LA and 1.6 for aCL. However, that risk rose to 3.2 if higher titers of aCL were examined [22] . There were 90 DVTs in the American Physicians Health Study and aCL levels greater than the 95th percentile [greater than 33 glycophospholipid (GPL) units] had a relative risk of venous thromboembolism of 5.3 [23] .",

The precise reasons for this remain unclear and suggest that additional factors are required for a first thrombotic event or pregnancy-related feature. However, previous events in the context of persistent moderate-to-high aCL levels and/or LA are the most powerful predictors of future events. Thus, in a cohort of 360 patients in the Italian aPL Registry followed prospectively for 3.9 years, with either a positive LA or aCL, 34 patients developed a thrombotic event: an incidence of 2.5%/patient-year, with a rate of 5.4%/patient-year in those with a previous thrombosis and 0.95%/patient-year in asymptomatic subjects [33] . Clearly the mere presence of aPL is not sufficient for an event. Patients with aCL greater than 40 units and previous thrombosis were important risk factors for future events. Similarly, the greater the different numbers of aPL detected in a given patient the greater the risk of thrombosis [34] . The importance of previous thrombosis as a risk factor was highlighted by the recurrence rate in our patients at St Thomas' Hospital, where those with APS and previous thrombosis had a recurrence rate of 20%/patient-year of follow-up [35] . In pregnancy, patients with a prior history of miscarriages or vascular occlusions have a significantly higher rate of adverse pregnancy outcome [33] .",

The complex mechanisms by which aPL may affect platelets and endothelial cells to produce a procoagulant state will be discussed in detail in other chapters. However, evidence is emerging of abnormalities of the vessel wall that may be relevant to APS. Accelerated atherosclerosis is undoubtedly a feature of SLE that contributes to mortality [37] . However, studies in patients without lupus who are aPL positive have shown increased carotid intima-media thickness associated with an increased risk of arterial thrombosis [38] . Another study found a higher prevalence of an abnormal ankle-brachial index in patients with primary APS compared to healthy controls, suggesting widespread vascular abnormalities [39] . Further evidence of vessel wall abnormalities comes from data showing a higher prevalence of renal artery stenosis in association with aPL in patients with SLE. This suggests that vessels that have high velocity turbulent flow may be at increased risk of vascular abnormality in the presence of aPL [40] . Our recent unpublished data suggests a similar phenomenon with coeliac artery stenosis in aPL-positive patients. Even at the capillary level there may be abnormalities. Nailfold videocapillaroscopy in patients with primary APS showed abnormal morphology with smaller capillary diameters than controls, although these changes could not be correlated to impairment of functional parameters [41] . The authors suggested that the smaller capillary diameters resulted in lower local tissue perfusion and hypoxia, although these parameters were not directly measured. If correct though, these conditions would clearly favor a procoagulant state.",

There is a high prevalence among patients with autoimmune connective tissue disorders, especially SLE. There is an association with both venous and arterial thrombosis as well as with pregnancy morbidity, but the strength of association varies amongst studies. This probably reflects different populations, study designs, and different assays and definitions used. In several studies the risk of thrombosis appears to be higher with LA and the data suggests a true association rather than epiphenomenon. In a given patient, both aCL and LA should be measured. A significant impact on long-term survival has been noted and aPL also contribute significantly to accumulated damage in diseases such as SLE. The clinical spectrum of APS features is enormous and continues to expand. It behoves us all as clinicians and health care professionals to consider an early diagnosis of Hughes syndrome, with its distinct clinical and serological features, to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality in our patients.",
