Structured RNA elements in viral genomes and transcripts have the potential to expand the target space for antiviral drug discovery. Precedent for clinically approved RNA-binding drugs is found in natural product-derived antibiotics including macrolides, tetracyclins, oxazolidinones, and aminoglycosides which interact with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of bacteria and block protein synthesis in the pathogens [1, 2] . The well-defined structure of rRNA provides selective binding sites for these antibiotics which serve as a paradigm for RNA recognition by small molecule ligands. RNA elements in viruses have been extensively explored as potential drug targets in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [3, 4] whose genomes include conserved noncoding regions (ncRNA) that may present structured binding sites for small molecules [5, 6] . Challenges and successes in the discovery and design of compounds targeting RNA have been discussed in the previous comprehensive review articles which also provide a historic perspective on past efforts to explore viral RNA targets for small molecule inhibitors [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In the current chapter, I describe progress on discovery and investigation of small molecule ligands for viral RNA targets over the last 2-3 years and include perspectives on potential new viral RNA targets which have not yet been widely explored but may attract interest in pathogens of unmet or emerging medical needs (Table 1) . 2 Viral RNA Targets While many RNA virus genomes and viral transcripts contain structured and conserved noncoding elements, not all RNA motifs may be accessible to selective targeting with drug-like small molecule ligands.

Other potential HIV RNA targets for small molecule ligands include the dimer initiation sequence (DIS), the packaging signal (\u03a8), and the Gag/Pol frameshift site (FSS). Three-dimensional structures have been determined for all HIV RNA regulatory elements by NMR and crystallography studies (Fig. 1) . Previous efforts targeting HIV RNA have been reviewed comprehensively (Table 1) [3, 10, 11, [13] [14] [15] . In Sect. 3, I will discuss more recent studies on discovery of inhibitors targeting the TAR and RRE RNA by screening and scaffold-based design. Transcription of full-length HIV transcripts is stimulated by a complex mechanism that involves host cell factors and a complex of the viral Tat protein bound to the TAR element in the 5 0 leader region of the virus genome [13] . Tat recognizes a conserved RNA stem-loop in TAR with a flexible pyrimidine-rich bulge which adopts a stable conformation in complex with the viral protein, peptide fragments, and small molecule ligands. Structures of TAR complexes determined by NMR revealed a relatively shallow and solvent-exposed ligand binding site in the widened RNA major groove, which in case of Tat-derived peptides extends to the terminal hairpin loop (Fig. 1a) . Disruption of the Tat/TAR complex by competing RNA-binding ligands, including peptides, natural products such as aminoglycosides, and synthetic small molecules, blocks HIV replication [13, 18, 23] . Similarly, the viral Rev protein-RRE RNA complex has been extensively studied as a target for HIV inhibitors [3] . The RRE sequence of~250 bases in the second intron of the viral RNA genome adopts a complex secondary structure which contains a stem-loop (SL-IIB) that serves as the binding site for Rev. Nucleocytoplasmic export of full-length and singly spliced viral transcripts depends on Rev binding to RRE. In contrast to Tat, which recognizes TAR RNA through a beta-sheet domain (Fig. 1a) , the RNA binding of Rev is mediated by an alpha helix that inserts in a widened major groove at the purine-rich internal loop of RRE SL-IIB (Fig. 1b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 238, "end": 241, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 433, "end": 437, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 438, "end": 442, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 443, "end": 447, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 448, "end": 452, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 453, "end": 457, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 458, "end": 462, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 463, "end": 467, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 851, "end": 854, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 855, "end": 858, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 859, "end": 862, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 863, "end": 867, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 868, "end": 872, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 873, "end": 877, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1251, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1881, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1882, "end": 1885, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1886, "end": 1889, "text": "23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2001, "end": 2004, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 760, "end": 768, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 841, "end": 850, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1690, "text": "(Fig. 1a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1711, "end": 1770, "text": "Tat/TAR complex by competing RNA-binding ligands, including", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2377, "end": 2386, "text": "(Fig. 1a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2528, "end": 2537, "text": "(Fig. 1b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus"}, {"text": "The packaging signal resides in the 5 0 leader of the HIV genome, downstream of the TAR element, and directs selective packaging of unspliced viral RNA as a dimer into assembling virus particles.

HCV proteins are translated by a cap-independent mechanism under the control of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5 0 untranslated region (UTR) of the viral (+) ssRNA genome. The HCV IRES adopts a structured fold comprised of four discrete domains which play key roles in the recruitment and assembly of host cell ribosomes. An RNA internal loop motif in subdomain IIa serves as a conformational switch during translation initiation and provides the binding site for selective inhibitors of viral translation. The small molecule ligands capture an extended conformation of the RNA switch and inhibit IRES-driven translation [32] . Discovery of the IRES binding HCV translation inhibitors and studies of their mechanism-of-action have been described in a comprehensive previous review [4] . Here, I will discuss the HCV IRES target ( Fig. 2a ) as well as a recently described G-quadruplex target in the C (nucleocapsid) gene. Progress in the discovery and characterization of HCV translation inhibitors will be outlined in Sect. 3. The HCV IRES element recruits ribosomes to the translation start site of the viral genome, without the involvement of most canoncial eukaryotic initiation factors. Because of this crucial role for viral propagation and the high conservation of the IRES RNA sequence in clinical isolates, this ncRNA element has been recognized early as a potential drug target [35, 36] . Among the first inhibitors of IRES-driven translation described were phenazines [37] and biaryl guanidines [38] identified by high throughput screening against reporter translation in cells. IRES binding was not revealed in these studies but structural features of the two chemical series suggest that the compounds may interact with RNA. Screening for direct binding to the viral RNA was the basis of a highthroughput mass-spectrometry approach that identified 2-aminobenzimidazoles as ligands A three-dimensional model of a ligand-target complex was determined by NMR spectroscopy [34] .

Just recently, a novel class of synthetic antibacterial compounds has been discovered, which exert their activity through an unprecedented mechanism of action that involves targeting a bacterial riboswitch involved in cofactor metabolism [111] . This success story of antibiotic discovery for a bacterial RNA target sets a promising precedent for ligand discovery directed at viral RNAs which provide future therapeutic opportunities defined by the targets' structural complexity, participation in key processes of infection as well as high conservation in the pathogens.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 903, "end": 908, "text": "[109,", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 909, "end": 913, "text": "110]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1159, "text": "[111]", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary"}, {"text": "T.
