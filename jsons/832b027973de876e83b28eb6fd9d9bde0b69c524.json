Ship traffic may complement air traffic as a source of import risk, and cruise ships -with large passenger volumes and multiple stops -are potential hotspots, in particular for diseases with long incubation periods. Vessel trajectory data from ship Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) is available online and it is possible to extract and analyze this data. We illustrate this in the case of the current coronavirus epidemic, in which hundreds of infected individuals have traveled in ships captured in the AIS dataset. This real time and historical data should be included in epidemiological models of disease to inform the corresponding operational response.",

Our analysis of data from Madagascar and the Canary Islands illustrates that island shipping traffic has a broad reach (in these cases, reaching three or more continents within a month) and may potentially carry high volumes of passengers. Even a landlocked city such as Wuhan saw a considerable volume of river traffic in the two-week period prior to quarantine. AIS data makes it possible to visualize individual ship trajectories, along with additional ship information such as vessel type and size. It is simple to filter out, for instance, passenger ships that might have stopped in cities with high risk, as well as to account for their expected arrival times in future ports. The ability to acquire such information in real time might be of critical relevance for operational responses to disease outbreaks.",

A further analysis of cruise traffic specifically found 6 cruises that were scheduled to arrive in Madagascar over the course of November 2017. Generally, these cruises were scheduled to stop in more than one port, and the number of passengers and crew members on board was over 1,200 on average. These cruises therefore represent high-volume points of human contact which in this case would have subsequently visited South Africa, Mauritius, Mozambique, Reunion, Seychelles, and Italy.",
