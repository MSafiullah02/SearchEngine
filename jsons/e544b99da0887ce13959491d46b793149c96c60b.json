This protein is widely distributed in the adult female worm after pairing. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence were employed to analyze the relationship between the RNAi effect and dsRNA dosage in the parasites. The results revealed that the inhibition of SjGCP expression by siRNA is dose-dependent. RT-PCR analysis showed that the SjGCP transcript level was reduced by 75% when 100 nM dsRNA was applied.",

The consequent formation of granuloma and fibrosis are the major pathological effects of schistosomiasis. A unique trait of schistosomes is their sexually dimorphic character. It has been proven that female schistosomes from single-sex infection are stunted in size and sexually immature [2] . Successful schistosome development depends on the correct signaling between male and female parasites during pairing [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , which suggests that schistosomes have a developmental system that requires signaling from the male schistosome to either directly or indirectly activate a number of female-specific gene expressions [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

For RT-PCR, a total reaction volume of 50 \u00b5l containing total RNA (3 \u00b5g), 10 \u00b5l of 5\u00d7reaction buffer, 1 \u00b5l of dNTP (10 mM), 2 \u00b5l of MgSO 4 (25 mM), and primers of SjGCP (15 \u00b5M) (sense: 5'-GGATCCAAGAGCTACACAGACAACAATT-3'; antisense: 5'-GACTCAATAAGTGTAACCGTTGTT-TCAC-3') was processed at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min and 48 \u00b0C for 45 min, following 32 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, at 58\u00b0C for 1 min and at 68 \u00b0C for 1.5 min. The oligos (sense: 5'-AGGCGGGACAGTGTGGTAAT-3'; antisense: 5'-TTG-GAGAAGGAACTACTGAA-3') for \u03b2-tubulin of the schistosome (GenBank accession No. AF220475.2) were amplified in each reaction as a form of constitutively expressed gene control. A relatively low number (32) of amplification cycles was used to keep the PCR reaction in the semi-quantitative range. The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel, scanned by the electrophoresis image analysis system and quantified by the Smartview analysis software.",

As shown in Fig. 2 , in the control parasites or those parasites with irrelevant dsRNA, very strong fluorescence signals were observed in the segment of the gynecophoral canal compared to other tegumental surfaces [ Fig. 2(A,B) ]. In contrast, the fluorescence signal was varied in the same location of schistosomulumes that were treated with different concentrations of dsRNA [ Fig. 2  (C-L) ]. When the parasites were treated with a low dose of dsRNA (12.5 nM), the fluorescence signal from their gynecophoral canal was comparable to that of the control parasites [ Fig. 2(C) ]. As the concentration of dsRNA increased from 25 nM to 50 nM, the fluorescence signal from the parasites was significantly suppressed [ Fig. 2  (D-F) ]. Parasites treated with final dsRNA concentrations ranging from 62.5 nM to 87.5 nM showed very little fluorescence [ Fig. 2(G-I)] . Moreover, when the final concentration of dsRNA continued to increase, the fluorescence signal from the gynecophoral canal almost disappeared [ Fig. 2(J-L) ]. The immunofluorescence results show that dsRNA indeed inhibits the target gene expression in a dose-dependent manner, which is consistent with the SjGCP transcript levels obtained by RT-PCR analysis.",

Pairing between male and female schistosomes is the key process for successful development because there may be some signal molecules that are transducted between the male and female worms. SjGCP is specifically expressed in the adult male worm and its protein is widely distributed in the adult female worm after pairing. From previous studies, it has been found that SjGCP is necessary for the pairing between the male and female worms (data not shown) and RNA interference targeting the gynecophoral canal protein gene in the schistosome shows that SjGCP plays a critical role in the development of the male worm.",

A limited amount of dsRNA per affected cell can efficiently interfere with the expression of the targeted gene in Caenorhabditis elegans [17, 18] . In this study, a simple and convenient soaking method was employed to transfect dsRNAs into parasites. However, as shown above, the transcript level of SjGCP was not significantly suppressed with a low dose of dsRNA (12.5 nM) compared to a high dose of dsRNA (100 nM). It is possible that the soaking method affected the validity of dsRNA entry in the schistosome. We also attempted to transfect dsRNAs into the parasites by using Lipofectamine TM reagent. However, upon transfection, RT-PCR analysis showed that the SjGCP transcript levels did not decrease further (data not shown).",
