They can potentially serve as the cloud condensation and ice nuclei (CCN and IN). Their role in global carbon cycle further highlights importance of studying their variability to link up with climate relevance parameters. Focusing on tropical region reveals that it holds wealthy number of human population and has massive vegetation cover-area. From Indian region, production estimates of bioaerosols from human population (current: *1.25 billion; of which over 45% resides in Indo-Gangetic Plain: IGP) and Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Parks (100 in numbers, situated from north to south and east to west) is not known. Most of the forest fires in India occur during March-June (hot and drier season). The detailed information on chemical composition, fingerprinting and radiative forcing from regional forest fires is also lacking. Unlike natural sources (forest cover and fires), the seasonal variability of pollutants emission characteristic and chemical, optical and radiative forcing are relatively well studied from anthropogenic biomass (post-harvest paddy-and wheat-residue and biofuels) burning emission in India. However, the abundance of bioaerosols and their variability over a large stretch of IGP (north-west to north-east) was not well documented. Towards this, we have undertaken a year-long campaign to study and document (first-attempt) bioaerosols variability over a complete annual cycle from central IGP. We observed a parallel enhancement in concentrations of fine-particulate matter (PM 2.5 in October-November: 158 \u00b1 89 \u00b5g m \u22123 as compared to June-September months: 40 \u00b1 18 \u00b5g m \u22123 ; two-tailed t = 8.2, p < 0.05) and bioaerosols (particularly Gram-negative bacteria: GNB, a source of endotoxin in ambient air; 186 \u00b1 87 CFU/m 3 during October-November as compared to 114 \u00b1 58 CFU/m 3 ; t = 4.0, p < 0.05) with the biomass burning emissions intensification period. The abundance of bioaerosols exhibits influence of ambient meteorology, for example GNB exhibited negative correlations with T, wind speed 93 and heavy (>4 mm daily) precipitation, whereas it showed positive correlations with RH and low precipitation amount (<4 mm).

It is worthwhile mentioning that airborne bacteria could cause severe infections during surgery. It has been observed that reduction of airborne bacteria in operating rooms is directly linked with the substantial decrease in contamination of wounds.

In the atmosphere, they are ubiquitous as bacteria, viruses, fungal spores, bio-debris and pollens (Fi\u0161ar et al. 1990; Lau et al. 2006; Prussin et al. 2015; Reponen et al. 2007; Sesartic and Dallafior 2011) . The size of different types of bioaerosols varies over a large range (Reponen et al. 2001) . For example, viruses are generally of the size of less than 300 nm, bacteria are in the range of 0.3-8 lm, fungal spores in the range of 1-30 lm and size of pollens are greater than 17 lm (Gregory 1973; Stanley and Linskins 1974) . The size of bio-debris (fragments from plants/animals) may vary from sub-micron to coarser fraction (Graham et al. 2003a, b) . It is important to mention here that bioaerosols can adsorb onto existing particles in the ambient atmosphere, and thus, their aerodynamic diameter and residence time can be influenced by the physical characteristics of the suspended particulates (Donaldson et al. 2001; Shaffer and Lighthart 1997) . The contribution of bioaerosols in total particulate matter has been assessed previously from different environmental conditions reporting 28% over remote continental, 22% in populated continental and 10% in remote maritime environments (Matthias-Maser et al. 2000) . A recent study (Zhu et al. 2016 ) has studied quantitatively the contribution of PBAP during daytime and night-time in a temperate coniferous forest in Japan (at Wakayama). They have measured biomarkers of PBAP (fungal spores tracers: arabitol, mannitol and trehalose) through solvent extraction followed by derivatization approach. The contribution of fungal spores in organic carbon (OC) was found to be relatively high in their study during night-time (45%) as compared to that in daytime (22%), and they have attributed this observation to nocturnal sporulation under near-saturated RH condition. Thus, the contribution of bioaerosols to OC can be quite significant over/near the forest/polluted region (Huffman et al. , 2013 .The spatial distribution of Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Parks in India is shown in Fig. 5 .1. They are expected to representing background source of bioaerosols in Indian region and particularly over the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It has been widely realized that bioaerosols play a very important role in climate change through participation in carbon cycle of the ecosystem and holding potential cloud condensation nuclei as well as ice-nucleation activity (Bauer et al. 2003; Fr\u00f6hlich-Nowoisky et al. 2009 , 2016 Garcia et al. 2012; Hawkes et al. 2011 ). In addition, they are widely studied also because of their many allergenic effects on the human health (Annadotter et al. 2005; Balasubramanian et al. 2012; Clark et al. 1983; Domanska and Stroszejn-Mrowca 1994; Semple et al. 2010; Xue et al. 2016) . Human exposure to bioaerosols through physical contact or inhalation may lead to adverse health effects like asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), whooping cough, and sick building syndrome (GBD 2015) . Study to understand their occurrence and effects in indoor and outdoor environments is one of the major thirst areas of research (Iossifova et al. 2007; Kildeso et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2006 ). However, despite being a very important area of research, bioaerosols have been studied little less over Indian region (Ansari et al. 2015; Kumar and Attri 2016; Kumar et al. 2011; Mamta et al. 2015) .

Furthermore, cancer in conjunction with the threat of bioterrorism and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) has increased public awareness on the importance of study on bioaerosols. There are numerous technical methods for sampling bioaerosols and can be employed depending on the sensitivity of the method and the concentration of micro-organisms.

Pollination refers to a process of transfer of pollen grains from male to reproductive structure of female. It can be accomplished via three routes: vectors-wind, water or animals. The flowers of these plants often do not have petals, and thus, anthers (pollen sacs) are directly exposed to air. Hence, pollens from anemophilous plants are most abundant in ambient atmosphere and have tremendous influence in terms of human exposure and related seasonal allergies.

They can cause the aerobic decay of plant materials and are ubiquitous in air, often as the predominant component of bioaerosols. The fungal cell is eukaryotic and embodies a well-developed membrane system. The rigid cell wall is made up of b-glucans and acetyl glucosamine polymers (chitin). Their wall often contains waxes and has extra cellular polysaccharides coating. Fungi can be identified by the method and nature of spore production. Lichens can be formed from the fungi and algae following a symbiotic relationship. Most of the spores and pollens have density near to unity, and thus, their aerodynamic diameter primarily depends on its shape as well as its size. It is worthwhile mentioning that many spores are hygroscopic, and therefore, their aerodynamic diameter increases as a function of increasing humidity. Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites of some fungal species such as Fusarium, Aspergillus, Penicillium and Trichoderma. Fungi causing respiratory infections and allergenic reactions to humans include Penicillium, Cladosporium, Acremonium, Paecilomyces, Aspergillus and Mucor. Most infections (commonest being Aspergillosis) occur in immune-compromised hosts upon inhalation of fungal spores or toxins produced by them. Symptoms include watering eyes, persistent cold, prolonged muscular cramp and joints pain. Histoplasma, Coccidioides and Blastomyces grow in soil or may be carried by bats and birds and are linked with the exposure to airborne/ animal-borne contamination. The volatile organic products released from fungal metabolism have ability to induce irritation in eyes and in the upper respiratory tract.
