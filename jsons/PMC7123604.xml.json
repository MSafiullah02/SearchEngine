Therefore, China is expected to attract more overseas pharmaceutical companies. At the same time, pharmaceutical products rely heavily on the protection of intellectual property rights (IPR), so it is essential for those overseas pharmaceutical companies to have a comprehensive understanding of the corresponding laws and regulations, to adjust their strategy for IPR protection to better benefit from their products in the Chinese market. Up to date, China has gone through a few milestone IPR changes and has established a relatively comprehensive legal system in relation to IPR protection. The core IPR protection is through the implementation of the patent laws and regulations. The state IP office of China and its branches are the key IPR executing agents (Liu 2009) . The intellectual assets are protected by patents, administrative regulations (Table 2.2), trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets (Qu 2010)\n. The patent law (Amendment to Patent Law 2008) is the most important one for IPR protection, which adopted the international standard of novelty examination to conduct drug patent review and approval. In terms of drug patent administration, new articles of parallel importing, compulsory licensing, and the exemption (Bolar exemption) for drug clinical trial and its dossier application are added. To enforce drug patent protection, the new patent law increased administrative penalties for patent violations. These newly added articles provide stronger protection for the IPR.",
