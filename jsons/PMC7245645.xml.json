In LMICs, the lack of accessibility to medications may be due to several factors such as the unaffordability and/or unavailability of drugs and legal restrictions, and may be further complicated by inappropriate medicine use, prescribing by unauthorized individuals, and poor drug quality [6]. As LMICs largely rely on imported pharmaceuticals, the effects of a pandemic and the associated lockdown conditions may result in a lack of availability of essential medicines to treat other comorbidities [7].",
