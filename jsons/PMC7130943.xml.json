            "text": "Shortly after CEPI was created, its interim board adopted a policy regarding \u2018equitable access\u2019 to the vaccines it supports. Its goal was to ensure that low- and middle-income countries would have access to vaccines that CEPI helped develop. The development of that policy was, by many accounts, contentious, and while reflective of the idealism that inspired the creation of CEPI, was felt by others not to be pragmatic or reflect the business realities confronted by vaccine developers. Hence, the interim board instructed that the policy be reviewed \u201cafter one year for initial assessment of alignment between policy and its implementation.\u201d Key provisions of that initial policy are outlined in Table 1\n. While some stakeholders embraced CEPI\u2019s original equitable access policy, other entities, including multinational vaccine companies, expressed serious concerns. In particular, potential industry partners saw the policy as inflexible and not open to negotiation; they would have preferred the elements to be seen as \u2018guidelines\u2019 rather than cast as \u2018policy.\u2019 In short, they did not see the provisions as consistent with a competitive business model. For example, developers were most concerned about losing access to intellectual property that may have been developed, or planned to be used, for another commercial purpose. They were also concerned about the possibility that without cause, CEPI could \u2018step in\u2019 and take over a project, transfer it to a competitor, or share data or results they preferred to keep private for competitive purposes. Finally, they were concerned about the precedent that could be set if they allowed an outside entity, in this case CEPI, to set price of a product unilaterally. In contrast, some civil society and academic partners viewed CEPI as funded largely with public monies, and some expressed concerns that development partners might cease development if they decided it was too difficult or expensive. Some felt that any projects funded with public money should be in the public domain, and that CEPI must take definitive steps to set the price of a vaccine to ensure it would be low enough to be affordable by low- and middle-income countries. These differences in perceptions and the wording of the original policy led several capable vaccine manufacturers with demonstrated track records of bringing vaccines to licensure to declare that they could not work with CEPI under the provisions of the policy.",

First, the Secretariat team reviewed the literature to determine the range of approaches taken to define equitable access and their application. From this review it was clear that the term \u201cequitable access\u201d was widely applied to a variety of domains (e.g. food, water, health care) but its meaning was rarely specifically defined. As such, it was important for CEPI to explicitly describe what it meant by \u201cequitable access\u201d in the context of its specific mission and scope of work. This analysis resulted in an operational definition of equitable access, described at greater length below.",

            "text": "Concomitant with this public consultation process, CEPI was actively negotiating funding agreements with developers. Because CEPI\u2019s partners range from academic institutions and non-profits to government labs biotechnology firms and multinational pharmaceutical manufacturers, it should come as no surprise that they differed significantly in their willingness to accept the terms outlined in CEPI\u2019s initial policy, particularly if implemented flexibly. For example, the academic institutions and non-profits have been involved in early stage development and have not necessarily experienced the complexities of taking a product to licensure. Smaller companies may be bought and sold before they need to consider the implications of IP policies. Larger companies are more likely to be developing vaccines with the expectation that the IP developed will have uses beyond the development of a CEPI-supported vaccine and see the stakes of sharing such IP (or the commercial benefits of its use) to be much greater. Nevertheless, CEPI found that it has been possible to be flexible in its negotiations while remaining true to equitable access principles, working on a case-by-case basis to invent approaches or adapt old ones to get to a mutually desirable result. For example, CEPI has been successful in agreeing on \u201cstep-in rights\u201d or like provisions to enable the organisation to ensure that it can move forward with projects even if its original awardees cannot or will not continue, once the conditions under which those provisions might be activated were defined. Agreements include clear standards on how to determine the cost of goods \u2013 in our case vaccines \u2013 which make discussions on price much more transparent. Agreements have also included commitments to sell vaccines at a price that public-sector agencies agree is affordable for use in the affected territories to ensure that product pricing meets the requirements of the patient populations CEPI serves.",
