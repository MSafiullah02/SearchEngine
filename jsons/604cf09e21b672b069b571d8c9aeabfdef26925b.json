All articles were accurately screened by the two authors, and those reporting data on the eosinophil count in patients with or without severe form of COVID-19 were included in a pooled analysis. The reference list of each document that could be identified with our search criteria was also hand-searched for detecting other eligible studies. A pooled analysis was then carried out, with calculation of the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of eosinophil count in patients with or without the severe form of COVID-19. Mean and standard deviation used for calculating the WMD were extrapolated from sample size, median and interquartile range (IQR), as suggested by Hozo et al. 2 The statistical analysis was performed with MetaXL software Version 5.3 (EpiGear International Pty Ltd., Sunrise Beach, Australia). This study was carried out in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and with the term of local legislation.",
