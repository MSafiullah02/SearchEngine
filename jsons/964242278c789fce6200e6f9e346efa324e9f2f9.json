Biological agents are sorted into three basic groups that would likely to be used as biological weapon -bacteria, viruses and toxins. Examples of high risk bacterial threats include among others anthax (Bacillus anthracis), plague (Yersinia pestis), epsilon (alpha) toxin of Clostridium perfringens and tularemia Francisella tularensis). Examples of high risk viral threats includes influenza, coronaviruses (e.g. MERS and SARS), smallpox and Ebola virus. Examples of high risk toxins include botulinum neurotoxin and ricin. Moreover, biological agents comprise new and re-emerging pathogens as well as intentionally genetically modified infectious agents [2] . A biological threats are typically associated with the deliberate release of a biological agent in an act of terrorism. However, such threat can be a result from an accident in laboratory, as well.",

He is a Director for National Implementation Programme and according to him the national implementation measures should include (1) definitions, (2) prohibitions and penalties, (3) jurisdiction, (4) biosafety and biosecurity, (5) transfer control and (6) enforcement issues. Regarding biological safety and security measures, he said that biosafety measures should mostly focus on prevention of unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins or their accidental release. In contrast to biosafety, biosecurity measures need to concentrate on prevention of unauthorized access, loss, theft, misuse, diversion or international release of biological agents and toxins. Moreover, some specific biosafety and biosecurity procedures should be also established, specifically, a list of controlled biological agents and toxins, national system of notification about accidents, loss or theft, comprehensive record-keeping, physically secure of facilities, professional training on biosafety and biosecurity topics for personnel in addition to secure transportation for biological agents and dangerous goods [58] .",

Additional directives related transportation of dangerous goods are presented below. Safety and security measures related to transport by road, rail and inland waterway are covered by the EU Directive 2008/68 on inland transport of dangerous goods [40].
