Certain sectors of the population are more likely to be affected by social policies and structures that persistently disable them from exiting the social circumstances, which lead to poorer health outcomes. Groups likely to experience poorer health outcomes due to exposure to multiple levels of disadvantage include, but are not limited to, the following: indigenous peoples; those born into poverty or on very low incomes; those living in rural and remote communities; those experiencing job and housing insecurity; people experiencing chronic mental illness, disabilities, or dependence on substances; prisoners; newly arrived migrants; refugees (NSW Department of Health 2004) as well as displaced populations, stateless people, and migrant workers. Even if not driven to address health inequities by a sense of justice and moral obligation, one only needs to consider the economic costs arising from life-long treatments of chronic disease attributable in large part to social determinants of health (Woolfenden et al. 2013) to take action.",

With this renewed knowledge and insight, we can perhaps now address long-standing health inequities. Decisively, addressing the social determinants of health will involve local and international contributions, as health inequities exist locally, nationally, regionally, and globally. All sectors of society will need to play their part: from all areas of government (and not just health departments), the business sector, civil society, and local communities, as well as international agencies, such as the World Health Organization (Marmot et al. 2008).",

The areas considered include the following: income and wealth, employment and access to health services, housing, food environment, education, and safety. Examples are given to highlight the way health inequities play out for different groups but it should be remembered throughout that one form of disadvantage often leads to being impacted by other forms. For example, inability to access education will most often impact on health, and life more broadly, in numerous direct and indirect ways at various stages of a person\u2019s life.",

Governments responded decisively offering a range of relief measures including unemployment benefits, which in some jurisdictions doubled overnight (Lawson 2020; Services Australia 2020) despite years of resistance to do so even when urged to by organisations such as The Australian Council of Social Service and the Business Council of Australia (Business Council of Australia 2012; Murphy 2020).",

In addition to increased exposure to the virus, these workers are also at higher risk because they are often unable to access free healthcare and paid sick leave, which could encourage them to continue working even if unwell (Parker 2020). Even where jobs have survived, single-parent families with young children are potentially still at risk of losing their jobs, as social distancing measures preclude family members from looking after young children who cannot be left at home unattended. While holding a job during this crisis is life-saving for poorer families, the very fact that the bread winner is more exposed to contracting the disease also exposes whole families to this risk, which is particularly high when large or extended families occupy sub-optimal housing, as discussed below.",

The general population of many developed countries does not consume a sufficient variety of foods from the various food groups recommended by health authorities, often leading to the development of chronic conditions (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2018). For millions of people around the world, however, the concern is of a more urgent nature; there is simply not enough food. According to the World Food Programme, a staggering 821 million people are undernourished, i.e. \u2018\u2026an individual\u2019s habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the amount of dietary energy required to maintain a normal, active, healthy life\u2019 (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO 2019, 189). These people do not have the ability to secure access to food and hence suffer from what is widely known as \u2018food insecurity\u2019, which is also experienced by millions of people in prosperous countries, for example, by low income earners who are often of specific ethnic backgrounds and have a lower education (Gundersen and Ziliak 2015), and unsurprisingly, homeless people (Crawford et al. 2014). In addition to creating a new category of people in need of emergency food because of job losses, this pandemic has exacerbated food insecurity experienced by disadvantaged groups in wealthier nations but also by those depending on international aid as a result of supply chain disruptions and movement restrictions.",

Even where internet access and harware are not an issue, remote learning requires parental involvement and support, which is often not available in some families due to complex socioeconomic factors; it requires adequate dedicated space for study, an environment free of disruption, and multiple devices for families with more than one child. The absence of such features is sure to have a negative long-term impact on children already disadvantaged academically and socially with a subsequent impact on their health and well-being, especially if remote schooling extends over a long period. Children whose countries have not instituted closures may also be impacted adversely, as their parents may be reluctant to send them to school for fear of them contracting the disease (WFP, FAO, and UNICEF 2020).",
