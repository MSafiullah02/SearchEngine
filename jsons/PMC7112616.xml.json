Typically, industry evaluations of the performance of the hospitality industry are based on average occupancy rates and average room rates, by revenue per available room (Wassenaar & Stafford, 1991), or by breakeven room occupancy (Wijeysinghe, 1993). Such indicators, however, only give a single dimensional snapshot of the intricate hotel industry. Anderson, Fish, Xia, and Michello (1999) point out the difficulty of drawing conclusions about the relative productivity of the hotel industry without simultaneously considering the mix and nature of services provided.

DEA is a non-parametric, multi-factor, productivity analysis tool that utilizes multiple input and output measurements to evaluate a number of relevant decision making units' (DMUs) relative efficiency. For the regional hotel sector, technical efficiency refers to a comparative measure of the effectiveness with which evaluators use a given set of inputs, such as labor and capital, to produce a targeted set of outputs, such as revenue and room occupancy. When explicitly taking into account the mix of service outputs produced, DEA is best suited to the comparison or benchmarking of a number of similar operational units (Donthu, Hershbergerb, & Osmonbekove, 2005).",

Recently, Chen (2009) also recognizes that the performance evaluation factors in the hospitality industry are multi-dimensional in nature and can hardly be aggregated using price or cost figures, and he acknowledges the usefulness of the DEA technique in the hospitality industry. Chen (2009) proposes a modified DEA model to measure the performance of a Taiwanese hotel chain. Similarly, Botti, Briec, and Cliquet (2009) apply the DEA method to examine French hotel chains, and they conclude that no specific organization form (e.g., plural forms versus franchise and company-owned systems) is more efficient than another. Motivation for the present study comes from the fact that the majority of DEA studies in the hospitality industry are static in nature, based mainly on cross-sectional data at the individual level of hotel entities. The present study assesses the hotel industry at the aggregate level of the regional hotel sector coupled with a dynamic analysis of DEA, monitoring technical efficiency and stability behavior over time. The study also identifies the critical antecedents of technical efficiency. Previous research focuses on the micro contextual factors (Hwang and Chang, 2003, Yang and Lu, 2006), however, the influence of macro socio-economic factors needs further consideration. The present study partially fills the gap by focusing attention on the antecedents of technical efficiency at the regional hotel sector level in China.",

Based on the obtained relative efficiency measures together with their fluctuations over time, the paper extends the DEA application within the literature by introducing a novel two-dimensional efficiency-based matrix to assess the competitive advantage of different regions of the Chinese hotel sector. The designated matrix serves not only as a tool for market segmentation, but also as a thoughtful basis for strategic decision-making and performance management that would be of help to government decision-makers, hoteliers/investors, and destination management organizations (DMOs). The methods of analysis mentioned above appear appropriate as the studied period (i.e., 2001\u20132006) includes an exogenous event of a destabilizing impact (i.e., SARS in 2003).",

More specifically, for each DMU, the study calculates a single relative ratio by comparing total weighted outputs to total weighted inputs for each unit without requiring any specific functional form. W\u00f6ber's (2002) book provides more details.

First, most DEA studies in the hospitality industry, including a recent study by Perrigot, Cliquet, and Piot-Lepetit (2009), focus on the performance of hotels at the cross-sectional level. Though the outcome may still be useful, a dynamic context sheds additional light on the trend of DMUs' relative efficiency. Trend analysis can give rise to a seemingly excessive use of resources intended to produce beneficial results in the future. As such, researchers should prefer panel data (i.e., balanced longitudinal data) over purely cross-sectional data in that they not only enable researchers to compare a DMU with its counterparts but also allow them to track an individual DMU over a period of time for movement in efficiency (W\u00f6ber, 2002).",

According to studies presented in Table 1 (e.g., Anderson et al., 2000, Barros, 2005), input resources for the hotel industry include variables such as staff, capital and equipment. These resources produce tangible and intangible services through front office and back office operations (Yasin, Czuchry, & Dorsch, 1996). The present study employs three input indicators: (1) total number of full-time employees in a regional hotel sector; (2) total number of guest rooms in a region; (3) total fixed assets in a regional hotel sector. Outputs are often concrete measurements that an organization uses to see if its objectives are met (Hwang & Chang, 2003). Thus, the analysis includes the following output indicators: (1) total revenue comprised from the revenue generated by room occupancy, food and beverage service, and other sources such as laundry, night clubs, and service fees; (2) average occupancy rate calculated by taking total occupied room-nights as a percentage of total available room nights. Haugland, Myrtveit, and Nygaard (2007) employ two input variables (i.e., number of hotel rooms and number of employees) and two output variables (i.e., sales revenue and occupancy rate) to calculate efficiency scores among 101 Norwegian hotels. More recently, Pulina et al. (2010) employ one input variable (i.e., labor costs) and two output variables (i.e., sales revenue and generated value added) to obtain efficiency scores among 20 Italian hospitality regions. The fact that four out of five variables used in the current study are the same as the parameters used in Haugland et al.'s (2007) article and two out of the three variables considered in Pulina et al.'s (2010) paper are used in this research paper indicates that the input and output measures of the present study are in accordance with recent DEA research in the hotel industry.

The table classifies each region into a quadrant according to (1) whether the mean efficiency is greater or less than .85 (the mean of all efficiency scores) and (2) whether the standard deviation is greater or less than .06 (the mean of all standard deviations). Consequently, each of the 31 DMUs fall into one of four quadrants according to its technical efficiency characteristics:A.\nZone of high efficiency and high stability, where the regional hotel sector is operating consistently at high efficiency. The nine regions in the quadrant are the hospitality flagships: Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Henan, Guizhou, Chongqing, Hunan and Anhui. Hotel sectors in these regions are on the right track. They should maintain their stability and efficiency advantage, and seek to make further improvements. Note that the top tourist attractions (namely national 4A grade tourist attractions) located in these nine regions account for approximately 40% of all of China's top tourist attractions, indicating that these regions possess relatively more attractive tourism resources. The tourist attraction factor contributes to inducing domestic and foreign tourists, thus creating a stable market for the local hotel sector.B.\nZone of high efficiency but low stability, where the regional hotel sector is currently operating at high efficiency but is relatively inconsistent over time. Five DMUs (i.e., Beijing, Shanxi, Jiangxi, Qinghai, and Ningxia) are found in the quadrant. These five regional hotel sectors need to investigate the factors influencing the variability of their efficiency so that they may improve stability and maintain a secure efficiency advantage over time.C.\nZone of low efficiency and low stability, where the regional hotel sector is operating at low efficiency and is relatively inconsistent over time. The quadrant includes eight DMUs, consisting of Tibet, Shannxi, Yunnan, Gansu, Hainan, Shongdong, Tianjin and Heilongjiang. Unique trends are observed within this group. Specifically, Tibet, Shannxi, Yunnan and Hainan exhibited deteriorating behavior during the period of 2001\u20132006, while Shongdong, Tianjin and Heilongjiang exhibited improving performance, and Gansu showed a mixed performance of improvement and deterioration over time.D.\nZone of low efficiency but high stability, where the regional hotel sector is operating consistently at a relatively low level of technical efficiency. Nine DMUs belong to the quadrant: Liaoning, Hubei, Hebei, Guangxi, Sichuan, Fujian, Inner Mongolia, Jilin and Xinjiang. These regions are clearly behind other regions in terms of hotel technical efficiency. This group accounts for much of the poorer performance of the Chinese hotel industry over time. DMOs in these regions need to examine the underlying problems associated with the low efficiency and find a way to surpass their better performing counterparts.\n",

Thus, the study further analyzes technical efficiency scores using a dynamic Tobit regression model (with the GLM heteroskedasticity-robust variance matrix estimators) to identify potential antecedents of technical efficiency for the Chinese hotel industry. Since the technical efficiency of a region's hotel sector would range between zero and one (a region with an efficiency value of one (1) is located on the frontier and is considered to be the most efficient DMU in the pool, while a region with a lower score implies less efficiency), the dynamic Tobit model is an appropriate method for estimating the relationship between the designated explanatory variables and a truncated dependent variable.

Notably, industrial organization (IO) economics identify industry attractiveness as the primary foundation for superior profitability (Grant, 1991), which implies that hotel operation is concerned primarily with seeking favorable market environments and a moderate level of competition. In particular, the resource-based theory of traditional IO economics emphasizes that resources are the cornerstone of a firm's profitability (Conner, 1991), while the structure\u2013conduct\u2013performance (SCP) paradigm emphasizes that structural characteristics of an industry have a sizable influence on the performance of firms within an industry (McWilliams & Smart, 1993). Accordingly, subjecting the performance of hotels to tourism resource and attractiveness, market competition and regional trade openness would be advantageous. In addition, empirical studies indicate that employees' education and earning levels influence a firm's performance (Holzer, 1990, Ismail and Sulaiman, 2007). Therefore, the independent variables of the proposed model are the historical average technical efficiency score (HTE), richness of tourism resource (RTR), international tourism attractiveness (ITA), education (EDU), payment levels of employees (EARN), market competition (NH), regional trade openness (TO), and a time (2003) dummy variable (DUMMY). The study undertakes this examination by estimating the following dynamic Tobit regression model:TE=\u03b1+\u03b20HTE+\u03b21(RTR)+\u03b22(ITA)+\u03b23(EDU)+\u03b24(EARN)+\u03b25(NH)+\u03b26(TO)+\u03b27DUMMY+\u03b5.\n",

Second, international tourism attractiveness (ITA), indicated by the proportion of inbound arrivals, shows a positive influence (p-value = .07) on regional hotel sectors' technical efficiency. That is, as a region receives more inbound arrivals, its hotel sector tends to operate at higher technical efficiency. Inbound arrivals may indicate longer duration of travel and higher travel budget than that of domestic tourists.

For example, when studying technical efficiency in Malay manufacturing firms, Ismail and Sulaiman (2007) suggest that education is negatively correlated with technical efficiency in the food and beverage industry, while the education effect is not statistically significant in other industries (e.g., metal and fabricated metal products, paper products, etc.). According to a recent study of the hotel general manager profile in China, unlike their counterparts in the international market, only a small number of Chinese hotel general managers have university degrees in hospitality, while having more than nine years of hotel managerial experience on average (Li, Tse, & Xie, 2007).

On one hand, theoretical support for a positive relationship can be found among the proponents of endogenous growth theories (Lucas, 1988). The assumption is that high trade openness (i.e., represented by high share of imports and exports to GDP) favors the adoption of new technology and the use of a region's resources to produce aggregate output, and leads to more efficient production (Christopoulos, 2007, Edwards, 1998). On the other hand, Rodriguez and Rodrik (2000) are skeptical of this theoretical proposition and claim that the empirical evidence to date does not provide enough convincing evidence. This relationship requires further examination.",

Strategic market implications for hoteliers, government decision-makers, and destination management organizations (DMOs) are presented. As a result, the findings enhance the understanding of hotel efficiency evaluation in a dynamic setting. The study reveals an overall low efficiency measure during the SARS outbreak in 2003 as shown in Fig. 1, and the dynamic Tobit regression findings in Table 5 confirm this result.",

The research detects a statistically significant and negative correlation between average efficiency scores and their standard deviations, suggesting that DMUs with relatively low average efficiency are most likely to have high dispersion. Based on the level of technical efficiency observed over time, the study classifies hotel sectors in the 31 regions into four categories. Regarding the two-dimensional efficiency-based matrix in Table 4, government decision-makers and hoteliers can gain insight into the benchmarked best practice (i.e., those DMUs in the zone of high efficiency and high stability) in the Chinese hotel industry. Nevertheless, researchers should interpret the empirical findings with caution as the DEWA outcome could be different when other inputs and outputs are employed in the analysis.",

Given the underlying differences between China and western countries, conducting a cross-national study, comparing the efficiency of the hotel sector industry between China and a sizable western country like the United States would be of value. Furthermore, researchers may conduct further study in a broader global setting (e.g., using hotel industry data from both developed and developing nations) to shed light on the operational efficiency of the global hotel industry. Effective practice of benchmarking would be an aid to better decision making as part of the overall global investment process.",
