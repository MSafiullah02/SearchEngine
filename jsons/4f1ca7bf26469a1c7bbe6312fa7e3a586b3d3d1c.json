Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China and spread globally to become a public health emergency of international concern(2). Patients with COVID-19 tend to progress after onset of symptoms within 7 days(1) and severe type may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or end-organ failure (3, 4) . Therefore, early and simple identification of patients who require intensive respiratory or vasopressor support (IRVS) would be of considerable value during the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis. Thus far, there are no effective severity assessment tools for patients with COVID-19.",

The AUC, optimal cut-off value, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of each score system were shown in Table 2 . The optimal cut-off score of CRB-65 for prediction of IRVS was 2, which provided sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 93.4%. The AUC values of the CRB-65 score in predicting the need for IRVS were much higher than those for the qSOFA score (0.81 \u00b1 0.05 vs. 0.70 \u00b1 0.06, P=0.02). The CRB-65 had higher AUC values than CRB score for IRVS prediction, however, the difference was not statistically significant (0.81 \u00b1 0.05 vs. 0.77 \u00b1 0.05, P=0.22).

It seems that qSOFA is more accurate than the CRB score for predicting IRVS. However, in this study, the AUC values of CRB and qSOFA scores were comparable without statistically significant differences. After including the parameter of age, the CRB-65 score performed better than the qSOFA score in predicting requirement of IRVS. As age \u2265 65 years was included in the CRB-65 score, it provided additional predictive performance compared with the CRB score. This result was supported by previous reports, which showed that age was an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with COVID-19(5, 6).",

Patients with confirmed COVID-19 and age \u226518 years hospitalized between February 7, 2020 and February 17, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were screened in this study. Patients were excluded if they died within 48 h of admission, were pregnant, or had a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order. Baseline demographics, co-morbidities, clinical symptoms or signs, vital signs, laboratory results on admission, and outcomes were collected. The CRB, CRB-65, CURB-65 and qSOFA scores were calculated on basis of demographic and clinical characteristics of each patient. A total of 116 patients were eventually included for this study. The baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. The median age of this cohort was 63[IQR 51 to 72] and 47.4% patients were males. The most common symptom was fever (86.2%), respectively. A total of 25 (21.6%) patients needed IRVS during the period of hospital stay. Patients with IRVS had higher CRB (1[0,2] vs. 0[0,0], P \uff1c 0.001), CRB-65 P=0.001) than non-IRVS patients. The hospital mortality rate in this cohort was 7.8%. The median length of hospital stay was 29 [18,36] days.",
