This novel coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has been causing respiratory infections with fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and myalgias as the most common signs and symptoms [2,3]. As of April 2, 2020, there have been over 1 million cases reported worldwide with 53,000 deaths. More severe respiratory illnesses and deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in elderly patients, who are also at greater risk of developing altered mental status. A few studies have reported neurologic manifestations in this age group including acute cerebrovasc\u03bcLar diseases (CVA), impaired consciousness, and skeletal muscle injury [4]. We report a case of a middle-aged man with COVID-19 who developed acute encephalopathy and tonic-clonic seizure activity.",
