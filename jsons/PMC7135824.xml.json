Most fatalities are among children and young adults; this is in contrast to WNV, in which the older adult population is at greatest risk.

            "text": "Malaria is a disease with the potential to be rapidly fatal. It differs from the aforementioned diseases in that there are specific treatments available. Malaria is caused by protozoa of the genus Plasmodium. There are four kinds of malaria that can affect humans: Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae. Malaria occurs in more than 100 countries. Endemic regions include Central and South America, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Africa, India, and Southwest Asia. The World Health Organization estimates an annual incidence of greater than 300,000 cases with a mortality of greater than 1 million [22]. Mortality is seen primarily in small children who have not developed immunity. The annual incidence is approximately 1200 cases in the United States [15]. P. falciparum causes most malaria deaths. It is prudent to maintain a high index of suspicion in any recent traveler with a fever because malaria is one of the most common causes and is missed frequently. It can be rapidly fatal and must be ruled out with peripheral thick and thin smears. Although malaria is found throughout the tropics, various countries are endemic to specific species. P. falciparum is the predominant species in Africa, with the presentation of symptoms usually developing within 1 month. In contrast, P. vivax is rare in Africa because Africans generally lack an antigen on the surface of the red blood cell (Duffy antigen) necessary for the parasite to penetrate [4]. P. vivax predominates in Asia and Latin America; symptoms develop within 1 month only 50% of the time [5].",

The temperature may not be elevated at the time of presentation, although most patients report fevers at some point during their illness. This situation presents a diagnostic challenge and may account for one of the reasons why patients may make several visits to health care professionals before a diagnosis of malaria is considered [23]. Other reasons include lack of familiarity with tropical disease coupled with the initial presentation occurring weeks to months after travel.

Alternative medications are available, and it is advisable to contact the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention malaria hotline before travel [16]. Personal protective measures also are recommended. Recognizing that transmission occurs primarily between dusk and dawn, one can reduce contact with mosquitoes during that time. These measures include insecticide-treated nets when sleeping, remaining in well-screened areas, covering the body with clothes, and applying DEET insect repellants as needed [25].",

RMSF is noted to be the most lethal tick-vector illness in the United States. It also has been reported throughout southern Canada and Central and South America. RMSF is an elusive diagnosis to make. Approximately 40% of patients do not report a history of a tick bite. Because of the nonspecific nature of the initial symptoms and the potential severity of disease, therapy often must be initiated without confirmation of disease. RMSF is a misnomer because the disease is located predominantly in the southeastern United States [28].

The rash usually follows the onset of fevers and may not be present for several days after the onset of initial symptoms. Usually the rash begins as macules on the wrists, forearms, and ankles and initially may blanch with pressure. It is not until day 6, however, that the petechial rash develops on the palms and soles.
