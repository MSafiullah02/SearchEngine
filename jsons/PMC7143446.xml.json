            "text": "For centuries, cities have faced challenges caused by the horizontal expansion of urban areas, such as urban sprawl, health and sanitary issues, and inhumane housing conditions (Mumford 1961). After the 1970s, globalization and neo-liberalization brought new urban challenges to cities in developed countries. Divided cities (Fainstein et al. 1992), residential segregation (Grobmann et al. 2015; Knox and Pinch 2000), and income polarization (Hulchanski 2010) are among the most discussed issues in urban studies in this context. Debates on the divided city reveal how the globalized economy has transformed the spatial structure of cities such as New York and London. Many global cities have also experienced a transformation in the labor market, shifting from a manufacturing orientation toward domination by financial and service industries in the city center (Fainstein et al. 1992). As global cities have become the sites of production and coordination (Sassen 1991), their spatial patterns have also been transformed and are now characterized by more division, inequality, polarization, and fragmentation (Sassen 2014; Scott 2019). In addition, globalization has accelerated competition among cities, and many municipal governments have moved toward entrepreneurialism (Gonzalez 2018). This move has been followed by real estate developers building multi-functional condominiums in city centers, targeting single women, high-income couples, urban elites, and the creative classes (Florida 2002; Kern 2010; Koizumi et al. 2011; Kubo and Yui 2011a; Scott 2019).",

This shift followed the factory production of the nineteenth century and the mass production and emergence of metropolitan urban forms in the twentieth century (Scott 2017). Globalization has transformed the role of city regions and urban governance, promoting spatial restructuring on many scales such as within individual metropolitan areas and city centers, as well as in national and international urban networks.The fact of inter-urban competition and urban entrepreneurialism has opened up the urban space of the advanced capitalist countries to all kinds of new patterns of development, even when the net effect has been the serial reproduction of science parks, gentrification, world trading centers, cultural and entertainment centers, large-scale interior shopping malls with postmodern accouterments, and the like. The emphasis on the production of a good local business climate has emphasised the importance of the locality as a site of regulation of infrastructural position, labour relations, environmental controls, and even tax policy vis-\u00e0-vis international capital.

            "text": "To succeed in the face of global and domestic competition, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government adopted a policy of entrepreneurialism (promoting the \u201cnew patterns of development\u201d mentioned in the above quote) beginning in the first decade of the twenty-first century (Boland 2007; Gonzalez 2018; Jacobs 2005). This policy shift not only increased the number of urban condominium developments (Kubo and Yui 2011a) and encouraged population recovery (Miyazawa and Abe 2005; Yabe 2003) but also intensified the growth of inequality within the Tokyo metropolitan area (Hirayama 2005; Jacobs 2005). Urban growth in central Tokyo and shrinkage in the suburbs became obvious (Kubo 2015), and the emergence of \u201chot and cold spots\u201d divided the city, even in central Tokyo, because entrepreneurial urban policies exacerbated the unevenness of urban development (Smith 1990; Hirayama 2005). The neo-liberal national policies that stimulated urban renewal through the deregulation of urban planning, building standards, and the housing market (e.g., the Urban Renaissance Special Measure Law of 2002) strongly supported the re-growth of central Tokyo from the beginning of the twenty-first century onward. For instance, the deregulation of the floor\u2013space ratio enabled super high-rise buildings in commercial and industrial areas in central Tokyo, offering bonus floor space to projects providing vacant public spaces that could serve as evacuation sites in natural disasters or other emergencies (Kubo 2014; Abe et al. 2018). New-build gentrification, ranging from the development of vacant commercial, industrial, or reclaimed land to super high-rise buildings, has transformed central Tokyo\u2019s landscape since the beginning of the twenty-first century (Lutzeler 2008). Additionally, many areas surrounding train stations and airports offered large tracts of vacant land that was well-suited to huge urban renewal projects. With the facilitating influence of municipal policies, these areas were targeted for new urban development in Tokyo and other large Japanese cities.\n",

In this chapter, we examine how urban and housing policies have affected urban spatial structures, caused a divide between the city center and the suburbs, and transformed the urban lifestyle in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Starting with a chronicle of urban policies in Japan, we review the post-war housing policies that stimulated suburban homeownership and the horizontal expansion of the Tokyo metropolitan area. Then, the recent spatial restructuring accompanying the emergence of urban governance under globalization is examined. We focus on the housing market from the beginning of the twenty-first century onward and on aviation governance. Through globalization, transit hubs such as airports have gradually become centers of urban development projects, known as transit-oriented development. Focusing on aviation governance as a case study helps to clarify the spatial restructuring that has occurred in recent decades in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The discussion is positioned within the context of the transformation of the spatial structure of the Tokyo metropolitan area in modern times.",

After the Meiji Restoration in the 1870s, which opened Japan to new influences and industrial progress, a civil law was passed establishing, that is, ie-seido (the family institution). Japan had had a long history as a feudal society in which traditional lords and families owned most of the land and houses. However, this new law passed in the late Meiji era categorized people by family unit or parentage and allowed them to select their jobs and place of residence. The law also allowed people to own real estates, such as houses and land if desired, although the family patriarch made decisions regarding the latter. Therefore, the history of land and house ownership by individuals in Japan is relatively short. Even as recently as 1941, the homeownership rate was only 22% in major Japanese cities (Ronald 2008).",

As a result, the other sons and the daughters left the original family and formed new families through marriage. This meant that the younger sons (i.e., the male heads of the new families) needed to find jobs in other areas, which led to residential mobility from rural areas to the growing, densely populated urban zones. Thus, the housing custom based on the patriarchal family institution, which was supported by the ideology that homeownership should be dominated by men, was legally codified in Japan (Ronald 2004). Because few women had paying jobs, they lived with their parents until marriage. A few exceptions were found in metropolitan centers such as Tokyo and Osaka. For example, in Tokyo, rental apartments for working women were built by Dojunkai, a government institution for housing development established for the purpose of urban reconstruction after the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 (Kageyama 2004). In general, however, there were few possibilities for women to own houses or to overcome the patrimony that was dominant during this period.",

Little attention was paid to the notion that these areas should be self-sufficient or to the conception that workplaces are to be located near residential areas. The main concern was how to create a good residential environment for urban and rural settlements (Suzuki 2000).",

Similar developments emerged in the Nagoya metropolitan area, where municipal planners adopted the idea of \u201cSan-rin Toshi\u201d (literally meaning \u201cForest City\u201d), constructing hillside developments in the Yagoto area (Hotta 1995).

This Act was characterized by a hierarchical framework comprising national, regional, and prefectural levels of administration. In the 1950s, the most urgent issue that housing policies had to address was the housing shortage after the war. The national government established major housing policies for this purpose. For example, the Japanese Housing Finance Agency was set up in 1950 to finance homeownership by high-income families. Following this, the Japan Housing Corporation began developing housing complexes in 1955 and later developed huge housing estates in the suburbs to supply affordable housing for middle-income people. The government also built social housing for less affluent families (Japan Federation of Housing Organizations 2002; Kageyama 2004).",

This led to the creation of the Tokaido megalopolis and turned other areas into shrinking regions (Abe et al. 2018). One example is the change in procedures regarding social housing, which from the 1950 to the 1960s was preferred by young married couples who wanted to save money to buy their own homes in the near future. They tended to spend the years when their income was relatively low dreaming of climbing the housing ladder leading to homeownership. Later, because the income restriction became stricter over time, social housing came to accommodate mainly low-income households, single-parent families, and single older adults (Hayakawa 1997; Yui 1993, 1996).",

Consequently, the closure of central shopping streets and the aging of shop owners accelerated the process of decline. Gradually, an empty space expanded in many Japanese cities (Shinohara 2011). In major metropolitan areas, suburbanization led to population loss in the city centers. To deal with this problem, the national government passed the Urban Renaissance Special Measure Law  in 2002, a neo-liberal spatial policy promoting deregulation in urban planning, land use, and housing supply. Through city center redevelopment, governments expected to overcome the long-term economic recession and stimulate rebuilding projects to increase the number of disaster-proof buildings (Abe et al. 2018). This policy strengthened the power of central Tokyo and facilitated recovery in terms of both population and economic activity in the first decade of the twenty-first century (Koizumi et al. 2011; Miyazawa and Abe 2005; Yabe 2003). By the next decade, the spatial divide between the growth in the city centers and the lower levels of investment and greater aging in the suburbs became inevitable (Hirayama 2005; Kubo 2015; Kubo et al. 2017; Yui et al. 2016, 2017; see also Chaps. 10.1007/978-981-15-4202-2_3, 10.1007/978-981-15-4202-2_4, and 10.1007/978-981-15-4202-2_6).",

The boom was fueled by migrants from Japan\u2019s rural areas who relocated to major growing cities such as Tokyo in search of jobs (Tani 1997). Consequently, the rate of homeownership had reached 60% at the beginning of the 1960s (Hirayama and Ronald 2007). Soaring central city land prices in the 1980 and land-oriented property ownership, the so-called \u201cmyth of real property,\u201d strengthened the new preference for detached houses in the suburbs (Van Vliet and Hirayama 1994).",

This stagnation has led to the neglect of old industrial sites, the selling of company housing to allow companies to survive the recession, and the expanding unused reclaimed land along the river and bay areas in cities, which increased the availability of land for redevelopment.

Suburban areas began to face challenges caused by the aging of their residents and an increase in vacant housing (Kubo and Yui 2019; Naganuma et al. 2006; Yui et al. 2016, 2017). Both the aging of the remaining residents and the out-migration of the younger generations increased population aging in many neighborhoods (Kubo et al. 2010; Nordvik and Gulbrandsen 2009; Yui 1999). According to the Statistics Bureau of Japan\u2019s Housing and Land Survey (2013), more than 50% of owner-occupied houses were either newly built or newly purchased, and a strong preference for newly built houses dominated the owner-occupied market. In contrast, only 13.7% of owner-occupied houses were previously owned by others. The fragile existing housing market and dramatic decline in mobility after homeownership in Japan have increased the percentage of older adults in the population of homeowners.",

Tokyo will host the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2020  (Tokyo 2020 will be postponed until 2021 due to the expansion of COVID-19), encouraging more public investment in the economic development of the city\u2019s central area (Gonzalez 2017).

In these years, many potential homeowners were the children of post-war baby boomers and had grown up in metropolitan suburbs. Because their parents had owned real estate in major metropolitan areas, this group of potential homeowners tended to have preferences regarding lifestyle and the family\u2013housing relationship that differed from those of their parents. They preferred living in condominiums in the city center over moving to the suburbs to purchase a home. The growth in the number of condominiums has facilitated this new lifestyle trend.

Kubo (2014) has noted that this deregulation of the mortgage market strengthened the diversification of long-term housing loans by private banks and public institutions, on which most first-time homeowners depend. For example, before 2005, the Japan Housing Finance Agency (formerly the Government Housing Loan Corporation) provided long-term, low-interest housing loans called \u201cFlat 35,\u201d which had an average annual interest rate of less than 3.0%. Other private finance agencies providing long-term housing loans for middle-class homeowners followed the interest rates set by the Japan Housing Finance Agency. Beginning in 2006, the Japan Housing Finance Agency\u2019s interest rate gradually rose, but other private finance agencies continued to provide long-term housing loans at lower rates. Thus, potential homeowners were easily able to purchase a home by selecting one of these long-term, low-interest loans (Kubo 2014).",

Since the 1960s, the Japanese government has promoted rebuilding and providing parks and wide roads for disaster prevention, and deregulating the floor\u2013space ratio was the simplest way to achieve this. The Total Design System of 1970, for example, specified that a floor\u2013space ratio bonus would be provided for development plans involving a certain amount of vacant land. After 1990, the Japanese government accelerated these deregulation processes, including the relaxation of floor\u2013space ratios, enabling the construction of super high-rise buildings in central Tokyo. Currently, developers can apply for floor\u2013space ratio bonuses if their projects include vacant public spaces that can serve as evacuation sites during emergencies. As mentioned above, the population in central Tokyo declined through the early 1990s. However, the deregulation of the floor\u2013space ratio facilitated the construction of super high-rise residential buildings, enabling potential homeowners to purchase condominiums and increasing the popularity of living in the city center. As a result, population recovery was seen in central Tokyo from the beginning of the twenty-first century.",

Opening a new airport became an urgent priority for the government, which took political action to obtain land through eminent domain for the construction of a new airport in 1970.

To supply this type of housing to the growing middle class, suburban development expanded beyond prefectural boundaries, reaching a 100 km commuter belt at the peak of suburbanization and integrating prefectural centers such as Mito City into the Tokyo metropolitan area (see also Chap. 10.1007/978-981-15-4202-2_3).

A new airport was established, and the complementary roles played by Haneda and Narita airports supported Tokyo\u2019s growth.

To create a \u201cstrong Tokyo,\u201d entrepreneurial urbanism emerged at the beginning of the twenty-first century, positioning central Tokyo as the clear winner. A focus on urban redevelopment and the consequent population growth in the city center have fueled this trend over the past two decades. In this context, suburban neighborhoods face challenges related to aging populations and increases in vacant housing. Although government intervention is necessary, there are limited possibilities for the outer suburbs in terms of revitalization and growth. The sharp contrast between the growth in the city center and the decline in the suburbs\u2014the divided Tokyo\u2014may become more obvious in the coming decade.",
