The rich and multimodal features of StockTwits data allow us to explore the evolution of sentiment and disagreement within and across investors, sectors, and even industries. We find that the sentiment (disagreement) has a sharp decrease (increase) across all investors with any investment philosophy, horizon, and experience between February 19, 2020, and March 23, 2020, where a historical market high followed by a record drop. Surprisingly, these measures have a sharp reverse toward the end of March. However, the performance of these measures across various sectors is heterogeneous. Financial and healthcare sectors are the most pessimistic and optimistic divisions, respectively.",

Stock-Twits is a microblogging platform in which investors can post their views as a Tweeter type format, e.g., 140 characters. 1 Perhaps more importantly, they also can label their messages with a sentiment which can be bullish, bearish, or leave it unspecified, neutral. Since extracting sentiment from text data is a challenging task, this is an important feature. 2 Besides, they can use \"cashtags\", e.g., $AAPL, to link their message to a particular firm. 3 Using a survey conducted on wealthy retail investors who are clients of Vanguard, Giglio et al. (2020) provide a data-driven analysis of how investor expectations about economic growth and stock market returns changed during the February-March 2020 stock market crash induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. They find that, among others, investor beliefs before and during the COVID-19 crisis in February-March 2020 1 StockTwits was founded in 2008 as a social networking platform for investors on the financial markets.",

Cookson and Niessner (2019) provide an in-depth analysis of the StockTwits data for measuring disagreement and exploring its source. To have reliable and high quality data, they conduct their analysis of messages posted between January 2013 and September 2014. Since then, the number of users, as well as messages, haven exponentially increased. For example, the number of messages posted between December 2019 and March 2020 is about a quarter of their messages. Although we have access to the whole dataset of StockTwits, however, we limit our analysis on posted messages during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2 A major problem in textual analysis is related to the correct interpretation of context in which certain words are used. In other words, it is difficult to evaluate what truly is a positive, neutral, and negative statement. For example, it is not clear how to deal with sarcasm, see Rosenthal et al. (2019) , among others. 3 Detailed information about why do people post messages? and why do their messages represent their view? can be found in Cookson and Niessner (2019) and therein references.",

We refer to this state, which is the last observation in our sample, as the \"recovered\" state of the economy. It is interesting to investigate the disagreement correlation matrix within investors with different investment philosophies, horizons, and experiences at different stages of the economy. The outcome of such an investigation potentially can help to identify the source of disagreement in these states of the economy. Consequently, it can provide good guidance for the designing ongoing economic policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been documented that disagreement, volume, and volatility are highly correlated, especially during a bear market, see Bollerslev et al. (2018) , among others.",

By exploiting the evolution of average sentiment and disagreement across and within sectors, in contrast to our finding across investors, we find that the pattern of sentiment and disagreement is heterogeneous across sectors.

We use all observations in our sample from November 31, 2019, until February 19 (March 23), 2020 for calculating disagreement correlation matrix in the good (bad) state of the economy. In each panel, there are two heatmaps, with (right) and without (left) rolling window. A close inspection reveals three important findings. First, disagreement for growth investors in all three states of the economy is less correlated to investors with other investment philosophies. For example, in the good state of economy growth investors have a negative correlation with fundamental, momentum, and value investors. Second, in the good state of the economy disagreement correlation matrix has smaller values in comparison with the bad sate. For instance, the correlation between momentum and value investors increases from 0.40 to 0.79. Third, although the market gains back some of its losses by the end of March, however, the values of the disagreement correlation matrix are still high. This is consistent with whatwe find earlier, which is the disagreement decreases towards the end of the sample for all investment philosophies. The same results hold for investors' experience and investment horizon.16",

A close inspection of the mean columns reveals two important discoveries. First, on average investors do not post the same number of bullish/bearish messages across sectors. Second, the financial sector is the most pessimistic, with 0.199 average sentiment per day, while healthcare is the most optimistic with 0.808 average sentiment per day during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, the disagreement measure is the highest (lowest) for the financial (healthcare) sector where the average of disagreement is 0.938(0.584) per day.After the financial sector, the consumer goods sector is the second most pessimistic sector where the average sentiment is 0.312.

Specifically, we can see that the time series of sentiment for financial, consumer goods, technology, and services sectors have downward trends while utilities, industrial goods sectors have time series with an upward trend. The trend of sentiment for the healthcare and basic material is almost flat where the sentiment and disagreement for the basic material sector is more volatile than the rest of the sectors.In a good economy state, each asset class or industry moves independently, i.e., there are small price correlations among different classes of assets or sectors. To explore this behavior for sentiment and disagreement, we calculate the disagreement correlation matrix across all sectors on three economy states: good, bad, and recovered.Panel A ofTable 5presents the disagreement correlation matrix in the good state of the economy across sectors. Among others, we can see that disagreement between finance and technology industries is high and positive, 0.667, while the correlation of disagreement between finance and healthcare sectors is small and negative, \u22120.091. in the technology sector is negatively correlated with industrial goods and services sectors. Moreover, disagreement of healthcare is positively correlated with its counterparts in all other sectors, except for the financial sector.Panel B ofTable 5reveals the disagreement correlation matrix in the bad state of the economy across sectors. In this state of the economy, we can see that in contrast to the good state of the economy, the correlation of the healthcare sector is negative with most of the other sectors. The disagreement correlation matrix is pretty stable by going toward end of the sample, see Panel C. Third, the pattern of sentiment and disagreement is homogeneous for investors across and within investment philosophy, horizons, and experiences. Fourth, the pattern of sentiment and disagreement is heterogeneous across sectors. Fifth, the financial sector is the most pessimistic while healthcare is the most optimistic during the COVID-19 pandemic.There are several unexplored and exciting directions for further investigation on the StockTwits dataset. For example, John Maynard Keynes claims that when there is too much activity in the market, e.g., during the crisis, investors/agents trade mostly by looking at each other\u00e2\u0202\u0179s strategies rather than information. Therefore, it would be interesting to explore what kind of investor influences other investors and how he/she dominates the market. To do so, one can use a multivariate time-dependent point process such as Hawkes Processes, seeA\u00eft-Sahalia et al. (2015), among others.",
