Climate 8 change has tended to dominate the headlines, reflecting, in part, the greater complexity of the 9 biodiversity crisis. Biodiversity itself is a difficult concept. Land plants dominate the global 10 biomass and terrestrial arthropods probably dominate in terms of numbers of species, but most of 11 the Tree of Life consists of single-celled eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea. Wild plants provide a 12 huge variety of products and services to people, ranging from those that are species-specific, 13 such as food, medicine, and genetic resources, to many which are partly interchangeable, such as 14 timber and forage for domestic animals, and others which depend on the whole community, but 15 not on individual species, such as regulation of water supply and carbon sequestration. The use 16 of information from remote sensing has encouraged a simplified view of the values of nature's 17 contributions to people, but this does not match the way most people value nature. We can 18 currently estimate the proportion of species threatened by human impacts only for a few well-19 assessed groups, for which it ranges from 14% (birds) to 63% (cycads). Less than 8% of land 20 plants have been assessed, but it has been estimated that 30-44% are threatened, although there 21 are still few (0.2%) well-documented extinctions. Priorities for improving protection of 22 biodiversity include: improving the inventory, with surveys focused on geographical areas and 23 taxonomic groups which are under-collected; expanding the protected area system and its 24 representativeness; controlling overexploitation; managing invasive species; conserving 25 threatened species ex situ; restoring degraded ecosystems; and controlling climate change.",

            "text": "The preamble to the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) affirms that 'that the 36 conservation of biological diversity is a common concern of humankind' and it would be hard to 37 find anyone who disagrees with this statement. Yet we continue to lose biodiversity, locally, 38 regionally, and globally. What is going on? Why is this still happening when apparently nobody 39 wants it to? One possible contributing factor is that the status of biodiversity as a universal 'good 40 thing' has meant that we have not had to think out clearly what exactly we mean by the term, 41 why we need it, what we ourselves lose when biodiversity declines, and-perhaps most 42 importantly-what we are prepared to do to protect it. Contrast the ongoing biodiversity crisis 43 with the climate crisis, where these questions are readily answerable-indeed, quantifiable-and 44 it is easy to see why it is climate change that tends to dominate the headlines and public 45 attention. The aim of this review, therefore, is first to clarify the meaning of the term biodiversity 46 and then to summarize the links between biodiversity and human wellbeing, with a focus on 47 plants, and to assess the major gaps in our current efforts to protect it. Numbers of species-the most widely used metric for biodiversity-are even less certain, 71 but mid-range estimates suggest that animals do much better using this metric, with recent 72 estimates for terrestrial arthropods of around 7 million species (Stork, 2018) , to which can be 73 added a million or so marine arthropods and all the other animals. Fungi are next in terms of 74 species richness, with an estimated 2.2-3.8 million species (Hawksworth and L\u00fccking, 2017) . 75 Perhaps surprisingly, a recent estimate for prokaryotes, based on molecular sequence data, 76 suggests a global total of 'only' 0.8-1.6 million of what could be termed species, with this low 77 total reflecting the fact that most prokaryotes seem to be globally distributed (Louca et al., 2019) .",

Around two million 248 species have been described, out of a total likely to be at least 10 million, so doing this 249 comprehensively is clearly impossible at present. The large number of species still waiting to be 250 described is known as the 'Linnean shortfall', after Carl Linnaeus, the father of modern 251 taxonomy. In practice, therefore, conservation operates on the assumption that the biodiversity 252 we know best-usually plants, birds, and mammals-can act as an indicator and 'umbrella' for 253 the protection of everything else: including most insects, nematodes, protists, archaea, and never-254 isolated bacteria. We do not know how accurate this assumption is, but it is currently the best we 255 can do. Increasing the rate of species discovery and description is therefore a key need for the on species distributions so that we can assess conservation needs and priorities.

The 461 window of opportunity for preventing global warming of 1.5 o C is closing but has not yet closed, 462 and we must rapidly reduce greenhouse emissions and maximize natural sinks (IPCC, 2018). We 463 also need to minimize the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, as we have already had 1 o C 464 of global warming, along with increasing temperature and rainfall extremes, and further warming 465 is inevitable under even the most optimistic scenarios. It may be possible to reduce the impacts 466 in the medium term by minimizing other stresses on wild species, but we also need to provide 467 connectivity across environmental gradients, so species can move to more favorable climates. 468 However, the many edaphic specialists-both plants and animals-may be unable to move 469 (Corlett and Tomlinson, 2020) and many other species will not move fast enough to track 470 favorable conditions (Corlett and Westcott, 2013). Assisted migration may be an option for some 471 of these species, but this needs a lot more research. However, many Aichi targets will certainly not be attained by the 2020 deadline and 487 achievement of the Paris targets is looking increasingly challenging. In preparation for COP26, each country is expected to update and strengthen the 523 commitments to combatting climate change made at the time of the Paris agreement in their 524 'nationally determined contributions' (NDCs). As recognized at the time, these initial 525 commitments were insufficient to meet the goals agreed in Paris in 2015, so the first revision is 526 extremely important. Each country's revision needs to set it on a path to carbon neutrality-net 527 zero emissions-by 2050, or soon after. Most of the initial NDCs focused on power generation 528 and forests, but net zero emissions will also require massive changes in transport, industry, and 529 agriculture. Non-state actors-cities, businesses, investors-must be part of this, setting targets 530 compatible with national and global goals.

In practice, when we think of biodiversity we are usually thinking of 59 the multicellular plants, animals, and fungi that we see around us. Most of the Tree of Life, 60 however, consists of single-celled eukaryotes ('protists'), and bacteria and archaea 61 ('prokaryotes') (Burki et al., 2019). 62 In terms of global biomass, land plants dominate, accounting for about 80% of the total, 63 followed by bacteria (c. 15%), with fungi, archaea, protists, and animals, in that order, making up 64 the remainder (Bar-On et al., 2018). Plants do less well in all other measures of success, 65 however. In terms of numbers of individuals, viruses dominate (c. 10 31 ), if they are considered to 66 be alive, followed by bacteria (10 30 ), archaea (10 29 ), fungi (10 27 ), protists (10 27 ), and animals 67 (10 21 -mostly nematodes) (Bar-on et al., 2018).

They then add in associated 88 protists, fungi, and bacteria, giving a final estimate of 1-6 billion species on Earth. They exclude 89 viruses, so their final total is dominated by bacteria, with fungi, protists, and animals accounting 90 for most of the rest. This estimate, and an even higher one (c. 1 trillion species) based on scaling 91 laws (Locey and Lennon, 2016), depend on debatable assumptions and raise the obvious 92 question of how we have failed to detect this additional diversity with the array of methods now 93 available. 94 However, it would also be a mistake to assume that large numbers of species could not 95 have been overlooked. For example, the diplonemids are a group of heterotrophic marine protists 96 (in the Euglenozoa) which were unknown until 2001 and have since been shown to be diverse 97 and abundant in multiple oceanic niches, making them the most species-rich (>45,000 molecular 98 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)) of currently known marine eukaryotes (Tashyreva et al., 99 2018). Indeed, whole ecosystems were overlooked until recently. The unexpected discovery of 100 the unique ecosystems associated with hydrothermal vents in 1977 transformed our ideas of 101 where and how life can thrive (Thaler and Amon, 2019), and the gradual unveiling of the deep biosphere-the microbes that exist deep below the land surface and the sea floor-continues to 103 cause surprises. Life-mostly bacteria and archaea, but also some eukaryotes-is found in 104 borehole samples to depths of < 5 km below the continents (Magnabosco et al., 2018) and the 105 total global biomass of deep subsurface microbes may exceed that of any other ecosystem except 106 forests. 107 A phylogenetic perspective on global biodiversity gives a different picture again, with the 108 animals, fungi, and land plants contributing only a couple of fairly minor branches to a eukaryote 109 tree dominated by at least eight predominantly unicellular 'supergroups' (Burki et al., 2019), and 110 the eukaryotes, in turn, probably branching within the archaea (Hug et al., 2016).

Food, fiber, and other products could be synthesized from inorganic materials, 124 although it is not clear if humans can function if stripped of their microbiome. Scaling this up to a dirty planet with 7-10 billion people, however, is not imaginable. We would at least need the 126 250 or so domesticated species that currently supply the bulk of our food and plant-based raw 127 materials (Sm\u00fdkal et al., 2018). 128 Do we need wild species as well as domesticates? Wild species are most obviously of 129 value to us when they provide products for human use: so-called provisioning services. For 130 plants, these products include foods, medicines, raw materials (timber, fibers, resins etc.), and 131 energy, as well as genetic resources for plant breeding and biotechnological applications (Corlett, 132 2018). Timber and wood products are the most valuable products from wild plants in the 133 international trade, but firewood is at least as important locally. Moreover, most domesticated 134 animals feed on wild plant species. More plant species are traded regionally (bamboos, rattans, 135 some traditional medicines), and many more harvested and used locally (wild foods, traditional 136 medicines, minor raw materials etc.). 137 Some of these uses, such as firewood and forage for domesticated animals, are relatively 138 unselective, although certain species are preferred. For some other uses, such as many timber 139 products, species are usually partly interchangeable. However, use as a wild-harvested food or 140 medicine tends to be species-specific. At least a third of China's flora is used in traditional 141 medicine by one or more ethnic groups (Jaiswal et al., 2016) and at least 22% of Thailand's flora 142 (Phumthum et al., 2018).

Moreover, new genetic technologies are facilitating 153 the use of more distantly related species in crop improvement and highly resolved phylogenies 154 are making it easier to choose the species most likely to be useful for this. The potential uses of 155 wild species in biotechnology, genomics, and synthetic biology are impossible to predict, but this 156 potential means that species with no current species-specific use could acquire new value in the 157 future. 158 Wild plant communities also provide critical regulating services for people, including 159 regulation of water supply and quality, reduction in flood risk, protection of coastlines, 160 prevention of erosion, protection against dust and sand storms, reduction of air and water 161 pollution, and the regulation of local and global climates (Corlett, 2018). Sequestration of carbon 162 in vegetation and soils offsets some of the carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels 163 (Houghton, 2020), but vegetation also has immediate impacts on local climates through other 164 mechanisms, including changes in evapotranspiration, albedo, and surface roughness (Li et al., 165 2020). Regulating services are relatively easy to quantify, but there is usually no simple 166 relationship between plant diversity and the services provided, with monocultures of suitable 167 species serving a similar role. Where a positive relationship between diversity and an ecological 168 function has been demonstrated, or is expected on theoretical grounds, the relationship usually 169 appears to be asymptotic, so only a small proportion of the species present in diverse 170 communities is needed for maximum service provision (Slade et al., 2019). Diversity may be more important when multiple functions and services are considered together, however, since 172 different species will make different contributions to each service. Also, high plant diversity 173 favors high animal diversity, which can, in turn, increase services, such as pollination and 174 recreational bird watching, which depend on this. 175 Most of the other services provided by wild plants can be loosely grouped under 'cultural 176 services', which include a variety of non-material benefits, from recreation and tourism to 177 aesthetic and spiritual values (Corlett, 2018). Natural and semi-natural landscapes attract tourists, 178 inspire artists, and act as a source of cultural identity for the people who live in them. The 179 religious values of trees and forests are evident in their preservation as sacred sites in numerous 180 cultures across Asia and Africa (Verschuuren and Furuta, 2016). As with regulating services, 181 there is typically no simple relationship between cultural services and biodiversity. In the USA, 182 casual visitors to parks preferred to see an abundance of flowers rather a diversity of them 183 (Graves et al., 2017). However, planted monocultures provide few, if any, cultural benefits. 184 We do not know what proportion of the 400,000 known species of land plants currently 185provide species-specific benefits to people, but it is reasonable to conclude that most of them do 186 not. Many additional species are important, but potentially substitutable, sources of timber, 187 firewood, or forage. Moreover, all species contribute to primary production, nutrient cycling, and 188 the provision of habitat, food, and other requirements of animals, fungi, and other organisms.",

This can be 197 a very useful exercise, but to suggest that this subset of map-able services can represent nature's 198 many contributions to human welfare is misleading. Recent research has emphasized both the 199 importance of understanding the motivations and values that influence public attitudes towards 200 environmental issues, including conservation, and the evidence that people can and do attribute 201 multiple values to the same thing (Ar\u00edas-Ar\u00e9valo et al., 2017). Moreover, these multiple values 202 cannot be reduced to a single dimension, however convenient this might be for analysis. It is 203 sometimes suggested that unless values can be expressed in dollar terms, and thus compared with 204 the economic benefits that would flow from an environmentally damaging development, they 205 will be ignored. But if they just don't fit (e.g. spiritual values) or can only be made to fit by 206 grotesque oversimplification (e.g. aesthetic values), such a comparison is meaningless and, 207 indeed, potentially harmful. 208 A focus on monetary valuation of nature's contributions necessarily emphasizes 209 instrumental values (i.e. the values of wild species and ecosystems as means to an end). This 210 ignores both intrinsic values (the values of wild species and ecosystems as ends in themselves, 211 irrespective of their utility to humans) and relational values (the values derived from interacting 212 with nature in a responsible way), although these non-instrumental values of nature are probably 213 recognized by everyone (Ar\u00edas-Ar\u00e9valo et al., 2017). They cannot be monetarized or 214 commodified, and they cannot be bought, sold, or exchanged, but that does not make them any 215 less real. 216 Despite the limitations of assigning monetary values to ecosystem services, however, 217 natural capital accounting can be a useful complement to traditional financial accounting. 218 Forestry England, for example, produces annual accounts which attempt to summarize all the 219 benefits their forests provide, including carbon sequestration and recreational use whose values 220 greatly exceed those of timber production (Forestry England, 2019). Several known benefits, 221 including flood mitigation and reduction of air pollution, are not yet included in the accounts 222 because they cannot be quantified and given a monetary value, so the estimate of total value is 223 incomplete, but it is still a useful guide for management if the limitations are understood. 224 225 4.

Other than corals, too few invertebrates have been assessed to 230 estimate a global figure for any major group, although some groups, such as land snails (R\u00e9gnier 231 et al., 2015) and freshwater bivalves (Lopes-Lima et al., 2018), have large numbers of threatened 232 species.",

            "text": "species have been a major cause of extinctions on oceanic islands and reduce 372 local biodiversity in many mainland habitats, although they rarely cause mainland extinctions by 373 themselves (Bellard et al., 2016). When an alien species is established in the wild outside its 374 native change it is rarely possible to eliminate it, so control efforts must focus on preventing 375 introduction and establishment. If a species is already established, then some form of ecological 376 triage becomes necessary, with priority given to managing the species which are most harmful.377New ideas, new laws, and new technologies will help in specific cases, but the invasive species 378 problem can only get worse and currently looks to be one of the least tractable of conservation 379 issues.380 5.7 Conserve threatened species ex situ.381 Conservation ex situ (i.e. in captivity) is never the first choice, but it is necessary for species 382 and genetically unique populations which are threatened in situ (i.e. in their natural habitat), and 383 desirable, as back-up, for all species and populations which may be threatened in the future. 384 Current efforts with wild plant species are insufficient and, despite some progress, we are still a 385 long way from achieving the 2020 GSPC (Global Strategy for Plant Conservation) target of 75% 386 of threatened plant species conserved ex situ (Sharrock et al., 2018). Conventional seed banks, in 387 which plant species with desiccation tolerant (orthodox) seeds are dried and stored at -20 o C, have 388 been the backbone of ex situ plant conservation for some time, but their limitations have become 389 increasingly clear in recent years. Not only do an estimated 8% of all plant species, mostly in the 390 humid tropics, have desiccation intolerant (recalcitrant) seeds that die when dried and frozen, but 391 many crop and wild species have seeds with relatively short (i.e. decades, not centuries) life-392 spans in standard storage conditions (Colville and Pritchard, 2019). Cryopreservation, usually in 393 liquid nitrogen, is an alternative, both to extend the lives of short-lived orthodox seeds and to 394 enable the long-term ex situ storage of embryo axes, buds, shoot tips, pollen, and other tissues of 395 species with recalcitrant seeds (Pence et al., 2020). These technologies could and should be used 396 more widely for threatened plant species. 397 Cryopreservation and the supporting technologies are more expensive than traditional seed 398 banks, but much cheaper than maintaining plants in cultivation. The small sizes of the genetic 399 individuals protected in seed banks and cryopreservation facilities, and the low maintenance 400 costs, mean that it is practical to preserve many individuals from each population, and multiple 401 populations separately, and thus retain a large proportion of the wild genetic diversity. Living 402 collections of growing plants, in contrast, tend to be small, particularly for trees. There is a rather 403 similar situation with animals, although the technologies are more complex, and the current 404 coverage of threatened species is much poorer than with plants. Cryopreservation of sperm, eggs, 405 and embryos is widely used with domesticated animals, but is much less common with wild 406 species, although a number of 'frozen zoos' exist currently (Charlton et al., 2018). Traditional 407 'captive breeding' has been important largely for charismatic vertebrates, because it is extremely 408 expensive and requires international collaboration between zoos and other facilities. As with 409 living collections in botanical gardens, the limited population sizes in zoos mean that careful 410 management is required to minimize inbreeding and genetic drift.",

            "text": "resources (money, space, time, skilled people, public support) are limited, so 413 their allocation needs careful planning. A focus on the number of species protected may not 414 provide adequate protection for functional and phylogenetic diversity if spatial patterns of 415 species, functional, and phylogenetic diversity do not coincide. Current indices of functional 416 diversity are based on measurements of the 'functional traits' of species in the community-417 measurable aspects of an organism that can be linked with its ecological role or fitness-and 418 their application in conservation is based on the assumption that species which do not add to the 419 functional diversity of a community are redundant, and thus deserve a lower conservation 420 priority. While this may make sense when the focus is on the loss of particular function, such as 421 pollination or seed dispersal, a general application of functional diversity in conservation would 422 require that the measured traits are adequate proxies for all ecological functions of a species, 423 which is clearly not true. Phylogeny, in contrast, predicts both known and unknown features of 424 organisms which, in turn, correlate with multiple values of biodiversity (Owen et al., 2019). 425 Phylogenetic distinctiveness-the amount of unique evolutionary history-has therefore become 426 a widely accepted criterion for prioritizing conservation effort. The loss of a phylogenetically 427 isolated species represents the loss of an entire branch of the tree of life. The EDGE 428 (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered) program of the Zoological Society of London 429 prioritizes species based on the amount of unique evolutionary history eac h onerepresents 430 (Gumbs et al. 2018). This is then combined with a global endangerment score derived from the 431 IUCN Red Lists to give an EDGE score for each species. EDGE scores have proved particularly 432 useful for identifying and prioritizing little-known species which had previously been 433 overlooked, but the wider application of this approach is currently limited by the need for a 434 robust species-level phylogeny and a near-complete global Red List assessment. 435 5.9 Restore degraded ecosystems 436 Small-scale ecological restoration projects-typically a few hectares or less-have been 437 carried out in many different ecosystems worldwide for several decades with varying degrees of 438 success. Restoration projects can provide additional habitat for threatened species while restoring 439 ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration. Recently, however, there have been calls for 440 a huge expansion in ecological restoration, encompassing millions of square kilometers, in order 441 to meet the needs of both biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. The CBD's 442 Aichi target 15 called for the 'restoration of at least 15% of degraded ecosystems' by 2020 and a 443 recent study estimated that at least 1.9 million km 2 of land in 114 countries will need to be 444 restored to meet the area component of Aichi target 11 (Mappin et al., 2019). A global forest 445 restoration effort, the Bonn Challenge, called for 1.5 million km 2 of land to be committed to 446 restoration by 2020 and 3.5 million km 2 by 2030. Most countries also include huge reforestation 447 commitments in their 'nationally determined contributions' (NDCs) to meeting the climate 448 change mitigation targets of the Paris agreement. It is not just the vast areas proposed that are 449 challenging, but also the range of ecosystems involved and the potential for trade-offs between 450 the twin motivations of carbon and biodiversity (considered below).451 5.10 Control pollution 452Even the best fences do not keep out air and water pollution from protected areas. Ozone, 453 sulfur dioxide, and particulates are problems for terrestrial ecosystems in some areas, but the 454 greatest concern globally is deposition of reactive nitrogen produced from fossil fuels and455 intensive agriculture. Increases in nitrogen deposition impact plant communities through direct 456 toxicity, soil acidification, nutrient imbalances, and changes in interspecific competition (Payne 457 et al., 2017). Impacts can occur at low levels and are easily overlooked. 458 459 5.11 Stop climate change and minimize the impacts on biodiversity460",

This starting date coincides with the 'Great Acceleration' in population 476 growth, industrialization, globalization, and all their consequences (Steffen et al., 2015). Both 477 biodiversity loss and climate change started well before this date, but it was this post-1950 478 acceleration in the major drivers of both which produced the twin crises we face today. Climate 479 change and biodiversity loss are often treated separately, but they are interconnected in many 480 ways, including sharing multiple drivers (Seddon et al., 2019). We cannot solve one crisis 481 without addressing the other. This interdependence is recognized in the most recent reports of 482 both the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change) and its biodiversity equivalent 483 IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) 484 (IPCC, 2018; IPBES, 2019).

These solutions include the restoration of natural forests, grasslands, and wetlands in 491 order to store carbon and protect biodiversity, as well as urban greening through parks and green 492 roofs. The costs and benefits of these approaches have rarely been rigorously assessed, and there493 are potential conflicts between carbon and biodiversity if, for example, ancient natural grasslands 494 are planted with exotic tree monocultures (Bond et al., 2019). The potential benefits are large, 495 but there are also substantial risks and trade-offs (Doelman et al., 2020), and it is essential to 496 build-in adequate safeguards to prevent unintended consequences (Veldman et al., 2019). This is 497 another area where research is urgently needed, as well as modeling studies and largeand COP26: what needs to happen? 501 We are in a critical period for global progress on both biodiversity conservation and 502 climate change mitigation. Currently, positive trends in both arenas, such as the increase in 503 protected area coverage and the expansion of renewable sources of energy, are being 504 overwhelmed by continuing negative trends, in habitat and species losses, and in global 505 greenhouse gas emissions. We need to turn these negative trends around and 2021 will provide 506 two unique opportunities for doing this. The parties to the Convention on Biodiversity will meet 507 in Kunming, China, for the 15 th Conference of Parties (COP15) and the signatories to the Paris 508 Agreement on climate change will meet in Glasgow, U.K., for the 26th Conference of Parties 509 (COP26) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Both meetings have 510 been postponed from 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic and it is essential that 511 momentum is not lost as a consequence. 512 COP15 must agree on a post-2020 global biodiversity framework to replace the Strategic 513 Plan for Biodiversity (including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets) for the 2011-2020 period, agreed 514 in Nagoya in 2010. The new targets for 2030 need to be clear, ambitious, inspirational, and 515 measurable. A protected area target of 30% by 2030 would be achievable in most countries, with 516 the inclusion of OECMs, but a percentage target risks directing attention away from the need for 517 effective management of high-value sites and will have to be worded very carefully (Visconti et 518 al., 2019). At the species level, the only reasonable goal is zero extinction, which is already the 519 implied or explicit target for conservation in most countries and should be the global target. The 520 development of the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems also makes an ecosystem target possible and, 521 unlike species targets, potentially possible to monitor with remote sensing (Watson et al., 2020).",
