            "text": "\nThere has been considerable recent interest into the causes and mechanisms of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as COPD exacerbations are an important cause of the considerable morbidity and mortality found in COPD [1]. COPD exacerbations increase with increasing severity of COPD. Some patients are prone to frequent exacerbations that are an important cause of hospital admission and readmission, and these frequent exacerbations may have considerable impact on quality of life, disease progression, and mortality [2] (Fig. 67.1\n). COPD exacerbations are also associated with considerable physiological deterioration and increased airway inflammatory changes [3] that are caused by a variety of factors such as viruses, bacteria, and possibly common pollutants. COPD exacerbations are commoner in the winter months and there may be important interactions between cold temperatures and exacerbations caused by viruses or pollutants [4].",

            "text": "Earlier descriptions of COPD exacerbations had concentrated mainly on studies of hospital admission, though most COPD exacerbations are treated in the community and not associated with hospital admission. A cohort of moderate-to-severe COPD patients was followed in East London, UK (East London COPD study) with daily diary cards and peak flow readings, who were asked to report exacerbations as soon as possible after symptomatic onset [2]. The diagnosis of COPD exacerbation was based on criteria modified from those described by Anthonisen and colleagues [5], which require two symptoms for diagnosis, one of which must be a major symptom of increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence. Minor exacerbation symptoms included cough, wheeze, sore throat, nasal discharge, or fever (Table 67.1\n). The study found that about 50% of exacerbations were unreported to the research team, despite considerable encouragement provided and only diagnosed from diary cards. But there were no differences in major symptoms or physiological parameters between reported and unreported exacerbations [2]. Patients with COPD are accustomed to frequent symptom changes and thus may tend to underreport exacerbations to physicians. These patients have high levels of anxiety and depression and may accept their situation 6., 7.. The tendency of patients to underreport exacerbations may explain the higher total rate of exacerbation at 2.7 per patient per year, which is higher than that of previously reported by Anthonisen and co-workers at 1.1 per patient per year [5]. However in the latter study, exacerbations were unreported and diagnosed from patients\u2019 recall of symptoms.",

Quality of life scores measured using a validated disease-specific scale, the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), was significantly worse in all of its three component scores (symptoms, activities, and impacts) in the frequent, compared to the infrequent exacerbators. This suggests that exacerbation frequency is an important determinant of health status in COPD and is thus one of the important outcome measures in COPD. Factors predictive of frequent exacerbations included daily cough and sputum and frequent exacerbations in the previous year. A previous study of acute infective exacerbations of chronic bronchitis found that one of the factors predicting exacerbation was also the number in the previous year [8], though this study was limited to exacerbations presenting with purulent sputum and no physiological data was available during the study.",

Falls in peak expiratory flow and FEV1 at exacerbation were generally small and not useful in predicting exacerbations, but larger falls in peak expiratory flow were associated with symptoms of dyspnoea, \u00adpresence of colds, and longer recovery time from exacerbations. Symptoms of dyspnoea, common colds, sore throat, and cough increased significantly during the prodromal phase, and this suggests that respiratory viruses may have early effects at exacerbations. The median time to recovery of peak expiratory flow was 6 days and 7 days for symptoms, but at 35 days peak expiratory flow had returned to normal in only 75% of exacerbations, while at 91 days, 7.1% of exacerbations had not returned to baseline lung function. Recovery was longer in the presence of increased dyspnoea or symptoms of a common cold at exacerbation. The changes observed in lung function at exacerbation were smaller than those observed at asthmatic exacerbations, though the average duration of an asthmatic exacerbation was longer at 9.6 days 10., 11..",

The incomplete physiological recovery after an exacerbation could contribute to the decline in lung function with time in patients with COPD. However to date, there is no evidence that patients with incomplete recovery of their exacerbation have a greater decline in lung function, and further studies on the natural history of COPD exacerbations are required. A recent audit performed by the Royal College of Physicians, London, showed that \ue02c30% of patients seen at hospital with an index exacerbation will be seen again and possibly readmitted with a recurrent exacerbation within 8 weeks [12]. In a cohort of moderate-to-severe COPD patients 22% of patients had a recurrent exacerbation within 50 days of the first (index) exacerbation, and this event can be separated discretely from the index exacerbation [13]. Thus, exacerbations are complex events and careful follow-up is essential to ensure complete recovery.",

COPD exacerbations are frequently triggered by upper respiratory tract infections [19], and these are commoner in the winter months, when there are more respiratory viral infections in the community. Patients may also be more prone to exacerbations in the winter months as lung function in COPD patients shows small but significant falls with reduction in outdoor temperature during the winter months [4]. COPD patients have been found to have increased hospital admissions, suggesting increased exacerbation when increasing environmental pollution occurs. During the December 1991 pollution episode in the UK, COPD mortality was increased together with an increase in hospital admission in elderly COPD patients [20]. However, common pollutants especially oxides of nitrogen and particulates may interact with viral infection to precipitate exacerbation rather than acting alone [21].",

Studies have shown that at least one-third of COPD exacerbations were associated with viral infections, and that the majority of these were due to human rhinovirus, the cause of the common cold 19., 22., 23.. Viral exacerbations were associated with symptomatic colds and prolonged recovery of the exacerbation [9]. Using molecular techniques, Seemungal and colleagues also showed that rhinovirus can be recovered from induced sputum more frequently than from nasal aspirates at exacerbation, suggesting that wild-type rhinovirus can infect the lower airway and contribute to inflammatory changes at exacerbation [22]. They also found that exacerbations associated with the presence of rhinovirus in induced sputum had larger increases in airway IL-6 levels [22], suggesting that viruses increase the severity of airway inflammation at exacerbation. This finding is in agreement with the data that respiratory viruses produce longer and more severe exacerbations and have a major impact on health care utilization 9., 24.. Other viruses may trigger COPD exacerbation, though coronavirus was associated with only a small proportion of asthmatic exacerbations and is unlikely to play a major role in COPD [25]. RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus can all trigger exacerbations. Influenza has become a less prominent cause of exacerbation with the introduction of immunization, though this is still likely to be an important factor at times of influenza epidemics. RSV infection has been found at COPD exacerbation [26], but it is not clear if RSV is a cause of COPD exacerbation as RSV can be frequently detected in the airways of COPD patients when stable [27].",

            "text": "Over the past years, the role of bacterial infection at COPD exacerbation has been somewhat controversial as airway bacterial colonization is found when patients are stable state and the same organisms are isolated exacerbations. These include Haemophilus Influenzae, Streptococcus Pneumoniae, Branhamella cattarhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n[28]. In a study in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, bacteria were found in 48.2% of patients in the stable state and at exacerbation, bacterial detection rose to 69.6%, with an associated rise in airway bacterial load [29]. The case for involvement of bacteria has come from the studies of antibiotic therapy as exacerbations often present with increased sputum purulence and volume and antibiotics have traditionally been used as first-line therapy in such exacerbations. Anthonisen and colleagues in a classical paper investigating the benefit of antibiotics in over 300 acute exacerbations demonstrated a greater treatment success rate in patients treated with antibiotics, especially if their initial presentation was with the symptoms of increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, and purulence [5]. Patients with mild COPD obtained less benefit from antibiotic therapy. A meta-analysis of trials of antibiotic therapy in COPD has concluded that antibiotic therapy offered a small but significant benefit in outcome in exacerbations [30]. Sethi and colleagues have suggested that isolation of a new bacterial strain in COPD patients who were regularly sampled was associated with an increased risk of exacerbation [31], though this also does not conclusively prove that bacteria are direct causes of exacerbations as not all exacerbations were associated with strain change, and not all strain changes resulted in exacerbation.",

This has been confirmed in a further study demonstrating greater lung function impairment and longer hospitalizatons in exacerbations associated with viral and bacterial co-infection [32]. It has also been suggested that atypical micro-organisms such as chlamydia and mycoplasma may cause COPD exacerbations, though evidence on their role is conflicting and these infective agents may interact with other bacteria and viruses in the airways 33., 34..",

The airflow obstruction leads to hyperinflation, with the respiratory muscles acting at a mechanical disadvantage and generating reduced inspiratory pressures. The load on the respiratory muscles is also increased in patients with airflow obstruction by the presence of intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). With an exacerbation of COPD, the increase in airflow obstruction will further increase the load on the respiratory muscles and increase the work of breathing, precipitating respiratory failure in more severe cases. The minute ventilation may be normal, but the respiratory pattern will be irregular with increased frequency and decreased tidal volume. The resultant hypercapnia and acidosis will then reduce inspiratory muscle function, contributing to further deterioration of the respiratory failure.",

In patients with stable COPD, symptomatic benefit can be obtained with bronchodilator therapy in COPD, even without significant changes in spirometry. This is probably due to a reduction in dynamic hyperinflation that is characteristic of COPD and hence leads to a decrease in the sensation of dyspnoea especially during exertion [35]. In stable COPD greater bronchodilatation has been demonstrated with anti-cholinergic agents than with \u03b22 agonists, which may be due to the excessive cholinergic neuronal bronchoconstrictor tone [36]. However, studies investigating bronchodilator responses in acute exacerbations of COPD have shown no differences between agents used and no significant additive effect of the combination therapy, even though combination of anticholinergic and bronchodilator has benefits in the stable state 37., 38.. This difference in effect between the acute and stable states may be due to the fact that the larger doses of drug delivered in the acute setting produce maximal bronchodilatation, whereas the smaller doses administered in the stable condition may be having a sub-maximal effect.",

However, the rate of peak expiratory flow recovery was faster in the prednisolone-treated group, though not the rate of symptom score recovery. An interesting finding in this study was that steroids significantly prolonged the median time from the day of onset of the initial exacerbation to the next exacerbation from 60 days in the group not treated with prednisolone to 84 days in the patients treated with prednisolone. In contrast, antibiotic therapy had no effect on the time to the next exacerbation.

In contrast, Niewoehner and colleagues performed a detailed evaluation of steroid complications and found considerable evidence of hyperglycaemia in the steroid-treated patients. Thus, steroids should be used at COPD exacerbation in short courses of no more than 2 weeks duration to avoid risk of complications.",

A small study comparing doxapram with non-invasive ventilation (NPPV) in acute exacerbations of COPD suggested that NPPV was superior with regard to correction of blood gases during the initial treatment phase [53].

A study from the United States showed a significant reduction in intubation rates with NIPPV from 67% in a group receiving conventional therapy to 9% in the NIPPV group [55]. A third study showed convincingly that in patients with exacerbations of respiratory failure, the use of NIPPV with pressure supports ventilation, reduces the need for intubation and mortality is significantly reduced from 29% in the conventionally treated group to 9% in the NIPPV group [56]. Complications, which were specifically associated with the use of mechanical ventilation, were also reduced. The difference in mortality disappeared after adjustment for intubation, suggesting that the benefits with NIPPV are due to fewer patients requiring intubation. This was also the first study to show that hospital length of stay can be reduced with use of NIPPV. A recent study showed that NPPV can be applied on general wards, though patients with more severe acidosis had a worse outcome [57].",

A direct comparison of inhaled tiotropium with the salmeterol/fluticasone (SFC) combination in the recently reported INSPIRE studyin moderate-to-severe COPD patients showed that both interventions had an equal effect on exacerbation rates [71].

The triple combination reduced hospitalization as a result of exacerbation, but not the total number of exacerbations. In addition a trend was observed in the reduction of the number of exacerbations with the triple combination, which did not reach statistical significance due to the relatively small size of the study and the high dropout rate. Triple therapy may be more effective than other therapies and further studies of these combinations are now required with adequately powered studies.",
