At Prince of Wales Hospital, a 1350-bed teaching hospital in Hong Kong, the first wave of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection affected close to 80% of the staff on the medical ward. Within the first 2 weeks of this outbreak, which began on 10 March 2003, 69 HCWs were admitted for probable or suspected SARS [3]. Isolation wards for probable and suspected SARS cases were established, and infection-control measures involving droplet precautions was implemented [4].",

This assay has been used to confirm the diagnosis of SARS in patients with antibody titers of 80\u20135120 twenty-one days after the onset of symptoms [7].

For patients with a titer of \u2a7e40, a second serum sample and all previously obtained serum samples were also examined for SARS-CoV IgG. All HCWs with SARS had titers of \u2a7e160 in this study.",

The 3 HCWs with IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV claimed to have complied with infection-control precautions by wearing masks and gloves; possible violations of infection-control measures during their work practice was not identified in retrospective evaluation. Two of the 3 HCWs worked during the entire 10-week outbreak period, suggesting prolonged exposure in the SARS wards. A literature search revealed 1 case report of a nurse who was found to have asymptomatic SARS-CoV antibody seroconversion during screening involving 101 HCWs at another major infectious diseases hospital [8]. A seroprevalence study of SARS-CoV conducted by the Guangdong Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangdong, People's Republic of China) indicated a prevalence of 2.9% among hospital workers (4 of 137) in 2 Guangdong city hospitals [9].

Among all HCWs who were infected with SARS-CoV in Hong Kong, nurses accounted for 55% of the cases, followed by 27% for support staff and 15% for doctors [10]. In an infection-control program for the prevention of SARS, health care occupations associated with the highest risk for SARS must be emphasized\u2014perhaps through educational activities or investigation of the procedures commonly performed by HCWs in such occupations\u2014to modify practice such that the risk of exposure is minimized. In addition, guidelines and isolation precautions must be adopted and complied with [5] to control SARS. Preliminary data suggest that only a few HCWs will develop subclinical or mild infections due to SARS-CoV. Whether this is an infective dose-dependent phenomenon or a factor of the host remains to be determined.",
