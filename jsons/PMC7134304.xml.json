This study is a part of a broader research stream exploring the role of technology in innovation. Here, we seek to address the following research questions: (1) How does IT contribute to innovation in fintech? and (2) What types of IT-enabled innovations are likely to disrupt existing financial services? To address these questions, we focus on the leading startups in the NYC fintech ecosystem based on the funds raised from investors in the past 5 years and we examine how IT contributes to the value creation within each product or service offering. We also evaluate the likely disruptive impact of the IT-enabled innovations.",

            "text": "Fintech is a rapidly growing area of practice that is expected to reach $300 billion in revenues by 2023 [27], yet relatively little is known about how fintech startups leverage technology for innovation. To address this gap in research, we examined the leading startups in the New York City fintech ecosystem that have collectively raised over $1.1 billion in funding. We drew on the business model canvas framework and we examined how the startups leverage technology across their business model components. We find that technology platforms form the core of the innovative service offerings developed by the startups in our dataset. Further, we find that startups use low-price offering as the dominant strategy for disrupting the existing financial services markets. These observations provide empirical support for the theoretical arguments that call for the reexamination of the organizational logics underlying technology-driven innovation [36].",
