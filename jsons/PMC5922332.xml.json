We included those cases with typical clinical symptoms consistent with respiratory infection (dyspnoea, cough, sputum production, fever [temperature \u226538\u00b0C]) and evidence of new radiographic shadowing within 48 hours of admission to hospital that was not known to be due to other causes. Patients with a previous hospital admission within 14 days and those admitted from nursing homes were excluded. To address issues with information bias, case notes review was carried out by the authors (AM, RJ, BA) and the information cross-referenced with that in the ICU database and radiology database. All chest radiographs were reviewed by the requesting clinician and usually reported within 48 hours by a consultant radiologist.

Immune dysfunction, previous antibiotic therapy and prior hospitalisations may increase the risk of infection with resistant or more difficult pathogens in cancer patients. However, in our cohort pneumonia due to resistant or difficult to treat organisms was rare. Recently, it has been shown that patients with cancer that develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have lower survival rates (55.2% vs 24.3%) [10]. However, in this study patients with cancer did not have significantly worse severity of lung injury (with similar P/F ratios), and the requirement for and duration of mechanical ventilation did not differ to patients without cancer. Instead, in our cohort, the poor survival of cancer patients with CAP was associated with an increased illness severity at the time of ICU admission with 5, 8 and 3 point differences in median APACHE II, SAPS II and SOFA scores, respectively. In addition, there was an increased requirement for vasopressors and a lower diastolic blood pressure on admission in the patients with cancer, suggesting that this group had an increased incidence of septic shock. Although the survival of cancer patients with septic shock has previously been reported to not be too dissimilar from mixed populations with septic shock [11], an increased prevalence of septic shock would be expected to translate into increased mortality. Our findings are similar to published data on non-CAP critically ill patients with cancer that also show an increased incidence of septic shock [12\u201314].",

In our cohort, CAP patients with cancer were admitted to the ICU on average a day later following hospital admission compared to those without cancer (IQR 1\u20135 vs 0\u20133 days). These data suggest one potential reason for the increased illness severity and septic shock at the time of admission to ICU for cancer patients with CAP could be delayed transfer to ICU, either due to failure to recognise illness severity or perhaps because of a reluctance to involve ICU in patients with known cancer. Improved recognition of severe sepsis and an early decision for intensive care management may potentially improve the outcome of this patient group.",

            "text": "In conclusion, compared to non-cancer patients, cancer patients with CAP have a lower diastolic blood pressure, and increased illness severity scores and requirement for vasopressor support at the time of ICU admission, and a higher risk of death. These results suggest the increased mortality of CAP in patients with cancer could be partially due to a delay in recognising the need for intensive care support in cancer patients compared to non-cancer patients.",
