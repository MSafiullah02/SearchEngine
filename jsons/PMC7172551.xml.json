            "text": "The synthesis of subgenomic messenger RNAs (sgRNAs) is a common strategy employed by positive-sense RNA viruses to mediate expression and regulation of 3\u2032 proximal open reading frames (ORFs) on multicistronic genomic RNAs. Three general mechanisms have been proposed for sgRNA synthesis Choi and White 2002, White 2002. The most commonly accepted mechanism, internal initiation from negative-sense RNA templates (Miller et al., 1985), appears to be operating during sgRNA synthesis by the Bromoviruses\nSiegel et al 1997, Siegel et al 1998, Alfamoviruses\n(Van Der Kuyl et al., 1990), Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) (Wang and Simon, 1997), and several other viruses (Miller and Koev, 2000). In contrast, a discontinuous mechanism of transcription that produces sgRNAs with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sequences identical to the genomic RNAs has been reported for the large Coronaviruses\n(Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998) and Arterioviruses\n(Pasternak et al., 2001). These sgRNAs arise from minus-strand subgenomic templates produced via polymerase jumping during transcription from genomic RNA templates. A third mechanism, premature termination, has been reported for Flock house virus (FHV) (Zhong and Ruekert, 1993; Lindenbach et al., 2000), Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) (Sit et al., 1998), and Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) (reviewed by White, 2002). In these cases, truncated negative-sense RNAs that had been generated by premature termination at regions of secondary structure of genomic RNA are postulated to serve as templates for the positive-sense sgRNAs. In the case of FHV and TBSV, cis-acting sequences within the genomic RNA are postulated to mediate long distance interactions that contribute to premature polymerase termination during transcription of the negative-sense templates (White, 2002), whereas in the case of RCNMV, termination during transcription from the RNA 1 template requires base pairing of trans-activator sequences residing on RNA 2 with trans-activator binding sequences on RNA 1 (Sit et al., 1998). Other less well-defined examples of premature termination appear to occur during synthesis of two classes of 5\u2032 coterminal sgRNAs appearing in Citrus tristiza virus (CTV) infected plants (Che et al., 2001). Although the possible functions of the CTV sgRNAs have not been resolved, the synthesis of the two species appears to be regulated because they exhibit some differences in the timing of their appearance and they are the earliest and the most abundant sgRNAs synthesized.",

            "text": "The core sgRNA promoters have been mapped and characterized in a variety of plant RNA viruses that synthesize either single or multiple sgRNAs (Miller and Koev, 2000). These promoters range in size from less than 30 nucleotides (nt) Johnston and Rochon 1995, Wang et al 1999 to nearly 150 nt Van Der Vossen et al 1995, Koev and Miller 2000, and they normally reside upstream of, or encompass only a few nucleotides downstream of, the transcription initiation site. However, a few promoters include substantial regions downstream of the transcription initiation site Balmori et al 1993, Koev and Miller 2000. For example, the Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) RNA3 sgRNA promoter occupies more than 100 nt downstream of the transcription start site (Balmori et al., 1993) and the Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) sgRNA2 promoter resides entirely within the sgRNA. In addition to this complexity and variation among RNA viruses, long distance interactions have also been noted in several viruses (Miller and Keov, 2000). In the case of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) contains three pseudoknot structures whose ectopic placement appears to redistribute polymerase activity to the closest upstream sgRNA promoter (Shivprasad et al., 1999). In contrast, optimal activity of the TBSV sgRNA2 promoter requires long distance cis interactions with complementary upstream sequences separated by more than 1000 nt Zhang et al 1999, Choi and White 2002.",

In one well-studied case, the BYDV sgRNA1 promoter has been mapped from \u221275 to +21 relative to its transcription initiation site, while the sgRNA2 and sgRNA3 promoters map between positions +1 and +143, and \u22126 and +38, respectively (Koev and Miller, 2000). Thus, the BYDV sgRNA1 and sgRNA3 promoters occupy sequences that overlap the transcription initiation site, whereas the sgRNA2 promoter resides entirely within the sgRNA transcript. Aside from a conserved hexanucleotide shared between the sgRNA1 and sgRNA2 promoters, little or no similarity exists between the three promoters.

BSMV is a Hordeivirus whose genome is divided into three positive-sense, single-stranded RNAs, designated \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 (Fig. 1). The \u03b1 and \u03b3 RNAs are required for replication, while RNA\u03b2 is essential for cell-to-cell movement. The replicase proteins \u03b1a and \u03b3a are translated directly from their respective genomic RNAs (Petty et al., 1990). In addition, RNA\u03b3 also encodes a small cysteine-rich protein, designated \u03b3b, that is translated from sgRNA\u03b3 and is dispensable for BSMV replication. The coat protein, \u03b2a, is translated directly from RNA\u03b2 and, following an intergenic region, the overlapping viral movement genes are arranged in a \u201ctriple gene block\u201d (TGB). The three major TGB proteins (TGB1, 2, and 3) and one minor protein, TGB2\u2032, are translated from two sgRNAs, designated sgRNA\u03b21 and sgRNA\u03b22. The TGB1 protein is expressed from sgRNA\u03b21, while the other overlapping proteins TGB2, TGB2\u2032, and TGB3 are translated from sgRNA\u03b22 (Zhou and Jackson, 1996b). The TGB2\u2032 protein is a translational readthrough product of the TGB2 ORF, and the TGB3 protein is translated by leaky scanning of the TGB2 start codon (Zhou and Jackson, 1996b). The transcription initiation sites of the three BSMV sgRNAs have been mapped and their relative abundance has been determined Gustafson et al 1987, Zhou and Jackson 1996b. Northern blot analyses of nucleic acids extracted from BSMV-infected protoplasts have demonstrated that sgRNA\u03b3 and sgRNA\u03b21 accumulate to high levels, whereas sgRNA\u03b22 is present in much lower abundance Zhou and Jackson 1996a, Zhou and Jackson 1996b. Limited evidence from protoplasts also indicates that sgRNA\u03b21 and \u03b22 expression is regulated temporally and that sgRNA\u03b3 is expressed constitutively (Zhou and Jackson, 1996b).",

The three BSMV sgRNA promoters have also been repositioned into \u03b2 and \u03b3 RNAs that either contain or lack the native promoters. The results indicate that the analogous BSMV sgRNA promoters have some sequence similarity to predicted promoter regions of other Hordeiviruses. Nevertheless, the three sgRNA promoters do not share extensive sequence similarity, nor are recognizable common structural elements evident. Although the BSMV core promoter sequences failed to function when inserted ectopically into RNA\u03b2 and RNA\u03b3, core promoters introduced with additional flanking sequences were active, but this activity was dependent on the context into which the sequences were inserted.",

This site resides within the 42-nt intergenic region between the \u03b3a and \u03b3b ORFs (Fig. 1). To analyze the sgRNA\u03b3 promoter, BY-2 protoplasts were transfected with in vitro transcripts, and the RNAs synthesized during infection were evaluated by Northern blot analyses. Because the \u03b3a stop codon is located 18 nt upstream of the sgRNA\u03b3 transcriptional start site, we predicted that the sgRNA\u03b3 promoter would overlap the \u03b3a ORF. The \u03b3a protein encodes the viral polymerase and hence is essential for viral replication. Therefore, engineering deletions to map the sgRNA\u03b3 promoter could have interfered with the \u03b3a ORF and might have affected replication. To circumvent this problem, protoplasts were transfected with two RNA\u03b3 derivatives. One RNA, \u03b3KpnI/HpaI, provided a source of the \u03b3a replicase protein and also contained a 350-nt deletion (from positions 2112 to 2461 on RNA\u03b3) to remove the majority of the \u03b3b ORF, and a second derivative designed to assess promoter activity contained deletions engineered within the putative sgRNA\u03b3 promoter (Fig. 2A). The deletion present in \u03b3KpnI/HpaI RNA allowed us to distinguish between the two RNA\u03b3 derivatives based on their sizes. Protoplasts were transfected with RNA\u03b1, RNA\u03b3, and RNA\u03b3KpnI/HpaI, and nucleic acid was extracted from protoplasts at 20 h posttransfection. Each of the three RNAs replicated to wild-type (wt) levels in protoplasts and synthesized the predicted sgRNAs (data not shown). Therefore, in subsequent mapping experiments, protoplasts were transfected with RNA\u03b1, RNA\u03b3KpnI/HpaI, and an RNA\u03b3 derivative that contained a deletion within the putative sgRNA\u03b3 promoter.",

One contained a large-scale deletion in the \u03b3a ORF from nt 593 to 1899 and the other had a smaller deletion from positions 2111 to 2262 in the \u03b3b ORF. When these RNAs were transfected individually into protoplasts along with RNA\u03b1 and RNA\u03b3KpnI/HpaI, both of the deletion derivatives were able to replicate and synthesize sgRNA\u03b3 at levels comparable to wt RNA\u03b3 (data not shown). These results indicate that the deleted regions are not required for sgRNA\u03b3 synthesis and that they do not contain regulatory elements that affect replication. Therefore, a more refined analysis of the sgRNA\u03b3 promoter was initiated by evaluation of deletions beginning at position \u2212152 (position 1902 on RNA\u03b3) and extending to positions \u2212119, \u221278, \u221238, and \u221218 upstream of the transcription start site. Two additional deletions beginning at position +57 and extending to +27 and +11 were also generated. To specifically visualize the replication of these RNA\u03b3 derivatives and the presence of sgRNA\u03b3, a 32P-labeled riboprobe was used that is complementary to the KpnI/HpaI region that had been eliminated in the \u03b3KpnI/HpaI RNA used to mediate replication of the test RNAs. This probe thus recognizes only the RNA\u03b3 and sgRNA\u03b3 derivatives designed to assess promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, Northern blot analysis revealed that each of the RNA\u03b3 test derivatives were able to replicate in trans and that the \u03b3RNAs containing the deletions \u2212152/\u2212119, \u2212152/\u221278, \u2212152/\u221238, +57/+27, and +57/+11 were able to synthesize sgRNA\u03b3. However, when the region between \u2212152 and \u221218 was deleted, sgRNA synthesis was not evident.

Our interpretation of these results is that the C at position \u221222 is dispensable for sgRNA\u03b3 synthesis, but that the A at position \u221221 is required for promoter activity. The RNAs used for deletion analysis starting at position +10 were all able to replicate, but only the +10 to +4 or +3 deletions were able to synthesize sgRNA\u03b3 (Fig. 2B). When the next residue at +2 was deleted, sgRNA\u03b3 was not evident, and hence, the A at position +2 is required for sgRNA\u03b3 synthesis, whereas the A at +3 is dispensable. Therefore, these results indicate that the sgRNA\u03b3 promoter boundaries map to positions \u221221 and +2 relative to the sgRNA\u03b3 transcription start site.

In addition, we had identified a cis-acting element required for RNA\u03b2 replication within this intergenic region (Zhou and Jackson, 1996a).

To circumvent this problem, we constructed mutations in a cDNA clone that contained a 1427-nt deletion (\u03b2S/B) which removed the majority of the TGB ORFs. This deletion did not affect RNA\u03b2 replication, in agreement with our previous results (Zhou and Jackson, 1996a) and also clearly resolved sgRNA\u03b21 and the rRNAs to permit detection of sgRNA\u03b21 (data not shown). It is important to note that the \u03b2S/B RNA deletion also eliminated the sgRNA\u03b22 promoter to mitigate possible competition effects that might have affected synthesis of sgRNA\u03b21. To define the starting points for mapping the sgRNA\u03b21 promoter, we used two RNA\u03b2 derivatives. One of these, \u03b2\u03941.6, contained a deletion from position 295 to 633, and the other, \u03b2\u03942.0, eliminated nts 802 to 1375 on the genomic RNA sequence. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from protoplasts transfected with the \u03b1 and \u03b3 RNAs and the \u03b2\u03941.6 or \u03b2\u03942.0 RNAs indicated that the deletions had no discernable effect on sgRNA\u03b21 synthesis (data not shown).

To further resolve the nature of the active sgRNA promoter element, we engineered smaller deletions from positions \u221230 to +14. As shown in Fig. 3C, when the A residue at \u221230 was deleted, sgRNA\u03b21 was evident, but deletion of the adjacent U at \u221229 effectively eliminated promoter activity without obvious effects on replication of the genomic RNAs. In contrast, deletions that spanned +14/+2, +14/+1, and +14/\u22121 retained promoter activity (Fig. 3C). However, when the next residue, a U at \u22122, was deleted, promoter activity was disrupted. These results suggest that the core promoter sequence required for sgRNA\u03b21 synthesis resides immediately upstream of the sgRNA\u03b21 transcription start site between positions \u221229 and \u22122. However, an alternative possibility that needs further exploration is that the +14/+1 deletion could have generated an alternative transcription initiation site at the upstream C residue. Similar alternative sites have previously been identified in in vitro studies with the Brome mosaic virus sgRNA promoter (Stawicki and Kao, 1999).",

Since sgRNA\u03b22 is expressed at very low levels in infected protoplasts Zhou and Jackson 1996a, Zhou and Jackson 1996b, we attempted to increase its abundance to improve the ease and reproducibility of promoter analysis. For this purpose, the clone \u03b21\u221234/+14 was created by removing nucleotides 755 through 802 (\u221234/+14 relative to the sgRNA\u03b21 transcription start site) on RNA\u03b2 (Fig. 4A).

Furthermore, the BSMV and PSLV sequences share a higher degree of similarity with each other than either does with LRSV. In the case of the BSMV sgRNA\u03b3 promoter, nearly 80% of the PSLV residues are identical (19/24) to the BSMV sequence, whereas a gapped alignment between BSMV and LRSV indicated a considerably lower degree of similarity (14/24 residues) within the aligned region. These results buttress the existing strong evidence for a common origin of the Hordeiviruses and support biological evidence, suggesting that BSMV and PSLV are more closely related to each other than to LRSV (Hunter et al., 1989).",

Initial comparisons using the NCBI BLAST program failed to reveal significant matches with other viral promoter sequences. To obtain more definitive comparisons, we analyzed the 300 nucleotides surrounding the start codons of the TGB proteins of Beet necrotic yellow vein virus, Peanut clump virus (PCV), Potato mop top virus (PMTV), Potato virus M (PVM), and Potato virus X (PVX). No obvious similarity was detected in comparisons of the sgRNA\u03b22 promoter regions, and only short blocks of common sequence were noted in the regions surrounding the putative sgRNA\u03b21 promoters. These common blocks primarily consisted of strings of A residues located at various positions upstream of the translational start site and hence they are unlikely to represent conserved promoter elements. Thus, the results indicate that the sequence conservation noted among the TGB proteins of the Hordeiviruses does not extend to the analogous TGB promoter regions of more distantly related viruses.",

Therefore, understanding the nature of the sgRNA promoters and the requirements for regulated expression of the mRNAs under their control will contribute substantially toward elucidating events required for systemic invasion and disease development in host plants.

RNA\u03b2 also requires an enhancer-like element located between \u221264 to \u221259 for production of sgRNA\u03b22. These three promoters are <50 nt in size and are located in close proximity to their respective transcription initiation sites. The sgRNA\u03b3 promoter lies primarily upstream of its transcription initiation site but includes the +1 nt that corresponds to the transcription start site and an additional nucleotide at the +2 position. The BSMV sgRNA\u03b21 and sgRNA\u03b22 promoters, which reside upstream of their transcription initiation sites, differ from other plant virus sgRNA promoters previously characterized because the sgRNA\u03b21 and sgRNA\u03b22 promoters appear not to overlap their transcription start sites (Miller and Koev, 2000). Independent experiments have demonstrated the importance of the +1 nt in the sgRNA promoters of a number of well-characterized viruses. For example, in vitro studies using the BMV proscript system to elucidate the minimal requirements for replicase recognition of the BMV sgRNA promoter have shown that changing the +1 nt of the promoter from a C to a G decreases sgRNA synthesis by more than 90% (Siegel et al., 1997). The importance of the +1 nt has also been shown in another Tricornavirus where changing the C to a U abolished AMV sgRNA promoter activity (Van Der Vossen et al., 1995). Similarly, when the +1 nt of the TMV MP sgRNA promoter was changed from a C to a G, sgRNA accumulation was below the limits of detection (Grdzelishvili et al., 2000). In contrast, transversion of the +1 nucleotides of the BYDV sgRNA2 and sgRNA3 promoters had no effect on sgRNA accumulation, even though both promoters span this region (Koev and Miller, 2000). Although the sgRNA\u03b3 promoter overlaps its transcription start site, we have not determined whether nucleotide substitutions at this position affect sgRNA synthesis.",

Two blocks of identical residues were identified in the sgRNA\u03b21 promoter regions (AAAAAU and CUAC).

Additional analyses of the less conserved regions failed to indicate preferences for particular purine or pyrimidine residues. These results indicate that the abundance and timing of transcription of the three Hordeivirus sgRNAs, \u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b3, may be regulated by promoter sequences that are only distantly related.

In these studies, a hybrid BSMV RNA\u03b2 containing PSLV TGB1, TGB2, and most of the TGB3 sequence was able to replicate and move through the vasculature to uninoculated leaves in plants coinoculated with the \u03b1 and \u03b3 RNAs (Solovyev et al., 1999).

These results suggest that the BSMV replicase complex can recognize the related PSLV sgRNA\u03b22 promoter, but it either cannot recognize the LRSV sgRNA\u03b22 promoter or the LRSV TGB proteins do not form sufficiently compatible interactions to mediate BSMV movement.",

Moreover, an equivalent degree of limited similarity was also observed in the regions upstream of the unrelated BNYVV p14 and the PCV TGB2 genes. Likewise, the sgRNA\u03b3 promoter shares small blocks of common sequence with the region upstream of the PCV p15 gene, which encodes a protein closely related to the \u03b3b protein, but the promoter also has similarity to the regions upstream of the unrelated BNYVV TGB1 and TMV p30 genes. The BSMV, BNYVV, PVM, and PCV replicase proteins belong to the supergroup 3 tobamo lineage of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Koonin and Dolja, 1993), so in these cases it is tempting to speculate that the promoter sequences coevolved in response to the polymerase specificity rather than as a block consisting of the promoter and its associated protein. However, the RdRp proteins of BMV and PVX are also classified in the supergroup 3 tobamo lineage, yet their sgRNA promoter sequences share no apparent similarity to the BSMV promoters.

This is surprising because in other viruses, sgRNA promoter recognition by replicase complexes often requires primary sequence as well as secondary structural elements. These requirements may facilitate diverse interactions between replicase complexes and promoters with limited sequence similarity. In BYDV, both RNA sequence and secondary structure are essential for promoter activity (Koev et al., 1999). The BYDV sgRNA1 promoter folds into two stem loops downstream of its transcription initiation site, but comparisons with the predicted structures of the sgRNA2 and sgRNA3 promoters reveal that they possess very different sized stem loops downstream of their respective transcription initiation sites (Koev and Miller, 2000). The TMV MP sgRNA promoter also requires a stem loop structure for promoter activity that will tolerate substantial variation in primary sequence without major effects on sgRNA synthesis (Grdzelishvili et al., 2000). In addition, chemical and enzymatic probing of the 1.45-kb sgRNA promoter of TCV has confirmed the presence of a 96-nt hairpin structure, although only a 21-nt hairpin and a 9-nt flanking single-stranded region comprise the minimal promoter (Wang et al., 1999). Thus, our comparisons suggest that BSMV promoters differ from those of a number of other viruses in that conservation of primary sequence rather than conserved structure may have a predominant role in promoter activity.",

In the case of sgRNA\u03b22, expression increased substantially upon removal of a 48-nt sequence required for sgRNA\u03b21 promoter activity. This result suggests that competition for replicase has an important role in mediating the levels of expression of sgRNA\u03b21 and sgRNA\u03b22. The ectopic expression experiments support this hypothesis because both the ectopic sgRNA\u03b3 and the sgRNA\u03b22 promoters directed transcription more efficiently in constructs lacking the wt promoters than in constructs with wt promoters. Positioning also appears to have variable effects on promoter activity. Accumulation of sgRNAs transcribed from promoters located close to the 3\u2032 terminus of the genomic-sense RNA was less abundant than those of the wt sgRNA from an upstream promoter. When the sgRNA\u03b3, sgRNA\u03b21, and sgRNA\u03b22 promoters were placed downstream of the wt sgRNA\u03b21 promoter in RNA\u03b2, the ectopic sgRNAs were considerably reduced in comparisons with the wt sgRNA\u03b21 (Fig. 5). However, in RNA\u03b3, the ectopic sgRNA\u03b3 promoter strength appeared to be similar to that of the wt sgRNA\u03b3 promoter. On the other hand, when the ectopic sgRNA\u03b22 promoter was placed downstream of the wt sgRNA\u03b3 promoter, the ectopic sgRNA accumulated to much lower levels than the wt sgRNA\u03b3 (Fig. 5C). In contrast to the larger regions encompassing the BSMV sgRNA promoters, the minimal BSMV promoter sequences were unable to function ectopically. These results suggest that positioning, flanking sequences, and, in the case of sgRNA\u03b22, an upstream enhancer element may contribute substantially to promoter strength. In particular, the reduction in activity resulting from placement of the BSMV sgRNA promoters near the 3\u2032 end of the genomic RNA contrasts with many examples reported from other RNA viruses where more 3\u2032 located ectopic promoters are preferentially transcribed French and Ahlquist 1988, Boccard and Baulcombe 1993, Wang and Simon 1997, Koev and Miller 2000.",

However, BSMV sgRNA\u03b21 and sgRNA\u03b22 promoters appear not to share this correlation because sgRNA\u03b22, which is proximal to the 3\u2032 terminus of RNA\u03b2, accumulates to much lower levels than the upstream sgRNA\u03b21. This pattern of synthesis for TGB sgRNAs has also been demonstrated for Potato virus X\n(Verchot et al., 1998) and is likely the case for the multicomponent Benyviruses,\nFuroviruses,\nPomoviruses, and Pecluviruses and the monopartite Carlaviruses, Allexiviruses, and Foveaviruses\n(van Regenmortel et al., 2000), which contain related TGBs. During replication of BSMV, PVX, and BNYVV, two sgRNAs are generated for translation of the overlapping TGB proteins. The relatively high abundance of sgRNA1 reflects the accumulation of the TGB1 protein during the early stages of infection, whereas the 3\u2032 proximal sgRNA\u03b22 is often difficult to detect Zhou and Jackson 1996a, Zhou and Jackson 1996b, Verchot et al 1998. It is possible that several evolutionary constraints may contribute to the low abundance of sgRNA\u03b22 and the analogous sgRNA in other TGB-containing viruses. One possibility is that the relative abundance of the proteins encoded by the sgRNAs may be important for the movement complex function. Alternatively, because the sgRNA\u03b22 promoter resides within the TGB1 ORF, optimal promoter strength may have been constrained by necessities for TGB1 protein function.",

This is especially evident in BSMV because the sgRNA\u03b21 core promoter is proximal to a cis-acting element required for RNA\u03b2 replication, and also for the sgRNA\u03b3 and sgRNA\u03b2 promoters, which overlap regions encoding the \u03b3a and TGB1 ORFs, respectively. Since the BSMV sgRNA promoter regions are multifunctional, it is likely that the replicase complex has coevolved with viral cis-acting elements to permit recognition of the three different sgRNA promoters and to discriminate between the distinct elements at the 3\u2032 ends of the positive- and negative-sense RNAs. These varied interactions may also help explain the temporal regulation of the sgRNA promoters in the same virus. For example, the diverse promoter\u2013replicase interactions within a virus may be facilitated by varied complexes of replicase and host proteins with distinct promoter elements. Such interactions may well mediate the strength and temporal activities of the BSMV sgRNA promoters.",

The digested clones were treated with T4 DNA polymerase to generate blunt ends and religated.

These intermediate plasmids were then digested with BamHI and ligated to each of the amplified subgenomic promoters (sgRNA\u03b3, sgRNA\u03b21, and sgRNA\u03b22) to generate clones \u03b21+sg\u03b3, \u03b21+sg\u03b21, \u03b21+sg\u03b22, \u03b2+sg\u03b3, \u03b2+sg\u03b21, \u03b2+sg\u03b22, \u03b31+sg\u03b3, \u03b31+sg\u03b21, \u03b31+sg\u03b22, \u03b3+sg\u03b3, \u03b3+sg\u03b21 and \u03b3+sg\u03b22. Since the sgRNA\u03b21 promoter contains a MluI site, the \u03b3 +sg\u03b21 and \u03b3 + sg\u03b21 clones were linearized for in vitro transcription reactions at a SpeI site introduced at their 3\u2032 termini with the BSMV3\u2032SpeI oligonucleotide (Table 1).",
