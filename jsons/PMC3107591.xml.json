Recently, a concerted effort has been made to unravel the phylogenetic and\ndemographic contexts that have led to this diversity of relationships (P\u00e9rez-Losada et al. 2007; Rector et\nal. 2007; Katzourakis et al. 2009; Smith et al. 2009). In particular, methodological\nadvances have enabled the incorporation of temporal information from time-structured\nsequence data into strict or relaxed molecular clock models (Drummond et al. 2005, 2006;\nDrummond and Rambaut 2007), which can then be\nused to estimate the timing of epidemiologically important events (cross-species\ntransmissions, epidemic outbreaks), as well as historically important ones (the origin of\nmultiple viral subtypes, host-pathogen codivergence). RNA viruses are particularly well\nsuited to analyses of this type as their rapid replication rate, large population sizes, and\nerror-prone polymerase result in large amounts of genetic diversity being generated in\nmeasurable amounts of evolutionary time. Sequence analysis programs such as Bayesian\nEvolutionary Analysis By Sampling Trees (BEAST) are of particular importance in this regard\nas they utilize the genetic variation present in a sample to simultaneously estimate both\ndemographic and evolutionary parameters in the context of time and space (Drummond et al. 2005, 2006; Drummond and Rambaut 2007; Lemey et al. 2009).",

Importantly,\ninferences about key aspects of viral biology including the rate of evolutionary change in\nthe viral genome and the timescale of speciation events, have often been made based on the\nassumption of host-virus codivergence, which automatically places the evolution of these\nviruses on the same scale as their hosts (Nakao et al.\n1997; Hughes and Friedman 2000; Sugimoto et al. 2002; Nishimoto et al. 2006; Krumbholz et al.\n2008). However, by incorporating timing information from time-sampled\n(heterochronous) sequences into inferences about the history of viral populations, it is\npossible to generate independent estimates of the rate and timescale of virus evolution,\nwithout requiring the strong assumption of codivergence. Critically, analyses of this type\nhave demonstrated that some host-virus systems that were once thought to be examples of\ncodivergence may in fact be the result of much more recent evolutionary associations (Shackelton et al. 2006; Romano et al. 2008; Harkins et al.\n2009; Lewis-Rogers and Crandall 2009;\nRamsden et al. 2009).",

For example, a time-dependent relationship has been\ndemonstrated to exist for the molecular clock, such that molecular evolution is accelerated\non short timescales (Ho et al. 2005; Ho and Larson 2006; Ho, Kolokotronis, and Allaby 2007; Ho, Shapiro,\net al. 2007). Concerns have also been raised regarding the tendency of inference\ntools to recover substitution rates that are too rapid when population structure in the data\nis unaccounted for or when inappropriate calibration points are used (Ho et al. 2008; Navascues and Emerson\n2009). Ascribing times to samples and accommodating these in analyses are\neffectively an assertion that these times span a consequential proportion of the total\nevolutionary history of the taxa in question and conditions the analysis on rates that are\nsufficiently high that this is true. Such analyses have been used extensively to estimate\nthe evolutionary and epidemiological characteristics of a wide range of rapidly evolving RNA\nand single-stranded DNA viruses and appear to return estimates that accord well with the\nknown epidemiology of these pathogens (Shackelton et al.\n2005; de Oliveira et al. 2006; Bryant et al. 2007; Rambaut et al. 2008; Firth et al. 2009).\nHowever, the utility of these methods in estimating the evolutionary dynamics of\ndouble-stranded (ds) DNA viruses, which may evolve far more slowly than RNA viruses, has not\nyet been investigated. Indeed, the use of heterochronous phylogenetic modeling has resulted\nin surprisingly high evolutionary rate estimates for JC virus (Shackelton et al. 2006), variola virus (VARV) (Li et al. 2007), and the bacterium Neisseria\ngonorrhoeae (P\u00e9rez-Losada et al.\n2007).",

Indeed,\nRector et al. (2007) suggest that dsDNA viruses\nare inappropriate for time-structured analyses because their low mutation rates (\u223c0.003\nmutations/genome/replication, Drake 1991; Drake and Hwang 2005; Duffy et al. 2008) will lead to immeasurable levels of genetic change over a given\nsampling interval. This raises the possibility that the high rates of evolutionary change\npreviously reported for dsDNA viruses arise spuriously, and possibly inevitably, from the\nmodels employed. However, if no measurable evolutionary change has occurred within a given\nsampling period, we would expect any analytical outcomes to exhibit behavior consistent with\na lack of temporal structure in the data. Here, we use a variety of human dsDNA virus\nsystems to investigate the ability of heterochronous phylogenetic modeling to 1) accurately\nestimate the fit of a molecular clock to dsDNA virus data sets with varying sample sizes and\ndistributions, 2) recover the correct nucleotide substitution rate or reveal that there is a\nlack of temporal structure in the data, and 3) place the time to the most recent common\nancestor (TMRCA) of these viruses within the correct time frame (when known). To further\nassess the behavior of these analytical tools, we created synthetic data sets under a\nvariety of sampling schemes and substitution rates, from an \u201cRNA virus-like\u201d rate of 1 \u00d7\n10\u22124 substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year) to a \u201cdsDNA virus-like\u201d\nrate of 1 \u00d7 10\u22128 subs/site/year. Using these data, we examined the ability of\nstandard modeling tools to recover the nucleotide substitution rate and TMRCA from a\npopulation when the true evolutionary history of a sample is known.",

The first unequivocal\ndescription of smallpox in human populations occurred in 4th century AD in China, although\ncases have been suspected as far back as 1,122 BC (Li et\nal. 2007). Previous estimates based on time-structured sequence data have placed\nthe origin of smallpox at 207\u2013231 ybp using strict and relaxed clocks, respectively (Li et al. 2007). However, this extremely recent\nestimate has been disregarded as being at odds with both historical/epidemiological data and\nwith the low genetic diversity identified in serially sampled sequences (Esposito et al. 2006; Li et al. 2007). As a result, these authors have suggested that their evolutionary\nrate estimates may be upwardly biased by the use of heterochronous phylogenetic models. In\ncontrast, calibration with historical records of smallpox infection (all of which are\ndebatable) placed the TMRCA for VARV at 1,400\u20136,300 ybp, depending on the choice of\ncalibration point, with correspondingly lower substitution rates (Li et al. 2007; Babkin and Shchelkunov\n2008; Hughes et al. 2009; Shchelkunov 2009). Importantly, any calibration of\ncontemporary strains using historical records is potentially problematic as selective sweeps\nand population bottlenecks can purge genetic diversity from the population, resulting in a\nTMRCA that is far more recent than the historical association of the virus with its\nhost.",

Synthetic data sets were\ngenerated to reflect the evolutionary processes in two of the seven dsDNA data sets\nanalyzed, VARV and HSV-1, which represent the typical range one might encounter in an\nanalysis of temporally sampled data (table 1).\nThe VARV-like synthetic data consisted of 50 sequences of 100,000 bp sampled from 1946 to\n1982 (similar to a full-genome alignment), whereas the HSV-1-like synthetic data consisted\nof 84 sequences that were 1,200 bp in length, sampled from 1981 to 2008 (a typical\nsingle-gene alignment). Sequences for each data set were generated in the following\nmanner. The year-of-sampling distribution associated with the sequences was fixed to those\nvalues from the VARV and HSV-1 data sets, and random phylogenies were drawn from a\ncoalescent process based on each group of taxa (N = 50 or 84) using an\nMCMC algorithm and assuming a constant population size. The root height for each phylogeny\nwas fixed at one of the following intervals: 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000\nybp. Sequences of the appropriate length were simulated along each random tree following\nthe HKY model of sequence evolution with data set-specific base frequencies and\ntransition/transversion ratios based on the ML estimate of these values from the actual\nvirus data sets. Gamma-distributed rate variation was also initially added to the\nHSV-1-like simulations, but as the inclusion of this parameter did not impact the results\nof the simulations, it was removed from additional replications (data not shown). For the\nfirst set of synthetic data, the rate of evolution followed a strict molecular clock\n(standard deviation [SD] around the mean rate of 0.0) set at one of the following values\ncorresponding to each specified value of the root height: 1 \u00d7 10\u22124\nsubs/site/year (when the root height was 100 ybp), 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 subs/site/year, 1 \u00d7\n10\u22126 subs/site/year, 1 \u00d7 10\u22127 subs/site/year, and 1 \u00d7\n10\u22128 subs/site/year (when the root height was one million ybp). Twenty\nindependent replicate data sets were created for each root height/clock rate and each\nvirus type. These synthetic data sets contained a similar number of variant sites to the\nactual data sets, indicating that we were correctly modeling the true pattern of evolution\n(data not shown). By covarying the tree height and substitution rate in this manner, the\nobserved genetic diversity of each synthetic data set was held constant and similar to\nthat observed in the VARV and HSV-1 data sets. This allowed for a direct assessment of the\npower of this method to estimate substitution rates under successive conditions in which\nsmaller proportions of overall genetic diversity can be attributed to the sampling\ninterval. Posterior inference was performed on each data set assuming a strict molecular\nclock, the HKY model of nucleotide substitution and constant population size. MCMC\nsimulations were run for 100 million generations, with subsampling every 10,000\ngenerations. Convergence of all parameters was verified visually using the program Tracer\n(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/).",

The first\nis that epidemiologically linked isolates appear to accumulate no mutational changes over\nthe period of 1 year (Li et al. 2007). However,\nit is also theoretically possible to explain this observation by invoking selective sweeps\nor severe population bottlenecks during transmission, which act to reduce the variability\naccrued during replication in a single individual. The second factor opposing high\nevolutionary rates for VARV is the suggestion of congruence between historical records of\nthe introduction and spread of the virus in various locations, and the TMRCAs estimated\nfor the major VARV clades. However, as noted above, the use of historical records as\ncalibration points from which the rate and divergence times of viruses are estimated is\nproblematic. In particular, these epidemiological records do not necessarily correlate\nwith the true origin or introduction of a pathogen, as revealed by the different dates\nused for the same introductions of VARV in multiple locations, and the last common\nancestor of any contemporaneously sampled set of viruses may be of more recent origin than\nthe common ancestor of the entire species (Hughes et al.\n2009; Shchelkunov 2009). Calibrating\nevolutionary analyses using a time point that predates the age of the most recent common\nancestor of a sample will bias the substitution rate and divergence date estimates toward\na much older history (and correspondingly lower substitution rates). In contrast, the\ncurrent analysis only estimates the TMRCA of the sample, not of VARV itself, and may\ntherefore return TMRCA estimates more recent than the known age of this human pathogen,\nparticularly if there has been a large-scale reduction in diversity (i.e., selective sweep\nor population bottleneck) in the recent history of VARV. Although we cannot exclude all\nestimation errors in the case of VARV, the high level of genetic variation in our data\nexplained by temporal sampling (R2 = 0.68) lends support to\nthe existence of rapid evolutionary rates in VARV (Hughes et al. 2009, this study).",

A key measure of the\nevolutionary rate of herpesviruses originated from the analysis of 63 variable restriction\nendonuclease sites in 242 HSV-1 samples from three human populations represented by six\ncountries: Asian (Korea, Japan, and China), African (Kenya), and European (Sweden and the\nUnited States) (Sakaoka et al. 1994). Based on\nrough estimates of the divergence times between these ethnic groups (110,000 years for the\nsplit between African and European/Asian populations and 50,000 years for the split of\nAsian from European groups) and the nucleotide differences between them, a substitution\nrate of 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22128 subs/site/year was estimated (Sakaoka et al. 1994). This rate is two-to-three orders of magnitude\nlower than any of the substitution rates we estimate here, including that of HSV-1 and\nVARV (table 2). Hughes et al.

However, a gene-specific mutation rate of\napproximately 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 mutations/site/replication has been experimentally\nderived for the thymidine kinase gene of HSV-1 (the same gene analyzed here), an estimate\ncongruent with both the substitution rate estimated by Sakaoka et al.

The most likely mechanism through which\nsuch an inflated substitution rate could occur is through strong and continuous positive\nselection. To test for the presence of positive selection within our HSV-1 thymidine\nkinase gene alignment, the overall ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions per\nsite (dN/dS) was estimated using\nthe program HyPhy (Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2005).\nThe dN/dS ratio for this data set\nwas 0.700, consistent with either localized positive selection on some codons or perhaps a\nsubstantial relaxation of purifying selection on this gene, as has been previously\nsuggested (Drake and Hwang 2005). Hence, although\npositive selection may be contributing to the high substitution rates estimated for this\ngene, it seems highly unlikely that such adaptive evolution could result in a substitution\nrate that is three orders of magnitude higher than expected. We are therefore unable to\nconclusively reconcile the high substitution rates estimated here for HSV-1 (and\npotentially the related VZ virus), with what is known about the background mutation rate\nand biology of herpesviruses.

However, we cannot simply attribute the remarkably similar rate estimates across\nthe seven viruses to an error in the method of estimation, as we were unable to recover\ncomparably high estimates from the analysis of our synthetic data sets. Although we have\nlittle confidence in the rates estimated for some of our data sets (HAdV-C, VZ, HPV-16),\nothers are suggestive of high substitution rates in dsDNA viruses (VARV, HAdV-B, and\nperhaps HSV-1 and BK) and clearly merit further investigation. It is possible to identify\ntwo general mechanisms that may be driving the substitution rate of these viruses above\nthe background mutation rate (\u223c2 \u00d7 10\u22128 to 7 \u00d7 10\u22127\nmutations/site/replication, Drake et al. 1998).\nFirst, as the rate of viral replication directly impacts the long-term substitution rate\n(this parameter is analogous to generation time), very high replication rates have the\npotential to inflate the substitution rates of dsDNA viruses (McLysaght et al. 2003; Gubser et\nal. 2004; Esposito et al. 2006; Hughes et al. 2009). The impact of high replication\nrates may be particularly important for those viruses that are highly transmissible and/or\nresult in acute infections in humans (VARV, HAdV-B) but are unlikely to have a similar\neffect in those viruses causing asymptomatic, latent, and/or chronic infections (BK,\nHSV-1) in the host. Unfortunately, the replication rates of these viruses during natural\ninfections in the host are unknown. Second, as discussed in the context of HSV-1, strong\n(diversifying) positive selection could also act to increase the substitution rate above\nthe (neutral) mutation rate. Positive selection is most likely to be observed in viruses\nthat cause a strong immune response in the host or are the target of intense vaccination\nor intervention campaigns. However, as with replication rates, relatively little is known\nabout the extent and nature of adaptive evolution in dsDNA viruses, although to date\npositive selection has not been identified in the protein-coding genes of VARV (Hughes et al. 2009).",
