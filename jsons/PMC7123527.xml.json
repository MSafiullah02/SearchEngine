Considerations in the differential diagnosis include infection, collagen vascular disease, acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), drug effect, and other causes of DAD. Most cases of DAD are not AIP, and detailed clinical information, radiologic findings, serologic data, and microbiologic results will often point to or rule out a specific etiologic condition. Use of special stains applied to tissue sections or cytologic preparations also is essential to rule out infectious organisms in this setting. AIP is characterized by the histologic pattern of DAD (Fig. 22.6). AIP cannot be distinguished from DAD on histology alone [33].",
