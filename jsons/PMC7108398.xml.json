            "text": "The innate and the adaptive immune system work together to detect transformed cells and remove them before they form a tumor [1]. The anti-tumor response starts with the release of tumor associated antigens (TAA) from dying cancer cells and accompanying signal molecules, which attract and activate cells of the innate immune system [[2], [3]]. Whereas NK and \u03b3d-T cells can recognize and kill tumor cells directly, antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as DCs and macrophages, take up TAAs to activate the adaptive immune system [[4], [5]]. The maturation of APCs by the accompanying danger signal molecules determines the skewing to a preferred T helper cell (Th) 1 response. These Th1 signals constitute of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-12, type I interferons (IFNs) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), such as nuclear protein HMGB1, heat-shock proteins and ATP, [3]. The Th1 cytokines stimulate the generation of tumor specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTLs), which are crucial effector cells in the antitumor response [6]. Subsequently, effector T cells, including T helper cells and CTLs, are attracted to the tumor site via a gradient of T cell attracting chemokines, including chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL5/RANTES, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9), and CXCL10 [7]. At the site, CTLs recognize and kill tumor cells mediated by MHCI-T cell receptor interactions. If the immune system succeeds in destruction of the beginning tumor, the host remains free of cancer.",

            "text": "In some cases, tumor cells are reprogrammed to evade the immune system resulting in an equilibrium between dying tumor cells and tumor cells surviving the immune attack. As a consequence, a selection of immunosuppressive or less immunogenic tumor cell variants is introduced, which cannot be eliminated by the immune system [8]. These tumor cells establish a tumor microenvironment (TME), in which the function of anti-tumor immune cells is attenuated (Fig. 1\n) [9]. First of all, tumor cells and stromal cells (endothelial and epithelial cells and fibroblasts) produce factors such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and IL-10, that disrupt APC maturation in the TME [[3], [7], [9]]. As a result, DCs isolated from the TME often display a partly matured, immune suppressive phenotype and secrete cytokines that induce non-favorable Th2 responses [7]. Secondly, tumors inhibit infiltration of effector T cells by repressing the production of T cell attracting chemokines CXCL9/10 and modification of CCL2 [[7], [10]]. Thirdly, effector T cells that can infiltrate the tumor are attenuated by expression of several immunosuppressive molecules and persistent exposure to tumor antigens. As a result, T helper cells and CTLs isolated from the TME often present an exhausted phenotype, characterized by high level expression of immune checkpoint receptors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) [10]. Ligation of these receptors with their ligands expressed on tumor and stromal cells, but also immunosuppressed APCs, leads to inhibition of the tumor specific T cell response. Fourthly, regulatory immune cells such as CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are recruited to the tumor site. Similar to tumor cells, Tregs secrete IL-10, Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and TGF-\u03b2, leading to further attenuation of the T cell response [[7], [11]]. Furthermore, Tregs consume IL-2, which is indispensable for T cell activation [7]. MDSCs contribute to the suppression of effector T cells through production of arginase and nitric oxide, which deprives T cells from amino acids necessary for proliferation [12].",

            "text": "Oncolytic virotherapy is an approach that uses oncolytic viruses (OVs), either with natural tropism for neoplastic cells or genetically modified to enhance selectivity for tumor cells [[18], [19]]. Tumor cells often lack an adequate antiviral response, making them more susceptible to OV infection than healthy cells. The viral infection leads to tumor regression through two distinct mechanisms: direct killing of tumor cells by replication dependent induced cell death and promotion of an antitumor response towards all tumor cells, including non-infected cells, by inducing immunogenic cell death. Types of immunogenic cell death, such as immunogenic apoptosis, necrosis and autophagic cell death, are characterized by the release of TAAs in combination with DAMPs and viral pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [19]. Following the secretion of DAMPs and cytokines, more innate immune cells, such as macrophages, DCs, NK cells and neutrophils infiltrate the tumor environment. The immune stimulating cytokine secretion leads to maturation of APCs and hence presentation of TAAs and viral antigens to activate the adaptive immune system in the lymph nodes. Cytotoxic T cells will start infiltrating the tumor again and specifically eliminate cancer cells. Simultaneously, memory T cells are formed, which improves protection against new tumor challenges in mouse models [[20], [21]]. Therefore, it is evident that OV therapy can function as a \u2018kick start\u2019 for the antitumor immune response by providing TAAs in an immunogenic manner and inducing infiltration of immune cells.",

Recombinant OVs armed with immune modulators further enhance the activation of the immune system and overcome the immunosuppressive TME [18]. The first armed OV approved by the FDA is oncolytic Herpes-Simplex-Virus (HSV)-1 expressing GM-CSF showing improvement of melanoma treatment, but no cure yet (T-VEC) [22]. Therefore, many more immune modulator armed OV therapies followed and their obstacles and opportunities have come to light. This review will give an overview of the state-of-the-art therapies used in combination with immune modulators to treat cancer patients and give a hint on potential future directions.",

For this reason, one of the first immune therapeutic approaches in cancer treatment was the administration of recombinant cytokines. As described before, the most essential cytokines in the anti-tumor response are IL-12, GM-CSF, IL-2 and IL-2-related cytokines IL-15 and IL-21, and they all stimulate different parts of the immune system [23]: GM-CSF recruits APCs to the TME [17], IL-12 is normally expressed by APCs and stimulates polarization of T helper cells to a Th1 phenotype, IL-2 is a T cell growth factor and improves T cell expansion [9], and the IL-2-related cytokines promote survival of T cells, but also play an important role in NK cell activation [23]. Despite the their plethora of immune modulatory actions, cytokines have lost their popularity as a monotherapy, because of their low objective response rates and non-negligible side effects upon systemic administration [[24], [25]].",

            "text": "One of the most promising immune therapeutics are checkpoint inhibitors. Inhibitory receptors such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 act as checkpoints to avoid over activation and are expressed by T cells and inhibit the T cell activation in the lymph nodes and survival in the TME [26]. Several checkpoint inhibitors have been approved by the FDA of which the first were against CTLA-4 and PD-1. Treatment with these inhibitors results in reactivation of the suppressed immune cells [[14], [15]]. In addition, blocking of CTLA-4 can lead to depletion of Tregs [25]. Combinations of a-CTLA-4 antibody and a-PD-1 antibody have shown to increase responses to treatment of advanced melanoma. However, the frequency of severe immune-related adverse events was also enhanced in clinical studies (16.3 \u221227.3% in monotherapy group vs. 55% in combination therapy group) [16]. Another disadvantage of these therapies is the fact that tumors can become resistant towards checkpoint inhibitors [27]. As a result, a variety of other co-inhibitory receptors, such as lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin receptor protein 3 (TIM-3), have recently been identified. LAG-3 is normally activated by its ligand MHCII on APCs and indirectly reduces T cell proliferation [28]. Interaction of TIM-3 with its ligand galectin-9, expressed by Tregs, induces cell death in Th1 cells [28]. Blockage of these inhibitory receptors can unleash potent antitumor CTL responses and are now in clinical or preclinical development [[17], [28]].",

In contrast to IL-2, Il-15 can stimulate only NK and effector T-cells, whereas IL-2 has also the undesirable effect of stimulating Tregs [50]. Even though systemic treatment with IL-15 induces less toxic effects local expression of IL-15 mediated by armed Vescilular Stomatitus virus (VSV) enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to VSV treatment combined with systemic IL-15 in murine models [57]. Vectorization by NDV demonstrated that IL-15 induced more CTL infiltration and increased activation of tumor-specific effector cells resulting in improved survival rates compared to IL-2 in a melanoma mouse model [58]. Altogether, these studies indicate that treatment with OVs expressing IL-15 is more efficient than systemic treatment with IL-15 or treatment with OVs expressing IL-2.",

The authors did not observe any difference in viral replication, even though IFN-\u03b3 is also known for its antiviral activity. In another murine study, treatment with NDV- IFN-\u03b3 did not result in a significant beneficial effect compared to unarmed NDV [55].

Important chemokines in the TME are CCL2, CCL5 (RANTES), CXCL9 and CXCL10, which attract Th1 cells and CTLs and CCL22, which attracts undesirable Tregs [63]. Combination of OV therapy with a chemokine modulating cocktail, which induces production of CCL5 and CXCL10 while reducing CCL22, was shown to promote trafficking of T helper cells and CTLs to the TME and resulted in improved survival in a murine colon cancer model [64]. Administration of viruses armed with CCL5 or CCL2 both resulted in increased numbers of infiltrating Th1 cells in colon cancer and neuroblastoma [[65], [66], [67]]. In conclusion, these studies have shown that the use of OVs armed with chemokines efficiently increased the infiltration of T cells into the tumor. However, none of the studies have assessed the infiltration of immune cells in distant tumors and tumor reduction has not been mentioned.",

            "text": "CTLA-4 is a checkpoint inhibitor that inhibits early stages of T cell activation in the lymph nodes, but also stimulates undesirable Treg functions [[28], [68]]. Blockage of CTLA-4 signaling releases a brake on T cell activation and even depletes intratumoral Tregs [28]. Intratumoral administration of NDV combined with systemic treatment with anti-CTLA-4 (Ipilimumab) showed improved antitumor effect mediated by CTLs and NK cells in a murine melanoma model [70]. Studies using combinations of systemic CTLA-4 blockade with other OVs (VV [[71], [72]] and VSV [20]) showed prolonged survival in renal [71], lung [72] and mammary [20] tumor models, long term protection to re-challenge with tumor cells [[71], [72]], and even cured mice [20]. Moreover, T-VEC combined with systemic CTLA-4 blockade has been evaluated for therapy in melanoma patients, which yielded a tumor growth control that was significantly greater than observed after both monotherapies [73]. The incidence of severe adverse effects was similar to Ipilimumab monotherapy [68], [73]. Local expression of anti-CTLA-4 induced by administration of adenovirus armed with anti-CTLA-4 resulted in significantly higher concentrations of the antibody in the treated tumor, while plasma levels remained at concentrations indicated as safe in murine models [74]. However, Engeland et al. demonstrated that treatment with MV armed with anti-CTLA-4 was less efficient than intratumoral treatment with MV combined with systemic administration of anti-CTLA-4, presumably because the major site of action of CTLA-4 is in the lymph node and not in the periphery [75]. Though local expression may lead to transient expression of the transgene in tumor draining lymph nodes, this study indicated that systemic anti-CTLA-4 therapy may be required for optimal responses.",

While CTLA-4 inhibits T cells in early activation stages in the lymph nodes, PD-1 signaling limits the function of activated T cells at later stages of the immune response taking place in tumors and tissues [68]. Multiple OVs such as MV [76], reovirus [[77], [78]], and VSV [[79], [80]], have been combined with systemic PD-1 blockade in treatment of murine glioblastoma [76], melanoma [[77], [78]], and acute myeloid leukemia [79] tumor models, resulting in enhanced influx of CTLs in the tumors and prolonged survival in mice. Specifically CTLs and NK cells, but not T helper cells, were shown to mediate the beneficial effects [[77], [79], [81]]. Moreover, a phase 1b clinical trial with the FDA approved T-VEC combined with PD-1 resulted in good response rates in patients [82]. Arming Myxoma Virus (MYXV) with anti-PD-1 did result in improved survival in mice as well [81]. However, local expression induced by administration of MV or VV armed with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 demonstrated to be as efficient as therapy with unarmed VV combined with systemic anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 treatment in murine tumor models [[75], [83]]. In conclusion, these studies suggest that OVs combined with checkpoint inhibitors improve treatment, but the benefits of vectorization differ per oncolytic virus.",

Nevertheless, several OVs armed with B7-1 have been tested in (pre)- clinical trials for the treatment of melanoma [[41], [84], [85], [86]]. Replication defective HSV expressing soluble B7-1 induced a prolonged tumor specific immune response in mice bearing neuroblastoma tumors [84]. VV expressing B7-1 was eventually evaluated in melanoma patients, where the treatment was well tolerated, but only few patients responded [86]. Overall, OV expression of B7-1 seems to have additional benefits in combination with other transgenes, but not as a single transgene.",

A combination of oncolytic VV with systemic anti-4-1BB administration in a breast cancer model resulted in increased survival and tumor infiltration by CTLs compared to both monotherapies in patients (40% survival vs. 0% survival) [88]. Local expression of 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) by oncolytic VV in mice has demonstrated to enhance tumor regression and this effect was enhanced even more in combination with lymph node depletion in order to slow down viral clearance [89]. Local injection of the armed virus resulted in an improved CTL/Treg ratio in the TME. In another study, vectorization of both IL-12 and 4-1BBL by adenovirus increased T helper, CTL and DC infiltration, which resulted in improved survival of the mice [42]. In other murine models, DC vaccination combined with the armed adenovirus combined treatment yielded even better results and DCs showed enhanced migration to the tumor draining lymph node, where they activated T cells [42]. These studies have shown that vectorization of this immune modulator in OVs enhances its therapeutic efficacy.",

Arming of OV with OX40L has been described once: adenovirus expressing OX40L led to suppression of melanoma, lung and colon tumor growth in mice. This effect was mediated by Th1 cells and CTLs and an increase in Th1 rather than Th2 cytokine expression [95]. A study combining systemic OX40L therapy with systemic 4-1BBL therapy and IL-12 expressing adenovirus, revealed increased expression of Th1 cytokines. thereby the antitumor CTL response were enhanced leading to tumor rejection in a colorectal cancer model involving liver metastases compared to OX40L monotherapy and combined 4-1BBL and IL-12 armed OV treatment [96].

Treatment of mice with VV expressing a PGE2 inactivating enzyme named hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD), resulted in a decreased number of MDSCs in the tumor and yielded a better response than other PGE2 blocking agents [100].

Moreover, viral expression of GM-CSF and IL-12 in the TME shifted the intratumoral cytokine profile from a Th2 to a preferred Th1 response and improved DC migration to the tumor site [[106], [107]]. Similarly, viral co-expression of IL-12 and IL-18 showed enhanced therapeutic efficacy and increased infiltration of DCs and effector T cells compared to mono-expression of IL-12 in murine models [[41], [42], [108]]. The combination of IL-12 and IL-18 showed to have synergistic effects on IFN-\u03b3 production, an important Th1 effector cytokine, by T cells and NK cells and polarization towards a Th1 response [[28], [109]].

Co-administration of oncolytic adenovirus expressing GM-CSF and oncolytic adenovirus expressing anti-CTLA-4 has been shown to yield additive antitumor activity in a lung cancer mouse model [110]. Furthermore, T-VEC in combination with systemic treatment with anti-CTLA-4 resulted in significantly improved tumor growth control rates in patients with advanced melanoma compared to both monotherapies alone [73]. Currently T-VEC in combination with anti-PD-1 is being evaluated in clinical trials [111], but the results are still unknown. In addition, Sorensen et al. engineered a replication deficient adenovirus expressing a TAA. By combining administration of this virus with systemic administration of CD40 stimulatory antibodies and CTLA-4 blockage, tumor growth of melanoma was reduced and long term survival was observed in 30\u201340% of mice in contrast to the monotherapies [112]. Thus, stimulation of both DCs and T cells is necessary for long term anti-tumor immune response. Therefore, these (pre-)clinical trials with combination-therapies demonstrate the potential to improve current therapies.",

            "text": "One of the greatest advantages of OVs armed with immune modulators is that this therapy often induces safer systemic and/or more effective localized concentrations of the modulator than systemic monotherapy [[58], [86], [92]]. Nevertheless, vectorization of checkpoint inhibitors can also limit the potency of the immune therapies by incorrect localization and timing and no resilience in case of tumor resistance. With regard to localization, a checkpoint receptor, such as CTLA-4, is mainly functional in the lymph node and requires systemic delivery of the blocking antibodies [72]. For instance, the anti-CTLA-4 armed MV proved to be less effective than monotherapy with CTLA-4 inhibitors [75]. Similar results were found for PD-L1 inhibitors delivered by MV and VV [[75], [83]], illustrating the second disadvantage of OVs armed with checkpoint inhibitors: the timing of administration of combined therapies. Rojas et al. and Gao et al. demonstrated that systemic administration of immune therapeutics given shortly (1\u20133 days) after OV therapy resulted in additive efficacy of the combination therapy in contrast to immune therapeutics given prior to OV administration [[71], [113]]. However, timing strategies may differ per virus as was seen with the armed MYXV where vectorization of anti-PD-1 did result in additive effects [81]. In addition to localization and timing, multiple studies have shown the development of resistance towards these checkpoint inhibitors over time in which new inhibitory molecules were upregulated on the cancer cells rendering the therapy ineffective [27]. Systemic administration of checkpoint inhibitors would allow for an easier transition between checkpoint therapies if necessary. Therefore, we think that arming viruses with checkpoint inhibitors might not be the most effective combination strategy.",

These immune cells express a known and stable subset of cytokine and co-stimulatory receptors and hence circumvent the treatment resistance as is seen with checkpoint inhibitors. Several studies have shown the additive effects of OVs armed with these agonistic agents compared to OV therapy alone (Table 1). In addition, the localized expression of agonistic agents reduces adverse effects in contrast to systemic administration and still allow combination therapy with checkpoint inhibitors [[58], [114], [115]]. Based on the reviewed studies, we reason that both cytokines and agonists targeting co-stimulatory receptors are very promising as immune modulators in the OV treatment against solid tumors.",

The virus determines both the \u2018kick-start\u2019 effect, which initiates the inflammation, and the concentration and duration of expression of the vectorized immune modulators. However, viruses differ in the effectiveness in killing the target cell or in expressing the immune modulator. For example, in a study comparing VSV with a replication defective adeno virus, both expressing CD40L, it was shown that the replication defective virus was superior in increasing survival rates over the replicative virus [116]. This is probably because of the low immunogenicity of the replication defective virus resulting in reduced viral clearance by the immune system and hence more immune modulator secretion. However, whether the benefits of a weaker immune response hold true for all therapies remains unknown and probably depends on the virus.",

For instance, for NDV it has been shown that the insertion site in the virus determines the expression levels of the transgene [56]. The effect of the insertion site may also hold true for other OVs, but is often not discussed. In addition, the size of the immune modulators is also of importance. Studies using a complete monoclonal antibody, only the light chain or a single-chain variable fragment showed that smaller proteins were more effectively produced than the larger proteins by cells infected with VV. However, the single chain fragment without an IgG domain was degraded faster in the TME, resulting in similar antitumor activity as the monoclonal antibody [83]. As not all viruses tolerate large insertions, this information should be considered when deciding which modulator to incorporate. However, predicting the efficiency of the modulator expression remains difficult, because differences in expression levels can occur between tumors independent of the virus [110].",

            "text": "While moving forward with OV immune therapies to the clinic, safety ought to be considered once more. So far, no adverse effects have been reported on the therapies combining OV with immune therapies in murine models or clinical trials. Nevertheless, adverse effects of the viral infection, such as excessive viral replication or expression of the immune modulators leading to an overreaction of the immune system cannot be excluded yet. A possibility to reduce the risks on adverse effects would be the incorporation of a fail-safe mechanism into the OV therapy to abort viral replication if necessary. Only for HSV, drugs are available to inhibit viral replication [117]. Alternatively, virus with attenuated virulence or viruses with a different host range may be used. In addition, incorporation of suicide genes, such as thymidine kinase [117], rat cytochrome P450 [118] or cytosine deaminase [119], would allow inhibition of viral replication by using drugs as well. Moreover, it could add to the tumor lytic efficacy of the therapy [120]. During OV therapy, the immune modulator is not incorporated into the host genome and therefore expression levels are dependent on viral replication which is usually transient. Thus, controlling the viral replication would reduce the risks on severe adverse effects of the immune modulators.",

Not only tumors develop over time, but the immune system as well. This means that every stage of immune activation should be considered while deciding on the incorporation of an immune modulator (Fig. 2\n). Weak immunogenic tumors in an immunosuppressive TME will likely benefit from potent oncolytic viruses, cytokines and innate stimulating agonists to activate the initial innate immune response. If eventually the tumor is inflamed, effector T cells and NK cells responses can be improved by immune activating agonists, such as 4-1BBL, and checkpoint inhibitors. The vectorization of both cytokines and immune activating agonists could reduce possible adverse effects compared to systemic administration, whereas systemic delivery of checkpoint inhibitors improves the timing and localization of the treatment. Future directions will have to explore multiple combinations of dually armed OVs allowing to overcome tumor heterogeneity or at least to use both OVs and immune modulators to their full potential.",
