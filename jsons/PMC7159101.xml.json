Each study subject contributed a whole saliva sample and a paper point sample pooled from the deepest periodontal pocket in each quadrant of the dentition, and the test bacteria were identified using a 16S ribosomal RNA\u2010based PCR assay (15). A statistical relationship was found between the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Treponema denticola in whole saliva and in periodontal pocket samples, and in the event of disagreement, the organisms were more frequently present in whole saliva than in periodontal pockets (P < 0.01). The oral presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Tannerella forsythia was not reliably detected by sampling either whole saliva or periodontal pockets. Other studies also found that a salivary sample alone did not identify all individuals infected with A. actinomycetemcomitans (176, 200). Taken together, a sample of whole saliva seems to be superior to a pooled periodontal pocket sample for detecting oral P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens and T. denticola, but samples of both whole saliva and periodontal pockets may be needed in order to detect oral A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. forsythia with reasonably good accuracy. The reason for this is that A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. forsythia can persist in nondental sites, as best demonstrated in fully edentulous individuals (55, 194).",

The study subjects included 49 African\u2013Americans, 48 Asian\u2013Americans, 50 Hispanics and 52 Caucasians living in Los Angeles. Periodontal probing depth was positively associated with all six study bacteria. African\u2013Americans were at increased risk (compared with Caucasians) for harboring P. gingivalis in saliva [odds ratio (OR) 2.95] and orally (OR 2.66), and at reduced risk for harboring T. denticola orally (OR 0.34). Asian\u2013Americans showed an increased risk for harboring A. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (OR 6.63) and for harboring P. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (OR 5.39), in saliva (OR 5.74) and orally (OR 5.81). Hispanics demonstrated an increased risk for harboring A. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (OR 12.27), and for harboring P. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (OR 6.07), in saliva (OR 8.72) and orally (OR 7.98). Age was positively associated with the prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans orally (OR 1.18), and with P. gingivalis in saliva (OR 1.20) and orally (OR 1.20). The male gender was a risk factor for harboring P. intermedia in periodontal pockets (OR 2.40), in saliva (OR 3.31) and orally (OR 4.25), and for harboring P. nigrescens in saliva (OR 2.85). The longer the subjects had resided in the USA, the greater the decrease in detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans orally (OR 0.82). Former smokers demonstrated a decreased risk for harboring A. actinomycetemcomitans in saliva (OR 0.23), and current smokers displayed an increased risk for harboring T. denticola in periodontal pockets (OR 4.61). Current and passive smokers revealed less salivary P. nigrescens than nonsmokers (127). In sum, the study found a relationship between the presence of periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva and in periodontal pockets, and pointed to the importance of genetic or environmental factors in the colonization of these pathogens. Salivary tests for periodontitis may show increased accuracy if supplementing infectious disease variables with ethnic and social factors and with smoking habits (177).",

            "text": "Studies have evaluated the salivary route of transmission of periodontopathic bacteria. Transmission of periodontal pathogens from person to person depends on the salivary load of pathogens in the donor subject and various ecological factors in the recipient (16). An early epidemiologic study found that members of the same family were infected with A. actinomycetemcomitans strains of the same biotype and serotype (213). However, even in families with individuals heavily infected with A. actinomycetemcomitans, some family members did not harbor the organism, attesting to a relatively poor transmissibility of A. actinomycetemcomitans (213). A study based on bacterial typing by means of the arbitrarily primed PCR method revealed an interspousal transmission of A. actinomycetemcomitans in 4/11 (36%) of married couples and of P. gingivalis in 2/10 (20%) of married couples (17). Parent\u2010to\u2010child transmission of A. actinomycetemcomitans took place in 6/19 (32%) families, whereas P. gingivalis was not transmitted from parent to child in any of the families studied (17). Similarities in the profile of periodontal bacteria have also been shown for 6\u2010 to 36\u2010month\u2010old children and their caregivers (186). A review article described horizontal transmission between spouses to be 14\u201360% for A. actinomycetemcomitans and 30\u201375% for P. gingivalis, and vertical transmission to be 30\u201360% for A. actinomycetemcomitans and to occur only rarely for P. gingivalis (197). The intrafamilial transmission of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis may in part explain the familial pattern of some types of periodontitis (13). Also, periodontal treatment and marked suppression of periodontopathic bacteria in members of a periodontitis\u2010prone family may diminish the risk of transferring the pathogens and the disease to uninfected family members.",

Repeat swabbing of teeth of young children with 10% povidone\u2010iodine can reduce the number of mutans streptococci (22) and the incidence of caries (106).

A correlation was found between salivary and subgingival levels of Epstein\u2013Barr virus in one study (48) but not in another study (84). As high quantities of salivary Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA can be recovered from fully edentulous patients (155), the occurrence of the virus in saliva may not be a reliable indicator of its subgingival level or of the periodontitis disease status. Cytomegalovirus periodontal active infection is closely linked to aggressive periodontitis (173). Cytomegalovirus DNA was detected in the saliva of 50% of periodontitis patients, but was not found in the saliva of gingivitis patients or complete denture wearers, suggesting that salivary cytomegalovirus originates mainly from periodontitis lesions (155). Also, cytomegalovirus DNA from infected breast milk appeared in the saliva of infants at 4 months of age, peaked 4\u201310 months after birth, and thereafter decreased or became undetectable (122). To sum up, a great proportion of salivary herpeviruses are shed from periodontal disease sites. As periodontal treatment can markedly reduce subgingival (73, 162) and salivary (82, 162) herpesvirus DNA counts, the establishment of a healthy periodontium may diminish the risk of intersubject herpesvirus transmission and of herpesvirus\u2010related diseases. The close relationship between some herpesvirus species and periodontitis also argues for examining the potential of using herpesvirus salivary counts to indicate periodontal disease risk.",

Approximately 10% of mononucleosis\u2010like disease is attributable to cytomegalovirus. The Epstein\u2013Barr virus infects B\u2010lymphocytes, which gives rise to the strong T\u2010lymphocyte response that is characteristic of mononucleosis. Clinical signs of infectious mononucleosis are long\u2010lasting fever, tonsillopharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, fatigue, and occasionally splenomegaly, liver involvement and pericarditis (199). Oral signs are sore throat, palatal petechiae and enlarged lymph nodes in the throat and neck. The Epstein\u2013Barr virus is transmitted through direct contact with virus\u2010infected saliva, such as with kissing, and rarely via the air or blood. Young adults with a primary Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection can rapidly clear the virus from the blood but not from the oropharynx (19).

An HIV infection is frequently associated with the salivary presence of several re\u2010activated herpesvirus species (Table 3). In the mode of synergism, herpesviruses (196), P. gingivalis (83) and other periodontal bacteria (81) may also activate a latent HIV infection. Human immunodeficiency virus\u2010infected individuals who either received or did not receive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were found to have a similar rate and quantity of oral shedding of herpes simplex virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus and cytomegalovirus (74). Subjects not on HAART exhibited a moderately higher shedding of oral herpesvirus\u20108 (33). Herpesvirus\u20108 resides in the buccal epithelial cells of HIV\u2010infected subjects (134), and can be transmitted horizontally from an HIV\u2010infected mother to her young children (66, 111) but, despite the possibility of in utero infection (28), vertical transmission of the virus is uncommon in infants born to an HIV\u2010positive mother (111). Herpesvirus\u20108 can also be transmitted by oral sex. Deep kissing was an independent risk factor (odds ratio of 5.4) for transmitting herpesvirus\u20108 from HIV\u2010seropositive men to HIV\u2010seronegative men, and the mean load of herpesvirus\u20108 DNA in saliva (4.3 log copies/ml) and pharyngeal swabs (3.1 log copies/ml) was approximately 2.5 times higher than those of genital tract samples or anal swabs (134). Taken together, the saliva of HIV\u2010infected persons is a risk factor for the transmission of several virulent herpesvirus species, and patients receiving HAART cannot be assumed to be less infectious for herpesviruses than individuals not receiving HAART.",

Hepatitis ranges pathologically from asymptomatic or mild disease to fulminant liver failure. Hepatitis A and hepatitis E viruses are transmitted by water contaminated with feces (fecal\u2013oral route), produce acute infections and do not induce a chronic carrier state. A high incidence of hepatitis A and hepatitis E viral infections occurs in countries with poor sanitary standards. Hepatitis A virus RNA was detected in the saliva of 50% of patients during a hepatitis A outbreak (11). A study in cynomolgus monkeys found that the tonsils and salivary glands acted as extrahepatic sites for early hepatitis A virus replication and constituted potential sources for saliva\u2010transmitted infection (10). Hepatitis B virus is parenterally transmitted and is frequently associated with chronic viremia. Hepatitis B virus DNA was found at concentrations of >105 copies/ml of saliva in 15% of patients with chronic hepatitis B (195). That concentration may be sufficient to permit horizontal transmission of the virus, and perhaps some of the 20% of hepatitis B patients, who contract the disease without a known origin of the infection, may have acquired the hepatitis B virus by salivary transfer (195). Chronic hepatitis C affects more than 170 million people worldwide, and the hepatitis C virus persists in 80% of the infected individuals, where it can give rise to liver inflammation, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (135), and perhaps to periodontitis, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, oral lichen planus and sialadenitis (171).

The gingival crevice fluid was identified as the major source for salivary hepatitis C virus (113). Twenty\u2010seven percent of spouses of individuals with chronic hepatitis C revealed antibodies against the virus (6), pointing to an intrafamilial, but not necessarily a sexual, mode of transmission of the virus (31). Toothbrushes used by hepatitis C patients can contain the virus and should not be utilized by other members of a family (7, 105).
