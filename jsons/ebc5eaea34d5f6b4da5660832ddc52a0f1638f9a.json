Fifty-four women with morbid obesity were included in the study. The body mass indexes (BMI) and waist/ hip ratios (WHR) of the women were calculated. Subcutaneous fat thickness was measured using a *skinfold meter, and the percentage of adipose tissue was calculated. The *Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep quality, and the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) was used to assess quality of life. In addition to routine biochemical tests, leptin, adipokine, visfatin from blood, and cortisol from saliva samples were studied. Participants were given 15 sessions of balneotherapy for 20 min each. After treatment, the laboratory and clinical parameters of the participants were *reevaluated. There was no statistically significant difference of BMI, WHR, and percentage of adipose tissue between before and after treatment measurements (p \u02c3 0.05).There was a statistically significant improvement in PSQI and NSP scores (p \u02c2 0.001). The levels of blood glucose, leptin, and visfatin were significantly decreased, and adiponectin was significantly increased after treatment (p = 0.047, p \u02c2 0.001, p \u02c2 0.001, and p \u02c2 0.001, respectively).There was no statistically significant changes in salivary cortisol levels (p = 0.848). Patients with diabetes showed a statistically significant decrease in glucose levels after treatment (p = 0.017).There was a statistically significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients with dyslipidemia compared with pretreatment (p = 0.018). Balneotherapy improves sleep and quality of life of women with morbid obesity. After balneotherapy, glucose, leptin, adiponectin, and visfatin levels may change positively.",

Obesity is classified on the basis of body mass index (BMI): a BMI > 30 kg/m 2 is considered as obesity, and a BMI > 40 kg/m 2 is considered morbid obesity (World Health Organization Obesity Technical report series No: 894 Obesity: Preventing and managing the global epidemic. 2000). Obesity, in particular morbid obesity, results in a number of serious complications, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease, disorders of the musculoskeletal system, and sleep disorders. Others, such as cancer, ischemic heart disease with myocardial infarction, or cerebral stroke, pose a serious threat to life. The last two complications are major causes of death of subjects with morbid obesity (Firszt-Adamczyk et al. 2016 ; World Health Organization Obesity Technical report series No: 894 Obesity: Preventing and managing the global epidemic. 2000). Quality of life (QoL) is an individual's assessment of their well-being and reflects physical and mental health and social relationships. In addition to all other health risks, obesity reduces QoL (Kolotkin and Andersen 2017) .",

Numerous studies have shown that it is an active endocrine organ that secretes many substances, known as adipokines, which are involved in the regulation of several metabolic and physiologic processes (Bluher and Mantzoros 2015) . In obesity, enlargement of adipose tissue has been linked to a dysregulation of adipokine secretion and adipose tissue inflammation (Fioravanti et al. 2015a) . Since the discovery of their important role, adipokines have been used in the treatment of obesity and in outcome evaluations (Francisco et al. 2019) .",

Water with a temperature above 20\u00b0C and a total mineral content exceeding 1 g/L is called thermomineral water. These waters show their effects through mechanical, chemical, and thermal routes (Fioravanti et al. 2011 ). In addition, cure-like application positively affects physiologic and homeostatic processes and creates adaptive responses in the autonomic nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, providing general well-being (Fioravanti et al. 2011; Matsumoto 2018) .",

In the study conducted by Rapoliene (Rapolien\u0117 2016) , it was shown that balneotherapy decreased the amount of body fat. Similarly, in a study by Hanh et al. (Hanh et al. 2012) , it was shown that BMI decreased after balneotherapy, and this effect lasted for 1 year. In the study conducted by Masiero et al. (Masiero et al. 2018) , it was shown that hydrokinesitherapy in thermal setting in patients with obesity may determine pain relief, joint function improvement, and walking speed increase. In some other studies, the positive effects of balneotherapy on biochemical parameters and adipokines were shown in patients with obesity (Fioravanti et al. 2015a; Jokic et al. 2018; Olah et al. 2010; Olah et al. 2011; Rosc et al. 2015) . However, there are some differences in the results of the studies. In the study conducted by Fioravanti et al., it was shown that balneotherapy decreased triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, glycemia, and serum levels of leptin and highsensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) (Fioravanti et al. 2015a) . In contradistinction, in the study conducted by Olah et al., it was shown that there was a difference between balneotherapy and control groups in post-treatment glucose level, which increased in the balneotherapy and decreased in the control group and changes from baseline of the remaining parameters (triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, CRP, etc.) of the analyzed groups were not significant at any time point of comparison (Olah et al. 2011) . In the study conducted by Rosc et al., it was shown that after balneotherapy a significant decrease in the concentration of CRP had occurred and insulin resistance (IR) was significantly reduced (Rosc et al. 2015) .",

Some studies investigated the changes of cortisol levels after balneotherapy, which is a physiologic stress marker, in healthy or sub-healthy participants (Antonelli and Donelli 2018; Toda et al. 2006) . In the study conducted by Toda et al., saliva samples were collected immediately before and after spa bathing from 12 healthy males, and it was shown that salivary cortisol levels decreased after spa bathing (Toda et al. 2006 ). In a review paper written by Antonelli and Donelli; main findings suggest that balneotherapy may have the potential to influence cortisol levels in healthy subjects in such a way as to improve stress resilience. Spa therapy with or without included mud/peloid therapy demonstrated the same potential to influence cortisol levels also in sub-healthy subjects (Antonelli and Donelli 2018) .",

In the present study, the effect of the balneotherapy in the treatment of obesity was investigated. The results show that balneotherapy may cause some changes in some laboratory and clinical parameters of participants with morbid obesity, although the short-term assessments showed no effect on BMI, WHR, or body fat percentage. Some studies showing a decrease in BMI after balneotherapy are available in the literature. However, in some of these studies, dietary therapy was used in addition to balneotherapy treatment (Fioravanti et al. 2015a; Rosc et al. 2015) . Therefore, it is difficult to say whether this effect belonged only to balneotherapy. In another study conducted by Rapoliene, the enrolled patients only received balneotherapy, and it was shown that BMI and body fat content were decreased after 15 balneotherapy sessions, and this effect was shown to continue after 4 months (Rapolien\u0117 2016) . The failure to detect a statistically significant change in BMI, WHR, and body fat percentage in the present study may be related to the fact that the second evaluation of the study was performed immediately after the end of treatment.",

The adipocytes or adipose tissue macrophages produce adipokines which induce a low-grade chronic inflammatory state that could play a central role in obesity-related cardiovascular complications and insulin resistance (Antuna-Puente et al. 2008 ). In the present study, some adipokine levels were examined, including leptin, adiponectin, and visfatin. Leptin acts as a signaling molecule of metabolic status and mediates some metabolic processes (energy homeostasis, neuroendocrine functions, etc.). Hyperleptinemia and leptin resistance are closely associated with type 2 DM. Indeed, lower circulating leptin levels are associated with improved insulin sensitivity and inflammation (Ghadge and Khaire 2019; Ragino et al. 2020) . In the patients with obesity, the concentration of leptin in plasma is markedly increased and correlates with body fat mass (Matarese et al. 2007; Chait and den Hartigh 2020) . It is thought that leptin may be an important mediator between obesity and the development of cardiovascular diseases (Ragino et al. 2020; Landecho et al. 2019) .",

In patients with morbid obesity, circulating levels of adiponectin are mostly low and decrease after weight gain, which induce insulin sensitivity. In fact, adiponectin stimulates glucose uptake via increasing the fatty acid oxidation and reducing the glucose synthesis in the liver and works as an endogenous insulin sensitizer (Francisco et al. 2019) . Adiponectin protects vascular endothelium against atherogenic inflammation through multiple effects on the endothelium, so it is a potent anti-atherogenic factor (Lago et al. 2007 ). Adiponectin deficiency is related with coronary artery disease and hypertension. In addition, adiponectin plays a role in preventing metabolic and cardiovascular disease (Liang and Ye 2019). Visfatin is an adipokine that is increased in obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 DM, and other pro-inflammatory states. It is responsible for the endothelial dysfunction that may cause progression of atherosclerosis. So, it becomes a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (Liang and Ye 2019; Ragino et al. 2020; Landecho et al. 2019) .",

However, in the present study, there was no statistically significant change in cortisol levels, which may be related to the unhealthy state of morbid obesity. Sleep is seen as an important variable of health that affects the individual's QoL and well-being. Adequate sleep is important for the renewal of the body, good functioning of brain functions, energy storage, good appearance, and protection against diseases. It has been determined that sleep time and quality of sleep affect memory, learning, performance, and metabolic and endocrine systems (G\u00f6kta\u015f et al. 2015) . A decrease in sleep time causes an increase in weight gain and obesity by disrupting the neurohormonal balance (Noh 2018) . As a vicious circle, sleep disorders are very common in patients with obesity due to the morbidity of some obesity-related systemic diseases and also due to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (World Health Organization Obesity Technical report series No: 894 Obesity: Preventing and managing the global epidemic. 2000; G\u00f6kta\u015f et al. 2015) . In a study conducted by Yang et al., it was shown that balneotherapy relieved mental stress, sleep disorders, and general health problems in sub-healthy people. In the present study, the sleep quality of the participants, as evaluated using the PSQI, was found to be very low before treatment. The improvement in scores after treatment shows that balneotherapy is effective for the sleep disorders of patients with obesity.",

Although the participants in the present study did not lose weight, positive wellbeing was observed after the treatment in all subsections of NHP scores indicating QoL. In the literature, improvements have been shown in parameters such as stress, fatigue, and poor perception of general health after balneotherapy in some Rapoliene et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2018 ).

However, because normal values of anthropometric measurements and laboratory values are already known, a healthy control group without obesity was not included. The second limitation of this study was that only the short-term efficacy of balneotherapy was evaluated and there were no long-term outcomes. Studies including long-term results are needed to assess the sustainability of treatment effects. The third limitation was the lack of an evaluation of body composition using ultrasonography, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, or bioimpedance analysis. Body composition was evaluated using only simple measurements such as BMI, WHR, and total body fat percentage ratio. If a more advanced technological method had been used, a difference in body fat distribution might have been shown. The fourth limitation was the use of a single treatment method. The fifth limitation was that the sample size was not calculated before starting the study. Another limitation is that it was conducted only on women. We recommend for the future studies to have comparisons with other treatment methods (e.g., diet, exercise, tap water) and having long-term outcomes involving participants of both sexes.",
