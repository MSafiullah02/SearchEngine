            "text": "Captive cheetahs have been affected by a variety of diseases limiting the sustainability of these populations. To better understand these captive cheetah diseases on a global scale and determine if they impact wild cheetahs, several long-term studies have been conducted (Munson, 1993, Munson et al., 1999, Munson et al., 2005). As a species, cheetahs are considered more susceptible to disease than other carnivores and are carefully managed in captivity (Chapter 24). Thoughts over the causes of disease susceptibility in captive cheetahs have changed over time as new research has been conducted. This chapter will discuss the evolution in our understanding of cheetah diseases and provide details on some of the most significant diseases affecting captive and wild cheetahs.

            "text": "Research from the 1980s had suggested that reduced genetic diversity (Chapter 6) may be the cause of poor health in captivity and high neonatal mortality rates. It was hypothesized that the lack of heterogeneity at major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci (loci which encode peptides that mediate immune responses to pathogens) was an important factor in a feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) epidemic in one captive population, and it was assumed that cheetahs could be particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases (Evermann et al., 1988). However, in the 1990s, aspects of captive management were shown to affect juvenile mortality (Wielebnowski, 1996), and pathology studies indicated that morbidity and mortality in captive cheetah populations were predominately due to degenerative rather than infectious diseases (Munson, 1993, Munson et al., 1999). Study of wild Namibian cheetahs, a primary source for many founders of captive populations, indicated that these diseases were absent or extremely rare in the wild (Munson et al., 2005). Serology and pathology surveys showed that wild cheetahs were exposed to a wide range of viral pathogens without evident associated disease (Munson et al., 2004a, Munson et al., 2004b, Munson et al., 2005, Thalwitzer et al., 2010). Together, these studies suggest that environmental factors, such as captivity-induced stress, are of equal or greater importance than genetic factors in the development of disease in captive cheetahs (Munson et al., 2005).",

Captive cheetahs have larger adrenal glands and higher baseline levels of corticoids than wild cheetahs (Terio et al., 2004; Chapter 7). These persistently elevated corticoids can have profound negative effects on many physiological functions, including metabolism, reproductive health, and immune responses. Corticoids can alter immune responses by affecting transcription of mediators that coordinate and determine the type of immune responses (e.g., cytokines and inflammatory mediators). Comparison of these mediators between captive and free-ranging cheetahs has demonstrated that captive, but not free-ranging, cheetahs have decreased expression of TH1-type cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IFN\u03b3) consistent with elevated corticoids (Terio and Munson, 2005). Because TH1-type cytokines are important in cell-mediated immune responses, stress-induced immune modulation may be associated with the unusual inflammatory reactions observed in captive cheetahs in response to common pathogens.",

Gastritis, one of the major cheetah diseases in captivity (see section, \u201cHelicobacter-Associated Gastritis\u201d), has been associated with increased stress levels and has served as a model to study stress in captivity. In cheetahs, severe gastritis correlates with high individual temperament scores for the adjectives \u201ceccentric\u201d and \u201ceasy to work with.\u201d Cheetahs with severe gastritis are also more likely to have been exposed to suspected environmental stressors, such as small enclosures, high density of cheetahs, movement to multiple institutions over an individual\u2019s lifetime, and high amounts of exposure to the public. In contrast, gastritis severity is negatively correlated with \u201cexcitable\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d temperaments, a behavioral phenotype more often seen in wild-caught cheetahs. A negative correlation with \u201caggressive\u201d is also noted with corticoid concentrations. Cheetahs with opportunities for exercise (running on a lure) have lower fecal glucocorticoid concentrations (Terio et al., 2014), supporting the importance of regular exercise for captive cheetahs.",

Most outbreaks can be linked to contaminated carcasses fed to captive animals or concurrent outbreaks in other wildlife. Affected cheetahs may have increased respiratory rate and effort and can vomit (J\u00e4ger et al., 1990). Similar to other carnivores, cheetahs may have ventral and cervical edema, bloody nasal discharge, scleral congestion, and pulmonary edema (Good et al., 2008; J\u00e4ger et al., 1990). Serosurveys after an anthrax outbreak in Botswana found that only 1 of 16 potentially exposed cheetahs had antibodies (Good et al., 2008) and cheetahs in Namibia also do not have antibodies to anthrax (Switzer et al., 2016). These results support claims that cheetahs are susceptible because they have low levels of exposure (as they generally do not scavenge), thus infection is often fatal (Lindeque et al., 1998). Vaccination may be of benefit for certain high-risk populations as cheetahs do mount a potentially protective response to a commercially available anthrax vaccine (Turnbull et al., 2004).",

Although gastric colonization with Helicobacter sp. can be confirmed using the urea breath test, antemortem diagnosis of gastritis requires histologic evaluation of endoscopic biopsies (Chapter 24).

In cheetahs, the distribution of T lymphocytes (T cells) and diffuse upregulation of MHC II expression on gastric epithelium are qualitatively similar to that in other species infected with Helicobacter (Terio et al., 2011). What distinguishes cheetahs with severe gastritis from those with mild disease are large numbers of activated B cells (CD79a+ CD21\u2212) and plasma cells (Fig. 25.1B) which may be due to alterations in the Th1:Th2 cytokine balance and stress-induced modulation of the immune system (Terio et al., 2011).",

Some lesions progress to fibrosis (scarring) and gastric atrophy that limits the ability of cheetahs to eat and digest a complete meal in one sitting (Citino and Munson, 2005, Terio et al., 2011). Although treatment with antibiotic triple therapy may provide short-term decrease in inflammation and eradication of Helicobacter, none of the treatments evaluated to date have had a significant effect on long-term Helicobacter infection or the lifelong progression of inflammation (Citino and Munson, 2005, Lane et al., 2004, Wack et al., 1997). The use of triple therapies may also impact the gut microbiome and potentially predispose to other conditions. Therefore, antibiotic treatment is recommended only in severely affected or symptomatic cheetahs. Diet may contribute to and or ameliorate signs of gastritis, but there are contradictory results on the impact of diet on gastritis severity (Lane et al., 2012, Whitehouse-Tedd et al., 2015).\n",

Serology alone cannot be used to confirm infection (Witte et al., 2013). Biopsy is essential to differentiate proliferative skin lesions from neoplasms (tumors). Histologically, dense infiltrates of eosinophils and mast cells are present in the dermis, and the intact epithelium adjacent to the ulcer may be hyperplastic with viral inclusions (Munson et al., 2004a, Munson et al., 2004b). Treatment for mild FHV-1 is supportive. Administration of l-lysine and famcyclovir have been helpful in some cases, while skin lesions often require cryotherapy. Vaccination is recommended, although variable responses have been noted in cheetahs and natural exposure is not uncommon (Spencer and Burroughs, 1992, Wack et al., 1993; Chapter 24).",

In these studies, cheetah cells (lymphocytes and monocytes) as a group had a significantly lower proliferative response to FHV-1 than domestic cats, although individual responses varied widely. Interestingly, cheetah cellular responses improved when they were first cultured with interleukin-2 (IL-2), a TH-1 cytokine critical to an effective cell-mediated immune response. As previously discussed, low levels of IL-2 have been found in captive but not wild cheetahs (Terio et al., 2005), suggesting that ineffective immune responses, possibly due to stress-induced suppression, may play a role. Disease tends to be more severe if cubs are infected by their dams at a young age (<3 weeks). As cubs at this age should still have maternal antibodies, this finding suggests inadequate colostral antibodies against herpesvirus. Often, these cubs are also more likely to have recurrent lesions throughout their lives.",

In 1983, there was an epidemic of FIP in a captive cheetah population with >60% mortality that resulted in stringent testing and quarantine measures to limit the spread of disease within the North American captive cheetah population (Heeney et al., 1990). Complicating attempts to control spread of the disease was a lack of concordance between serology and PCR identification of virus from feces (Kennedy et al., 2001, Munson and Citino, 2005). Some cheetahs have been found to shed the virus only intermittently to rarely; therefore, captive populations are now managed as endemically infected (Gaffney et al., 2012, Munson and Citino, 2005).",

Canine parvovirus type 2b has also been identified in cheetahs with chronic diarrhea due to chronic necrotizing enteritis (Steinel et al., 2000). None of these cheetahs had concurrent leukopenia. Molecular phylogeny of outbreaks of FPLV in South Africa has indicated the presence of more than one strain of the virus in captive cheetahs and other felids (Lane et al., 2016). As non-domestic species may be reservoirs of parvoviruses and these viruses readily change host specificity, the risks of FPLV transmission between captive bred and free-ranging carnivores, and domestic cats and dogs, warrants further research. Salmonella infection, including Salmonella typhimurium, is another potential cause of diarrhea, especially in cheetahs fed poultry or horsemeat (Venter et al., 2003). Complicating interpretation of positive fecal cultures are high rates of fecal shedding in seemingly healthy felids fed raw diets (Clyde et al., 1997).",

Amyloidosis can be due to a genetic predisposition (protein sequence that is more likely to precipitate) or secondary to increased production of SAA which occurs in chronic inflammation or neoplasia. Previous studies identified concurrent inflammation in 100% of the cheetahs with amyloidosis; however, not all cheetahs with inflammation develop amyloidosis. Studies of the amyloid fibrils suggest that these deposits are due to deposition of the full serum amyloid A (SAA) protein, as well as truncated fragments (Bergstr\u00f6m et al., 2006, Johnson et al., 1997). Studies of the cheetah AA protein sequence have found it to be similar to those of domestic cats with familial amyloidosis, suggesting a possible genetic predisposition (Chen et al., 2012, Johnson et al., 1997). A genetic role for increased production of the SAA protein was proposed (Zhang et al., 2008b). Subsequent studies, however, have determined that while specific genetic variants were associated with differing SAA serum concentrations, there was no significant association with disease (Franklin et al., 2016). To date, amyloidosis has not been described in a free-ranging cheetah (Munson et al., 2005; Terio and Mitchell, unpublished data).",

Damage to renal glomeruli consists of thickening of basement membranes due to deposition of collagen, glycoproteins, and advanced glycosylation end products (Bolton and Munson, 1999). Glomerular damage leads to renal inflammation and scarring. The severity and prevalence of glomerulosclerosis increases with age, but there is no sex predilection. Clinically, affected cheetahs have signs of renal disease and, eventually, failure with proteinuria due to leakage through damaged glomeruli. Treatment is supportive. Feeding diets formulated for renal disease or commercial cat diets rather than raw meat may provide some clinical improvement, particularly in serum urea nitrogen (Lane et al., 2012). The cause of glomerulosclerosis is not known. Histologically, lesions resemble that of a diabetic nephropathy, although most affected cheetahs are not diabetic.

Interestingly, VOD has not been reported in the European captive population (Kotsch et al., 2002). Elevated dietary levels of vitamin A may cause VOD, but findings have been inconsistent (Gosselin et al., 1988). A few wild cheetahs have been diagnosed with VOD which seems to refute the hypothesis that captive diets are causative (Munson et al., 2005). Clinical pathology studies of trapped wild cheetahs have documented elevations in hepatic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase) within the first week of captivity, which could be the result of hepatocellular damage associated with VOD (Munson and Marker, 1997). One hypothesis is that catecholamine release due to the severe acute stress of capture leads to shunting of blood from the liver and hypoxic damage.

The disease emerged in the last 20 years and has limited growth of the European captive cheetah population (Walzer et al., 2003). To date, more than 100 cases have been identified in at least 16 different locations in Europe and the United Arab Emirates, resulting in euthanasia of many cheetahs in breeding programs. There is no apparent sex predilection. All affected cheetahs have been captive bred in European, Middle Eastern, or South African institutions from captive-born or wild-caught parents, belonging to the southern African subspecies (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) or northeastern African subspecies (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii). Onset of ataxia ranges from 2.5 months to 12 years, is usually acute, and can occur spontaneously or following a stressful experience for the individual or for the litter. In cubs, clinical signs are often temporally associated with sneezing and ocular discharge typical of FHV-1 infection. The course of the disease is variable; ataxia and paresis may develop rapidly to hind limb dragging or recumbency, or progress slowly and stabilize for several months or years, with possible acute relapsing episodes. Pathologically, the disease is characterized by bilateral symmetrical degeneration of the white matter of the spinal cord, with loss of myelin exceeding axonal loss, suggesting a primary myelin disorder (Robert and Walzer, 2009). The etiology is unknown, but several causes have been considered (Burger et al., 2004, Palmer et al., 2001, Shibly et al., 2006, Walzer et al., 2003).

Affected cheetahs were older (median and mean age of 12 years) and presented with ataxia and suspected blindness, leading to inability to follow keepers and locate food. Neurological signs included progressive altered behavior, disorientation, proprioceptive deficits, and, in some cases, seizures. Anesthesia in affected cheetahs was complicated by the need for increased doses of anesthetic agents and prolonged recoveries. Magnetic resonance imaging identified areas with white matter loss and hydrocephalus. Corresponding lesions were observed at necropsy. Testing for possible viruses and epidemiological evaluations failed to identify any potential etiologies. Cases increased with a peak of 22 cases in 1998 after which case numbers declined. No cases have been identified since 2005.",

Affected cheetahs develop acute renal failure due to tubular damage. Crystals can be noted in the urine antemortem. No correlation with other common cheetah diseases has been noted, so genetic and/or dietary causes are targets of ongoing investigations.

In some wild and captive cheetahs, corresponding depressions are accompanied with mucosal lesions (Fitch and Fagan, 1982). In severe cases, the palatine bone is perforated resulting in communication between the oral and nasal cavities. Both mild and severe lesions were initially coined Focal Palatine Erosion (FPE). When first identified, the soft nature of captive diets and absence of exposure to tougher dietary items like skin and bones were presumed to play a role in the pathogenesis (Phillips et al., 1993). However, studies in Namibia found that over 40% of wild cheetahs had deep palatine depressions with perforation of the palate in 15.3%, suggesting that captive diets are not causative (Marker and Dickman, 2004). In this study, wild cheetahs with FPE were also more likely to have crowded lower incisors and absent upper premolars. Studies of museum skulls identified only rare cases in free-ranging East African cheetahs, suggesting that FPE may be more common in the Namibian population (Zordan et al., 2012).",

Bilateral carpal valgus deformities that may require surgical repair have been noted in captive cheetahs at multiple facilities (Allan et al., 2008, Bell et al., 2011). In these cases, cubs presented with lameness around 6 months of age or during weaning. Keeping hand-reared kittens on formula too long may predispose to this condition; adding meat early (e.g., 3 weeks) and weaning by 5-6 weeks can be preventative. Excess dietary calcium can inhibit cartilage maturation and contribute to osteochondrosis, an underlying cause of these deformities (Allan et al., 2008). In some cases, however, affected cheetahs were fed the same diet as unaffected littermates, suggesting that other factors may also be involved (Bell et al., 2011). Fractures have also been reported in some cheetahs, especially in king cheetahs, after minimal trauma, raising concerns about inappropriate dietary mineral content.",

            "text": "Much of our understanding of disease in cheetahs comes from long-term pathology surveys of cheetahs in captivity and in the wild. As many of the diseases of cheetahs occur primarily in captivity, it is incumbent upon us to better understand and reduce risk factors that lead to this higher prevalence of disease in captive settings. Using death codes reported in the International Studbook from 1980 to 2009, the relative prevalence of reported infectious disease decreased from 50% to less than 25%, suggesting improvements in infectious disease management (Schmidt-K\u00fcntzel et al., in preparation). Excluding infectious, accidental, and congenital causes, diseases impacting the urinary system have been increasing from less than 20% in 1980\u201384 to over 45% of cases from 2005 to 2009. This likely reflects increasing longevity of the captive cheetah population, with a corresponding increase in chronic renal disease, a common cause of death in many domestic and wild aged felids. Unfortunately, some diseases continue to be intractable. Continued research into management is important not only for improved well-being and medical management of captive populations, but also in limiting development of disease in wild-caught cheetahs that are held in captive settings, either temporarily or permanently, due to human-wildlife conflict (Chapter 13) or other reasons. Although previous studies of wild cheetahs have found them to be generally healthy, it is known that they have exposure to many of the infectious agents that can cause problems in captive cheetahs. It is also possible that pressures including reduced size and quality of free-ranging cheetah habitats (Chapter 10), increased contact with domesticated animals, and climate change (Chapter 12) could change disease dynamics. Continued monitoring of both captive and free-ranging cheetah populations, especially small geographically isolated populations and an improved understanding of normal clinical values, is needed for understanding and management of disease risks to species survival.",
