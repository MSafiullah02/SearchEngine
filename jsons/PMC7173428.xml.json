This initially led to several attempts to divide the group. In the early 1990s, the availability of genomic sequences led to the splitting of the group to separate the trichoviruses from the true closteroviruses. Due to their localization in the phloem and the difficulties in particle purification, closteroviruses have traditionally been a genus which, with few exceptions, has attracted relatively little attention. However, recent years have seen a remarkable increase in the number of publications on closteroviruses. This can probably be explained by two factors: the significant improvement brought to these studies by the introduction of molecular biology techniques, and the emergence of a number of \u2018new\u2019 closteroviruses, apparently linked to the explosion of insect vector populations. As a result, characterization and sequence data are now accumulating at a rapid rate.\nThis has already led to a further splitting of the\nClosterovirus genus, in order to accommodate in a separate taxon the species with a divided genome (Crinivirus). The two genera (Closterovirus and Crinivirus) are now included in the recently created Closteroviridae family.",

For some viruses ( BYV, citrus tristeza virus (CTV), LIYV, beet yellows stunt virus (BYSV), little cherry virus (LChV)), two types of coat protein (CP) subunits have been identified: the genuine CP and a CP homologue that probably arose by gene duplication. With BYV and CTV, the duplicate protein coats an extremity of the virions, forming a distinct structure, for which the terms \u2018rattlesnake\u2019 or \u2018heterodimeric\u2019 have been coined.

The downstream ORF 1b encodes a 48 kDa putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POL), which is probably expressed via a +1 ribosomal frameshifting, as a 348 kDa ORF 1a/1b fusion protein. ORF 2 encodes a 6.4 kDa protein with membrane-binding properties, homologous to the small hydrophobic proteins of potex- and carlaviruses. ORF 3 codes for a 65 kDa homologue of the cellular\nHSP 70 heat shock proteins. The proteins of this family are molecular chaperones found in all cell types, and are implicated in protein\u2013protein interactions. The 65 kDa protein of BYV has ATPase activity associated with the conserved N-terminal domain. However, it apparently lacks the ability to interact with unfolded protein chains, another property typical of cellular HSP 70 proteins. Recent experimental work indicates that this protein is essential for cell-to-cell movement of the virus. ORF 4 overlaps ORF 3 and encodes a 64 kDa protein with sequence similarity to proteins of the HSP 90 family of heat shock proteins. ORFs 6 and 5 code for the capsid protein (22 kDa) and its diverged duplicate (24 kDa), respectively.

The second block is the five-gene module. Outside of these modules, other genes in CTV and BYV differ.

However, LIYV is distinct from monopartite closteroviruses in several ways: its genome consists of two RNAs; the order of the capsid protein gene and the gene for its diverged copy is reversed as compared to BYV and CTV (the same is also observed in the mealybug-transmitted LChV, GLRaV-3 and in the whitefly-transmitted sweet potato sunken vein virus (SPSVV)). The diverged copy (52 kDa) is also much larger than the CP (28 kDa) and could be the result of a triplication of the CP gene, with the CP gene followed by two fused, highly diverged duplicates.

In all members of the family for which sufficient information is available, the POL domain is encoded by a separate ORF overlapping with the 3\u2032-terminal portion of the large upstream ORF, including the MT and HEL domains. It has been suggested that both ORFs are expressed as a large fusion protein resulting from a +1 ribosomal frameshifting. Such a +1 ribosomal frameshifting is a unique feature among positive-strand plant viruses. In vitro translation experiments have demonstrated the autocatalytic cleavage of the N-terminal portion of the ORF 1a product of BYV that contains the papain-like proteinase domain. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of the predicted catalytic amino acid residues abolished the proteolysis, thus corroborating the identity of the protease. With BYV, CTV, BYSV and LIYV, the products of the ORFs downstream, ORFs 1a and 1b, are expressed via the formation of a nested set of 3\u2032-coterminal subgenomic RNAs (sgRNA).\nTherefore, the genome expression of these viruses (and likely of all members of the family) is based on polyprotein processing, translational frameshifting and multiple sgRNA generation, thus resembling that of coronaviruses.

In the cell, the molecular chaperones of the HSP 70 family perform several functions, including protein folding, protein trafficking and secretion. Like some HSP 70 proteins, the 65 kDa protein of BYV binds to microtubules in vitro, this binding being stimulated by ATP hydrolysis. Several functions have been postulated for this HSP 70 homologue: mediation of cell-to-cell movement through plasmodesmata via interactions with the cellular translocation machinery (such as cytoskeletal or secretional proteins); involvement in the assembly of multisubunit complexes for genome replication and/or subgenomic RNA synthesis, or assembly of viral particles. Recent evidence, showing that BYV mutants in which the expression of the HSP 70 protein is abolished are restricted to inoculated cells, demonstrates the role of this protein in cell-to-cell movement of the virus.",

Two types of inclusions are observed: aggregates of virions and membranous vesicles, or combinations of the two. Virions occur either in crossbanded aggregates made up of stacked tiers of particles packed side by side, or in loose wavy paracrystalline aggregates, or, more typically, in irregular bundles intermingled with single or clustered membranous vesicles containing a network of fine fibrils.\nInclusion of the latter kind are one of the hallmarks of members of the Closteroviridae, and are often referred to as BYV-type inclusion bodies. They are limited to the phloem of infected cells, i.e. sieve tubes, companion cells and phloem parenchyma, but occasionally, as with BYV, can also be found in the mesophyll and epidermis near local lesions.

In many cases, the mode of transmission or the vector has not been determined (Table 1). Studies have mostly dealt with aphid transmission of BYV and CTV. Information on the transmission of other viruses is still very limited and, in many instances, transmission has only been demonstrated under laboratory conditions. In the case of BYV, CTV and other closteroviruses, aphid transmission is semipersistent, i.e. long acquisition and transmission periods (minimum feeding time for acquisition and transmission in the range of 15 and 30 min, respectively), relatively long retention of the virus (up to 2\u20133 days) and absence of a latency period. The virus does not appear to be retained through molts or to be transmitted to the vector progeny. In general, relatively short acquisition or transmission feeding periods result in lower efficiency of transmission, this being correlated with the length of these periods (up to 24 h for acquisition, up to 6 h for transmission). The molecular bases of the semipersistent mode of aphid transmission are currently not understood. In particular, the localization of virions in viruliferous aphids is not known, nor are the reasons for the long retention period. On the other hand, the close association of the viruses with phloem tissues accounts for some of the transmission characteristics, such as the length of the acquisition and transmission feeding periods and the lack of transmission during brief probings. One hypothesis, which remains to be verified, is that the CP duplicate may facilitate the interaction between virions and the insect's foregut.",

The name \u2018tristeza\u2019 is derived from a condition leading to a quick decline of sweet orange and numerous other commercial citrus species grafted on sour orange rootstocks, a symptom due to a scion\u2013rootstock combination problem, with no decline appearing on plants grafted on tolerant rootstock. The most devastating disease induced by CTV is probably stem pitting of a number of citrus species, such as grapefruits, some sweet orange varieties, and sour and sweet limes. Stem pitting is usually accompanied by loss of plant vigour, decline and reduced fruit size. Other major types of diseases caused by CTV include vein clearing of sour lime and seedling yellows, a severe stunting disorder developed by some varieties when infected at an early stage. The pattern of symptoms induced by CTV is complicated by large differences in species and varietal susceptibility and by the existence of an extremely large biological variability between CTV strains.",

In documented cases of severe LIYV infection, losses of up to 80% have been reported from southwestern USA. Epidemic virus outbreaks have been estimated to induce, in a single season, losses of lettuce, sugarbeet, melon and squash worth $US8 million. The recently observed increase in the impact of these viruses appears to be directly linked to the explosion of whitefly vector populations during the last few years, which may have been favoured by a number of factors, i.e. the widespread use of synthetic organic insecticides, resistance to pesticides, changing climatic conditions, intensified agricultural practices and international distribution of plant material contaminated by whitefly populations.",

In infected areas, infections can be controlled through the production and use of virus-free propagative material, along with control of insect vector populations and destruction of virus reservoirs. When possible, these measures can be coupled with the use of resistant or tolerant varieties or rootstocks.

As molecular data has accumulated, the taxonomy of this formerly heterogeneous group of viruses, previously based on morphological criteria, has evolved towards more phylogenetically based groupings. In some crops, such as grapevine, new viruses continue to be discovered. At the same time, in the western USA, an explosion of the whitefly populations and establishment of the new species B. argentifolii, has led to the discovery of several new diseases and viruses. Comprising both very old diseases of high incidence and emerging viruses, the field of closterovirology is rapidly becoming a very active and dynamic research area. The recent development of synthetic inocula using cDNA clones from several of these viruses offers new opportunities for the understanding of the relationships with their hosts and vectors. At the same time, molecular biology techniques have greatly improved our ability to detect and characterize these viruses, which should rapidly translate into increased capability to fight the diseases they cause.",
