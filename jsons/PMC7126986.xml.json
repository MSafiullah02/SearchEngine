In segment 4 of the virus, there was a more close relation with two serotype 2 strains isolated in Tunisia or Italy, respectively (98.8% sequence similarity). Based on the evidence, it was suggested that the causal strain of the outbreak was a reassortant strain with genome segments from lineages of serotype 1, 2 and 4 (Mertens et al., 2014).

The first cases were diagnosed clinically in mid-August 2014. In all flocks, appropriate laboratory tests (competitive ELISA and/or RT-PCR) confirmed bluetongue caused by a serotype 4 strain of the virus. In these flocks with a total population of 560 sheep, 155 clinical cases were recorded, hence a morbidity rate of 27.5% (Table 3\n), which was significantly higher (P\n < 0.001) than the overall morbidity rate reported throughout Greece (Table 1).",

Other measures that were implemented to limit the disease in flocks with affected sheep were the extended housing of affected animals, the provision of high-energy, soft type feeds and the regular external application of insect repellents. In fact, occasionally, some animals recovered fully from the disease (Vasileiou and Fthenakis, 2014).",

Further, no evidence of haemolysis (e.g., schistocytes) was observed, while the total bilirubin concentration was within the normal range.

In total, 19 samples, 13 from the Koziakas hunting area and 6 from the Serres hunting area (Fig. 3\n) were tested for presence of Bluetongue Virus RNA, by using RT-PCR. In total, three samples collected in the Koziakas hunting area were found positive. Subsequently, presence of Bluetongue virus nucleic acid was confirmed by sequencing. In the general area, where samples were collected, there were 44,215 sheep and goats in 478 farms, as well as 5,949 cattle (Chatzopoulos et al., 2015a). The results of that study indicated the exposure of roe deer to Bluetongue Virus in Greece and confirmed the implication of wildlife species in the outbreak currently ongoing in the country (Chatzopoulos et al., 2015a).",

Unfortunately however, this approach did not limit expansion of the disease to other regions of Greece, well beyond the area of the initial outbreak, as well as to neighbouring countries. Similar approaches were undertaken by other countries in the region (bar Turkey). Ultimately, the disease had spread widely and significantly, over 1500 km from the initial outbreak in southern Peloponnese to northern Romania and Hungary (World Organisation for Animal Health, 2014), favoured by the warm weather conditions, which supported flight activity of the vectors and the consequent transmission of the virus.

            "text": "During field work, clinical anaemia has been often recorded in affected animals, which was characterised as macrocytic, hypochromic, regenerative and non-haemolytic. Clinical anaemia had rarely been reported as associated with the disease. In the past, only Balaro et al. (2014) have reported this finding in cases of the disease caused by serotype 4 of the virus. In fact, Dercksen and Lewis (2007) have described that absence of anaemia can be used diagnostically for clinical differentiation of bluetongue from other diseases manifested with oedema in the head, e.g., H. contortus or F. hepatica infections. As this outbreak seems to have been caused by a novel, reassortant strain of the virus (Mertens et al., 2014), the findings confirm the many clinical facets of the disorder, which may differ accordingly to the causative serotype or even strain of the virus. Presence of macrocytic erythrocytes with no other evidence of regenerative anaemia has been described in horses or cats (Thrall, 2004). In the latter species, the findings have been associated with potential viral effect on bone marrow (Munoz, 2005); indeed, Bluetongue virus has been found to be able to destroy haemopoetic stem cells (Rodriguez-Calvo et al., 2014). Findings in such cases would be compatible with the results of haematological tests (Vasileiou et al., 2015). This would also explain absence of all other findings related to regenerative anaemia (e.g., polychromasia). Moreover, the virus causes endothelial injury (Maclachlan et al., 2009): changes in affected vessels include endothelial hypertrophy with perivascular oedema and/or mild haemorrhages, which would further account for the reduced number of erythrocytes. Maclachlan et al. (2009) expressed the opinion that, possibly, Bluetongue virus may have similarities with viruses causing haemorrhagic diseases (e.g., Ebola virus) in causing endothelial damage and vascular injury and damage. Possibly, the extent of these lesions can be accentuated by release of host-mediated vasoactive molecules, as has been reported in other haemorrhagic viral diseases (Hoenen et al., 2006, Aleksandrowicz et al., 2008).",

In general, this organism is considered to be an opportunistic pathogen, which causes clinical disease under particular circumstances (e.g., in immunocompromised individuals). The organism exerts its pathogenic action after aggregative adherence onto the gastrointestinal mucosa, where it multiplies. In general, mechanisms of infection are similar to those of enteropathogenic strains of E. coli (Bai et al., 2012); production of Shiga-like and/or heat stable toxins by some strains has also been reported (Guarino et al., 1987). C. freundii may also invade into the central nervous system, leading to development of neurological signs by affected individuals, but the relevant mechanisms are not fully understood, although it has been suggested that they were related to blood-brain barrier permeability and intracellular proliferation; the organism has a predilection for the meninges, which explains the characteristic neurological signs (Badger et al., 1999).",

However, the main financial losses in cases of bovine bluetongue are caused by the significant reduction of milk production, as has been recorded during the outbreak in Greece by Chouzouris et al.

Wild deer, especially red deer, which is most relevant to Bluetongue virus infections, presents several features, due to which, they might be appropriate host of the virus (Chapman et al., 1993, Grego et al., 2014). Red deer live in populations with increased density and often at the same altitude with livestock. They are animals larger than sheep or goats, with life habits and feeding habitats similar to domesticated small ruminants, hence exposed to bites of insects (Acevedo et al., 2008, Apollonio et al., 2010). Therefore, they can be infected to a similar extent as domestic ruminants, which indicates that systematic surveillance can be significant for monitoring and prediction of possible re-emergence. These findings also point out to a requirement to change surveillance of the disease. In fact, bluetongue has been confirmed in wild cervids prior to diagnosing it in domestic ruminant species (Garcia et al., 2009, Lorca-Oro et al., 2011), a finding that may be used as an early marker of an upcoming outbreak. In endemic regions, seropositivity rates in wild cervids were similar to those in domestic ruminants (Ruiz-Fons et al., 2014).",
