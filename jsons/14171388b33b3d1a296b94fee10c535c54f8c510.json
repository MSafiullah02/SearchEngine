            "text": "evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first emerged in southern China in late 2002. It spread suddenly and quickly with a high mortality rate and resulted in a global outbreak in the year that followed. First-line treatment protocols that were used clinically, for instance, ribavirin and steroid, were fairly limited in terms of effectiveness. 1,2 A preliminary study suggests that interferon-a plus steroids may be of value in the treatment of SARS. 3 Treatment with convalescent plasma [4] [5] [6] suggested that passive immunity is an effective approach specific for SARS, as observed in other deadly infectious diseases including Ebola. 7 Superiorly, preparation of virus-inactivated, purified, and concentrated hyperimmune globulins from pooled convalescent plasma minimizes the risk of transmission of blood-borne viruses, enhances the polyvalency of neutralizing antibodies, and increases product consistency. 8, 9 To develop such SARS hyperimmune globulins for intravenous (IV) injection, a combination of Cohn fractionation 10 and ion-exchange chromatography was employed in this study to process convalescent plasma. The virus inactivation and removal approaches that have been widely adopted in the plasma fractionation industry, the solvent/detergent (S/D) technology 11 , and nanofiltra-S tion, were used to ensure the safety of both employees and the final product. The SARS hyperimmune globulins prepared were subsequently approved to go into clinical trials by the Chinese National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical & Biological Products (NICPBP).",

RNA was extracted from the SARS hyperimmune globulins and subsequently tested with a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS virus-specific nucleic acid. 14 Two-hundred nanograms of RNA was used in each PCR procedure, and proper negative, positive, and spiking controls were included. All analysis required for IV immune globulin (IVIG) was performed according to the Chinese Requirements for Biologics. Briefly, purity was determined by cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis, monomer-dimer levels by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), prekallikrein activator (PKA) levels by spectrophotometric measurement of peptide cleavage, anticomplementary activity (ACA) by titration with guinea pig complement, sterility by microbial cultures, abnormal toxicity by intraperitoneal injection into mice and guinea pigs, pyrogenicity by IV administration into rabbits, and heat stability by heating at 57 \u221e C for 4 hours.

            "text": "In response to viral infections, the human body usually generates virus-specific antibodies immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) after 2 weeks. The levels of IgM gradually diminish, whereas those of IgG sustain for a longer period. In this study, examination of the convalescent plasma collected 4 weeks after patients recovered from SARS revealed that the SARS virus-specific IgG was detected in all the plasma units, but there was individual variation in the SARS antibody titer (1:2-1:48 by ELISA). The variation in SARS antibody titer was likely a reflection of the immunity of the infected individuals. Individual variation of virus-specific antibody in titer as well as polyvalency may compromise the effectiveness of therapy with convalescent plasma. Preparation of purified and concentrated hyperimmune globulins from pooled convalescent plasma should improve product consistency, at least within the same batch, enhance the polyvalency of neutralizing antibodies, and subsequently improve treatment effectiveness. 8, 9 A combination of cold ethanol precipitation and chromatography was selected in the process development over Cohn fractionation or salting out alone, to ensure a higher purity and monomer plus dimer content in the hyperimmune globulin preparation. Although the product yield and titer recovery of this study are comparable to large-scale production, these are not satisfactory for the process of precious plasma, for example, SARS convalescent plasma. Better yield and titer recovery may be obtained with other approaches, for instance, affinity chromatography or preparative electrophoresis. Further study is needed for the improvement in product yield and titer recovery. The SARS virus is 80 to 140 nm in diameter 15 and lipid-enveloped and, thus, is expected to be removed and/or inactivated by the nanofiltration (50 nm) and the S/D technology, which is validated virus clearance methods for viruses including HBV, HCV, and HIV. Moreover, cold ethanol precipitation, low pH formulation, and perhaps chromatography partitioning can also add to the product safety. In the hyperimmune globulins, no SARS virus-specific genetic material was detectable with a real-time PCR. Additional experiments are necessary to evaluate virus clearance capacity of the process.",
