In a meta-analysis, Qiu et al. [7], found that 39.2% of Chinese medical workers suffered from sleep disturbances, which indicated the prevalence was much higher than general population. The outbreak of COVID-19 in China remains to be a serious challenge for FMW. They are not only under high risk of being infected with the disease but also high mental stress, which may lead to acute sleep disturbances [8]. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression of FMW in Hubei Province, and made a comparison with non-FMW. We hypothesized that FMW would report greater sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression levels than non-FMW.",

PSQI is a self-reported questionnaire which assesses subjective sleep quality within one month. A subject with a total score > 6 points is defined as poor sleep quality. The higher the PSQI, the worse the sleep quality [9]. The AIS is a brief instrument to assess the severity of insomnia. It contains eight items with each item rated from 0 to 3 points [10]. A subject with a total score > 6 points screens positive for insomnia. The higher the AIS, the more severe the insomnia [11]. In this study, we used the VAS was used to measure anxiety and depression. Furthermore, the VAS was presented as a horizontal graphic slider, which was divided into 10 segments from 1 (weakest) to (strongest). Higher scores indicate stronger feeling of each mental status.",

By comparison, the present study demonstrated that medical workers under COVID-19 outbreak suffered from elevated sleep disturbances, especially for FMW. Our study showed that 78.4% of FMW had poor sleep quality and 51.7% of them had insomnia. The high prevalence of sleep disturbances for FMW should be put much emphasize, since sleep disturbances influence not only medical workers\u2019 health but also their professional performance [12]. The study also demonstrated FMW had significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances than non-FMW. Change of work environment may underpin the more severe sleep disturbances of FMW. With the direct contact with COVID-19 patients, FMW are inclined to emerge anxiety and worries of being infected. The rapid spread of COVID-19 boomed the medical demands, aggravated the shortage of medical resources, and increased work stress for FMW, especially for those with continuous work and frequent day-night shifts. By comparison, non-FMW work in a relatively mild environment and have less possibility of being infected, thus having fewer sleep disturbances. Our study also found female FMW had worse sleep quality than male FMW. Zhang et al. [13], calculated a hazard ratio of 1.41 for female versus male toward insomnia. In general, females have inferior symptom bearing and more bodily vigilance [14], which potentially exaggerates the severity and prevalence of sleep disturbances.",
