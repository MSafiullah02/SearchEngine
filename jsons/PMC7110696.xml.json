This event gathers from two to three million participants from more than 180 countries [1].

            "text": "The microbial contamination of surfaces in both health care and community settings is not uncommon, and pathogens are capable of surviving for prolonged periods on such surfaces and can be transmitted to humans via direct contact with contaminated surfaces [18,19]. Most gram-positive bacteria survive for months on dry surfaces. Many gram-negative species can also survive for months. A few others, such as Bordetella pertussis, or Haemophilus influenzae, however, persist only for days [20]. However, the human rhinovirus, human coronavirus and influenza virus have all been found to survive in the external environment, for only a matter of hours and occasionally for a day or two [21]. Few studies on the presence of environmental pathogens that may be responsible for human respiratory infections have been conducted in the context of Hajj. Angelakis et al. conducted a study investigating viable bacterial populations in air samples collected around slaughterhouses during the 2012 Hajj season by culture methods. Bacillus and Staphylococcus spp. were commonly isolated [22]. To our knowledge, only one study aiming at detecting the presence of respiratory pathogens by PCR, was conducted in the context of the Hajj and was based on air and surface samples obtained in Jeddah airport in 2013 [23]. In this survey, pathogens detected on surfaces were adenovirus (n = 3/40, 7.5%), HCoV (n = 3/40, 7.5%), H. influenzae (n = 1/40, 2.5%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 1/40, 2.5%). No sample was positive for HRV and S. pneumoniae. S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were not tested [23]. Our study showed that respiratory bacteria, notably K. pneumoniae and S. pneumoniae and HRV were frequently recovered from environmental surface samples in areas frequented by pilgrims. Particularly high levels of contaminated surface were observed in Mina's camp, particularly from the surfaces of the collective kitchen, including tables, drinking sources and the ice supply. Hotel bathroom and ablution area equipments in Mecca were also highly contaminated. Among the French pilgrims surveyed in 2016 [15] and 2018 (unpublished data) who have stayed in the places investigated in the present survey, 16.3% acquired coronaviruses, 16.4% S. aureus, 17.3% K. pneumoniae, 25.5% S. pneumoniae, 26.7% HRV and 30.3% acquired H. influenzae during their stay in Saudi Arabia (Fig. 2\n). High rates of contamination of surface samples by K. pneumoniae and HRV suggest a possible source of contamination for pilgrims (Fig. 2). The acquisition of influenza A and influenza B virus was low among pilgrims (2.2% and 0.4% respectively) and no surface sample was positive for these viruses. It is likely that the living conditions in Mina encampment in relative promiscuity and sharing of cooking, food, hygiene and sanitary facilities are responsible for the high rate of environmental contamination by respiratory pathogens from ill pilgrims with possible subsequent transmission to pilgrims through contact with fomites. Although most pilgrims have onset of respiratory symptoms shortly after their arrival in Saudi Arabia (likely resulting from inter-human transmission of respiratory pathogens in various crowed infrastructures in the city), we observed a bimodal pattern of clinical respiratory symptoms with a lower secondary peak occurring in Mina [24]. Our results suggest that the source of contamination for respiratory pathogens might differ in Mecca and Mina, with a possible additional role for contaminated fomites in Mina, besides air-transmission.",

Wet surfaces of bathrooms, wash basin taps and wash basins were those most frequently found positive, followed by doors and handles, suggesting that environmental surfaces are potential reservoirs for pathogens such as K. pneumoniae. [25]. Humans are the main host for S. pneumoniae, but direct person-to-person contact is not required for bacteria transmission, thus indicating that environmental reservoir could be involved [26].

Additionally, because the detection was based on molecular techniques only, we cannot prove that the detected pathogens were alive and potentially infective. Finally, our sample size is relatively small. Despite these limitations, we demonstrated that DNA and RNA of respiratory pathogens are present at high rates on surfaces in the environment of pilgrims during the Hajj, notably in Mina. Memish et al. hypothesized that, in the absence of good hand hygiene, there is a possibility that pilgrims could pick up environmental pathogens on their hands from contaminated surfaces and self-inoculate or further transmit these pathogens [23]. Respiratory tract infections during Hajj continue to exert a heavy burden on pilgrims [4]. Besides early identification of pathogenic bacterial or viral clusters for faster mitigation of outbreaks and better understanding of disease etiology, we believe that further larger-scale studies are needed to better evaluate the possible role of environmental respiratory pathogens in causing respiratory infections among Hajj pilgrims. In the interim, reinforced hand hygiene and improved cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces at various locations during the pilgrimage should be recommended with a priority for wet surfaces, kitchen tables and door handles.",
