PTX3 treatment attenuated virulence in vitro and in vivo, and showed potential therapeutic effects by reducing the virus load and enhancing the survival of infected animals.21 Smits et al.,22 found that PTX3, among other genes, such as VCAM1, F3 and IL-8, was significantly increased after SARS-CoV infection in aged macaques.",

This will be clinically relevant because the susceptibility of patients to SARS-CoV also varies. Different strains of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV have been developed by Subbarao's6 and Barnard's groups,7 respectively.
