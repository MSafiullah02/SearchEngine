Second, the system switched from paper-based reporting to the submission of electronic files in 1985, and since 2003 has used web-based reporting (figure 1\n).

Infection spread within Guangdong and to Hong Kong, then from Hong Kong to other parts of the world. Simultaneously, SARS spread to other provinces in China, including Beijing (in March, 2003), resulting in the world's largest local SARS epidemic.17 Overall, China reported 5327 of 8071 (66%) cases and 349 of 776 (45%) deaths from the 2003 worldwide SARS epidemic.18 After some delay in response, the government mobilised the entire country to control the spread of the epidemic. After successful containment in June, 2003, three other laboratory-related outbreaks occurred in Beijing, Singapore, and Taiwan.19 The origin of the virus was never identified, but studies suggest that bats might serve as the animal reservoir20, 21, 22, 23 and that civet cats might have been the immediate source of the virus that infected people.24\n",

International collaborative projects provided additional support to the national tuberculosis control programme. The ministry of health provided widespread technical assistance and training, and monitored the implementation of quality-control programmes. With the new internet-based disease reporting system, specific efforts were taken to ensure that all suspected and confirmed cases of tuberculosis seen in China's vast hospital system would be immediately reported to the local Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In turn, CDC staff actively follow-up these reported cases. This approach, which linked the hospital and the public-health services, played an important part in increasing the detection of tuberculosis cases.45 By the end of 2005, the detection of infectious cases had increased to 80% and treatment was successful for 92% of these cases, surpassing the 2005 worldwide tuberculosis control targets set by the WHO. China was one of only four countries with a high tuberculosis burden to achieve this target.45\n",

The ministry of health took note of the successful use of modern information technology during the epidemic and built the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system, called the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP). The CISDCP had two important improvements compared with the previous reporting system. The first is that diseases were reported in real time. In the past, hospitals and clinics would submit case-report forms to their county or district CDC; local CDCs would submit report summaries once a month up the chain to the national CDC. With the CISDCP, hospitals and clinics immediately and directly reported through the internet. This innovation allows public-health officials to have real-time information on diseases so they can immediately identify disease outbreaks and implement any needed containment strategies.",

To address this difficulty, the Ministry of Health developed a surveillance and response system for pneumonia of unknown cause, in which reporting through the CISDCP is required. Pneumonia was selected because airborne pathogens, such as the SARS coronavirus, highly pathogenic avian influenza, or human influenza are most likely to cause a major rapid disease epidemic. Once a patient's profile meets the clinical, radiological, and laboratory criteria of pneumonia of unknown cause, hospitals are required to report the case within 24 h and, if necessary, take immediate action to contain the spread of the disease. Once the national CDC identifies a case of pneumonia of unknown cause through the CISDCP, active contact with the provincial and lower-level CDCs and hospitals ensures that the case is properly diagnosed and managed, and that appropriate measures are undertaken to contain the disease.",

Most of these cases were not linked to known avian influenza outbreaks in poultry or birds, so the surveillance system played a key part in their identification. For the 21 cases, the average time from symptom onset to report in the CISDCP system was 9\u00b75 days and a further 10 days to confirm the presence of human avian influenza infection. Confirmation of a disease would lead to a reporting delay of at least 10 days, which could have led to further disease transmission. Although much more work is needed to further improve this surveillance system, initial results are encouraging. If an influenza pandemic were to begin in China, this surveillance system could identify clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin in real time, thereby providing Chinese health authorities and the rest of the world with early warning of the start of the pandemic.",
