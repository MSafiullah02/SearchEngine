I use twenty different individual characterizations of unhappiness including many not good mental health days; anxiety; worry; loneliness; sadness; stress; pain; strain, depression and bad nerves; phobias and panic; being downhearted; having restless sleep; losing confidence in oneself; not being able to overcome difficulties; being under strain; being unhappy; feeling a failure; feeling left out; feeling tense; and thinking of yourself as a worthless person. I also analyze responses to a further general attitudinal measure regarding whether the situation in the respondent's country is getting worse. Responses to all these unhappiness questions show a, ceteris paribus, hill shape in age, with controls and many also do so with limited controls for time and country. Unhappiness is hill-shaped in age and the average age where the maximum occurs is 49 with or without controls. There is an unhappiness curve.",

Most exhibit these profiles without the inclusion of controls other than for time and country or region, and all do so with controls for gender, education, marital and labor force status. I find that this hill shape in age in unhappiness, reveals itself in twenty-one different characterizations of unhappiness taken from over fourteen million respondents in eight surveys conducted in forty European countries 1 and the United States and a sample of 168 countries from around the world using the Gallup World Poll. Some of these outcomes are found in more than one dataset e.g. depression, sadness, poor or restless sleep and loneliness.",

            "text": "The first eleven variables on the list, relate directly to poor mental health that often requires medical treatment including anti-depressants and even hospitalization. Examples are being treated for depression, bad nerves, feeling stressed and tense along with anxiety and worry. Phobias and panics relate to more serious, and rare, forms of mental illness such as schizophrenia. The next seven variables relate to failures in social interactions and feelings with various examples of how people feel left out of society and have difficulty fitting in, or feeling good about themselves, being lonely; having low confidence, not feeling a success; feeling worthless and being unable to overcome difficulties. The third grouping is about physical well-beinghaving pain and being unable to sleep. Other groupings of course are feasible. The final grouping relates to a broader view of national well-being where individuals report on whether they think the country are going badly. This paper is complementary to Blanchflower (2020a) that looked at happiness rather than unhappiness data and showed a U-shaped relationship in age, separately in 132 countries, controlling for age, education, marital and labor force status and in many instances without controls other than time dummies. 2 The paper found a U-shape in one hundred and nine developing countries and thirty-six advanced countries. It applied to every EU28 country, every OECD country, to rich and poor countries and to all five continents. The happiness curve was mostly found using happiness and life satisfaction variables, but it was also found using a group of other measures including views on politics and the economy as well as satisfaction with an individual's financial situation, their living standards, the local area where they live and so on. All showed a midlife dip with a minimum around age 50. In this paper I show the mirror image of the U-shape happiness curve (Rauch, 2018) . There is a hump or hill shaped unhappiness curve in age. Well-being reaches a zenith in mid-life.",

For example, in their data lack of paid employment was more strongly associated with a reduction in positive feelings than with an increase in psychological symptoms like depression and anxiety. Huppert (2009) asked the question whether drivers of well-being are the same as drivers of illbeing? Huppert concluded that \"some are, and some are not\". Thus, neuroticism, for example, she argues, appears to drive negative mood and common mental disorders, whereas extraversion drives positive emotional characteristics. Serotonin levels have been shown to be related to positive mood but not to negative mood. Huppert concluded that mental well-being and ill-being \"have different biological as well as behavioral effects\" (2009, p.142) .",

Blanchflower and Oswald (2008) examined Ushapes using happiness measures but the paper also explored unhappiness and reported a midlife nadir in well-being using data on depression for the UK from the Labour Force Surveys of 2004Q2-2007Q2 and on mental distress across thirteen EU countries from Eurobarometer #56.1. This data file contained information both on life satisfaction and six elements of the well-known General Health Questionnaire (GHQ6) mental distress score.

For example, Blanchflower and Oswald (2016) analyzed the use of anti-depressants in randomized samples from 27 European countries in 2010 Eurobarometer data and show that the probability of taking antidepressants also follows hill shaped path that peaked in people's late 40s. Graham and Pozuelo (2017) analyzed stress using data from the Gallup World Poll from 2005-2014 and found hump shapes in age, including controls for gender, education, marital and employment status and household income in 34 countries. 5 Fortin et al (2015) using the same Gallup World Poll data also find evidence of a hump-shape in age for stress and also find the same for worry and anger even in the raw data without controls, for men and women separately. Krueger (2017) found evidence from the American Time Use Survey for 2010, 2012, and 2013 that prime-age men and women age 25-54 were significantly more tired, sad or stressed than was the case for younger or older groups. The differences were especially marked for those not in the labor force. Krueger argued that one factor that likely contributes to the low level of emotional wellbeing of prime age, NLF men is the relatively high amount of time they spend alone. Prime age, NLF men, he found, spent nearly 30 percent of their time alone, compared with 18 percent for prime age, employed men and 17 percent for prime age, employed women. This paper adds to the growing list of unhappiness variables that contain hill shapes in age. I examine the relationship between unhappiness and age using eight well-being data series with over fourteen million observations. The data sets are 1) the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 4 As an illustration in the 10-step anxiety equation using the 2016-2018 Annual Population Survey data for the UK used in Table 11 the coefficient on the male variable with limited controls is -.385 (t=35) and with controls it is -.303 (t=24). The file also includes a 10-step life satisfaction variable and when it is used as the dependent variable with the same limited controls the male coefficient is -.024 (t=3.5) and with controls for education, marital and labor force status added it is -.096 (t=13.1). The same sign for the male coefficient in both a happiness and an unhappiness equation 2005 . For simplicity I examine these files in aggregate and do not do any analysis at the level of the individual country but as appropriate include country dummies. For the US analysis I always include state dummies and for the UK, region dummies.",

Non-Hispanic whites with the least education have done particularly poorly.

Among women, particularly, life expectancy declined in the more deprived areas of the country. Some areas, especially in the North, have been ignored left behind, as health has improved elsewhere.\" Mortality rates for those aged 45-49 they found were especially high.",

There are ten countries with higher deaths of despair rates than is found in the United States, in order, Slovenia; Lithuania; Latvia; Korea; Denmark; Belgium; Hungary; Austria; Finland and Poland. Drug overdose rates in 2016 the OECD reported (their Figure 5 .5) were higher in Germany (1/100,000) and Austria (1.1/100,000) than they were in the USA (0.9/100000). Deaths from acute alcohol abuse were higher in Denmark (10.5), Poland (6.2); Germany (5.3), Austria (4.8) and France (3.5) versus 2.8 in the USA (rates /100,000 population). Deaths of despair do not seem to be a uniquely American problem. c) Pain Case and Deaton (2015) examined data from the U.S. National Health Interview Survey and found that one in three white non-Hispanics aged 45-54 reported chronic joint pain in the 2011-13 period. They found that the prevalence of pain was highest for those ages 35-54 with less than a high school education. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) reported (2011) a marked rise in pain between 2000 and 2009, especially for those ages 45-64 and for white non-Hispanics. Case and Deaton (2020b) argue that \"social and community distress, the labor market, politics and corporate interests all collide around pain.\" Case and Deaton (2020a, p83) argue that \"pain has a special place in our narrative. Social and community distress, the labor market, politics and corporate interests all collide around pain, and pain is one of the channels through which each of them affects deaths of despair.\" Blanchflower and Oswald (2019a) found that Americans were disproportionately likely to report being in pain. Krueger (2017) found that nearly half of prime age men in the United States who are not in the labor force take pain medication on any given day; and in nearly two-thirds of these cases, they take prescription pain medication. According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (2017), more than 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, which is pain that lasts three months. Carpenter, McClellan, and Rees (2017) have found robust evidence that economic downturns lead to increases in the intensity of prescription pain reliever use as well as increases in clinically relevant substance-use disorders involving opioids. These effects are concentrated among working-age white men with low educational attainment.",

The weighted probability of reporting pain over the decade rose from 15% for those under twenty; 24% for those 40-49, rising to 30% in the age group 50-69 before declining thereafter. Using the same US Gallup data Case and Deaton (2020b, p.86) show that across counties, the fraction of people reporting pain yesterday \"is strongly associated with suicides and with deaths of despair more generally\" d) Suicide Burns (2016) reported that in Australia from 2004-2013 for both males and females there were mid-life humps in suicide rates for men and women that maximized at age 40-44 and for women declined thereafter. For women averaged over the period the rate was 7.42 per 100,000 at ages 40-44 and 4.69 at age 85+. For men the 40-44 rate was 25.72 at age 40-44 falling to 15.96 at 65-69 and then rising steadily to 33.44 at age 85+. Case and Deaton (2017) looked at suicide in the U.S. across three broad age bands 25-34; 35-54 and 55+ and found \"the well-known U-shaped pattern of life evaluation for both men and women; for both sexes, life evaluation is at its lowest in middle age. If suicide rates are to match this, they should peak in middle age. This is true for women, but not for men. The suicide rate for men in 2013 rises with age with no sign of a peak in middle age, at least across these coarse age categories. By contrast, women were more likely to commit suicide in middle age than in youth or in old age, matching the age-pattern in life evaluation\" (p. 311). Oswald and Tohamy (2017) found a hill-shape in age in female suicides in the United States. The authors found it separately for black and white females in the US in 1980, plus in 2013 as well as in individual country data in the UK, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden in 2013.",

Rates then drop through the late sixties but then pick up again through later life. The picture is rather different in some other countries as Table 2b which uses the same OECD data source makes clear for the six main Englishspeaking countries of Australia; Canada; Ireland; New Zealand; the UK and the USA. All six show rates in middle age which are higher than the rates in old age. These English-speaking countries have a peak suicide rate between ages 45 and 54. There is indeed a peak in suicide rates in mid-life. The rate of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (drugs such as fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and tramadol) increased by 10%, from 9.0 in 2017 to 9.9 in 2018. Lippold et al (2019) reported that from 2015 to 2017, nearly all racial/ethnic groups and age groups experienced significant increases in opioid-involved and synthetic opioid-involved overdose death rates, particularly blacks aged 45-54 years (from 19.3 to 41.9 per 100,000) and 55-64 years (from 21.8 to 42.7) in large central metro areas.

The analytical approach would divide the possible rise in happiness into two componentsthat coming from income per se and any residual effect from ageing per se. Adding controls is not simply equivalent to finding that those in their 70s would be happier if they were healthier and their friends were alive. The findings with controls show that the old are happier despite the other things that may have happened as they age, such as losing friends or declining health. Blanchflower and Oswald (2009) in a response to Glenn showed that in many countries, the Ushape can be found without any control variables. That is what we find here, that the hump or hill shape in unhappiness, or what psychologists call negative affect, is clearly seen both with a full set of socio-economic controls and with limited controls for year and country or region. This is less clear in raw data on happiness in the United States, where there is an early rise in happiness to around age thirty which disappears when controls are included, using life satisfaction in the 2010 BRFSS (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2019b, Figure 2 ); happiness in the General Social Survey, 1972-2014 (see Blanchflower and Oswald, 2019b, Figure 6 ) and Cantril's life satisfaction ladder from the US Gallup Daily Tracker Poll, 2008-2017 (Blanchflower, 2020a) . It seems that the hill shape with limited controls is easier to find than the U-shape is in happiness data with limited controls.",

It splits the data into the pre-recession period of 1993-2007 and then the post-recession data from 2008 through 2019. The two hill shapes are similar to the limited control one in Chart 1, but it is clear that the levels are higher with the hill-shape peaking at around 8% in the early period and 12% in the latter. Chart 3 does the same, with limited controls for high school dropouts and there are hump shapes for both but the rise over time is notably marked with the peak going from around 20% to 26%. 13 Table 3 reports the results of estimating an OLS equation with at least twenty out of thirty not good mental health days as the dependent variable and six age variables that rise steadily through the 50-59 band and then fall back in the first column with limited controls. In the second column when controls for race, education, marital status and employment are added (with controls), the high point is in the forties. In the third column that adds 9 decade of birth cohort dummies the peak is in the age band 40-49. The final two columns of Table 3 for white high school dropouts, split the sample into two periods 1993-2007 in column 4 and 2008-2019. In both cases a peak is reached in the age band 40-49, but with a larger coefficient in the second period (.075) than in the first (.054). Of note over this time period is that the incidence of sadness (17.7% and 17.5%) and worry (31.5% and 32.0%) remained broadly unchanged between the two end points. 14 In contrast reported pain yesterday increased from 23.2% in 2008 to 27.1% in 2018 while the incidence of depression yesterday rose from 17.1% to 18.5% over these ten years. Table 4 reports on the weighted distribution by age for each of these four variables overall and for those with less than a high school education. In all cases the highest incidence is in mid-life. It is notable that the incidence is highest among the least educated and especially so with pain. For high school dropouts (HSD) in the age group 50-59 nearly a half, reported pain yesterday. Table 5 reports eight OLS regressions for these four variables, with limited controls and with controls. There is a hill-shape in every case with and with limited controls. Charts 4-7 plots single year of age coefficients, added to the constant, with controls and with limited controls for these four variables. They all show well-defined hump shapes with limited or a full set of socioeconomic controls. The least well defined hill shape is for pain with limited controls as suggested in Table 5 .",

GHQ6 is a measure of psychological distress that comes from amalgamating answers to the following six questions, with sample sizes in parentheses. The integers 0, 1, 2, 3 were assigned to each variable depending whether each was answered not at all (=0), no more than usual (=1), rather more than usual (=2), much more than usual (=3). The numerical answers were then summed. Overall, a GHQ6 mental distress score which must by definition lie between 0 and 18, was examined, such that, the higher the score the more distress. Blanchflower and Oswald (2008) found that there was a hump U-shape in age across countries with this GHQ6 variable, with a limited or full set of personal controls. But we did not investigate the individual components of the score. That is what I do in Table 8 , with and without controls. In all six examples, with the dependent variable scored from zero to three, there is a hump or hill shape with and without controls. The calculated maxima based on the age quadratics for all six variables, whether there are controls or not, are in the forties and fifties.",

There is thus an obvious hill shape again in these raw data. It turns out there is also in the regressions with and without controls as shown in Table  12 . 24 Chart 14 plots the single year of age coefficients that are added to the constant when the two equations in Table 12 are re-estimated, with limited and a full set of controls. In both cases there are hump shapes, maximizing in the late thirties.",

That matches the evidence for a nadir in happiness that reaches a low in the late forties also (Blanchflower, 2020a) . In that paper it was found that, averaging across 257 individual country estimates from developing countries gave an age minimum of 48.2 for well-being and doing the same across the 187 country estimates for advanced countries gives a similar minimum of 47.2. Table 14 summarizes the results obtained by solving out the age at which the quadratic fitted to the data reaches a maximum. There are sixteen without controls that average at 47.4 and twentyeight with controls with the maxima averaging out to 49.1, and 48.6 years overall for the fortyfour estimates. This is very close to the finding in Blanchflower (2020a) that the U-shape in happiness data averaged 47.2 in developed countries and 48.2 in developing. The conclusion is therefore that data on unhappiness and happiness are highly consistent at the age when the low point or zenith in well-being occurs.",

No matter the exact shape of the plots in the various charts, it is clear that there is a peak somewhere in mid-life. I don't claim the patterns are all identical, but their broad similarity is striking, with a peak in prime age. There is a clear consistent pattern in the unhappiness and age data. Blanchflower and Graham (2020) showed that the drop in measured happiness from youth to the mid-point low of the U-shape is quantitatively large and was not \"trivial\" as some psychologists have claimed. Indeed, they show the decline in well-being was about the equivalent of that observed from losing a spouse or a job. The results on unhappiness are similar. For example, in the Gallup USDTP averaged across the years 2008-2017 the probability of depression in the raw data rose from 12% at age 18 to 21% at age 58. The proportion of the employed who were depressed was 12% versus 24% for the unemployed. In addition, 12% of the married were depressed yesterday versus 19% of the widowed. In the raw data from the BRFSS the proportion who said they had 20 or more bad days in a month was 6.6% at age 18 and 8.4 at age 47, the peak. Among the married the rate was 5.5% versus 8% for the widowed. The rise in unhappiness to the mid-life peak, is thus large and comparable in magnitude to major life events.",

First, that individuals learn to adapt to their strengths and weaknesses, and in midlife quell their infeasible aspirations. Second, it could be that cheerful people live systematically longer than the miserable, and that the nadir in happiness in mid-life thus traces out in part a selection effect. A third is that a kind of comparison process is at work: I have seen schoolfriends die and come eventually to value my blessings during my remaining years. Steptoe et al (2010) suggest that \"it is plausible that wellbeing improves when children leave home, given reduced levels of family conflict and financial burden\" (p.9986, 2010).",

Some especially defenseless individuals might face downward spirals as age and life circumstances interact. Many will not be getting the social/emotional support they need as they are isolated and lonely, in addition to the first-order effects of whatever they are coping with in normal times. Lack of health care coverage in the US may well be a compounding factor where there is also an obesity epidemic. A midlife low is tough and made much harder when combined with a deep downturn and a slow and weak recovery. Peak unhappiness occurs in mid-life. There is an unhappiness curve.
