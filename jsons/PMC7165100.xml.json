The 7th edition of the guidelines revised and further emphasized the importance of CT examination in discharge criteria [5]. The acute bilateral pulmonary exudative lesions significantly diminishing was included in the new revision. We considered that this more strict criterium might compensate for the false negative rate of the nucleic acid test to some extent. Furthermore, the serial CT features may help evaluate the changes in lesions and offer more valuable clinical information. The density, however, was more likely to show changes in lesions rather than the number or area. By observing serial CT images, patients without significant decreases in lesions need additional time before repeated nucleic acid tests to diminish the false negative rate.",
