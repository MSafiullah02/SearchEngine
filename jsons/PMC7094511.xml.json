For a country to be considered free from the FMD virus (FMDV), different diagnostic approaches are required according to whether vaccine has been used and if so whether it was used in response to an outbreak of disease or as part of routine prophylaxis. The ability to differentiate between these different immune states has been an area of much research. The current preferred test to differentiate infected from vaccinated (DIVA) animals is a competition ELISA (C-ELISA) designed to detect antibodies to the non-structural protein 3ABC as an indicator of infection (Sorensen et al., 2005, Clavijo et al., 2004, Foord et al., 2007).",

Although non-structural proteins can in theory contaminate the vaccine preparation, it is expected that FMDV vaccines produced by most current commercial manufacturers will not induce significant antibody responses to non-structural proteins. Provided these DIVA tests are used under controlled circumstances and knowledge of vaccine quality understood, they can be of tremendous benefit for FMDV diagnosis and surveillance.",

Antigen association and dissociation phases were each monitored for 180 s and 300 s, respectively. At least one buffer blank injection was included for the purpose of double-referencing (Myszka, 1999). The FM26 and FM27 scFv protein surfaces were regenerated with a 15 s injection of 90 mM phosphoric acid at 30 \u00b5l/min. Scrubber software (version 2.0c; BioLogic Software, Campbell, Australia) was utilized to process all Biacore T100 generated sensorgrams and to determine association rate (k\na) and dissociation rate (k\nd) constants by globally fitting to the processed data sets to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD) was calculated from the quotient of k\nd/k\na.",

Because the AP gene is derived from E. coli, FM27-YYEP was included as a control alongside the FM27-AP and FM27-AP/S constructs for all studies. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of the CRAb\u2013AP fusion protein with the predicted molecular mass of approximately 72 kDa (Fig. 4A). The functionality of the fusion protein was demonstrated by directly measuring AP activity in the crude supernatant as shown in Fig. 4B. Background AP activity was negligible as indicated by the control FM27-YYEP. As expected, the FM27-AP/S clone exhibited higher enzyme activity than the FM27-AP clone.

For the sheep sera tested, the six na\u00efve and six FMDV-vaccinated sera showed an inhibition of less than 20% and 31% respectively and the sera from FMDV-infected sheep showed inhibition of 76, 81 and 84%.",

Chicken recombinant antibodies are not only simple to produce but they are also less cross-reactive when used in combination with mammalian antibodies in immunoassays. Our previous FMDV DIVA C-ELISA (Foord et al., 2007) utilized a commercial E-tag which can only be detected using the commercial anti-E-tag antibodies (the E-tag mAb is no longer commercially available). In this current study, we determined the epitope sequences recognised by the two closely related CRAbs and the binding affinities by biosensor. To further improve their application, the CRAbs were modified to include non-commercial tags and an antibody\u2013enzyme fusion protein.",

It was interesting to note that both CRAbs have two binding sites within the 3B region, designated 3B-1 and 3B-2 in this study. Although both CRAbs bound the same site, the data obtained from the phage library suggests a subtle difference in the key residual contacts between the two antibodies. In the \u03a6-DPLE(D) motif, CRAb-FM26 has a more stringent requirement for the Y residue at the \u03a6 position and the presence of the P residue than that of CRAb-FM27. This difference in binding between FM26 and FM27 was further demonstrated by absolute affinity measurements using a biosensor. This was most notable with the association rate constant (k\na), which showed an approximate 3-fold difference between the antibodies, with FM27 having a faster on-rate. Since the variable heavy (VH) chain complementary determining regions of the two antibody molecules is identical (Foord et al., 2007), one could conclude that the observed difference in binding affinity and mimotope specificity is entirely dependent on the variable light (VL) chain. These data would suggest that further VL-randomization may be used as a strategy to improve the assay sensitivity in the future.",

For this application we chose two epitope tags derived from the SARS coronavirus spike protein and the classical swine fever virus E2 protein, which have been developed in our group (M. Yu, unpublished results). Although both tags maintained the functionality of the CRAbs, the YYEP tag was more effective in the C-ELISA than the SARS-tag. For this reason, the in-house produced YYEP tag will be used in all future studies. A potential future improvement will be a direct conjugation of HRP with the 4\u20139D4 antibody for detection of the YYEP epitope tag.",

We moved to a direct antibody\u2013enzyme fusion system to simplify the assay to a single antibody in a one-step assay format. To do this, we employed the AP-fusion vectors developed by Kershbaumer's group (Kerschbaumer et al., 1996, Kerschbaumer et al., 1997), that contained both the wild type and a mutant AP gene. The mutant gene denoted AP/S contained a serine residue (S) at position 101 instead of the wildtype aspartate residue (D), which has the potential to increase the specific AP activity by 35 fold (Kerschbaumer et al., 1997). The CRAb\u2013AP fusion proteins generated in this study maintained both the AP activity and the antibody specificity of the two fusion partner proteins. However, the FM27-AP/S was only 3 fold more reactive than the FM27-AP. Nevertheless, the FM27-AP/S represents a very promising reagent for wider application of the one-step FMDV DIVA test.",
