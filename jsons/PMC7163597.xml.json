            "text": "Great strides have been made toward acknowledging the important role that disturbances of varying magnitudes and frequencies play in retaining biodiversity and ecosystem resilience (Sousa 1984, Paine et al. 1998). In particular, increasing recognition by resource managers of the need to use disturbance as a tool for managing landscape complexity (e.g., heterogeneous mosaics of successional stages; Fuhlendorf et al. 2009, Swanson et al. 2010) has led to application of lower intensity disturbances (e.g., use of prescribed fire) and increased comfort with infrequent, high\u2010intensity disturbances (e.g., \u201clet burn\u201d policies for wildland fire, large dam releases to mimic flood events). This shift has been especially important in seasonally dry, fire\u2010prone forests where fire exclusion was the dominant management approach through much of the 20th century (Carle 2002). A first step toward managing for complexity is determining the set of \u201cdesirable\u201d conditions for a particular landscape (e.g., maintenance of a regional species pool on publicly owned lands) and which species will be present (or absent) under those conditions (Youngblood et al. 2007). In concert with increased incorporation of disturbance into land management, practitioners often require knowledge of the potential for surrogate treatments such as forest thinning to emulate disturbances in situations where human safety and property might be compromised. The degree to which these surrogates mimic natural disturbances has not been rigorously evaluated, particularly in their ability to provide comparable wildlife habitat (but see Arkle and Pilliod 2010).",

            "text": "Vegetation response to fire has been a central topic of fire ecology, vegetation science, and forest management for many decades and much is known across many ecosystems (Bond and van Wilgen 1996, Pyne et al. 1996). However, despite high management and policy interest in wildlife, faunal response to fire has received substantially less attention. Much of this is due to the difficulty of studying fire\u2013wildlife interactions; consequently, a great deal of the literature is based upon convenience sampling of wildfires that burned preexisting sample points (e.g., Smucker et al. 2005, Hossack and Corn 2007, Kotliar et al. 2007). Reviewing global fire literature on the birds, the best\u2010studied vertebrate taxon, Leidolf and Bissonette (2009) found just over 500 documents, of which <50% were journal articles containing original research and of which >50% had been published since 1990. Of the avian\u2013fire literature, North America accounted for nearly 60% of publications (Leidolf and Bissonette 2009). Literature examining the effects of fire on other North American vertebrate taxa (small mammals, herpetofauna, and so forth) is far more sparse (Kennedy and Fontaine 2009). Thus, although we are in a period of rapidly increasing knowledge, few generalities exist with regard to faunal responses to fire. Even within the increasingly prolific avian\u2013fire literature, knowledge attenuates rapidly after examination of a few well\u2010studied examples (e.g., short\u2010term, positive responses of some woodpecker species to high\u2010severity fire; Saab et al. 2007).",

To date, most reviews have relied on qualitative comparisons, employing a vote\u2010counting approach (Rosenberg et al. 2000) to the literature and making little formal assessment of the effect size of fire severities, fire surrogates, and time since fire on fauna. Previous reviews of the avian\u2013fire literature have repeatedly called for more quantitative reviews that examine, in detail, the effects of fire severity and time since fire (Kotliar et al. 2002, Saab and Powell 2005). Moreover, synthesis of recent research from the Fire and Fire Surrogate (FFS) study (McIver et al. 2008) for fauna is lacking. Quantification of these effect sizes is highly desired by public land managers responsible for maintaining biodiversity as well as implementing management actions (e.g., thinning, fire) on the ground and frequently subject to extensive public scrutiny (Youngblood et al. 2007).",

We used this analysis to evaluate the following questions. (1) Do vertebrates respond to fire surrogate treatments in a manner similar to low/moderate\u2010severity prescribed fire? (2) Do vertebrates respond to low/moderate\u2010severity prescribed fire in a manner similar to high\u2010severity wildland fire?

We defined U.S. fire\u2010prone forests as those forests that historically experienced frequent fire (Fig. 1) varying from surface (combustion of litter, aboveground mortality of understory) to mixed severity (spatially complex mosaic of vegetation damage with portions of stand replacement, individual overstory tree mortality, or just understory mortality; Agee 1993). These forests are characterized by fire regimes ranging from extremely regular, short\u2010interval, surface fires (e.g., southeastern pine forests, mean fire intervals 1\u20135 years; Jose et al. 2006) to those characterized by a mix of surface fires and mixed\u2010severity fires at less regular intervals in western North America. The relative contributions of low\u2010 and mixed\u2010severity fire vary with precipitation, with drier forests more dominated by surface fire (e.g., low\u2010elevation southwestern ponderosa pine forests with a fire interval of 2\u201310 years; McIver et al. 2008) and higher elevation/higher latitude forests experiencing a relatively greater proportion of stand\u2010replacement fire (e.g., mixed\u2010evergreen forests of the Klamath\u2010Siskiyou region (see Plate 1) with mean fire intervals of 10\u2013100 years; Agee 1993). Forests exhibiting stand\u2010replacement fires on long time scales (such as jack pine, Pinus banksiana, and lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta\n) were excluded. Implementation of low\u2010severity prescribed fire or comparison of low\u2010 vs. high\u2010severity fire in forest types with stand\u2010replacing fire regimes was not considered relevant, as they generally are not regarded as requiring restoration of fire regimes and are not the focus of fire\u2010based restoration management actions.",

For small mammals, several studies reported genus level (Peromyscus, Tamias) responses, which we also recorded. Vital rate data formed a small portion of the data set and comprised data on avian nest survival and productivity. Each observation was also categorized geographically (state, region, forest type), and by (1) treatment (fire, thinning, thinning plus fire), (2) treatment intensity (fire severity, thinning intensity), (3) time since treatment (years), (4) spatial scale (total area affected; wildland fire size or sum of treated stands), and (5) comparison type (pre\u2013post or after\u2010only). We also recorded whether authors estimated detection or capture probabilities in their study or simply reported unadjusted counts, a potentially large source of confounding bias when comparing across widely varying treatments (for further details, see Kennedy and Fontaine 2009). Ultimately, too few studies adjusted counts or vital rates to account for detection or capture probabilities; thus all studies were treated identically in terms of their potential detection or capture bias, which is commonly done in meta\u2010analyses of vertebrate literature (Parker et al. 2005, Vanderwel et al. 2007, Schlossberg and King 2008).",

Based on the characteristics of the available literature, we created eight categories into which we pooled all observations: low\u2010 and moderate\u2010severity fire (0\u20134 years postfire, 5\u20139 years postfire, >10 years postfire), high\u2010severity fire (0\u20134 years postfire, 5\u20139 years postfire, >10 years postfire), thinning (0\u20134 years posttreatment), and thinning plus fire (0\u20134 years posttreatment). In all cases, a lack of published longer term (>5 years) studies limited us to 0\u20134 years posttreatment. Importantly, we considered only thinning conducted for fuel reduction, which generally is a lower intensity treatment (e.g., median 30% reduction in basal area for the fire and fire surrogate program; Schwilk et al. 2009) than higher\u2010intensity thinning for silvicultural objectives; see Vanderwel et al. (2007) for a detailed meta\u2010analysis of avian response to thinning gradients where most thinning intensities were >30% basal area removal. Data from low\u2010 and moderate\u2010severity fires were pooled because neither of these treatments resulted in major canopy loss (most were <50% canopy mortality, <25% in almost all cases) and there are insufficient studies of mixed\u2010severity fire to warrant separation. High\u2010severity fire was defined as >90% tree mortality (stand\u2010replacing disturbance). In virtually all cases, authors either defined fire severity as stand\u2010replacing or provided percentage canopy mortality as a measure of vegetation damage from fire. Canopy mortality as a measure of fire damage and ecological impact is widely used throughout the fire\u2013vegetation literature (e.g., Donato et al. 2009a\n) as well as in detailed studies of postfire wildlife habitat use (Saab et al. 2007, Kotliar et al. 2008). These categories allow comparison of vertebrate responses to fire surrogates combined with fire, as well as differing levels of fire severity (as measured by overstory mortality).",

In virtually all cases, we took the mean of species abundances across years to avoid pseudoreplication and lack of independence in observations. Where studies had just one replicate measured over time, taking the mean abundance across years also permitted us to estimate variance to properly weight studies and avoid use of proxy weighting schemes (e.g., weighting by plot size; Kalies et al. 2010).

To evaluate response to varying treatments and fire severities, we generated cumulative effect size estimates for each species \u00d7 treatment combination using MetaWin 2.0 (Rosenberg et al. 2000). Each cumulative effect size (the weighted mean of all observations for species \u00d7 treatment combinations, scaled by the pooled standard deviation) possessed three key details: a point estimate, a 95% confidence interval, and number of observations (studies) contributing to that estimate. The point estimate of each effect size reflects the overall response (positive, negative), whereas the confidence interval reflects the precision of the estimate or, in other words, the consistency of the studies contributing to that estimate. Following Burnham and Anderson (2002), we chose to report cumulative effect sizes, their 95% confidence intervals, and sample sizes rather than presenting P values and test statistics; this approach provides clearer, more direct insight into the effects of the treatments that we examined (Johnson 1999).",

[2009] for equations and an excellent explanation of this meta\u2010analytic process). Effect sizes greater than zero reflect positive response to treatment, whereas those less than zero represent negative response (i.e., greater abundance in untreated reference forest). Effect sizes for each observation were then converted to Hedge's d to account for small sample sizes (Rosenberg et al. 2000). We included a random effect of study in the analysis to account for both typical \u201cnoise\u201d as well as true unmeasured differences among studies, a frequent issue in ecological studies (Rosenberg et al. 2000).",

Of the studies that we included and used, only nine were single\u2010species studies that contributed <1% of the observations used to estimate cumulative effect sizes. The vast majority (32 of 41 studies; see Appendix B) were community\u2010 or guild\u2010level and included data for species showing no response.

Therefore the appropriate inference is to the stand scale (\u223c10\u201350 ha); variation due to landscape\u2010scale effects of wildland fire, such as quantity of burned habitat, could not be examined. As such, the cumulative effect size, together with its confidence interval overlap with zero, was used to infer the type of response (positive, negative, neutral; see Discussion for elaboration on neutral responses) being exhibited by a particular species to a treatment at the stand scale across all fire\u2010prone forest types in the United States.

We limited the species pool to those occurring in both treatments for each pairwise comparison of interest (e.g., low/moderate\u2010severity fire vs. thinning). For this species pool, we examined whether the effect size estimate in each treatment was higher, lower, or stayed the same, based upon confidence interval overlap (i.e., a species with a larger response and confidence intervals not overlapping the mean of the comparison would be classified as having increased). To test the effect of varying species composition across the groups, we also subset our data to the 24 species for which we had data for all three fire and fire surrogate treatments and present the same comparisons.

Thinning plus low/moderate\u2010severity fire relative to low\u2010severity fire alone provided a greater level of positive response (52% of 27 species had larger effect sizes, based on 95% confidence interval overlap; Table 3). The golden\u2010mantled ground squirrel (Fig. 3a) typified this pattern of response, with neutral responses to low/moderate\u2010severity fire or thinning alone, but a positive response to the combination of the two treatments. Additionally, across all 27 species, we found little evidence of a negative interaction of thinning and low/moderate\u2010severity fire where responses changed from positive to negative or vice versa; instead, responses appeared to be additive in nature (e.g., Western Bluebird; Fig. 3e) or a neutral to negative/positive change (e.g., golden\u2010mantled ground squirrel, Ovenbird; Fig. 3a, c). However, there were a few exceptions; some species (e.g., pygmy shrew; Table 2) responded positively to the individual treatments but responded negatively to the combined treatment, suggesting a threshold response to the degree of vegetation removal for some taxa. Patterns were nearly identical (within 10%, most <5%) when the species pool was restricted to the 24 species with data in all three treatments (Table 3, values in parentheses).",

Thus, we do not have the ability to examine landscape\u2010level issues such as designing the optimum quantities of various successional stages and their spatial juxtapositions for maximizing biodiversity in the landscapes of U.S. dry forests. This is particularly problematic for comparisons of low/moderate\u2010severity fire and high\u2010severity fire, where most low/moderate severity fires were prescribed and occurred at smaller spatial extents, and most high\u2010severity fires were wildland fires burning at larger spatial extents. Related to landscape\u2010scale fire mosaics is the measurement of fire severity itself; going forward, we anticipate increased refinement of this issue to move from simple categorical classifications (high, moderate, low severity) to continuous variables determined from remotely sensed pre\u2013post fire vegetation change (Saab et al. 2007, Kotliar et al. 2008). Future work should address this shortcoming and expand the taxonomic base of investigation beyond birds and small mammals.

An emerging perspective (Donato et al. 2009b\n, Thompson and Spies 2009, Halofsky et al. 2011) is the importance and widespread occurrence of mixed\u2010severity wildfire. The juxtaposition and complex spatial pattern of extant forest and stand\u2010replacement patches over stand\u2010to\u2010watershed scales generates a mosaic supporting many more species than any single cover type. Combined with the temporal variation provided by forest succession after disturbance, mixed\u2010severity fire has the potential to create the landscape heterogeneity that could maximize availability of wildlife habitat to the broadest range of species (Fontaine et al. 2009). Future work emphasizing wildlife response in relation to burn patch size and landscape composition would be extremely valuable, both in assisting land managers planning fire or thinning activities and in understanding potential consequences of increased patch size under climate change scenarios that may increase the probability of high\u2010severity fire (Westerling et al. 2011).",

Generally, this was not a large issue because many of our data were obtained from the FFS network, where sites were preselected based on similarity of fire management issues and broadly similar fire regimes (McIver et al. 2008). However, some of the variation in our results may be attributed to these two factors, but we cannot evaluate the impact of this potential source of confounding variation on our results. Similarly, comparisons across treatments (i.e., Fig. 2, Table 3) required us to pool across species. Underlying bias may confound these comparisons if the species pool varies in its composition and thus life history and other attributes. However, the comparisons in Table 3, based on species in common across all three fire and fire surrogate treatments (low/moderate\u2010severity fire, thinning, thinning plus low/moderate\u2010severity fire) show little difference from the overall pairwise comparisons, suggesting that this source of bias was negligible.",

In many cases, it would seem reasonable to conclude that species probably are not sensitive to the treatments examined (e.g., Northern Flicker and low\u2010severity fire, N = 25; Table 1) but in others, this does not seem warranted where responses to related treatments reflect an effect (e.g., Red\u2010eyed Vireo response to thinning is neutral based on confidence interval overlap with zero, but is the same value as negative responses to prescribed fire and thinning plus fire; Table 1).

Although high\u2010severity (stand\u2010replacement) fire is the most long\u2010lasting disturbance type included in this study, much management interest surrounds the treatment lifetime of prescribed fire and the frequency with which it should be implemented, from both fire and ecosystem management perspectives (Finney et al. 2005). Engstrom et al. (1984) provide the only longer term data on this topic, but as the FFS research matures, we assume that more data will become available to address this important question. Also, despite the fact that the low\u2010severity treatment was the most data rich, we could not separate low/moderate\u2010severity prescribed fire and low/moderate\u2010severity wildland fire because the low/moderate\u2010severity wildland fire was restricted to a few studies (N = 5) with a narrow geographic scope (Rocky Mountain states). Thus, in this analysis we assume that vertebrates respond similarly to both types of low/moderate\u2010severity fire. We have demonstrated that low\u2010severity fire is not a surrogate for high\u2010severity fire, but future investigations should examine the degree to which prescribed fire mimics surface wildfires.",

There have been a few recent studies examining both repeated low\u2010severity prescribed fire (Whiting et al. 2007) and successive high\u2010severity fire events (Fontaine et al. 2009). The importance of surface fires in maintaining fire\u2010dependent species has been well documented (Engstrom et al. 1984), but the effect of variance in fire interval is uncertain; repeated high\u2010severity fires, particularly at shorter intervals that may occur in regions with rapid postfire vegetation recovery (Thompson et al. 2007), are not well understood.",

Within the suite of species examined, all response types were present, supporting the need for the presence of all forest development stages for maximizing wildlife diversity within a landscape. This study provides species\u2010level quantitative estimates of the effect of a range of widely used management techniques (thinning, prescribed fire) and widely occurring disturbances (wildland fire) over short time intervals (0\u20134 years) for a large number of vertebrate species. Thus, land management professionals may use these estimates and detailed information provided by Kennedy and Fontaine (2009) as a starting point to anticipate effects of wildland fire and fire\u2010based management prescriptions on wildlife in their project area, ideally within an adaptive management framework (Converse et al. 2006). Missing data on treatments and species of interest also serve to underscore the need for future work (e.g., mixed\u2010severity fire, herpetofauna).",

The manager's toolbox includes thinning, prescribed low\u2010severity fire, and wildland fire use. As Fule et al. (2004) observe, wildland fire use works well in some places, but in many other areas it is problematic. As such, prescribed fire of higher intensities, leading to greater levels of tree mortality and fuel consumption, is probably warranted in many forest types, particularly within the western United States. This would help to create a mixed\u2010severity mosaic that would include early\u2010successional habitats and their obligate vertebrate species at landscape and management unit (e.g., national forest) scales. In fire\u2010prone forests where wildland fire use or high\u2010intensity prescribed fire is not practical, our results suggest that thinning may be able to achieve stand\u2010scale wildlife\u2010oriented management goals.",
