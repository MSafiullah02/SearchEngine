            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major viral pathogen associated with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) among hospitalized children. In this study, the genetic diversity of the RSV strains was investigated among nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) taken from children less than 5 years of age hospitalized with ALRTIs in Hospital Serdang, Malaysia. A total of 165 NPA samples were tested for the presence of RSV and other respiratory viruses from June until December 2009. RSV was found positive in 83 (50%) of the samples using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further classification of 67 RSV strains showed that subgroups A and B comprised 11/67 (16.4%) and 56/67 (83.6%) of the strains, respectively. The second hypervariable region at the carboxyl-terminal of the G gene was amplified and sequenced in order to do phylogenetic study. The phylogenetic relationships of the samples were determined separately for subgroups A and B using neighbor joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP), and Bayesian inference (BI). Phylogenetic analysis of the 32 sequenced samples showed that all 9 RSV-A strains were clustered within NA1 genotype while the remaining 23 strains of the RSV-B subgroup could be grouped into a clade consisted of strains with 60-nucleotide duplication region. They were further classified into newly discovered BA10 and BA9 genotypes. The present finding suggests the emergence of RSV genotypes of NA1 and BA. This is the first documentation of the phylogenetic relationship and genetic diversity of RSV strains among hospitalized children diagnosed with ALRTI in Serdang, Malaysia.

            "text": "The role of the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been demonstrated as a major viral pathogen associated with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) and frequent cause of hospitalization among children less than 5 years. 1-4 RSV belongs to the genus Pneumovirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. The genome consists of nonsegmented single-stranded negative sense RNA that encodes 11 separate proteins, 8 of which are structural (L, G, F, N, P, M, M2-1, and SH) and 2 of which are nonstructural (NS1 and NS2, respectively). 5, 6 RSV was initially divided into 2 distinct major subgroups, A and B, using monoclonal antibodies against virus proteins. 7, 8 Nucleotide and amino acid (AA) sequence analysis showed that G protein is significantly more divergent than for other RSV proteins for both within and between major groups. 9 Extensive nucleotide and AA variability of the G protein suggests that the virus may reinfect people and cause yearly outbreaks through escaping previously induced immunity. 10, 11 Extracellular domain of the membrane-bound G protein contains two hypervariable regions separated by a conserved 13 AA motif among all strains. Nucleotide mutations are preferentially accumulated in these two hypervariable regions of the ectodomain. The second hypervariable region of the G protein ectodomain located at the C terminal region provides a reliable surrogate for the variability of the entire G gene. It has been used for phylogenetical and molecular epidemiological studies of the RSV. 10, 12 Being as a target for neutralizing antibody as well as a major constituent for protective antibody is considered another reason for sequence study of the G protein. 13 Phylogenetic analysis using G protein gene revealed that distinct genotypes consist of phyogenetically related strains. 10, 12 RSV group A has been clustered into 10 genotypes: GA1-GA7, SAA1, NA1, and NA2. 10, 12, 14, 15 For the classification of group B, the following genotypes have been proposed: BA1-BA10, GB1-GB4, and SAB1 to SAB3. 10, 12, 13, 16, 17 Determination of circulation pattern of strains is not easy because of continuous shifting in circulating strains, their multiplicity, and cocirculation during a given season. 14, [18] [19] [20] In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the genotype study and phylogenetic analysis of RSV strains. However, far too little attention has been paid to phylogenetic study of respiratory viruses in Malaysia. In the current study, we evaluated the genetic variability of the second hypervariable region of G protein gene and deduced AA sequence of both RSV A and B subgroups, detected from hospitalized children with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) in Serdang, Malaysia.",

            "text": "RSV subgroup B viruses are generally divided into the genotypes comprising nonduplicated regions (GB1-4 and SAB1-3) and genotypes with a duplicated segment namely BA genotype. Since the report of BA genotypes with 60-nucleotide insertions in the second hypervariable region of G gene by Trento, 17 the partial sequences of this genotype has been reported worldwide. 19, [33] [34] [35] [36] Results of different tree methods for RSV-B confirmed the K2P distance method and defined that the least mean intergenotype distance was found between genotypes with duplicated regions and UPM strains and the most mean intergenotype distance belonged to genotypes that were not duplicated. The Table 4 . rSV-B intergenotype pairwise distances from variation in g gene derived from the Kimura's 2-parameter methods. detection of the BA strains in this study further supports the widespread dissemination of the BA strains in the community. It was speculated that all BA genotypes with duplicated regions shared a common ancestor that was separate from other group B genotypes. 13 It was classified into BA-I to BA-VI using G protein gene analysis. Rapid generation of the genetic variation among BA strains is partly related to the immunological selection at duplicated regions in the ectodomain of the G protein. The fast dissemination of genotypes with duplicated regions may be related to the fact that the human immune system may not be exposed to these new genotypes. 13 In a detailed phylogenetic analysis of BA strains by Dapat in Japan, 37 additional new BA genotypes including BA7, BA8, BA9, and BA10 were introduced that were previously described as BA4 genoypes. These newly introduced genotypes comprised the majority of the RSV strains from 2005 to 2010. The different methods of phylogenetic trees largely supported that UPM B strains were separated into 2 different clades, namely BA9 and BA10 genotypes. These findings of the current study are consistent with the Dapat study, which found cocirculation of several BA genotypes in all studied periods with domination of 1 genotype in each season. The present finding seems to be also consistent with other research that found BA genotypes are replacing the previously dominant RSV B genotypes. 13, 35 Among all RSV-B sequenced strains, residue Thr229, located outside the duplicated portion was changed to the Ile. This change was not observed in other retrieved GenBank strains without duplicated regions. This finding is in agreement with Trento et al 13 who showed that T229I change occurred in all BA strains with duplicated regions. Consistence with that study, the S247P AA substitution was found in all B strains. The strains JQ933971, JQ933972, and JQ933973, which were classified in clad-included BA9 strains, had a substitution of V271A. Except for strain JQ933953, the rest of the strains clustered in the BA10 had a E292G change. Also E226D change was seen in JQ933961. The results are consistent with the study by Dapat. 37 However, other changes including T289I and S269P were not observed in this study. G protein length diversity due to the position of the final stop codon was observed among RSV B strains, which leads to a deduced G protein length of 312 or 319 amino acids.",

There is remarkably good agreement between the result of pairwise distance methods and molecular trees of different methods (BI, MP, and NJ). There is a remarkable match between the molecular phylogeny and genetic distance among UPM subgroup A and NA1 genotype in this study.

Host immune system evading and reinfections by RSV could be due to the within and between subgroup antigenic variations. 14 The presence of emerging viruses and the lack of relative protective immunity to the new strains may facilitate effective spread of these new strains. 12 The variation in the G protein length may contribute to the antigenic changes and escape from the immune system. 38 However, further studies are required to determine the role of the G protein length on RSV immunity. The findings obtained in this study have important implications for the understanding of the evolutionary pattern of RSV as well as vaccine development. Previous studies have shown that genotype shifting during consecutive years is a common feature of the molecular epidemiology of RSV infections. 12 However, caution must be taken as study at multiple locations and for several consecutive years with a large sample size is required to better appreciate the epidemiology of the RSV. Long-term epidemiological surveillance of RSV strains is important to illuminate antigenic and genetic bases of the infections by RSV.",
