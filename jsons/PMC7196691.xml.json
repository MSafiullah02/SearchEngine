Problems with respirator tolerability have been attributed to overall\ndiscomfort;(6\u201310) diminished visual,(8,\n11,\n12) vocal,(11,\n12) or\nauditory(11)\nacuity; excessive humidity(7) or heat;(7,\n10,\n12,\n13)\nheadaches,(6,\n14) facial\npressure;(7)\nskin irritation or itchiness;(6,\n7,\n12,\n13) excessive fatigue or\nexertion;(6,\n7,\n9,\n10,\n12,\n13)\nmalodorousness;(7,\n10) anxiety or\nclaustrophobia;(6,\n13,\n15,\n16) and other interferences\nwith occupational duties.(10,\n17\u201319) However, few studies have formally field\ntested the tolerability of respirators commonly worn by HCWs(1) who may be called on to wear\nrespiratory protection in extreme scenarios for the duration of their work shifts during a\nlarge-scale infectious disease outbreak.(5,\n20,\n21) The likelihood of U.S.\nhealth care workers tolerating respirators for 8 or more hours\nper day over the days and weeks of an evolving outbreak is\nunknown.",

Health care workers caring for\npatients with contagious life-threatening illnesses during a pandemic may be willing to\ntolerate respirators for longer periods than observed in our study, although subjects were\nasked to imagine themselves in such a setting. It is important to note that infection\ncontrol procedures and appropriate processes for disinfecting, charging, and maintaining\nrespirators would need to be considered if HCWs were to use respirators for extended wear\nperiods, with use between patients, and with respirator re-use. Likewise, appropriate hand\nhygiene and contact precautions should always be observed. A participation bias may have led\nto higher tolerance levels among the study subjects than would be expected in the U.S.\nhealth care work force. The most common reason for HCWs declining to participate was\nunwillingness to wear the respirator equipment for prolonged periods.",
