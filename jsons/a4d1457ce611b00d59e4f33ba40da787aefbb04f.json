PED virus (PEDV) spread for the first time into the USA in 2013 and has caused severe economic losses. Retrospectively, it was found that two different strains of PEDV have been introduced into the United States, both are closely related to strains circulating in China where a new wave of the disease occurred from 2010 onwards. Since autumn 2014, new outbreaks of PED have occurred in Europe. In this study, weaned piglets were inoculated with an early European isolate (Br1/87) or faecal/intestinal suspensions derived from pigs infected with a recent European strain of PEDV (from Germany) or a US strain of PEDV. No evidence for infection resulted from inoculation of pigs with the German sample that contained high levels of PEDV RNA; there were no clinical signs, excretion of viral RNA or anti-PEDV antibody production. In contrast, all the pigs in the other two groups showed evidence of infection. Mild clinical signs of disease, mainly diarrhoea, occurred in piglets inoculated with the Br1/87 and US PEDV strains. PEDV RNA was detected throughout the intestine in euthanized animals at 4 days postinoculation. In addition, within these animals, low levels of viral RNA were detected in lungs and livers with higher levels in spleens. Seroconversion against PEDV occurred in all surviving infected animals within 10 days. PEDV RNA excretion occurred for at least 2 weeks. The US PEDV RNA was detected at low levels in serum samples on multiple days. It is apparent that current diagnostic systems can detect infection by the different virus strains.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) was initially recognized in the UK in 1971 and is caused by infection with a coronavirus (PED virus), a member of the Alphacoronavirus genus. The disease is characterized by diarrhoea and vomiting leading to severe dehydration with high mortality among young piglets and hence severe economic losses. During the 1980s and 1990s, the disease spread within Europe and also to Asia and caused significant problems (reviewed in . A new wave of PED virus (PEDV) infections occurred from 2010 onwards in China and adjacent countries (Sun et al., 2012) and the virus appeared for the first time in the USA in 2013 (Chen et al., 2014) . Retrospectively, it has been shown that two closely related variants of PEDV, termed 'INDEL' and 'non-INDEL' that reflect the presence or absence of specific insertions and deletions within the S-gene sequence, were introduced into the United States at that time (Huang et al., 2013; Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014) . Recently, new cases of PED have occurred within several countries in Europe and the circulating viruses are genetically similar to the 'INDEL' strains found in the USA and China (Hanke et al., 2015) ; these viruses have been suggested to cause less severe disease than the 'non-INDEL' strains and this has been supported by recent experimental studies (Yamamoto et al., 2015) . However, it is apparent that the nature and severity of the disease can vary significantly even with apparently very similar virus strains and thus, other factors must also determine the outcome of the infection. These can include the age, immune status and general health status (EFSA (European Food Standards Agency), AHAW Panel (EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare), 2014). Sequence analysis of the recent PED viruses circulating in the United States, China and Europe has been reported (Chen et al., 2014; Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Hanke et al., 2015) . Some initial animal studies using the recent PEDV strains to determine the characteristics of the infection have been performed (Jung et al., 2014; Madson et al., 2014; Crawford et al., 2015; Yamamoto et al., 2015) and also previously animal experiments with an early European strain have been described (Debouck et al., 1981) .

However, it is clear that sufficient virus was present in the cell culture-grown Br1/87 isolate and in the US PEDV sample to cause infection in all of the inoculated animals. These infections were demonstrated by a variety of means including the appearance of fairly mild clinical disease, the presence of high levels of PEDV RNA in the intestine (at PID 4) or the prolonged excretion of PEDV RNA and the induction of anti-PEDV antibodies within 10 days post-inoculation. The time course of seroconversion is consistent with previous results using the US PEDV Crawford et al., 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2746, "end": 2768, "text": "Crawford et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the current study, faecal shedding of PEDV RNA was observed through to PID 18 in both infected Groups and faecal shedding of PEDV RNA has been reported to occur until PID 24 and even PID 42 but it is not known whether infectious virus is shed beyond PID 21 Crawford et al., 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 260, "end": 282, "text": "Crawford et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "PEDV RNA was detected in serum samples collected from pigs in Group 3 (US PEDV) on multiple days from PID 2 through to PID 14. A more restricted presence of PEDV RNA was apparent in the sera from the Br1/87 inoculated pigs (Group 1) with viral RNA mainly detected at PID 7. The presence of PEDV RNA in serum from acutely infected pigs has been reported previously (Jung et al., 2014 . A consistent observation is that the viral RNA was found at a very much lower level in serum than in faecal material and the RNA that is present in serum has not yet been shown to be within infectious virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 364, "end": 382, "text": "(Jung et al., 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In pigs euthanized at PID 4, both the Br1/87 and the US PEDV were found throughout the intestine. PEDV RNA was also detected in the spleens of some of these pigs (even in the absence of virus RNA in the serum) and the level of viral RNA in the spleen was higher than in liver or lungs. Thus, it does not seem possible to account for the level of viral RNA within the spleen by the presence of virus in the blood. In earlier studies, PEDV antigens were not detected by immunostaining within the spleen, liver or lungs of CV777-infected pigs (Debouck et al., 1981) or in lungs of PEDV PC21A-infected pigs (Jung et al., 2014) , but the sensitivity of the RT-qPCR assays used here is likely higher than the sensitivity of the immunostaining procedures. It has been reported (Park and Shin, 2014 ) that PEDV can replicate in pulmonary macrophages in vivo and thus extra-intestinal replication of PEDV seems possible . The results presented here indicate that the US PEDV produced slightly more severe clinical signs than the cell culturegrown Br1/87 strain. Furthermore, the duration and extent of virus excretion together with the presence of viremia were all more marked in the US PEDV inoculated Group. However, these differences may be due to use of the cell culture-grown virus (potentially adapted) compared with the field virus or possible differences in the level of infectious virus used for the inoculation rather than a real difference in properties of the strains.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 540, "end": 562, "text": "(Debouck et al., 1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 603, "end": 622, "text": "(Jung et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 770, "end": 790, "text": "(Park and Shin, 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Infection of piglets by the early European isolate of PEDV (Br1/87, a close relative of the CV777 strain) and by a US non-INDEL strain of the virus has been performed and it has been possible to monitor infection by each strain using a range of diagnostic assays for the presence of viral RNA and the induction of anti-PEDV antibodies. The mild clinical outcome observed in this study may be related to the age of piglets used. Newborn piglets appear most severely affected by the infection in the field, and hence, experimental infection of such piglets can be expected to produce a more severe disease and even mortality. Indeed, the outcome of PEDV infections in pigs appears to be dependent upon a range of factors (see EFSA, AHAW Panel (EFSA Panel on Animal Health and Welfare), 2014).
