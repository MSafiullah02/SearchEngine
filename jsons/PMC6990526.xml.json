            "text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a double-stranded DNA virus in the herpes virus family [1]. CMV is considered an important opportunistic virus among immunocompromised individuals. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, immunosuppressive state, long-term steroid or immunomodulator use, and/or organ transplantation are more susceptible to this opportunistic pathogen [2\u20134]. CMV infection can affect several organs, but gastrointestinal (GI) involvement is one of the most common [5]. GI-CMV manifestations include dysphagia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and upper or lower GI bleeding [3]. GI-CMV infection in immunocompetent patients was at one time rare; however, there has been an increasing number of case reports and case series of GI-CMV infection in immunocompetent patients, especially among the elderly and critically ill patients [6\u201328]. Nevertheless, data specific to GI-CMV infection in immunocompetent patients are still quite limited. Only three cohorts comprehensively described risk factors, clinical manifestations, and clinical course [7, 27, 28], and one of those studies included patients taking corticosteroids [27]. This could lead to disease under-recognition, which could result in diagnostic delay and poorer outcomes. Enhanced understanding of GI-CMV infection in immunocompetent patients will improve diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes.",

However, CMV has been reported to cause severe infection in immunocompetent patients, and the GI tract was the most frequent site of infection [33].

Advanced age is one of the most important risk factors. The immunocompetent patients in our cohort had a mean age of 73 years, which is comparable to the mean age of patients in other cohorts [7, 14\u201316, 27, 28]. Some underlying diseases may be associated with CMV reactivation. We found that about one-third of our immunocompetent patients had diabetes mellitus (DM) or large vessel atherosclerosis disease, both of which were found to be significantly higher than in the immunocompromised group. A significant proportion of immunocompetent patients in other cohorts were also reported to have these conditions [7, 16, 27, 28, 31]. Chronic kidney disease was found in about 23% of our immunocompetent patients. Although this prevalence was not significantly different between groups in our study, chronic kidney disease was also found to be quite common in other cohorts, with a prevalence ranging from 14 to 50% [7, 14, 16, 27, 28, 31]. Uremia and dialysis may cause dysfunction of B-cell and T-cell lymphocytes, impaired cytokine regulation, and perturbation of mucosal immunity [34]. Interestingly, cirrhosis does not seem to be a risk factor for development of GI-CMV disease. The prevalence of cirrhosis among GI-CMV was reported to range from 0 to 5.9% [7, 16, 27, 28, 31]. Severe critical illness can cause immune paralysis that was reported to be associated with CMV reactivation [35]. Many studies, including ours, found and reported that 20\u2013100% of patients were in an ICU setting [7, 16, 27].",

In our study and in other cohorts, the majority of immunocompetent patients presented with gastrointestinal bleeding [7, 16, 27, 28], while diarrhea was the most common presentation in immunocompromised patients [7]. It is known that CMV can infect vascular endothelium resulting in ischemic damage to the mucosa that causes bleeding [36]. In immunocompetent patients, the ischemic process may be potentiated by hypoperfusion state caused by underlying conditions, and this may cause more bleeding. The endoscopic finding of the \u201csingle-stripe sign\u201d, which is normally observed in patients with ischemic colitis, was found in some GI-CMV patients and supports this hypothesis (Fig. 1b). Concomitant CMV infection in other organs is extremely rare. Neither our study nor any of the other previous case series found any cases of concomitant CMV infection in other organs [7, 14, 16, 27, 28]. In contrast, concomitant CMV infection in other organs was reported in 7% of immunocompromised patients. This suggests a hypothesis that CMV reactivation in immunocompetent host is a local reactivation rather than a systemic reactivation. This hypothesis could be supported by the results of blood tests for viremia since as high as 40\u201375% of patients had negative test for viremia, either by Ag detection or by CMV viral load [7, 27, 28].",
