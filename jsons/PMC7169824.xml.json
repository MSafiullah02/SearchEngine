            "text": "This Personal Account describes three translational research projects that were carried out in our laboratories that involved the discovery of bioactive compounds or lead compounds for the treatment of AD, breast cancer, and viral infections. About 35 million people worldwide suffer from AD and the currently available treatments for AD, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and memantine, temporarily ameliorate some of the symptoms but do not modify the underlying disease. As such, there is an urgent need and challenge for the discovery of new drugs that treat this disease. We have discovered a newclass of tricyclic pyrones that possess high oral bioavailability, excellent permeability through the blood/brain barrier, and low toxicity; these pyrones substantially decrease the number of soluble and insoluble A\u03b2 species in the brain and preserve memory and motor functions in AD transgenic mice. Tumor cells have impeded or altered cell\u2010to\u2010cell communication; one type of cell\u2010cell communication is through a gap junction. We synthesized a library of substituted quinolines and found that several compounds possessed potent inhibitory activity against T47D breast\u2010cancer cells through the enhancement of gap\u2010junctional intercellular communication (GJIC); these compounds reduced xenografted breast tumors in mice and completely eradicated tumor formation in spontaneous transgenic mammary mice. Viral infections, including influenza, are responsible for over 3 million cases of illness and up to half a million deaths per year. Although antiviral drugs against certain viral infections are available, the emergence of viral resistance to existing antiviral drugs emphasizes the demand for the development of new antiviral drugs. We have synthesized and bioevaluated several classes of antiviral compounds, including triacsin C analogues, ACAT inhibitors, and antioxidant quercetin analogues.",

            "text": "AD, which is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. More than 5 million Americans and 35 million people worldwide suffer from AD. At present, available treatments for AD temporarily alleviate some of the symptoms but do not treat or cure the underlying disease.\n[1]\n The causes of AD remain elusive. The initial cholinergic hypothesis (decrease of the synthesis of neurotransmitter acetylcholine) cannot completely explain the pathogenesis. Amyloid and tau hypotheses have received the most attention. Brains of patients with AD present two classical lesions: Extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Aggregates of amyloid\u2010\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide, a 39\u201343 residue protein, are widely considered to initiate a cascade of molecular changes that lead to AD.\n[2]\n The production of A\u03b2 results from the sequential proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2\u2010 and \u03b3\u2010secretases. Presenilins are a major component of \u03b3\u2010secretase and comprise two isoforms, presenilin (PS)\u20101 and \u20102. Most autosomal\u2010dominant familial forms of AD are attributed to mutations in APP, PS\u20101, and PS\u20102.\n[3]\n Emerging evidence supports the conclusion that soluble oligomers of A\u03b2\u2013but not monomers or insoluble amyloid fibrils\u2013may be the primary toxic amyloids that cause synaptic dysfunctions in brains and animal models with AD.\n[2]\n Low\u2010n\u2010oligomers, such as A\u03b2 dimers, or high\u2010n\u2010oligomers, such as the 12 mer A\u03b2*56, were implicated in directly causing the impairment of synaptic plasticity and memory.\n[4]\n Most cases of AD, however, are sporadic (late onset). The major genetic risk factors include the inheritance of \u03b54 allele\n[5]\n of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene\u2010encoding APOE, which increases the risk of AD 3\u2010fold in heterozygotes and 15\u2010fold in homozygotes,\n[6]\n thus suggesting an important role of cholesterol homeostasis in AD. Major strategies for experimental disease\u2010modifying therapies include targeting multiple sites in the metabolism of A\u03b2 (synthesis, aggregation, deposition, and clearance), targeting tau (inhibition of tau phosphorylation, prevention of tau aggregation and/or disaggregation of tau aggregates), regulating cholesterol levels, anti\u2010excitotoxicity, anti\u2010inflammation, and modulating calcium homeostasis, among others.\n[7]\n Because there are no FDA\u2010approved drugs that can delay or halt the progression of the disease, a major focus of AD research is on the development of drug\u2010targeting amyloid or tau. Our research goals have, therefore, been the discovery and development of new molecules that can slow or reverse AD progression by reducing amyloid pathology and maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in the brain. In our studies of the synthesis of new acyl\u2010CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors based on natural product pyripyropene A,\n[8]\n we synthesized a new class of tricyclic pyrone molecules that contained three of the four rings of the pyripyropene nucleus.[\n[9] \n, \n[10] \n, \n[11] \n, \n[12] \n, \n[13] \n, \n[14] \n, \n[15] \n, \n[16] \n, \n[17] \n] Based on our initial screening results of various tricyclic pyrone molecules by using MC65 cells and computational docking experiments with A\u03b2 fibrils, CP2 (code name) and its analogues were designed. ACAT converts membrane cholesterol into cytoplasmic cholesteryl\u2010ester droplets for storage and ACAT inhibitors have been implicated in anti\u2010atherosclerosis and in the reduction of amyloid pathology by regulating cholesterol homeostasis.[\n[18] \n, \n[19] \n, \n[20] \n] Tricyclic pyrone molecules, such as CP2, were synthesized in four steps:[\n[9] \n, \n[12] \n] 1) The condensation of commercially available 4\u2010hydroxy\u20106\u2010methyl\u20102\u2010pyrone (1) with (S)\u2010perillaldehyde (2); 2) selective hydroboration of the resulting tricyclic pyrone (3) with borane, followed by treatment with hydrogen peroxide; 3) mesylation with methanesulfonyl chloride; and 4) a displacement reaction with adenine (Figure 1). A single enantiomer of compound 3 was formed from the condensation reaction. However, a 1 : 1 mixture of two diastereomers, which possessed R and S configurations at the C12 position, was produced during the hydroboration process in the synthesis of CP2. We have synthesized a library of over 100 tricyclic pyrone (TP) molecules, screened them for neuronal\u2010protective activities by using MC65 cells that were induced with A\u03b2 oligomers,[\n[13] \n, \n[14] \n, \n[15] \n] and identified the seven most\u2010active compounds, including CP2 and TP4, with the minimum effective dosage for 50% cell survival, ED50 values in the range 70\u2013210 nm, and TD50 (toxic effect for 50% cell death in the presence of tetracycline) values in the range 14\u201377 \u00b5m. The therapeutic index (TI or therapeutic ratio = TD50/ED50) values for CP2 and TP4 are 325 and 296, respectively. MC65 is a line of human neuroblastoma that conditionally expresses C99, a 99\u2010residue carboxyl terminal fragment that is derived from the \u03b2\u2010secretase cleavage of APP. C99 is subsequently cleaved by \u03b3\u2010secretase to generate A\u03b2. Significant loss of cell viability occurs after 48 h following transgene induction (in the absence of tetracycline). Cell death is not caused by factors in the media, including secreted A\u03b2.[\n[13] \n, \n[14] \n] We demonstrated that cell death is dependent on the cellular production and the accumulation of A\u03b2, possibly in aggregated forms that are present as SDS\u2010stable A\u03b2 oligomeric complexes. MC65 cells are easily propagated and the cell toxicity is measured quantitatively by a simple 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.",

            "text": "To understand the mechanism of action of this class of compounds, we used surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy to show that TP compounds bind to A\u03b242 oligomers, atomic force microscopy to reveal that TP compounds inhibit the aggregation of A\u03b242 peptide and disaggregate A\u03b242 oligomers and protofibrils in real time, circular dichroism to monitor A\u03b242 protein conformations (in the presence of TP, A\u03b242 peptide remains as random coil structure), and protein quantification to verify that TP compounds inhibit the formation of A\u03b242 fibrils.[\n[14] \n, \n[15] \n] Moreover, from cell studies, we found that TPs reduce the accumulation of A\u03b2 peptides and A\u03b2 oligomers,\n[14]\n normalize cholesterol level in cells,\n[17]\n and inhibit ACAT activity and increase cholesterol\u2010transporter gene ABCA1, thereby resulting in the modulation of cholesterol efflux in MC65 neurons.\n[21]\n These in\u2010solution and cell\u2010based studies suggest that TP compounds possess anti\u2010amyloid properties and modulate cholesterol homeostasis in neurons. For instance, CP2 was found to inhibit ACAT with an IC50 value of 1.2 \u00b5m and increase the ABCA1 cholesterol\u2010transporter gene with an EC50 value of 0.9 \u00b5m. Other active TP compounds have similar or greater IC50 values for ACAT inhibition and EC50 values in enhancing the ABCA1 gene. We also investigated the effects of TP compounds on basal neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in rat\u2010hippocampal slices from the measurement of LTP. We found that the addition of amyloid \u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2O) blocked LTP induction on the nanomolar range. Perfusion of a TP compound (1 \u00b5m) prior to the co\u2010application of A\u03b2O restored LTP to the non\u2010A\u03b2O\u2010treated level. Moreover, TP alone also significantly enhanced the magnitude of LTP, without affecting basal synaptic activity, thus implying that TP can block A\u03b2O\u2010induced toxicity and preserve hippocampal synaptic plasticity. TP compounds appear to possess multiple beneficial effects.",

From octanol/water partition experiments, log P values of 2.20 and 1.90 were obtained for CP2 and TP4, respectively, which suggest that CP2 and TP4 readily enter the brain. Furthermore, by performing liquid scintillation analysis of the radioactivity of CP2 in the brain after i.p. injection of 14C\u2010labeled CP2 into C57BL/6 mice, we found that CP2 readily entered the brain after only a short amount of time (3\u201330 min).\n[14]\n We also used the ALOGPS 2.1 program to calculate log P values for CP2 and TP4, as well as other TP compounds, and their average log P values were in the range 1.91 (\u00b1 1.10) to 1.83 (\u00b1 1.13). These calculated log P values indicate that other TP compounds have similar brain\u2010capillary permeabilities as CP2 and TP4 and should, therefore, also readily penetrate the blood/brain barrier (BBB). Because oral administration would be ideal for future therapeutic applications, we determined the amount of CP2, along with several other active TP compounds, in the plasma and brain after oral gavage administration in C57Bl/6 mice. A known amount of 1,2,4,5\u2010benzenetetracarboxylic acid (BTA, as an internal standard) was added to the plasma or tissue. TP and BTA were extracted from the plasma or brain tissue (from mice) with EtOAc/1\u2010propanol (9 : 1). The extract (which contained BTA and TP) was subjected to HPLC analysis and the amount of TP was deduced from the ratio of the integrated peaks of BTA and TP from the HPLC trace. Our results showed that the concentrations of CP2 reached 200 and 300 \u00b5m in the brain after 0.5 and 2 h, respectively, following administration at 25 mg kg\u20101, thus indicating good BBB penetration. Other TP compounds have similar concentrations in the brain to that of CP2.",

GJ is an intercellular membrane channel and GJ channels contain one or more different connexin (Cx) proteins to form gap\u2010junction plaques, which are large clusters of gap junctions with up to 10,000 channels.[\n[23] \n, \n[24] \n]Figure 3 shows the topology of Cx, along with a GJ channel.\n[25]\n Six Cxs aggregate to form a hemichannel, or connexon, and each hemichannel docks to another on an adjacent cell to form a dodecameric GJ channel. Channel activity can be measured by the passage of a small dye molecule (molecular weight <1000 Da) from one cell to another. It has been shown that defects in GJIC may be involved in the carcinogenesis process\n[26]\n and GJs are frequently decreased or absent in cancer cells. The loss of GJIC during carcinogenesis may not result from the direct disruption of a specific connexin gene or mRNA levels. Cx is synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum and is transported through the Golgi apparatus and trans\u2010Golgi network into the plasma membrane. When Cx reaches the plasma membrane, it oligomerizes into connexons. Newly synthesized connexons are added onto the peripheries of existing gap junctions and dock with connexons in the adjacent cell. Connexons are degraded by phosphorylation with protein kinase C (PKC)\n[27]\n or mitogen\u2010activated protein kinases (MAPK) at serine residue 368 of Cx43 (molecular weight: 43 KDa), followed by ubiquitination. The phosphorylation step results in an altered conformation, Cx43, and Nedd4 binds to the altered connexin and recruits ubiquitin, thereby leading to the ubiquitination of Cx43 and disassembling of connexon.\n[28]\n Furthermore, PKC\u03b1 over\u2010expression has been shown to cause tumor growth and tumor resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Multiple in vitro studies confirm the loss of connexin and/or GJIC in breast\u2010cancer cells and significantly, increase cell\u2010cell communication in Cx43\u2010overexpressing tumor cells, which enhances drug sensitivity.\n[29]\n\n",

Lipogenetic enzymes include fatty\u2010acid synthase (FASN), ACSL 1\u20136, diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 1 and 2, and Acyl\u2010CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) 1 and 2.\n[36]\n Because commercially available inhibitors of FASN, ACSL, DGAT, and ACAT were found to significantly reduce the replication of rotaviruses in vitro by our collaborator, Kyeong\u2010Ok Chang, we investigated analogues of triacsin C (TCs), which is a fungal metabolite from Streptomyces aureofaciens,\n[39]\n that showed the most\u2010potent inhibition of rotavirus replication. Overexpression and/or activation of lipogenic enzymes are found in most cancers;\n[40]\n hence, ACSL inhibitors may be useful in the reduction of cancer growth. The synthetic sequence of TC compounds is straightforward and efficient (Figure 6),\n[36]\n which provides flexibility for further optimization. Starting from known aldehyde 7,\n[39]\n TC19 and TC20 were synthesized and evaluated along with their analogues. Notably, triacsin C is a difficult compound to prepare and sufficient amounts are not available for in vivo study. Among triacsin C and its analogues, TC20 is the most potent against rotavirus replication with an ED50 value (the effective dose that reduces 50% of virus replication) of 0.1 \u00b5m. Therefore, TC analogues may be useful as lead compounds for rotavirus infection and possibly cancer therapy and lipogenic enzymes, such as ACSL may represent potential therapeutic targets.",

At present, there are no specific drugs for the treatment of norovirus infection. Because noroviruses do not grow in a cell culture, show high diversity, and demonstrate immunity to heterologous strains, the development of a vaccine has faced stiff challenges and is currently unavailable. By performing DNA microarray analysis of norovirus replicon\u2010harboring cells (HG23) by an Affymetrix Gene Chip in collaboration with Kyeong\u2010Ok Chang, increases in ACAT\u20101 and other cholesterol modulating genes (> \u00b11.5 fold) were found. Hence, a library of ACAT inhibitors, pyranobenzopyrones compounds (PBs), was synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activities of HG23 cells.\n[37]\n Compounds PB45, PB63, and PB78 possess the strongest activities among the tested library of over 120 compounds. Their ED50 and TI values are listed in Figure 5. Because these ED50 values are in the low micromolar range, further investigation of this class of compounds is needed to improve their potency.",
