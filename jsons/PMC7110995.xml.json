CPV type 2 emerged in 1970s, but few years later this type was replaced by a new genetic variants, called CPV-2a, -2b and -2c [22]. The predisposing factors and clinical relevance of CPV are well described [4], [7], [11]. It is also known that CPV induces suppression of the immune system and thus may facilitate infection with other agents [3], but the role of bacterial enteropathogens in CPV-infected dogs is still poorly understood.",

At this time, this synergism has not been confirmed, as there were no virulence markers to differentiate when C. perfringens is present as part of the microbiota or as an enteropathogen. Previous studies have shown an association between isolation of C. perfringens cpe\n+ (also referred as enterotoxigenic C. perfringens) and diarrhea, suggesting that enterotoxin (CPE) might be involved in CPAD in dogs. However, enterotoxigenic C. perfringens or CPE can be found in healthy dogs. Thus, although these methods could suggest that C. perfringens is involved, they are not confirmatory [30]. Recently, studies have shown that two pore-forming toxins (NetE, NetF) present in C. perfringens type A strains are strongly associated with canine hemorrhagic gastroenteritis [8], [14], suggesting these toxin-encoding genes could be used as virulence markers to diagnose CPAD in dogs.",

It is still controversial whether C. difficile is a primary or secondary agent in canine diarrhea [19], as other enteropathogens, including CPV, have been isolated in dogs diagnosed with CDI [9].

In addition, 20 random CPV positive samples were selected for VP2 sequencing, as described previously [1]. Briefly, PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter Company, Beverly, Massachusetts, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and each product was sequenced in both directions using primers the 554F and 555R, and the Big Dye V3.1 Terminator Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) using an ABI 3500 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, California, USA).

Forty dogs (48.8%) were positive for C. perfringens type A, but only three strains were also positive for the enterotoxin-encoding gene (cpe) (Table 2\n). One of these strains was also positive for netE and netF. The stool sample of this dog was positive for CPE in the commercial EIA kit. Two out of the three dogs positive for enterotoxigenic C. perfringens, including the one positive for C. perfringens netF\n+, survived after treatment. C. difficile was isolated from ten (12.2%) dogs, but only one (1.2%) strain was toxigenic (A + B + CDT-) (Table 2). This stool sample was also positive for A/B toxins in EIA. This dog also recovered after treatment. No dog was simultaneously positive for CDI and enterotoxigenic C. perfringens in the present study.",

Conversely, previous studies have shown a putative association between isolation of C. perfringens cpe\n+ and diarrhea, suggesting that the CPE might be at least partially responsible for CPAD in dogs [2], [18], [21], [29], [33], [37]. In the present study, almost half of the dogs were positive for C. perfringens type A, but only three of these isolates (3.6%) were positive for the enterotoxin-encoding gene (cpe). Among these three enterotoxigenic C. perfringens isolates, two were negative for netE and netF. These two dogs were puppies aged three and six months old, and were negative for CPE in their stool samples. Previous studies have shown an association between isolation of enterotoxigenic C. perfringens and canine diarrhea, but it is known that these strains can be isolated from healthy dogs. Thus, although these methods could suggest that C. perfringens is involved, they are not confirmatory [30]. More recently, two pore-forming toxins (NetE and NetF) that are always present in C. perfringens type A cpe\n+ strains, were recently described in a strong association with fatal canine hemorrhagic gastroenteritis [14]. In the present study, one of the three enterotoxigenic C. perfringens isolates was also positive for netE and netF. This sample was obtained from an adult dog, aged two years old. So far, C. perfringens netE\n+ strains were exclusively recovered from diarrheic adult dogs elsewhere [8], [14], which corroborates our findings. In addition, the stool sample of this dog was positive for CPE in EIA. Together, these results strongly suggest that this adult dog was simultaneously infected with CPV and C. perfringens cpe\n+\nnetE\n+.",

However, the sequencing of VP2 revealed the involvement of CPV-2b, the same type that is commonly found in Brazilian CPV vaccines. It is hard to hypothesize, then, which of these two enteropathogens (enterotoxigenic C. perfringens netE+ and CPV) might have initiated the disease.

Infection by other enteropathogens, including CPV, has been also suggested as a risk factor for CPAD in dogs [32], [34]. So far, this speculation is based only on findings from case reports and the current study is the first that focuses specifically on CPV-infected dogs. Our findings showed, for the first time, that C. perfringens type A cpe\n+ and also netE\n+ could be detected in CPV infected dogs. Due to few studies screening healthy and diarrheic dogs for major enteropathogens, including CPV and C. perfringens, it is difficult to evaluate this data and to establish comparisons, once previous studies focused only on the isolation of C. perfringens, rarely testing the C. perfringens isolates for cpe.

            "text": "Only one animal, aged two months old, was positive for toxigenic C. difficile (A + B + CDT-) in the present study (Table 2). The detection of A/B toxins in the stool sample of this animal confirmed that this dog was not only shedding this bacterium, but was also suffering from CDI. There are several reports of enteric disorders caused by C. difficile in dogs, ranging from chronic cases to an outbreak of acute diarrhea in a Veterinary Hospital [36], [38]. In addition, studies screening for multiple canine enteropathogens commonly show an association between diarrhea and isolation of toxigenic C. difficile or detection of A/B toxins in dogs, suggesting that this agent is an important enteropathogen in this domestic species [13], [18], [29]. However, the main predisposing factors involved are still largely unknown [26]. In humans, CDI is commonly a nosocomial infection associated with antibiotic therapy [15], whereas in dogs, although antibiotic therapy is known to increase the risk of colonization by C. difficile, most studies reported community-acquired infection in companion animals [9], [26], [36]. Corroborating these reports, the dog diagnosed with CDI in the present study was sampled at the time of admission, and was not under antibiotic therapy before stool collection.",
