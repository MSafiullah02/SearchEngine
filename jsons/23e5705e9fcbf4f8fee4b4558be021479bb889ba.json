Due to the strong infectivity of COVID-19 and lack of experience of performing an autopsy to infectious disease-induced death, the pandemic created some challenges for forensic practitioners. In this article, we summarize the experience of how we handle the confirmed or suspected infectious cases, and give some perspectives for the future.",

Due to the characteristics of strong infectivity, long incubation period, over 693,224 cases have been confirmed in the whole world and led to at least 33,106 death by the end of March 2020 [1] . The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the COVID-19 outbreak can be characterized as a \"pandemic\" as the virus spreads increasingly worldwide [2] . The Chinese government reacted quickly and took effective measures to deal with the pandemic [3] . During the past three months, this highly contagious pandemic also created some challenges for forensic practitioners in China [4, 5] . It is important for forensic practitioners to increase protection awareness and accumulate experience in the medicolegal death investigation of infectious diseases.",
