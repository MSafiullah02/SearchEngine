We present an effi cient and reproducible protocol for extracting RNA from feces and nasopharyngeal swab samples for BCoV diagnosis . This protocol, which we call phenol chloroform silica method, is based on cellular lysis and protein denaturation by SDS and phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol treatment followed by nucleic acid purifi cation by the guanidinium thiocyanate and silica [ 14 ] . Guanidinium thiocyanate is an excellent protein denaturant and hence very effective in inactivating nucleases.

This indicates that there is more available RNA for the N gene than for the other BCoV protein genes. Consequently, detection of the N gene RNA might be advantageous due to its high abundance in cells, facilitating a high sensitivity of the diagnostic technique. 5.
