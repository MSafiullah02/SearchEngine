On examination, he was febrile to 39.4\u00b0C (102.9\u00b0F), in moderate respiratory distress, and had oxyhemoglobin desaturation. COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive PCR test result obtained via a nasopharyngeal swab, and he was started on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Over the next 2 days, he continued to develop worsening hypoxemia, bilateral chest infiltrates (Fig 1\n), and accessory muscle fatigue requiring intubation and transfer to the medical ICU. There, he was diagnosed with ARDS and treated with low tidal volume ventilation, prone positioning, and a bumetanide drip. On day 4 of admission (9 days after symptom onset), he developed septic shock and was started on a norepinephrine drip. Given this decompensation and increasing inflammatory markers (Table 1\n), he was treated with a dose of tocilizumab (400 mg IV). The next day the patient developed ST segment depression in leads V4-V6 on ECG and increased troponin levels, which peaked at 30.39 ng/mL. ECG revealed mild global hypokinesis, and a diagnosis of viral myocarditis was made. Swan-Ganz catheter measurements confirmed a reduced cardiac index. The next day the patient developed a fever of 109\u00b0F and indexes of septic shock (normal cardiac index and reduced systemic vascular resistance) refractory to four vasopressor agents and passed away. Repeat laboratory measures (Table 1) suggested the development of sHLH (cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase, hypofibrinogenemia). This decompensation occurred despite a decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) after tocilizumab therapy.",

On examination, she was febrile to 100.5\u00b0F, not in any respiratory distress, and her oxyhemoglobin saturation was 96% on room air. A CT scan revealed diffuse bilateral nodular opacities (Fig 1). COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive PCR test result obtained via a nasopharyngeal swab and she was started on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. On hospital day 2 (7 days after symptom onset), she rapidly progressed into acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and septic shock. She was intubated, started on norepinephrine, and treated with a dose of tocilizumab (560 mg IV). On day 3, her shock worsened, requiring the maximum dose of three vasopressor agents, and she was started on stress dose steroids. Concurrently, she went into acute kidney injury requiring continuous venovenous hemodialysis. On day 4 (9 days after symptom onset), her inflammatory markers continued to increase (Table 2\n) and she was treated with a second dose of tocilizumab (700 mg IV). Despite the second dose, her clinical status worsened as she developed sHLH (cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase, hypofibrinogenemia) and passed away. As in case 1, these developments occurred despite a decrease in CRP after tocilizumab therapy.",

In addition, we report viral myocarditis development in one patient posttreatment. Interestingly, the clinical decompensations occurred despite a dramatic decrease in the IL-6 surrogate, CRP, posttreatment. These findings substantiate a report from Wuhan, China in which four of seven critically ill patients treated with tocilizumab died or experienced disease aggravation despite improvement in CRP.9 Our report further challenges the clinical usefulness of anti-IL-6 therapy in the treatment of COVID-19-induced CRS.",

Evidence suggests that a deficient T-cell response underlies the severity of COVID-19. CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell levels are decreased in patients with COVID-19 and correlate with severity of disease.6 Moreover, diabetes, which is associated with T-cell-mediated immunosuppression, is a risk factor for COVID-19.10 IL-6 promotes immature thymocyte differentiation into cytotoxic T cells and is needed for B-cell production of IgM and IgG.8 Thus, it is possible that elevated IL-6 levels are a compensatory mechanism for an impaired, virally directed cytotoxic T-cell response. Thus decreasing IL-6 levels in COVID-19 may promote increased viral replication if tocilizumab is used too early in the disease course. In fact, viral replication has been found as late as 22 days after symptom onset.11 In our first case, the patient developed viral myocarditis, an established presentation of severe COVID-19 on day 10 after symptom onset.12\n,\n13 We fear that tocilizumab may have been responsible for the development of viral myocarditis. This notion is further supported by decreased lymphocyte counts posttreatment in both the patients, suggesting decreased IL-6-mediated lymphocyte maturation.",

Along with IL-6, circulating levels of IL-2, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 are all elevated in patients with severe COVID-19.6 Of these, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 are classically involved in CRS and sHLH. Immunomodulating therapies may need to target multiple cytokines to treat COVID-19 CRS. Given the fear of increased viral replication, there is a need to know when it would be safe to give alternative, stronger, and/or broader immunosuppressant therapies.",

Although off-label use based on hypothetical benefit may drive the use of this and other drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic, there must be recognition that the true clinical benefits of untested medications are unknown. However, several clinical trials are actively recruiting subjects to determine the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in adult patients.15, 16, 17, 18 These clinical trials will further elucidate the effects of tocilizumab on COVID-19-induced organ failure and mortality and correlate these outcomes with inflammatory marker trends. Our report highlights that off-label drugs are best used in the context of a randomized clinical trial, where the timing of tocilizumab administration in the disease course and indications based on clinical parameters and biomarkers can be determined.",
