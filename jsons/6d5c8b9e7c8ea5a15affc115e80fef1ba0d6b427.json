Objectives: We sought to examine the role of HRV infection in infant respiratory tract illness and assess viral and host risk factors for HRV-associated disease severity. Methods: We used a prospective cohort of term, previously healthy infants enrolled during an inpatient or outpatient visit for acute upper or lower respiratory tract illness during the fallspring months of 2004-2008. Illness severity was determined by using an ordinal bronchiolitis severity score, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. HRV was identified by means of real-time RT-PCR. The VP4/VP2 region from HRV-positive specimens was sequenced to determine species. Results: Of 630 infants with bronchiolitis or upper respiratory tract illnesses (URIs), 162 (26%) had HRV infection; HRV infection was associated with 18% of cases of bronchiolitis and 47% of cases of URI. Among infants with HRV infection, 104 (64%) had HRV infection alone. Host factors associated with more severe HRV-associated illness included a maternal and family history of atopy (median score of 3.5 [interquartile range [IQR], 1.0-7.8] vs 2.0 [IQR, 1.0-5.2] and 3.5 [IQR, 1.0-7.5] vs 2.0 [IQR, 0-4.0]). In adjusted analyses maternal history of atopy conferred an increase in the risk for more severe HRVassociated bronchiolitis (odds ratio, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.14-4.99; P 5 .02). In a similar model maternal asthma was also associated with greater HRV-associated bronchiolitis severity (odds ratio, 2.49, 95% CI, 1.10-5.67; P 5 .03). Among patients with HRV infection, 35% had HRVA, 6% had HRVB, and 30% had HRVC. Conclusion: HRV infection was a frequent cause of bronchiolitis and URIs among previously healthy term infants requiring hospitalization or unscheduled outpatient visits. Substantial viral genetic diversity was seen among the patients with HRV infection, and predominant groups varied by season and year. Host factors, including maternal atopy, were associated with more severe infant HRV-associated illness. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2011;127:883-91.) ",

            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most common viral cause of asthma exacerbations in adults and children, 1-10 and wheezing with HRV infection during infancy has been linked to the onset of asthma. [10] [11] [12] Although it is well recognized that the majority of upper respiratory tract illness (URI) episodes in adults and children are associated with HRV infection, HRV historically have not been thought to play a significant role in infant respiratory tract illness or morbidity. During recent years, in studies with sensitive RT-PCR, HRVs have been associated with a significant burden of disease in infants and young children. [13] [14] [15] Bronchiolitis, a lower respiratory tract infection in infants presenting with wheezing, rales, and respiratory distress, has typically been associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, 14, 16 but a number of studies suggest that HRVs are another important cause of bronchiolitis. 13, 15, [17] [18] [19] Host factors for HRV-associated illness are poorly defined compared with those for RSV-induced illness. Copenhaver et al 20 found that among high-risk infants of atopic parents, day care attendance and siblings were risk factors for HRV-associated wheezing. However, the spectrum of HRV-associated illness among infants who are not at high risk for atopy and host and viral risk factors for HRV-associated infant bronchiolitis are not well defined. Some viral factors important in childhood respiratory morbidity have recently been elucidated in relation to wheezing illnesses in older children. These recent studies have found that a novel group of HRVs, called HRVC, is associated with a substantial burden of respiratory tract illness in sick children. 1, 13, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] We sought to assess the importance of HRVs, including HRVC, as a cause of URI or bronchiolitis among term, non-low birth weight, previously healthy infants without known risk factors for bronchiolitis and to examine host and viral factors that might contribute to HRV pathogenesis. A better understanding of host and viral risk factors for HRV-associated infant morbidity will have implications not only for understanding HRV pathogenesis but for treatment and disease prevention strategies.",

The primary goals of the cohort are to investigate the acute and long-term health consequences of varying severity and cause of viral respiratory tract infections and other environmental exposures on the outcomes of allergic rhinitis and early childhood asthma and to identify the profile of children at greatest risk of asthma after infant respiratory tract viral infection. 32 Infants aged less than 12 months were enrolled at the time of a clinical visit (hospitalization, emergency department visit, or outpatient visit) for bronchiolitis or URI from Fall through Spring, 2004-2008. Repeat infections were not included. Demographic and clinical data were collected, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained by trained nurses for viral testing, as described below. The children underwent an outpatient follow-up visit between the ages of 12 and 24 months in the Vanderbilt General Clinical Research Center, where infant and maternal blood was obtained and an additional parental questionnaire was completed.",

Phylogenetic analysis was performed with Mega version 4 by using 500 bootstrapped replicates and the neighbor-joining algorithm with HRV87 as the outgroup. 47 Nucleotide identity between strains within each HRV species (A, B, or C) was calculated, and the mean diversity between HRV species was compared with a 2-tailed t test assuming unequal variance.",

Maternal atopy conferred more than twice the risk of more severe HRV-associated respiratory tract illness, as determined by the bronchiolitis severity score, independent of age, race, smoking, and sex. Korppi et al 54 compared infants less than 24 months of age with HRV infection versus RSV-associated wheezing and reported that infants with HRV infection were older and more often had atopic dermatitis and eosinophilia. These data are consistent with our findings that infants with HRV-associated respiratory illnesses are older and that an atopic profile in the mother might be an important risk factor for more severe HRV-associated infant disease. Other cohort studies, such as the Childhood Origins of Asthma study, have elegantly described risk factors for infant virus-associated wheezing and subsequent early childhood wheezing/asthma; however, all infants in those cohorts had 1 or both parents with atopy or asthma and thus constituted a highrisk population. 10, 11, 20 In contrast, our study included infants with no history of maternal atopy as defined by the ISAAC questionnaire; 56% (354/630) of the infants enrolled did not have a history of maternal atopy. Although there are not immediate clinical implications from our study for asthma development, children in this cohort are being followed until the sixth year of life for the outcomes of asthma and allergic rhinitis. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to find that maternal atopy is an independent risk factor for HRV disease severity among term, non-low birth weight infants who are not selected to be at high risk for atopy, suggesting that there is a genetic predisposition to HRV severity and that risk factors for atopy might be linked with risk factors for innate immunity to HRV. Airway epithelial cells from asthmatic subjects have been shown to exhibit aberrant responses to HRV infection in vitro 55, 56 ; our findings suggest that these mechanisms can affect clinical disease.",

The diversity seen among HRVC strains was greater than that seen among HRVA strains, which is consistent with other studies. 1,13 All of the recently described HRVs for which the VP4/VP2 sequences are available fell into the same group, including the QPM strains from Queensland that were originally classified as a subgroup of HRVA. 1, 21, 23, 31, [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] Infants with HRVB infection were more likely to require supplemental oxygen and have a longer duration of hospitalization compared with infants with HRVA or HRVC infection. Consistent with these findings, infants with HRVB infection tended to have higher bronchiolitis severity scores, although the number of HRVB strains was small, as in other studies. 1, 13, 63 HRVC was more commonly seen in black infants compared with HRVA or HRVB. Our prior study also found HRVC infection to be significantly more common in black children less than 5 years of age who were hospitalized with acute respiratory tract illnesses or fever during 1 year and in 1 study site, but this effect was not significant during both study years and in both sites in that investigation. 1 One cannot assume ethnic differences in predisposition to HRVC infection based on these limited data because the effects could have merely been seen based on viral circulation patterns among different geographic or socioeconomic regions, but these findings suggest that both host and viral genetic factors might be important in disease pathogenesis.",

Of the studies that have tested for HRVC infection to date, data on the seasonality of HRVC species are not conclusive. Although many studies have detected HRVC as the predominant HRV species in the fall, suggesting it might play a role in the so-called September asthma epidemic, [21] [22] [23] other studies in different regions and years have found otherwise. Han et al 28 reported HRVC to be more common in the spring and HRVA in the fall in South Korea in 2006, but cocirculation occurred during both seasons. Consistent with our studies, Lau et al 64 found HRVA and HRVC to alternate as the most common HRV species at different times during the peak seasons. Alternate disease activity by species and seasons suggests possible viral interference or serological cross-protection between HRVA and HRVC. 64 Although one study reported HRVC year round without peaks in the spring and fall, 25 most studies do suggest that HRV species vary by season, year, and geographic location. This variation underscores the importance of studies over multiple years and seasons to understand fully the geographic and seasonal HRV epidemiology.",

However, we performed highly sensitive molecular testing for the spectrum of viruses known to cause infant respiratory tract viral illnesses, including influenza, RSV, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza \u00e0The bronchiolitis severity score (BSS) is an ordinal scale that incorporates admission information on respiratory rate, flaring or retractions, room air oxygen saturation, and wheezing in a score ranging from 0 to 12, with 12 being the most severe. 33, 34 virus types 1 to 3, and human coronaviruses, including OC43, 229E, and NL63 (data not shown), with no other virus detected in 73.5% of the HRV-positive children, strongly suggesting that HRV was the causative pathogen. Other studies support these findings. 53, 54 In addition, this study cannot delineate population-based rates of HRV-associated lower respiratory tract illnesses and URIs because the cohort did not equally enroll hospitalized and nonhospitalized infants, with nearly two thirds of the cohort being hospitalized infants, thus overrepresenting infants with bronchiolitis. A final limitation was that we evaluated only 1 geographic site. However, we report a comprehensive study over 4 years in a site that captures more than 90% of Nashville-Davidson county infant hospitalizations.",

Of 455 infants enrolled with bronchiolitis, 18% had HRV infection (9% had HRV infection only without coinfections). Of 175 infants enrolled with URIs, 47% had HRV infection (36% with HRV infection only). Of 104 infants studied with HRV infection only (no coinfections), 39% (n 5 41) had bronchiolitis and 61% (n 5 63) had URIs. Clinical features of infants with HRV and RSV coinfection were similar to those of infants with RSValone, and thus coinfections were excluded from HRV analysis (data not shown). Demographic and clinical differences between infants with HRV infection alone versus infants who did not have HRV infection (other or no study virus detected) are compared in Table II. Infants with HRV infection alone were more likely to be older (20 weeks [IQR, 8-39 weeks] vs 11 weeks [IQR,",

Among patients with HRVC infection, there were racial distribution differences, with a higher proportion of infants who had HRVC infection being black (41% with HRVC vs 0% with HRVB and 26% with HRVA, P 5.019). Maternal atopy was identified in 67% of infants with HRVB infection compared with 46% with HRVA and 45% with HRVC infection (P 5 .47). When comparing HRVA and HRVC, infants with HRVC infection were less likely to attend day care than those with HRVA infection (20% with HRVC vs 38% with HRVA infection, P 5 .048).",
