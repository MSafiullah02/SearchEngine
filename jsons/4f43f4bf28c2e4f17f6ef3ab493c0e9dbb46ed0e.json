Moreover, the culture of human airway smooth muscle has allowed researchers to investigate a pathologic cascade that occurs in asthma as well as other physiologic responses in the smooth muscle of the lung. Numerous lung cancer cell lines have been established to investigate their responses to chemotherapy and determine their biologic properties. Overall, the use of cultured human lung tissue has provided a windfall of information on the pathogenesis of diseases that affect the lung and on the basic physiology and development of the lung in general. Despite this wealth of information in the literature, this chapter is the fi rst to discuss the use of tissue culture models to examine the physiology and pathologic basis of lung diseases. In light of this, we briefl y discuss the history and principles behind the utilization of tissue culture.

            "text": "Primary cell culture involves the isolation of cells from a tissue by disaggregation. Single cell suspensions from tissues can be completed through either enzymatic digestion of extracellular matrix surrounding the cells-such as with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, trypsin, or collagenase-or mechanical disaggregation. These disaggregation procedures have the disadvantage of possibly injuring cells. If the cells of interest are adherent viable cells, they will be separated from nonviable cells when the medium is changed. Alternatively, viable cells can be separated from nonviable cells prior to culture by subjecting the single cell suspension to density gradient centrifugation (e.g., Hypaque). Primary cells have an advantage of possessing many of the biologic properties that they possessed in vivo because they are not transformed. Primary cells, unlike cell lines, are not immortal and have only a fi nite survival time in culture before becoming senescent. Variant cells, however, as well as those obtained from neoplastic tissue, may proliferate infi nitely, thus becoming immortal in vitro. This will eventually allow the immortal cell to take over the culture and can be thought of as a cell line. In general, primary human cultures will survive for 30-80 passages in vitro, although this number is dependent on cell type, conditions, and possibly other unknown factors. Primary cells are widely used to examine the effects of toxins, infectious agents, or other cellular interactions that would not be feasible in vivo. Primary cells have a disadvantage of being a heterogeneous mixture of cells upon primary isolation, with the type of cell obtained generally a component of the disag-gregation method used. The most common contaminant seen following isolation of primary cells is cells of mesenchymal origin (e.g., fi broblasts). However, advances have been made that allow the culture of homogenous populations of cells. For instance, cell surface molecules specifi c for the cells of interest may be tagged with monoclonal antibodies. Techniques such as fl uorescenceactivated cell sorting or the use of magnetic beads can be utilized to enrich the single cell suspension for the cell type of interest. Additionally, some investigators have recently exploited unique characteristics of certain cells, such as the presence of P-glycoprotein or multidrug resistance-associated proteins expressed on endothelial cells, to poison other contaminating cells in culture. 6 Another type of primary cell culture is \"primary explants.\" This type of culture is not subjected to a disaggregation procedure like the primary cell technique described earlier. Therefore, single cell suspensions do not occur. Briefl y, tissue samples are dissected and fi nely minced. These tissue pieces are then placed onto the surface of a tissue culture plate. Following plating of tissue pieces, cells have been shown to migrate out of the tissue and onto the tissue culture surface. 7 This technique is useful when cells of interest may become damaged or lost in the disaggregation technique described earlier and is often used to culture human bronchial epithelial cells. 8 Cell lines are another useful source of cells to investigate questions in biomedical research. These cells have the advantage of being immortal as opposed to the fi nite life spans that primary cells possess. Additionally, they are generally well studied and characterized, leaving few experimental variables to worry about. These cells however, are prone to dedifferentiation-a process by which they lose the phenotypic characteristics of the cell from which they began. Many of the early cell lines were established from tumor tissue and as such possess abnormal growth characteristics. Newer cell lines have been established by molecular techniques such as inserting a telomerase gene into a cell to allow it to replicate infinitely. 9 Because of the phenotypic changes that allow cell lines to replicate infi nitely in culture, they are often a fi rst choice for experiments; however, they are also highly criticized in light of their nonnatural phenotype.",

The main advantage to this type of culture is the retention and preservation of the original cell-cell interaction and extracellular architecture. This type of culture may be particularly important when experimental design necessitates the use of an ex vivo system, but researchers still need to retain the original organ architecture to answer questions posed. These types of cultures do not grow rapidly, however, and are therefore not suitable for experiments needing large numbers of a particular cell type. 10 Advantages and Limitations of Tissue Culture Tissue culture has become the penultimate tool of the reductionist biologist. The utilization of tissue culture as a research methodology has allowed investigators to study isolated interactions in its near-normal environment. These experiments by their very nature introduce artifacts; however, they do minimize the number of confounding variables that may affect a particular experiment. For instance, tissue culture allows investigators to determine the effects of one particular treatment on a particular cell type, which would not be feasible in vivo. Additionally, tissue culture models of disease allow investigators to obtain samples and make observations more readily than those done in vivo. However, it is the relative simplicity of experiments done in vitro that allows models of disease or physiology to come under frequent and warranted criticism. These models do not take into consideration the complexity of biologic systems. Diminishing possible confounding variables by culturing cells in vitro brings up the constant criticism of how applicable results are because of alterations of the normal cellular environment in vivo. For example, cell-cell interactions in vitro are reduced and unnatural. Moreover, the culture does not contain the normal heterogeneity and threedimensional architecture that is seen in vivo. This said, however, tissue culture biology has proved to be successful in many ways.",

Through the use of cell culture, investigators were able to determine individual interactions that occurred in the disease process. Investigators have utilized culture models employing microcapillary endothelial cells under fl ow conditions to understand the role of proinfl ammatory cytokines in the cytokinesis and emigration of neutrophils in disease. Using a model of pulmonary endothelium under fl ow conditions allowed investigators to demonstrate the importance of certain proinfl ammatory cytokines in ARDS. 11 The role of inhaled toxicants in lung injury, and the mechanism(s) by which they cause disease, is another area of investigation that has utilized cell culture. Scientists have developed diverse and unique tissue culture systems that contain air-liquid barriers of lung epithelium and subjected these cells to various gaseous toxicants to determine what occurs following inhalation of various chemicals. Utilizing these types of systems, investigators are able to control the exposure time and other variables that may be diffi cult when determining inhaled toxicant effects in vivo. Moreover, the use of tissue culture, as opposed to an animal model, allows investigators to observe effects kinetically, without undue changes (e.g., sacrifi ce) and expense in the experimental model. 11 A tissue culture model also permits an investigator to observe multiple changes in real time, such as cellular integrity, cell signaling and intracellular traffi cking, protein expression changes, oxidant-induced cellular damage, and more. Deciphering each of these changes in an animal model would be extremely diffi cult; through employing a tissue culture model, researchers are able to tightly control the experimental system while isolating the events of interest. Further examples of how tissue culture models are currently being used to elucidate questions in lung physiology and disease are discussed later in the section on lung tissue cell lines.",

Today, many investigators choose to use molecular biology techniques, exploiting our current knowledge of oncogenic viruses and enzymatic processes of cellular aging to transform primary cells in vitro to an immortal phenotype. It is known that the large T antigen present in the SV (Simian virus) 40 virus is capable of transforming cells to an abnormal phenotype. 11, 13, 14 Moreover, transfection of primary cells with a transposase enzyme has also been shown to induce an immortal phenotypic change while preserving most normal cellular functions and phenotypes. 11 Dedifferentiation A commonly encountered problem in tissue culture is dedifferentiation. This loss of phenotype may be insignificant to the research at hand or it may be critical, and it must be dealt with on a case by case basis.

In vitro exposure systems based on these methods have several advantages. First, in vitro exposure systems can be stringently controlled and reproduced much better than in animal systems; second, individual determination of the cell types' responses to pollutants allows for a better characterization of the individual involvement of the cell type to a biologic response.

The relative ease of growth in culture has led to many cell lines of lung cancer tissue. The National Cancer Institute, recognizing the need for a variety of lung cancer cell lines (both small cell and non-small cell), helped establish over 300 cell lines. 23 These lines are a wonderful resource for investigators given that they are extensively characterized, and many have full clinical data available. Moreover, many of these cell lines are now easily available through the American Type Culture Collection for a modest handling fee. Additionally, if investigators do not wish to use currently established lung cancer cell lines, obtaining clinical samples for use in tissue culture models is relatively easy.

To circumvent this issue, Carrel implemented cultures on silk veils, preventing the plasma clots of the growth media from deforming or becoming spherical, thus facilitating the internal cell's ability to obtain nutrient replenishment. Many attempts were made in standard culture systems (bioreactors) and other culture apparatuses to escape the constraints of two-dimensional cell culture, with the intent of yielding high-fi delity human and mammalian tissues, and thus emphasizing the need for development of three-dimensional biology.",

Leighton's major contribution to three-dimensional culture technology was the introduction of the idea of a sponge matrix as a substrate on which to culture tissues. 36 , 37 Leighton fi rst experimented on cellulose sponges surrounded by plasma clots resident within glass tubes. He devised a system to grow 1-to 5-mm 3 tissue explants on sponges, using small amounts of chick plasma and embryo extract. After the mixture solidifi ed on the sponge Leighton added the nutrient media and inserted the \"histoculture\" in a roller apparatus to facilitate nutrient mass transfer. He experimented with many sponge combinations, discovering that collagen-impregnated cellulose sponges were optimal for sustaining the growth of native tissue architecture. 3, 38 Leighton was successful in growing many different tissue types on the sponge-matrix cultures. 3, 38 Leighton also found that C3HBA mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cells, when grown on sponge-matrix histoculture, aggregated \"much like the original tumor, forming distinct structures within the tumors such as lumina and stromal elements, and glandular structures.\" An extremely important difference of this threedimensional histoculture from the standard two-dimensional culture is the apparent quiescence of the stromal component and the balanced growth of these cells with regard to the overall culture. Leighton further advanced the concept of three-dimensional histoculture to histophysiologic gradient cultures. 39 These cultures are conducted in chambers that allow metabolic exchange between \"the pool of medium and the culture chamber by diffusion across a membrane.\" Histophysiologic gradient cultures mimic, to some degree, diffusion in tissues. 38 From the pioneering work of Carrel and Leighton, other methods of emulating three-dimensional cultures have been developed, such as embedding cells and tissues in collagenous gels of rat tail as per the techniques of Nandi and colleagues. Many of the advantages of threedimensional cultures seen by Leighton, Nandi, and others may be attributed to permitting the cells to retain their normal shape and special associations. 3 This global concept will be important as we begin to understand and recall the physical and environmental characteristics of the rotating-wall vessel systems.",

This technique was popularized by Sutherland and colleagues more than 20 years ago when they manipulated aggregates of cells into a spherical confi guration by spinning agitation of the cells in spinner fl asks. 43 This technique produced pseudo-tissue-like organoids useful for research evaluations. Each of these methodologies will be of benefi t as we continue to examine strategies for achieving three-dimensional lung tissue constructs. 3, 38 Finally, membrane bioreactors are capable of retaining enzymes, organelles, and microbial, animal, and plant cells behind a membrane barrier, trapped in a matrix or adherent to the membrane surface. In 1963, Gallup and Gerhardt 44 fi rst used the membrane bioreactor for dialysis culture of Serratia marcescens. Immobilized enzyme microencapsulation was pioneered by Chang, 45 but Butterworth et al. 46 fi rst developed the enzyme membrane reactor to successfully accomplish starch hydrolysis with \u03b1-amylase. Likewise, for animal cell culturing, Knazek et al. 47 fi rst cultured human choriocarcinoma cells on compacted bundles of Amicon fi bers. Many reviews on the particular applications of hollow fi ber and immobilized bioreactant bioreactors for enzyme catalysts, microbial cells, and animal cell culture are available. [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] As presented previously, tissue-engineering applications of three-dimensional function and structure are well known in medical science research. 54 In microgravity three-dimensional aggregates form, facilitating the expression of differentiated organotypic assemblies. Investigations to determine the effect of composite matrices, spiked with esterifi ed hyaluronic acid and gelatin, to augment osteochondral differentiation of cultured, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells and the effects of the matrix on cellular differentiation have been examined in vitro and in vivo. 54 Briefl y, empty and populated matrices cultured for 28 days, with and without TGF-\u03b2 1 demonstrated the following results. Cells implanted in the matrix produced a robust type II collagen extracellular matrix in vitro. Matrices placed in immunodefi cient mice yielded no differentiation in empty constructs, osteochondral differentiation in loaded implants, and an enhanced level of differentiation in preimplantation in vitro-cultured matrices containing TGF-\u03b2 1 . These results demonstrate the utility of three-dimensional matrix for presentation of bone mesenchymal progenitor cells in vivo for repair of cartilage and bone defects as well as indicate the efficacy for in vitro tissue engineering regimes. 54 These techniques lend themselves to microgravity and ground-based research tissue cultures alike.",

At a concentration of 8 \u00d7 l0 6 stromal cells, mineralization occurs in 6 days. In contrast, twodimensionally oriented marrow fragments at 1 \u00d7 10 7 cells require requires more than 10 days before mineralization can similarly be detected. 55 Two-dimensional long-term marrow culture facilitates and enhances expansion of the stromal component and rudimentary differentiation of osteogenic-like cells in the adherent stromal layer as verifi ed by type I collagen or cells positive for alkaline phosphatase. Production of osteonectin and osteocalcin, a bone-specifi c protein, combined with calcifi cation is observed only in threedimensional cultures.

Investigators have attempted to make a complete study of the most effi cient bioreactor designs and agitation regimens. 59 They concluded that virtually all stirred-tank bioreactors operate in the turbulent regimen. It has been demonstrated that bead-to-bead bridging of cells is enhanced signifi cantly at lower agitation rates in a stirred reactor. 60 Excessive agitation from either stirring or gas bubble sparging has been documented as a cause of cell damage in microcarrier cell cultures. 61, 62 To overcome the problems induced by these mechanisms, investigators developed alternative culture techniques such as porous microcarriers to entrap cells, 63 increased viscosity of culture medium, 64 bubble-free oxygenation, 65 and improved methods for quiescent inoculation. 66, 67 These steps decreased the damage attributed to turbulence and shear forces but failed to signifi cantly rectify the problems. Reactor systems of substantially increased volume exhibit less agitation-related cell damage. This is presumably because of the decreased frequency of cell-microcarrier contact with the agitation devices in the systems. Research-scale investigations do not afford the luxury of experimenting with large-scale production systems. Therefore, if a large-volume system is indeed more quiescent, an improved bioreactor system should emulate the fl uid dynamics present in the upper regions of large-scale reactors in which cells and microcarriers reside with minimal agitation. The problem, then, is to suspend microcarriers and cells without inducing turbulence or shear while providing adequate oxygenation and nutritional replenishment.",

Cells propagated under traditional culture conditions differ widely in their expression of differentiated markers, adhesion receptors, and growth factor receptors compared with cells in situ or those grown as tissue-like structures. 70, 71 This is of concern because the phenotypic changes leading to malignant transformation often stem from alterations in the balanced and multifaceted roles of growth factors, receptors, and cytokines (reviewed by Herlyn et al. 71 ). With increasing evidence of the importance of adhesive contacts, paracrine cross-talk between different cell types, and signaling cascades that link the cell with a complex substratum, there is now recognition that models must be developed that better simulate these complexities. There is still much to learn about the dynamic relationships among the different phenotypes found in the normal lung and in lung cancers. Until a cell culture system is developed that allows differentiation to occur, 72 it is diffi cult to make any fi rm statement about relating effects in cell culture to clinical practice. Tissue engineering is very embryonic in development and currently nearly universally focused on building replacement tissues. A new technology developed at the NASA Johnson Space Center used to study colon cancer has been adapted to three-dimensional in vitro lung tissue culture models but has not been reported on to date.",

Prior to seeding rotating-wall vessels (Synthecon, Inc, Houston, TX), cells were cultured in standard T fl asks (Corning, Corning, NY) in GTSF-2 medium (1993 PSEBM) in a humidifi ed 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 incubator. The rotating-wall vessels were seeded with 1-2 mg/mL Cultispher-GL microcarriers (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT) followed by BEAS2-B or BZR-T33 cells (ATCC, Baltimore, MD) at a density of 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/mL. Cultures were grown in the rotating-wall vessels for 14-21 days for formation of 3-to 5-mm diameter tumor masses. Rotating-wall vessel rotation was initiated at 25 rpm and increased as aggregate size became larger. Stationary control cultures were initiated under the same conditions using FEP Tefl on bags (American Fluoroseal, Columbia, MD). At 24-hour intervals pH, dissolved CO 2 , and dissolved O 2 were determined using a Corning 238 model clinical blood gas analyzer. Glucose concentration was determined using a Beckman 2 model clinical glucose analyzer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA).

Properties such as responses to TGF-\u03b2, drug resistance to cisplatin or cyclophosphamide, and resistance to apoptosis are all altered in various types of cell aggregates. 75 Many investigations sustain consistent evidence that cells growing in three-dimensional arrays appear more resistant to cytotoxic chemoagents than cells in monolayer culture. 38 Li et al. found that spheroids were more resistant to cytosine arabinoside by 11-fold and methotrexate by 125-fold when compared with single cell suspensions. 76 Further monolayer cultures of colon carcinoma cells were sensitive to piericidin C in contrast to responses within in vivo colon tumors or three-dimensional slices of tumors grown in vitro. 77 Numerous other investigations have revealed increased levels of drug resistance of spheroids compared with single cell monolayers. 3, 38 Questions of poor diffusion and insuffi cient drug absorption within spheroids and a relatively frequent high proportion of resting cells have clouded differences in drug resistance, which could be the result of nutrient deprivation and hypoxia. Heppner and colleagues executed precise experiments that confi rmed threedimensional structure and function as the causative agent and was responsible for drug resistance rather than simple inaccessibility to nutrients or the drug concentration. Heppner embedded tumor specimens or cell aggregates in collagen gels, exposed the culture to various cytotoxic drugs, and compared the drug responses of the same cells in monolayers. These experiments revealed an increased resistance in the three-dimensional tumor arrays of a remarkable 1,000-fold greater than in monolayer cultures, and a similar result was seen in three-dimensional histocultures in collagen. The tumor cells grew in the presence of drug concentrations that rendered monolayers to a viability less than 0.1% of control cultures. Amazingly, Heppner observed that the cells became sensitive again when replated as monolayers and fi nally showed that even when exposed to melphalan and 5-fl uorouracil in monolayer cells transferred to collagen gels were again resistant based on three-dimensional architecture. Thus, the cells were exposed to the drugs as monolayers, facilitating access to the drugs, and, once the cells were transferred after drug exposure to a threedimensional structure, high resistance to the drugs was sustained. 38, [78] [79] [80] [81] Based on the caliber of data referenced above, Teicher et al. 82 serially passaged through multiple (10) transfers EMT-6 tumors in mice that were treated with thiotepa, cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide over a prolonged 6month period, thus producing extremely drug-resistant tumors in vivo. When these tumors were grown as monolayer cultures, they were as drug sensitive as the parental cells. Kobayashi and colleagues 83 grew the same in vivo drug-resistant tumor cell lines as spheroids in threedimensional arrays, and resistance was almost 5,000 times that of the parent line with selected drugs, an example being the active form of cyclophosphamide used in vitro. Similarly extreme resistance was also observed to cisplatin and thiotepa. This resistance was not seen in monolayer cultures, even when the monolayers were cultured on traditional extracellular matrix substrates. These experiments reconfi rmed that cells in a three-dimensional array are more drug resistant than monolayer cells in vitro and demonstrated that three-dimensional cellular confi gurations can and do become resistant to super pharmacologic doses of drugs by forming compact structures. 38 Rotating-Wall Vessel Tumor Models Several important human tumor models have been created in rotating-wall vessel cultures, specifi cally, lung, prostate, colon, and ovarian. 14, 58, 73, 84 Many of these models involve cancers that are leading killers in our society. We present two such examples in this section, colon and prostate carcinoma. As previously reviewed, the literature indicates the remarkable difference between chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity in two-dimensional and three-dimensional cellular constructs, which may be predicated on a number of criteria. Therefore, a threedimensional tumor model that emulates differentiated in vivo-like characteristics would provide unique insights into tumor biology.",

Each of these engineered tumor tissues produced tissue-like aggregates (TLAs) with glandular structures, apical and internal glandular microvilli, tight intercellular junctions, desmosomes, cellular polarity, sinusoid development, internalized mucin, and structural organization akin to normal colon crypt development. Necrosis was minimal throughout the tissue masses up to 60 days of culture while achieving >1.0 cm in diameter. Other notable results included enhanced growth of neoplastic colonic epithelium in the presence of mixed normal human colonic mesenchyme.

In particular, the LNCaP and ARCaP models represented in the review are known to be lethal in the human, being androgen independent and metastatic. Rotating-wall vessel TLA engineering also allowed indepth study of epithelial and stromal interactions, which are the facilitating elements of the continuance of LNCaP prostate-specifi c antigen production in vitro. When LNCaP was cultured in three dimensions without stroma, production of prostate-specifi c antigen ceased and metastatic markers were not observed. The authors outline the process of malignant transformation, demonstrating that these metastatic models are only possible in threedimensional TLAs and are achieved by specifi c geometric relationships in three-dimensional confi guration. Furthermore, they show through direct comparison with other culture systems the advantages of the rotating-wall vessel system to allow synergistic relationships to study this disease state. 88 Unlike two-dimensional models, these rotating-wall vessel tumor tissues were devoid of metabolic and nutrient defi ciencies and demonstrated in vivo-like architecture. These data suggest that the rotating-wall vessel affords a new model for investigation and isolation of growth, regulatory, and structural processes within neoplastic and normal tissues.",

Several studies have been conducted recently that indicate that three-dimensional tissues respond to infective agents with greater fi delity and with a more in vivo-like response than traditional two-dimensional cultures. Nickerson et al. 89 describe the development of a threedimensional TLA engineered from INT-407 cells of the human small intestine, which were used as targets for the study of Salmonella typhimurium. In this study, threedimensional TLAs were used to study the attachment, invasion, and infectivity of Salmonella into human intestinal epithelium. Immunocytochemical characterization and scanning and transmission electron microscopic analyses of the three-dimensional TLAs revealed that the TLAs more accurately modeled human in vivo differentiated tissues than did two-dimensional cultures. The level of differentiation in the INT-407 TLAs was analogous to that found in previously discussed small intestine TLAs 72 and from other organ tissues reconstructed in rotatingwall vessels. Analysis of the infectivity studies revealed Salmonella attached and infected in a manner significantly different from that in control two-dimensional cultures. During an identical exposure period of infection with Salmonella, the three-dimensional TLAs displayed a minor loss of structural integrity when compared with the two-dimensional INT-407 cultures. Furthermore, Salmonella demonstrated a greatly reduced ability to adhere, invade, and induce the apoptotic event in these INT-407 three-dimensional TLAs than in twodimensional cultures. This result is not unlike the in vivo human response. Two-dimensional cultures were significantly damaged within several hours of contact with the bacteria; conversely, although \"pot marks\" could be seen on the surfaces of the three-dimensional TLAs, they remained structurally sound.",

Additionally, noninfected three-dimensional TLAs constitutively demonstrated elevated levels of TGF-\u03b2 1 mRNA and prostaglandin E 2 compared with noninfected two-dimensional cultures of INT-407. 89 As previously stated, traditional two-dimensional cell monolayers lack adequate fi delity to emulate the infection dynamics of in vivo microbial adhesion and invasion. The respiratory epithelium is of critical importance in protecting humans from disease. Exposed to the environment, the respiratory epithelium acts as a barrier to invading microbes present in the air, defending the host through a multilayered complex system. 90 The three major layers of the human respiratory epithelium are pseudostratifi ed epithelial cells, a basement membrane, and underlying mesenchymal cells. Ciliated, secretory, and basal epithelial cells are connected by intercellular junctions and anchored to the basement membrane through desmosomal interactions. Together with tight junctions and the mucociliary layer, the basement membrane maintains the polarity of the epithelium and provides a physical barrier between the mesenchymal layer and the airway. 91, 92 Infi ltrating infl ammatory and immune cells move freely between the epithelial and subepithelial compartments.",

Ciliated epithelial cells block invasion of countless inhaled microorganisms by transporting them away from the airways. 93 As regulators of the innate immune response, epithelial cells induce potent immunomodulatory and infl ammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines that recruit phagocytic and infl ammatory cells that remove microbes and enhance protection. 90, 91, 94, 95 Ideally, cell-based models should reproduce the structural organization, multicellular complexity, differentiation state, and function of the human respiratory epithelium. Immortalized human epithelial cell lines, such as BEAS-2B, 96 primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells, 97 and air-liquid interface cultures, 98 are used to study respiratory virus infections in vitro. Traditional monolayer cultures (two-dimensional) of immortalized human bronchoepithelial cells represent homogenous lineages. Although growing cells in monolayers is convenient and proliferation rates are high, such models lack the morphology and cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions characteristic of human respiratory epithelia. Thus, their state of differentiation and intracellular signaling pathways most likely differ from those of epithelial cells in vivo. Primary cell lines of human bronchoepithelial cells provide a differentiated model similar to the structure and function of epithelial cells in vivo; however, this state is short lived in vitro. 97, 99 Air-liquid interface cultures of primary human bronchoepithelial cells (or submerged cultures of human adenoid epithelial cells) are grown on collagen-coated fi lters in wells on top of a permeable fi lter. These cells receive nutrients basolaterally, and their apical side is exposed to humidifi ed air. The result is a culture of well-differentiated heterogeneous (ciliated, secretory, basal) epithelial cells essentially identical to airway epithelium in situ. 98, 100 Although this model shows fi delity to the human respiratory epithelium in structure and function, maintenance of consistent cultures is not only diffi cult and time consuming but also limited to small-scale production and thus limits industrial research capability.",

[104] [105] [106] [107] This process is also infl uenced by the spatial relationships of cells to each other. Each epithelial cell has three membrane surfaces: a free apical surface, a lateral surface that connects neighboring cells, and a basal surface that interacts with mesenchymal cells. 108 Recently viral studies by Goodwin et al. 109 and Suderman et al. 110 were conducted with rotating-well vessel-engineered TLA models of normal human lung. This model is composed of a coculture of in vitro threedimensional human bronchoepithelial TLAs engineered using a rotating-wall vessel to mimic the characteristics of in vivo tissue and to provide a tool to study human respiratory viruses and host-pathogen cell interactions. The TLAs were bioengineered onto collagen-coated cyclodextran beads using primary human mesenchymal bronchial-tracheal cells as the foundation matrix and an adult human bronchial epithelial immortalized cell line (BEAS-2B) as the overlying component. The resulting TLAs share signifi cant characteristics with in vivo human respiratory epithelium, including polarization, tight junctions, desmosomes, and microvilli. The presence of tissuelike differentiation markers, including villin, keratins, and specifi c lung epithelium markers, as well as the production of tissue mucin, further confi rm these TLAs differentiated into tissues functionally similar to in vivo tissues. Increasing virus titers for human respiratory syncytial virus (wtRSVA2) and parainfl uenza virus type 3 (wtPIV3 JS) and the detection of membrane-bound glycoproteins (F and G) over time confi rm productive infections with both viruses. Viral growth kinetics up to day 21 pi with wtRSVA2 and wtPIV3 JS were as follows: wtPIV3 JS replicated more effi ciently than wtRSVA2 in TLAs. Peak replication was on day 7 for wtPIV3 JS (approximately 7 log 10 particle forming units [pfu] per milliliter) and on day 10 for wtRSVA2 (approximately 6 log 10 pfu/mL). Viral proliferation remained high through day 21 when the experiments were terminated. Viral titers for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus were approximately 2 log 10 pfu/mL at 2 day pi.",
