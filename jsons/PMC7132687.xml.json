To assess the comprehensiveness and accessibility of pandemic influenza-dedicated Web sites, a list of US colleges and universities was obtained from the College Navigator function of the National Center for Education Statistics in September 2009. The universities included in this study (1) had a student enrollment of at least 1,000, (2) were classified as 4-year institutions, and (3) provided some form of on-campus housing. A list of 2,768 colleges and universities fitting the inclusion criteria was produced. In an effort to obtain a geographically stratified sample from this list, one university was randomly selected from each US state and the District of Colombia using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). This selection method takes into account the potential for hierarchical spatial spread of influenza outbreaks among states of differing population sizes.14\n",

The survey showed that 92.9% of the 42 sampled universities with influenza-specific Web sites referred directly to the CDC Web site for information. And although not included in this research, the CDC also offers a downloadable \u201cflu widget\u201d used to establish a direct link from any Web site to the CDC influenza-dedicated Web site. The ease of access and reliability of information has made CDC online materials a virtual default resource for universities with pandemic information on their Web sites. However, CDC materials are not institution-specific and cannot replace planning for the unique needs of individual universities, nor do they promote culturally appropriate and community-sensitive approaches. Despite this, only 9.5% of the 42 schools with an influenza-specific Web site referred to more locally appropriate information from either a county or city health department. Because response (including vaccine and medication delivery) is largely local, it is counterproductive to depend primarily on general CDC templates rather than tailoring responses to local circumstances and creating cooperative relationships with local stakeholders. Indeed, with effective cooperation between responding agencies and universities, university influenza Web sites could not only serve the immediate university community, but also provide resources for local preparedness and response messages that are customized to surrounding communities.",

Thus, information specifically addressing parental concerns and university expectations of parents should have a place on the pandemic Web site.

The 2009 novel H1N1 pandemic has been a true test of university public health procedures, which has shown that much remains to be done. The relative ease of use and popularity of online resources, such as CDC influenza Web sites, has made it possible for nearly all universities to provide influenza-specific information somewhere on their Web sites. However, relying primarily or even solely on the CDC online sites for in-depth information on pandemics as many universities do leaves significant gaps in preparation and response capabilities. CDC checklists do not provide the detailed and institution-specific information necessary to field adequate and appropriate responses. University authorities must take into account local public health circumstances and resources, and work toward transparency and specificity in their online communications. Information must be targeted to university audiences and made easily accessible to the entire university community.",
