Among Gram-negative pathogens, resistant P. aeruginosa is the most common cause of nosocomial and healthcare associated infections (HAIs) [2]. Resistant P. aeruginosa is associated with increased mortality and significant costs [3]. The treatment of resistant P. aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen with an ability to rapidly develop resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics, is especially challenging.\n",

Additionally, the long-term effectiveness of antimicrobials is reliant on appropriate and controlled use, and effective antibiotic stewardship, as stipulated in current guidelines [6].

We searched for contemporary articles in this area beginning from 2000 because a previous study that evaluated global publications on this topic identified articles published from mid-to-late 2000 onwards [8]. To ensure completeness of our systematic literature search, we reviewed reference lists of eligible studies and eligible systematic reviews identified from the aforementioned sources. We sought input from an infectious disease clinical expert in the LATAM region with regard to any potentially eligible publications. When eligible, we also considered abstracts from conference proceedings. Separate searches were conducted for each of the objectives. Supplemental Table 1 lists the search strategy terms related to the pathogen (P. aeruginosa), site of infection (urinary tract, intra-abdominal, bloodstream, and pneumonia), initial therapy (inappropriate, appropriate, adequate, or effective), and antibacterial drug therapy. Supplemental Table 2 lists terms related to P. aeruginosa, mode of infection (nosocomial, hospital-acquired, healthcare-acquired, hospital-associated, healthcare-associated), and risk factor assessment (risk factors, predict, risk score, risk assessment, and multivariate analysis) and was limited to the LATAM region (Latin America and Caribbean countries). Articles published in Spanish and Portuguese languages, the most common languages from the LATAM region were translated by one of the authors (EEA).",

First, AIAT compared with IIAT was associated with a halving of 30-day mortality (unadjusted summary OR = 0.48). This significance persisted in subgroup analyses, when appropriate antibiotics were initiated within 48 h, in blood stream infections, and among patients admitted to the hospital wards. Although there were no studies to draw conclusions for < 24-h or 24--to-48-h time points, this review demonstrates that a 48-h time point is a possible threshold beyond which a significantly higher mortality risk is observed with further delays in AIAT.",

For example, resistance to the carbapenem class, an important class of initial therapy in severe nosocomial infections, is now reported to be more than 70% in some hospitals in the LATAM region [32]. Indeed, a number of individual studies exist in the public domain examining risk factors associated with resistant P. aeruginosa infections in LATAM. Notably, prior use of antibiotics (11 studies), stay in the ICU (3 studies), and comorbidity score (3 studies) were significant predictors of acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa.",

For example, P. aeruginosa has evolved virulence characteristics that may make it a difficult target for antibiotic therapy. Resistant strains of P. aeruginosa are the most frequent source of HAIs and are often associated with overuse or inappropriate use of antimicrobials. Our review highlights that there was a consistent association between prior use of antimicrobials and acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa. Our findings concur with many other studies that showed exposure to previous antimicrobial therapy prior to the development of current infection can lead an increased risk of resistance to different classes of antibiotics [34]. A thorough understanding of risk factors associated with acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa can aid in the monitoring of resistant pathogens in order to prevent emergence of MDR/XDR/pan-drug resistant pathogens. More importantly, knowledge about these risk factors can help tailor presumptively better antimicrobials to be used.",

To the best of our knowledge, there was no previously published systematic review and meta-analysis from the LATAM region comparing AIAT with IIAT and systematically reviewed studies from the LATAM region evaluating multivariate risk factors predicting acquisition of P. aeruginosa. This review included studies published in English, Spanish and Portuguese languages from the LATAM region. Additionally, this review comprehensively searched for studies indexed in regional databases. The overall results from this review are consistent with other systematic reviews published literature from other regions that compare the role of AIAT with IIAT in mortality [8, 35, 36]. Nonetheless, in light of a few limitations, the results of the systematic review and meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution. There was a general lack of studies reporting adjusted analyses for mortality outcomes. Therefore, our meta-analysis is restricted to unadjusted results comparing AIAT with IIAT that did not account for potential confounders. Overall, risk of bias among individual studies was high and there was inconsistencies across studies. The majority of studies were retrospective observational studies. This translated into a low overall strength of evidence that was confirmed by a formal evaluation of the GRADE to assess the overall strength of evidence. The impact of AIAT versus IIAT on treatment response, length of stay, and costs in the LATAM region is unknown because there were no studies evaluating these outcomes. In addition, studies either did not clearly define AIAT and IIAT, or lacked consistent definitions on timeliness and susceptibility to antimicrobial therapy.",

AIAT against a possible infection has been a challenge owing, in part, to different resistance trends in several regions of the world. In addition to implementation of infection control programs in hospitals, a thorough understanding of local epidemiology and better laboratory facilities are essential in targeting appropriate antibiotic. Given the high resistance rates in the LATAM region and the worse outcomes associated with P. aeruginosa infections, there is a continued need for the use of appropriate antimicrobial agents with activity against P. aeruginosa. The consistent role of prior use of antibiotics or a stay in ICU in the acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa reinforces the importance of antimicrobial stewardship programs, especially in the ICU setting among critically ill patients.",
