Specific imaging characteristics for different pathogens were thoroughly described and now represent the first step in the management and follow-up of those patients. Structural cross-sectional techniques, however, reach their limits when questions of molecular nature are asked, such as differentiating active infection from sterile inflammation and/or immune response or from other etiologies such as primary or metastatic malignancies (Figure 8.1). Molecular imaging, on the other hand, has the potential of transcending the limitations of structural imaging, providing molecular and cellular level information. Multiple examples of preclinical central nervous system (CNS) imaging applications in the setting of viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal infections can be found in the literature. Clinical and human translational applications however remain limited in number and in scope.\n",

While only a few studies have attempted targeting the unmodified pathogen directly, tracking genetically modified pathogens in animal models, generally using optical imaging, remains the main approach. There are also multiple studies describing host responses to infection such as activation of microglia or other components of the immune system. Among those approaches, direct targeting of the pathogen is probably of most clinical significance and would be most interesting to translate.",

Another limitation inherent to the CNS is the presence of the blood\u2013brain barrier limiting brain access to few molecules with special characteristics (e.g., small size, appropriate lipophilicity). Even though the BBB can be disrupted in infectious processes, this is not always the case. In fact, with indolent less aggressive pathogens, the BBB can remain intact or minimally breached. In theory, directly imaging the infectious agent can be performed using ligands incorporated only by the pathogen but not by eukaryotic cells or through targeting of pathogen enzymes with labeled substrates. One example of the latter approach is imaging herpetic ( HSV-1) encephalitis using 18F-FHPG, a fluorinated derivative of ganciclovir, which is selectively phosphorylated by the HSV thymidine kinase (Tk) enzyme and subsequently trapped within infected cells [1]. Selective uptake of the ligand is then visualized using PET imaging of rats that received intranasal injection of HSV-1 compared to sham animals. This approach however is limited to pathogens that possess the Tk enzyme, but more importantly by the inability of Tk substrates such as FHPG, FHBG, and FIAU to cross an intact BBB . Even when the BBB is disrupted, the substrate can \u201cleak\u201d resulting in nonspecific accumulation. A well-designed experiment by Buursma et al. used a freezing injury model causing sterile disruption of the BBB ; even though 18F-FHPG accumulated initially, it washed out quickly suggesting that the FHPG uptake in actual infections is due to irreversible trapping of the ligand in phosphorylated form within the infected cells [1].",

Sorbitol is not taken by eukaryotic cells and was found to be readily incorporated in Gram-negative but not Gram-positive bacterial cells [2]. 18F-FDS was previously synthesized through chemical reduction of the widely available ligand, 18F-2-fluoro-deoxy-d-glucose (18F-FDG) [3]. Even though originally designed to image brain tumors [3], a significantly higher uptake of 18F-FDS was seen in the E. coli-infected brain versus brain tumor or normal brain, suggesting specific uptake and retention by the bacteria (Figure 8.2) [2]. This is rendered even more sensitive by the demonstrated lack of background uptake in the normal brain. Even though FDS can only detect infections due to the Enterobacteriaceae family, it can be greatly used in the right clinical setting, providing localization of the infection, differentiation of active infection from host inflammatory reaction, and evaluation of response to treatment. Development of pathogen-specific ligands with wider detection range and low background uptake is the ultimate goal.\n",

A common approach is the use of recombinant viruses engineered to express a luciferase enzyme\nwhich allows performing longitudinal imaging, accurately determining the site(s) of infection, describing the temporal systemic dissemination of the virus, and eventually quantifying viral titers in various organs. A major limitation however is the inherent potential for attenuation of viral replication and/or loss of virulence of the pathogen [4\u20138]. Both latter factors thus need to be carefully evaluated prior to starting imaging experiments. Early examples included developing recombinant viruses that expressed various luciferase reporter proteins\nsuch as HSV-1 [6], vaccinia virus [9], and the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the Coronavirus family [10]. An interesting finding in the paper by Raaben et al. is the detection of the protective role of type I interferon in MHV infection , with widespread viral dissemination, elucidated through bioluminescence, seen in mice lacking a functional type I interferon\nresponse and reversal of the process through the administration of type I interferons to the mice [10]. This is an example of molecular imaging providing insight into potential therapeutic applications. More recent examples include the use of recombinant murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) expressing the firefly luciferase (Fluc) to monitor virus progression after CNS infection [11] and of recombinant , for real-time evaluation of replication kinetics in the brain of infected mice [12]. Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV; Alphavirus)\n, a mosquito-borne virus that can cause severe encephalitis in humans, was also evaluated in a recombinant form (expressing Fluc) in intranasally infected mice [13].",

Similarly, the use of luciferase-expressing Trypanosoma brucei brucei\nallowed the identification of pathogen entry into the brain (using multi-photon microscopy) in early stages and determination of their responsiveness to various drugs (bioluminescent parasites were permanently eliminated by treatment with melarsoprol and DB829 but not with diminazene).

Instead, by using serial noninvasive bioluminescence imaging, they reduced the time needed to assess drug efficacy by two-thirds [17].",

The classical ligand for TSPO has always been 11C-PK11195; however a multitude of newer (second-generation) ligands designed to overcome the limitations of PK11195 have been developed over the last couple of decades [21]. Using two of the second-generation ligands, 11C-DPA-713 and 18F-DPA-714, along with the prototype ligand 11C-PK11195 [22], neuroinflammation in the setting of HSV encephalitis could be imaged, with 11C-DPA713 showing the lowest nonspecific uptake, suggesting it may be the most suitable for visualizing mild inflammation. Other pathogens in which neuroinflammation was visualized using TSPO ligands include simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in macaques [21] and Taenia solium (neurocysticercosis) in patients [23]. In the latter study, perilesional edema surrounding calcified lesions was visualized using 11C-PBR28 suggesting resurgence of inflammation despite the chronicity of the infectious process.",

            "text": "Major limitations of TSPO imaging however exist. The main limitation is its inability to specifically visualize infection with ligand accumulation readily seen with sterile inflammation such as that induced by injection of quinolinic acid in the rat striatum [24] (Figure. 8.3). Another main limitation in human translation of TSPO imaging is a recently described polymorphism (rs6971) located in exon 4 of the TSPO gene which results in nonconservative amino acid substitution at position 147 from alanine to threonine ( Ala147Thr) in the fifth transmembrane domain of the TSPO protein [25]. This polymorphism results in three binding levels: high, medium, and low binding. To account for the variability, in most cases, genotyping of subjects prior to quantitative assessments of TSPO upregulation using PET is necessary. Another problem with TSPO imaging in non-focal brain infections such as neuro-HIV is the lack of a reference region due to diffuse involvement of the brain. Analysis of the data in such cases requires labor-intensive arterial blood sampling and analysis of metabolites. Recent description of TSPO ligands that are not sensitive to polymorphism is encouraging [26]. Other currently evaluated neuroinflammation imaging targets include the cannabinoid receptors\nCB1 and CB2 which together constitute the endocannabinoid system [27]. Multiple ligands targeting CB2 are being developed [28\u201330] with encouraging animal applications [29]. Targeting leukocytes and platelets changes associated with different infectious processes has also been attempted. One example is the use of single-chain antibodies that recognize the ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS) of GPIIb/IIIa in activated platelets [31]. GPIIb/IIIa\nbecomes exposed upon activation and therefore offers the opportunity to target activated platelets [32]. By conjugating the LIBS antibody to iron oxide nanoparticles, they used it in an animal model of cerebral malaria and were able to detect abnormal vascular platelet aggregation in vivo. This approach allowed imaging of the infection before pathology could be visualized by conventional in vivo MRI [31].\n",

Up till now a handful of studies have used this technology in the evaluation of infectious processes; however the available literature points toward a big role for this technique in better understanding the role of specific immune cells such as CD+ lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the pathophysiology of CNS infection. The potential applications are limitless. For example, in the brains of mice chronically infected with , two-photon microscopy showed that antigen (Ag)-specific CD8 T cells were recruited and persisted in the presence of ongoing Ag recognition. The dynamics of the interactions between T cells and the parasite could then be visualized real time: while CD8 T cells made transient contacts with granuloma-like structures containing parasites and with individual CD11b+ APCs, including some that did not contain parasites, they ignored intact Ag-bearing cysts, astrocytes, and neurons, including infected neurons [33]. In another example, two-photon imaging\nwas used in mice infected with different strains of malaria, showing that CD8+ T cells tended to accumulate mainly in the perivascular spaces of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) mice\n. This however was also seen with strains that did not cause ECM, indicating that the presence of perivascular T cells per se is insufficient to cause ECM [34]. What differentiated the strains however were dynamic time-lapse movies that showed distinct differences in T-cell motility rather than localization, with the arrest of T cells in the perivascular spaces correlating with the pathogenic potential [34]. This dynamic real-time demonstration of host\u2013pathogen (immune system) interactions within living tissue will surely facilitate and improve our understanding of immune responses to persistent pathogens in the brain.",
