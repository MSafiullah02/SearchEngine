Molecular biological techniques are permitting a rapid and accurate diagnosis of infections caused by respiratory pathogens, and have typically been applied to upper respiratory samples. Sputum induction provides an opportunity to directly sample secretions from the lower respiratory tract. Objectives/study design: To determine the role of induced sputum reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the detection of respiratory pathogens and compare this with detection using serology and immunofluorescent antigen (IFA) testing, we recruited 49 adults from emergency room with exacerbations of asthma. After a medical assessment and spirometry, sputum was induced using ultrasonically nebulised normal saline. Sputum was assayed using IFA and RT-PCR for flu and RSV. Flu serology was performed acutely and at convalescence, 4 \u00c1/5 weeks later. Results: Influenza A or B was detected in 24% of the samples by PCR, significantly more than the nine cases detected using serology and the one case using IFA (P B/0.05). RSV was detected in 37% of samples using PCR and 20% by IFA (P B/0.05). Conclusion: The combination of induced sputum and RT-PCR provides a useful means of detecting respiratory infection. The technique is safe in both adults and children, and RT-PCR is more sensitive than conventional serology and IFA. The improved sensitivity of induced sputum RT-PCR also permits a more rapid diagnosis and the opportunity of early administration of effective treatments. #", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Viral respiratory tract infections are the main cause of asthma exacerbations in both community (Nicholson et al., 1993; Johnston et al., 1995) and hospital settings (Wark et al., 2002; Teichtahl et al., 1997) . The most common viruses isolated are rhinovirus, influenza (Flu) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Nicholson et al., 1993; Johnston et al., 1995; Wark et al., 2002; Teichtahl et al., 1997) .

Similarly, lower respiratory tract samples were more sensitive than nasal wash/throat swab for RSV diagnosis (Englund et al., 1996) . A key factor in obtaining a good diagnostic success rate is sample quality, with samples containing higher cell numbers having a significantly better influenza detection rate than samples with low cellularity (Noyola et al., 2000) . Sputum induction improves the quality and reproducibility of samples. An immediate limitation when applying these results to people with asthma is the ability to obtain adequate sputum from the majority of subjects.

Sputum can be induced using hypertonic saline inhalation, and induced sputum has an established role in the diagnosis of respiratory infection due to tuberculosis and Pneumocystis carinii (PCP).
