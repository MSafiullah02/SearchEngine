Most colleagues opted to not delay start of treatment in patients with stage III NSCLC or with limited stage SCLC. Also, the consensus was to not delay palliative treatment in NSCLC patients, but instead to use hypofractionated courses. Moreover, experts favored to recommend standard-of-care concomitant radiochemotherapy instead of giving sequential chemo-radiotherapy, or targeted agents or immunotherapy instead of chemotherapy.",

During the pandemic, we have learned that the overall mortality from COVID-19 may be rather low, depending on the healthcare resources. As we have also learned in recent weeks, most persons infected with COVID-19 will have mild or asymptomatic disease and recover completely. Of course, a dominant issues is the protection of other patients and healthcare workers. However, for the individual patient with a highly life-threatening cancer, we are dealing with the possible undermining of a potentially curative treatment when postponing or interrupting treatment. Our societies may need to coexist with the virus for a while and asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases are expected to appear frequently in our cancer clinics in the coming months. While the recommendations might need to be revisited as the 4 setting changes, they may be a prototype for future pandemics and the basis for a unified response.",

In our eyes, it would be unethical to restrict curative cancer treatment to COVID-19 negative cohorts. As far as 1) In asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients, radio(chemo)therapy may be continued as planned, in case all precautious measures for the care givers are in place to avoid exposure. In practice, those patients may be, e.g., treated as last patients of the shift or on a dedicated linear accelerator.",
