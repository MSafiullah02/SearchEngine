If real-time counters are used, such as laser photometers (up to 10 \u03bcm), condensation particle counters (up to a few micrometers), or size-resolved particle spectrometers (up to several tens of micrometers), temporal concentration profile can be recorded. Measurement is commonly taken at a reference location and the concentration is considered as representative of the entire indoor microenvironment. This approach completely ignores the influence of human-generated thermal plume effects on concentration profile, which has been reported to be an important factor affecting indoor concentration [6], [7]. Apart from this conventional sampling method, advancement of optical technology had led to more affordable and reliable instruments to measure particle concentration non-invasively. Recently, there have been some works that have used in situ imaging technique for collecting data of exhaled aerosol dispersion [7], [8].",

A real-time particle counter was used to measure concentration at the mouth under steady and episodic events and interactions of movements of exhaled/inhaled air with the droplets were carefully studied.",

In the breathing circuit, a common path was used for inhalation and exhalation (Fig. 2, Path C). Although the tubing was kept short, finite time was still required for the filtered air to purge the entire tubing. Thus a certain fraction of particles were retained inside the tube, leading to non-zero concentration during exhalation. Higher breathing rates led to higher purging rates in tubing and hence, fewer particles were retained inside the tube; concentration level dropped further. Comparison of Fig. 4, Fig. 5 shows that the higher the breathing rate, the better the results match with the ideal breathing pattern. Table 1 also confirms that the BNB ratio is inversely proportional to pulmonary ventilation. They may be regarded as a limitation for estimation the dose during breathing. In spite of this constraint, it is believed that it did not affect results of episodic emission shown below.",

This can be attributed to the dynamic behavior of motorized valves as it takes finite time for them to open and close mechanically. More experiments to measure the dynamic properties of valves are required to confirm the hypothesis. Inferring from the results shown in Fig. 4, the inhalation period of 2.5 s and the exhalation period of 1.5 s were assumed hereafter.

Fig. 6(a) shows a single peak profile and the concentration starts to decline when the inhalation cycle begins.

Detailed comparison of Fig. 12, Fig. 13 reveals that the maximum to minimum ratio increases with pulmonary ventilation, i.e. 2.9\u20136.4 times for 7 LPM to 23 LPM, respectively, for the MV scheme, and 1.6\u20131.9 times for the DIS scheme. The variation of ratio under the MV scheme is larger than the DIS scheme. Under the MV scheme (Fig. 12), high-velocity, high-turbulence supply air disturbs the aerosol-laden jet from the expiratory source. Nevertheless, this would not be the case in the DIS scheme, where low-velocity airflow is not expected to disturb the aerosol-laden jet.

The ratio is inversely proportional to the pulmonary rate, regardless of the ventilation mode and emission velocity. This is attributed to the influence of the exhalation process. Under light physical activities where pulmonary ventilation equals 23 LPM, exhalation process plays a significant role in reducing the inhalation level. It overwhelms the enhanced inhalation in the process. The higher the breathing rate, the sharper the resultant drop of concentration would be, leading to lower the dose. However, it is possible that dose would be increased under very low and low pulmonary ventilation, where some results show BNB ratios higher than 100%. This may be attributed to the effect of dose reduction is smaller for very low and low pulmonary ventilation and, therefore, the reduction of dose caused by the exhalation process was not high enough, compared to the enhancement of the dose during inhalation. Besides, the BNB ratio under the MV scheme is lower than that of the DIS scheme under the same emission velocity and pulmonary ventilation.",
