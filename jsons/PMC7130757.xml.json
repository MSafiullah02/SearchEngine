They cover a great deal of ground \u2013 from atmospheric CO2 removal all the way to the carbon footprint of sandwiches; from the bioeconomy to flaring, CCS to ball milling!",

So the editors hope that you will find in these pages issues on which you can take action to mitigate the drastic and dramatic consequences of our wholly unsustainable global activity \u2013 in energy use, resource extraction and processing, habitat destruction \u2013 which pose a real threat to the survival of civilisation on this planet. This must be the objective of our Institution's flagship \u2018sustainable development\u2019 which was championed by the UN in the Brundtland Report. So tackling climate change is not about simply doing the things we already do more efficiently, or meeting some concept of economic growth based on current measurement criteria: it requires a fundamental shift in approach, and we have to succeed in implementing dramatic change within a 30-year time horizon. This has been eloquently put by Myles Allen (the physicist behind \u2018net zero\u2019), in a radio 4 interview with Jim Al-Khalili (BBC)",

Currently, global production and consumption levels are overshooting the planet's biocapacity by about 50% each year (Sustainable Development). In other words we have already grown beyond ecological limits, and growth is no longer an option on a global scale. This ecological overshoot is due almost entirely to overconsumption in rich countries (Giljum et al., 2014). SDG 8 calls for improving \u2018global resource efficiency\u2019 and \u2018decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation\u2019. However, global material extraction and consumption has doubled over the past 30 years (National Footprint Accounts, 2016), and has accelerated since 2000. Within my lifetime the world's population has trebled, and so has resource consumption per head. So a policy of \u2018sustainable production\u2019 is by itself simply unsustainable.",

According to climate scientists, the world must halve its emissions by 2030 to stand any chance of avoiding disastrous climate breakdown. Yet there are indications of an acceleration in warming \u2013 partly as a result of the albedo effect: the reduction in the surface reflectivity as a result of shrinkage of snow cover in the Arctic; and partly as a result of thawing of the Arctic tundra, leading to the evolution of vast quantities of methane gas. If we add to these the calving of huge icesheets from the Thwaites glacier and the Antarctic continent, then the rise in sea level \u2013 affecting and displacing possibly as much as 40% of the (growing) global population \u2013 appears inevitable and indeed imminent.",
