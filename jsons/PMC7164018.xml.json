Their wide range of essential functions in combination with their presence in such a wide distribution of organisms illustrates the importance of the family, and has led many research groups to assess their utility as therapeutic targets for both infectious and chronic diseases of humans. The result of this is an enormous field of study assessing the function, structure, and inhibition of M1 aminopeptidases in a range of organisms, each of which is often portrayed as a novel therapeutic target. In this review, we aim to examine this field and address the formidable question: do M1 aminopeptidases really constitute an entire family of therapeutic drug targets? We cannot attempt to summarize this field in a single review, nor is that our intention. Rather, we have focused on recent research articles, and where applicable, made reference to other more comprehensive reviews. Specifically, we have examined the potential of M1 aminopeptidases as therapeutic drug targets by assessing (1) whether the characterized enzyme plays a validated role in the health and disease of humans, and (2) if their activity can be modulated to affect a human disease state.1 The M1 aminopeptidases that we have discussed in the text are summarized in Table 1. We hope that this review stimulates further evaluation and discussion of the field, and addresses how those of us within the field can best utilize the available resources to progress toward the ultimate goal of developing novel therapeutics to treat human disease.",

This observation was further supported by a chemical genetics approach that showed that the absence of M1 aminopeptidase activity resulted in parasite death 28. Agents that inhibit PfA\u2010M1 activity in parasites have been shown to control both laboratory (P. falciparum) 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 and murine (P. c. chabaudi) models of malaria 33, 34. Bestatin is an effective inhibitor of PfA\u2010M1 and derivatives have been developed as chemical probes to investigate the biological role and substrate specificity of the aminopeptidase, although it should be noted that many of these inhibitors are not only selective for PfA\u2010M1 but also act on a second, unrelated essential zinc\u2010dependent aminopeptidase, PfA\u2010M17 (clan MF, family M17) 28, 30.

More recent studies have strategically developed dual inhibitors to target both PfA\u2010M1 and PfA\u2010M17 in an approach designed to reduce the risk of the rapid development of drug resistance. The most effective of these inhibitors combines a hydroxamic acid zinc\u2010binding group linked to fluoro\u2010substituted bi\u2010aryl system (10o, Fig. 2B), which occupies the S1 subsite, and short aliphatic moieties, to probe the S1\u2032 subsite (Fig. 3) 29, 32.

In Anopheles gambiae, AnAPN is present on the apical surface of the midgut of the mosquito as a membrane bound dimer and is required for parasite infection 41. Therefore, should a mosquito feed on a vaccinated human, antibodies specific for AnAPN1 would block infection of the mosquito. AnAPN1 is an immunogenic antigen that induces potent, long\u2010lasting, strain\u2010 and species\u2010transcending, transmission\u2010blocking antibodies that function independently of aminopeptidase activity 42. Interestingly, when the epitopes of transmission\u2010blocking monoclonal antibodies are mapped onto the structure of AnAPN1, they are localized to the surface of domain I on the inner wall of the proposed dimer 43.

The pathway involves a cascade of proteolytic steps to process peptidic hormones, each of which possess unique functions. Two M1 aminopeptidases are involved in this pathway; aminopeptidase A (APA) catalyses the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin III, which is then processed to angiotensin IV by APN 46. Angiotensin III has been identified as exerting the greatest effect on central blood pressure in animal models 46. Therefore, while both enzymes have been implicated in the central regulation of blood pressure, only the inhibition of APA has been validated as a strategy to treat hypertension. Prior to the availability of a crystal structure, a homology model of APA was designed and used to dock inhibitors into the active site 47. When the crystal structure was subsequently determined, it showed good agreement with the model 9. APA activity requires a Ca+2 at the base of the S1 subsite in addition to the conserved Zn+2 characteristic of this enzyme class. Lead compound EC33 (Fig. 2C, K\ni for APA = 0.29 \u03bcm) engaged both metal ions, was selective for APA over APN, and inhibited brain APA in a dose\u2010dependent manner 48, 49. Further, the orally active prodrug form of EC33, RB150, reduced blood pressure in hypertensive rats models, and did not affect blood pressure in normotensive animals 50, 51. EC33 is small, and contains a thiol predicted to interact with the catalytic Zn+2 (Fig. 2C). While selectivity over APN has been determined, to our knowledge, no studies assessing its binding to other human zinc\u2010dependent proteases have been conducted. Given EC33 is a relatively weak APA inhibitor, the presence of additional physiological effectors cannot be ruled out. Promisingly, a single dose of RB150 is well tolerated in humans, and has progressed through Phase Ib clinical trials, and is therefore suitable for further longer term studies in hypertensive patients 51, 52.",

It was the subject of such early scrutiny due to its unique characterization as a bifunctional enzyme with two distinct catalytic functions: epoxide hydrolase activity to convert LTA4 into leukotriene B4 (LTB4) 54 and aminopeptidase activity to degrade and inactivate the tripeptide Pro\u2010Gly\u2010Pro (PGP) 55. Perhaps even more curious, is that these two catalytic functions operate on opposing sides of the inflammatory response. LTB4 and PGP both attract neutrophils and promote inflammation, therefore while the epoxide hydrolase activity of LTA4H has a proinflammatory effect, the aminopeptidase activity of LTA4H has an anti\u2010inflammatory effect 56, and only inhibition of the hydrolase activity would be desired for an anti\u2010inflammatory therapeutic. Prior to identification of PGP as a physiological substrate, LTA4H was targeted for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as acute lung injury, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. The identification of PGP as the physiological substrate for LTA4H has since precipitated the structural characterization of the two distinct catalytic roles. Despite the necessity of the catalytic zinc ion for both catalytic mechanisms, the two sites are distinct (Fig. 4), and the inhibitor ARM1 (Fig. 2D) is capable of selective inhibition of the epoxide hydrolase activity 56. This study provides the first convincing evidence that LTA4H could be a useful therapeutic target.",

Early structure\u2010based substrate profiling studies demonstrated LTA4H shows a preference for tripeptides with a P1 arginine that binds within a distinct specificity pocket 57. The identification of PGP as the physiological substrate is therefore surprising and suggests there are important physiological substrates for the LTA4H aminopeptidase activity that we do not yet understand. As we continue to uncover these unknown functions, we are likely to further illuminate other phenomena not previously understood. For example, a 2016 study recently implicated LTA4H as the potential target of a topical anti\u2010inflammatory agent, Bufexamac (Fig. 2E), which was previously attributed to targeting cyclooxygenase, although with limited direct evidence 58. Xiao et al. characterized the inhibition of the LTA4H epoxide hydrolase activity by bufexamac, and determined the cocrystal structure. This structure showed bufexamac bound in the PGP site by coordination of the catalytic Zn+2. Therefore, we can infer that bufexamac inhibits both the aminopeptidase and hydrolase activity of LTA4H. Interestingly, side effects of Bufexamac include allergic contact dermatitis 59, which could be explained by the inhibition of PGP breakdown. This has led to recommendations in Europe to remove it from the market. Despite this, Xiao et al. went on to show that bufexamac inhibits LTB4 biosynthsis in neutrophils, thus inhibiting chemotaxis, and alleviated lipopolysaccharide\u2010induced acute lung injury, a neutrophilic inflammation\u2010associated disease, in mouse models 58. While this is promising, the potential side effects caused by interfering with PGP breakdown need to be given serious consideration in future LTA4H inhibition studies.",

APN is most commonly observed as a membrane\u2010anchored dimer 3, 7, although a monomeric form in serum has also been described 60. Overexpression of APN has been observed on leukemic blasts in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 61, and compelling studies have implicated APN protease activity in tumor\u2010associated processes, particularly angiogenesis and metastasis 62, 63. The aminopeptidase activity of APN has therefore been intensively studied as a target for AML and a wide range of tumor types 64, 65, 66, 67, 68. The most widely studied competitive APN inhibitors, Ubenimex (Bestatin) and Tosedostat (formerly CHR\u20102797), have been clinically investigated for their anticancer effects: Ubenimex is approved for treatment of lung cancer, AML, and nasopharyngeal cancer, and Tosedostat showed significant antileukemic activity in Phase I/II clinical trials 65. Currently Phase I/II studies of Tosedostat in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for AML and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma are ongoing. Furthermore, Su et al. 69, showed that increasing a compounds APN inhibitory activity improved the antimetastasis and antiangiogenesis effects in vivo, thereby providing evidence that their anticancer effect is a direct result of inhibition of APN peptidase activity.",

Therefore, selectivity is a particular concern for its use as a therapeutic. The recent determination of the X\u2010ray crystal structure of bestatin in complex with APN showed that bestatin binds with a noncanonical pose, coordinating the zinc with its terminal carboxylic acid (Fig. 5) 7. This is curious, given that all other bestatin\u2010bound aminopeptidase structures, including the closely related porcine APN (80% sequence identity), show a binding mode wherein the backbone hydroxy ketone of bestatin coordinates the active site zinc ion (Fig. 5). Irrespective of whether this unusual binding pose is observed in solution, it shows that human APN has the capacity to bind ligands differently to other M1 aminopeptidases, and suggests that careful structure\u2010guided drug discovery methods could exploit the differences in M1 aminopeptidase active sites to design selective APN inhibitors. A second potential solution to the selectivity issues of bestatin is presented by in vitro studies conducted by Saiki et al., who demonstrated that an APN\u2010specific monoclonal antibody WM15 inhibits invasion of highly metastatic cancer cells into recombinant basement membrane in a dose\u2010dependent manner 63. Subsequent studies showed that WM15 inhibits tumor\u2010derived APN activity and degradation of type\u2010IV collagen, suggesting that APN may also be involved in extracellular matrix degradation 63.",

Broadly, their role is to process antigens for loading onto the major histocompatibility complex and subsequent recognition by the appropriate T\u2010cell. Much of our understanding of the role of these enzymes is derived from comparative genome studies showing polymorphisms in the three enzymes are associated with immune\u2010mediated diseases, as well as mouse models and in vitro knockdown (see reviews 71, 72). Polymorphisms of ERAP1/ERAP2/IRAP undoubtedly result in disease; however, proposed therapeutic uses of inhibitors are not targeted to these loss\u2010of\u2010function phenotypes, but rather toward autoimmune diseases and manipulation of the body's own immune response to combat disease (for a review of the proposed uses of ERAP1/ERAP2/IRAP as therapeutic targets see 72). Compounds that coordinate the catalytic zinc ion of ERAP1/ERAP2/IRAP with a phosphinic acid and occupy the substrate pockets via peptide\u2010like moieties (e.g., DG013A, Fig. 2F) potently inhibit all three enzymes, and alter antigen processing and presentation to enhance the cytotoxic response in murine cancer cell lines 70. While promising, complete inhibition of all three enzymes can be expected to result in side effects analogous to loss\u2010of\u2010function phenotypes. The strategy to target one or more of ERAP1/ERAP2/IRAP therefore requires careful validation, and a greater understanding of the specific physiological roles of each of the enzymes. Examination of their function and assessment of their potential as therapeutic targets is greatly complicated by the current choices of animal models; while mouse models have often been used, there are major differences in the antigen\u2010processing pathway between mice and humans, including a complete lack of ERAP2 in mice (discussed by Ref. 73).",

Research led by Stratikos recognizes this, and is spearheading the design of selective inhibitors for all three enzymes guided by a combination of crystallography and docking studies 77, 78. Although they have successfully developed submicromolar inhibitors, the use of IC50 values rather than inhibition constants (K\ni) to measure compound inhibitory activity means that it is difficult to determine whether true selectivity has been achieved. Most recently, Weglarz\u2010Tomczak et al. have used a collection of previously designed, generic M1 aminopeptidase inhibitors to generate selective, submicromolar inhibitors of ERAP2 79. However, ERAP1 could not be selectively inhibited over ERAP2, and the compounds have not been tested for IRAP inhibition.",

Those that have been implicated in a disease state have been studied in greater detail, which has illustrated the complexity of the physiological networks and roles for a single human M1 aminopeptidase. Despite this, inhibitors of both APA and APN have already shown promise in the clinic for treatment of hypertension and cancer\u2010type diseases, respectively. In the remaining cases, particularly LTA4H, ERAP1, ERAP2, and IRAP, carefully designed chemical probes need to be used as tools to further investigate the precise physiological roles for the enzymes in vivo before a single enzyme can be validated as a therapeutic target. During this validation process, close attention needs to be paid to ensure that the inhibitors are specific for the targeted enzyme over the other M1 aminopeptidases, and that suitable animal models are chosen. Many of the developed inhibitors have been based on substrate analogs or small zinc\u2010binding compounds. This design strategy raises substantial concerns regarding selectivity, as the M1 aminopeptidases all possess conserved active site zinc\u2010binding and catalytic exopeptidase motifs, and are therefore likely to be inhibited by similar molecules. As a result, much of the available information describing the role of an M1 aminopeptidase and its potential as a therapeutic target is derived from nonspecific inhibitors. Inhibitor specificity remains a problem even for those M1 aminopeptidases that have been validated as drug targets. Off\u2010target side effects caused by lack of selectivity for a specific enzyme may not be identified until long\u2010term treatment during clinical trials.
