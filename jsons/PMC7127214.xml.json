            "text": "In viruses that utilize programmed \u22121 frameshifting, the open reading frame (ORF) encoding the major viral structural protein (typically the Gag protein) is located at the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA, whereas the ORFs encoding proteins with enzymatic functions (typically Pro and Pol) are located at the 3\u2032 end of the transcript and out of frame with the Gag ORF (Fig. 1\n). The enzymatic proteins are only translated as a result of a programmed ribosomal frameshift event, which occurs with an efficiency of 1\u201340%, depending on the specific virus and assay system employed[3]. Thus, the majority of translational events result in the production of the Gag protein, while only a minority yield viral enzymatic proteins (Fig. 1\n). The efficiency with which the frameshift occurs therefore determines the ratio of structural to enzymatic proteins available for virus-particle assembly (Fig. 2). This gene arrangement is important for virus-particle morphogenesis, because viruses require a large excess of structural components over the proteins with enzymatic activities. The importance of maintaining the appropriate ratio of these factors has been demonstrated using two endogenous viruses of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results demonstrate that altering the efficiency of programmed ribosomal frameshifting in either the \u22121 or +1 direction changes the ratio of Gag to Gag\u2013Pol proteins synthesized, and thus the virus-particle assembly and RNA packaging, resulting in reduced viral titres6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15(Fig. 2). In addition, it has been shown that gross changes in the ratio of Gag to Gag\u2013Pol proteins in retroviruses like HIV or Moloney Murine Leukaemia Virus interferes with virus-particle formation16, 17. These studies suggest that programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting presents a novel target for antiviral therapies.",

            "text": "The cis\u2212acting sequences that promote efficient \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting have been well characterized in several viral systems2, 3, 4, 5. Two basic sequence elements are required to promote efficient levels of programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting. The first sequence element is called the `slippery site' and consists of a heptamer sequence X XXY YYZ [the incoming 0-frame (e.g. the gag reading frame) is indicated by the positioning of the spaces], where XXX can be any three identical nucleotides, YYY can be AAA or UUU, and Z is A, U or C (Fig. 3\n)10, 18, 19, 20. The second promoting element is usually a sequence that forms a defined RNA secondary structure, such as an RNA pseudoknot, approximately six nucleotides 3\u2032 of the slippery site and is thought to increase the probability that the ribosome will slip reading frame in the \u22121 direction (Fig. 3)21, 22. The simultaneous slippage of both ribosome-bound tRNAs by one base in the 5\u2032 direction still leaves their non-wobble bases correctly paired with the mRNA in the new reading frame (Fig. 3). Thus, the number of ribosomes that shift frame is affected by a number of parameters, including the ability of the ribosome-bound tRNAs to unpair from the 0-frame, the ability of these tRNAs to rebind to the \u22121 frame, the relative position of the RNA pseudoknot from the slippery site and the pseudoknot's thermodynamic stability10, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.",

            "text": "The fact that programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting appears to be virus specific makes it an attractive target to identify agents that affect the efficiency of this process and, consequently, of virus maintenance. We can envisage three major advantages to programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting as a therapeutic target for antiviral agents.1.Small changes in frameshifting efficiencies can have large effects on virus production; for example, increasing or decreasing the efficiency of programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting by the yeast L-A virus by as little as a factor of two interfered with the ability of yeast cells to maintain the M1 `killer' satellite virus of L-A6, 19.2.Compounds that change the efficiency of programmed ribosomal frameshifting function at concentrations that do not drastically inhibit the translational machinery (see below). Thus, these compounds should function as therapeutic agents at low drug concentrations, minimizing potential toxicity to the host. As described in greater detail below, it has been demonstrated that the peptidyl-transferase inhibitors anisomycin and sparsomycin efficiently inhibit viral propagation of the yeast killer virus at concentrations below those that inhibit cell growth and protein synthesis[6].3.The fact that this strategy targets a host-cellular process rather than a viral gene minimizes the ability of viruses to evolve drug-resistant mutants (Fig. 4\n). Most conventional antiviral strategies target a virus-specific protein\u2014for example, nucleoside analogues and protease inhibitors, the most commonly used classes of antiviral agents, both target gene products encoded by the viral pathogen (Fig. 4). However, this therapeutic strategy generates a selective pressure for mutations in the viral genes that causes resistance to the actions of these drugs; drug-resistant mutants will therefore arise and, because virus populations evolve on the time scale of weeks to months, drug resistance emerges rapidly.\n",

Second, viral variants that might overcome the effects of the drugs by changing the efficiency of programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting back to wild-type levels would theoretically have to involve multiple mutations in the slippery site and/or in the RNA pseudoknot according to the rules governing this process10, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 29, making it more difficult for drug-resistant mutants to arise. Thus, by shifting the selective pressure away from the virus' evolutionary strength, targeting programmed ribosomal frameshifting minimizes the ability of viruses to evolve drug-resistant mutants (Fig. 4b), and so agents that affect ribosomal frameshifting without deleteriously inhibiting the host-cellular translation apparatus would be excellent candidates for antiviral therapies.",

The first strategy (Fig. 5a) has been used by many laboratories6, 19, 22, 30, 32, and is typically used to directly measure in vivo or in vitro programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies and relies on the use of two different enzymatic reporter constructs that are assayed in parallel. The transcription-initiation and -termination signals, and the reporter gene in the two constructs are the same in both plasmids. The differences lie in the fact that the 0-frame control plasmid contains the reporter gene in the same reading frame as the translation start site with no intervening viral sequence, resulting in high-level expression of the reporter protein. The \u22121 frameshift reporter construct contains a virus-derived programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift signal inserted between the start codon and the reporter gene, in such a way that the reporter gene is in the \u22121 frame with respect to the translational start site. Thus, the reporter protein can only be translated if the ribosome shifts frame in the \u22121 direction. The efficiency of \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting is calculated by determining the ratio of reporter-protein activities measured in cells or cell extracts harbouring the \u22121 frameshift reporters to those harbouring the 0-frame controls. Because the efficiency of programmed ribosomal frameshifting is based on the ratio of frameshift-reporter to 0-frame-control activities, the efficiencies of programmed ribosomal frameshifting are always normalized to the effects that drugs have on overall translation by monitoring the reporter-protein activities of the 0-frame controls in the presence of the indicated drug. The changes in programmed frameshifting are determined by calculating the ratio of frameshifting efficiency in the presence of the drugs to that in cells grown in the absence of any drug.",

Agents that inactivate the NMD pathway would stabilize these mRNAs, resulting in higher expression of the frameshift-reporter protein, appearing to increase the efficiency of programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting. Thus, a second, independent assay system is required to confirm that the agent affects programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting and that it has antiviral activity. The killer-viral system of the yeast S. cerevisiae has served as a model for investigations into the mechanisms governing \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting[2]. Typically, it is composed of the L-A helper virus and the M1 satellite virus. The dsRNA genome of L-A contains two ORFs, the 5\u2032 gag gene encoding the major viral coat protein (Gag) and the 3\u2032 pol gene encoding a multifunctional protein that includes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a domain required for viral RNA packaging. A \u22121 ribosomal frameshift event is responsible for the production of the L-A encoded Gag\u2013Pol fusion protein[19](Fig. 6\na). The M1 satellite dsRNA virus of L-A encodes a secreted `killer' toxin and its dsRNA genome is encapsidated and replicated inside the icosahedral 39-nm L-A viral particle. Changes in the efficiency of programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting along the L-A mRNA result in rapid loss of M1, which can be monitored by replica-plating colonies of test cells on a lawn of cells that are sensitive to the killer toxin; cells maintaining the M1 virus secrete the killer toxin, creating a ring of growth inhibition[10](Fig. 6c).",

It was shown that oligonucleotides that bound immediately 3\u2032 of the HIV frameshift signal increased the efficiency of programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting sixfold. Further investigations suggested that increasing RNA secondary structure downstream of the frameshift site increases the programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting efficiencies[34]. Taken together, these results demonstrate that specific agents can be used to modulate the translation machinery, without inactivating translation, in order to alter the efficiency of programmed frameshifting to such a degree as to promote loss of the killer virus.",

Altering the frameshifting efficiencies disrupts the virus' life cycle, eliminating or reducing virus production. Programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting should be an excellent target for compounds that function as antiviral agents, because it is predominantly utilized by these viruses to regulate gene expression. Small changes in ribosomal frameshift efficiencies can be achieved at sublethal concentrations of the chosen compounds, so that subtle modulations of the host-cellular translation machinery results in alteration of frameshifting efficiencies and virus loss. Importantly, because the correct efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting is determined in part by the host-cellular translational apparatus, and owing to the complex nature of the programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift signal, compensatory viral mutations will not be easily generated, greatly reducing the likelihood of drug-resistant variants.",

Pictured are the 0-frame control reporter and \u22121 ribosomal frameshift constructs. Both systems utilize a reporter protein (the lacZ-encoded \u03b2-galactosidase, in vivo, or luciferase, in vitro). In the \u22121 ribosomal frameshift construct, the reporter is cloned downstream of programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift signals and is in the \u22121 frame with a translational start site. Synthesis of the reporter protein thus requires a programmed ribosomal frameshift event. The 0-frame controls have the reporter genes cloned in frame with the start site and lack the intervening viral frameshift signals. The programmed ribosomal frameshift efficiency is determined by dividing the level of reporter-protein activity produced from the \u22121 reporters by that produced from the 0-frame control and multiplying by 100%. Translation of the reporters can occur in intact yeast cells or in translationally competent cell extracts. The effects of a candidate compound on both overall translation and on programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting can be monitored. (b) General strategy for assays in intact yeast cells that detect changes in programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies by using a selectable marker. A gene encoding a selectable marker is cloned downstream of, and in the \u22121 frame with respect to, a translational start site, such that synthesis of the gene product requires a programmed ribosomal frameshift event. Changes in programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies are detected by monitoring the ability of cells to grow (positive selection) or not (negative selection) in the presence of a candidate compound. (c) Bicistronic constructs for measuring changes in programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting efficiencies. Reporter-gene 1 constitutes the 0-frame control and can be used to monitor the effect of a compound on overall translation. Translation of reporter-gene 2 requires a programmed ribosomal frameshift event. Changes in programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies are detected by monitoring for changes in the ratios between the activities of the two reporter proteins.",
