Whereas a biomedical perspective assumes a clear link of that kind, a psychobiological perspective does not. The latter perspective is open to the possibility of psychological factors (e.g., cognitions, emotions and everyday behaviors) playing an intervening role in the adverse response to the exposure. A psychobiological perspective does not in principle exclude any type of exposure, and can indeed account for the impact of, for example, bacteria, dust, fungi and their secondary metabolites. Rather than having a toxic effect, the levels at which the exposures typically are present in NBRS and CI are more likely to evoke one or several of the body's defense mechanisms described in the article (Nordin, 2020). Hence, chemical and biological compounds as well as psychological and social exposures may act as stressors if interpreted by the body/mind as potentially hazardous, and evoke a defense that we refer to as symptoms. In this context, chemical/biological compounds and psychological/social exposures may interact and thus intensify the response.",

In fact, all described mechanisms in the article (Nordin, 2020) are biological and psychological in nature. From my biopsychosocial perspective, it is not meaningful to separate biological and psychological processes in health and disease since they constantly interact and guide each other \u2013 a perspective that has been around for close to half a century (Engel, 1977). Tuuminen et al. (2002) mention the work of Martin Pall. According to his model on oxidative stress, short-term stressors may increase nitric oxide levels and initiate illness such as CI, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and posttraumatic stress disorder. These stressors, due to the nitric oxide product, peroxynitrite, initiate a complex vicious cycle mechanism that is responsible for chronic illness (Pall, 2007). This is a good example of yet another psychobiological mechanism of relevance for NBRS and CI, since oxidative stress can interact with various types of stressors, including mental stressors (M\u00fcnzel and Daiber, 2017). The reason for not including the model of oxidative stress in my review article (Nordin, 2020) is that there still is limited empirical support for it regarding NBRS and CI. However, hopefully, studies will be conducted to carefully test this interesting model in these intolerances.",

Acting as a stressor, these exposures evoke protective responses that we refer to as adverse symptoms. This will take place irrespective of whether the exposure reaches toxic levels or not. Tuuminen et al. (2002) state in their letter to the editor that \u201cOccupants become ill in water-damaged houses infested with toxin producing microbes\u201d. Although it is well documented that water-damaged houses infested with microbes constitute a risk factor for NBRS (Mendell et al., 2011), one should be careful in claiming that is due to an underlying toxic mechanism. Everything around us is potentially toxic (including microbes), but, importantly, it is a matter of dose. Claiming that a certain exposure is toxic just because its substance can have a toxic impact at a high dose is meaningless unless it is demonstrated that the dose at hand is actually toxic. In a similar vein, Tuuminen et al. (2002) oppose a statement in which I claim that there is no scientific support for electromagnetic fields from everyday electrical devices having an impact on health, and that there instead is support for expectations (nocebo) underlying symptoms attributed to these exposures (Rubin et al., 2010). Again, it is a matter of dose. Without doubt, long-term exposure to high level of electromagnetic fields is hazardous. However, persons who attribute symptoms to everyday electrical devices are not typically exposed to such doses.",

Empirical and theoretical support for these mechanisms is provided in the article (Nordin, 2020).",

Declaring the exposure as toxic if such a dose is not reached is, in fact, highly irresponsible since the worries it will trigger may initiate a nocebo effect, which, in turn may initiate neurogenic inflammation, sensitization, etc (Nordin, 2020). Nevertheless, if there is good reason to suspect that the exposure dose is sufficiently high to cause a toxic effect, the techniques proposed by Tuuminen et al. (2020) for assessing exposure level of potential toxins and toxic impact may well be applied. I am thankful to Tuuminen et al. (2020) for their update on conditions in which the level of indoor microbes, such as Stachybotrys, emit substances as liquid vesicles with concentrations of potential toxicity. In such conditions, a careful toxic investigation can be motivated.",

Thus, psychobiological processes underlie these conditions. Notably, it is my personal experience that persons with NBRS and CI commonly report that their problems started when being in a condition of distress, and that their problems terminated or decreased considerably when being relieved of distress. Although various stress-related conditions of mental ill-health (e.g., burnout, anxiety and depression) have been shown to be risk factors for NBRS and CI (e.g., Palmquist, 2017), it is important to point out that NBRS and CI are not mental disorders or cases of pathologic personality. It is also important to differentiate risk factors from causes. The defense mechanisms described in my article (Nordin, 2020), that we all have access to, are not more of a sign of mental disorder than are cases of the common cold or allergy. Rather, when being in distress our defense mechanisms are more prone to become activated. The associations between distress and NBRS/CI may well be bidirectional due to the adverse impact these intolerances can have on quality of life (S\u00f6derholm et al., 2011, 2016), and may well result in a negative spiral.",

In severe cases of NBRS and CI in which the intolerance has generalized to various odorous and pungent substances, the avoidance will have considerable impact on the ability to participate in society (S\u00f6derholm et al., 2011, 2016). However, this dilemma for the individual with severe NBRS/CI is more complex than so. Whereas avoidance may have the positive short-term effect of no symptoms being evoked, it may in severe cases contribute to permanent the adverse reactions to the exposure, and possibly generalize to other exposures. Persons with mild NBRS/CI may recover spontaneously if the exposure is removed, for example at work, at home or at school. However, the situation is different for the patient with severe NBRS/CI. Assuming that the exposure evoking the symptoms does not reach a level of toxicity, total avoidance may, in fact, strengthen the exposure\u2013symptom association; a strengthened non-exposure\u2013non-symptom association will also strengthen an exposure\u2013symptom association. However, as a starting point, it is important to eliminate the biological or chemical substances that evoke the symptoms. Thus, exposure to these substances that the afflicted person cannot control him-/herself will continue to evoke symptoms. This includes not only anaphylactic reactions, but all types of adverse reactions. If the afflicted individual with severe NBRS/CI will have a chance to recover from the intolerance in the long-term, the person must re-learn the exposure\u2013symptom association to an exposure\u2013non-symptom association (\u201cre-wire\u201d these neural networks), preferably with professional help. A parallel to this is immunotherapy in allergy (Jutel et al., 2015).",

It is released as an end product of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis. In chronic stress, hypothalamic activation of the pituitary gland changes from corticotropin-releasing hormone-dominant to arginine vasopressin-\u200bdominant, and cortisol levels remain raised due at least in part to decreased cortisol metabolism. Hence, chronic exposure to stress results in long-term cortisol exposure becoming maladaptive, which is known to lead to a broad range of health problems (Russell and Lightman, 2019).
