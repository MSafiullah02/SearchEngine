However, it was estimated that there would be over 3 billion passenger journeys within as well as in and out of China between Jan 10 and Feb 18, around the Spring Festival (CGTN, 2020) [10] . As of Jan 23, 2020, Chinese government initiated an unprecedented public health intervention to confine the epidemic by shutting down all transportation in and out of Wuhan (i.e. a modern form of quarantine) [11] . It was estimated that the number of newly confirmed cases would reach its peak at 8 (6-10) days after the lockdown initiation and that the quarantining might last for two weeks [12] . However, the real-world evidence for the impact of such interventions has not been thoroughly examined. The outbound travel restriction still remains effective in Wuhan when this article is written (Mar 28, 2020).",

However, our study revealed considerable differences in the timing and magnitude of COVID-19 epidemics between Huangshi and Wuhan cities. The basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of COVID-19 was estimated to be as high as 3.11-6.49 [12, 14] . It turned out that the rapidity of the growth of cases in Wuhan was much greater than that observed in outbreaks of either SARS or MERS-CoV [15, 16] . The lockdown intervention resulted in the limited outbreak in Huangshi, as well as containment of the export of cases. Some mathematical models suggested that the lockdown strategy applied early may significantly reduce disease transmission by up to 70% [12] .",

Yet, how this novel coronavirus arrived in Wuhan remains unclear. The primary reservoirs for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats while the intermediary sources were civet cats and camels respectively [17] . The genomic sequencing results showed that 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, but more distant from SARS-CoV (79%) and MERS-CoV (50%) [18] . In addition, the epidemiological association between 66% (27/41) of the initial infected patients with Huanan wet market [4] , suggests that the novel coronavirus may be related to sale of wild animal as game food. Consistent with previous reports, we found laboratory- It is worth noting that COVID-19 was characterized by mild cases (uncomplicated illness plus mild pneumonia) in Huangshi, accounting for 82.66% of total confirmed cases, higher than previous reports on cases in Wuhan [6] . In addition, 50 asymptomatic infections were identified through screening. This might be explained by both a decreased virulence throughout the successive transmission, like SARS-CoV [19] , and under-reporting bias in early cases in Wuhan. Undetected asymptomatic or mild cases may also be a factor in the apparent decrease in the case fatality rate over time. If asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic but infectious cases constituted an important fraction of the total infection, R 0 might be higher than estimated because detecting and isolating these cases would be \"extremely challenging\" [20, 21] .",
