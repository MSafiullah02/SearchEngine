The aim was to explore how country attributes and circumstances affect SME assessments of the likelihood, impacts, and rankings of global risks, and to find out if SME risk assessment and rankings differ from the global rankings. Data were gathered using an online survey of manufacturing SMEs in Turkey. The results show that global economic risks and geopolitical risks are of major concern for SMEs, and environmental risks are at the bottom of their ranking. Among the economic risks, fiscal crises in key economies and high structural unemployment or underemployment were found to be the highest risks for the SMEs. Failure of regional or global governance, failure of national governance, and interstate conflict with regional consequences were found to be among the top geopolitical risks for the SMEs. The SMEs considered the risk of largescale cyber-attacks and massive incident of data fraud/theft to be relatively higher than other global technological risks. Profound social instability and failure of urban planning were among the top societal risks for the SMEs. Although the global environmental and disaster risks were ranked lowest on the list, man-made environmental damage and disasters and major natural hazard-induced disasters were ranked the highest among this group of risks. Overall, the results show that SMEs at a country level, for example Turkey, perceive global risks differently than the major global players.",

While they can better control much of the internal risks through risk management and treatment measures, they are more vulnerable to external risks because these risks are often beyond their control, influence, radar, and capacity to manage. The World Economic Forum (WEF) has created, assessed, and monitored 30 global risks since 2005, using a survey of about 1000 major global stakeholders and players. By the WEF definition, a global risk is ''an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, can cause significant negative impact for several countries or industries within the next 10 years'' (World Economic Forum 2019, p. 100).",

At least 90% of the firms in both developed and developing countries are SMEs (Mbuyisa and Leonard 2017) . They account for 40-60% of GDP in developed and developing countries (Igwe et al. 2018 ) and generate about 40% of the global industrial production and 35% of the world's exports (Sharma and Bhagwat 2006; Mbuyisa and Leonard 2017) . Small and medium enterprises are the backbone of the European economy, with more than 99.8% of all non-financial businesses, 58% of total value added, and 66.8% of total employment (Briozzo and Cardone-Riportella 2012; European Commission 2015) . In Japan, more than 99.7% of all firms are SMEs, they employ more than 70% of the workforce, and create more than 50% of all added value of the manufacturing industry (Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary 2018) . Small and medium enterprises comprised 99.8% of the firms in Turkey in 2014 and were involved in 55.1% of export and 37.7% of import (Kaya and Uzay 2017) . Considering their size and roles in the national and global economies and the fact that the enhancement of the private sector's resilience depends on risk reduction by SMEs (Chatterjee et al. 2015) , more studies are needed to better understand various aspects of SME risk management.",

Small and medium enterprises around the world, particularly in developing and emerging economies do not have strong risk management, business continuity, and crisis management cultures and systems in place (Asgary et al. 2013; Yuwen et al. 2016; Kaya and Uzay 2017) . Most of SMEs not have the resources and expertise to focus on these activities and therefore are more vulnerable to internal and external risks and disruptive shocks (Leopoulos et al. 2006; Marks and Thomalla 2017) . To minimize the impacts, it is important that SMEs become more aware of global risks, as well as assess, monitor, and enhance their risk management and business continuity management capacities (G\u00fcne\u015f and Teker 2010; Brustbauer 2016; Kaya and Uzay 2017) .",

Asset bubbles in a major economy can increase the production costs through inflation, wage increases and labor shortages, and access to financial resources that will impact the global economy (Zheng et al. 2010) . Global financial crises cause substantial downturn in the formation of new SMEs, their performance, and their existence in the market. The 1997-1998 world financial and economic crisis severely impacted SMEs. As interest rates started to rise, many SMEs were bankrupted due to the credit crunch, tight monetary policies, and decline in domestic and international demands (Filardo 2011; Wehinger 2014) . The number of bankrupted SMEs in South Korea, for example, particularly in the manufacturing sector, increased by nearly 100% from 1996 to 1998 (Gregory et al. 2002) . The 2008 economic crisis induced severe socioeconomic impacts worldwide and impacted SMEs in almost every economy, far beyond expectations, through fast domino effects that caused massive SME closures, downsizing, and reduced the number of new ventures (Chowdhury 2011; Sannajust 2014). Small and medium enterprises were under extreme pressures and experienced devastating decrease in demand and revenues, increased lay-offs, and stressful working environments (Kossyva et al. 2014 ). Close to 50% of the SMEs in Belgium and the Netherlands, for example, experienced extended delays in their receivables (Kossyva et al. 2014) . Small and medium enterprises in the United States lost 2.8 million jobs (Gagliardi et al. 2013) . During this global turmoil, Turkish SMEs were also impacted heavily (Karadag 2016) .",

High structural unemployment lowers demand for goods and services and impacts SMEs significantly (Alegre and Chiva 2013) . Illicit trade reduces SME competitiveness in the global market. In countries with higher levels of economic risk, SMEs have less of a chance to flourish (Mekinc et al. 2013) . Energy is an important input for SME production and logistics. If energy prices are not manageable or controlable, SMEs face major uncertainties about energy costs and availability (Mulhall and Bryson 2014) . Energy price shocks raise SME production costs (Kilian 2008 ) and compromise their individual and collective competitiveness in the global economy. It is mainly because SMEs are usually less flexible with respect to their energy sources and SMEs in the manufacturing sector are very energy intensive, that unpredicted fluctuations in energy prices impact them extensively. Energy price shock events have become more frequent and a consistent feature of the energy markets in recent years (Mulhall and Bryson 2014) . As the global demand for energy increases, more shock events in the energy prices are expected. Finally, unmanageable high inflation rates at national and global levels pose risks to SMEs through higher interest rates (Cefis and Marsili 2006; G\u00fcl et al. 2010 ).",

            "text": "Small and medium enterprises around the globe, particularly those that are part of the global supply chains, are exposed to various types of global environmental and disaster risks that can have devastating impacts on SMEs (Auzzir et al. 2018 ). These enterprises are highly vulnerable to and not well prepared for most of the global environmental and disaster risks (Crichton 2006; Schaefer et al. 2011) . They are vulnerable to environmental disaster risks on four fronts: capital, labor, logistics, and markets (Ballesteros and Sonny 2015) . Environmental and disaster risk events can damage and disrupt the supply chain networks in which many SMEs are embedded. They can also damage SME assets, premises, and inventories, disrupt their operations, increase their production costs, and reduce their revenues and long-term growth potentials (Snyder and Shen 2006; Griffiths 2010, 2012; Asgary et al. 2012) . Small and medium enterprises have limited capabilities to recover from these events and bring their operations, revenue, and profit back to pre-event conditions (Asgary et al. 2013) . Considering the links that exist between climate change and extreme events, it is expected that these events will increase in the future (IPCC 2013). Small and medium enterprises face significant climate change-related environmental and regulatory risks (Schaefer et al. 2011) . Major costly floods, severe heat and cold waves, heavy rains and extreme storms with higher frequency and intensity are observed globally. Extreme events not only cause disruptions and destruction to SMEs, but also create major challenges for their continuity of operations and future planning (Gunawansa and Kua 2014; Gasbarro et al. 2018 Studies show that overall about 25% of SMEs do not reopen following a major disaster (Ballesteros and Sonny 2015) . Of the US companies that experience disasters, for example, 43% never reopen, and another 29% close within 2 years (Weinhofer and Busch 2013; Ballesteros and Sonny 2015) . Small and medium enterprises are worse off after disaster events compared to before disaster because they are relatively resource constrained, less resilient, are mainly informal and some of them do not fully comply or are not requested to follow standards and codes, lack necessary insurance, do not carry out risk assessments, and are often without business continuity plans (Ye and Abe 2012; UNDP 2013; Ballesteros and Sonny 2015; Halkos et al. 2018) .",

Many of these risks are cross border with global consequences. While existing international political and economic agreements such as those of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are weakened by unilateralism, there is little evidence that new and better multilateralism agreements are replacing them (Pascual-Ramsay 2015; Asgary and Ozdemir 2019). Rather these agreements are being replaced by fragmentation, bilateralism, regionalism, as well as local and short-term interests (Pascual-Ramsay 2015; Asgary and Ozdemir 2019). The international economy and its key players, including SMEs, are becoming more exposed and vulnerable to existing and emerging geopolitical risks and uncertainties (Pascual-Ramsay 2015) . Studies show that terrorist attacks, for example, even though they are very small in terms of direct physical impact zones, have economic impacts that are often substantial and very extensive. Repeated terrorist attacks in one country not only impact the economy of that country but create spillover impacts for neighboring countries and the global economy. Terrorist attacks discourage foreign investments and capital inflows and cause significant loss of economic activities and international trade (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2008; Araz-Takay et al. 2009 ). These risks can also increase insurance, transaction, transportation, and security costs for SMEs.",

            "text": "Global societal risks have specific implications for SMEs. Failure of urban planning leads to declining cities, informal urban growth or sprawl, and poor and fragile infrastructure with significant social, environmental, and health issues (Asgary and Ozdemir 2019). Such urban environments are not able to adequately support enterpreneurship activities that can compete at national and global levels. Cities without efficient and interconnected transportation systems, with significant air pollution, and unaffordable land and housing prices are not attractive for entrepreneurship growth (TURSAB and TUADER 2017). But SME engagement in risk management and critical infrastructure protection is an effective way to reduce the impact of future disasters in urban areas (Chatterjee et al. 2015; Chatterjee et al. 2016) . Food and water crises are other important global risks that can affect SMEs in several ways, particularly those in the agri-food business and those that are in water-intensive manufacturing sectors. Social instability as another global risk is not healthy for SME growth and competitiveness. Global pandemics such as the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic can have immediate direct and indirect impacts on SMEs. For example, SARS had major impacts on SMEs, particularly those in the tourism and hospitality sector in heavily impacted countries such as China, Canada, Thailand, and Hong Kong (Kuo et al. 2008) . Studies have found that many SMEs do not recognize pandemics as a meaningful risk. Although governments have tried to raise awareness and provide resources to enhance pandemic preparedness by SMEs, awareness or concern and actual preparedness have not changed much, and most SMEs do not have appropriate preparedness and continuity plans for future pandemics (Watkins et al. 2008) . Armed conflicts, interstate wars, natural hazards and disasters, and climate change are creating widespread involuntary and forced displacement around the globe. Population displacements have a range of economic, social, and political impacts on both source and host countries (Tumen 2016; Salgado-G\u00e1lvez 2018) . The impacts of forced migration on SMEs have not been studied yet, but it may have both positive and negative impacts. At least SMEs can be considered a solution for some of these problems by providing job opportunities for displaced people. Turkey has received more than 4 million displaced people from Syria since the start of conflict in 2012 (Onur 2018).",

New technologies such as robotics, autonomous vehicles and drones, automation, smart phones, artificial intelligence, 3-D printing, cloud computing and big data, and new materials are among the new technologies that can have unintended consequences and risks for manufacturing SMEs. These technologies have the potential to reduce outsourcing. Studies predict that 47% of the jobs in the United States (much of them in SMEs) are at high risk of being automated over the next 20 years, especially in manufacturing, logistics, and administrative support (Pascual-Ramsay 2015). These advances will possibly reduce employment opportunities for workers in manufacturing SMEs and will challenge SMEs survival.",

Like other institutions, SMEs are dependent on internet and information technology and a substantial number of their sales and orders are handled through cyberspace and networks. Any major failure and disruption of the national and global information infrastructure and networks due to large-scale disaster events can have significant negative impacts on SMEs. Such disruptions can have severe consequences for SMEs that are very vulnerable and without adequate protection. Small and medium enterprises use these technologies in production and service delivery, distribution, sales, and marketing. Data breaches, cyber security, and intentional or accidental technological failures can disrupt or significantly damage the short-and long-term operation as well as the existence of SMEs.",

This will allow us to compare the results of the study with the global risk report results. Qualitative risk assessment is one of the most widely used risk assessment approaches because of its low cost and ease of use and it is quick to perform (Modarres 2006) . In QRA, potential likelihoods and consequences are assessed using qualitative scales such as low, medium, and high. Qualitative risk assessment uses subjective likelihood and consequence values collected from experts and decision makers and, as such, they are not always perfect estimates and are subject to biases and heuristics (Talbot 2011) . Assessed likelihoods and consequences for selected risks are then ploted in a two-dimensional space to generate a risk matrix. Various risk matrix forms and sizes have been reported in risk assessment reports. A risk matrix is used to visualize, compare, and rank different risks based on their locations in the matrix. Color coding is mostly used to show the importance of each risk. The risk matrix approach is also used for indicating possible risk control measures and to record the inherent, current, and target levels of risk (Hopkin 2012) .",

Small and medium enterprises are very vulnerable to economic and financial crises as they are forced to close, downsize, and reduce the number of new ventures due to sharp decrease in demand and revenues (Ates et al. 2013; Sannajust 2014; Wehinger 2014) . In today's global economy, Turkish SMEs are not exempt from this, and they have been frequently impacted by such risks in the past two decades as well (Karadag 2016) . Moreover, giving high likelihood and high impact values for financial crises and other economic risks can be explained by the fact that Turkish economy has deficit in international trade (Abbasoglu et al. 2019 ) and highly rely on external energy sources such as oil and natural gas.",

This is possibly due to the increasing dependency of the SMEs to the internet and the increasing number of cyber attacks and data theft in recent years (Mbuyisa and Leonard 2017) . While SMEs do not consider the impacts of these risks as high as their likelihoods, still these risks can cause disruptions and severe consequences to them, particularly because they are not well equipped to manage these risks. A recent report published by Allianz (2019) confirms that SMEs in Turkey increasingly recognize their cyber vulnerability and risks. Finally, the relatively lower perceived likelihoods and impacts of the global risks by the sample SMEs can be attributed to the fact that small businesses may not be directly and highly impacted by distance environmental risks such as major natural hazard-induced disasters and that the awareness about some of the environmental risks among the SMEs may be lower than other risks. Moreover, Turkey has not experienced a major natural hazard-induced disaster in the past 20 years, and major weather events have been very local.",

As more and more SMEs are connected with the national and global economies, their awareness about theses risks and the impacts that they could have for them will increase. This awareness can help SMEs to take these risks into consideration and prepare themselves for such risks. This study highlighted that SMEs' perceptions of the global risks are different from the businesses that operate at large scale at the global level. It also demonstrated that country's circumstances can affect SMEs' assessments of the likelihood, impacts, and rankings of global risks. It demonstrated that SMEs are more concerned about economic risks and risks that directly impact economic systems and variables, particularly geopolitical risks. Environmental risks, while important, are not at the top of the list for SMEs. Considering the significant role that SMEs play in local and national economies and the fact that they are concerned most about global economic and geopolitical risks, it can be argued that efforts towards lowering global economic and geopolitical risks can significantly benefit SMEs.",
