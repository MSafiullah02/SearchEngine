The first case was discovered in Korea in May 2015, after which the rapid transmission of the MERS-CoV resulted in 186 patients being diagnosed within 6 weeks. On December 23, 2015, the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare officially declared that the MERS-CoV outbreak had ended, with 186 laboratory-confirmed patients and 38 deaths. Among the MERS-confirmed Korean patients, 39 (21.0%) people were healthcare workers, 15 of whom (40%) were nurses (Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). This was the largest MERS-CoV outbreak outside of the Arabian Peninsula (Cowling et al., 2015).",

At the peak of the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Taiwan, nurses at a hospital caring for 27 suspected cases had trouble with psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and hostility (Chen, Cheng, Chung, & Lin, 2005). In Singapore, 27% of healthcare workers during the SARS outbreak were reported to have psychiatric symptoms (Chan & Huak, 2004). Fear and nervousness were the distressful experiences reported by healthcare workers taking care of patients with MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia (Khalid, Khalid, Qabajap, Barnard, & Qushmaq, 2016).

In Singapore, 49% healthcare workers during the SARS outbreak experienced social stigmatization because of their jobs (Koh et al., 2005). In a similar vein, Korean nurses working at hospitals with MERS-CoV patients were distanced by from their significant others (e.g., family or friends) and prohibited from using elevators at their apartments, and even their children were not allowed to attend kindergartens and schools (Jung & Cho, 2015).",

There is also rare empirical evidence of stigma among primary healthcare providers during the SARS outbreak in Singapore (Verma et al., 2004). Stigma was also considered as a source of perceived stress (Crocker et al., 1998, R\u0171sch et al., 2009). Consistent with this, previous studies have found stigma to be related to stress not only in people living with infectious disease (Charles et al., 2012) but also in the nurses caring for them (Hernandez, Morgan, & Parshall, 2016). Considering that perceived stress is well known to a predictor of mental health (Gomes et al., 2016, Lazarus and Folkman, 1984), stigma may indirectly influence mental health via stress. With a similar perspective, Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, and Link (2013) noticed that stress might mediate the linkage of stigma to health outcomes. Based on all of these findings, it was proposed in the present study that stigma exerts both direct effects on mental health and also indirect (mediated) effects on mental health via stress in nurses caring for patients with MERS-CoV.",

The first four subscales are categorized into the physical component summary, while the second four are categorized into the mental component summary (MCS). The MCS was used in this study to measure the mental health of nurses. The MCS score ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better mental health status. Cronbach's alpha of each subscale in the MCS ranged from 0.65 to 0.84 in this study: 0.77 for VT, 0.65 for SF, 0.84 for RE, and 0.80 for MH.

The first strength of this study was therefore in identifying the mechanism underlying how stigma and hardiness influence the mental health of nurses working at hospitals treating patients with the MERS-CoV. The second strength was that a simple partial-mediation model of the influences of stigma and hardiness on mental health via stress was assessed using the powerful approach of bootstrapping. The most widely used approach is that suggested by Baron and Kenny (1986), but that approach has been criticized as having a low statistical power (Field, 2013, MacKinnon et al., 2002). An alternative is the Sobel test, which requires the assumption that the indirect effect is normally distributed (Hays, 2009). However, the distribution actually tends to exhibit skewness and kurtosis (Edwards & Lambert, 2007). Currently the most powerful approach for a mediating-effect model involves the application of bootstrapping, which provides the advantage of not needing to make any assumptions about the sampling distribution (Hays, 2009).",
