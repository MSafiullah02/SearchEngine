In the LAMP assay, positive signals are indicated by turbidity that results from magnesium pyrophosphate precipitation following LAMP reaction. However, in this mechanism, the possibility of unexpected signals derived from primer dimer and/or non-primer reactions cannot be excluded (Njiru, 2012). There is also a possibility of detecting turbidity if the host-derived DNA makes LAMP product non-specifically. Thus, if unexpected signals are detected, it is very difficult to identify the origin of the signal. The validity of MERS-CoV detection by previous RT-LAMP assay has been confirmed (Shirato et al., 2014), but the mechanism of turbidity detection can be improved.",

The addition of DNA intercalator was used in Zika virus detection (Kurosaki et al., 2017). However, the detection principle of these methods is the same as turbidity detection. Using fluorescence labeled primer can solve the problem of non-primer-derived signals. Recently, Fowler et al. (2016) reported RT-LAMP assays for detection of vesicular stomatitis, foot and mouth diseases, and swine vesicular disease viruses using fluorescence labeled forward inner primers (FIPs) or backward inner primers (BIPs). However, this study used 5\u00b4 end-labeled primers. Therefore, if the fluorescent primer causes non-specific extension at the 3\u2032 end, unexpected signals will be detected. To avoid non-specific signals, melting curve analysis of the LAMP amplicon is useful to confirm amplification of the targeted sequence (Fowler et al., 2016; Kurosaki et al., 2017). However, melting curve analysis requires incubation of at a higher temperature than that LAMP, and requires additional time after amplification, which negates the main advantage of LAMP.",

Human respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV; Long, A2, B WV/14617/85 and 18537) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Human metapneumovirus (HMPV; Sendai-H/2404/2003) was obtained from the Virus Research Center, Sendai Medical Center, Japan. Human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E isolates ATCC VR-740 and Sendai-H/1121/04 (Shirato et al., 2012) were used. HCoV-NL63 was supplied by Dr. Lia van der Hoek, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. HCoV-OC43 isolate ATCC VR-1558 was used. SARS coronavirus (Frankfurt strain) was supplied by Dr. J. Ziebuhr, University of W\u00fcrzburg, Germany. Human parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1 (strain C35) and 3 (strain C243) were obtained from ATCC. Adenoviruses (ADVs) (serotype 3, strain G.B.; serotype 4, strain RI-67; and serotype 7, strain Gomen) were obtained from ATCC. Viruses were propagated and titrated using HEp-2, HeLa, RD, Vero cells, or LLC-Mk2 cells (Shirogane et al., 2008). Influenza viruses [Flu; A/California/7/2009 (H1N1pdm), A/Victoria/210/2009 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008] were propagated and titrated using MDCK cells.

The positive signal is shown as quenching of fluorescence, which generates a reverse sigmoid curve (Fig. 1b). In contrast, negative signals due to the lack of fluorescence quenching generate a straight line (Fig. 1b). The detection limit of the QProbe RT-LAMP assay was determined using serially diluted MERS-CoV RNA templates and was evaluated in comparison to those of real-time RT-PCR (upE and ORF1a) and RT-LAMP (turbidity) assays (Table 2\n). Although target regions of QProbe RT-LAMP assays were different from real-time RT-PCR assays, the validation was performed using copy number-determined viral RNA, and each amplification was performed using the same samples. As reported previously, both real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays are capable of detecting MERS-CoV RNA at a copy level as low as 20 (Corman et al., 2012a, Corman et al., 2012b; Shirato et al., 2014). As shown in Table 2, QProbe RT-LAMP assays, which targeted N and ORF1a sequences, were able to detect MERS-CoV RNA at a similar level, comparable to real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP.

Two MERS-CoV negative specimens were used as negative controls. Taking into consideration the recent MERS case occurrence rate, it was difficult to obtain fresh specimens; therefore, stored specimens were used for validation. Specimens deemed to be positive had quantification cycle values of 20.2\u201330.9 for the upE set. Using the N and ORF1a primer sets, QProbe RT-LAMP confirmed a positive diagnosis for all seven positive samples and a negative diagnosis for the other two. In short, the QProbe RT-LAMP assays developed in this study were capable of detecting MERS-CoV from human clinical specimens.",

However, significant genetic variations are present in these viral genomic regions as demonstrated by the large amount of sequences registered in GenBank. As shown in Table 1, 300 and 278/9 variations of nucleotide sequences for N and ORF1a have been registered in the database, with the majority of them showing a complete match to the corresponding primer set. Mismatches (1\u20133 base-pairs) were identified in several sequences when aligned with our primers (see Supplemental figure). In particular, the FIP primers had a high mismatch rate in the F2 region; the identities were 81.7% for N set and 86.0% for ORF1a set (Table 1). To determine whether QProbe RT-LAMP could amplify target sequences with mismatches to our primers, a panel of N and ORF1a RNA templates were synthesized by in vitro transcription, and QProbe RT-LAMP assays were performed using the appropriate primer sets (Table 6\nfor N, Table 7\nfor ORF1a). The detection limit of QProbe RT-LAMP for the EMC isolate sequence was 7.3\u201315.8 copies. QProbe RT-LAMP assays showed similar levels of amplification among all RNA template sequences, compared with that of the EMC isolate. The MERS-CoV sequences with mismatches were either of camel and/or human origin. Regardless of the target sequence origin, QProbe RT-LAMP well tolerated the nucleotide mismatches (1\u20133 base-pairs) without affecting the overall assay performance. In the previous study, mismatch in the B2 region (G29018T) slightly altered the amplification efficiency of RT-LAMP, leading to a five-fold decrease in detection sensitivity (Shirato et al., 2014). In contrast, the amplification efficiency in the QProbe RT-LAMP assays was not affected by mismatch in this region (Table 6). These findings indicate that the QProbe RT-LAMP assays could be used for the detection of all MERS-CoV isolates reported thus far, including for camels and humans.",

According to the case definition outlined by the WHO, positive amplification of at least two different virus-specific genomic targets is required for case confirmation. Two real-time RT-PCR assays were developed by Corman et al., using primer sets targeting upE and ORF1a region. These assays have been proven to be highly sensitive and specific; therefore, they are used as the standard diagnostic method for MERS-CoV (Corman et al., 2012a, Corman et al., 2012b). However, PCR amplification involves a relatively long running process and may be unsuitable for field-based studies. Recently, other genetic diagnostic methods using different mechanisms have been developed, which include RT-LAMP (Bhadra et al., 2015; Shirato et al., 2014) and reverse transcription isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) (Wahed et al., 2013). In this study, the QProbe RT-LAMP targeted different positions in the MERS-CoV genome [ORF1a (nt 1572\u20131753) and N] from Corman\u2019s assays [ORF1a (nt 18265\u201318314) and upE]. Two positives in the QProbe RT-LAMP or real-time PCR assays are enough, to confirm the presence of MERS-CoV. However, this means if the specimen is positive in two of four sets, it can be considered positive for MERS-CoV; if one of the real-time RT-PCR assay is negative, one positive QProbe RT-LAMP is sufficient for case confirmation, and vice versa. Thus, these techniques have improved the sensitivity and diagnostic outcomes of MERS-CoV by increasing the number of viral genomic targets available for amplification.",

            "text": "The results of RT-LAMP can be detected at the endpoint by checking magnesium pyrophosphate precipitation or fluorescent signal generated by DNA intercalators under ultraviolet light (Mori et al., 2001). Because they are easy to use, and they do not require large equipment for processing, RT-LAMP assays are more suitable for field-based studies. However, in turbidity monitoring, the salt accumulation accompanied by the LAMP reaction can be induced by primer dimers and/or non-primer reactions (Njiru, 2012). It is possible to detect unexpected increase in turbidity derived from non-primer signal, such as fragments of host DNA. Therefore, in this study, we developed a fluorescent RT-LAMP method with the addition of QProbes, in which only fluorescence quenching-derived from the probes was measured as a positive signal (Kurata et al., 2001). As such, QProbes provide additional specificity for detection as they bind to unique nucleotides that are only present in the target sequence and amplicon by LAMP primers. This means that a positive signal in the QProbe RT-LAMP assay is dependent on the primer reaction only. In addition, labeling the 3\u2032 end with fluorescence dye abrogates non-specific signals derived from primers because extension of the QProbe is physically blocked by the dye. Thus, QProbe allows for highly specific detection under isothermal conditions and in a short time without melting curve analysis. Furthermore, materials used in QProbe RT-LAMP assays can be prepared as lyophilized form and packaged into diagnostic kits, increasing product integrity during shipment and handling. As demonstrated using clinical specimens (Table 5), this assay could be run in a portable device (e.g., ESEQuant TS2) and be completed in 30 min or less for accurate diagnosis of MERS-CoV, making it more suitable for field-based studies. We also showed that the two primer sets constructed in the study (targeting the viral N and ORF1a sequences) were equally capable of detecting MERS-CoV RNA. This means that a positive diagnosis can be confirmed by QProbe RT-LAMP alone without the need for other confirmation methods.",

In fact, these assays demonstrated comparable levels of sensitivity and specificity in detecting MERS-CoV genetic variants as the EMC strain, which was used for primer construction. When using LAMP, mismatches in primer sequences seem to be tolerated, but mismatches can occur in the primer\u2019s 3\u2032 end and the BIP primer should be avoided (Peyrefitte et al., 2008; Wang, 2016).
