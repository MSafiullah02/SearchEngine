            "text": "The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) revealed a new dimension in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. miRNAs are small, noncoding RNA molecules of~22 nucleotides, which typically repress messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by binding to their 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) (reviewed in [1] [2] [3] [4] ). miRNAs are transcribed as primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs), which contain a hairpinlike structure that will produce the mature miRNAs [5] . Most miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II from independent promoters, analogous to typical protein-coding genes [5] . However, transcription can also be dependent on RNA polymerase III when the miRNA is located downstream of repetitive elements such as Alu elements [6] . Alternatively, miRNAs can be embedded within long noncoding RNA or in an intron of a proteincoding gene, which releases the pri-miRNA in the process of splicing [7] . In this case, miRNA tran-scription is coupled to its host gene. Furthermore, several miRNAs are organized in genomic clusters, which produce a single polycistronic primary transcript that contains the hairpins of several miR-NAs. Typically, these miRNAs have related biological functions [8] . To form a mature miRNA, the pri-miRNA hairpin is the substrate for two subsequent cleavage steps by members of the RNase III family. In the nucleus, it is recognized by the RNase III enzyme Drosha to produce the pre-miRNA, a~70-nt-long precursor molecule, which is then exported to the cytoplasm by exportin-5. Because the structure of the processed pre-miRNA is the signal for nuclear export, the transport is independent of capping or polyadenylation status of the primary transcript [7] .",

The specificity of the interaction is determined by a stretch of six to eight nucleotides in the 5\u2032 end of the miRNA, its socalled seed region, which has perfect complementarity to the target mRNA. The rest of the miRNA sequence is less complementary to the target mRNA, which results in a bulged structure [9] . The central RISC component, a protein of the Argonaute family, can interact with a range of regulatory factors, such as GW182 and Rck/p54, which link the RISC to processing (P) bodies, where factors involved in mRNA degradation and translational repression are concentrated [10] . As a consequence, targeted mRNA molecules can be degraded following deadenylation and decapping and/or translationally repressed by inhibition of initiation and elongation [11, 12] . The relative importance of mRNA degradation versus translation inhibition is still a matter of debate but, given that these are highly coupled processes, it is likely that both are important and influence each other [13] .",

            "text": "The miRNA-223 (miR-223) is transcribed from an independent promoter, which shows specific expression in the haematopoietic system [15] [16] [17] . A high expression level is seen in cells of the myeloid lineage, with granulocytes showing the highest levels [18] (see Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, miR-223 is upregulated during retinoic acid (RA)induced differentiation of promyelocytic leukaemia cell lines NB4 and HL60, as well as in primary leukaemic cells. This is caused by the induction of miR-223 gene expression by the myeloid transcription factors PU.1 and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) b [19, 20] . The nuclear factor I-A (NFI-A) can maintain lower levels of miR-223 and stabilize the undifferentiated state of precursor cells as it competes for binding with C/EBPa, another strong inducer of miR-223 transcription [20, 21] . It is interesting that both NFI-A and C/ EBPb are direct targets of miR-223, thus forming negative feedback loops [20, 22] . Fazi et al. also showed that overexpression of miR-223 is sufficient to induce markers of differentiation in a myeloid precursor cell line and that inhibition of miR-223 reduces the efficiency of RA-induced differentiation [20] . Taken together, upregulation of miR-223 is clearly an important element of granulopoiesis, which is coordinated by the combined action of different myeloid transcription factors (Fig. 1) .",

Of interest, miR-223 \u00c0/Y mice did not fail to produce granulocytes; instead, granulocyte numbers were increased. The authors attributed this to the deregulation of Mef2c, a transcription factor that drives granulocyte-monocyte progenitor proliferation and is targeted by miR-223. Indeed, conditional deletion of Mef2c in the myeloid lineage of miR-223 \u00c0/Y animals results in normal numbers of granulocytes. miR-223 \u00c0/Y mice were also reported to produce hyperactive neutrophils and present with spontaneous lung inflammation, which was not mediated by Mef2c. Therefore, miR-223 seems to be involved in the regulation of the early and late stages of granulopoiesis, as well as in the homeostasis of mature neutrophils. These findings were independently confirmed by reconstituting mice with bone marrow that expresses a miR-223 sponge construct, which acts as a miR-223 inhibitor. This study showed that impairing miR-223 function in the haematopoietic compartment replicates the phenotype of the miR-223 \u00c0/Y mouse [25] .",

            "text": "Besides granulocyte differentiation, miR-223 has been found to be involved in determining the identity of other cell types in the haematopoietic system. Together with other miRNAs, miR-223 fine-tunes the differentiation of myeloid precursors into either granulocytes or monocytes. As described above, miR-223 is strongly induced by C/EBPa, a transcription factor that drives granulocyte differentiation. As miR-223 targets the NFI-A mRNA, proliferation of myeloid precursors is reduced upon C/EBPa activation, and the differentiation programme can be initiated [20] . Similarly, during osteoclast differentiation from precursors of the myeloid lineage, miR-223 upregulation by PU.1 is important to repress NFI-A, which would otherwise inhibit differentiation [26] . The importance for myeloid differentiation has also been demonstrated using an antagomiR inhibitor of miR-223, which abolishes GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor)induced differentiation of monocytes and PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate)-induced differentiation of THP1 cells [27] . Interestingly, the authors also showed that miR-223 is enriched in microvesicles shed from differentiated macrophages and that these vesicles are sufficient to induce differentiation in monocytes. An increasing number of studies show that microvesicles (exosomes or microparticles) are a means of intercellular communication [28] that can even act over long distances because they can be found in the circulation. Even Fig. 1 Expression of miR-223 during haematopoiesis. miR-223 expression increases as haematopoietic progenitor cells differentiate into red blood cells or natural killer cells, but decreases during differentiation into neutrophils, monocytes, megakaryocytes and eosinophils. Expression is also altered as these cells are further activated (neutrophils and natural killer cells) or polarized (macrophages). though blocked differentiation by miR-223 inhibition implies a positive role of the miRNA on macrophage differentiation, we and others have shown that miR-223 is downregulated in macrophages compared with monocytes [24, 29, 30 ] (see Fig. 1 ). Nevertheless, the strong effect of miR-223 inhibition described above suggests that a low functional level of the miRNA is essential for monocyte differentiation.",

            "text": "When maintained on a high-fat diet, miR-223 \u00c0/Y mice revealed an additional inflammatory phenotype with more severe adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance [34] . This was accompanied by increased infiltration of macrophages and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the adipose tissue. Furthermore, the infiltrating macrophages expressed higher levels of markers of the classically activated pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1), suggesting a defect in macrophage polarization. On a molecular level, this deregulation may be partly due to the novel miR-223 target Pknox1. By targeting Pknox1, miR-223 helps to steer the activation pattern of macrophages towards the alternative M2 phenotype. In the context of obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation, this is beneficial as it reduces adverse metabolic phenotypes. This is in agreement with recent findings by us and others regarding macrophage differentiation. As monocytes differentiate into macrophages (or dendritic cells), NLRP3, an important protein for the processing of the IL-1b and IL-18, is upregulated, although its mRNA levels are downregulated [30, 35] . This coincides with lower expression of miR-223 in mature myeloid cells. As miR-223 can target the NLRP3 3\u2032UTR, it can prevent translation early in the myeloid lineage. Given the high miR-223 expression levels, the miRNA is likely to be an important regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophils [35] . Other groups have also found that miR-223 may influence IL-1b production, in this case due to an effect on STAT3 [36] . miR-223 downregulation was found to promote the production of IL-1b and IL-6 at a transcriptional level. Furthermore, miR-223 cooperated with miR-15a and miR-16 to enhance noncanonical NF-jB signalling during macrophage differentiation. These miRNAs were all found to target the inhibitor of NF-jB kinase a (IKKa). As the levels of all three miRNA decrease during macrophage differentiation, repression of IKKa is relieved and NF-jB signalling increases [29] . miR-223 expression also changes when other cell types are activated, for example in natural killer (NK) cells treated with IL-15. Here, decreased miR-223 levels result in increased expression of its target granzyme B, an effector of cytotoxic lymphocytes [37] . miR-223 is not only involved in the differentiation of a variety of immune cells, especially macrophages, but can also influence their activation pattern. For example, it can modulate macrophage polarization, as well as inflammasome and NF-jB signalling.",

Indeed, Johnnidis et al. showed enhanced killing of neutrophils co-cultured with Candida albicans in miR-223 mutant mice (miR-223 \u00c0/Y ), indicating increased fungicidal activity in these animals. Furthermore, miR-223 \u00c0/Y mice exhibited elevated tissue destruction after endotoxin challenge [24] . Endotoxin challenge is a model of sepsis, a severe form of infection associated with inflammatory clinical symptoms such as fever, chills, malaise and high inflammatory cytokine levels. In the light of these data from miR-223 mutant mice, the observation that miR-223 expression is decreased during sepsis suggests that this miRNA could have a role in the disease pathology rather than serving as a biomarker alone [47] . Again this reflects the importance of miR-223 in negative regulation of the inflammatory process during infection.",

Recently, MG Katze and colleagues found that miR-223 and other microRNAs were differentially expressed in response to influenza virus infection [48] . More specifically, miR-223 was strongly upregulated in r1918 infection and only moderately upregulated in control influenza infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a twenty-first-century pandemic infection with typical clinical features of pulmonary fibrosis and lung failure that led to significant mortality, is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV. Although SARS-CoV cannot infect or replicate in fully differentiated cells, it is possible to study the virus in infected bronchoalveolar stem cells [49] . Using this method, Mallick et al. showed that miR-223 amongst other miRNAs is downregulated during infection. Furthermore, they demonstrated potential targets of miR-223 in both the virus (N protein) and the host (CCR1), although these targets remain to be validated. In another study, it was found that miR-223 is elevated in serum from patients with chronic type B hepatitis, to a similar extent as in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), suggesting it may be a marker of liver injury [50] . Although it is not clear how higher levels in the serum relate to the expression levels of this miRNA in cells, it is tempting to speculate from the finding that miR-223 is downregulated in HCC and that it may also be downregulated in chronic type B hepatitis. As discussed above, miR-223 may act as a negative regulator of inflammation, which could explain the chronic inflammatory response in the liver if miR-223 is repressed.",

Furthermore, together with other miRNAs, miR-223 was found to target the 3\u2032 ends of HIV-1 messenger RNAs. In resting CD4+ T cells (where HIV replication is silenced), miR-223 expression was increased compared with the level in activated CD4+ T cells. Inhibition of miR-223 alone or in combination with other miR-NAs resulted in HIV-1 production from resting CD4+ T cells [51] . The physiological relevance of this finding is still questionable as resting CD4+ T cells are not the main reservoir of HIV (<1%). In another study, it was shown in macrophages that miR-223 and other cellular HIV-1 interfering factors are induced by type I interferons, which could be one of the mechanisms of their antiviral activity [53] .",

The invasive phenotype of modulating miR-223 levels can be recapitulated by altering the level of the novel miR-223 target EPB41L3, a cytoskeletal linker protein involved in motility and adhesion. In stark contrast, miR-223 seems to be suppressing migration and invasiveness in oesophageal cancer lines, potentially by targeting the oncogene Artemin [71] . It remains to be determined whether this discrepancy can be explained by the different cell origins. Furthermore, in recurrent ovarian cancer, miR-223 is overexpressed compared with primary tumours, which could indicate a metastatic signature [72] .",

Nevertheless, it has pronounced effects on proliferation and invasiveness in other cell types. Therefore, the question arises, 'How can such effects be explained in a physiological setting?' One possibility is trafficking of miRNA between cells in microvesicles, which is emerging as an important mechanism by which cells exchange regulatory factors as described above [28] . Indeed, miR-223 appears to be actively transferred from IL4-stimulated tumour-associated macrophages to co-cultured breast cancer cells, which leads to increased invasiveness in the cancer cells [73] . Thus, miR-223 could act as a signal in the crosstalk between tumour and immune cells in the tumour microenvironment.",

In mouse models, this induction requires the downregulation of miR-223 and consequent upregulation of its target Mef2c in the suppressor cells [74] . Consequently, reconstitution of irradiated and cancer-bearing mice with bone marrow cells that overexpress miR-223 or lack Mef2c suppresses tumour growth, whereas miR-223 inhibition and Mef2c overexpression has the opposite effect.",

Its role in regulating differentiation is very important for cancers of haematopoietic origin, where dedifferentiation is a common feature, as it increases the proliferative potential. miR-223 can alter several of the hallmarks of cancer that were defined by Hanahan and Weinberg [75] , such as regulating cell cycle, cell survival, metastasis and immune evasion. Given its predominance in microvesicles from various cell types, it can play an important role in the crosstalk between cancer cells and the microenvironment. In many cases, miR-223 seems to function as a tumour-suppressive miRNA, targeting predominantly oncogenic effectors and being silenced in cancer cells. However, in other cases, miR-223 is overexpressed. This could reflect varying cellular requirements in different stages of tumour development and different tumour origins, for example in the primary tumour mass versus metastatic cells. More generally, it probably reflects the complexity of miRNA regulation. With the large number and diversity of targets, it seems unlikely that a single miRNA will have exclusively tumoursuppressive or oncogenic effects. The ultimate outcome will depend on the cell type, the tumour microenvironment and the network of other expressed effectors.",

The changes in miR-223 expression in different haematopoietic cell types as well as genetic interference using knockout and miRNA sponge methods convincingly support a central role in differentiation, particularly in the myeloid lineage. Recently, evidence has pointed to an important role of miR-223 in altering macrophage polarization and activation. Given its role in basic cellular functions such as proliferation and survival, it is not surprising that miR-223 has a potential to alter cancer cell phenotypes. This has been observed not only in haematological malignancies but also in solid tumours. These findings together with the pronounced effects of miR-223 on the immune response suggest that this miRNA is part of the exciting link between inflammation and cancer [76] .",

It is important to recognize that, due to cellular specificity of miR-223 expression, altered miR-223 levels may simply reveal an imbalance in the number of cells that express high levels of this miRNA. Nevertheless, pooling these data makes it possible to speculate about the role of validated miR-223 targets (Table 1) in the pathologies in which miR-223 is deregulated. For example, E2F1, Foxo1, C/EBPb and RHOB are implicated as miR-223 targets in cancer; however, these proteins are also extensively involved in inflammation and infection and might contribute to the effect of miR-223 in these settings. Furthermore, granzyme B, NLRP3, Pknox1 and Roquin have been discussed above in the context of inflammation, but they may also account for the functions of miR-223 in the development of cancer. Continued effort to understand and relate phenotypes and molecular observations will provide better insight into the biology of miR-223.",
