By March 11, 2020 , the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection outside China had increased 13fold, and the number of affected countries had tripled. With more than 118,000 people affected by the virus worldwide and 4,291 deaths, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was a pandemic. 1 Shortly after the pandemic declaration, medical boards and societies released guidelines stating that medical professionals should use their clinical judgement when scheduling elective surgeries and procedures. 2 As shortages of personal protective equipment aggravated the insufficiencies of health care systems, many hospital and health care providers decided to stop all elective activity, including cancer screening. 3 The role of cancer screening in early detection and its impact on survival is well documented in breast, cervical, lung, and colorectal cancers. 4 Consequently, insurers and health officials use cancer screening participation rates as an index for the quality of care. As a result, the number of people screened for cancer and diagnosed at an early stage has been growing steadily. 4 For the first time, cancer screening has been globally interrupted. As the number of new COVID-19 cases, related deaths, and affected countries increases, interruptions of cancer screening schedules are expected to last. 5 This presents oncologists with some unprecedented challenges.",

            "text": "Over 70% of women between ages 50 and 74 in the U.S. reported a recent mammogram, and similar rates were noted in other Western countries. 11, 12 There are nearly 50 million women in this age range in the U.S., which means that 1,412,000 women have mammograms each month. Based on a recent cross-national comparison of screening mammography accuracy measures, the positive predictive value (i.e., the number of screening-detected breast cancers divided by the number of recalls due to positive mammographic findings) in the U.S. is 4.9% (range, 4.8 to 16.7%); 13 and the number of women who need to be recalled to undergo an invasive procedure to detect 1 breast cancer in the U.S. is 20.3 (range, 6 to 20.7). 14 Thus, for each month that breast cancer screening programs are shut down due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 69,629 breast cancer patients will go undiagnosed, increasing their risk for delayed treatment and poor prognosis. 15 Lung cancer is a time-sensitive malignancy; it is estimated that early-stage lung cancer diagnosis could save over 70,000 lives a year. 16 The average 5-year survival rate for lung cancer (17%) is among the lowest of all types of cancer but is higher (52%) when the disease is diagnosed at an early, asymptomatic stage. However, only 15% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at such a stage. 17 According to the U.S. Census data, 13.2% of adults aged 55 to 80 years nationwide are eligible for low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening. Given national participation rates, each month approximately 25,000 adults are screened, and over 1,200 patients with positive screening results are diagnosed with lung cancer. 18 The large numbers of patients eligible for screening will make it difficult for screening programs to recuperate once they resume their normal schedules, especially as the duration of the pandemic increases. Moreover, with the large expected financial ramifications of the pandemic, funds directed towards screening efforts are at risk of being diverted to other causes even after the pandemic is over. At first glance, the cost of screening programs appears higher than delaying treatment until there is clinical evidence of disease, due to the number needed to screen for each of the screening tests. However, previous studies have demonstrated that cost of a screening program increases the cost of care in exchange for decreased patient morbidity and mortality. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] In breast, for example, cost of care with a screening program is estimated to be $63 billion (2000 USD) more than cost of care without a screening program over 10 years. 23 However, this results in a gain of 1.7 million quality-adjusted life years (QALY), with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $37,000 USD per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Generally, an ICER of less than $50 000 USD per QALY is accepted as a price worth paying for a decrease in patient morbidity and mortality. Lung cancer screening programs have also been demonstrated to be cost effective, with an estimated ICER of $49,200 USD per QALY. 22 Thus, although cancer screening efforts result in increased upfront expenses, the longer term benefits to patient quality of life and longevity need to be considered.",

In the intervening time period, patients may develop clinical disease, and we may face an increasing proportion of patients presenting with advanced-stage breast and lung cancer that will require multimodal treatment and will cause increased morbidity and mortality. While the absolute costs of screening efforts exceed those of no screening, consideration of the quality life-years gained is essential to the long-term wellness of the population. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created a new reality that many of us have not experienced before. Given the amount of uncertainty, the aggressive response of most health authorities was needed. Today, a few weeks into the crisis, as data accumulates, we still don't know how long the pandemic will last and this \"knee-jerk\" response should be revisited. Considering the lower mortality rate of COVID-19 than of breast or lung cancer in similarly aged populations, the postponement of time-sensitive screening tests should be avoided or at list minimized. As resources are diverted to treat the acute needs of patients with COVID-19, a thoughtful approach is needed to determine how to allocate any remaining resources to usual health care functions. Especially in the aftermath of the pandemic, we can expect a large surge in health care activity as systems attempt to play \"catch-up\" for the months dedicated to fighting the pandemic. It is easy to imagine that cancer screening may 7 become a low priority and be further deferred. However, considering the prognostic effect, cost-utility ramifications, and the large populations affected, cancer screening needs to be continually brought to the table when considering how to allocate rare resources. Risk stratification strategies may need to be refined and employed to triage patients within disease systems to identify those who might benefit most from screening efforts. Most importantly, cross-disciplinary discussions need to be open and collaborative to allow for an organized and thoughtful plan to optimally distribute resources for the benefit of the population. Cancer screening programs may need to merge their efforts to jointly prioritize screening resources to minimize long-term morbidity and mortality for the largest group of patients at the lowest cost.",
