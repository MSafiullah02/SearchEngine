A single miRNA may target hundreds of mRNAs, and one mRNA may be regulated by multiple miRNAs (6, 31), yielding an environment in which target gene expression can be finely tuned based on changing cellular conditions. MiRNAs are found both intracellularly and extracellularly and display distinct expression profiles across various tissues, cell types, and body fluids (29, 32, 65). The potential of miRNAs to act as tissue-specific master regulators and the relative ease of assaying circulating miRNA levels make them intriguing candidates as biomarkers to monitor disease processes or drug response. Furthermore, recent technological advances permit large-scale miRNA profiling, yielding the opportunity to better define the genome regulatory networks related to disease processes.",

Agglomerating these diverse etiologies into a relatively nonspecific clinical phenotype may reduce the ability to identify the genomic architecture underpinning the various pathways. An alternative approach is to use circulating protein biomarkers as endophenotypes of ACS, as these circulating proteins may represent more granular intermediate phenotypes of the fundamental biological process. In genetic and genomic studies, the underlying premise behind this approach is that intermediate traits, such as biomarker levels, may reside closer to the underlying etiologic gene and therefore provide a stronger genetic signal for association studies than using a downstream, potentially more heterogeneous, clinical phenotype (1, 10, 50).",

For example, NH2-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels are powerful diagnostic and prognostic indicators for heart failure (37), and C-reactive protein levels are associated with heart failure and mortality in survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI) (54). However, the genetic and genomic regulation of prognostic biomarkers in ACS is incompletely understood. Given the ubiquitous nature of miRNA regulation of downstream targets, it is likely that miRNAs play important roles in underlying genomic regulatory networks associated with circulating levels of protein biomarkers. Identifying relationships between miRNAs and prognostic biomarkers may shed further light on genomic determinants of ACS outcomes.",

Worldwide, NSTE-ACS is now the predominant form of ACS, and long-term outcomes of NSTE-ACS have been shown to be poorer than outcomes of ST-segment elevation ACS (8). We studied the association of circulating miRNAs and biomarkers of known prognostic value in NSTE-ACS [NT-proBNP, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), osteopontin (OPN), myeloperoxidase (MPO), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), and neopterin]. We applied next-generation sequencing technology to examine the relationship between baseline circulating miRNA profiles and 30-day protein biomarker levels, with the goals of better understanding how genomic regulatory networks activated during NSTE-ACS may be associated with adverse biomarker profiles, and providing a resource of miRNA-biomarker associations that might be used to generate plausible hypotheses in future studies.",

Most TRILOGY participants were medically managed without revascularization during the index hospitalization. Therefore, the majority of recurrent ACS events (96%) were spontaneous and not related to revascularization procedures. The primary trial results showed no significant difference in the primary composite outcome between the two treatment arms (47). Subjects for this analysis were selected from the TRILOGY Advanced Biomarker SubStudy (TRILOGY-ABSS, n = 1,391) and were eligible for inclusion if they had available baseline RNA samples extracted from whole blood and valid plasma and serum biomarker data available from a sample collected 30 days postenrollment. Patients were initially considered as a matched case-control sample: cases were defined as patients who experienced a recurrent event (cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke) within 1 yr of randomization (n = 108 eligible subjects), while controls did not experience an event during study follow-up (n = 637 eligible subjects with at least 1 yr of follow-up). The final cohort was not a matched sample, as different numbers of cases (n = 89) and controls (n = 100) were selected to be sequenced; instead, the groups were broadly matched on the following variables: age at randomization, race, sex, previous clopidogrel use, presentation with unstable angina versus non-ST elevation MI, and treatment group (prasugrel versus clopidogrel). In this analysis, case/control status was considered as a confounder and included as a covariable in the model (see Statistical analysis section). Seven samples were sequenced twice to serve as technical replicates.",

The trimmed reads were aligned to the human genome (GRCh38) with bowtie v1.0.1 (33), permitting one mismatch per read and reporting up to five best alignments for each read. Reads that mapped to more than 10 locations were discarded. Aligned reads were then mapped to miRNA primary transcripts from miRBase v21 (n = 2,813 miRNAs) (30) with the coverageBed function from bedtools v2.21.0 (44), which allows potentially ambiguous reads to be counted in each miRNA instead of being discarded. Using this approach, we detected 1,423 miRNAs at a rate of \u22650.1 mapped reads/million aligned reads (rpm) in at least one sample. The mapped reads included a high preponderance of miR-486-5p (approx. 80% of all mapped reads), which is highly expressed by erythrocytes (43) and has been suggested as a marker of hemolysis (27). MiR-486-5p has also been reported to be enriched 50\u00d7 in samples prepared with the Illumina library prep used here versus two other kits tested (21), thus these reads were removed from the analysis. All remaining detected miRNAs were filtered with an expression level cut-off that maximized the Spearman correlation of miRNA levels within the seven pairs of technical replicates. Using a final cut-off of \u22651 rpm in \u226520 samples, we retained 247 miRNAs for analysis. One sample failed alignment quality control checks, and two had high proportions of rRNA (indicating potential sample quality issues); these three samples were removed, yielding a final analysis set of 186 samples.",

We used an analogous model to test for differential expression of miRNAs between samples with and without a recurrent event, adjusting for all covariables except recurrent event status.

Experimentally validated mRNA targets of significant miRNAs were identified with Tarbase v7.0 (58) and tested for enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways in target genes using DIANA mirPath v3 (59), with the \u201cpathways union\u201d option and P values derived from the hypergeometric distribution (FDR < 1%).

Figure 2B displays the nominal \u2212log10\nP values for each miRNA/biomarker association test; the majority of significant miRNA associations (P < 0.05) occur with OPN and NT-proBNP.

Using this approach in a subpopulation of subjects from a clinical trial of medically managed NSTE-ACS, we have identified a set of miRNAs associated with OPN and NT-proBNP levels that meet rigorous adjustment for multiple comparisons.

            "text": "OPN is a matricellular protein that regulates inflammation and biomineralization, making it an obvious candidate as a biomarker for cardiovascular phenotypes, as atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process (49), and active biomineralization and microcalcification are key features of unstable coronary plaques (22). While OPN is expressed in a variety of tissues, including immune cells, bone, kidney, and gallbladder, it is only found at low levels in cardiac tissue under normal physiological conditions. Expression of OPN is increased under various pathological conditions such as ACS (53), heart failure (51), and aortic stenosis (35), and elevated OPN levels strongly predict mortality in patients with heart failure (48). Several of the miRNAs found to be associated with OPN levels in this study have previously reported associations with cardiac phenotypes, and the associations with OPN levels provide plausible hypotheses for intermediate steps in the pathway between miRNA expression and disease. For example, one of the miRNAs most strongly associated with OPN levels in our study, miR-378 (P = 2.04 \u00d7 10\u22125), has been reported to be significantly upregulated in mobilized CD34+ progenitor cells in patients with ST-elevation MI compared with healthy patients (55). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments reveal miR-378 as a key regulator of the proangiogenic capacity of CD34+ cells, which aids the preservation and recovery of left ventricular function in patients with MI, but the exact mechanism of this effect is unclear. As OPN has been widely implicated in angiogenesis (11, 63), the strong association between miR-378 and OPN levels may suggest a plausible pathway by which miR-378 exerts its proangiogenic activity. Another of the top miRNAs associated with OPN levels in this study is miR-320a (P = 3.63 \u00d7 10\u22124), which has previously been associated with cardiac injury following ischemia/reperfusion in mice (45), reduced ejection fraction (2), and heart failure (17). The association between miRNA-320 levels and OPN suggests one potential mechanism underlying these phenotypic associations: TLR4 is also associated with reduced ejection fraction (2), and OPN has been reported to negatively regulate TLR4-mediated immune responses. Several other miRNAs associated with OPN have relevant reported associations for which our results may provide plausible biological pathways: miR-320b is released from activated platelets in patients with ACS and has been shown in vitro to have downstream effects on ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells (16); miR-99b-5p has been associated with endothelial cell differentiation from pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (26); and miR-155 is downregulated in coronary atherosclerotic plaques (19, 62). Taken together, these previous associations and our results suggest potential roles for miRNAs and OPN in the regulation of disease progression in NSTE-ACS.",

            "text": "NT-proBNP is a 32-amino acid polypeptide with diuretic and natriuretic effects and is released from the myocardium in response to mechanical stretch or endocrine signaling (18). Higher levels of NT-proBNP are strongly associated with heart failure and mortality after ACS (13), while therapies that lower NT-proBNP levels are associated with improved prognosis (25). Recently, a compound that inhibits neprilysin, which breaks down biological active natriuretic peptides, was shown to improve outcomes in heart failure (39). Several miRNAs associated with NT-proBNP levels in our analysis have been previously reported to be associated with other cardiovascular phenotypes. MiR-25 shows the strongest association with NT-proBNP levels in our analysis (P = 7.5 \u00d7 10\u22124), and its expression has been shown to differentiate patients presenting with ST elevation versus non-ST elevation MI (64) and is also increased in response to oxidative stress (41). Expression of another top result, miR-186-5p (P = 0.0015), has been associated with early stages of acute MI (61). In our analysis, NT-proBNP levels and expression of both miR-25 and miR-186-5p were negatively correlated, and the significance of this inconsistent direction of effect remains to be explored. MiR-328-3p (P = 0.0035) has also been shown to be associated with acute MI and subsequent heart failure and mortality (20). Both miR-25 and miR-328-3p are known to regulate calcium reuptake in cardiomyocytes via repression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake pump SERCA2a. MiR-25 was shown to delay calcium uptake kinetics in vivo, while antisense miR-25 rescued the resulting heart failure phenotype in a mouse model (60). MiR-328 has been shown to promote cardiac hypertrophy by directly repressing SERCA2a expression in transgenic mice overexpressing miR-328 in the heart (34). Interestingly, BNP decreases the expression of SERCA2a (28, 56), so the reported miRNA/biomarker associations here may help provide a fuller context for the relevant mechanisms.",

This raises the question of whether the mRNA targets of the NT-proBNP-associated miRNAs identified here are recapitulating associations discovered in these genetic studies. One of the 10 NT-proBNP-associated miRNAs reported here, miR-148b-3p, is known to be associated with one of the NT-proBNP-associated loci (CLCN6) (5, 42). This suggests that our results are outside the realm of germline variation that affects NT-proBNP levels, and the genomic regulatory architecture of the relationship between miRNAs and NT-proBNP cannot solely be described through germline genetic variation.",

In fact, four miRNAs were significantly associated with both OPN and NT-proBNP (miR-148b-3p, miR-423-3p/-5p, miR-140-3p, and miR-877-5p), suggesting that there may be some shared genetic regulatory elements. In addition to these overlapping miRNAs, several shared KEGG pathways showed enrichment of downstream mRNA targets, including the prion disease pathway (the strongest results for both biomarkers), fatty acid biosynthesis, proteoglycans in cancer, viral carcinogenesis, and ECM-receptor interaction. Several of the genes in the prion disease pathway are associated with cardiovascular phenotypes [e.g., heat shock protein 70 (23) and Notch1 (57)], but the predicted targets in this pathway are broadly involved in cellular processes such as apoptosis and proliferation, suggesting that this pathway may be reporting on common cellular processes also implicated in atherosclerosis and cardiac function, as opposed to processes specific to the brain or neural tissue. The other pathways enriched for both biomarkers show similar features: genes with relatively high expression in multiple tissues, often targets of both OPN- and NT-proBNP-associated miRNAs, implicated in a range of cellular and metabolic processes. More work is needed to determine whether the associations reported here reflect miRNAs and potential regulatory pathways specific to individual biomarkers, as opposed to more global regulators.",

While many of the miRNAs identified in this unbiased analysis are extremely plausible candidates based on previous studies, these results should be validated in independent cohorts. Additionally, it is important to note that the current results are only associations, cannot be used to confirm biological relationships, and may not reflect causality: a recent study showed that OPN regulates miR-21 expression in mice (35), underscoring the fact that the regulatory pathways involved are likely complex and may involve multiple layers of feedback. We have tested for associations between miRNAs measured at the time of ACS presentation and protein biomarkers measured 30 days later but do not have longitudinal measurements that might allow us to look at time profiles of the miRNAs and biomarkers. Additionally, the associations reported here are between circulating miRNAs and protein biomarkers, which may not reflect levels found in cardiac tissue. Even with these caveats, the convergence of many of our findings with previous studies suggesting a role for these miRNAs in ACS lends important evidence for the validity of our results. Our study extends the results of these prior studies by elucidating the potential biological pathways regulated by these miRNAs through integration with protein biomarkers.",

Among the miRNAs identified here, many have been previously reported to be associated with a wide range of relevant phenotypes and processes including heart failure, cardiac contractility, cardiac remodeling, apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, and acute MI. This work extends the current understanding of the role of these miRNAs to suggest that their associations with cardiovascular phenotypes may be mediated through pathways that also involve NT-proBNP or OPN, and additionally provides an atlas of miRNA-protein biomarker associations that may serve as a valuable resource of hypotheses for future work delineating the pathways that connect known cardiovascular-related miRNAs to clinical phenotypes and outcomes. Additionally, we have novel findings for miRNAs not previously reported to be associated with cardiovascular phenotypes. These novel miRNAs are therefore good candidates for future work, based on their association with established prognostic protein biomarkers. Further studies, including deeper functional evaluations, may give insight into how genetic and genomic networks converge with functional protein pathways to cause cardiovascular events.",
