            "text": "We all know of the famous Adam Smith concept of absolute advantage to explain the benefits of global trade. It is one of the earliest globalization ideas. It describes how trade potentializes the relative efficiencies of two economies. Suppose, for instance, that English firms are more efficient producing wool and French firms more efficient producing wine. Instead of each country producing both goods domestically, the absolute advantage argument is that both England and France would be better off producing what they do best and trading\u2014wool exports to France and wine exports to England. Adam Smith was right in that the joint output would be greater and that both countries would be richer as a result. However, there is also an opposite argument in favor of market protection. Despite the overall gain in common wealth, trade can create losers. English wine producers and French wool producers would likely be harmed by free, open trade. Their interest stages the argument for market protections.",

            "text": "The clash between these two opposing arguments did not fundamentally change in nearly 250 years. In fact, it is as relevant today as ever. After a prolonged push for increased global trade following World War II, there is currently pushback in some settings. Think of renegotiating the NAFTA Treaty, the \u201ctrade war\u201d with China, and Brexit as cases in point. Still, there are forces, such as remaining trade agreements, China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, and investment flows that continue to favor trade. As a result, we find ourselves facing an unprecedented level of uncertainty and change in global trade.",

            "text": "Change in global trade is principally driven by economic, technological, political, and natural factors. On the economic side, some countries increase/decrease their footprint either as producers of goods and services or as markets for imports. Technological innovation can also increase a country\u2019s footprint and improve the cost and service of global trade itself. Further, the ideology espoused by governments influences trade\u2010related policies, from more open to more protectionist. Recently, firms were challenged by another type of global change, the threat posed by the spread of the coronavirus labeled COVID\u201019. In this instance, a health crisis has forced businesses to reconsider the logistics of people and freight across national boundaries in an effort to control the spread of contagion. This challenge in some cases made firms aware of their dependence on a single source of supply, leading them to make radical changes to their supply chains. Overall, these changes impose major challenges to supply chains; whether they are directly engaged in global trade or are, instead, a domestic supply chain affected by global actors.",

            "text": "Expansion or repatriation of global supply chains generally affects their length. When longer, supply chains operate across more legal jurisdictions and economic systems; and deal with labor pools with different talent levels, work rules, and wages. They also operate with transportation systems varying in efficiency and cost; and face different risks in economic stability and proclivity for natural disasters. Shorter supply chains tend to be simpler to manage but are less capable to take advantage of opportunities in global markets for sources of supply and customers.",

            "text": "At the firm level, whenever production facilities or distribution hubs are relocated or repurposed, issues such as network redesign come to the fore. A change in one node requires changes in many other nodes, whether they are directly related to global trade or not. Location factors, in turn, impact issues such as labor management, sustainability, transportation cost, and inventory/warehousing cost. And, of course, there is the additional need to acquire new management skills and remove outdated ones. Finally, trade uncertainty adds risk, both operational and financial, clouding investment decisions. These changes at the firm level clearly affect related supply chains. As one firm redesigns its supply chains, suppliers, third\u2010party service providers, and customers are affected as well. In some cases, new processes are needed, while in others, new suppliers must be identified and qualified.",

It provided a significant number of quality publications over the years.

Research in global trade and multi\u2010country trade agreements encompasses issues related to, for instance, the impact of tariffs, currency risk, or the toll of political instability on supplier relations. Similarly, the challenges of tapping into new regulations, labor pools, or consumer markets whenever a supply chain is relocated to a new country make for interesting research as well. Furthermore, issues related to setting up a domestic supply chain in countries other than a firm\u2019s home country are a clearly underresearched topic deserving of attention. In addition, the impact of new technologies such as blockchain, additive manufacturing, or artificial intelligence on global supply chains might equally contribute to the STF, as technology is a key source of change in today\u2019s supply chains.",

We lead off with an article by Foerstl and Franke (2020) that explores the phenomenon of cross\u2010functional teams for sourcing. While collecting the inputs of experts from various parts of the organization for strategic procurement decision making seems routine today, the authors note that a collaborative approach to procurement can be rife with conflict. The research employs a large sample of participants from a social team experiment to measure the influence of factors such as goal misalignment, political behavior, and team conflict on team sourcing behavior and team members\u2019 satisfaction. The research offers rich perspectives for fellow academics but also those challenged with making cross\u2010functional engagement live up to its potential.",

Two data collections yield different results, suggesting that emerging market footholds benefit extensively from logistics and competitive knowledge, whereas other forms of knowledge (namely, customer knowledge) become more prominent as markets mature. The analysis illustrates that logistics and other types of knowledge can be instrumental to new product launch in emerging markets.",
