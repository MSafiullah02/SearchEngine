The diagnosis and treatment of adult SHLH is challenging because the etiology of the disease is difficult to identify, and the majority of reported cases are pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to describe the etiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of adult SHLH. Fifty-four adult patients who fulfilled the criteria of SHLH were enrolled in the study. Viral etiology, blood biomarkers, and clinical manifestations of SHLH were analyzed in these patients. Twenty-four SHLH patients had viraemia, whereas 30 SHLH patients were secondary to other diseases. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was the most common virus that associated SHLH among all viruses studied. Severe SHLH patients with EBV-viraemia presented significantly high levels of ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT). Positively relationships existed between EBV DNA titers and levels of AST and ALT (P < 0.05). The prognosis of SHLH patients with EBV viraemia was worse than that of non-EBV SHLH and non-viral SHLH. Our data reveal that EBV is the major pathogen in virus-associated SHLH, and EBV load influence disease development in SHLH patients with EBV infection that prognosis is worse than other viruses associated SHLH.",

In the clinic, HLH is a rare but potentially fatal hyperinflammatory syndrome, the typical findings of which are high fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow (BM) or other organs [Henter et al., 2007] . The diagnosis of HLH in adults is challenging, not only because HLH occurs in many disease entities and results in symptoms similar to these diseases, but also because the etiology cannot be identified in many patients. The heterogeneous etiology and nonspecific clinical and laboratory findings of HLH often lead to delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis, and thus, the mortality rate resulting from this disease is quite high.",

Contrary to primary HLH, secondary HLH (SHLH) can occur at any age, which is associated with a wide spectrum of underlying conditions. [Park et al., 2012] . Infection as the main trigger of SHLH constitutes 50.4% of reported cases, which include viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections. Presently, viral infection is the most frequent trigger of SHLH, either as a primary infection in healthy people or reactivated infections in patients with immunosuppressed diseases [Ramos-Casals et al., 2014] . Viral infections may trigger SHLH by lymphocytes activation or by proinflammatory cytokines secretion. In some countries, viruses are the most common infectious agents associated with SHLH, followed by bacteria, parasites, and fungi [Tiab et al., 2000; Deane et al., 2010] . Because some subtypes of SHLH confer a higher mortality rate than those seen in primary HLH [Rouphael et al., 2007] , a thorough investigation of underlying etiology is beneficial for the proper diagnosis and timely treatment of the disease.",

The patient's clinical manifestations, disease course, and treatment response are affected not only by SHLH itself, but also by its possible underlying conditions [Park, Kim et al., 2012] . Until now, the formal guideline for evaluating patients with infection-associated SHLH has not been established [Fisman, 2000] . Although many viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpes virus 8 (HHPV8), cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza virus, hepatitis virus, and parvovirus B19 (PVB19), have been identified as triggers of SHLH [Fardet et al., 2003; Henter et al., 2006; Yilmaz et al., 2006; Rouphael, Talati et al., 2007; Titze et al., 2009; Demircioglu et al., 2013] , many previous studies were based on sporadic case reports. In EBV-associated SHLH, a high viral DNA load has been associated with poor outcomes [Rouphael, Talati et al., 2007] . Direct molecular virologic assays may help for better detection of this potentially underdiagnosed disease, although diagnosis after considering all the viruses associated with SHLH would not be practical currently.",

These included EBV; influenza virus (Flu A, FluB); parainfluenza virus types 1-4 (hPIV-1, -2, -3, and -4); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); adenovirus (ADV); coronavirus (OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1); human metapneumovirus (MPV); bocavirus (HBoV); rhinovirus (HRV); human papillomavirus (HPV); herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1); and parvovirus B19 (PVB19). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was also measured. All viruses were detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) on the plasma samples. DNA/RNA extraction and Real-time polymerase chain reaction was according to the manufacture's instructions (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany). DNA was extracted from serum using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit, and RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. The highly purified DNA was amplified using the PCR Kit (Qiagen), which includes viursspecific primers. DNA was detected by Real-time PCR using the Path-IDTM qPCR Master Mix (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA) with a program consisting of one cycle of 95\u02daC for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u02daC for 15 sec, 60\u02daC for 60 sec. RNA was detected using the AgPath-IDTM One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Ambion, Carlsbad) with a program consisting of one cycle of 45\u02daC for 10 min, 95\u02daC for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u02daC for 15 sec, 60\u02daC for 45 sec. In order to confirm the co-infection, all of them were examined using specific primers and probes. The reaction was performed in ABI 7500-Fast system (Applied Biosystems). Primers were provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong province. Purified water was used as a negative control. Viral load was expressed as number of EBV DNA copies/ml. The presence of a viral load supported the diagnosis of virus-associated SHLH.",

            "text": "EBV belongs to the group of B lymphotropic human g-herpes viruses. EBV infects more than 95% of the global population with prevalence varying by sociodemographics and region [Svahn et al., 2006] . EBV is also one of the most frequent pathogens found in infection-associated SHLH [Fox et al., 2010] . In 52-62% of reported herpes virus-infected cases of SHLH, 43% are caused by infection with EBV and 9% are caused by CMV infection [Deane, Selmi et al., 2010] . Although the predominant cause of infection-associated SHLH differs in each country because of the population's specific genetic backgrounds and differences in suspected triggering agents, the majority of virus-associated SHLH cases in Asian countries are caused by EBV infection [Imashuku 2002 ]. This phenomenon possibly due to more pathogenic EBV strains presenting in this region [Rouphael, Talati et al., 2007; Janka and Lehmberg, 2014] . Our study is consistent with these findings: not only the incidence of EBV-associated SHLH was higher than other virus-associated SHLH cases, but also EBV was main virus found in the fatal cases, moreover, mean EBV load was significantly higher in server viral SHLH patients than in non-server viral SHLH patients, indicating that EBV load could influence disease development in SHLH patients with EBV infection. EBV induced SHLH confers the worst prognosis [Rouphael, Talati et al., 2007] . EBV infects via the oropharyngeal route, and is transmitted primarily through saliva. Primary EBV infection is mostly asymptomatic, following primary infection, EBV DNA can be detected in blood (mainly in the B-lymphocyte) from most individuals, and is rapidly cleared in 1-3 weeks [Bauer et al., 2005; Zoufaly et al., 2009] . EBV establishes lifelong latency at low copy numbers (1-50 copies among 10 6 cells) in the B-cell memory compartment [Heslop 2005 ]. The incidence of potentially life-threatening complications depends on the EBV viral load, in our study, EBV viral titers was significantly higher in severe SHLH patients than in non-severe patients, moreover, patients with worse prognosis had higher EBV copies than those of good prognosis (>10 4 copies/ml vs. 10 1-2 copies/ml). Clinically, EBV DNAemia is an infectious complication following hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplantation or HIV infection, a significant proportion of patients with EBV DNAemia can be life-threatening [Ocheni et al., 2008; van Esser et al., 2001; Zoufaly, Stellbrink et al., 2009 ]. There is scarce data of EBV viraemia existing in patients with SHLH. As EBV antibody were detected in our patients, EBV reactivation is suspected to these patients. EBV reactivation is likely due to the over immunosuppression and persistent EBV infection [Bamoulid et al., 2013] .",

Because viral infection was seldom considered as the etiology for SHLH, treatment for viral infection was lacking. Thus, we cannot exclude whether the high mortality rates among patients with EBV-associated SHLH resulted from ineffective therapy though there is no effective treatment for these viral infections. We can conclude that the prognosis for severe cases of non-EBV SHLH was better than the cases of EBV-associated SHLH. Compared with EBV, other viral SHLH, including HSV-1, MPV, and hPIV-1, had better prognoses.",

A cytokine-driven condition triggered by viral replication has been postulated, and it has been speculated that hypercytokinemia impairs the normal functioning of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, NK cells, or both. In SHLH, hemophagocytosis and cytokine overproduction may result in cellular damage and multi-organ dysfunction Muralitharan et al., 2007] . Cytokine storm in SHLH is more pronounced in EBV-associated disease, causing hemophagocytosis and organ dysfunction. This might explain why the majority of fatal cases were found in EBV-associated SHLH. If SHLH were a manifestation of an overwhelming hypercytokinemia, then treatment of the infection might not have been sufficient [Han et al., 2012] .",

Thus, it is of major importance for physicians to be aware that the clinical picture of SHLH, sepsis, and MODS can share common features. These syndromes cannot be reliably discriminated by using diagnostic criteria devised for SHLH alone. Therefore, the diagnosis of SHLH must rely on other clinical, laboratory, and histopathological findings [Henter, Horne et al., 2007] . Phagocytosis of blood cells is a hallmark of SHLH [Goel et al., 2012] . During inflammation, macrophages may engulf erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, and their precursor cells, enacting a unique and evolving aspect of macrophage biology [Risma and Jordan, 2012] . In this study, hemophagocytosis was found in the BM smears of all patients, indicating that BM hemophagocytosis has a high sensitivity for diagnosing SHLH. There is significant overlap in the clinical and laboratory findings between SHLH and malignant diseases (particularly Fig. 3 . Kaplan-Meier survival curve for overall survival stratified by severe or non-severe outcome. a: survival curve between severe and non-severe SHLH patients (P < 0.01). b: show significantly different survival rate existed in patients with EBV viraemia and without EBV viraemia (P < 0.05). lymphomas or tumor metastasis), sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which makes it difficult to differentiate these patients [Castillo and Carcillo, 2009] . Under these circumstances, hemophagocytosis would help to differentially diagnose these patients, especially those who do not fulfill the criteria for SHLH and are overlooked. Among the various biomarkers available for diagnosing SHLH, the presence of hemophagocytosis is what most practitioners continuing to rely on to timely and differentially diagnose the patients [Gupta et al., 2008] . Hemophagocytosis is triggered specifically by interferon gamma (IFN-g) , and the direct action of IFN-gon macrophages leads to the development of severe consumptive anemia and cytopenia [Zoller et al., 2011] . Indeed, unexplained acute cytopenia is commonly observed and has been associated with worse outcomes in critically ill patients [Risma and Jordan 2012] . Although hemophagocytosis has high sensitivity for differential diagnosis, it has been observed that patients' prognosis is various, even when the same hemophagocytosis is observed in BM [Gupta et al., 2008] . Serum ferritin is a biomarker of a final common pathway of systemic inflammatory response, and hyperferritinemia is frequently used as a marker of SHLH severity. In our study, higher levels of ferritin, LDH, AST, and ALT were found in the severe SHLH group compared with the nonsevere SHLH group, indicating that ferritin, LDH, AST, and ALT are all sensitive biomarkers that reflect disease severity for SHLH.",
