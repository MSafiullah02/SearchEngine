Viral infections were diagnosed by either immunological (monoclonal antibodies) or molecular (RT-PCR) methods. Each of two sets of primer pairs developed for detection of all CoVs (panCoV) failed to detect 15 of the 53 (28.3%) hCoV strains identified. On the other hand, all hCoV strains could be detected by using typespecific primers targeting genes 1ab and N. The HuH-7 cell line was found to be susceptible to isolation and identification of OC43-and 229E-like strains. Overall, hCoV infection was caused by OC43-like, 229E-like, and NL63-like strains in 25 (53.2%), 10 (21.3%), and 9 (19.1%) patients, respectively. In addition, three patients (6.4%) were infected by untypeable hCoV strains. NL63-like strains were not found to circulate in 2003-2004, and 229E-like strains did not circulate in 2004-2005, while OC43-like strains were detected in both seasons. The monthly distribution reached a peak during January through March. Lower predominated over upper respiratory tract infections in each age group. In addition, hCoV infections interested only immunocompetent infants and young children during the first year of life, while all adults were immunocompromised patients. Coinfections of hCoVs and other respiratory viruses (mostly interesting the first year of life) were observed in 14 of the 47 (29.8%) patients and were associated with severe respiratory syndromes more frequently than hCoV single infections (P \u00bc 0.002). In conclusion, the use of multiple primer sets targeting different genes is recommended for diagnosis of all types of hCoV infection. In addition, the detection of still untypeable hCoV strains suggests that the number of hCoVs involved in human pathology might further increase. Finally, hCoVs should be screened routinely for in both infants and immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory infection.",

Initially, several other hCoVs were described, such as B814 [Tyrrell and Bynoe, 1965] , hCoV-OC16, hCoV-OC37, and hCoV-OC48 [McIntosh et al., 1967] . However, these viruses could not be grown in tissue culture or animal models. Attempts to identify hCoVs in clinical specimens or cell cultures by using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies were not satisfactory [McIntosh et al., 1978; Sizun et al., 1998 ].",

Recently, two groups of researchers from The Netherlands [Fouchier et al., 2004; van der Hoek et al., 2004] and one group from USA [Esper et al., 2005] reported a new hCoV, referred to as NL63 and New Haven, respectively. This virus was related distantly to hCoV-229E, and described as one viral agent associated with acute respiratory disease in hospitalized children. Furthermore, another hCoV (referred to as HKU1), distantly related to hCoV-OC43, was detected in two Hong-Kong patients with pneumonia [Woo et al., 2005a] , and then reported elsewhere [Woo et al., 2005b; Sloots et al., 2006; Vabret et al., 2006] . A similar virus was also reported in Sweden by molecular screening of respiratory tract samples [Allander et al., 2005] . Finally, a few studies have addressed the circulation of hCoVs with respect to other respiratory viruses in different countries, as well as their involvement in respiratory syndromes other than the common cold, and their association with asthma and chronic obstructive bronchopneumopathies, including hCoV pneumonia in transplanted patients [Lina et al., 1996; Folz and Elkordy, 1999; El-Sahly et al., 2000; Falsey et al., 2002] .",

In the >21-year group 108 were solid organ transplant recipients, 46 stem cell transplant recipients, and two AIDS patients. Specimens were handled and aliquoted as reported previously , and used for immunological (monoclonal antibodies) and molecular (RT-PCR) assays, as well as for short-term and long-term virus isolation in cell culture. Respiratory samples were examined routinely for influenzaviruses A and B, parainfluenzaviruses 1-4, human respiratory syncytial virus, and human adenoviruses by both direct fluorescent staining and culture. In addition, human metapneumoviruses were examined by both monoclonal antibodies and RT-PCR as recently reported Gerna et al., 2006] .

Viral sequences of the amplified fragments of genes 1ab and N of different hCoV strains as well as reference strains were aligned with the Clustal W program version 1.7. Distances between pairs of nucleotide sequences were calculated by using the DNAdist modules (with Kimura's twoparameter method) in the Phylip package, version 3.572 (Felsenstein, Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The Phylip (njplot) program was used to construct phylogenetic trees with nucleotide sequences by means of the neighbor-joining method from the same distance matrices. Bootstrap support was determined by 100 resamplings of the sequences.",

Of the 53 hCoV-positive samples, 23 (43.4%) were found positive by both assays, while 15 (28.3%) were detected by panCoV-03 only, and 15 (28.3%) by panCoV-05 only (Fig. 1B,C) .

In addition, the development of viral genome amplification procedures has provided a major contribution to the identification of hCoV infections. A major variant of group I hCoVs, with the 229E virus as a prototype, was identified in the NL63 strain detected in the Netherlands [Fouchier et al., 2004; Van der Hoek et al., 2004] , and in the USA [Esper et al., 2005] . More recently, a major variant of group II hCoVs, with the OC43 virus as a prototype, was first reported in Hong-Kong as HKU1 [Woo et al., 2005a] and, then, in France, Australia, and other regions of China [Woo et al., 2005b; Sloots et al., 2006; Vabret et al., 2006] . A wide range of antigenic variability has been reported by researchers recovering a series of viruses in organ cultures of human embryonic trachea [McIntosh et al., 1967; McIntosh, 2005] . However, a great deal of controversy has been raised about the genetic stability [St-Jean et al., 2004] or variability of hCoV OC43-like strains.",

A similar conclusion was recently reported by another study [Chiu et al., 2005] . As a result, in order to detect the maximal number of circulating hCoVs, specific primers should be used, and results confirmed by a second set of primers, preferably targeting a different gene. In the present study, no HKU1 strain was detected by the two PanCoV primer sets used, while, in the absence of a positive control, HKU1-specific primers were not used.",

This cell line, which was shown to be susceptible to infection by a murine coronavirus, the mouse hepatitis virus [Koetters et al., 1999] , has been found to be helpful in increasing the rate of respiratory virus recovery from DFA-negative samples .

A major morphological characteristic of both 229E-like and OC43-like strains was the presence of syncytial formations in inoculated cell cultures, appearing early (24-48 hr) after inoculation and progressively enlarging until detaching from the cell surface. In this respect, it seems important to recall that SARS-hCoV was reported to produce syncytia in vivo [Ksiazek et al., 2003] . As for NL63-like strains, initial growth was confirmed by the positive RT-PCR results in the supernatant of all three types of cell cultures inoculated with four NL63-positive respiratory samples, that is, two cell lines (LLC-MK2 and Vero) and one secondary culture of African green monkey kidney. However, at subsequent passages, the presence of the viral RNA signal in the medium weakened progressively and finally disappeared. Since inoculated NL63-like-positive samples were freezethawed more than once prior to inoculation, new isolation attempts will be made as soon as fresh positive specimens become available.",

It is important to emphasize that all infected infants and young children were immunocompetent subjects. These results strengthen previous observations on the great pathologic potential of hCoVs in very young patients [McIntosh et al., 1974; Sizun et al., 1995; El-Sahly et al., 2000; Vabret et al., 2003; Chiu et al., 2005] . In addition to 229E-and OC43like strains, also the newly identified NL63-like strains were shown to be associated with lower respiratory tract infections, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia [Arden et al., 2005; Bastien et al., 2005; Ebihara et al., 2005; Esper et al., 2005; Vabret et al., 2005] .
