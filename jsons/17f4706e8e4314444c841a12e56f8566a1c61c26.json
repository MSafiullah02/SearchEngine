Ball Valve #7 (\"AT\") should be completely closed (Figure 2; Figure S2E ; this is the Accessory Tap Filler valve for the attached blue hose, see below). 7. Spring loaded \"quick connect\" drain valve #3 should be closed (Figures 2, 3L; Figure S2C , e.g., with nothing attached!) This is the main drain valve. This male valve automatically opens when the female connector is attached, see below. 8. Individual ball valves to each row of tanks (rows lettered A-F, from top to bottom) should be adjusted as needed: typically, \u00bd open (45\u00b0 position). If there are no tanks on these rows they should be closed (Figure 2; Figure S2F ). 9. Individual tank ball valves should be opened as needed (Figures 1D, 2; Figure S2G ). Typically, these should be completely closed if there are no tanks or open fully or less, as needed. Typically, these are set to \u00bd open (45\u00b0) for the 3 l tanks and both are set completely open for each of the 10 l tanks.",

This is achieved by a motorized ball valve (Figures 2, 5I; Figure S2H ). The bypass valve is regulated by relay R3. When the relay is open, the system is in filtering mode. When the relay is closed, the system is in feeding mode. Normally, the state of relay R3 is controlled by a digital input from the feeding system (D5). A small window on the bypass valve \"BP\" indicates its current status ( Figure S2H ). If the window is black, the unit is in filtering mode. If the window is white (side of stem colored with white paint), the unit is in feeding mode. When the valve is in the feeding position, Alarm light A3 will be illuminated. During the feeding mode, sea water will not pass through the filters due to the presence of a reverse flow check valve (Figures 2, 3L) . Water flow will thus encounter less resistance due to the removal of the filters and no water will return to the sump via the small bioreactor filter loop. Therefore, during feedings the effluent, outlet pressure indicated on the round gauge will rise approximately 3psi (e.g., with a new pleated filter from approx. 10-13 PSI to 13-16 PSI; Figure 2 ; Figure S2B ). The flow rate to the tanks will also increase somewhat during feeding from by approximately 3 lpm (e.g., with a new pleated filter from 29-30 l/min to about 32-33 l/min, or possibly as high as 34l/min). (Note that the level of water in the sump will be lowered by about 0.5 to 1 cm during feeding). The noise level of water flowing through the main pump will generally increase during feeding. This is normal, but one should pay attention for any signs of cavitation (see below). The only bypass water that will return to the sump during feeding will come back via the sensor loop, unless the main bypass loop (valve #5, Figures 2, 4N-O; Figure S2D ) has been opened somewhat. Note that depending on the flow rate, some bypass water must return back to the sump or cavitation may occur (see below). The UV lamp will continue to operate during feeding, as it requires flowing sea water to cool it (otherwise the PVC housing would melt!; Figure 3I ). During feeding the skimmer is also turned off (Figures 3C-F, 5G-H) . When the filters are turned back on after feeding, there may be a slight delay in the formation of new skimmate by the protein skimmer (though we have not yet encountered any such problems). There is normally no need to make any system adjustments during feeding.",

            "text": "Note that as the filters become clogged, the effluent outlet water pressure will drop (as will the overall flow rate). Pressure on the intake side of the filters will increase while that on the outflow side will decrease (the latter being the pressure read by the small round gauge; Figure  2 ; Figure S2B ). This gauge can be used as an indicator for potential problems or when it is time to replace the pleated 50\u00b5m filter ( Figure 3G ; Figure S2B ), though the reading is somewhat misleading. For instance, if one opens up the valves supplying the small tanks this pressure reading will drop and the flow rate will increase. Typically, filter replacement is required when the inlet and outlet pressure difference is 10psi. Once the pressure difference gets above that, there is a small risk that the filter cartridge can collapse/crush. In our system there is no second gauge that reads inlet water pressure to the filters, so the pressure difference cannot be determined. Most labs care more about the flow rate to the tanks than the pressure in the filters. There is a direct relationship between flow and pressure with pumps, so it's easier to just change the filter according to changes in flow rate. As the filters become clogged you will also notice that the noise level of the system will become quieter, as less splashing water returns to the sump. It is recommended to change the filter once the system's filtered flow rate drops to no lower than 20 lpm, but one can change the filter before that point. One can gain some additional time before needing to perform a filter change by simply opening up the valves that supply sea water to the manifolds for each row of tanks (valves A-F). This will also impact the flow occurring during feedings, which will also be elevated (one should limit the maximum flow during feeding to around 35-36 lpm). At some point though, the effluent water pressure will drop to low and the float switch will not rise, triggering a no-flow alarm. At that point the filter must be changed immediately, as this will begin to impact the reading of temperature, conductivity and pH, which may lead to lethal changes, as the system tries to compensate for the false readings! While in some other applications it may be possible to clean clogged filters, in our case the biofilm, finer debris and algae trapped by the filter material are much harder to remove simply by washing the filter, and, thus, the filters must be replaced. Furthermore, the material that is trapped by the filter will continue to break down within the system, so the longer the waste/food stays in the system, the more organics/nitrogenous waste will accumulate in the water. Filtering flow rates with new filters are around 29-30 lpm, and effluent pressures should return to around 10-12psi (32-34 LPM and 13-15psi during feeding).",

Their purpose is to prevent animals from reaching the rear drain tube where they could travel to other parts of the system. In this system we use baffles with 400\u00b5m openings, which are small enough to prevent Crepidula atrasolea embryos or juvenile snails from escaping the tanks. Each tank is equipped with a plastic lid ( Figure 1E ). Unused holes in these lids are plugged with small white plastic snap caps to help limit evaporation and water spray ( Figure 1G ; McMaster Carr, part number 9688K25162PP050BG14, Elmhurst, IL).

Lift the tanks straight up to clear the drain tube from the drain cover ( Figure 1H-J) , and the ridges on the bottom of the tank, which straddle the rack cross bars (Figure 1E, G) . When done, reinstall tank and/or lid in reverse order, insert the tubing and then turn the tank valve(s) back on. It's easy to forget this last step.

Make sure the reservoir lids are correctly installed and the filler intake/vent tubes are in place! The filler tube has a cylindrical weight to keep it submerged. For the pH reservoir one can mix dH 2 O with Na-bicarbonate (dissolved to about one half of its saturation point, or 40gm/liter) and Kalkwasser (Ca-hydroxide, dissolved to about half its saturation point, Bulk Reef Supply, Golden Valley, MN). Note, however, that we have not been using the pH pump, and have inactivated this by placing it in HOA off mode (see additional note, below). Rather, we adjust pH manually, as needed. On rare occasions, during the initial establishment of this system, the pH dropped by 0.1 unit. To correct this we added 5gm of Marine Buffer (Seachem, Madison, GA) per 40 gallons of sea water. This elevated the pH by 0.1 unit. More recently, we saw a slight elevation of pH. To correct this issue, we performed a series of partial water changes and began to supplement ionic calcium (see Section 11: Monitoring Water Quality, below).",

Normally, these small red and blue electromagnetic relay pumps, mounted on the back wall to the right side of our rack system, make a distinct rhythmic sound during pumping ( Figure 4F ). When the pumps are running dry and pumping air they will make a much louder popping sound. This is not good for the pumps and is caused by fluid level in the reservoirs being located below the weighted inlets of the supply/vent tubing, or the pump(s) may need to be re-primed. Priming is accomplished by opening the small round plastic valves on the very top of the pumps ( Figure  4F , see the manufacturer's instruction manual). Make sure there is enough liquid in the reservoirs. Allow the pumps to run by placing them in HOA \"On\" mode using the main system control panel. The pumps are primed when fluid starts to exit the vent tubes that hang back down into the reservoirs. At this point the small valves should be closed to allow the fluid to pump to the sump instead. Be sure to verify that this is working! After the problem is corrected return the pump control to HOA \"Auto\" mode using the main system control panel. RO pumping rate is set to 40 pulses per min. This must be set on the front panel of the RO and pH pumps themselves (Figure 4F ; follow the manufacturer's instructions, Iwaki Co. Ltd., Holliston, MA). Adjustments can only be made in the upward direction, so if you miss your desired setting you must go all the way up and back to zero to reset the proper value. These values are typically set to be \"locked\" on the RO and pH pump control faces so that one cannot accidentally change these (users are referred to the pump manufacturer's manual for full operation). Pumping rates may be changed, if needed. For example, if the restored levels tend overshoot those desired, then the pumping rate can be lowered (e.g., conductivity overshoots and goes too low, triggering an alarm, during RO water pumping). With lower pumping rates the pump will tend to run longer but the water will have a better chance of mixing so values will be able to stabilize , which helps limit false readings made by the sensors. **So far, we have not seen any need for the pH dosing pump. pH levels appear to be holding fairly steady; though earlier we had noticed these values slowly drop once we added animals and began to feed them, and more recently (after eight months of operation) we saw a slight elevation in pH (see Section 11: Monitoring Water Quality). We are considering a change to the use the pH pump to deliver periodic, scheduled doses of Ca++ to the system to enhance shell growth. (Figures 2, 3A) :",

            "text": "The sump contains a compact Tunze protein skimmer (Tunze Comline DOC Skimmer, 9004 DC, Penzberg, Germany) that fits inside the left compartment of the sump on the far left side (Figures 2, 3C-F) . Protein skimmer status is indicated by Alarm light A7. It is illuminated whenever the skimmer is turned off, which occurs during a feeding cycle. The protein skimmer is located in the sump and runs automatically when the filters are active, but is turned off during feeding via a custom microcontroller circuit (Figure 5G-H; see Additional File 15, Additional File 16, Additional File 17, and Additional File 18). Normally, a low level output (0) from pin 3 of the Tunze motor controller's ATMEL 1724 microcontroller turns on the 12 volt DC motor, and a high level output (1) stops the motor. This is the output that is being intercepted by the accessory microcontroller interface, under control of a signal sent by the Walchem 900 controller, when it receives the over-riding command from the feeding station's microcontroller. In other words, when it is time for feeding, the feeding station sends a signal to the Walchem 900 controller to activate the bypass valve (see below). The Walchem 900 controller then sends a signal to the accessory skimmer control circuit which, in turn, interrupts the output of the DC motor controller's own microcontroller to turn off the skimmer. Note that the blue skimmer control power light (located inside the skimmer control box knob) will stay illuminated even during feeding ( Figure 5G ). One can override skimmer function and turn off the skimmer at any time for a preset period (approx. 10 mins) by pushing the small button on the small skimmer control box ( Figure 5G , the blue light will then go off). The skimmer can be turned back on by pushing the button again or it will automatically turn on after the preset time interval. The speed of the skimmer DC motor is regulated by the illuminated knob on the control box ( Figure 5G) . Typically, this only needs to be set to the 30-50% position, as needed. If this is adjusted too high, excess sea water will enter the skimmer cup. If this is set too low, no skimmate will be formed. This needs to be adjusted empirically. Skimmate needs to be removed from the collection cup ( Figure 3D-G) , and its rate of formation depends on several factors, including the size and amount of bubbles and the concentration of dissolved organics. As supplied, the removable Tunze skimmer collecting cup does not have a drain tube. We have installed a silicone drain tube that exits the sump on the left side through a bulkhead compression fitting located just above the high water line on the far left side of the sump (Figure 3D , F; silicone tubing: 0.188\" ID x 0.375\" OD, Dow Corning, Midland, MI). Be careful with the skimmer's silicone drain tube. If it becomes disconnected from the small collecting cup the skimmate will simply flow back into the sump. If it gets kinked and collapses inside the sump bulkhead connector, a leak may form. This tubing can be fed to an external tray to collect the skimmate ( Figure 3G) . Note, however, that sea water can enter the collecting cup, as described above (and also see note below), and this would drain out of the tubing to the bucket. A great deal of water could flow through this tubing, which is located just at or slightly below the highwater level in the sump! This could create a huge mess, though we have never encountered such a problem. Alternatively, the open end of the tubing can be elevated well above the water level in the sump and lowered to drain the skimmer cup, as needed. Periodically (once every week or so) one should wipe clean the inside of the skimmer collection cup, its airlift (chimney) and the lid, which will accumulate a great deal of algae and other proteins. More skimmate will form if one keeps the chimney clean ( Figure 3E ). The skimmer is normally controlled by relay (R7). When relay R7 output is low/off (0) the skimmer will run and when relay R7 is high/on (1) the skimmer will stop.",

Activated carbon is a porous substance with a very high capacity for absorbing organic materials. The carbon pellets can also serve as a substrate for nitrifying bacteria. The activated carbon (Kent Reef Carbon, Kent Marine, Franklin, WI) should be replaced, as needed. This filter cartridge holds a considerable amount of activated carbon (about two pounds) and should last for a year or more. This is far more carbon than is needed and some recommend using far less or even no carbon at all. Unfortunately, there is no good way to tell when this filter is depleted. If the sea water should turn yellow, it might be time to change the activated carbon. Note that there is a small 3\" diameter sponge-like filter inside the activated carbon canister to help retain the pellets, and this should be rinsed and reused if the media is changed. We recommend changing the activated carbon every one to three years. Only half of the carbon should be changed. When replacing the activated carbon, one needs to thoroughly rinse the new carbon in dH 2 O to remove fine particulates. A mesh bag is provided for this purpose; however, one can also rinse the carbon directly in the cartridge using a large plastic bucket (only if all the carbon is being changed). One concern is that the activated carbon may impact the pH of the system. This issue seems to depend on the source of the carbon. One should monitor this carefully. Activated carbon may also remove certain trace elements from the sea water. Commercial preparations may be used to add back trace elements. If used, they should be added when the filters are in bypass (feeding) mode. Activated carbon may also release phosphates into the sea water, which is not desired. The activated carbon also acts as an additional biological filter, providing substrate for bacteria.

A relatively small amount of water is slowly diverted to this side loop via the needle valve (#6; Figures 2, 3L, Figure S2C ). Needle valve #6 should be opened enough to keep side filter loop PHA pellets moving gently. (Turning this valve clockwise will close it). Never over-tighten this valve as that may damage the needle. The PHA pellets (Vertex Aquaristik Pro-Bio Pellets, Huntington Beach, CA) must be kept moving to dislodge the accumulating bacterial byproducts in which the nitrogen is being sequestered, and to prevent the pellets from sticking together. These PHA pellets contain a source of carbon needed by the bacteria to remove the nitrates. It is best to keep the bio-reactor in a dark area away from light to prevent algal growth (we cover this canister with dark, opaque material). These nitrogen rich by-products need to be removed from the water using the protein skimmer. Ideally, the water from the side loop should be returned directly back to the sump, near to the protein skimmer's intake. To service the bio-reactor, place the system into standby mode or shut off the flow of water to the side loop (close valve #6).",

One can place a small 1/2\" long yellow Teflon coated magnet (i.e., stir bar) inside the bio-reactor filter cartridge along with the PHA pellets. One can then use another strong rare-earth magnet, which is held externally by the hand, to move this stir bar and dislodge any stuck pellets without having to shut off water flow or open the filter. Alternatively, if the pellets refuse to move one should open the filter. To accomplish this, shut off water flow to the side reactor (Valve #6), bleed in some air by pushing the purge valve located on top of the filter holder, and then remove the filter bowl. As long as valve #6 is fully closed, it should not be necessary to shut off the main pump, or place the system into standby mode, to perform this service (One should verify that no water is returning back to the sump via the return hose connected to this filter, though it is perhaps safer to place the system in standby mode). Note that if the pump is running, some signs of cavitation may be detected. In that case, simply open up the main bypass loop just a little bit until cavitation stops (Valve #5). Note that the bio-reactor is located in a rather confined space next to the main pump, so be careful not to spill sea water when removing the cartridge bowl. Once the bowl has been unscrewed, it must be tilted to remove it; therefore, some water should first be removed using a large pipette to prevent spilling. Be careful, the main pump motor with its electrical connection is located adjacent to the bioreactor! Once enough water has been removed you can carefully tilt and lift out the filter bowl without spilling the remaining sea water. (By following this procedure, one should not have to remove the carbon filter to remove the bioreactor filter.) Once the bowl is removed, you will notice that the inner cartridge has a round cap and a slotted filter screen to prevent debris and pellets from leaving the filter, and these must be cleaned. Make note of their correct orientation for proper reassembly. Pull out the cartridge slowly and then slowly poor off some sea water remaining in the bowl and save this. The cartridge can then be placed back in the bowl, and vigorously moved repeatedly up and down inside the sea water remaining in the filter bowl to dislodge the bacterial film. One can also use the long plastic pipette to vigorously stir the pellets. Remove the inner cartridge from the bowl with the pellets and discard the dirty sea water left in the filter bowl. Repeat this wash one more time with some more of the clean sea water. Only clean the little round slotted screen in the sink using distilled water and wipe clean using paper towels. Do not rinse the cartridge, bowl or pellets with anything other than sea water, so as not to destroy the bacteria! Reassemble the various part of the filter in the reverse order and screw the bowl back in place. Once the filter is replaced, restore water flow to the bio-reactor side loop (open valve #6 just enough to get the pellets moving). If they are not cleaned sufficiently, fragments of biofilm may continue to come off the pellets and be drawn into the slotted plastic filter screen, which could impede water flow, and this would need to be re-cleaned. Note, to get all the flowing sea water back into the bio-reactor's filter bowl, the purge valve needs to be pressed to remove the air (you may hear a little hiss as the air escapes). Stop pressing this button once all the air is gone and a little water starts to leak out of the purge valve. Be sure to return the main bypass valve #5 back to its previous setting when done servicing the bio-reactor. Some additional sea water will need to be added back to the system to replace that discarded during cleaning. It is a good practice to keep an eye on the bio-reactor and to periodically dislodge or clean these pellets.",

In the recirculating system, the combination of reduced volume of crushed coral ( Figure 4M ) and a rapidly growing snail population reduced calcium levels, in turn increasing water hardness (KH) and pH. To address immediate concerns (after 8 months in service), we performed a series of partial water changes (maximum 20% of water volume at one time). Over the longer term, we have initiated the use of an ionic calcium supplement, to increase calcium levels without affecting pH or carbonate levels. We use Reef Advantage Calcium (Seachem Laboratories, Madison, GA) to maintain calcium levels at 380-420 ppm and balance water hardness and pH, following the manufacturer's recommendations. Calcium chloride should be added slowly to the system, per the manufacturer's instructions, as excess doses can affect carbonate alkalinity and pH.

Power to the UV lamp is controlled by relay (R2). Turn Off the system to avoid electrical shock! The UV light helps sanitize the water by killing circulating microorganisms. The sanitizing efficiency of UV light is related to UV intensity and water flow rate (e.g., UV exposure amount/time). UV output diminishes with use, and therefore, the UV bulb has a limited lifespan and should be replaced once each year. In addition, the quartz sleeve that protects the UV bulb must also be inspected and cleaned if deposits have formed, whenever the bulb is changed. UV operating status is indicated by Alarm light A2. UV bulb illumination can also be verified by the presence of a pink/blue light seen through the transparent blue plastic bell located at the top of the bulb housing ( Figure 3I ). The UV bulb is 57 watts and is designed to have a 95% efficiency at the end of its 1 year rated lifespan (9000hrs; equal to 110\u00b5W/cm 2 ). At that time the quartz sleeve should also be inspected and cleaned, as needed. These parts are to be removed separately, starting with the UV bulb. First the system should be turned off and unplugged. The water should be allowed to drain back to the sump and main outlet valve #1 and sensor loop valve #2 should be closed (Figure 2; Figure S2B ). The UV bulb may be removed alone without opening up the quartz sleeve sea water compartment by loosening the black nut located just above transparent blue plastic bell ( Figure 3I) . Only handle the UV lamp and quartz sleeve with clean gloves. Once loose, the bulb will slide straight up out of the holder along with its electrical connections. After the UV bulb is removed one can also remove the quartz sleeve by loosening the transparent plastic blue bell ( Figure 3I ). Once loose, the sleeve, which looks like a giant test tube, will slide straight up out of the holder. Note that unlike the UV bulb, the outer surface of the quartz sleeve is exposed directly to the sea water. The quartz sleeve may be dried and wiped clean using cotton wipes or cheese cloth. If scaled, some mild vinegar may be used to dissolve the calcium deposits located on the outside of the sleeve only! Rinse the outside with distilled water when done. Do not let any liquid enter the quartz sleeve or contact the UV bulb or its electrical connections! They must remain completely dry. The bulb and sleeve are very fragile. Great care must be taken so that they are not scratched or broken. The bottom, closed end of the quartz sleeve is particularly fragile.

Heater status is indicated by Alarm light A6 (active when illuminated). As supplied, our aquarium system has no active cooling, and the only controlled input is from this heater, which can only be used to raise the water temperature. (However, see additional external chiller, below). The activity of the heater (R6) is regulated by readings on the temperature probe located within the pH probe (S14). (Alternatively, it can be set to be regulated by the temperature probe located within the conductivity sensor (S13)). In addition, the main pump and the UV lamp provide a constant source of heat. To some extent, aquarium system temperature is related to room temperature. As room temperature rises, so can the water temperature. Room temperatures must, therefore, be kept low for maintaining tropical animals. Ideally, the room temperature should be 18-22\u00b0C. While the inclusion of covers on the tanks and the sump will limit evaporation, they will also trap heat and limit the rate of cooling. Therefore, without a chiller, or a cold room temperature, it is not possible to completely seal the aquarium system from evaporation, as it will begin to overheat. Ideally, aquarium water temperature should be maintained at 27\u00b0C for Crepidula atrasolea snails. Note that the readings on the main system controller may not accurately reflect those inside the individual tanks. Temperatures should be verified using a reliable thermometer. Snails can tolerate a temperature range of 23-29\u00b0C, but the extreme temperatures put a great deal of stress on the animals and will kill them. Alternatively, one can use a small aquarium chiller to lower temperatures, as needed (see below).",

The best configuration is to have the chiller installed during production, with the chiller loop located directly inside the sump and regulated by a common temperature control circuit used for the heater. Alternatively, one can tap off of the system to divert some pressurized water to a small chiller, as described below (Figures 2, 4C , K-L; Figure S2B ). Please note that chillers will also generate their own heat, which can elevate room temperature even further. The water chiller does not need to be used at all times (see below), but is a permanent installation to the system. Chillers require a specified flow of sea water typically of at least 3 gallons/min. The chiller must also be rated to handle at least 25 PSI of inlet water pressure, which is the maximum rated output pressure of the water pump, though in practice water pressure to the chiller will be much lower. One may may need to use a pressure regulator to lower the input pressure to the chiller, and reduce the flow rate to one specified for the chiller. As we supply water to an external chiller via the sensor side loop, there is little concern, as pressures there are much lower. Input water to the chiller can also come from the Acc. Tap filler hose (Figure 2; Figure S2E ), which can deliver greater pressures and flow rates (controlled by valve 7). The chilled water needs to be returned directly back to the sump (Figures 2, 4N) , and those lines should be enclosed with foam insulated tubing secured with zip ties (Figure 4K-L) .",

The chiller is a simple flow-thru system and does not have an internal pump. Therefore, one must feed the chiller with pressured water from the rack system. To accomplish this, the chiller receives the effluent sea water from the sensor side loop (Figures 2, 4C , K-L; see Additional File 3E), which ranges between 10-14 psi or lower as the pleated filters become clogged. Note that this particular chiller does not require a pressure regulator, as the pressures are below the maximum rated safe pressures. The chilled water is returned directly back to the sump using the side loop's final effluent tubing connection located directly in the sump cover (Figures 2, 4N) . The chiller will maintain cold water temperatures to within 1\u00b0F of its set point. Note that unlike the rack system, the chiller readings/settings are in \u00b0F. It is important to set the chiller to a temperature above that normally desired for the system (i.e., the heater temperature setting), so that the chiller and heater do not end up competing against one another. For example, if the desired system (heater) temperature is set to 27\u00b0C (80\u00b0F), then the chiller should be set to 28-29\u00b0C (82-83\u00b0F). This ensures that it only turns on when the sea water temperature well exceeds that of the desired heater temperature, and does not chill the water below that of the normally desired heater water temperature (which would in turn re-activate the heater, ad infinitum). The actual setting of the chiller must be determined empirically. We have the chiller set to 82\u00b0F which will be activated at that temperature and will turn off once the water reaches 81\u00b0F. For accuracy, the chiller's displayed temperature reading must initially be calibrated, as described by the manufacturer (Figure 4K) . The chiller is essentially a permanent installation and can be left on at all times. It will only be activated when the water temperature rises above the chiller's set point. Alternatively, the chiller power can be turned off (un-plugged), if warm room/water temperatures are not expected. Sea water will simply flow unimpeded through the chiller's plumbing system. The chiller water flow and hose connections should be inspected periodically and back-flushed, as recommended by the manufacturer.",

Currently, with the chiller installed, far less than ten gallons per minute flow through the chiller and side loop when in feeding mode (and even less when in filtering mode). The chiller actually specifies a 960 liters per hour, maximum flow rate (16 liters per min). While system flow rates range from 20-33 liters per minute (depending on the mode and condition of the filters), the flow through the sensor side loop is much less and will not exceed the chiller's specifications. If the flow rate is too slow, however, it could cause the sea water to freeze, blocking flow to the chiller and sensor side loop (sensed by the float valve; Figures 2, 4C) , which would activate a system alarm. The chiller has built in protection to sense when the coils become too cold, which will shut down the chiller (but not the aquarium system). As a safety precaution, the sensor side loop float switch could be wired to control power to the chiller, such that if water flow is interrupted, the chiller could be powered down using an accessory circuit. There is an unused relay within the Walchem 900 controller that can be used for this purpose (R8). Note that if water flow is interrupted to the sensor side loop, those sensor readings will begin to change dramatically. This will have an impact on the regulation of temperature, conductivity and pH, which could harm the animals. Alternatively, one could add the appropriate fittings to supply water to the chiller by using the accessory filler tap (valve # 7; Figure 2 ; Figure S2E) ; however, this would rob the tanks of some water flow. In this case one would also need to install a new drain port in the top of the sump cover to return the chilled water back to the sump.",

Shutting off the side loop water flow alone will not place the system in a standby mode, as the main pump will continue to run, but the flow switch (D3) will immediately register a \"No flow\" alarm. Pressure on the effluent water gauge will rise 2-3 psi. Alternatively, one can put the system in standby mode, which will shut down all water flow, and both the flow sensor (D3) and the paddle wheel flow sensor will immediately register \"No Flow\" alarms. Note that during re-calibration, various alarms may be thrown, as the sensors in the side loop will respond to changes in water conditions. This is due to the fact that when water flow is shut off to the sensor loop, the readings for temperature will begin to fluctuate and those for conductivity and pH will tend to drop over time. In addition, when the system is placed in standby mode the water level in the sump will rise by a few cm, as water drains back from the tanks, which may trigger a high water level alarm. However, while performing the actual sensor calibrations when inside the Walchem 900 controller's menu driven system, alarms and any automatic adjustments of water conditions will be temporarily suspended. Afterwards, be sure to restore flow to the side loop gradually by slowly turning back on valve (#2). If the flow switch does not rise back upwards to signify flow, the no flow alarm will remain active. In that case, one can simply turn of the valve (#2) and turn it back on more quickly. As long as the flow switch is lifted, the sensor loop is getting enough water flow. (In addition, be sure to Restore power to the chiller).",

It may take some time for these readings to stabilize and return to normal after water flow is restored (one to two days), so one should monitor the system very closely until they are stable. It may be necessary to temporarily place the RO and pH pumps in HOA OFF mode, until the readings have stabilized so that they do not change the desired parameters (see below). Figure 4C ; Figure S4B -D): The system is equipped with a Walchem pH sensor (Figures 2, 3C; Figure S4B ; model number WEL series 191653-20, Iwaki Aquatics, Holliston, MA). The pH probe must be calibrated periodically, as needed, and whenever it is replaced (once each year). This is accomplished by entering the calibration menu on the Walchem 900 main system controller. Follow the instructions. The probe must be removed for this process. Calibration is exactly like that of a standard lab pH meter. The sensor is removed by loosening the large grey plastic union using ones hands or a filter wrench ( Figure 4C; Figures S1, S4B-C) . A two-point calibration is performed using both pH 7.0 and 10.0 calibration solutions (Walchem part number 51370, pH 7.00 and Walchem part number 51371, pH 10.00, Iwaki Aquatics, Holliston, MA; Figure S4D ). These calibration solutions have a limited shelf life. Be sure to rinse and dry the probe thoroughly between solutions and before reinserting it back into the sensor loop. Follow the Walchem 900 on-screen instructions. The pH probe plugs into the pH probe preamp. While the probe itself is exposed to sea water, under no circumstances can any water contact the internal preamp connections! The probe simply plugs into the upper preamp. Therefore, the pH probe must be thoroughly dried if one is replacing the pH probe element. When reinstalling the probe, turn it so that both the thin metal temperature sensor and the larger pH probe are both exposed to the cross direction of flowing water (see Figure S4C ). Retighten the PVC union to prevent leaks! Do not over-tighten this fitting. Note that unlike the conductivity sensor, the pH probe should be replaced every year. Actual system pH should be 8.3, but one may find the system readings to be off somewhat. Actual pH should be verified independently using a second device. The output pH pump set point for regulating pH level (if activated) should be adjusted accordingly to achieve the actual desired pH. Note, however, that we have not been using the pH dosing pump to regulate pH, as this was found to be unnecessary. Figure 4C ; Figure S4B , E):",

This sensor has a range of 0-300,000 \u00b5S, with a resolution of 10\u00b5S, but is designed specifically to monitor higher salinities (Iwaki Aquatics, Holliston, MA). The conductivity sensor must be calibrated periodically and when it is replaced. The probe must be removed for this process. Calibration is accomplished by entering the calibration menu on the main system controller. The long, thin stainless steel sensor is removed by loosening the upper-most black plastic compression nut ( Figure 4C, Figure S4E ). Two adjustable wrenches are needed to ensure that the lower black plastic fitting does not come loose ( Figure S4E ). To calibrate, enter the calibration menu on the main system controller. Follow the Walchem 900 on-screen instructions for calibration. A single calibration solution (Part number YSI 3167, 060907, YSI, Inc. Yellow Springs, OH) is used with a conductivity of 1000\u00b5S/cm at 25\u00b0C. These calibration solutions also have a limited shelf life. We use a shortened graduated cylinder (plastic 100ml cylinder with the top half removed) to calibrate this long sensor ( Figure S1 ). Be sure to rinse and dry the probe thoroughly with dH 2 O before and after calibration and before reinserting it back into the sensor loop. When returned back to the system, the probe is inserted all the way down into the opening. Retighten the PVC compression nut to prevent leaks! Do not over-tighten this fitting! Actual system conductivity should be around 50.6msem/cm2. tThis reading depends on the temperature (Specific gravity is equal to 1.024). The conductivity sensor should have a long lifespan of several years. Given the single point calibration, one may find the readings to be off somewhat. Actual conductivity should be verified independently using a second device. The RO pump output set point for regulating conductivity should be adjusted accordingly to achieve the actual desired level.",

This condition is very destructive. Cavitation is noted by a loud grounding noise. The sound is loud and very distinct: sounding like gravel or sand is moving through the pump. Cavitation can occur when the pump is starved of inlet water (e.g., pump inlet valve #4 is not completely open), the sump inlet cage is clogged, sump water level is too low (below the pump's cut water level), or air has entered the inlet side from leaks in the PVC unions. Higher differential pressure on the outlet side may also cause cavitation, such as when the filters are clogged or outlet valve #1 is not completely open or there is not enough bypass water returning back to the sump via the side loop, sensor loop or main bypass loop to help reduce outlet pressure (Figure 2 , see Section 30: The Main Bypass Valve, below).

Valve #7 can also be used to drain the system to the cut level of the main pump. Likewise, drain valve #3 (Figure 3L; Figure S2C ) can be used to tap water or to empty the system, but be aware that the water will also exist with considerable pressure while the main pump is running (Not recommended!). To open this valve, one must insert the quick connector with an attached hose, and be certain to secure this hose so that it does not get loose ( Figure  3L ; Figure S2J ; all hoses should be secured with hose clamps!). Warning! If the main pump is running, water will leave this valve with considerable pressure. It is not recommended that valve #3 be used to drain the system while the water pump is on, as that water is under very high pressure. It is best to use the accessory filler valve (#7) for this purpose. Water can also be drained from valve #3 by gravity alone, when the pump is not running, and the system is shut off!

Note that this valve could be used for automated or semi-manual, weekly water changes (approx. 10% per week) to reduce the levels of nitrates (see notes related to Accessory Water Filler Tap (Valve #7, Figure 2; Figure S2E ). These types of mechanical valves are somewhat unreliable, as they may stick open or closed. In addition, these float valves do not have very tight dead-bands for precise control of the water level. Therefore, we do not use this feature. Instead, we have installed an automatic top off unit that uses redundant optical sensors to detect changes in the water level and a small electromechanical pump (see below).

One should make sure that all openings are covered (Figures 1D, G-I, K; 3B; see Additional File 3B-D). This includes plugging the small unused holes located in the tank lids. Covers are also located on the trough drains, down spouts, the sump filter pad area (i.e., the clear plastic \"Origami\" cover) and above the sump heater and protein skimmer compartment. To limit evaporation from the drain troughs, we machined a set of PVC covers that contain a series of smaller holes to accept the tank drain pipes (Figure 1H-I) . However, sealing the system increases system temperature, as described in Section 13: Aquarium System Temperature Regulation, above. (Figures 1K, 4N) : There are two covers for openings in the top of the sump. One smaller, grey PVC plastic cover is located over the left sump compartment that houses the heater and skimmer, and was provided by Iwaki Aquatics, Inc. (Figures 1K, 4N) . This cover should always remain in place and has a small slot added along the back side for the skimmer power cord. Another small hole accepts the Teflon feeding line. The right compartment that carries the coarse filter and perforated filter plate and receives the return drain water has a 1/8\" thick clear polycarbonate \"Origami\" style cover to prevent splashing and some evaporation (Additional File 3D, see warnings above, regarding increasing water temperatures described in Section 13: Aquarium System Temperature Regulation). There is not a lot of room above the sump in this area and this special design was needed to fit over this opening. The Origami cover is fashioned from a single piece of 1/8 inch think polycarbonate folded on a sheet metal break (see Additional File 3D for diagram). In addition, a small piece of Saran wrap is first draped over the slotted PVC water diverter to cut down splashing (Figure S3A ).",

Outlet pressure can be monitored using the round effluent pressure gauge. Presently, during Filtering mode this pressure runs at about 10-11 PSI. During Feeding mode, it climbs to approximately 13-14 PSI. So far, we have not needed to use the bypass loop and have kept this valve #5 closed, since enough water usually returns to the sump via the tanks, side filter loop and the sensor loop. As more tanks are brought on line, there is less need to use the main bypass loop, as even greater water flow returns via the tanks, side filter loop and sensor loop. In this case, the valve can be left closed. However, if one reduces the flow to the tanks or uses a smaller number of tanks this valve would need to be opened, just enough to drop outlet pressures and to stop cavitation from occurring.",

            "text": "This system consists of a Neptune Systems (\"ATK\") Automatic Top-off Kit (ver. 2, Morgan Hill, CA) automatic top-off kit, which automatically adds artificial sea water to the sump to compensate for any drop in sea water level due to salt loss (Figures 2, 4H-J) . Water spray, splashing and salt creep eventually reduce the overall volume and additional sea water must be added to raise the sump level to allow for proper operation of the protein skimmer, etc. The ATO unit consists of a microcontroller, two optical water level sensors mounted in a magnetic bracket, a small self-priming water pump (\"PMUP\"), plastic tubing and an anti-siphon break. The reserve sea water is stored in a 5 gallon plastic paint bucket (Figures 2, 4H-I) . Two small holes are drilled into the lid to allow for passage of the two sensor wires, motor power cord and plastic water line. Freshly prepared artificial sea water is added to the bucket, but never all the way to the top (see below). Depending on the relative heights of the water in the sump vs. the external reservoir, an anti-siphon break must be installed in the tubing. The anti-siphon break must be located inside the reservoir bucket above the level of the reserve sea water! It has a small hole for the side vent that must angle downward so that ejected sea water will be directed back into the reservoir. It is normal for some sea water to be expelled from this hole during pumping. The small PMUP water pump is placed upright in the bottom of the bucket ( Figure 4I) . As precipitate can form in artificial sea water, a small sieve is used to protect the pump. For this purpose, we place the pump intake inside of The Republic of Tea's \"The People's Brew Basket\" (Novato, CA) nylon mesh tea strainer, which is 3\" in diameter and 2-1/2\" tall ( Figure 4I) . The 24 VDC pump has a magnetic drive impeller and was originally designed to pump RODI water. The impeller shaft has a magnetic drive impeller with an exposed ferrite rotor. These ferrite ceramic magnets have excellent corrosion resistance. We have not experienced any problems with corrosion, but it is best to periodically monitored this on a regular basis to make sure the rotor spins freely. To prevent additional pumping from occurring during a feeding cycle, which temporarily lowers the sump's water level, the microcontroller is put on a 24 hour timer (Figure 4H) , so that it only runs once each day for 30 mins (during a nonfeeding, filtering cycle). For extra security, this time window is set to operate during normal working hours so that operators are more likely to be present to observe any problems that may occur with water delivery. When the unit is on a blue light will be illuminated on the microcontroller. During pumping a green light will be seen. Any problems will trigger and audible alarm and a red light will be illuminated. Whenever an alarm is sounded, the unit goes into arrest and the power must be cycled to reset the ATO. Two optical sensors monitor water level in the sump. These are mounted in a magnetic bracket located inside the front right corner of the sump (Figures 1K, 2, 4M) . The lower sensor is the main sensor and the upper sensor serves as a redundant backup, should the main sensor fail. (Due to space constraints, an additional backup in the form of a small mechanical float valve, has been removed from the bracket.) Due to the presence of the sump filter pad and sieve plate, the bracket had to be rotated 180 degrees for better clearance. This simply reverses the two optical sensor inputs that need to be plugged into the microcontroller (# 1 and #2). These two electrical plugs have been re-labeled so that they now correspond to the proper numbers on the microcontroller. The bracket for the optical sensors must be positioned at the correct height for the desired sump water level to be achieved. A strong magnet and sticky rubber pads hold the bracket in place (Figures 2, 4M) . The correct water level should be located at the center of the pyramidal lens covering the main (lower-most) sensor. To get the proper adjustment, this has to be done while the system is running and during a non-feeding cycle. The course filter pad and sieve plate will need to be removed (see Section 19: Accessing the Right Sump Compartment). Once correctly positioned, the external orange magnet must not be moved. From time to time, pre-pared artificial sea water will need to be added to the 5 gallon plastic reservoir bucket. Sea water added to the system should be prepared at least a day in advance to allow the salts to dissolve and be able to adjust and stabilize the salinity. Do not mix artificial sea salts directly in the reservoir. A third optical sensor is installed in this reservoir to monitor its sea water level, and to ensure that the pump will not run dry. When low, the alarm will sound, alerting users to add more sea water. Again, if there is an alarm, the power must be interrupted to reset the system (which is normally accomplished each day by the 24 hour wall timer). This third optical sensor is held in place by a small magnet, so care is needed to make sure the position is not changed (Figure 4I) . The sensor should be set approximately two inches from the bottom of the reservoir: the cut level of the small pump. There are no settings that can be adjusted on the stock ATK microcontroller; however, more complex control can be accomplished, if this unit is attached to a Neptune Systems \"Apex Controller.\" The plastic supply tubing from the PMUP is directed to the far right back corner of the sump (Figures 2, 4J) .",

            "text": "To allow for the passage of this tubing and the two wires for the optical sensors into the sump, a small amount has to be cut off of the very back-right corner of the removable coarse filter sieve plate. Zip ties are used to secure the tubing to the far right rear aluminum rack upright support bar ( Figure 4J ). Note that when combined with the Iwaki RODI pump that counters evaporation, water level can be precisely maintained to within 1-2mm inside the sump. Figure 5B , D). The microcontroller receives several sensor inputs. These sensors determine 1) the level of food present in the food reservoir via a non-contact capacitance sensor ( Figure 5E , see Additional File 3F-G), 2) whether food has actually been loaded into the Teflon feeding line, and 3) when food is cleared from that line to ensure accurate and complete delivery of the phytoplankton via a pulsed infrared sensor ( Figure 5F , see Additional File 7, Additional File 8, Additional File 9, Additional File 10, Additional File 11, Additional File 12). The microcontroller also operates two 120 volt AC relays located inside a remote outlet box ( Figure 5C , Additional File 4, Additional File 5) to 1) activate a magnetic stir plate (used to resuspend the food in the food reservoir 5 mins before feeding; Figure 5B ) and 2) to activate the aquarium air-pump (used to finally purged residual food from the Teflon feeding line; Figure 5C, D) . A battery backup real-time clock (RTC) reports the current time and date and lets the microcontroller know when it is time to activate and terminate the feeding cycles. Note that one may wish to reset the correct time on the RTC for any daylight savings time changes. This has to be done using a different Arduino program sketch. The timing of feeding cycles must be programmed into the Arduino microcontroller's sketch. Note that we have currently set feeding cycles for 24 mins every 2 hours, with 2.8 ml of diluted food being delivered during each feeding (36.6ml/day, equal to equal to 2.24x10 9 cells/ml). Since this food is pre-diluted to a strength of 75% with sterile dH 2 O, the actual amount of concentrated undiluted food being delivered is 2.1ml/2 hrs, or 25.2ml/day. A digital hi/low (1/0) output communicates with the Walchem 900 aquarium system controller (signal sent to solid state relay (D5) in the Walchem 900 controller) to tell the aquarium when it is time to activate a feeding cycle and redirect the filter bypass valve. Likewise, a digital hi/low (0/1) pulsed output sends a signal to the peristaltic pump to activate a pre-programmed feeding cycle. These parameters (including the number of steps (volume) and speed (steps per min) must be entered directly into the custom stepper motor controller's memory using its joystick interface (see Additional File 13, Additional File 14). Once set, these pumping programs are non-volatile and are stored permanently in memory, to be recalled in the event of a power failure. Thus, there is no need to adjust the feeding system if the power should cycle.",

The pump head accepts a short length of 4mm OD x 2mm ID silicone tubing, which is connected to barbed Luer lock hose adapters, a single Luer lock Y connector and a one-way check valve (Qosina, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL). Together, these create a pump to withdraw food from a reservoir and dispense this to the aquarium system ( Figure 5B-D, and Additional File 2) . The food is ultimately passed to the aquarium system through 1/8\" Teflon tubing. A special flangeless compression fitting is used to attach the 1/8\" Teflon tubing to this valve system (HPLC waste line adapter, HPLC-LL-1/8-KIT; CPLabSafety, San Francisco, CA; Figure 5D ). This tubing is directed to the left sump compartment through a hole drilled in the top of the small removable PVC sump cover located directly above the aquarium system main water pump intake (Figures 2, 4N) . Note that the silicone tubing and other parts ( Figure 5D ) will need to be sanitized and/or replaced periodically. Any problems in the delivery of the food will be detected by the IR food line sensor (Additional File 9, Additional File 10, Additional File 11, Additional File 12) and users will be alerted to the problem via email and text messages, and they should correct the issue as soon as possible. Such problems typically involve only one or both of the feeding valves. For cleaning, parts of the feeding system including the silicone tubing, Luer lock connections, supply tube and Teflon feeding line should be removed, rinsed several times with sterile dH 2 O and finally cleaned with 2-3 rinsed of 70% ethanol. After cleaning, the parts should be dried and reassembled. Parts should be checked to make sure they are tight. These inexpensive parts should be replaced every 6-12 months or sooner, as needed. At the same time, the food reservoir should be cleaned, autoclaved and refilled with fresh food.",

The use of the peristaltic pump has proven to be very reliable and precise in terms of the volume of food that is delivered. Furthermore, this setup is less costly. One note of caution, however, as the silicone tubing wears out the volume delivered may change. Peristaltic pumps that use stepper motors are ideal as they produce high torque with precise degrees of rotation. The same input from the main feeding controller is used to trigger a preset number of steps (at the preset speed (rpms)) to deliver the correct, pre-calibrated volume of food. The volume of food will depend on the diameter of the silicone tubing used in the peristaltic pump. Therefore, one will have to calibrate the volume and number of steps needed to deliver the desired amount of food. The stepper motor has 200 steps per revolution and is rated for no more than 60RPM. We generally set the speed to 50RPM.",

When first inoculating the system with bacteria, inactivate the UV lamp (HOA OFF mode) the skimmer (HOA OFF mode) and the feeding bypass valve (HOA OFF mode) by entering these settings in HOA. One can add Seed bacteria (Aquavitro, Seachem, Madison, GA) or Dr. Tim's One and Only Live Nitrifying Bacteria (Dr. Tim's Aquatics, Ltd., Moorpark, CA) to the sump following the manufacturers' instructions, and allow the system to circulate in filter mode. In addition, or alternatively, one can add some filtered sea water from an already established system to inoculate the biofilters (in our case we added 1 liter of filtered water, in addition to Dr. Tim's solution). To prevent any larger organisms, embryos or larvae from being transferred to the new system, we filtered this water by gravity using number 1 Whatman filter paper, which has a porosity of about 11\u00b5m. We then added ammonium chloride (9ml of 50mg/ml solution per 40 gallons, or a final concentration of 2ppm in the system) for the bacteria and monitor ammonium, nitrite and nitrate levels. To cycle the aquarium using ammonia, add enough of a 50mg/ml solution of ammonium chloride (NH 4 + Cl -, VWR, 0621-500g, Radnor, PA) to reach a concentration of 2mg/L (ppm). We added 9ml of 50mg/ml ammonium chloride solution per 40 gallons, to a final concentration of 2ppm in the system. Continue dosing with ammonium chloride every two to three days to maintain ammonium levels at 2ppm until they begin to drop and nitrite levels start to rise. During the initial cycling of the aquarium, levels of ammonia and nitrite should be measured every 2-3 days. To monitor the levels of ammonia, nitrites and nitrates, we use test kits produced by API Marine (Mars Fishcare North America, Chalfont, PA). During this process, occasionally allow some water to circulate through the feeding bypass loop by activating the motorized bypass valve for a few mins (HOA, Hand Mode). Within two weeks, levels of ammonia should start to decrease (<1ppm), and nitrite levels will rise. The appearance of nitrite in the system indicates the presence of ammoniaoxidizing bacteria. Reduced doses of ammonia can continue to be added to the system every few days, being careful not to exceed 5ppm. Higher levels (>5ppm) of ammonia and nitrites will inhibit the growth of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. Nitrite levels will slowly increase, and should spike around 2-3 weeks after the initial addition of ammonia. Continue to monitor ammonia and nitrite levels in the system, adding low doses of ammonia every few days, keeping nitrite levels below 5ppm. Continue until nitrite levels drop to 0ppm. The inoculation procedure should only have to be done once when first setting up the system.",

Being impatient, we began to add SEED over the next 8 days following the manufacturer's instructions. By the 7 th day we started to detect nitrites, and four days later there was no detectable ammonia, and detectable (high) levels of nitrites and nitrates. At this time a very hardy animal (e.g., a blue damsel fish) was added to the system. The addition of an animal provides a small amount of ammonia to support some of the bacteria in the system. If not using an animal, continue to add ammonia every few days, until both ammonia and nitrite levels recover to zero. When the ammonium and nitrite levels have finally been reduced to zero, it is safe to begin adding other live animals. It can take several weeks for this to occur, and one must have patience. Nitrate levels may be very high after this procedure, though the system is designed to reduce these levels over time, which was eventually our experience. If nitrate levels remain high, one should perform water changes. Up to a quarter of the sea water may be exchanged each time with freshly mixed sea water to reduce nitrate levels; though, in our own experience, we observed these to fall to 0ppm over the course of several weeks without any water changes. In our system, with a relatively light animal load, we observed only 5ppm nitrate after 7 months of use, and have not yet needed to perform any water changes.

Loosen the PVC unions connecting the main pump to valve #4 ( Figure S2A ) and finally the motorized bypass ball valve (Figure 5I , Figure S2H ). Loosen/remove the bolts that attach the motor to the bottom shelf ( Figure 1L) . These bolts are held on using simple wing nuts. Keep track of the locations of the nuts, bolts and rubber motor mounts. Before removing the pump, note that it is very important to have something ready (e.g., the new replacement motor/impeller, to support the heavy motorized ball valve, as well as the free disconnected unions for valves #1 and 4! An extra set of hands is useful. Install the new pump motor by reversing these steps. Reconnect the motor's power cord. Return any collected sea water back to the sump. Restore system power, while carefully inspecting for any leaks.",

Figure S3 . Replacing the mechanical filters. A. The clear plastic Origami cover has been removed exposing the large opening over the right compartment of the sump and the coarse filter pad. Note cellophane that is draped over the slotted drain diverter to limit splashing and to direct the drain water through the coarse filter pad. B. Removal of the coarse filter pad. This pad acts like a large sponge and retains a lot of sea water. Remove the pad slowly and tilt it upwards to allow residual sea water to drain back into the sump before discarding the pad. C. After the old pad has been removed, the perforated sieve plate is exposed, which supports the filter pad. A new pad is placed on top of the sieve plate, and the cellophane and Origami covers are replaced. If access is needed to the right compartment of the sump, the sieve plate can be removed by lifting up the top lid of the sump about an inch or two and sliding the plate out towards the viewer. The slotted drain divertor will need to be removed to lift the top lid. D. Preparation for replacement of the pleated mechanical filter cartridge. Note white coloration of the new cartridge compared to the old cartridge inside the filter bowl. A bucket is used to collect sea water that may spill during replacement. E. To help drain some water from the filter, air is allowed to enter the bowl by pressing the red purge valve F. The filter bowl is loosened using the filter wrench, as shown. Continue to unscrew the bowl using one's hands. Pull the old cartridge out of the bowl and replace it with the new one.

Figure S4 . Calibrating the pH and conductivity sensors. A. Prepare for calibration by turning off Valve (#2). B. Loosening the large gray union that retains the pH probe. A filter wrench can be used to help loosen stuborn fittings. C. Removal of the pH probe from the sensor side loop for calibration. Yellow arrows show the direction of water flow through the sensor side loop. Note that both ends of the pH sensor probe and its internal stainless steel temperature sensor should be oriented (rotated) so that they are exposed to the on-coming flow of sea water. D. Calibration of the pH probe using standard calibration solutions. Follow the on-screen instructions after entering the appropriate Walchem 900 calibration menu. E. Two adjustable wrenches are used to loosen the conductivity sensor. Only the top black plastic fitting is to be loosened. The stainless steel probe simply slides out. Unlike the pH probe, there is no specific orientation for the conductivity probe, as long as it is seated deep enough to that a sufficient amount of sea water flows through the tip. Calibration of the conductivity probe is similar to that of the pH probe using a single standard calibration solution.
