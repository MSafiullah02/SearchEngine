In puppies, degradation of feces quality is associated with a reduced daily weight gain and an increased risk of death (Grellet et al., 2012).",

Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Toxocara canis, Cystoisospora ohioensis complex, Cystoisospora canis, canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV2) and canine coronavirus (CCV) are the most prevalent (Hackett and Lappin, 2003). However, as in other species, diarrhea is multifactorial, involving factors intrinsic to the dog (breed size and age), nutritional factors (diet change without transition, food type and quality), together with lifestyle and environmental stressors (Weber et al., 2002, Weber et al., 2003, Sokolow et al., 2005, Hernot et al., 2006, Stavisky et al., 2011). Most studies on risk factors of diarrhea in young dogs focused on one single pathogen or a group of pathogens without taking into account environmental stressors (Finlaison, 1995, Buehl et al., 2006, Grellet et al., 2012, Tupler et al., 2012). Moreover most of the studies considering multiple enteropathogens infections were performed in shelters, in a context far different from that in breeding kennels (Sokolow et al., 2005, Tupler et al., 2012). The purpose of this epidemiological study was to determine prevalence of enteropathogens in puppies in breeding kennels and to perform a risk factors analysis for diarrhea during the weaning period including enteropathogens, environment and management procedures.",

For each kennel, data concerning environmental factors (number of puppies sold per year, and litter size for each puppies included), management of the kennel and puppies (number of meals distributed per day, access to outdoor, vaccination) and puppies\u2019 characteristics (age, breed, sex), were collected. Puppies vaccinated within the preceding 10 days before the visit were not included.",

Variables of the final partial least squares regression with a VIP value over 0.8 were not collinear (r\n2\n < 0.10). These variables were subsequently integrated as independent variables and assessed as a fixed effect in a generalized linear mixed model (proc GLIMMIX) with fecal consistency as a binary outcome (logit transformation).

Prevalence of this clinical sign, affecting both growth and survival was high with 24.8% of puppies between 5 and 14 weeks concerned. Among the seven different enteropathogens (2 viruses and 5 parasites) tested in this study, 77.1% of puppies were infected by at least one virus or parasite, and 55.3% carried multiple organisms. Prevalence of parasites was higher than the prevalence of viruses (74.4% vs 34.6%). This high prevalence of multiple infections is in accordance with a previous study on dogs entering animal shelters in which 55% of them presented multiple digestive infections (Tupler et al., 2012). In our study, 14.7% of puppies were excreting CPV2, 20.3% by CCV. However, only 0.4% of puppies presented a mixed infection by these two viruses. Prevalence of these viruses depends on age, lifestyle and health status of dogs. Serological and virological investigations demonstrated that CCV and CPV2 are highly prevalent in kennels and animal shelters compared to single owned dogs (Rimmelzwaan et al., 1991, Tennant et al., 1993, Bandai et al., 1999, Naylor et al., 2001b, Schulz et al., 2008). Moreover a higher prevalence of CCV and CPV2 was described in young animals under 6 months of age compared to adult dogs (Sakulwira et al., 2003, Gates and Nolan, 2009a, Gates and Nolan, 2009b, Epe et al., 2010). In addition to the wide distribution and contagiosity of these viruses, the methods used for detection of these viruses can also contribute to this high prevalence. PCR assays have been proven to be up to 4 \u00d7 104 times more sensitive than electronic microscopy and virus isolation for detection of CCV (Naylor et al., 2001a). This method is able to detect virus in the feces of low-grade shedding animals below 106 particles per gram of unprocessed feces, which is considered the detection limit for electronic microscopy. In our study, a higher prevalence of CPV2, CCV was observed in breeding kennels producing 30 puppies per year or more. The higher prevalence in this sub-population could be linked to the contagiousness of these pathogens and their stability in the environment (Terpstra et al., 2007, Eterpi et al., 2010). The close contact between animals and the density of puppies could promote the environmental contamination and subsequently the spread of the infection.",

            "text": "17.9% of puppies in our study were found excreting a high load of CPV2. This virus is well described as inducing hemorrhagic diarrhea associated with vomiting, anorexia, dehydration and depression (Meunier et al., 1985, Prittie, 2004). However, in our study, CPV2 also increased risk of weaning diarrhea but without systemic signs, as already described, and 12.5% of dogs without gastrointestinal disease excreted this virus (Grellet et al., 2012). Thus our study demonstrated that puppies can excrete high viral loads of CPV2 without any systemic sign. This observation is in accordance with one previous study in which fecal excretion was also quantified by PCR (Schmitz et al., 2009). However studies using less sensitive methods (fecal antibody-based antigen tests, immune-electron microscopy) did not observed this healthy carrier status (Hackett and Lappin, 2003, Desario et al., 2005, Sokolow et al., 2005, Schulz et al., 2008, Schmitz et al., 2009). The lack of systemic clinical signs on these puppies could be linked either to an efficient systemic immunity or to local intestinal immunity (Rice et al., 1982, Macartney et al., 1988). Fecal IgA, endogenous or provided by milk, protect intestinal mucosa by inhibiting the adherence of pathogens, thereby preventing adhesion of these pathogens. Canine milk was found rich in IgA (Heddle and Rowley, 1975) with high levels of CPV2 antibodies (Decaro et al., 2004). These antibodies, repeatedly ingested in large quantities by the puppies during the first weeks of life, could provide some protection to the intestinal mucosa against CPV2 deleterious effects decreasing the systemic clinical signs associated to CPV2 infection (septicaemia, dehydration). Nevertheless these clinically healthy animals probably represent major sources of virus for other animals and for the environmental contamination. Interestingly, in our study, young puppies (between 5 and 8 weeks of age) presented a higher infection rate by CPV2 than older ones. This result highlights the interest of vaccination before 8 weeks of age in breeding kennels to limit CPV2 spreading. The interference with maternally derived antibodies considered as one of the most important causes of immunization failure in puppies (Macartney et al., 1988), can be overcome by the use of high titer CPV2 vaccines (De Cramer et al., 2010).",

In our study, 20.3% of puppies were infected by CCV, but this virus was not identified as a risk factor of abnormal feces. Implications of CCV in acute dog diarrhea are controversial. No relation between coronavirus and diarrhea was observed in different studies, with more healthy dogs infected by this virus than dogs with diarrhea in some of these studies (Sokolow et al., 2005, Schulz et al., 2008, Tupler et al., 2012). However, CCV was also described as a virus inducing severe gastroenteritis, lethal in some cases (Evermann et al., 2005, Buonavoglia et al., 2006, Decaro et al., 2008, Decaro et al., 2009). These variations in clinical signs could be linked to variations in pathogenicity between strains (Escutenaire et al., 2007), to the age of infected dogs (Decaro et al., 2009), to the number of genotypes infecting puppies simultaneously (Decaro et al., 2005) or to the association of the coronavirus with other enteropathogens (Appel, 1988). Neither C. Ohioensis complex nor C. canis were associated with weaning diarrhea in our study. Impact of these parasites on weaning diarrhea is still controversial (Buehl, 2006). This difference of clinical signs observed between studies may be explained by differences in the age of infected dogs, the environmental conditions and the virulence of species.",
