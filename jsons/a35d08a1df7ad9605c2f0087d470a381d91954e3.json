The epidemiological features of the disease are still unknown, and the number of total cases and the number of total deaths varies day by day. When the rapid spread and serious consequences of the disease were observed, precautions were taken and positive cases began to be recorded after the second half of January. Because the number of total cases and the number of total deaths are used for examining the course of the outbreak, modelling of these indicators are the important issue. The model results are valuable for determining the appropriate preventions. In the literature, it was observed that some models were used for short-term forecasts considering the previous data. It is possible to reduce the number of total cases and total deaths by taking necessary precautions. At this point, it is very important to make future estimates.",

But the stationary assumption is not provided yet. The difference from the second degree was taken and the series became stationary. According to the ACF and PACF charts, the series quickly approached zero after the first delay in the ACF graph. In this case, since p = 0, d = 2 and q = 1, it was modeled by the integrated first degree moving averages method. In other words, the most suitable time series method was the ARIMA (0,2,1) model.

According to their study, the Logistics model was reported to be better than the others by the R 2 criterion conducted extensive research in quasi-experimental analysis method in various provinces in China and investigated the relationship between population and number of outbreak cases [19, 20] . In their study, they found that the correlation coefficients of the relationship between the population and the number of cases differed among regions. They have observed that the number of cases was high in regions with high population and there was a high correlation between them. They stated that factors such as immigrants, tourism and mobility plays an important role in this. Also the authors determined the number of cases with the epidemic growth model Fan et al. [19] . Roosa et al. (2020) analyzed the number of cases in some regions in China with generalized logistic growth model (GLM), Richards Model and Sub-Epidemic Model in a short-term (10 days).

Yuan [26] [27] [28] [29] . In our study, we compared the time series analysis using Weibull, Negative Exponential, Von Bertalanffy, Janoscheck, Lundqvist-Korf and Sloboda models, which are different from the methods used in previous studies. According to the literature, there is no publication about nonlinear mathematical models used in our study on coronavirus outbreak before.",

Their R 2 and MKE statistics were similar. The parameter estimation and compliance statistics of the Negative Exponential and von Bertalanffy models, which are among the nonlinear models, differed in both the number of cases and the number of deaths. When nonlinear models are examined, R 2 value, which is used as a criterion in comparing models, was obtained from the lowest Negative Exponential model both in the number of total cases and the number of total deaths. The lowest MSE was obtained from Sloboda model for the number of total cases and from Lundqvist-Korf model for the number of total deaths.",

The number of total cases were modelled with ARIMA(0,2,1) that is a moving averages method, while the number of total deaths were modeled by the Holt linear trend model, which is a exponential smoothing method. According to the estimation results, we estimate that the number of total cases and deaths will be increase and this will be a big danger. For this result, all necessary precautions must be taken against the danger.",
