In addition, a number of brave ophthalmologists have volunteered to wage battle in ravaged emergency rooms (ER) and intensive care units (ICU) around the world. These courageous souls represent the best of our community during very difficult circumstances, and we are very proud of their contributions.",

In fact, recently a local health official [2] quoted the great Winston Churchill, who charismatically guided the UK and the allied nations through the Second World War to eventual victory. In an effort to urge greater resiliency of her constituency in the fight against the coronavirus which continues to infect thousands of people every day, just here in the state of California, she noted: \u201c\u2026this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\u201d",

It is clear that one of the reasons for the higher death rate in Italy may relate to severely ill COVID patients who did not receive necessary supportive care in time because hospitals were overwhelmed by deathly sick coronavirus patients. Here in California, social isolation policies have thus far been very successful, and the curve has been presumably flattened. Hospitals and ICUs across the state are operating under capacity, and all patients have been receiving the supportive care that they need [3].",

Here in California, the daily rate of new infections has steadily risen at approximately 1500 to 3000 cases per day, and mortality has continued at approximately 60 to 80 deaths or more per day for the last several weeks, despite increasingly warm temperatures [3]. Does it make sense therefore to continue to isolate communities when our hospitals are operating comfortably and infection rates are not abating? What is the cost of this policy? This is an ethically, complicated question, as there is no ideal or perfect solution. Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 are a terrible tragedy but they are relatively easy to track. The long-term consequences of current policy in terms of mental health and societal decay are much more difficult to quantify.",

So far, almost 30 million jobs have been lost, the unemployment rate has ballooned to 23%, and 22 million citizens in the USA alone have filed for unemployment insurance from the government which will have to doll out hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars as compensation [4, 5]. As President Trump has stated, we now have the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression [4, 5]. Hundreds and thousands of businesses, especially small businesses, are at risk of collapse as they dip into their limited reserves to pay employees shuttered at home and attempt to cover overhead without any stream of cash flow for the last several months. The growing societal problem of the homeless, already a major issue in urban cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, is accelerating, and this may establish a nidus for an even greater risk of infection from COVID and other insipid diseases. Mental health has suffered as masses of people sit idle at home unable to work and provide for their families and frustrated at the loss of their civil liberties and privileges such as playing in the park or walking on the beach. In fact, 45% of US adults concede that their mental health has deteriorated due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the shelter-in-place orders, and calls and texts to crisis lines have dramatically increased [6]. Depression, suicide, and domestic violence are becoming pervasive problems in many of our struggling communities during this crisis [7].",

Are we climbing a slippery slope of a virtual existence where we will no longer condone human contact and interaction? Will we forever communicate on line through webcasts and zoom sessions forsaking all face to face exchange? It is clear that COVID is not going away anytime soon. The risk of infection may continue throughout the coming months and even into next year. Until the advent of herd immunity or a vaccine, which both seem many months away, we cannot evade this invisible enemy. Perhaps, the focus of our policies should be more targeted and aimed toward protecting and isolating the elderly and the infirmed and those with comorbid conditions until a vaccine or effective antiviral treatment is available. Continued implementation of social distancing policies and reduction of transmission through improved community hygiene is essential while gradually restarting the economy and reintroducing civil liberties so that one crisis will not be replaced by another.",

The current crisis and our raised fears and anxieties of infection threaten to drive an even greater wedge through human connection. Communication through a screen or digital interface to allay our ever-growing unease with human contact sadly may become our predominate means of interaction. Certainly, this is not the direction we want to go. We stand to lose so much through these forms of aseptic communication that lack vibrancy and engagement and are void of dynamic interchange and instruction. Virtual reality will lead to a world devoid of soul and emotion and human spirit, a sterile and lifeless way of life in which the many benefits of face to face engagement will be completely lost. We need to overcome our fears and reach out and touch the awesome world that we live in and understand that we cannot hide at home behind our computers forever in a virtual reality devoid of human intimacy and vibrant exchange.",
