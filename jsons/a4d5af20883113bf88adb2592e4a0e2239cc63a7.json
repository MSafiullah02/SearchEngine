Methods: A total of 1,015 canine serum samples were randomly selected from submissions to a diagnostic laboratory between March and December 2014, and were analysed for CRCoV antibodies using a competitive ELISA. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine associations between seroprevalence of CRCoV and breed category, age, sex, sampling month, region, and reported health status of dogs. Results: Overall, 538/1,015 (53.0%) samples were seropositive for CRCoV, with 492/921 (53.4%) positive dogs in the North Island and 46/94 (49%) in the South Island. Age of dog, sampling month, region, and presence of abnormal respiratory signs were included in the initial logistic regression model. Seroprevalence was higher in dogs aged \u22653 compared with \u22642 years (p < 0.01). The lowest seroprevalence was observed in July (30/105; 28.5%) and August (32/100; 32%), and the highest in June (74/100; 74%). Seroprevalence in dogs from Auckland was higher than in dogs from the Hawkes Bay, Manawatu, Marlborough, and Waikato regions (p < 0.05). Abnormal respiratory signs (coughing, nasal discharge, or sneezing) were reported for 28/1,015 (2.8%) dogs sampled. Seroprevalence for CRCoV tended to be higher among dogs with respiratory signs (67.9 (95% CI = 47.6-83.4)%) than dogs with no reported respiratory signs (52.6 (95% CI = 49.5-55.7)%). Conclusions: Serological evidence of infection with CRCoV was present in more than half of the dogs tested from throughout New Zealand. Differences in CRCoV seroprevalence between regions and lack of seasonal pattern indicate that factors other than external temperatures may be important in the epidemiology of CRCoV in New Zealand.

The virus was first isolated from dogs with respiratory disease in a rehoming shelter in the United Kingdom (Erles et al. 2003) . On the day of admission to that shelter 30% of dogs were seropositive, and nearly all seronegative dogs seroconverted to CRCoV after a 3-week stay at the shelter, indicating high transmissibility of the virus. The presence of CRCoV antibody on entry to the shelter was associated with decreased risk of development of respiratory disease, suggesting an aetiological involvement of the virus in infectious canine tracheobronchitis (ICT). Results of several further studies in the United Kingdom and other countries also suggested that CRCoV contributes to development of respiratory disease in infected dogs (Erles and Brownlie 2005; Ellis et al. 2005; Kaneshima et al. 2006) . However affected dogs were often coinfected with several respiratory pathogens, and not all dogs with serological evidence of recent CRCoV infection developed respiratory disease, making the establishment of an aetiological link between CRCoV infection and disease challenging (Erles et al. 2003; Erles and Brownlie 2005) . This is similar to the situation observed for other respiratory pathogens of dogs, underscoring the fact that the aetiology of ICT is complex and factors other than exposure to a specific pathogen are likely to contribute to the outcome of infection (Erles and Brownlie 2008; Mitchell et al. 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 171, "text": "(Erles et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 282, "end": 301, "text": "(Erles et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 911, "end": 936, "text": "(Erles and Brownlie 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 937, "end": 955, "text": "Ellis et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 956, "end": 978, "text": "Kaneshima et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1277, "text": "(Erles et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1302, "text": "Erles and Brownlie 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1555, "end": 1580, "text": "(Erles and Brownlie 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1581, "end": 1602, "text": "Mitchell et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Canine respiratory coronavirus is closely related to bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and human coronavirus-OC43, but distinct from canine enteric coronavirus (CECoV) , which belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus, and is an aetiological agent of enteric disease in dogs (Erles et al. 2003; Decaro et al. 2007) .

Although samples in the current study originated from a wider geographical area, including the South Island, the majority of samples were from the central and lower North Island, so of similar distribution to the previous study. The difference in seroprevalence is also unlikely to be attributed to differences in the serological tests used, as the sensitivity and specificity of BCoV-based competitive ELISA for detection of CRCoV antibody was reported to be 94.4% and 96.7%, respectively, when compared to a fluorescent antibody test with CRCoV antigen that was used in the previous study (Priestnall et al. 2006) . The timing of sample collection may have contributed to the differences observed between the two studies. Unfortunately, the timing of sample collection was not provided by Knesl et al.

Similar to our results, other studies found regional differences in CRCoV seroprevalence, as can be exemplified by differences between various regions in the United States of America and in the United Kingdom. It has been suggested that the CRCoV seroprevalence may be higher in areas with a higher density of humans, and therefore presumably canine, populations (Priestnall et al. 2006 ). However CRCoV seroprevalence was similar in some of the less densely populated regions of the South Island and the more densely populated region of Auckland. On the other hand, regional differences were apparent, as seroprevalence in dogs from Auckland was higher in comparison to dogs from the Hawkes Bay, Manawatu, Marlborough, and Waikato regions. One possible reason for these differences is sample size and associated selection bias. In addition, population density in most parts of New Zealand, possibly with the exception of Auckland, is not uniform. Hence it may have been of interest to stratify the samples by the size of town/city, in addition to the geographical region. This was not performed as we did not have access to addresses of the submitters beyond the region classification.

This is most easily explained by the increased likelihood of exposure to the virus for older dogs, which had more opportunities for contact with infectious dogs or contaminated environments than younger dogs. However we did not see a relative decline in the percentage of seropositive dogs among those older than 10 years, as reported by Priestnall et al. (2006 Priestnall et al. ( , 2007 .
