The ILD consist of disorders of known cause (e.g., collagen vascular diseases, drug-related diseases) as well as disorders of unknown etiology. The latter include idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), and a group of miscellaneous, rare, but nonetheless interesting, diseases. In patients with ILD, MDCT enriches the diagnostic armamentarium by allowing volumetric high-resolution scanning, i.e., continuous data acquisition with thin collimation and a high spatial frequency reconstruction algorithm. CT is a key method in the identification and management of patients with ILD. It not only improves the detection and characterization of parenchymal abnormalities, but also increases the accuracy of diagnosis. The spectrum of morphologic characteristics that are indicative of interstitial lung disease is relatively limited and includes the linear and reticular pattern, the nodular pattern, the increased attenuation pattern (such as ground-glass opacities and consolidation), and the low attenuation pattern (such as emphysema and cystic lung diseases). In the correct clinical context, some patterns or combination of patterns, together with the anatomic distribution of the abnormality, i.e., from the lung apex to the base, or peripheral subpleural versus central bronchovascular, can lead the interpreter to a specific diagnosis. However, due to an overlap of the CT morphology between the various entities, the final diagnosis of many ILD requires close cooperation between clinicians and radiologists and complementary lung biopsy is recommended in many cases.",

A central bronchovascular bundle, consisting of the lobular bronchiole and the accompanying pulmonary artery, enters the center of the SPL, where the bronchiole bifurcates into three to five terminal bronchioles. The region near the origin of the terminal bronchioles is termed the \u201ccentrilobular\u201d region.

However, lobular bronchioles are rarely seen in normal individuals since their lumen measures approximately 1 mm in diameter, and their wall 0.15 mm, respectively. Likewise, the more peripheral terminal and respiratory bronchioles cannot be resolved at CT (Murata et al. 1986). It is only in diseases of the small airways that abnormal bronchi can be visualized through thickened walls, peribronchiolar inflammation, and/or intrabronchiolar fluid and mucus accumulations. Centrilobular arteries can be depicted at CT scans of normal and diseased individuals.

These structures are too small to be directly visualized on thin-section CT, but may be indirectly assessed as they are responsible for the background density of the lung on CT scans. Parenchymal background density reflects the proportions of fluid (blood and extravascular fluid), gas, and tissue. When ILD causes an increase of fluid or cells within the alveoli, or thickening of the alveolar septa through cellular infiltration or fibrosis, then parenchymal background density will change in turn and ground-glass opacities may be identified at CT. Conversely, a decrease in fluid, cells, and tissue (in relation to air), as seen in emphysema, causes a reduction of the parenchymal density, in comparison to the normal state. The thickening of the intralobular interstitium and the interlobular septa by fibrosis or infiltration leads to a reticular pattern.",

This technique uses a \u201cstep-and-shoot\u201d or \u201cspaced\u201d approach, in which thin sections with 0.5\u20131.5 mm thickness scans are obtained at 10\u201320 mm intervals. The large gaps between the sections considerably lower the radiation dose applied and allows for increasing the dose for each of the thin sections. Therefore, each of these sections offers a very good image quality with low noise and high spatial resolution. This high quality comes along with the disadvantage of a discontinuous CT data set with 10\u201320 mm gaps between the sections hampering the ability for exact comparison to prior examinations if the images are not perfectly aligned in z-direction. This \u201cclassic\u201d HRCT technique still plays a\ndecisive\nrole in the noninvasive investigation of patients with pulmonary disease of a diffuse distribution pattern (Hansell 2001).",

In addition to visualize diffuse structural changes of the lung parenchyma it adds the ability to detect and interpret sparsely distributed abnormalities of the lung parenchyma as well as focal disease which might have been missed using the classic spaced HRCT approach due to the gaps between the sections. The resulting volumetric, near isotropic data sets also permit the reconstruction of high quality multiplanar images which enable for better recognition of the distribution of disease, for example, to identify and rate a possible apico-basal gradient in the lung.

Patients with NSIP are usually between 40 and 50 years old, and men and women are equally affected. Compared to IPF, patients with NSIP have a variable, but overall more favorable, course of disease and the majority of patients stabilize or improve on corticosteroid therapy. According to the predominance of either inflammatory cells or fibrosis, NSIP is histologically subdivided into a cellular and a fibrotic subtype. Cellular NSIP is less common than fibrotic NSIP and carries a substantially better prognosis (Travis et al. 2000). On HRCT, NSIP is characterized by patchy ground-glass opacities combined with irregular linear or reticular opacities (Johkoh et al. 2002) (Fig. 7a, b). In fibrotic NSIP traction bronchiectasis become more evident and honeycombing may be present, but is typically limited in severity and extent. It has also been referred to as microcystic honeycombing (Desai et al. 2004). In contrast to the heterogeneous lung involvement and the typical apico-basal gradient in UIP, HRCT in NSIP reveals rather symmetric and homogeneous lung involvement without an obvious gradient (Fig. 8). The relative sparing of the immediate subpleural space is highly predictive of NSIP and present in 20\u201350% of cases (Fig. 9).\n\n\n",

There is no gender predilection. Patients usually present between 50 and 60 years of age, and typically report a respiratory tract infection preceding their symptoms. In its idiopathic form (as COP), OP is rare; however, it is frequently encountered in association with collagen vascular diseases, and in infectious and drug-induced lung diseases (Cordier 2000). On corticosteroid therapy, patient usually experience complete recovery, but relapses are common. The histologic hallmark of COP is the development of granulation tissue polyps within the alveolar ducts and alveoli, with preservation of the lung architecture. On HRCT, COP is characterized by patchy peripheral or peribronchial consolidations that resemble pneumonic infiltrates and predominate in the lower lung lobes (Lee et al. 1994) (Fig. 10a, b). Frequently, air bronchograms and perifocal ground-glass opacities can be found. Other common findings include sparing of the outermost subpleural area and mild cylindrical bronchiectasis. The reverse halo sign (atoll sign) is considered to be highly specific, although only seen in 20% of patients with COP. It is characterized by central ground-glass opacity surrounded by a ring or partial ring of consolidation. In addition to these typical CT features, other less specific findings can be encountered, such as irregular linear opacities, solitary focal lesions, and multiple nodules (Akira et al. 1998).\n",

LIP is more common in women than in men, and typically, patients become symptomatic in the fifth decade of life. Histologically, LIP is characterized by diffuse interstitial cellular infiltrates that are composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes. While the interstitium is expanded by these infiltrates, the alveolar airspaces are partially collapsed. The HRCT findings of LIP consist of bilateral, diffuse, or patchy ground-glass opacities, poorly defined centrilobular nodules, and cystic airspaces. The combination of diffuse ground-glass opacities and thickening of the interlobular septa results in the crazy paving pattern (Fig. 13).

Most patients present with cough and dyspnea; sometimes additional systemic symptoms, such as fatigue, weight loss, and fever, are reported. Smoking cessation is the most important component in the therapeutic management of PLCH, with stabilization or regression of clinical and radiographic features in the majority of patients. CT is very sensitive for the detection of PLCH and a correct diagnosis can be achieved in over 80% of cases (Grenier et al. 1991). On CT, PLCH is characterized by a combination of small nodules (1\u201310 mm) and cysts. The cysts are thought to arise by cavitation of the nodules, have a variable wall thickness, and are often irregularly outlined (Abbott et al. 2004) (Fig. 18a). Usually, the lung abnormalities are most prominent in the upper lobes, with relative sparing of the lung bases near the costophrenic sulci (Fig. 18b). In later phases of the disease, nodules are less obvious and cysts are the predominant feature. In this setting, PLCH may mimic lymphangioleiomyomatosis, but the latter occurs almost exclusively in women, affects the lung diffusively without sparing of the lung bases, and is characterized by uniformly sized cysts.\n",

The most common diseases are farmer\u2019s lung and bird fancier\u2019s lung due to aspergillus antigen and avian proteins, respectively. Based on the length and intensity of exposure and subsequent duration of illness, clinical presentations of HP are categorized as acute, subacute, and chronic progressive. In acute HP, patients present 4\u201312 h following heavy exposure to an inciting agent with fever, chills, and myalgias. In subacute and chronic HP, patients have an insidious onset of cough, progressive dyspnea, fatigue, and weight loss. HRCT in acute HP typically shows diffuse ground-glass opacities and centrilobular nodules, most commonly in a random distribution (Tomiyama et al. 2000). However, due to the short duration of symptoms patients rarely undergo CT scanning in the acute phase. In the subacute phase, centrilobular nodules become more prominent and patchy ground-glass opacities can be found. In some patients cystic lesions (3\u201325 mm) have been observed (Franquet et al. 2003). Chronic HP is characterized by the presence of reticulation due to fibrosis superimposed on findings of subacute HP (Fig. 24). The abnormalities are usually predominantly located in the upper lobes, while the lung bases are relatively spared (Silva et al. 2008). Other common findings in chronic HP include a mosaic attenuation pattern and air trapping on expiratory imaging (Small et al. 1996).\n",

The particles are engulfed by alveolar macrophages that release inflammatory cytokines and induce fibrotic changes. The classification of pneumoconiosis is based on chest radiographs using the International Labor Organization (ILO) classification scheme. The HRCT features in patients with silicosis and coal worker pneumoconiosis consist of small, well-circumscribed nodules that are usually 2\u20135 mm in diameter and predominantly affect the upper and posterior lung zones. The nodules have a perilymphatic distribution, thus affecting the interlobular septa and the peribronchovsacular and subpleural interstitium. The nodules in silicosis tend to be larger and better defined than those in coal worker pneumoconiosis (Kim et al. 2001). Occasionally, eggshell calcifications in the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are seen. The presence of nodules larger than 1 cm is indicative of complicated pneumoconiosis, also known as progressive massive fibrosis. These nodules coalesce and form conglomerate masses that are typically located in the upper lobe of the lung. In large lesions, cavitation may occur, which is due to either ischemic necrosis or superinfection. In advanced disease, hilar retraction and compensatory emphysema, particularly in the lower lobes, is seen (Fig. 25).\n",

The most common patterns of drug-induced lung disease include: pulmonary edema and hemorrhage; diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); organizing pneumonia (OP); nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP); hypersensitivity pneumonitis; and eosinophilic pneumonia. In early drug-induced DAD (1st week after lung injury), CT shows diffuse ground-glass opacities and consolidations, whereas, in the late phase of disease (after 1 or 2 weeks), fibrotic changes occur, such as irregular linear opacities, architectural distortion, and traction bronchiectasis. The HRCT manifestations of NSIP consist of scattered ground-glass opacities and irregular linear opacities (Fig. 26). The sparing of the outermost subpleural lung is highly suggestive of NSIP. HRCT findings in UIP include reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing. Drug-induced OP is identical to cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), and manifests on CT with bilateral areas of ground-glass opacities or consolidations that are often peripheral in distribution. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis usually becomes clinically apparent within hours or days after institution of drug therapy and HRCT findings are similar to those caused by inhalational agents (Rossi et al. 2000) with ground-glass opacities, centrilobular nodules, mosaic pattern and air trapping and Pulmonary involvement can result in either acute or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (EP). Drug toxicity is a common cause of eosinophilic pneumonia and is characterized by combined lung abnormality and increased serum or tissue eosinophils. HRCT in EP shows consolidation that are typically distributed peripherally and in the upper lobe. EP usually responds well to cessation of the administered drug and is exceedingly sensitive to corticosteroid therapy. Within the group of noncytotoxic drugs, methotrexate and amiodarone frequently cause drug-induced lung diseases in 5\u201310% of patients. The most common lung injury associated with both drugs is nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Organizing pneumonia is less commonly associated with noncytotoxic drugs (Fig. 27).\n\n",

            "text": "Radiation-induced lung injury is subdivided clinically and radiologically into an early stage, characterized by acute radiation pneumonitis, and a late stage, characterized by chronic radiation fibrosis. The degree of radiation damage to normal tissue depends particularly on total dose and the fraction of that dose, irradiated volume, individual susceptibility, preexisting lung disease, and previous or concomitant therapy. Early radiation pneumonitis usually develops 1\u20133 months after the therapy, and the radiographic findings are typically confined to the field of radiation, resulting in a geometric shape of pulmonary opacities with a sharp demarcation line at noninvolved lung areas and disregard of anatomic boundaries. The earliest CT findings consist of subtle ground-glass opacities (Fig. 28). These hazy abnormalities can progress to patchy consolidations that sometimes also involve lung areas outside the field of radiation (Davis et al. 1992). Chronic radiation fibrosis evolves within 6\u201324 months after radiation therapy and develops continuously from the phase of acute pneumonitis. At CT, it is characterized by the presence of reticular opacities, architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and volume loss. The major differential diagnoses in radiation pneumonitis include infection, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, and recurrence of the original malignancy. Microbial infectious pneumonia is not usually confined to the field of irradiation and runs a more symptomatic clinical course than radiation pneumonitis. In lymphangitic carcinomatosis, the rapid worsening of radiographic abnormalities, with development of irregular, often nodular thickening of the interlobular septa and the bronchovascular bundles, pleural effusions, and diffuse spread to the lung, are the diagnostic clues.\n",

Interstitial lung disease is probably most prevalent in systemic sclerosis, but is also a common problem in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), mixed connective tissue disease, dermatomyositis/polymyositis (DMPM), or Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. Lung involvement less frequently occurs with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The parenchymal manifestations of collagen vascular diseases seen at CT closely resemble those found in idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) and can be classified using the same system. Although the proportions of interstitial pneumonias vary, the nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is the most frequently encountered pattern in patients with collagen vascular lung disease, especially in progressive systemic sclerosis (Fig. 29). In keeping with the IIPs, the NSIP pattern is characterized by subpleural reticular opacities and varying proportions of ground-glass opacities, while in patients with UIP, honeycombing and traction-bronchiectasis are the dominant abnormality. The predominance of the NSIP over the UIP pattern might explain the more favorable prognosis in patients with interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular diseases than in those with IIPs (Kim et al. 2002). Organizing pneumonia (OP) is more common in RA than in the other collagen vascular diseases and is characterized by patchy infiltrates in a peripheral distribution. Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) is a typical, but rare complication in Sj\u00f6gren syndrome in about 1% of patients during the course of their disease (Swigris et al. 2002), and HRCT findings include diffuse or patchy ground-glass opacities and thin-walled perivascular cysts (Fig. 30). In addition to the patterns of interstitial pneumonias, other parenchymal manifestations in collagen vascular diseases include alveolar hemorrhage, especially in patients with SLE, and necrobiotic nodules in patients with RA, which range in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters (Remy-Jardin et al. 1994), and are usually subpleural in distribution. The increased prevalence of malignant disorders complicating the course of some disorders such as DMPM makes volumetric CT protocols mandatory in the follow-up of these patients.\n\n",

DPH must be distinguished from localized pulmonary hemorrhage due to chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, malignancy, and infection. DPH can occur in association with many collagen vascular diseases, notably systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. Other rare causes of DPH include Goodpasture syndrome and idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis. CT is more sensitive than chest radiograph for the detection of pulmonary hemorrhage, and shows diffuse bilateral consolidation or ground-glass opacities in the acute phase (Marasco et al. 1993). In the subacute phase of DPH, multiple small nodules associated with patchy ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening have been observed (Fig. 31). In addition, in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis), multiple, frequently cavitating nodules and masses, ranging from 5 to 10 cm, can be seen.\n",
