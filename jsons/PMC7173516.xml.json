The core encloses the viral genome, consisting of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA. Each segment encodes for one protein, except segment 11 that encodes for two (Figure 162-1\n, Table 162-4\n). Six proteins (VP1\u2013VP4, VP6\u2013VP7) form the virion structure. The core is made of VP1, VP2 (its major constituent) and VP3; VP6 is the sole component of the inner capsid; and the outer capsid is composed of VP7 (90%) and VP4. VP4 forms the capsomers, spike-like structures that radiate from the inner to the outer capsid giving the virus its characteristic wheel-like appearance (rota = wheel). In addition, six nonstructural proteins (NSP1\u2013NSP6) are expressed in the infected cell and participate in the replicative cycle.6, 7\n",

The virus enters enterocytes either by direct membrane penetration or by receptor-mediated endocytosis.26 Intracellular Ca2+ levels trigger virus uncoating and RNA synthesis proceeds in the core of the virion, mediated by VP1.27, 28 RV proteins are synthesized utilizing the host cell translational machinery. The initial steps of virus replication occur in cytoplasmic inclusions. The viral subparticles bud through the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and become mature particles.

            "text": "Immunity against RVs is likely multifactorial; involving local (mucosal) and systemic (serum) antibodies as well as innate and cellular immunity.33, 34 VP7 and VP4 induce serum-neutralizing antibodies against the infecting serotype (homotypic) that appear within 2 weeks of infection and correlate with protection.21 Heterotypic antibodies (those against different serotypes) also occur, but mainly among adults and are dependent on the infecting strain. Homotypic protection lasts longer than heterotypic protection but is incomplete and short lived.21 Anti-RV antibody levels are high at birth (transplacentally acquired), decline by 3\u20136 months, rise to a peak at 2\u20133 years and remain elevated throughout life (probably because of repeated, mostly asymptomatic infections).35 Serum antibodies do not always prevent infection, pointing to the potential role of mucosal immunity. For example, IgA deficient mice shed RV for a prolonged time and are not protected against reinfection.31 Furthermore, mucosal immunity, passively acquired by breast-feeding36 or by orally administered immune globulins37 ameliorates RV symptoms. Mucosal immunity develops 4 weeks after infection and persists for several months, eventually decreasing with advancing age.38 Experimental and clinical data suggest a role for non-neutralizing anti-VP639, 40, 41 and other antibodies42 in protection against RV disease. Cell-mediated immunity also seems important. In mice, RV-specific cytotoxic T cells appear in the intestinal mucosa soon after infection, and mice with severe combined immunodeficiency are able to clear RV infection when reconstituted with CD8 T cells, despite their lack of antibodies against the virus.43 Lastly, the role of innate immunity is being explored.44\n",

            "text": "A typical CV (Norwalk virus) capsid is formed by 90 VP1 dimers with 90 arch-like protruding capsomers arranged in such a way as to leave 32 calices on the viral surface. The VP1 has two major domains: the shell (S) domain and the protruding (P) domain. The S domain forms the inner part of the capsid. It has 225 amino acids (aa), including aa 10-49 corresponding to the N terminal region of the protein (N subdomain), which faces the interior of the capsid. The P domain includes amino acids 226\u2013520 and is subdivided into subdomains P1 and P2. The P1 subdomain (aa 226\u2013278 and 406\u2013520) form the sides of the capsomers whereas the P2 subdomain (aa 279\u2013405) form the most protruding part of the capsomers' arch (Figure 162-2). Each virion has only one or two copies of the VP2 (~22\u201329 kDa). The VP2 function is not completely understood; it appears to interact with the genome RNA during virus replication.57 VP1 and VP2 self assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) without RNA participation. VP2 is not needed for VLPs assembly but is essential for infections in feline calicivirus. The VLPs are morphologically and antigenically similar to natural virions.58 The NoV has six nonstructural proteins with different functions: NSP 1/2 (p48), replication complex formation; NSP3 (NTPase), nucleoside triphosphatase/RNA helicase; NSP4 (p22), replication complex formation; NSP5 (VPg), genome linked protein involved in translation and replication; NSP6 (3CL, Pro), protease; and NSP7 (Pol, RdRp), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. They play a role in the replication process of the genome RNA.57, 59\n",

            "text": "Norovirus infection starts when the protruding domain (P) of the VP1 binds specific carbohydrate receptors on the cell membrane; thereafter NoV enters the cell by a process that requires a protein receptor. This is followed by virus uncoating and release of VPg-linked RNA genome to the cytoplasm. Genome replication starts with a negative-sense RNA intermediate. This process is performed by NSP7 (RdRp). The genome functions as an mRNA for the first viral RNA translation, and becomes a template for a double-stranded replication form (RF). Thereafter positive-sense RNA synthesis begins. During the replication process, full genome and subgenomic RNA are formed. Subgenomic RNA consists of the last 2.4 kb of the genome (ORF2+ORF3), and it is also attached to VPg. The ORF1 generates the polyprotein that after cleavage produces the NSPs. NS1/2 and NS4 recruit cellular membranes to form a replication complex. Both VP1 and VP2 capsid proteins are translated mainly by subgenomic RNA. VP1 self-assembles to form the capsid or VLP. Nevertheless VP2 is required for infectivity. The mechanisms of viral assembly and release of the virions are poorly understood; apoptosis has been proposed as an exit strategy. It is assumed that HuNoV replication occurs in the epithelial cells of the upper gastrointestinal tract; however, no viral particles have been observed by EM of the jejunum mucosa59, 90 (Figure 162-3\n).",

(6) The ORF1 polyprotein is co- and post-translationally cleaved by the viral protease NS6. (7) The replication complex is formed by recruitment of cellular membranes to the perinuclear region of the cell (not shown), through interactions in part with NS1/2 and NS4. (8) Genome replication occurs via a negative-strand intermediate, and genomic and subgenomic RNA are generated by the viral RdRp (NS7), using both de novo and VPg-dependent mechanisms of RNA synthesis.
