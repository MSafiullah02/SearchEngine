Although patent races have received considerable attention in the economic literature, the strategic use of publications in innovation races has not. This paper focuses on one important reason for public disclosure of research results: defensive publication. Publishing details of their research findings, firms establish new prior art and thus strategically affect the patentability of related innovations. Firms can use publications to defend their own inventions from being patented by another company and to increase their probability of leapfrogging the leader and winning the race.",

Detailed technical disclosures may reveal information to rivals without providing the publishing firm intellectual property rights. Interestingly we find that firms' strategic behavior involves publications that disclose research findings. The main novelty of this paper is in identifying a role for publications in a dynamic R&D model. Importantly, and in contrast to most previous economic models of R&D races, in this paper, the state of the prior art is endogenous.\n1\n A firm's progress is compared not only to its rival's progress but also to the state of the prior art.",

Many leading companies publish research disclosures.\n5\n, Baker and Mezzetti (2005) in a case study of IBM's disclosures, find that approximately one out of six patents issued to IBM cite as prior art at least one article from the IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin and most of these patents cite articles published less than 5 years earlier. They interpret this finding as evidence that IBM is often disclosing information about patents that it is actively pursuing.\n6\n Note that during this same time (1996\u20132001) more than 75% of the patents that cited IBM's Bulletin were patents assigned to other companies (e.g. Apple Computers, Compaq Computer Corporation, Intel, Hewlett\u2010Packard, Sun Microsystems, Texas Instruments) indicating that these disclosures were also relevant to their competitors' research.\n7\n\n",

In 1992 AGFA published in the journal Research Disclosure a disclosure titled: \u201cA Lithographic Printing Plate.\u201d\n8\n In 1997 Kodak filed for a utility patent titled \u201cDirect write lithographic printing plates,\u201d which provides a prior art reference to AGFA's disclosure.\n9\n In 1995, AGFA itself also filed for a related patent citing the same disclosure.\n10\n The model provides a possible explanation for AGFA's publication. The companies engaged in closely related research. If AGFA suspected that Kodak may be close to patenting the technology, publishing could have forestalled it and thus was worthwhile even though AGFA intended to continue pursuing a patent.\n11\n\n",

In the model two firms are engaged in a multistage patent race. To win the race, a firm needs to be the first to accomplish n discrete steps above the prevailing prior art. The winner of the race enjoys a prize while the loser obtains no payoff but incurs the loss of its R&D investment. Publication alters the state of the prior art so that more innovation steps are required. It sets back both competitors relative to their goal of advancing n steps above the state of the prior art. In other words, the race that we consider has no fixed finish line. Firms' progress and the state of the prior art are observed. There is uncertainty with respect to R&D, which is modeled as a Poisson process. To emphasize the defensive purpose of research disclosure, publications are assumed to have no direct payoff, and firms do not possess market power over an innovation once it is made public.",

Because publishing prolongs the race and delays the prize, the follower will want to wait for as long as possible before publishing. By doing so the follower avoids unnecessary publications in the event he makes favorable progress in R&D. For the same reason, the follower will choose to publish the least possible to prevent the competitor from winning, and will do so only when he is far enough behind.

However, as the authors note, since the laggard lacks intellectual property rights on the disclosed information this value is likely to be very limited, leaving the laggard little incentive to publish.

In Baker and Mezzetti a race between firms M and N takes place in three periods. In period 1, only firm M can conduct research and disclose. In period 2, only firm N can conduct research and disclose, and in the final period, only firm M moves again. Throughout period 2, in which firm N conducts research, obtains results, and decides on disclosure, its rival cannot act. In particular, regardless of how close firm M is to the finish line, its probability of winning in period 2 is zero. Thus, their results are most applicable for situations in which a firm has achieved some nonpatentable progress but expects a delay before it can begin pursuing the next milestone.
