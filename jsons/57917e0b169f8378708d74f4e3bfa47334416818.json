In Europe, the situation varies from country to country, but in general the prevalence of resistant strains is not higher than 10%. 5, 6 The administration of ciprofloxacin as a second line antibiotic in paediatric cases of serious infection with subsequent failure of clarithromycin treatment has proved to be a valid strategy for clinical management. 7 Multiple locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) is a molecular method based on the sequencing of 5 selected loci; this technique can better discriminate between different strains of M pneumoniae than other typing methods and is therefore a useful tool for assessing relationships between cases during an outbreak. 8, 9 Here, MLVA and P1 adhesion protein typing revealed the clonal spread of a unique strain of macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae (MR-MP) within a single family in Italy.",

In the 11-day period prior to hospitalization, she suffered from a dry cough and fever (39.58C) accompanied by malaise. She received clarithromycin (prescribed by the family paediatrician) from the second day of symptom onset. She was severely ill upon admission, with a high temperature, dyspnoea, and an increased respiratory rate. Routine blood tests revealed neutrophilia, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and increased C-reactive protein levels. Auscultation revealed diffuse crackles with reduced vesicular sounds on the right lung, and chest radiography showed a right middle lobe infiltrate. Blood, nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), and sputum samples were collected for serological tests and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of bacterial agents (i.e., those responsible for community-acquired pneumonia) and respiratory viruses. The girl received nebulized albuterol and clarithromycin (15 mg/kg/day, in 2 oral doses). Microbiological tests were negative for respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and coronaviruses) and negative for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Moraxella catharralis. However, PCR identified NPS and sputum samples as positive for M pneumoniae DNA. Serological tests were positive for anti-M pneumoniae IgM antibodies, but negative for anti-M pneumoniae IgG antibodies.",

The presence of the same MLVA type and P1 subtype provides evidence of the clonal spread of a unique strain of M pneumoniae among several members of the same family. Based on these findings, we can hypothesize that the index case transmitted the MR-MP infection to her cousin (the 7-year-old male), mother, and twin siblings. The 7-year-old cousin probably transmitted the infection to his 3-year-old sister, who subsequently developed bronchitis. However, it is difficult to explain the presence of a macrolide-susceptible strain of M pneumoniae in samples from the index case's aunt, despite the finding that the strain had the same MLVA type and P1 subtype as those of strains identified in other family members. We speculate that the aunt was infected or colonized by a macrolide-susceptible M pneumoniae strain in December 2014, and that she transmitted this strain to her niece (the index case); the strain then developed resistance to macrolides following treatment with clarithromycin. The index case then transmitted the infection to her 7-yearold cousin. All other cases were infected subsequent to this. Carriage may be supposed in the case of the grandmother, since she was asymptomatic.",

Taken together, the findings reported in these previous studies may help to explain the cluster of infection/carriage within a single family.",

This, to the best of our knowledge, is novel since carriage of M pneumoniae DNA has been reported only in subjects infected by strains who are susceptible to macrolides; 8 to date, there are no reports describing carriage of macrolide-resistant strains. In conclusion, this study reports the spread of a unique clonal MR-MP strain within a single family in Italy. The presence of macrolide-resistant strains in the pharyngeal tracts of asymptomatic family members highlights the potential for such subjects to spread macrolide-resistant strains in the community. These findings underline the need for routine identification of MR-MP and increased awareness among clinicians regarding such occurrences. Finally, increasing resistance to macrolides means that novel strategies for treating and preventing M pneumoniae infections should be considered.",
