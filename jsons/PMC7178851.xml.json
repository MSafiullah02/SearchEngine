The child with septic shock may have simultaneous derangements in the function of virtually every system of the body including: cardiovascular, respiratory, immune, renal, coagulation, hepatic, metabolic and neurologic. The degree to which physiologic alterations are manifest in a given patient is variable and influenced by multiple host and non-host factors including: the developmental stage, the presence of co-morbidities, pathogen-related factors, and genetic influences on both the host inflammatory response as well as the response to pharmacologic agents, all combining to have a profound influence on outcome. The clinician must possess a systematic and multifaceted approach to these critically ill patients. The goal of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive description of the epidemiology, biology and pathophysiology (at both the cellular and organ level) of sepsis, as well as outlining the current principles of managing septic shock. It will be apparent that optimal management requires a strong working knowledge of cardiovascular physiology, infectious diseases, multiple organ interactions, immunity, coagulation, pharmacology, and the molecular biology of inflammation.",

It has only been in the 1990s that consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock were achieved. It was hoped that the development of standard definitions would not only enable accurate characterization of the epidemiology of sepsis, but also serve to stratify patients early in the course of sepsis for the purpose of clinical studies aimed at testing novel therapies. The most widely used definition of pediatric sepsis/septic shock is based on the 1992 American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine (ACCP/SCCM) Consensus Conference, with adaptations for the pediatric population. The following four definitions resulted from these discussions: SIRS, sepsis, septic shock, and severe sepsis. Although there is overlap between some of these terms (particularly between septic shock and severe sepsis), each is intended to define a particular patient population.",

As a result, this physiologic response was defined as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS defines a state of inflammation/immune activation in a child and is based on the presence of at least two of the four criteria listed in Table 27-1. Thus, patients with diverse clinical conditions such as sepsis, pancreatitis, burns, or severe trauma can meet criteria for SIRS. It has been argued that the SIRS definition is non-specific and that too broad a range of patients are ultimately classified as having SIRS. Nevertheless, the criteria have been widely used in both prescriptive and interventional studies to enhance the \u201ccapture\u201d of all patients at risk for the subsequent development of severe sepsis or septic shock.\n\nSIRS is a state of inflammatory/immune activation and is based on the presence of at least two of the four following clinical criteria: Temperature >38\u00b0C or <36\u00b0C, heart rate >90th percentile for age, respiratory rate >90th percentile for age, or hyperventilation to PaCO2  <  32 mm Hg.

            "text": "One traditional classification of shock states divides this clinical state into three broad categories: hypovolemic, cardiogenic and distributive shock. The shock associated with sepsis is unique in that all three forms are likely to be present. Hypovolemic shock results from capillary leak, increased insensible losses, and decreased effective blood volume secondary to venodilation. Cardiogenic shock is related to direct myocardial depression, the cause(s) of which remains the focus of investigation. Finally, distributive shock is often apparent as brisk capillary refill, widened pulse pressure and bounding peripheral pulses and is caused by abnormally decreased systemic vascular resistance from pathologic vasodilation. The particular pattern of these hemodynamic physiologic perturbations manifested by any individual patient can be variable. Some children have increased cardiac output with diminished systemic vascular resistance characteristic of distributive shock or the so-called \u201cwarm\u201d shock state. In stark contrast to adults, in which this hemodynamic profile (increased cardiac output/decreased systemic vascular resistance) is most common, children more frequently present with depressed cardiac output and elevated systemic vascular resistance. These patients appear cool with diminished pulses and poor capillary refill that is characteristic of the \u201ccold\u201d shock state. While important to recognize that patients may transition from one state to another, the presence of hypotension is often a late and particularly ominous sign that requires prompt intervention as its presence is associated with increased mortality.\nChildren with sepsis may have hemodynamic characteristics that transcend traditional classification. They often have elements of hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction and abnormal vascular tone.\n",

Chest x-ray findings can reveal a small heart in the presence of hypovolemia with few vascular markings. Alternatively, the combination of capillary leak, decreased myocardial function and the result of fluid resuscitation in some children with sepsis can result in pulmonary edema. Rapid progression to acute respiratory failure from ARDS is not uncommon. All organ systems and ultimately cellular functions are affected by poor perfusion and decreased oxygen delivery related to depressed cardiac and respiratory function. In addition, there may be direct injurious effects of bacterial toxins and circulating cytokines such as triggering of programmed cell death or apoptosis. The neurologic state of a child with sepsis is frequently altered and can range from agitation or irritability to frank obtundation. This depressed mental status can be present even in the absence of meningitis as a manifestation of cerebral hypoperfusion. Skin manifestations are not uncommon and can include petechiae and purpura that are ominous signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and purpura fulminans secondary to meningococcemia. Diffuse erythema secondary to toxic shock syndromes can be present. There is also an increasing appreciation of sepsis-induced microvascular angiopathy contributing to distal skin and organ ischemia. An initial thorough and detailed physical exam provides both important clues to the diagnostic possibilities of pediatric septic shock and the underlying hemodynamic profile. However, serial exams are imperative to follow pathophysiologic changes and to gauge the impact of therapeutic interventions in reversing the manifestations of shock.\nIn the septic child, the combination of capillary leak, decreased myocardial function and the result of fluid resuscitation may result in rapid progression to acute respiratory failure.\n",

Historically, sepsis research has focused on the role of Gram-negative bacteria in evoking a pathologic response. The structure of endotoxin shows three domains: an outer polysaccharide hydrophilic chain which determines the O-antigenicity, an acidic core region, and a lipid-rich region. Gram-negative organisms possess endotoxins with variable repeats of mono- and heteropolysaccharides with complex side chain structure to provide a basis for distinct antigenicity. The O-region is linked via an acidic core to the lipid A region that is highly conserved and responsible for much of the toxicity attributed to intact LPS.",

First, a strain of LPS-resistant mice, the C3H/HeJ strain, was identified and its resistance was found to be attributed to a single genetic mutation. Second, it was shown that the lethal effects of endotoxin could be conferred by transfer of hematopoietic cells. Endotoxin tolerant mice could be rendered \u00adLPS-sensitive after reconstitution with hematopoietic cells derived from the \u00admonocyte/macrophage lineage from an LPS-sensitive strain. Third, stimulation of monocyte-derived cells with endotoxin resulted in production of several cytokines and chemokines critical to the systemic inflammatory response. Among these, TNF and IL-1 were shown to be critical initiators of the septic response and could in fact mimic the endotoxin response.

However, it lacked a transmembrane extension required for cytoplasmic signaling indicating the presence of additional components of the receptor complex. Investigators working with Drosophila had identified a gene, Toll, which was responsible for dorsoventral polarization in embryonic development. When Toll was functionally mutated, it was demonstrated to play a key role in host defense against Aspergillus fumigatus. Homology between the Toll-like receptors and the mammalian IL-1 family of receptors was discovered and provided additional evidence that this family was crucial to the human innate immune response. Finally, it was determined that the C3H/HeJ mouse strain which is hyporesponsive to LPS possessed a mutation in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), providing further evidence that this receptor was necessary for LPS signaling. TLR4 is one of ten mammalian Toll-like receptors that have been cloned to date, each being activated by a specific set of ligands. Since these discoveries, other members of the LPS-receptor complex have been elucidated and include both MD-2 and MyD88. It is also known that circulating LPS-binding protein (LBP) facilitates LPS binding to the cell surface receptor complex. Together these components are able to \u201csense\u201d LPS at the cell surface and transmit this signal via a series of complex pathways.

Among these, the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03ba\u03b2) and the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways play a prominent role in regulating the expression of a number of inflammatory gene products key to propagating the sepsis response. In the case of NF-\u03baB, stimulation of the LPS receptor causes phosphorylation of the Inhibitor of \u03baB Kinases (I\u03baK) which in turn phosphorylates the intracellular inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, I kappa B (I\u03baB). Upon phosphorylation, I\u03baB undergoes poly-ubiquination followed by proteosomal degradation. The removal of I\u03baB effectively unmasks a nuclear translocation sequence on NF-\u03baB enabling it to proceed into the nucleus to bind to NF-\u03baB consensus sequences present on the promoter regions of many inflammatory genes: cytokines including TNF, chemokines including IL-8, adhesion molecules including E-selectin and others such as iNOS (see Fig. 27-1). The role of NF-\u03baB in sepsis is supported by studies demonstrating that survivors and non-survivors of sepsis are distinguishable on the basis of NF-\u03baB binding activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, in sepsis-induced ARDS, increased activation of NF-\u03baB in macrophages obtained by BAL is found in ARDS patients when compared to ICU controls.\nNuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03ba\u03b2) and the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways play a prominent role in regulating the expression of a number of inflammatory gene products key to propagating the sepsis response.\n",

Evidence exists for the role of each of these signaling pathways in sepsis. TNF production by neutrophils and macrophages is dependent on p38 activation. LPS stimulation of monocytes activates JNK with downstream activation of activating protein-1 (AP-1) and subsequent IL-1\u03b2 production. LPS induction of TNF is in part dependent on ERK pathway activation.

IL-1\u03b2 which is secreted, mediates much of the systemic effects attributed to IL-1 release in sepsis. Synthesized as a propeptide, IL-1\u03b2 requires proteolytic cleavage by the IL-1 converting enzyme (ICE) to become bioactive. IL-1\u03b2 utilizes the 80-kDa type I receptor which is associated with a number of adapter proteins (e.g. MyD88,TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)) to propagate signals through both the NF-\u03baB and AP-1 pathways. IL-1\u03b2 infusion elicits fever, hypotension and leukocytic infiltration to the lungs. In a manner similar to TNF, IL-1 stimulates monocyte activation and phagocytosis, increases adhesion molecule expression, and increases tissue factor expression while inhibiting thrombomodulin secretion, thus creating a procoagulant state. When detected in the circulation of septic patients, IL-1 levels also correlate with mortality. Of note, the IL-1Ra is a circulating inhibitor of IL-1\u03b2 that binds to the IL-1 receptor without initiating a signal. The expression of IL-1Ra has been shown to follow peak expression of IL-1. It is speculated that IL-1Ra is an endogenous regulator of IL-1 effects. However, in clinical trials, IL-1Ra infusion failed to improve mortality in sepsis.",

Similar findings of an attenuated response to pathogen stimulation have now been reported in patients with mutations in both the TLR4 and TLR2 gene.

The primary goals of therapy in those initial hours following clinical presentation are to maintain oxygenation and ventilation, achieve normal perfusion and blood pressure, and re-establish appropriate urine output for age. Children with sepsis may have altered mental status which, if profound, raises concern about the ability to protect the airway. Tachypnea associated with a primary or compensatory respiratory alkalosis is commonly present. The combination of increased lung vascular permeability and aggressive fluid resuscitation to restore intravascular volume and maintain blood pressure may contribute to the subsequent development of pulmonary edema. In children with lung edema, the related changes in lung compliance and loss of functional residual capacity can dramatically increase the work of breathing ultimately necessitating tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilatory support. Arterial blood gas analysis may show hypoxemia and metabolic acidosis; however, the decision to provide mechanical ventilatory support should not be based solely on laboratory findings. The presence of increased work of breathing, hypoventilation or obtundation are all indications for instituting mechanical ventilatory support which holds additional benefit in decreasing the overall oxygen consumption, especially when combined with sedation and paralysis. It should be stated, however, that children with warm shock can commonly be managed without endotracheal intubation so long as they are not obtunded or fluid overloaded. Disorientation or lethargy with intact responsiveness does not require placement of an artificial airway as many institutions manage these patients without intubation. The work of breathing associated with hyperventilation in the absence of pulmonary edema is not clinically significant. Furthermore, there is no evidence that decreasing work of breathing in the presence of distributive shock will result in redistribution of nutrient flow to vital organs, the very nature of distributive shock. However, it is more common for infants to present with cardiac dysfunction and pulmonary edema or seriously altered mental status requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Correction of intravascular volume depletion should be made prior to the institution of positive pressure ventilation. The decrease in venous return after the initiation of positive pressure ventilation may lead to further hemodynamic compromise in the child with intravascular volume depletion. Caution should also be taken in choosing sedative agents for intubation, using agents that have the least impact on tenuous hemodynamics (e.g. ketamine). Controversy exists over the adrenal suppressive effect of a single dose of etomidate when used for intubation in septic children and adults. The pediatric critical care clinician should be aware of the concern for adrenal suppression following a single dose of etomidate used for the intubation of children with septic shock and the published guidelines which do NOT recommend its use in this setting. Following intubation, attention must be paid to matching the mechanically provided minute ventilation to that which was present during spontaneous respiratory effort so that respiratory compensation of acidemia is preserved. If it is deemed that positive pressure ventilation is not needed, supplemental oxygen should be provided to maintain normal oxygen saturations.",

However, consensus guidelines recommend that vasoactive infusions may be necessary in some cases to sustain perfusion pressure even when hypovolemia is not yet resolved. Dopamine is the most common first choice agent selected for hemodynamic support in those patients with fluid-refractory shock. Dopamine provides inotropic support at lower concentrations; however, it is often necessary to increase it to higher doses that provide vasopressor activity (up to 20 \u03bcg/kg/min) to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. The decision of which agent to add in the setting of dopamine-refractory shock should be based on the underlying cause of cardiovascular compromise. For example, if hemodynamic instability is related to low cardiac output from direct cardio-depressant effects then increased inotropy from dobutamine or low-dose epinephrine may be indicated. If hypotension persists secondary to decreased vascular tone, then agents such as epinephrine and norepinephrine dosed in the alpha agonist range should be considered.

These catheters can be useful for following the central venous pressure (CVP) during fluid administration. Finally, when the tip is located in the superior vena cava, blood sampling can provide an approximate measure of the mixed venous oxygen saturation which has been validated as a critical target in adult shock resuscitation. The decision regarding the access site for a central venous catheter is dictated by a number of mitigating factors such as the experience level of the operator and the presence of coagulopathy. Femoral catheters, in the absence of abdominal pathology, can be used to estimate CVP with good correlation. The CVP measured in the abdominal inferior vena cava must be assessed carefully as a low CVP can be a reliable indicator of hypovolemia, however, a normal or high CVP in the presence of abdominal distention does not automatically exclude the presence of hypovolemia. Multiple adult studies have demonstrated that even an accurate intra-thoracic CVP may be a poor approximation of left ventricular end diastolic pressure and volume. The CVP can be elevated despite the presence of hypovolemia if pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction with poor diastolic compliance, tricuspid regurgitation, cardiac tamponade or an intracardiac left-to-right shunt exists. Even though precise determination of the true mixed venous saturation requires the presence of a pulmonary artery catheter, the approximations derived from the SVC saturation have proven a useful target in septic adults.

Caveats to interpretation of PAC data include the presence of an intracardiac shunt and an abnormally functioning mitral valve or other obstructed left heart lesion as either shunting, regurgitation, or inaccurate pressure determinations will alter cardiac index and/or the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure measurements. As previous data in adults have shown no benefit of PAC use, a recent consensus statement regarding their use stated that the role of PAC remains unclear. Studies of children with septic shock have shown that the information obtained from a PAC aided in identifying hemodynamic profiles different from those presumed by care givers and has directly influenced care decisions. It was concluded by a recent consensus panel to be of potential benefit in improving the management of pediatric patients. Pulmonary artery catheter placement should be considered for pediatric patients who remain in shock after resuscitation and initiation of the usual vasoactive agents in whom the fluid status and cardiac function remains unclear. In this setting, therapeutic endpoints are a cardiac index of >3.3 and <6.0 L/min/M2 and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances within the normal range.",

Prompt initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy against the causative pathogen has been shown to be one of the most important predictors of outcome. In a 1980\u2019s study of over 1,100 adults, providing appropriate antimicrobial coverage at least 1 day prior to identification of the organism was associated with improved survival. The pathogen itself has prognostic significance. Fungal infections, while accounting for only a minority of sepsis cases, carry the lowest survival rate, followed by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Survival rate has been reported to be the highest in patients in whom no pathogen was identified.",

            "text": "Because of the importance of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, the decision of which agents to empirically start must balance potential side effects versus maximizing coverage. In this respect, it is important to be familiar not only with the most common causative pathogens, but also the local ICU nosocomial risks and pathogen resistance patterns. Initially, broad antibiotic coverage is initiated. Neonates are most frequently placed on ampicillin and an aminoglycoside (e.g. gentamicin) or a third generation cephalosporin such as cefotaxime. In infants and children over the age of 4\u20136 weeks, the decision to start vancomycin empirically should be considered in light of the increasing antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus Pneumoniae and rising incidence of community acquired Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA). In addition, a 3rd or 4th generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftriaxone) should be used. Suspicion of a Gram-negative infection or nosocomial infection requires additional coverage, usually in the form of an aminoglycoside, for the possibility of Pseudmonas species and other resistant Gram-negative organisms. Because of its broad coverage, including many anaerobic species, and low renal toxicity, piperacillin/tazobactam is empirically administered with increasing frequency. The antiviral agent, acyclovir, should be administered if there is suspicion of a herpes virus infection. In immunocompetent children, the decision to start empiric antifungal therapy remains controversial. In the child who is not improving over the initial days of empiric coverage or in whom there is a higher risk for fungal infection (e.g. presence of indwelling devices, immunosuppression or other significant co-morbidities), antifungal coverage may be indicated. The development of agents equally as effective as amphotericin, but with substantially reduced nephrotoxicity such as fluconazole and caspofungin, may ultimately sway the risk/benefit analysis towards more aggressive, earlier initiation of empiric antifungal coverage in select, high risk populations. The ability to narrow the spectrum of treatment once the causative organism has been identified will reduce the number of potential side effects and curtail the development of pathogen resistance related to imprudent use of broad spectrum antibiotics.",

            "text": "The current mainstay of supportive care in sepsis remains the maintenance of adequate oxygen delivery in the face of myocardial depression, capillary leak, acidosis, and massive cytokine release. While some early adult studies have suggested improved outcomes when achieving supra-normal levels of oxygen delivery, this approach in pediatric sepsis remains unproven. This is likely due to the fact that septic patients may have a perturbed ability to extract oxygen in addition to suboptimal oxygen delivery. Clinically, this impairment in cellular oxygen uptake may be reflected by an inappropriately high central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) in the face of a progressive and therapy refractory acidosis. Optimizing appropriate oxygen delivery remains a clinical goal and incorporates the need for maximizing oxygen carrying capacity. While there is no recommended hemoglobin level for children, the most recent NIH consensus conference suggested a hemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dL for adults with cardiopulmonary compromise as part of a protocol toward achieving the therapeutic goal of ScvO2 >70%, with improved outcomes demonstrated when this goal was achieved during initial resuscitation. In the context of fluid loading with blood transfusion, empiric administration of diuretics to eliminate extra fluid should be avoided until hemodynamic stability has been achieved or if the child exhibits signs of intravascular volume overload defined earlier in this chapter. Similar clinical parameters can be assessed in response to blood transfusion. Perhaps the best assessments are determinations that provide indirect evidence of the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption such as lactate levels and mixed venous oxygen saturation.\nIn the context of fluid loading with blood transfusion, empiric administration of diuretics to eliminate extra fluid should be avoided until hemodynamic stability has been achieved or if the child exhibits signs of intravascular volume overload.\n",

Patients with sepsis often have poor nutrition prior to admission to the PICU and often may not be fed in the first few days of illness. This state combined with the increased metabolic rate associated with sepsis place the septic patient at risk for protein calorie malnutrition. Intestinal hypoperfusion in combination with absence of local enterocyte nutrition can cause mucosal barrier dysfunction and may contribute to translocation of bacteria and endotoxin from the intestine into the blood stream. While the use of enteral feeding in critical illness has been shown to improve survival and decrease hospital stay, its use must be balanced with the risk of stressing intestinal function in the face of poor splanchnic perfusion, especially in the child requiring the use of vasopressors such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. Regardless of which mode of nutrition is chosen, the goal of achieving nitrogen balance is important for allowing recovery and return to physiologic homeostasis. In the absence of enteral feedings, protection from stress-related gastrointestinal ulcer formation is advised.",

            "text": "Because poor outcome in sepsis has been attributed to a dysregulated proinflammatory state, anti-inflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids, have long been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy. Anecdotally, it has been observed that some patients treated with antibiotics appear to acutely worsen in a time frame consistent with the onset of antibiotic activity. This observation has been attributed to massive release of bacterial products following the lysis of high numbers of bacteria. To this end, investigators had shown that animals treated with anti-inflammatory drugs prior to receiving antibiotics demonstrated a less severe response to bacterial lysis. Despite encouraging preclinical studies, two subsequent large adult trials using high dose steroids early in sepsis showed no improvement in mortality. More recently, studies using lower doses of steroids over a longer period of time have suggested a possible benefit including a reduced time to cessation of vasopressor therapy. These more recent observations have stimulated a resurgence in the use of corticosteroids in sepsis. Adrenal insufficiency is frequently unrecognized in children with septic shock and a low basal circulating cortisol level, especially in association with an abnormal corticotropin stimulation test, has been associated with higher mortality rates. Therefore, identifying \u201cat risk\u201d patients with a corticotropin stimulation test and treating this group may improve outcome in sepsis. A study in which adult septic shock patients who were classified as \u201cnon-responders\u201d based on corticotropin stimulation results were treated with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for 7 days and had a significantly reduced risk of death. However, this initial observation was not observed in larger follow-up studies. Thus, the use of hydrocortisone and the application of a corticotropin stimulation test in septic patients remains highly controversial. In pediatrics, it is currently recommended that any child with fluid- and catecholamine-refractory shock (inadequate response to two or more vasoactive agents), has a known history of adrenal insufficiency, or has previously received exogenous steroids should be considered for steroid replacement with hydrocortisone (usual dose between 50 and 100 mg/M2/day divided every 6 h).\nAdrenal insufficiency is frequently unrecognized in children with septic shock. A low basal circulating cortisol level, especially in association with an abnormal corticotropin stimulation test, has been associated with higher mortality rates.\n",

Case reports suggest that arterial oxygenation and hemodynamics can be improved with use of hemofiltration during sepsis and multiple organ failure. However, there exist many mitigating factors in evaluating the pediatric experience and the efficacy of hemofiltration remains unproven. Challenges with instituting extracorporeal hemofiltration include difficulty with vascular access in smaller children, potential fluid and electrolyte imbalance, hypothermia, anticoagulation requirements and acutely compromised hemodynamics during initiation. In addition, it is not known whether beneficial proteins such as albumin, immunoglobulins, clotting factors and counter-regulatory cytokines are removed during this process.

It is encouraging that administration of activated protein C in adults with septic shock was associated with a significant decrease in 28-day mortality. Though activated protein C should not be routinely used in pediatric sepsis, indications for its use may be determined from further trials in pediatric sepsis. In the meantime, many other potential immune modulating therapeutic agents have been identified and are currently under investigation. Unfortunately, many of the anti-inflammatory agents tried to date (anti-IL-1, anti-bradykinin, anti-endotoxin, anti-TNF-\u03b1, soluble TNF receptor and anti-platelet activating factor) have not shown any benefit in large, randomized clinical trials. It is hoped that improvements in study design which include thoughtful stratification of patients, timely identification of the presence or absence of a pathogen and consideration of genetic factors that influence outcome will eventually assist in discovering and targeting pharmacologic agents that ultimately improve the outcome of the pediatric patient with septic shock.",

With this approach, mortality in pediatric sepsis improved modestly over the past decades. However, the fact that over 4,000 children per year continue to die in association with severe sepsis argues that further advances be made.
