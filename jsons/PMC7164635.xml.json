With\nthe stabilization by B0AT1, we elucidated the structure of full-length ACE2.\nB0AT1 is not involved in dimerization, suggesting that ACE2 may be a homodimer\neven in the absence of B0AT1. Further examination suggests that a dimeric ACE2\ncan accommodate two S protein trimers, each through a monomer of ACE2 (fig. S9). The\ntrimeric structure of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 was recently reported, with one RBD in an\nup conformation and two in down conformations (PDB 6VSB) (14). The PD clashes with the rest of the S protein when the\nternary complex is aligned to the RBD of the down conformation. There is no clash when the\ncomplex is superimposed on RDB in the up conformation, with a RMSD of 0.98 \u00c5 over 126\npairs of C\u03b1 atoms, confirming that an up conformation of RDB is required\nto bind to the receptor (fig. S9) (14).",

The presence of B0AT1 may block the access of TMPRSS2\nto the cutting site on ACE2. The expression distribution of ACE2 is broader than that of\nB0AT1. In addition to kidneys and intestine, where B0AT1 is mainly\nexpressed, ACE2 is also expressed in lungs and heart (27). It remains to be tested whether B0AT1 can\nsuppress SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking ACE2 cleavage. Enteric infections have been\nreported for SARS-CoV, and possibly also for SARS-CoV-2 (36, 37). B0AT1 has also been shown to interact with another\ncoronavirus receptor, aminopeptidase N (APN or CD13) (38). These findings suggest that B0AT1 may play a\nregulatory role for the enteric infections of some coronaviruses.",
