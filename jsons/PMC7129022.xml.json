One Health is also prominent in several global commitments and political declarations such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the International Health Regulations, the Global Health Security Agenda, the UN Paris Agreement on climate change, and the UN Political Declaration on Antimicrobial Resistance. It forms the basis of the tripartite alliance of WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the International Organization for Animal Health.",

This neglect of the environment was also a key finding of the systematic analysis of One Health Networks (OHNs) reported by Mishal Khan and colleagues in The Lancet Planetary Health.3 The paper highlights to the funders of OHNs the importance of ensuring the equitable inclusion of the human, animal, and environmental sectors of the triad against a consensus definition of One Health to ensure a return on investment by transparent monitoring and evaluation of explicit One Health outputs, outcomes, and impact that improve the strategic direction, coordination and efficiencies of OHNs, locally, regionally and globally.",

Antibiotic resistance has been described as the \u201cquintessential One Health issue\u201d as it exists in all three sectors. The relative roles of the three sectors in the development, transmission, and persistence of antibiotic resistance are, however, poorly understood.4 Antibiotic resistance is a direct consequence of the selection pressure from warranted and indiscriminate antibiotic use in human and animal health5 and antibiotic exposure in the environment. Use of antibiotics in animal production systems at sub-therapeutic doses for prolonged periods creates optimal conditions for bacteria to entrench antibiotic resistance genes. These genes are subsequently transferred to human pathogens or commensals via humans, contaminated food, or the environment. Antibiotics used in humans and animals are frequently analogues of each other, which potentially drives the transmission of resistance between humans and animals, and there is growing evidence linking antibiotic consumption in livestock to antibiotic resistance in the clinic.4, 6 The burden of antibiotic resistance is least well understood in the environment. Environmental bacteria, which are quantitatively the most prevalent bacteria, serve as reservoirs of resistance genes that can become incorporated into human and animal pathogens over time. These resistance gene reservoirs are augmented by the influx of resistance genes from livestock and human waste into the environment. They are further augmented by the entry of antibiotic residues from pharmaceutical industries, intensive livestock farming, and hospitals, which disrupt the soil and water microflora in addition to exerting selection pressure for the development of resistance.4 The environment is subject to variable weather patterns, particularly fluctuations in temperature, humidity, and precipitation (not the least of which is as a result of climate change) that affect bacterial ecosystems, making the environment a vacillating sector in the One Health antibiotic resistance triad.",
