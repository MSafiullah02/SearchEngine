At present, guidelines recommend using 10-14 days of antibiotics for treating bronchiectasis exacerbations. Discussions between ourselves and respiratory physician colleagues, as well as feedback from parents, also revealed that 14-days was the longest period deemed acceptable for treating an exacerbation with a placebo with a safety exit at the 7-day mark. Consequently, the 14-day treatment course was chosen for our study protocol",

For the secondary clinical outcome (PC-QoL), pre and post-treatment data were missing for 37 patients, but we had paired data for 107 children to compare amoxicillin-clavulanate (n=53) to placebo (n=54) and azithromycin (n=53) to placebo (n=54). For other secondary outcomes, we analysed only the data that were available. Children who did not resolve or where the day to resolution was unknown were counted as treatment failures. We compared the between-group exacerbation duration (i.e. days to its resolution) only in the children where the exacerbation episode resolved. This was because children by day-14 who had not returned to their baseline state received open-label antibiotics.",

In the published protocol we had planned to report odds ratio and number-neededto-treat for benefit (NNT-B), but while doing the statistical analysis plan, we decided to use generalised linear regression to detect relative risk of resolution and report the same along with NNT-B. We decided to present relative risk rather than odds ratio to better align the results with the sample size calculation (which was formulated in terms of difference in risk between groups).The relative risk of resolution of the active medication compared to placebo was defined as significant if it was >1, the 95%CI did not cross 1 and the p-value was <0.0245.

The time (in days) to next exacerbation for each patient was collected individually from the day of resolution. The denominator used for this outcome was confined to children whose exacerbations had resolved within the 14-day period when the study medications were being received. This was because those whose exacerbations failed to resolve after 14-days of receiving the study medication were then prescribed open-label antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate) as per the study protocol. Including children treated with open-label antibiotics would therefore no longer represent the true effect of the study treatments, including the placebo medication. The children who did not have an exacerbation after the study intervention were censored at day-180 (6-months), which was the end of the follow-up period for the study.",

A disk clearance radius <6mm defined resistance for both S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. For H. influenzae, ampicillin resistance was defined by a clearance diameter <16mm, whereas a clearance diameter of either <10mm or between 10 and 49mm surrounding erythromycin disks identified resistance and intermediate-resistance respectively to azithromycin. Where CDS disk diffusion indicated resistance, E-test (AB bioMe\u00b4rieux, France) minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs; EUCAST, http://www.eucast.org) were used to determine the final resistance profile: S. pneumoniae (penicillin resistance: MIC >2 mg/L, intermediate resistance MIC >0.05-2 mg/L; azithromycin resistance: MIC >0\u00b75 mg/L, intermediate resistance MIC >0\u00b725-0\u00b75 mg/L) ) and S. aureus (azithromycin resistance MIC >2 mg/L, intermediate resistance MIC >1-2 mg/L). EUCAST antibiotic MIC breakpoints have not been validated for H. influenzae and were not used. A nitrocephin-based test detected beta-lactamase activity in H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. 1",
