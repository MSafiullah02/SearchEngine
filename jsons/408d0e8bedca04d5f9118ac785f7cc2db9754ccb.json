            "text": "We propose an actionable calibration procedure for general Quadratic Hawkes models of order book events (market orders, limit orders, cancellations). One of the main features of such models is to encode not only the influence of past events on future events but also, crucially, the influence of past price changes on such events. We show that the empirically calibrated quadratic kernel is well described by a diagonal contribution (that captures past realised volatility), plus a rank-one \"Zumbach\" contribution (that captures the effect of past trends). We find that the Zumbach kernel is a power-law of time, as are all other feedback kernels. As in many previous studies, the rate of truly exogenous events is found to be a small fraction of the total event rate. These two features suggest that the system is close to a critical point -in the sense that stronger feedback kernels would lead to instabilities.",

This obviously does not mean that significant news, such as the very recent Covid-19 crisis, do not impact financial markets, but rather that these only account for a small fraction of large price moves. Think for example of the S&P500 flash crash of May 6th, 2010 [6] , see also [7] , which has not been triggered by any outstanding piece of news. Furthermore, while one may argue that in some cases large drops are exogenously triggered, their amplification is often due to endogenous mechanisms [8] .",

The latter states that past price trends increase future activity, regardless of their sign. Quadratic Hawkes processes (Q-Hawkes), inspired by quadratic ARCH processes [28, 31] , were recently introduced to circumvent this issue [29, 32] , and have proven key to understand fat-tails in the distribution of returns, as well as spread, volatility and liquidity dynamics [5] .",

In particular, we empirically showed that Zumbach-like effects exist in order book data, i.e. past trends and volatility tend to promote future activity, and in particular cancellations that diminish liquidity and fragilise the system, possibly leading to a liquidity crisis. Combining Q-Hawkes processes with a stylized order book model [34, 35] revealed an interesting scenario with a second order phase transition between a stable regime for weak feedback and an unstable regime for strong feedback, in which liquidity crises arise with high probability. However, for such a scheme to be relevant for financial markets, the system must sit very close to the instability threshold (perhaps as the result of \"self-organised criticality\"). As an alternative scenario, we also proposed a non-linear Hawkes process which exhibits liquidity crises as occasional \"activated\" events, separating locally stable periods of normal activity.",

We provide convincing evidence for the price/liquidity feedback mechanism described above and quantify its implications. In section 2 we briefly recall the ingredients of the model and present the non-parametric calibration procedure, inspired by the methods introduced by Bacry et al. [36] [37] [38] . We apply such calibration to order book data on the EURO STOXX and BUND futures contracts. In section 3 we present an alternative method that needs fewer assumptions to compute the overall effect of past price moves on future liquidity flow. We introduce a low rank (Zumbach-like) approximation that allows us to denoise the feedback kernels and separate the effects of trend and volatility, and apply it to our futures contracts. In section 4, we focus on the liquidity flow and analyse spread time series in relation with adequate trend and volatility signals. Results appear to favour the \"self-organized criticality\" scenario over the metastable, \"activated\" scenario discussed above and in [5] . In section 5 we conclude.",

We will therefore not distinguish further bid and ask events in the following. Figure 2 (c) shows that the quadratic contribution cannot be reduced to the diagonal part K d only. Indeed, the off-diagonal contribution of the kernel is non-zero and rather long-ranged. The decay of the diagonal contribution is a power law with exponent \u2248 \u22121. Such a decay is very slow and means that ||K d || is logarithmically sensitive to long timescales, for which we do not have much information since we only use data belonging to the same trading day to avoid the thorny discussion of overnight effects and how to treat them. Finally, while the Hawkes and price feedback effects are difficult to compare as they do not operate on the same timescales, one can argue that the approximation presented at the end of Sec. 2.2.1 is well supported by data: considering a cut-off of 1000 seconds to compute the norms, one finds:",

Note that a causal positive impact of past trends on future spreads should translate as a strong contribution to C \u00b5 (\u03c4) for negative \u03c4. Interestingly, this is compatible with Fig. 6(b) , which confirms in a model-free fashion that the Zumbach-like coupling is important: past square trends increase future effective spread, or equivalently decrease future liquidity. While also slightly asymmetric, the volatility/spread correlation C \u03c3 (\u03c4) does not reveal such a level of asymmetry (see Fig. 6 (c)). Fig. 6(d) shows an even more pronounced asymmetry when we rescale the trend by the local volatility:",

We have shown that the empirically calibrated quadratic kernel (describing the part of the feedback that is independent of the sign of past returns) is well described by the shape postulated in [5, 29, 32] , namely:",

Hence, all Hawkes kernels in our study are found to be power-laws of time. Furthermore, as in many previous studies [11, 18, 25] , the rate of truly exogenous events is found to be much smaller than the total event rate, typically 1/5 when all kernels are truncated beyond 1000 seconds, and probably even smaller when longer lags are taken into account, due to the slow decay of the kernels. These two features suggest that the system is close to a critical point -in the sense that stronger feedback kernels would lead to instabilities. In our setting, we have shown that the effective spread (which is a measure of the (il-)liquidity of the order book) has itself a power-law tailed distribution, which we see as a precursor of the famous \"inverse cubic\" power-law tails of the return distribution (in the present context, see e.g. [28, 29] ). Such a power-law is not compatible with the alternative \"activated\" scenario proposed in [5] , which would rather suggest a bimodal distribution with a hump at large effective spreads. Hence, we favour at this stage the scenario of markets poised close to a point of instability, although the detailed mechanisms that lead to such a fine tuning are still somewhat obscure. We note that the near-criticality has also been argued to be crucial to understand the \"rough\" nature of volatility [32, 43, 44] . We believe that understanding these mechanisms is probably one of the most intellectually challenging (and exciting) issue for microstructure theorists. ",

Denoting \u2206t, \u2206x the time steps associated with times t and x, one has:Note that, as mentioned above, one can choose different time grids for the Hawkes and price contributions. Symmetry properties of the covariances enable us to estimate them only for positive times:One can reasonably assume that the covariances are 1 except in zero. [37] . Indeed, quadrature points in log-scale are well suited to accurately account for long range behaviour in the norm of the kernels. Consistently, it is advised to have time intervals increasing at the same rate as the grid of points we use. On the other hand, taking disjoined intervals [t \u2212 \u2206t/2, t + \u2206t/2] enables fast computations of the covariances. To enforce all of this, we compute the differences between the quadrature points, sort them and take the cumulative sum. This gives the disjoined time intervals suited for fast computations. Then, with linear interpolation, we obtain the final values on the quadrature points. Discretisation Equations (3) can be discretised in two different ways, using properties of the covariances and time grids. To show how to approximate the integrals, we provide an example of discretisation of + f (s)ds for an arbitrary function f using the time grid (t n ). The two possibilities are:",
