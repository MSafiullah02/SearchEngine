However, some patients with likely COVID-19 may have negative initial RT-PCR results for COVID-19, which may be due to insufficient cellular material for detection or improper extraction of nucleic acids from clinical materials. Thus, imaging examination, which can effectively and conveniently observe the pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities, can solve some challenges associated with clinical diagnosis in suspected patients with a false-negative result, especially symptomatic patients with dyspnea and respiratory distress.",

Among the studies that have been conducted, multifocal consolidation or ground-glass opacity (GGO) was observed on chest radiographs and CT [5\u20137]. However, the sensitivity of chest radiographs for pneumonia are relatively low, and it is difficult to use chest radiographs to distinguish COVID-19 from common pneumonia during the cold season and pneumonia caused by other coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections [8]. In addition, the disease is developing rapidly and the symptoms of this disease vary. Hence, it is very necessary to systematically analyze the chest CT findings associated with this disease systematically, for the timely isolation, COVID-19 RT-PCR and respiratory care of patients, and early implementation of infection prevention and control measures.",

All patients with COVID-19 were diagnosed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance [9] and were eventually confirmed by a positive result for RT-PCR analysis of the respiratory secretions samples. Confirmed patients were eligible if they experienced symptoms within 7 days, underwent an initial chest CT examination, and they had not received any antiviral treatment. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients who recently experienced clinically defined pulmonary infection attributable to other pathogens, (2) patients with severe artifacts on CT images, and (3) patients whose age was less than 18 years. According to the exclusion criteria, 7 patients who had pulmonary infections caused by other pathogens and 3 patients whose CT images had severe artifacts were excluded. Finally, 62 confirmed COVID-19 patients (34 men, 28 women; age range 20\u201391 years old) who had not received antiviral treatment were retrospectively reviewed. The workflow of COVID-19 patients selection is shown in Fig. 1. Most cases had a history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, in the absence of medical staff or family clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The main symptom of patients was fever, and secondary symptoms included cough, expectoration, dizziness, nasal congestion, and myalgia. According to the changes in this disease over time [10, 11], in our study, we defined patients with an onset of symptoms within 4 days as the early-stage group (18 men, 16 women; age range 20\u201372 years old) and patients with an onset of symptoms within 5\u20137 days as the progressive-stage group (16 men, 12 women; age range 22\u201391 years old). All patients underwent CT scans and laboratory examinations for C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, hemoglobin level, and procalcitonin level on admission.",

The initial chest CT data of 56 patients from Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital were obtained by using a 16-slice spiral CT scanner (Emotion 16 VC20B, Siemens Healthcare GmbH) with the following scanning protocol: a tube voltage of 120 kV, smart mA tube current modulation, a slice thickness of 1.5 mm, and a detector width of 1.5 mm. The initial chest CT data of the other 6 patients from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were obtained by using a 128-slice spiral CT scanner (Ingenuity CT, Philips Healthcare) with a similar scanning protocol: a tube voltage of 120 kV, smart mA tube current modulation, a matrix size of 512 \u00d7 512, a slice thickness of 1 mm, and a detector width of 0.625 mm. All patients were scanned in the supine position and at the suspended end-inspiratory volume, and the entire lung was scanned from the apex to the bottom [12]. To reduce discrepancies in the image acquisition parameters attributable to the different CT scanners, we resampled all voxels at 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 mm3 before image analysis. The multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) technique was performed to better observe images at the postprocessing station when necessary.",

Attention was paid to CT images with GGO, consolidation, GGO with consolidation, a reticular pattern, nodules, rounded opacities, cavitation, a crazy-paving pattern, an air bronchogram, a halo sign, bronchial wall thickening, a subpleural curvilinear line, and pulmonary fibrosis, and the presence, distribution, and size of these CT characteristics were assessed in all subjects. In addition, the presence of thoracic lymphadenopathy (lymph node size of greater than or equal to 10 mm in the short-axis dimension) and pleural effusion or thickening were also recorded. The distribution of each finding was classified as follows: central (predominantly in the inner two-thirds of the lung), peripheral (predominantly in the outer third of the lung), and diffuse (indications in multiple lung segments) [15]. Calculation of the CT score, a semiquantitative evaluation method, was applied to quantify the extent of COVID-19 according to previous studies [15, 16]. First, the scope of the lesions in each lobe was estimated and a score of 0 (none), 1 (affecting less than 5% of the lobe), 2 (affecting 5\u201325% of the lobe), 3 (affecting 26\u201349% of the lobe), 4 (affecting 50\u201375% of the lobe), or 5 (affecting more than 75% of the lobe) was assigned. Second, the CT score was obtained by adding up the scores of the five lobes. For each patient, the CT score was in the range of 0 to 25. All CT scans were independently reviewed and assessed by two chest radiologists (Z.F. and L.L.C., who had 18 years of experience in thoracic radiology, respectively). Disagreements in reader interpretation were settled by consensus agreement.",

Thus, we assigned patients to two groups according to the time of onset of symptoms to analyze the CT findings in early-stage and progressive-stage of COVID-19. In this study, 62 confirmed patients with COVID-19 underwent chest CT scans, and positive rate of detecting the pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities was 100%. In addition, the CT data in our study were obtained from the initial chest CT examination of patients who had not received any antiviral therapy; these results may better reflect the degree of viral infection and the immune system status before clinical intervention and provide an important basis for clinical classification, treatment strategy development, and prognosis prediction.",

In contrast, pulmonary fibrosis (1.6%) and pleural effusions (3.2%) were rare on chest CT images. These various CT findings are likely related to the complex pathological changes in the lungs of patients with COVID-19. Although pathological changes in the lung tissue of COVID-19 patients have not yet been studied, recent studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013like coronaviruses, with approximately 79% homology with SARS-CoV and approximately 50% homology with MERS-CoV [17, 18]. Because the pathogenesis of viral infections in the same family may be similar, previous studies on coronaviruses may be helpful in understanding the various CT findings in COVID-19 patients based on similar pathological changes. In SARS patients, pathological changes include injury to pulmonary epithelial cells, hyaline membrane formation on in the inner wall of the alveoli, and a large number of tissue cells and mass thrombi formed by proliferative fibrous tissue that block the small airway and air cavity [19]. These pathological changes may be the main pathological basis of the CT findings, especially the GGO.",

An analysis of thin-section CT images of SARS patients showed that multiple GGOs were the main imaging finding (68.4%) and were distributed in the periphery of the lung (71.8%), with interlobular septal thickening (24.2%) and intralobular interstitial hyperplasia (32.2%), also called the crazy-paving pattern. These findings are very similar to the CT manifestations of COVID-19 [20]. For pneumonia caused by MERS-CoV, GGO was also found on the chest CT images and was mainly distributed in the subpleural and basilar lung regions [21, 22]. Interestingly, pleural effusion was rare and no tree-in-bud pattern or cavitation was found in pneumonia patients infected by the three kinds of coronaviruses. In addition, we found that only one case of COVID-19 (1.6%) presented as consolidation without GGO. Compared with the large amount of consolidation that appears in the early stage of SARS, we speculate that the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 may be less than that of SARS-CoV [23]. Thus, it is necessary to fully understand and discriminate the CT features of COVID-19 at an early stage, which is helpful for the timely isolation and respiratory care of patients and early implementation of infection prevention measures.",

Similarly, in another chest CT study of a 33-year-old patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, multiple GGOs distributed in both the peripheral lungs were found [5].

In addition, there were no significant differences in the other CT findings or distribution of lesions between the two stages. For these findings, we speculated that the speed of GGO formation was due to the damage to the alveolar epithelium caused by the virus and may be similar to that of consolidation caused by an inflammatory reaction of the lung tissue, resulting in a change in different types of lesions during the synchronous increase in opacification. In pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV, Ooi et al found that GGO and consolidation formed in the first week of SARS-CoV infection increased in the second week, and only residual strips and reticular shadows were seen in the fourth week [15].

Moreover, CT scores showed a significant positive correlation with ages in all 62 patients (r = 0.255).
