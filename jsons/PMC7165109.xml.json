It was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 [1,3]. As of April 11, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 490,000 cases and 18,500 deaths in the United States, with all 50 states affected [2]. Over one million people are now infected worldwide [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. While much of the focus has been on the pulmonary complications, it is important for emergency clinicians to be aware of the cardiovascular complications, which can be a significant contributor to the mortality associated with this disease [[4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. This brief report will provide a focused overview of cardiovascular complications associated with COVID-19, including myocardial injury and myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure, dysrhythmias, and venous thromboembolic events (VTE).",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a protein found on the surface of lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine, which has been proposed as the entry site for SARS-CoV-2 [10]. ACE2 breaks down angiotensin II, a pro-inflammatory factor in the lung. Inhibition of ACE2 may be another factor in lung injury, as well as the cause of the systemic inflammation with cytokine release that can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction [[11], [12], [13]]. Disruption in immune system regulation, increased metabolic demand, and procoagulant activity likely account for some of the increased risk of adverse outcomes in those with COVID-19-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) [8,9,14]. Specifically, systemic inflammation can destabilize vascular plaques, while the viral illness increases cytokine activity, increasing cardiac demand, similar to influenza [15,16]. Recent research, however, has suggested that the virus may also cause direct damage to the heart utilizing ACE2 receptors located within cardiac tissue [17].",

One of the first reports of myocardial injury associated with SARS-CoV-2 was a study of 41 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, wherein 5 patients (12%) had a high-sensitivity troponin I above the threshold of 28 pg/mL [7]. Subsequent studies have found that myocardial injury with an elevated troponin level may occur in 7\u201317% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and 22\u201331% of those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [[7], [8], [9]]. Myocarditis has also been identified with high viral loads and mononuclear infiltrates identified on autopsy of some patients with COVID-19 [[26], [27], [28]]. In fact, one study suggested that up to 7% of COVID-19 related deaths were due to myocarditis [6].",

Patients with COVID-19 can present with chest pain, dyspnea, dysrhythmia, and acute left ventricular dysfunction [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. In patients with myocarditis and myocardial injury, serum troponin values will be abnormal. The electrocardiogram (ECG) can demonstrate a range of findings, in some cases mimicking acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The ECG abnormalities result from myocardial inflammation and include non-specific ST segment-T wave abnormalities, T wave inversion, and PR segment and ST segment deviations (depression and elevation). Echocardiography and consultation with cardiology, if either are available, is encouraged, as differentiating myocarditis and ACS is difficult. Echocardiographic evaluation is more likely to demonstrate a focal wall motion abnormality with active, significant ACS while severe forms of COVID-19-related myocarditis will show either no wall motion defects or global wall motion dysfunction [4,32]. ECG and echocardiographic abnormalities in the setting of COVID-19 are markers of illness severity and are correlated with worse outcomes [4,29,30]. Moreover, troponin elevations in patients with COVID-19 infection have been directly associated with an increased risk of adverse outcome in those patients with severe infection, including mortality [25,29,30].",

If PCI is pursued, staff should don appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and a full decontamination of the catheterization laboratory should be performed following the procedure. For suspected COVID-19 in the setting of NSTEMI, diagnostic testing prior to catheterization is recommended; the ACC note that, in properly selected patients with confirmed COVID-19, conservative therapy may be sufficient. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable in the setting of NSTEMI should be managed similarly to those with STEMI [32].",

Studies suggest significant coagulation pathway abnormalities in patients with COVID-19, including elevated D-dimer [7,8,[35], [36], [37], [38]]. One study of 25 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia found that an elevated D-dimer was present in all patients with a median of 6.06 micrograms/ml, with 10 patients having a pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosed on computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) [37]. Patients with confirmed PE on CTPA demonstrated a median D-dimer level of 11.07 micrograms/ml [37]. D-dimer levels greater than 1 \u03bcg/mL were associated with an increased risk of death during hospitalization (odds ratio 18.4) in COVID-19-infected patients [8].

Current medications under study include antivirals (e.g., remdesivir, ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir), antimalarials (e.g., chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine), azithromycin, corticosteroids, and biologics (tocilizumab) [4,[40], [41], [42]]. Lopinavir/ritonavir may cause QT and PR prolongation, particularly in those with baseline QT prolongation or in those taking medications that may cause QT prolongation [43]. These medications can also affect anticoagulant medications, antiplatelet agents, and statins [43]. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine affect the intracellular pH, which can result in electrolyte abnormalities, cardiotoxicity, and prolonged QT intervals; they may also interact with antiarrhythmic agents [44,45]. Methylprednisolone can cause electrolyte derangements, fluid retention, and hypertension [28]. A summary of the mechanism of action and effect of these medications is located in Table 1\n.",
