Eight of the nine cases identified were in First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit (FNMI) children and seven of those children had an underlying genetic immune deficiency (5 SCID, 1 interferon gamma receptor deficiency and 1 uncharacterized) [3]. Disseminated BCG disease is a rare but devastating complication of BCG vaccination in severely immune compromised infants. This lead to a re-evaluation of routine BCG vaccination practices in First Nations and Inuit communities. At the time, the frequency of SCID in Canada was unknown and Health Canada\u2019s First Nations and Inuit Health Branch (FNIHB) initiated a national surveillance study in collaboration with the Canadian Pediatric Society and pediatric academic centers across Canada. Acquiring this information was crucial to public health policy decision-making regarding the continued use of BCG vaccination in First Nations communities and the need for SCID newborn screening in Canada.",

Infants with HIV infection or cystic fibrosis were excluded. This case definition for SCID was less specific than the diagnostic criteria for SCID put forth in 1999 by PAGID (Pan-American Group for Immunodeficiency) and ESID (European Society for Immunodeficiencies) and updated in 2005, which requires additional criteria such as engraftment of trans-placental-acquired maternal T cells, a definitive genetic mutation or decreased proliferative responses to mitogens [6]. This was done in order to capture as many cases as possible. Two central study investigators (JR and AJ) reviewed each CPSP case report to determine if it was a definitive or probable case of SCID based on PAGID/ESID criteria.",

This may be due to founder effects caused by ancestral mutations in certain Aboriginal populations similar to the high frequency of T-B- SCID among Athabascan-speaking Native Americans [13]. In our FNMI cohort, we did not find a higher incidence of positive family history and/or consanguinity compared to the larger group, although the numbers are small. In order to calculate the incidence among FNMI children we estimated the number of FNMI births based on the FNMI percentage of the Canadian pediatric population using census data that reported the number of people stating Aboriginal identity among different age groups, as there are no complete statistics on birthrates among FNMI peoples of Canada.",

In one series of SCID patients, those receiving a transplant before 106 days (3.5 months of age), have a survival rate of 95 % compared to 76 % for those who received transplants when they were 3.5 months or older [15]. The average days at diagnosis in the current report for the confirmed cases was 125 days (4.2 months of age), despite positive risk factors and characteristic clinical signs in many instances. The average days at diagnosis for those patients that died was even shorter at 96 days. Seven patients died of infections before they could receive an HSCT. Thus, earlier diagnosis followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could potentially decrease the mortality in our population.",

            "text": "It is well established that neonatal diagnosis of SCID leads to significantly improved survival outcomes [16]. Diagnosis at birth could prevent the almost certain life-threatening infections and end-organ damage, thus improving transplant outcome. In our report, survival after transplant was 80 % (12/15 cases). However, key risk factors such as family history of SCID and infant death and consanguinity were only present in half of the reported cases. This has been the impetus for establishing neonatal screening programs for SCID. The first public health program to establish screening was in the state of Wisconsin, USA in 2008. Currently, half of all births in the United States are being screened for SCID as part of pilot or established state newborn screening programs. The standard approach for SCID screening is testing for T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), a DNA biomarker of normal T-cell development. They can be measured in DNA isolated from the dried bloodspots already collected for newborn screening [17]. TREC screening will not detect primary immunodeficiencies in the differential diagnosis of SCID such as ZAP70 and MHC class II and certain cases of ADA deficiency, but it does have the potential to detect other SCID-related and T lymphopenic disorders not captured in this study [18]. Universal screening for SCID has been predicted to be a cost effective means to improve quality and duration of life for children with SCID [19], but currently there is only one provincial neonatal screening program for SCID in Canada in Ontario. We believe that SCID fulfills requirements for addition to newborn screening panels in Canada. These criteria include: 1) SCID is fatal, often in the first year of life; 2) Newborns with SCID usually appear healthy at birth; 3) our estimated incidences support screening; 4) diagnostic testing is well-established; 5) curative treatment exists and earlier treatment leads to better outcomes; and 6) lastly there is a cost-effective and accurate screening tool.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to this national surveillance study. Investigators had no control over how the original data were collected and we acknowledge that some SCID cases may have been missed because of the exclusion criteria and general rate of participation in the CPS Surveillance Program. We do not know the exact fraction of the Canadian infant population that was captured by this surveillance study or the percentage of Canadian pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists represented in this study but we are encouraged by the national reporting rate of 80 % and high number of duplicate reports. The inclusion criteria we used was not as vigorous as those used by PAGID or ESID and in particular the use of an ALC < 3000/mm3 may have failed to capture patients with maternal T cell engraftment. This could also explain why our fraction of ADA deficiency cases was higher then expected. In contrast to other forms of SCID, maternal lymphoid engraftment is not observed with ADA deficiency [20]. Another possibility is the existence of founder mutations for ADA deficiency and ZAP70 SCID in Canadian old colony Mennonite populations. Unfortunately, this study did not capture any information about ethnicity beyond FNMI status. The use of a fixed ALC can also be problematic as the normal lymphocyte range is very age dependent. We believe that the current diagnostic criteria set forth by the Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC) as part of their prospective SCID study 6901 is the most rigorous description to date and should be employed in future studies [21]. The reporting form often had missing data in certain categories. Because of the many variables involved in the analysis, each with data missing for a number of cases, this can lead to biased results. Information reporting tends to favor interesting and unusual results rather then normal ones. This study further highlights the need for Canadian centers to register their primary immunodeficiency patients in registries such as the North American United States Immunodeficiency Network (USIDNET) and participate in multi-center SCID studies as part of the PIDTC in order to acquire more comprehensive data.",
